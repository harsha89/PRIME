My surgeon isn't sure what this means and is consulting with the pathologist and an oncologist on my behalf.  Hopefully, he'll have some news for me today when I go in to get my stitches removed. It seems we're considering removing a few additional lymph nodes (I LOVE the recovery from that--can't wait!), or getting the dots with chemo.  I wasn't in for chemo originally as it appeared my IDC hadn't spread, but who knows now... I do have to go in for a 3rd lumpectomy as we don't have clean margins, yet, so I may have additional nodes removed at that time or the port inserted, or both. I'm with Mamhop--gotta love all the indecision and waiting!  My poor mother can hardly cope with all the ups and downs, so I've taken to keeping things to myself till they somewhat resolve.  Problem with that is she expects news almost everyday and frankly, I don't have any!  Maybe today.  I will let you guys know what my doc says so you can put some real-life data in your arsenal.

Gonna ask my doc about the stuff you guys recommend next week.  But the reason I was gonna start a new thread was: Sometimes I feel so in control of this and then for some unknown reason (without prompt) I wanna cry.  I don't even have to be thinking about it.  Am I freaked out by my surgery?  Is this normal?  I'm not like this.  I married a Scandanavian (I know, not good for emotional things), so he isn't hard wired to get this, so I can't really ask him.  He's complimentary that I seem to be taking this so well, but he doesn't see me wanting to cry.  I feel like the dog, putting on a show when I'm down.  Deep down I know everyone must feel this way, but I have never been here before.  And I think I'm in for cancer-lite, how dare I?  Can anyone validate, or should I just grow up?  Sorry to be so heavy on a Saturday.  Particularly when Bob Saget is being bad on HBO!

Now it appears the Taxotere is going to claim a couple of my toenails (managed to keep the fingernails, somehow), so I've skipped the full blown pedi the last two times in favor of just a polish change (I'm concerned the sitting in water will encourage those nails to jump ship).  This seems to be working for now. IF I do lose my nails, I'm going to have my tech just put acrylics on the missing nails and move on.  I am NOT going to compromise my need for pretty toes, because as you so correctly pointed out, it's sandal weather!!!

Hey Carol, if no one wants the books--I'll take them.  I actually rooted around a Barnes & Noble last weekend in search of them, but didn't have title and author info with me and for the life of me could not remember any of it.  So I came home empty handed.  I'll return them to you, or forward to another reader when I'm through, whatever your preference.  Thanks.  Oh, I just saw that Paula wants Wendi's book, so I'll wait for her to finish that one.  If you still need some eyes for Deanna's book, I'll start there. Speaking of Paula, hang in there.  You've been really active lately, which must make your head feel good, but take care of your body, too.  Oh, and I did ask babydoc about pure aloe vera today, but the lotion I'm using has aloe in it, so he didn't think I'd need it.  I hope he's right. Julie--I'm sending you high energy thoughts for tomorrow.  You need a good day before tx. LWDana--Good to hear you are putting your misunderstanding behind you.  Besides, you need to save your energy for other, more important, battles right now.

It's downright hot here today.  Temps in the 80's (sorry Tinalee, I saw your snowy forecast) and humid.  Feels like summer in April.  Oak pollen is almost unbearable.  I'm hoping that the reason I was gasping for air during my aerobic workout on Thurs and Fri was due to the pollen-not my diminished lung capacity thanks to rads. Dd's ankle is improving (quite the color palette she's got going), and she got lucky today.  Only one game scheduled today and the opponent didn't show, so my kiddo got to rest the ankle one more day.  She has two games tomorrow, so fingers are crossed that it's all good...  (I'm a little ticked, however, since we drove 45 minutes each way to get to this gym and gas prices are so high...) Good to hear from you, Sheshe.  I hope your pulled muscle loosens up soon.  I hate those.  Loved your shout-outs, good read. KathyL-Yikes, an ear infection!  My dh had one about 10 years ago and was dizzy with pain from it.  Hope your abx kick in real soon.  As for obsessing about recurrence.  Hmm.  Well, I should state up front that I've never been what I'd call a reactionary patient.  I tend to wait with symptoms till my next regularly scheduled check-up (in fact, that's what I did when I found my lump and I even KNEW the lump was bad news-intuition, I guess).  But, I've been in asking anyone on my med team who will listen to me whenever I feel something new in my body nowadays, or when I have pains that I can't explain away to nerve regeneration or something.  I'm not really wild about this side of me, but I'm hopeful that as I continue on my journey that I will begin to relax again.  I think part of this is learning to cope with our new realities about health.  We have to give ourselves time to adjust.  I mean, we've been told all of our lives that unchecked cancer can mean death.  Well, heck, aren't we all cheating death right now?  And don't you think that can get in our heads, even if we don't want to admit it out loud?  Time, KathyL, give it time.  (I'll be interested in SIS Kimberly's take, once she comes in from the fog.)

Those rad contortions are hard on the body.  I try to keep separating and connecting my fingers together to keep them awake.  You can't really move that arm, but move your fingers about a little.  It has helped me with the tingling/sleeping arm.  Hopefully, as you get farther along, they won't take as long and your arm won't have the problems. Good thoughts to Denise on Monday.  I'm glad you two are spending more time together.  Sisters are such a gift.  (Remind me of that after I spend 60 hours with mine later this month.) Wish I could get my dh to put cream on my boob... Maz--you go, girl!  Give yourself time to mourn Val.  You need to do that for yourself.  As for that let-down feeling after chemo--you're normal.  Several of us here have had that experience, and you're having it on top of Val's death.  Your feelings are all okay.  Give yourself some time.  Roll with your fog and come out all the stronger (but please don't stay too long).

And even more excitement-I sent my first prize off to my secret pal today!  I hope it makes her happy to receive it. LJ13 (Bonehead)-I cannot believe you're at the end of this phase of tx!  You must be a little jazzed to hear what your onc will have to say next week.  Fingers are crossed that chemo did it's thang and you can move on.  You'll be just fine with the rads.  The trick seems to be stay active and hydrate (sound familiar?).  Let us know how your scans and doc appts go. SIS Kimberly-You should have your exchange scheduled by now (if I read on, I'm sure I'll see your post).  I really hope it works in with your cation plans this summer.  You sound like you've got some pent up cationing that needs your attention!  Yep, I see you were able to work it in.  Now, you need to get those walks in as physical fitness will help you recover faster.  Get up.  Get up, now! Oh, before I forget, the doggy party was a private affair for Kippy and me.  This neighbor is elderly and Kip and I have walked with her for years (mostly cause she had an older dog that wouldn't walk unless there was another dog there dragging her along).  Well, the older dog died a little more than a year ago and my neighbor was lonely (even though Kip and I still invited her on our walks).  So I helped her find a rescue dog.  Then I kinda disappeared during chemo tx (my onc wouldn't let me pick up dog poo, so we hired a walker).  Now my neighbor is so happy to have us back that she invited us to the party.  It was so sweet of her.  Kippy wasn't too wild about the Frosty Paws dog ice cream, but she's now getting on in years and has never seen that stuff before.  She would eat it if I picked little bite sized pieces off and hand fed them-how Cleopatra of her!  Anyway, it was very nice and short as I had to get to my tanning session. I hope you like your new ta-ta's, Therese.  Sounds like you fairly breezed through your exchange surgery.  Now I hope your recovery is speedy and painless.  LOL at the washcloth story!!  Priceless!!! PALady-You ARE done!!! Yay!!!  I completely understand the tears.  I felt funny when I left my zap today and I'm not sure, but I think I'll be misty when I have the last one tomorrow.  I've got the label ready to send the Deanna Farve book off to you, but I probably won't get to the P.O. till next week as my car goes in the shop tomorrow and we're adding another driver to the mix tonight (college girl comes home tonight!), creating a little vehicular congestion around here.  I'll get it to you, though. Carol-sounds like you and the ex have compromised some on the driver's license.  The ds still has some goals to meet, but they sound totally doable to me.  Lawn mowing sounds good.  Another local idea is to see if there's a summer camp at your neighborhood elementary school and apply to be a counselor (that's a really popular summer job around here).  Also, can he do some dog walking?  Kids get $10/walk around here!  Makes me want to walk dogs for some pocket change.  The only problem with that is, you have to walk the dogs no matter the weather-I don't even walk my own dog when it's raining! Does Paula's son play for the Mariners?  COL (cackle out loud) on that one. Heck, Carol, maybe you could use that new mustache for a comb-over to thicken up your hair.  You keep mentioning how thin it's getting... Boy, I hear you on the scheduling, CathyCA.  I was griping to someone recently that it's a good thing I don't have a life anymore as I'm so not in charge of my time these days.  The rads people are always giving me a little card with my appointment time on it and I don't have any input into the times.  I've had to get cranky a couple of times to get what I wanted, but I have occasionally taken in baked goods and that seems to smooth ruffled feathers.  Your attitude sounds great as you get ready for the next phase of your tx.  I think we'll all be so relieved when we get the chemo part behind us!  Oh, and the tastebud timeframe is just about what I experienced.  The tip of my tongue is still numb (as are finger and toe tips), which makes licking my lips a real trip.  I'm hoping that clears one of these days... Julie, you party animal you.  I can't remember the last time I was up till 1a! Gotta run the vacuum around before dh and college girl get here, so I should sign off for now.  Next time I'm on here, I'll be done with rads!!!! D1",

Babydoc was so sweet to me today.  He wanted to take a look at Frankenboob to see how things were doing and gave me a little pep talk about taking the next step in treatment.  I told him he has been my fav so far and told him it was because he always gave me full disclosure, even if what he had to say was scary to me.  I see him again in 4-6 weeks for I don't know what.  There was much fist pounding and hugging with the techs when I finished and even the folks in the waiting room were cheering for me!  Just made me feel really good about myself.  I didn't cry when I got into the car-and haven't, yet-but I have an overwhelming sense of pride in myself for having gotten through all this sh*t with a smile on my face.  (Kinda weird to be proud of yourself for getting through tx, but that's what I'm feeling.)  Honestly, you'd think I'd just won the \"Greatest American\" award with how I feel. The plan here is to hold on to that feeling as long as I can.  I see my legu 2x a week for some time to come, but I don't have a doc's appointment till May 21.  YIPPEE! Glad you're getting your walks in, SIS Kimberly.  I'm convinced that exercise (and hydration) is the critical ingredient to our recoveries and overall wellness.  Keep it up. Spring Sing sounds so sweet.  Enjoy those angelic voices. Happy birthday to Joan!  Happy birthday to Joan!  Happy birthday, dear Jo-o-o-an!  Happy birthday to Joan!  (You can all be glad you didn't have endure my actual singing.) Joan, put the Aquaphor on every time after tanning and before bed.  Don't wait for it to get red.  The goal is to keep your skin as hydrated as possible to avoid nasty burns or peeling.  There are no guarantees, of course, but better to do what you can.  Oh, and you can use the Tom's of Maine unscented deodorant.  Apparently, it doesn't contain trace metals or something and is gentler to your burned skin.  Also, I was told to use Dove soap only as it's gentle. So glad the new job is looking good, KathyL.  You're really a trooper.  Try to enjoy reconnecting with some of your childhood at your friend's mother's memorial service.  I know its not the happiest reason to see those folks again, but I'm sure you'll find some smiles somewhere. Ah, DWTS.  MJW goes next.  She is improving, but she's not going to win it.  And, yes, Jason did appear to be relieved with the AI results.  I'll miss his cute aw-shucks attitude, but David C is the man, IMO.  That little David A makes me crazy with his breathy singing-I'm not a fan. And, um, you wanna talk about the SP loser?  Do you remember that SIS Kimberly had to postpone the start of the festivities because I was so lame that I couldn't get my cards and envelopes to her?  No, you have to get in line behind me for that title. Carol-You asked your doc the same things I want to know about ooph/hysterectomy/drugs.  I'm interested in hearing the pros and cons of all the se's and want to make my choice with as much info as I can.  Thanks for sharing your doc's take.  It's almost like getting a second opinion (I said ALMOST-no stirrups involved for me!).  Drive carefully to Portland-tell the ds to stay on his skates this time.  Just read that today is his b-day!  Happy wishes to him! Oh, and I totally nodded in agreement with your comment on how far we've come in a short time.  It's amazing, isn't it?  Thanks for paying it forward with Kalen and your \"lobular\" sister. LOL at the Chicken Little image, LWDana!  Yep, talk to your doc about your se's.  From what I understand, they have lots of drugs from which they can choose.  Hang in there. Paula-Oh, that room is cold, isn't it?  My nipples were always at attention.  I felt a little odd about it at first, but then I got used to all the folks coming in to see me prone on the table with my Frankenboob out for the world to see.  Please see my comments to Joan about using whatever lotion your shop recommends.  It's VERY important. Thanks for the happy dancers, Julie.  I was wondering how to put some in to this post, and hoped that our resident animation expert would take care of that for me.  I didn't even have to ask-you're on it!!! You had a Spring Sing, too?  I'm glad you were able to make it for your niece.  Those connections are precious. Yep, Jules Rules! PALady-You know, I fully expected to react to being done like you are, but as you read, I'm in a different space right now.  I wonder, since I kinda felt emotional on Thursday when I only had one left, if it'll come later for me.  It will be interesting to see how I develop. My skin is very itchy and has a rougher texture than it used to.  It's also pretty red.  I'm not much liking stuff rubbing on it, but that's one good thing about the compression garment I have to wear-once I get past that first ouchie-wa-wa when I put it on, it doesn't move, so no rubbing on my sensitive skin.  Maybe that d*mn thing is a blessing...  (Naw.) Hair is just pathetic.  Still no color and thin and sparse.  AND I have a couple of ingrown hair pimples that stick farther off my head than the hair does!  (Lovely sight.)  I just ate some jello (been trying to get some everyday), hoping it will help things along. Good to hear from you, Peg.  Congrats on finishing chemo.  I'm sorry to read about your son-I hope he returns to you very soon.  You'll be in my thoughts. SIS Kimberly-thanks for taking the initiate to check on some of our MIA Jewels.  It's important to make sure everyone is doing okay. Well, I'm off to try on everything in my closet in the hope that something appropriate for a nice dinner will fit, won't show my garment and will match one of my doo-rags.  It's so complicated to be a girl...

The second study is more interesting to me, as it was an issue that plagued my decision over whether or not to do chemo.  The study will use blood tests to determine my exact time of menopause and gauge the use of Tamox vs. AI in relation to menopause.  Since my menopause status was a huge factor in my decision to do chemo, finding a way to better detect the onset of menopause through blood work appeals to me (if I'd been truly post-menopausal, I would not have done chemo, but my blood tests were inconclusive).  I need to learn more about this study, but the doctor said I need to first decide about the other study and then move on to this one because of timing issues with the first one.  Guess my poor brain has lots to absorb in the next two weeks (they want me to decide and get going 4 weeks after my last rad-which is in 2 weeks!). As soon as I crossed the threshold at home following my onc visit, the computer guy arrived.  I spent the next 4 hours learning about our computers-not what my poor brain needed!!   (So if I'm incoherent here, that's my excuse.) SIS Kimberly (or 6F/3-Six Foobies divided by 3)-The enchiladas were really good.  I use a \"diet\" recipe that doesn't make anyone feel guilty.  I wish you could've had some, too.  Glad to hear you exercised.  You need to start somewhere.  The key is to make it part of your lifestyle.  Keep pushing yourself to do it and eventually you'll find that you \"want\" to do it because it makes you feel good about yourself. I really liked the pics.   You look fabo-as to be expected.  It was so nice to see so many people clearly celebrating the day.  I hope I do something like that real soon. KathyL-glad to hear you're getting some \"down time,\" but it's kinda sick that you have to go in for an infusion to get it...the new reality, right?  Sounds like the job situations (both of them) are working out for you.   Another example to all of us that everything is for the best. Hmmm, Carol, the male therapist thing would make me pause too.  You have a good attitude/expectation about it, so you should be in good hands (is that a pun?  Not sure.).  I have cleaning people, too, but they never do as good a job as I like.  I went through lots of cleaning people until I realized that no one would be good enough, so I settled on a team that dusts the shit out of my house, since I hate to dust. Here's wishing for a great razor for Kris' legs! Doh, Therese, I just read your post.  Sorry I didn't slow down for \"us\" today.  Maybe tomorrow???? WOW, LJ13-GREAT news about your scan and exam!!!  You must be thrilled (try not to temper your excitement too much worrying about your surgery next week.  You're strong and will come through with flying colors.  As you say, worry is a misuse of the imagination.) Talk about a whirling dervish, SIS Kimberly, just read about your day.  The best part is \"Jewel!!\"  How cool is that??? Tinalee-So glad to hear another exchange went okay.  We're hooked on Deadliest Catch around here, too (okay, I liked that pun, hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did).  Switty, swassy, toematoe, toemahtoe, it's all the same to me! Hey, KathyL, I like that-our Carol is the unique one!  It fits, Carol, I'd roll with it. LWDana-Oh man, choices like that are so hard.  Before you move ahead with ovary removal, why don't you talk to your doc about your desire to have biological kids?  They can freeze some of your eggs, or something, these days, if that's important to you.  Also, talk to your doc about your questions.  Sometimes we have to go home and mull things over before we realize the questions we have.  It's his job to make sure you understand your options, so do your homework and arm yourself with the questions that dog you.  Don't be rushed into anything until you understand it (unless its medically necessary, of course.)  You need to be at peace with your decision, so ask until you feel you're ready to commit.  These are all personal decisions and know you have support in yours. Twas a good week for reality tv.  Both DWTS and AI chose the right one, IMO (like they asked me!).  I'm really excited about AI-can't wait for some stuff to download from him. Well, almost 11p here.  My brain has been so taxed today its mushy.  I couldn't even enjoy my glass of wine I'm so out of it.  I think I need some sleep... D1",

CathyCA-I'm sorry your rad onc isn't great.  He's been my favorite doc so far in my journey.  The folks who are attentive to my pains are in the physical therapy shop.  I started there when I was having my back spasms from the neulasta and moved on to a lymphedema specialist when my back therapist helped me with my diagnosis (I did need a script from a doc to get started and after my onc demurred, I asked my surgeon for one, the one good thing he did for me).  My lymphedema specialist, (or legu, as I call her here), has been great.  She actually believes me when I say something hurts and gets the other therapists involved when needed.  I feel like such a hypochondriac, but apparently, my aches and pains are for real-who knew?  Luckily, my insurance is good when it comes to therapy, so all of this is good.  I just hope I get some relief! Ummm, raspberries.  I remember we had them on our farm when I was a kid.  I hated picking them because the mosquitoes were deadly in the raspberry patch.  But the bounty was so fab!!! Hope you voted.  I love democracy. Glad the storms were kind to you, Jenn.  It's so refreshing to hear from you-even if you had to sign off for the pizza!  (Food always gets me off the computer!) Hey Carol, I'll take a pain in the shoulder over a pain in the ass any day (who knows what a pain in the ass can be??).  Hope you're doing okay after infusion day. Got a call from an old colleague tonight.  She was trying to remember an incentive plan I implemented when we worked together some 20 years ago.  It really made me feel good to hear her cite how the plan worked from her perspective.  Now I'm on the hook to dig up my documentation and send it her way so she can help others in her firm become more marketing oriented.  I hope I still have some details around here, because she remembered the plan far better than I!!  (She did say the benchmarks in the plan scared her at first because she was an accountant and not used to thinking about marketing, but she admitted that the outreach activities she started 20 years ago are ones she is still doing-amazing to think I had an impact.) Okay, so maybe life is good.  I'm so glad someone called to remind me that I've made some positive impact.  It gives me encouragement. Tomorrow the painters arrive... D1",

Oh Paula, I'm so sorry you and dh got some disappointing news.  I know what you mean about the Phase I trials, they kinda scare me, too.  But I doubt the docs at Duke would take a chance on something they didn't think would help dh.  They have such a great reputation (as we've acknowledged, even Ted Kennedy traveled there), and they don't want to do anything to jeopardize that.  Between your research, the help of your niece, and your docs, I'm sure you will make the right decision for dh.  I'm sorry you guys are having to deal with this, but I have every confidence that you will do the right thing. KathyL-so good to hear from you.  I know you've been busy, but I've really missed your regularly scheduled insights.  You'll get a kick out of this, I'm having the walls painted, but I'm painting them, you guessed it-white!  My dh is such a Scandinavian that I don't get choices in this regard.  I did get him to agree to painting the punchout in our breakfast nook yellow-that's progress.  I remember 5 years ago when we painted our bedroom and the girls teased us about agonizing over the white paint chips.  (I managed to get that room done in a light taupe!)  I just try to liven things up with throw pillows and such. I'm glad to hear you're signing up to give back to the cancer community.  I wish I could be there to see you shake the girls!!!!  Speaking of the girls, it sounds like the nipple tat wasn't too bad.  My college girl has several tattoos and it only takes a couple of days for things to heal up.  One of her tats is a solid star, so it's probably a lot like your nipple.  It did scab over a bit, but healed really quickly.  Just keep the anti-bacterial on it and keep it clean till it scabs and you should be good.  (Who am I, giving medical advice to our resident med guru????) Hey, and channel away if you get free stuff out of it!!! I want to get back to SIS Kimberly's comment about her doc not being happy with her rad/HT choice.  You know, this is all so difficult for all of us.  We're trying to take in the information and make the best decisions we can for ourselves.  And there's the key-we're deciding for OURSELVES.  Each of us is making choices that we can live with, not for anyone else.  You have every right to make the choice that's best for you.  Don't let your doctors make you feel bad because you're choosing a path different from the one they want for you.  I know I've made decisions contrary to my doc's advice a couple of times on this journey and the key for me has been to be at peace with whatever I decide.  So if you're at peace, Kimberly, move on and don't look back. Okay, off the soapbox.  Gonna go check on my painters. D1",

Dd received the Excellence in American Literature Award at her high school tonight.  I was proud.  And to top it off, her SOL (our standardized tests in Virginia) for writing arrived today and she got a perfect score!  I was impressed, but she just shrugged it off saying the SOL's are easy so everyone can pass and get out of high school.  I dunno, but I've never had a kid score perfectly on those before, so I was still proud. Our dog had her checkup today and she needs to lose one pound (if I could be so lucky) and must have her teeth cleaned.  The vet has been talking about it for at least 3 years, so I knew it was coming (we're bad parents and don't brush her teeth).  Unfortunately, she'll be anesthetized, so I'm all a twitter worrying about her.  This appointment isn't till July 14, so I'm sure you'll be really tired of me whining about it by then... Jenn-I'm so happy you got some color in your hair!!!  I cannot wait till I get mine.  Like you, my new hair is mostly white (well, you said you were salt-n-pepa), and dd told me that I can go topless as soon as I get it colored so I don't look so old.  Are you going topless now?  The weeds are winning in my yard, too.  But I did manage to get some flowers planted around them, so I try to overlook the weeds and know they'll come out when I have the energy to take them out.  LOL at your trip to the men's room!  I experience lost in translation moments myself all the time-and those are generally in English! Carol-WOOO HOOO!!!!  Way to go out in Spidey style!  Pretty soon it'll be Sunday and you'll be downing that last pill and it's OVER.  Glad you're still smiling.  (Oh, and Marty Feldman...honestly.)  Hope the stim goes swimmingly tomorrow.  I'll be thinking of ya. Sherry-Don't worry about going back thru the thread.  Just pick up from here.  I'm doing Tamoxifen, too.  I just started on Tuesday.  I haven't noticed that it makes me sleepy, yet, but I've only taken 2 pills so far.  As a fellow nipple blisterer, I can totally relate to your pain.  Keep it lubricated with whatever salve your rad onc recommends.  It will help. I must've lotioned myself 6x a day during rads and then cut back to 4x a day for the 2 weeks afterwards.  I'm coming up on 5 weeks out now and I'm still lubing 2x a day.  Drinking lots of water and exercise (which I see you're doing) also helps.  Hang in there. Boy, I know the looks, Julie.  Sometimes they are hard to take, aren't they?  I think meltdowns are totally justified.  This has been a long, difficult journey for all of us.  If you need some space, I say take it. I can't tell if the Tamox is adding to my sweats, either, Tina.  I've been taking it in the morning with my vitamin as I'm not sure I'd be as vigilant with a nighttime med.  I'm only taking a multiple vitamin.  Should I be looking at other supplements?  I'm trying to get an appointment with my gyn soon to get a full on exam so we can establish a baseline on me before the Tamox takes a firm grip.  He's totally into alternative tx, so maybe he can help me with supplements.  (Just thinking about him makes me excited to see him-I've been with him for almost 30 years and love him to pieces and pieces.)  (Oh, I'm not excited about the exam, but we try to talk through that...) Okay, Carol, I'm loving your dh.  Although you are TOTALLY whakko 24/7. Hey LWDana, how ya doin? Can't wait to see the pix, KathyL (but don't let that add any stress, okay?).  Baseline on the bone density sounds like a good idea to me.  Maybe I'll bring it up at my gyn visit. WOOOHOOO SISKimberly gets the drains out tomorrow!!!!!  Good luck!  (How'd the cleaning people do?) Good Gawd, Kathy, it looks like you're strangling your dove!!!!  (LOVE the pics, thanks for taking the time to figure it out.) Ah, Cream of Wheat, things are aligned in the universe again... Till tomorrow, Jewels. D1",

Also called my mom to convince her to attend her family reunion over the 4th of July.  My cousin is hosting this time and it's only 2 hours away from where I live!  I have no excuse.  So my one sis and her family are arriving here on July 1 to do some visiting and sightseeing, then our families will drive to the reunion site in a caravan.  My other sis is spending more time in the southern part of the state with her dh and dd to do some sightseeing and will meet us at the reunion site.  I'm hoping my mom chooses to tag along with them (they're coming from the same part of the world and have room in their car-only 1 kid).  It would be fab if we can all get together as one of my bil's is a photographer and will take a family photo.  Since my kids are starting to drift off with the wind, I'm not sure there will ever be another opportunity for a photo like that.  If my mom decides not to come, then my sisters and our families will take the pic w/o her.  It would be a shame, but I'll still treasure it.  Anyway, that call took up a lot of time. So, what's up here? Joan, you're getting to the end of rads!  Hooray!  You'll be surprised at how quickly you forget all about the hassle of driving in for tx everyday.  Hang in there. Wow, Kris, only 4 more!!!  Yay for you!  So far nothing new on the Tamox, unless I can blame it for the continuous hot flashes... More good news from PALady!  A clean PET-WOOOHOOO!  It's funny you'd mention laser hair removal to the bikini area.  I had that done, too, and am noticing more hair coming back after chemo.  I wonder if we could go in and buy a \"mini\" package to touch things up?  And how long do we wait till we're sure nothing more is coming in?  It's so expensive to have that done, but I was a new woman once I did it. SISKimberly-Hope the cleaning snafu isn't a bad sign.  I hate rescheduling that stuff.  Although another movie isn't a bad thing.  And the drains are out!!!!!  Yippee skippee!!  Enjoy a nice shower and a good night's sleep on your side.  You deserve it. My kids keep asking me why I'm toting this candle around with me today.  Well, I've been enjoying an aroma therapy candle from my SP this afternoon and can't make myself blow it out, so I move it with me when I move.  The girls think I'm crazy, but I proved that long ago so I don't know what they're talking about!  Thanks SP! Off to clean the green beans for dinner. D1",

So now I'm on the market for a small, crossbody handbag to hold my sunglasses, passports, tampons (for the girls now!), combs (again for the girls), pens and whatnot on cation since I've been prohibited to carry my backpack.  I found something cute yesty at Macy's by Fossil (and Macy's was having their sale-goodie), but the leather was too light in color for my taste.  I came home to search it out online, but it must be discontinued.  Too bad.  The bag zipped all the way open to reveal two gosseted compartments lined with handy card and pen holders and a zippered coin purse dividing the compartments.  It also had a pocket on both outsides-handy for airline tix as we rush through the airport.  All in a 8x5x3\" bag.  Perfect.  I'm going to see if I can muster anyone in my family to check out another Macy's today (this after I clean my main level as the inlaws are coming for dinner). Clearly I'm all about the selfish passions today.  What's up with everyone else?  I'm anxious to hear how Carol's Race went. So where do I start?  With Carol's comment on foreplay!  What has happened to us???!!  Ah, now I understand what your v-scan was.  I just called that my \"sim.\"  It's the one where they make you contort for the marathon session, just to see how you hold up!!  And then they give you the tats while you're all contorted and stiff and vulnerable-just to check on your pain thresholds at that point.  Yes, I know the scan.  It will get better-just stick to the three must do's:  butter, hydrate and exercise.  (The butter, natch, replacing lubing for the rest of us.) Ummm, Carla, the cake sounds delish, and so summery!  A fine choice for your celebration! And hooray for Joan!!!!!  Can you believe rads are behind you?  It was amazing to me how quickly I adjusted to NOT having to drive to the hospital everyday! Hey, I keep meaning to ask you to share a little info on the winter months up in Poughkeepsie.  Dd is pretty serious about Vassar (if she doesn't get in I'm hoping I won't have to talk her off a window ledge), but we're all a little concerned about Winter (yep, we're southerners).  When does the snow kick in, how deep is it, how long does winter last?  Is it mostly snowy, or cold rain?  Windy?  You know, just the full meteorological report will do.  ;)  She's thinking of applying Early Admission, which means her app will have to be in before the next winter and if she's accepted, she's bound to attend, so we're going to have to evaluate if Winter is tolerable from others' reports.  (Frankly, as a product of Michigan, I don't see this as a problem, but my kids are from Virginia and don't have much winter experience.)  Thanks. You go, KathyL!!!  Must be the boob job that did dh in!  I'm totally jealous.  (You were so giddy that your computer started hiccupping!)  Hey, thanks for keeping track of us. Hang in there, Kris!  We're rooting for ya! Great pics from your Race, Carol!  I felt exactly the same way about too many pink shirts, but I was happy to be wearing one.  (And we had a similar experience with the folks walking with photos of their loved ones on their backs-brings it all home, doesn't it?)  I'm so amazed/impressed that ds got up to walk with you.  I don't think my girls would do that (and their dad would not make them feel that they had to).  Please tell ds I think he's a good kid. Julie-another Jewel participating in the Race this weekend!  Hope to see pics from you soon. CathyCA-yeah the heat really revs up the rad field, doesn't it?  I still get warm, particularly where I got the boosts, when it's hot out. I did the extra long package, too.  It was actually cheaper than buying each piece separately.  I did not spring for the package with the foam mattress topper in it (I'm too cheap and I believe that a little discomfort is part of the college experience) and college girl said the springs in the mattress were awful-so we bought one of those.  She was also using an old blanket from around the house that wasn't extra long (this was in addition to the comforter on those cold nights) and so I figured it was time to get her a proper blanket.  We were also on the hook for a piece of carpeting, since college girl's roommate from last year provided all the floor coverings, and she's rooming with someone else next year.  I guess this worked out better for us as it spread some of the financial output over two years.  Next up-dd will get all of her college supplies NEXT summer!  It's always sumthin.' Well, dd is up and breakfasting, so I should go spend a little time with her before she heads off to work.  She's working 10-6 today!  Bless her little pointed head. D1",

So, I vacuumed everything, including the hide-a-bed (which I first sprinkled with baking soda).  Then I washed all the sheets and bed pad (even though they were washed after the last use before I put them away-I wanted them to smell fresh).  After that, I was able to make up the bed.  Then I ran around the house with a level and straightened all the pictures on the walls.  I rarely do that and the cleaning people leave them all akimbo, just to show me that they were dusted, I think. Of course, while I had the vacuum out, I ran it around the main level for our enjoyment this weekend (okay, my enjoyment this weekend).  In between all of this, I washed my sheets and put them back on the bed (like everyone else here, that's becoming a common chore with all the sweating I do).  I also did a couple other loads of laundry, just for good measure.  Anyway, I'm tired. Congrats, Carol, you made it through the first week of rads!  Enjoy your walks this weekend-just listen to your body and give it a break when it asks for one.  Whew!  Glad the house wasn't on fire!!!! Hope the arm held up for the rads sim, LJ13.  The sim is harder on the arm than the actual rads (although putting your arm in that position every single day for 6 weeks or so does take its toll).  And did you ever get your arm checked out?  (My guess is no and now you're going to learn today why I was pushing you to do it...  Let me say \"I told you so!\"  I'm shaking my head and tsk tsking.)  I'll give you the same advice I give all the other rad Queens-hydrate, lubricate and exercise.  Seriously.  Deb, what a relief to hear from you!  We've missed you!  If you look back on the thread, you'll see that we celebrated your 50th birthday without you!  So happy belated.  (I turned 50 in February, so I feel your pain.) Speaking of feeling your pain, I'm sorry to read that you and I are the lymphedema queens amongst the Jewels.  LE really sucks, doesn't it?  I only have it in one arm, torso, shoulderblade and the worst is my armpit-it's all swollen.  I see a le therapist 2x a week for MLD.  Is your OT performing MLD on you?  The only good thing about it is that it's relaxing.  I'm having some trouble accepting that this is a lifelong affliction-I keep thinking that with p/t it'll go away.  But my le therapist says no.  (In fact, you'll see my most recent posts are struggling with the reality that I have to buy a machine to simulate MLD at home.)  I don't wear my gloves much now as we've gotten my arm down 3/4 of an inch and I'm trying to be a good girl and not aggravate it.  But I do wear the sleeve and a compression garment every day.  No one sees the garment (good thing, its butt-ugly), but I pretend I'm like Allen Iverson, who wears a sleeve to play ball, just to keep my attitude in check.  In fact, I just went and ordered me a 2nd sleeve today so I can wear a clean one more often (I'm grossing myself out here).  Anytime you want to bitch about le, I'm around.  It sucks. I'm kinda confused about the Arimidex, too.  I didn't know they gave it to trip negs, either.  I'm starting on Tamoxifen and will switch to Arimidex for a total of 5-10 years of pills, too.  I had a really hard time starting the Tamox because I wanted it all to be over.  But I'm taking it every day and combating the hot flashes that go with it (refer to my constant sheet washing comment above). I think you're on the right track to get yourself a tm and start using it.  Don't go too cheap on it, you'll find it's worth spending a little more to get a good one (we had a cheap one from Sears first and then threw it out after a few years and ponied up for a good one and have had it for probably 7 years and it gets used all the time).  And the other treats you're doing for yourself sound perfect!  I'm disappointed in myself that it took cancer for me to start paying attention to my needs and interests, but at least we're all starting to take care of ourselves!  There's a silver lining for you!  Don't be such a stranger. You know what guys?  It's 6:15p here and I think I deserve another G&T-it was so refreshing yesterday! Over and out. D1 Oh, SIS Kimberly-I finally broke down and downloaded the Sheryl Crow cd, Detours, from iTunes.  I've been listening to it all day and love it!  Now I want to go to her concert!",

So, SIS Kimberly is back from her cation!  I did not have to look carefully at all to see your duck fuzz.  Lookin' good, girl!  And I'm with Carol, I think you might be related to that gal with you in the photo... A babydoc!  Good for you!  Everyone deserves one at some point.  Myofacial release?  Is that when he presses on your shoulder hard to stretch the chest wall muscle to get your shoulders back where they belong?  That's what my rotator gal is doing to me and she has me pounding my fist on the table when she does it (she says most people scream when she does it, so I'm feeling like a pain stud here).  I'm not getting heat or stim, yet, but we'll see.  So far only manual manipulation.  It's weird, though, because of the le, my legu is in the room while I'm getting worked over and they take turns on me.  My legu doesn't want the pain from the rotator gal to cause any swelling which can lead to le issues, so in between the painful parts, I get a MLD massage!  Not a bad deal (and who doesn't like being the center of attention?). Agreed, just say NO to the HOA.  You're absolutely right that those folks get going on the power trip of being on the HOA board.  Remember, they shit just like everyone else. Yay Carol!!  Its summer in the PNW!  And you're back at your yacht club chillaxin' and enjoying a drink with your neighbors-seems almost normal! (Don't be intimidated by SIS Kim's rhymes-just enjoy her talent and know the rest of us do find you slightly educated.)  ;) The thought of someone hurling nearby sends my gag reflex into a frenzy.  Glad it wasn't me sitting next to her! I spy with my little eye, duck fuzz on Paula, too!  Umm.  Pinot Grigio sounds good to me.  I think we have mostly Chardonnay in our wine cellar (okay, it's a wine rack, but cellar sounds better).  Maybe I need to pick something else up. My money is on the drugs causing dh's fatigue.  Remember how tired we all felt during tx?  I'm going with the glass half full.  Fingers remain crossed. You hit the jackpot, Julie, with puppies that sleep through the night.  I remember I told our dog that if she didn't sleep through the night one night after we'd had her for 2 months, that I'd send her back.  Lo and behold, she's slept through the night ever since (she's more than 9 years old now). Hey, don't get me wrong, I don't like to clean, either.  I just like how everything is after it's clean! I'm all for sharing addresses, but not posting them here on the thread (heck, I haven't even given out my real name here, yet!), maybe via PM or something secure. Dd just got up and she has an 8 hour workday at the toy store today, so I'll go off and spend a little time with my baby. Happy b-day, SIS Kimberly!!! D1",

Deb--FABO news on the Arimidex!  It did seem odd that they were going to recommend it to you, so I'm glad you were following up with your doc.  The neuropathy will pass (at least mine is).  It just takes for bloody ever!  Try to be patient.  MLD (manual lymph drainage) massages are great and really help with the swelling.  When you get to your le specialist he/she should teach you how to do it to yourself.  I pretty much suck at self-MLD, but perform what I call fake MLD.  It's better than nothing.  But getting the real McCoy really does help.  Now, go hop on that tm! CathyCA--so you survived the car buying experience.  And only 2 hours!  Whew!  Ds is going to have unrealistic expectations of how long it really does take to negotiate a car at that rate!  (Yes, cleaning out the meat drawer counts as cleaning the fridge.) Thanks for the travelogue, SIS Kimberly.  I will look forward to tomorrow's installment.  You and sis look great in your pic.  And you were in first class AND won $50 in Vegas?!  The stars were aligned for you, my friend.  Nice to have you back. SuePeet--Gosh, I'm sorry to hear you're having swelling issues.  I don't remember that any of the Jewels had what you described, but if I'm wrong, I'm sure someone will step in and correct me.  I think you're smart to continue pointing it out to your med team until someone can give you an explanation for it.  Since I'm not a doctor (I just watch them on TV), I hesitate to give you any advice on the chance that I inadvertently misinform you.  Hang in there and hopefully it will be explained and resolved soon. Okay, I'm off to make dinner.  Green Thai Curry Chicken over whole wheat couscous and sweet potatoes.  Yum. D1 (You know, I think I'll clean the stove--natch--and run the oven cleaner tomorrow.  That would clean up the entire kitchen!!!  OMG, I get chills just thinking about it!)",

Sorry I've been MIA this week.  My sister arrived Tuesday evening, and I spent all day Tuesday preparing for her visit.  On Wednesday I tagged along on their sightseeing trip to Mt. Vernon (George Washington's estate on the Potomac River).  They've made some changes to the estate (added an interpretive center and restaurant), so I wanted to see it.  The museum and movie they added are really quite good (although I left with the impression that GW was the only truly Great American ever to walk this soil!  Such propaganda!).  But, it was an absolutely beautiful day and the estate is situated on the banks of the Potomac perfectly-I was ready to move in! Yesterday, I sent my sis and her family off on the Metro (our subway system) to tour things downtown while I exercised, laundered, vacuumed, prepped for dinner and had my myofacial and le txs.  The myofacial gal is really making some progress with me.  I'm excited that I can pull my car door shut again without having to get out of the car.  After she's done hurting me, my legu steps in and gives me my MLD massage (still making me drool just a little bit). Today we don't have any plans till around 6p when I'm thinking we're going to Metro to the stop near the Iwo Jima Memorial and watch the fireworks from the Virginia side this year.  That's a cool spot because the Lincoln  Memorial, Washington Monument and the Capitol building all \"line up\" in your line of vision and it's a WAY cool backdrop for the fireworks.  My bil is a professional photographer, so I'm thinking he'll get a kick out of that. Okay, let me head over to the thread and see what you guys are up to... \"Too Blessed to be Stressed?\"  I love it!  It's a good reminder to all of us to take a chill pill-I VERY frequently forget to take one...  (SIS Kimberly, you can get the Thai Green Curry simmer sauce at Trader Joe's-I totally cheat on that meal.) Good catch on the infiltrating IV, KathyL, I hope SuePeet gets it straightened out.  (I did get the oven and stove to match the fridge, but they're already getting messed up again with all the people here-oh well, they looked sublime for a good 4 hours!) Carol, oh lol, a \"two-holer\" hotel room.  You can always crack me up. Oh, and don't sweat the housecleaning-I never really notice other people's cleanliness (unless it's egregiously bad).  I just like how I feel when my house is clean. Didn't have a port, Carol, I mainlined my chemo via IV, so I can't help you there.  Hope you got some answers (and your arsenal to deal with your insurance co., what a pain).  I'll read on and see... CathyCA-what a great idea to buy the car through Costco.  I would've never thought of that.  I'm going to mention it to dh when we're ready.  Oh, and I'm joining the chorus on the endless appointments.  I was just looking at my calendar for next week and see that I have 6 medical appointments!  Will this ever end????? Sherry-thanks for taking the time to share your PICC line experience with SuePeet.  I think you may be the only one of the Jewels that had a PICC line.  Hmmm.  I haven't felt the food cravings you describe while on the Tamox.  But I've been obsessed with losing my post dx weight that I've all but stopped eating anything other than what's on my plate at a meal.  (Sadly, still drinking-particularly with my sis in town-so the calorie intake is undoubtedly still too high.)  Hope you're able to discipline yourself to meet your weight goal.  Keep up the walking-it can only help. You make me smile, Deb, the Race as 50 miles??!!  You won't even notice your Race after you \"train\" on the new tm.  Sounds cool (oh, and they're always bigger at home!).  Hope you managed to catch something good for dinner! Oh Julie.  Isn't that always the way?  Just as soon as you start breaking your arm patting yourself on the back, the migraines come back.  I hope its short lived for you this go.  I'll read on and see... You must have your own power washer, Julie, since you're out doing it so often.  We rent one and I think that's why it doesn't get done as often as it should around here.  I was just trying to \"sweep\" moss off the patio before my sis came in! I hope you have a good cation to Wisconsin.  Funny, the sis that's visiting me right now lives in WI! Oh Carol, you remind me.  My gyn did some bloodwork last week and I stopped by on Tuesday when I was between p/t appointments and got my results.  He said everything looked good, except my platelet counts.  I have to go back in 3 months and have it done again to be sure.  My cholesterol was higher than last time, but was only 161, so I'm happy with that.  I tried to get the Tamox metabolism test, but my onc said it wasn't necessary and would be an insurance issue, so I didn't get that one.  I hope your insurance comes through for you. Oh yeah, got the shrub trimmed.  Wish those guys were in my neighborhood-I have a mountain laurel growing at the corner of my house that was only supposed to be 8 ft. tall, but it seems to be really happy and is more than 16 ft tall now and gets in to the gutter.  We've tried to tame it over the years, but it's really out of control! Goodness SIS Kim, your Tuesday sounds busier than mine and you still found time to post.  I feel like such a weenie!  Sounds like your friend's mom dodged a bullet as far as mets go.  Whew!  I hope she is as successful in the rest of her tx and is back in the saddle in no time.  And the luck continues-first class, $50 and Sidney Portier's sig!!!!  You go, girl! Paula, keep kicking back.  I think this is just what the doctor ordered.  (Thank goodness dh bounced back from his virus!) No injuries from the fender bender, KathyL?  That's such a PITA (particularly for your car).  At least it sounds like you won't have to figure out logistics while your car is in the shop-I hate that. Hey Carla-FAB news on the cyst and tumor shrinkage!!!!  Hip hooray!!!  Keep celebrating and live life. Ooh, I'm wincing at your tightness after tanning session #8, Carol.  Good thing you get today off.  A three-day weekend will give your skin a little extra healing time.  Keep buttering. Joan, that dog is TOO CUTE!!!  Like I said to Julie, I'm glad the training period is behind me, but you guys sure have cute dogs.  Almost makes me miss the puppy years-almost. Another new puppy for Deb!  What's going on around here??? Julie, I can totally relate to the selfish side of wishing your kids don't get \"picked.\"  I've been there myself many a time. Sorry, only made it through Julie's post before my sis got up, so I'll have to pick up from there later. Have a great 4th, you guys!!! D1",

Not much on the agenda today.  I'm trying to find some sports bras I can wear on my vaca that will offer the compression I need in my pit area so I can wash my \"garment\" out some days on the road (I won't have access to the washing machine, so I have to get creative here or stink out my family on vaca).  I'm afraid I'm going to run up the national debt trying out all these different styles.  Today I'm trying a number made by the Moving Comfort folks.  It comes up high under my arm, has some padding over my boobs which evens out my lopsidedness (and camouflages my \"cold\" moments), and best of all, doesn't have those thick sports bra straps that would be exposed by the necklines of my shirts.  I also ordered a surgical garment bra that looks a bit nicer than my garment.  Hopefully it will come in soon so I can check it out before we leave.  Where are my lacy bras?????   Waaaa!!!  LE sucks. Well, dd is ready to head off to the gym.  We've been going together this week and I'm really liking that. Later. D1",

Nats game yesterday was great.  My dh's firm has 2 sets of 4 tix in the new ballpark-cheap seats and the really, really pricey ones.  My dh bought the cheap seats (that set us back $120-is that really so cheap???), but the office administrator gave him the good seats since no one else bought them (these tix are $300 EACH and come with access to an air-conditioned area AND $35 credit for food and drink!).  May I say WOW!  The stadium is beautiful (I hadn't been to the new stadium before) and access to the a/c was sublime.  The day was hot and muggy (particularly when you're wearing a corset and rubber on your arm), but we would sit outside for 2-3 innings and then head indoors for an inning and have a bottle of water and some ice cream.  Of course, the Nats suck (last place right now in all of MLB-not even the Mariners can go that low), but it was a great day. So Kris, sounds like you're still dealing with the neuropathy.  I had tingling for about 6 weeks after I finished chemo.  It did go away, so keep the faith.  The problem with finishing chemo is that you lose your patience for things \"se.\"  Try to keep your focus forward and your se's will begin to abate before you know it.  And then, you'll forget how awful they were (kinda like childbirth, IMO). Carol, your Saturday sounds like it was crazy/sick!  Hope you got some time to sit and relax.  Did the pancake heal up some over the weekend?  Hope so.  I remember the first Monday I woke up and realized that my field was still red from the Friday before-that was the week I knew I was in for it!  But I kept up the hydration/lubrication/exercise and was okay.  You will be too. Oh, LWDana.  Girl, don't you have enough going on?  Try to keep everything in perspective as you embark on this new adventure.  Keep your faith and stay strong.  You can do this. I am LOVING the baby pix, Diana!  She truly is an angel. Happy anniversary, KathyL!  The dinner sounds good.  I'm with you on the blue crabs-tasty, but too much work for so little payoff.  (Although it's a fun meal when you cover the table with newspaper and everyone is hammering away!)  But a king crab (or Dungeness)-now that's a crab!  Do you ever watch \"Deadliest Catch\" on the Discovery Channel?  We're hooked on it (no pun intended-although it's a good one).  It's all about the crabbing industry in the PNW.  Makes you appreciate how hard it is to get those critters on the table.  I'll bet the ds would LOVE it. CHJ-WooHoo on finishing up the rads!  I didn't have a port, so I can't help there, but I'm happy to hear another one of us is putting rads behind her! Hey Patty!  Sorry Denise is having such a hard time adjusting to her new reality.  Remember, it takes some of us longer than others to go through the 12 step process of acceptance.  Whether or not her doc suggests (or she accepts the suggestion) chemo, know that her journey has been difficult for her and that she will do the right thing for her in the end.  Try not (you'll see I said \"try\") to compare your journeys as we are all different.  You're doing the right thing for you and trust she will eventually do the right thing for her.  Oh, and always vent here.  ;) On the vision thing-my eyes have taken a real beating through this.  I haven't worn my contacts since the first of the year-after my first chemo.  I hate glasses.  And I've gone through so many rx changes that my sunglasses and regular glasses are two different strengths and give me nausea whenever I switch them out (where's my compazine?).  I actually think I'm going to break down and get my regular specs redone this week so I can see on vaca-life's too short, ya know what I mean? Sista!  Good to hear from you!  Sounds like the MRI thing is confusing.  I know they find all kinds of things that aren't significant.  I think that's why my own surgeon is hesitant to order them for me.  But I think if you trust your surgeon and she's been doing right by you so far, you need to continue to trust.  If you feel really shaky about it-take your films (MRI, mammo and ultrasound-the whole shootin' match) to someone else to read them.  You can start rads today and still get a second opinion later this week.  Important thing is your peace of mind and if you want a second opinion, I think your surgeon will be glad you got one so you can be peaceful. So the vet's office just called.  You all may recall that I was taking my dog in to have her teeth cleaned and was pretty wrapped about it.  Well, turns out she needs to have two teeth pulled.  A cracked molar in the back and a broken canine tooth (what kind of mother am I that I never noticed it?).  I'm really upset for my poor baby.  The new estimate for all of this is $620!!!!  To all you new dog owners-these lovable fur balls are mighty expensive...  I just hope she comes through okay.  This Friday is her 9th anniversary with us. Oh, and speaking of anniversaries, my 26th wedding anniversary is this Thursday and we're taking the girls out to dinner.  It's not a fancy restaurant, but I plan on dressing up.  I'm even going to wear a real bra and no sleeve-a celebration!!!!  Now I just have to figure out how to get some spark back into this relationship.  We've fallen into the \"best friends\" trap following a difficult patch and we really need to get more going on.  It took us almost 4 years to get past our rough spot, so I guess I should be patient, but for some reason, the bc has made me want to rush things a little.  Whoever said time heals all wounds should be shot. Okay, I'm off to wring my hangs over my dog. D1",

Wasn't Julie's surgery yesty?  I was thinking about her all day-if I got the day wrong, I hope you got my good vibes!  I'll read the posts, I'll bet someone remembers... Pressure from CathyCA to give a full cation report!  I'll do my best to scout Croatia for you.  One thing I think you'll miss is our hotel in Korkula.  Dh told me today that he inadvertently booked the wrong place and the one we're in has no a/c!  He didn't want to try to negotiate the language barrier to change it, so we're going to suck it up.  Hopefully there will be a cool breeze and we can open the windows those two nights! Clearly Julie's surgery is this week-that crazy girl is out playing with her power washer again! Okay, there's Carol mentioning the Tuesday surgery.  We're all thinking about you, Julie.  Oh, and I second Carol's sentiment about your ds thinking of someone other than himself.  A rare occurrence in a teen, make no mistake. KathyL, you gotta like a destination where all you do is relax.  I talked to the dh about my anniversary and suggested that we drink the bottle of champagne we got for my final rad session, but never consumed.  I can't believe we've been cancer survivors for a year! SIS Kimberly-I'll be gone by the time you get back from Ashland.  Hope you're enjoying your time away before school begins.  I'll be thinking about you and Carol kicking back and admiring your fence while I'm dodging bombs in Istanbul!  (What are we thinking???) Sherry-Whew!  This wedding stuff sounds more stressful than getting the kids into college!  Something to look forward to!  I'm glad you're not wearing black to the wedding, too.  Black is not a wedding color, imo.  I know you're going to be just radiant.  When is the day again?  I'll probably be on my trip (I seem to be missing a lot of stuff around here while I'm on cation). LOL at the washcloth story!  I wouldn't have fessed up, either. A honeymoon in Traverse City!  Oh my.  That's such a beautiful place.  I hope they have a wonderful time. Hip hooray that Julie came through surgery okay!  I'll bet those girls are going to be real beauties!  Listen to yourself and lay low-no powerwashing. Hey Paula, hope the conference is going okay.  I was sorry to read about dh's setback over the weekend an d understand how you must've felt to leave for your conference.  You left him in good hands, though.  You may not return till after I leave on Friday, so please take care getting back and forth to Duke.  I'll continue to send my very best thoughts to you and Ed. Carol-were you able to put your reservations on the table with the onc?  Did he/she offer any alternatives?  Or are you satisfied that this is the best approach for you right now?  Gosh, I hope they can use your port for the Zometa-I can totally relate to the needle thing. Speaking of needles, I agreed to have the BRCA testing done, but I told them I wanted to do the blood draw at a time I'll be giving blood anyway.  They were very accommodating, so I'll do the draw at my next onc appointment in early September.  They all have a note on my chart that says I'm afraid of needles, so they bring it up before I have to! How do you keep up with yourself, Kathy?  You make my head spin.  I think you really need your chillaxin at the beach-it can't come too soon for you! Well, I'm going to get back to my cation preps.  College girl had her tetanus updated today, so I'm breathing a sigh of relief over that.  I packed the first aid kit and it's overflowing with remedies for tummy distress!  I'm something of an expert on those remedies, now!!!  ;) Later.

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2008 07:53AM Determined1 wrote: Stopped in this morning to see if anyone was around and was glad to see the post from PALady!  I can't believe you mentioned your eyebrows.  For the past couple of days I've been examining mine thinking they were thinning again.  I remember seeing somewhere that the Tamox could cause hair thinning and I've been watching my head like a hawk.  My head hair growth seems to have slowed (although my hairdresser says it's a lot better than it was 5 weeks ago when I saw her last), and my eyebrows are definitely thinning.  All I have to say about that is WTF?!  Amazingly, pubic and leg hair seems to be thriving in their post-chemo state... Allegheny is one of those colleges mentioned in the book, \"40 schools that will change your life.\"  I went to one of the 40 schools myself--Kalamazoo College in Michigan--and will say they really do change your life.  And 30 minutes from home is schweet!  We thought we were getting off easy when college girl ended up 2 hours away, but 30 minutes is better.  Unfortunately, dd has honed in on Vassar, which is a 5 hour trip...  (Good news is that Amtrak runs from DC to Poughkeepsie, so we can tell her to train home, rather than driving all the time.)  I've been really proud of dd this week.  She has been working on her app to Vassar.  I think she has everything on the common app (soon you'll know what this is if you don't already) completed except for the main essay and the essay about one of her activities.  She's done with the Vassar supplemental--including the essays.  Lucky for her, the essays are the fun part because she loves to write (and she's good at it, too).  So I'm thinking she'll be done with that application before school starts in September!  She's applying early decision to Vassar to try to improve her chances of getting in.  I sure hope she's what they're looking for, as she's really hung herself out there with her essays and this kid doesn't expose herself to others often. Oh, and in all of my research about the college app process, your ds would be wise to bring athletics (or acting, or something other than just good grades and test scores) to the table.  These admissions officers are looking for something that makes a kid different (oh, and they LOVE community service.  In fact, Allegheny highlighted college girl's volunteer work in their acceptance letter).  We're trying to convince dd to talk to the basketball coach at Vassar (the team really sucks, so it's highly likely that our kid would make this team).  Our thinking is that you can always decide once you get there that you don't want to play ball, but it will help you get in (dh inadvertently learned that was so when he went to college to play basketball and then panicked and never went out for it--since it was a DIII school, there was no money involved, so what could they do?).  Anyway, get ds off to the soup kitchen for about 10 hours this summer so he can put volunteer work on his app! Have a great time in NC (why didn't either of my girls look at NC schools????), its a pretty state.  And take care of that nagging pain. Oh, I forgot to pack my slicker--better go grab it now while I'm thinking of it! D1",

      "Content": "Aug 17, 2008 12:50PM Determined1 wrote: I'm baaaaack!!!! Three things come to mind to describe the cation:  hot, expensive, and good people. We started in Dubrovnik, Croatia (southern, coastal city).  Matt Lauer was there for one of his \"Where in the World\" segments a couple of years ago.  The old town is one of those walled cities.  It's all marble (even the streets!) and no cars or bikes are allowed in.  The sun was blinding off the white marble, but it was beautiful.  We strolled the narrow streets and shopped, visited the church (just okay) and the monastery (quite nice).  And of course, we ate.  The cuisine is much like that of Tuscany, but features a lot of seafood.  It was outstanding.  We stayed just outside of the historic district, but could easily walk in.  One day we took a boat tour of the harbor (mostly to see the city from a different angle), and were so relieved to find a tour offered in English.  Well, we and one other Italian couple (who spoke no English) were the only passengers.  We were wondering how on earth the tour was going to go when it clearly needed to be in English and Italian, but then discovered that our captain merely drove us around the bay (passing a nudist area that got our attention) without any narration at all!  I'm sure the guy who booked the boat told the other couple that the tour was in Italian!  We also walked around the entire city on the top of the wall-it was really a nice place.  Not much to do there for more than 2 days, but we were happy. Then off to catch the bus to start our journey to Hvar, the Riviera of Croatia.  The most interesting part of the bus trip was the 10km we spent in Bosnia.  Part of the settlement when they divided up these countries was that Bosnia/Herzegovia got some coastal land, so we had to pass through immigration to gain access for that 10km.  Once we got off the bus, we caught a ferry over to Hvar.  Hvar was very small and clearly a playground for the 20-30 year old crowd.  Everyone was half-dressed and milled about the town square parading their tightly toned bods.  Our hotel was on the edge of town (a 20 minute walk to the center of town), so we spent the better part of the two days we were there at our hotel in the morning, then walked in to town just before the 6p ferry arrived and then claimed a table on the square and sat and drank beer and people watched.  While Hvar is the \"Riviera\" it didn't have a sandy beach.  All of the \"beaches\" were rocky cliffs that dropped into the Adriatic Sea.  The water was really clear, but was easily 10-15 feet deep when you jumped in.  When you knew what to look for, you realized that there were ladders installed all over the place to get out of the water.  It was heavenly.  Although (avert your eyes KathyL) I did manage to get a little pink... After Hvar, another ferry ride took us to Korcula.  A town even smaller than Hvar, but no traffic in the old part of the city.  Again, we trekked about window shopping and stopping for ice cream.  We had a fabulous meal in this town, eating out on the street while people passed us by.  One night we climbed into an old tower on the edge of town that had been converted into a bar and got a great view of the harbor.  The cool thing was, they didn't have the bar up on the top of the tower and the climb up there was difficult, so our drinks were served to us via pulleys from a level below.  So cool.  (We only had one drink, though, because we were all intimidated by the climb down when we were potentially tipsy.)  The only bad thing about this town was that our hotel had no a/c-hot, hot, hot! Then we were off to Turkey.  Wow.  This was a most amazing country.  The first four days were spent in Istanbul.  We stayed in the old \"Midnight Express\" prison which has been converted into a hotel.  I think it is the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in in my life.   It's easy to pass time in Istanbul.  We toured mosques (not as good as churches, imo), historic residences, cisterns, took a cruise along the Bosphorus, and found time every afternoon for some baklava and a drink.  We also shopped in the Spice Bazaar and the Grand Bazaar (that was really fun).  All of the people we met were incredibly nice and didn't hassle us much (except for the handful of young men who kept passing close by college girl so they could pat her on the bottom).  The fitness room at our hotel was really nice, so we exercised every afternoon and then I repaired to the soaking tub in our room for a soak and to watch the Olympics on the bathroom tv.  The food in Turkey was fabulous (reminiscent of Greek food).  We had some excellent meals there. After Istanbul, we flew a bit south to Izmir and then rented a car to drive to Ephesus to tramp through some of the best Roman ruins I have ever seen.  The frescoes were still easily visible on the walls and the mosaics on the floors were practically unblemished.  And these places dated several hundred years BC!  Our inn was in this teeny village and was truly an oasis in a farming village.  Once we passed through the doors to the courtyard, we found idyllic seating areas and a small infinity pool for soaking off the heat of the day.  They also cooked up a storm!  The last night we were there, there was an engagement party in the town square and our host took us to the party!  It was interesting as when we'd been moving about the town, we noticed that all we saw were men and boys, but at the party, the women and girls were out in high fashion!  (Turns out that the women in this area are well-protected by their menfolk and don't come out unless there's a good reason.) In all, we learned a lot (mostly that these people are some of the most welcoming on earth), and saw so much history, I haven't even been able to process it, yet.  For now, I'm struggling with jet lag and hoping I'll adjust to this time zone real soon. I really need a nap about now, so I'll read through the thread later (or tomorrow). I hope everyone is okay.  I thought about all of you a lot (Carol finishing up rads, LJ in rads, Julie with her new girls, KathyL celebrating her \"anniversary,\" Paula and Ed, Sherry getting ready for the wedding, to name a few of my more conscious thoughts).  I'm eager to catch up.  (Carol and Kimberly, give a toast when you open your wine today-it's MY \"anniversary\" today.)

Not surprisingly, SIS Kimberly is getting things together for her year.  Yeah, I think I'll look in to something part-time.  I don't think I'm going to resurrect my business (I have a small business that manages trade associations, but I let all of my clients go and I don't really want to put the energy in to making that work again.  I did it for 15 years and that's good enough for me.).  Now I have to find something else that floats my boat.  I'll probably be a crappy employee as I'm accustomed to calling my own shots, but I'll give it a try. Sherry, I thought about you a lot yesterday.  I hope the wedding was wonderful.  I am back on the Tamox and have the now familiar muscle cramps in my legs again and almost right away I could tell the feeling that I could cry at the drop of a hat was back.  I continued to have hot flashes on cation, but there are more of them with Tamox.  Unfortunately, I'm not getting more sympathy from my family, so no one really thinks this is an added se.  I'm hoping the eyebrows I grew while I was taking my break will stick around, but we'll see... Enjoy your pal, SIS Kimberly.  How funny that he's a lobbyist from DC-so is my dh!  Small world. Hey Paula, if you think you'll get a break in your schedule when you're in DC, let me know.  I'd certainly drive in to the District to meet you and grab a cup of coffee or something...  (It's kinda like speed.) Oh man, Carol, I'm sorry that ds did the tat without permission (and not at a tat shop, yuck).  I know it doesn't help, but he's really at an age where he's trying so hard to show his independence from you and it really becomes a tug of war sometimes.  Particularly when they get all bullheaded one day and then they call you \"Mommy\" the next.  You will get through this, it is part of the passage to becoming an adult.  In fact, if he didn't do this, there would be something wrong.  It's a really hateful, hurtful part of the journey, but it is part of it.  Hang in there. How's the Femara going? Oh the Olympic coverage.  It was great.  Particularly for the couple of days that we listened to the action in Armenian!  It was refreshing to see a broader scope of athletes, not just those contests with the USA in them.  And we didn't have to suffer through the \"up close and personal\" interludes.  But it was strange to watch some of the longer contests (like soccer matches or marathon runs) from start to finish!  At least everyone was watching Michael Phelps, so we did get to see him.  I cannot imagine the discipline it would take to be able to qualify for and then win 8 events in a week.  Simply amazing. Okay, I should get ready for our jaunt.  I'll catch up with everyone on Wednesday. D1",

I enjoyed the call bunches and bunches, Carol.  Fortunately, there were no prerequisites for parenting or I'd have no kids at all!  But we all do the best we can and hey, we turned out okay so I always figured, how badly could I do???  Anyway, we luckily get our own chance to screw our kids up and some of us take that challenge seriously!  (Fortunately, my kids are turning out okay despite my best effort...) Hope the walking is okay with the back in recovery.  Don't forget, you do need to pamper yourself a little bit for a week or so.  And I'm always happy to learn of a new use for duct tape.  I have a buttload of it in my basement for the next time we're attacked by terrorists (like duct tape is going to do any good...). Joan, I'm happy to hear about your hatless state.  Your hair is beautiful.  Please don't take your mom's criticism seriously.  We all had different hair before chemo and we need to embrace the opportunity to try this new hair for a while.  If we don't like it, well, hair grows (unless you're taking Tamoxifen, damn drug).  Your mom will adjust and with time you'll settle on a \u2018do.  Who knows, some of us may stick to the short hair!  (If my family didn't keep telling me that I look like my mom, I'd most def keep this short hair.) Jenn, I'm so sorry about your knees and bronchitis.  Seems like you can't get a break.  We miss you.  Please try not to go to the dark place.  Come and complain to us instead.  Read up, laugh, and rejoin us. Hey Paula, good to hear from you!  Glad the first week went well.  Luckily you get a short week next week to ease you into the routine.  I have to say, isn't \"relax and smell the roses\" the same thing as \"chill and sip the vino?\"  ;) Hope the dh is doing okay. Well, the family is about to belly up to a movie, so I'm going to join them.  Something on demand, so there is much discussion over what to watch.  I figure if I stall here long enough, they'll decide and then it will be okay if I disappear off to bed an hour in to it as it will be one I did not choose.  How's that for master manipulation?? We're off to visit college girl tomorrow to take her to dinner.  It seems she thinks the next several weeks will be taken up with \"rushing,\" so we have to visit her now.  Since I was not in to the Greek thing when I was in college, this is all new to me.  I'll be interested to see if it lasts with her. Anyhoo, hope to stop in on Monday.  Happy Labor Day! D1",

We visited college girl yesterday and took her to dinner.  She must have thanked us 20 times for coming.  It made us all feel good about making the effort.  She's excited/nervous about rushing this week.  I don't know if I'da gone through all of that if my school had offered a Greek life (I went to this academically snobby school that told us Greek life would inhibit academic excellence).  It sounds a lot like high school where you're being judged and chosen based on some pretty flimsy evidence.  To each their own, I guess. I am happy that she's really putting forth the effort in her classes this first week in.  She was quite critical of the freshman living in her dorm who were going out every night drinking themselves sick.  (Was that her last year????)  Apparently, there's a girl on her floor who managed to sleep with 5 different boys over a 4 day period and is crowing about it.  College girl just shakes her head in disgust and says, \"Freshmen.\"  Ahh, the benefit of experience. Today dh and dd and I are headed off to the gym at dh's office (my community center gym is closed today).  Then the two of them are going off to play frisbee golf at a local course while I walk the dog or something equally scintillating.  Dinner tonight at the in-laws to end summer.  Sounds good to me. Oh, and I am the superior mother.  I managed to get dd in to that AP Environmental Science class AND reorged her schedule so she could have lunch period with her best pals.  So the kid has 5 AP classes this year, and is yearbook editor in a 6th class.  She'll probably breathe a sigh of relief when she hits the door of her government class--the only \"regular\" class she's taking.  She's uber excited about being a senior, so I hope this year meets her expectations. Onward! D1",

I read with a HUGE smile and a big sigh that Carol's freckle is b9!!!!  Makes me want to send out a happy dance!  (Where's Julie when you need her?)  Great news, Carol. Hope the PTO meeting went okay, KathyL.  I never did that as I found it all so political and I mostly wanted to help the kids.  So I was a Girl Scout leader for both of my girls' troops (for about 6 years I had 2 troops at once), I volunteered once a week in the elementary computer lab for an hour (did that for 7 years total!), and helped with field trips when my schedule would allow it.  Once the kids got to middle school I only had scouts and helping my dh with the rec league basketball teams he coached, and then along came high school and, poof!, they don't want you around anymore.  (I got by that one by being the Basketball Boosters president for the past 5 years!)  You'll find your niche and hopefully you'll have a lot of fun along the way. So happy you've ditched the wig.  And then to see Joan confirm her topless state in the very next post!  I think the Jewels are starting to ROAR!!!!! Hey, good luck with that obedience class, Joan.  If you're really well-behaved, maybe they'll throw a treat your way!  JK Carol, you have WAY more balls than I!  I can't believe you actually made it through the Lover's store.  I would have loved to be a fly on the wall for that one!  (Oh, and I'm with KathyL-I'm so honored that you would include the Jewels in your decorations for your tent.  Don't put any reference to me next to that Frisbee, okay????) So here's my latest homage to our sisterhood.  Yesterday my onc's office called to confirm my appointment for Monday.  I mentioned this to my dh and told him that normally those confirmation calls don't even get my attention, but I felt a huge knot in my stomach over that one.  His reply was, \"well, you gotta go.  It's just a doctor's appointment.\"  Humpf.  He doesn't get it.  I know all of you completely get the knot thing and it gives me strength to march in there on Monday knowing I have all of you by my side.  Thanks for being there. I can't believe it's already 3p!  Where did this day go???  Dd will be home from school in about 10 minutes.  Guess I should move on. D1",

Today started at the gym then a quick shower before p/t (she's still hurting me).  Then I ran off to have my hair colored again.   I needed to warm up the color for fall.  I LOVE it!  Not much of a cut, mostly shaping the hair along my neckline.  I look so hot!  Then I ran to the mall to meet a friend for lunch and then we giggled our way through the Clinique counter, buying some new makeup for fall since they were having one of their bonuses.  They talked me into trying a new eyeliner, so I'm kinda excited about that. Now I'm finishing my 4th load of laundry (I started it this morning when I got up) and have to put clean sheets on my bed.  (I love Friday nights when I have clean sheets!) Gosh, Julie, I sure hope your aches are muscle-related.  I wasn't around to see your sister's issues with her implants, but I sure don't want you to have any.  Glad you got out on your boat again.  I imagine the season for that will be winding down soon-bummer.  So, SIS Kimberly, what's the plan for the 15 lbs?  I still have 5 hanging around that I'd like to shake, so if you have a good idea, let me know.  It's really great how your onc is helping you avoid the hormone thing.  Mine told me that our body fat will also produce estrogen, so that's probably why yours suggested the weight loss.  Diet and exercise is good for all of us, so you can't be too upset with that rx! Wendy!  GREAT to hear from you!  I was just reading through our header this week and was wondering about some of the Jewels that don't post quite so often.  Thanks for checking in.  Even though it was challenging to have your mom and stepdad around as \"help,\" I'll bet you were glad to be able to spend the time with them.  Good luck with your alien removal and WoooHooo on your topless state! I think I'll give college girl a ringy dingy and see how rushing went last night.  She was SOOOO nervous! D1",

Speaking of dd, she's going to try to play basketball on her gimpy ankle today.  She sat out last week and her p/t suggested she try it now after 2 weeks of tx to see how it feels.  Course, her period started yesty and she had to miss work due to a head cold, so I'm not sure how well she'll play, but she needs to give some feedback to her therapist, so off we go.  Fortunately, there is a 3 week game break after this weekend for some unknown reason, so her ankle will get a break.  (Gosh, hope that doesn't turn out to be a bad pun.) Okay, I'm going to complain a little.  After much sleuthing, my p/t, legu, and I have discovered that wearing my big bra causes my back to ache all the time.  Turns out, now that I have more mobility in my arm (rotator cuff on the mend, thank you very much), the bra, in all of its compressive state, limits the mobility.  So I'm twisting my back somehow to get the new mobility back, causing the pain.  I, of course, suggested that I dump big bra.  That did not go over well-next thing I knew my legu was showing me photos of people who don't wear their compression garments and it was not pretty.  So I'm trying some stretching exercises to see if I can get some relief, but I think this is just make-work for now.  Hopefully, my gals will come up with something better soon.  It's always sumthin,' isn't it? Speaking of always sumthin,' SIS Kimberly, you seem to have a lot on your plate right now.  I haven't done jury duty, yet (knock wood), but you laid out your case very well.  I really hope everyone gets the help they need in that situation.  It sounds like there was a loud cry for it.  And your teacher peer-ugh.  What a mess.  I really hate hearing about that kind of thing.  I hope your school is recovering from the drama.  Did the massage help chase away the memories of the week??? Shoot, KathyL, when we paint, we repaint the walls white!  (Downside of marrying a Scandinavian.)  It really makes you feel fresh to get it done, though.  I'm trying to root around in our home files to see if I can find the manufacturer of my current tile, but so far I'm empty-handed.  I'd really like to stick with what I have cuz I still like it, but we'll see how it goes.  Hope you got some r&r in... Carol-Fabo pix!  And your trip report was very good, thanks.  I'm really sorry we've been missing each other.  Today is not great for me, but if you get a break at work tomorrow, give a call.  I don't have much on the agenda after about noon my time.  I was glad to see you're out golfing already-your recovery from the 3day must be complete-at least physically.  Naw, the shrimp dish didn't get me any action, but it was delish!  I did receive many compliments and he was impressed that I would go to so much trouble \"just for him.\"  Maybe it takes time... So, guess I should get out the paper.  I want to see how much money I'm losing and check on the political action (time for those Sunday talk shows!).  Later. D1",

So, CathyCA, our world traveler is home again.  What a wonderful trip you must have had!  I've always wanted to visit that part of the world-and hope that someday I get the chance.  I do agree that when things are so \"Americanized\" when you travel it's a bit jarring, but I guess that's American enterprise for you.  Nowhere is sacred.  Hope you got caught up on your chores and that the jet lag is giving you a break. Nice chat, Carol, as always.  I am lucky to count you as a friend. So I got the prelim results on my BRCA testing.  The first round, they only looked at the \"Jewish\" genes to see if there was a link there.  Nope.  All clean.  But since I'm only Jewish from my mom's side, we have agreed to look at the rest of the strand for any mutations.  I'm guessing that will come back negative, too.  I suppose my bc was just luck of the draw (what is it, 1 in 8 get bc?  I wonder who is in my \"7?\"). I'm working on my plans to go to Eleuthera (Bahamian out island) with my sister next month.  She's gotten approvals from the outreach organization for which she volunteers, so we're slated to work in two libraries this time.  No teaching, but we're going to set up libraries in two towns (there may be some computers to set up, too).  It'll be a lot of sorting through donated books and cataloguing and implementing some sort of tracking system for the librarians who will work there.  Hopefully, there will be a librarian for each location so my sister can train her/him.  My sis has already worked in one of the libraries and it has never opened, so we're going back to clean out the junk (probably has been used for storage since she was last there) and help them plan a grand opening so they have a goal to open their doors.  Once these places open up and people start using them, things seem to go better.  It's just getting the door open that's so darn hard.  Looks like I'll be gone the last 10 days of October for this adventure. Other than that, my mind is on my other sis today.  She's having the last of her tests done and will meet with her onc later today.  I think she'll know something by 7-8p my time (of course, it's back to school night for dd, so I won't be home to hear the news till after 9:30!). Speaking of back to school night, I'm really looking forward to it this year.  For one, it's my last one!  And secondly, dd will be making the presentation to the parents as the editor of the yearbook.  She's a little nervous, but has so much to do today, that she shouldn't have too much time to dwell on it.  I hope she speaks clearly... Other than that, I'm still hunting down compatible tiles for my bathroom renovation.  I managed to find the manufacturer of my tile and have learned that it has been discontinued.  So I'm going to call around a little today and see if I can't find some places that have some left over and will hopefully find enough for our project. All the news from here, ladies.  Have a good one. D1",

Heard back from my legu.  She said the benefits of a mammo outweigh the risks for me (um, and what benefits have I EVER received from a mammo?).  So I have to get up early enough to hop in my Flexitouch (yeah, weird name) before I go for the mammo and then use it again afterward (every time I use it, I'm immobilized for an hour!).  She also said to be sure to wear all of my compression 24/7 for a few days before and after.  I'm excited. CathyCa-thanks for the reminder on the sleeve when flying.  Actually, I have to wear the damn thing every single day, so I don't forget it as much.  The part I don't wear all the time is the gauntlet, so I have to be careful not to forget that when I fly!  I also have to wear chest compression when flying, but again, I wear that every day, too, so it's hard to forget. LOL on the hot water being ds' only issue!  That's very good news, indeed.  And I really like the whole parents' association idea.  It IS hard to know what's going on when your kid is not at home (heck, sometimes it's hard when they ARE at home!), so that feedback would be invaluable.  So glad ds is in a good place now.  I'm sure you are, too. Keep training for that 3day!  It's great that another Jewel is doing one this year.

Carol-good talking to ya yesty.  Boy, I hear you on the retirement from the govt.  My dh has 19 ½ years with the govt and has to go back for 6 months so we can get the retirement health care plan.  He's spent years fretting about when it will be best to do that and how, but we know it has to be done.  If he goes in for 5 ½ more years, he'll qualify for early retirement, so that could be good, too (although by the time he finishes the 5 ½ years, he'll be retirement age anyway...).  I'm hoping I can stay in retirement now... I gotta check out the links you, CathyCA and PALady have given us before we flip to a new page on our thread and I forget.  (I'm so outta sight, outta mind these days.) Sherry-Okay, your whole job situation is just sucking right now.  Who needs that much stress after the year you've had?  I really, really hope things straighten out to your benefit real soon.  Hang in there and vent here whenever (everyone needs an outlet).  Focus on the good news that the gall bladder was cancer-free!!!  Now that deserves a giant-sized WOOOOOHOOOOO!!!! I gotta get to gettin'.  Sorry for the brief post (brief for me). Wishing everyone a happy hump day and a good bc awareness month!  (How appropriate that I, a bc survivor, have my mammo this month...) D1",

Carol!  The pictures are amazing!  What a treasure!  I'm going to ask dh to scan it in so I can have them on my computer.  Thanks ever so much.  What a project! Hey Sherry, thanks for the computer suggestion.  My mom is using a friend's old one right now and may opt not to buy a new one at all.  I'm just waiting on her decision now.  How are you feeling? You know, Julie, I've had a few occasions when I couldn't get my computer to \u2018grant access' for my copy and paste post.  I haven't a clue what causes that to happen...  It's homecoming week here, too, and dd is dressing up every day for spirit.  Yesterday's get up was a hoot-plaid pj bottoms, tie-dyed t with a plaid (different plaid) flannel shirt over it, tie-dyed gyms socks pulled up over her pant bottoms, and a tie-dyed sweat band for her head.  She looked completely dorky and could not have been happier about it!  She's still negotiating which gang she'll hang with for dinner and then the dance on Saturday night, apparently, she has a couple of offers to consider (thank goodness we don't have the \"date\" thing going on in our high school-that was so traumatic for me). I'm so sorry the house thing is frustrating.  You're a better person than I if you can really \"go with the flow.\" And I love the Volley for the Cure.  How wonderful for you that one of the kids played in your honor.  You must've felt so good.  Our basketball coach tried to do some bc fundraising last season, but didn't quite have it together (having the girls shoot for the cure would've been a good idea...).  Maybe this year. So check out that picture of Julie and PALady!!!  Hot mamas!!!  PALady, what are you putting on your hair????  I need some of that!  I'm quite jealous that both of you have color to your hair (or are you guys cheating?).  The smiles are wonderful.  Thanks for sharing the picture. OMG, Sherry, you had me laughing with your comment about Julie and KathyL standing proud! SIS Kimberly!!!!  Actually, your weight progress sounds GREAT!  Keep up the good work (maybe I should put these crackers away-but they're whole grain, at least). Oh, no.  I just read about your twin sis.  She has her biopsy today.  I'm mustering all my best thoughts to send her way.  I sure hope she has her cape... The warranty on my mom's computer was only for one year, so she's SOL.  Like I said earlier, she may decide to limp through with her friend's old one for a while. Yeah, dh and I are kinda stuck.  Unfortunately, we had some issues before bc came along and have been working through them for something like 5 years now.  In all honesty, we still have a way to go on that score, so I shouldn't be too surprised at my situation.  I'm actually starting to think I may need to see a professional to get over this, but I really don't know where to turn, I'm tired of medical appointments and quite frankly, I'm not sure I could discuss this out loud.  Even though the bc has made me eager to put negatives out of my life, you can see that I still have some ground to cover here.  I'll get there. (What a Debbie Downer.  Sorry about that.) You mentioned the silicone pad-I think its working!  I can already move my arm better without it \u2018burning.'  I'm going to stick with it (so to speak) for a few weeks and see if I can't break down the giant wad of scar tissue in my armpit. Oh, and speaking of my giant wad of scar tissue, I had my mammo yesty.  All clear.  I talked to the tech and the mammo doc at length before agreeing to do it, just to allay my fears about aggravating my le.  They were very good about discussing the physiology of a mammogram and didn't make me feel funny about asking.  So then I go up to see my surgeon afterwards to have them read.  First thing he tells me is that mammos don't cause le.  Dolt.  (There's that word again, Carol.)  I know that.  I explained that I was concerned about aggravating the le I ALREADY have.  Pissed me off.  Anyway, he said he thinks part of my problem with the le could be tied to the scar tissue wad (isn't that HIS handiwork?) and as it breaks down over time, perhaps my le will improve.  I didn't even tell him about the silicone patch (you'd think he'd be suggesting it, but nooooooo).  I was happy to have a good report and booked on outta there.  I go back in 6 months for a left side mammo only.  Next up, MRI with my baby doc (rads doc) in November. Back to Kimberly's post.  I'm really excited for next Tuesday.  College girl is coming home this weekend and on Tuesday I'm going to take her to the courthouse so she can vote absentee in person.  She voted in the primaries, but this is her first general election.  We're both excited.  Maybe I should spring for lunch afterward... Good to hear from you, Joan!  You look GREAT in the picture!  Your hair has filled in a lot since I saw you at the end of August.  Sounds like you're out doing the fundraising walks this fall.  That's great.  Say hi to Lucy for me! Oh CathyCA, will you come and clean my house?  (And make those hors d'oeurves?) I've been so busy that I haven't kept the house up the way I like it.  I def want to get at the stove and sink and do some vacuuming before college girl comes home on Friday.  Luckily, I have a couple of days to accommodate my penchant for procrastination. You're way too dedicated to your golf game, Carol.  If the weather's not perfect, I'd bag it.  So does your Alaskan salmon come from Bristol Bay??? ;) I'm surprised to hear from you, KathyL!  I thought Wednesday was your day!  You sound really upbeat (busy, but upbeat).  It's great.  You should love being the classroom helper.  I did that (I ended up in the computer lab because that's where one of the early teachers needed the most help) the entire time my kids were in elementary school.  I really, really enjoyed it.  Speaking of enjoying things, Robin Roberts should be great.  If you get a chance to report on it, I think we'd all like it.  Fingers are crossed that your new nipple sticks with you.  My dh told me the other day that my lumpectomy scar is finally looking better.  He said it reminded him of a giant eyebrow over my nipple.  Whatever. Oh!  I'm at the end.  You guys are probably happy about that.  Okay, off to do my monthly accounting for my little company and maybe some laundry... D1",

Deb-It was SO good to see your post.  I'm happy that life is getting in the way of your time online with us!  Your walk was yesterday-hope the dogs aren't barking too much today.  Speaking of dogs, your puppy is looking good. I, too, had occasion to wear my Jewels FUBC t-shirt yesterday.  I attended a bc awareness conference at the hospital where my surgery was done.  It was interesting-particularly when they had a panel of 4 women describe their journey.  Even I was on the verge of tears!  I did realize a couple of things about myself there.  First, I want to try yoga.  They had a demo of seated yoga and I was really digging it.  Second, I'm going to really try to get a script from someone to get massage therapy through the wellness center at the hospital as their massage therapists are also trained to deal with le and will adjust their touch to the le side (I'd been told no real massage due to the le, so this could be just what I need).  Third, I'm going to try to make my mind more open to the idea of seeing a professional to get me over my hump.  Listening to the presentations yesterday, I think I might be allowing bc and my marriage situation put me in a state of depression.  Not sure (no doctor here-just see them on tv), but maybe, just maybe...  Now I have to figure out where to find a therapist and allow myself to talk out loud to someone about these things.  I'm really not excited about the prospect of more appointments, especially since I should be dropping two a week at the end of this month (the rotator cuff therapy) and I'm thinking about adding the massage therapy, but I'll think about it. (Not till after my trip!) Ugh, Julie, you have to wait till the end of the month?!  That sucks.  Glad you survived homecoming.  Our dance was held last night and dd is still in bed, so I don't know how it went.  But she looked really pretty.  College girl (who is a clothes horse) brought home a couple of dresses to loan her sis, so we didn't have to go out and get a new one.  College girl helped dd cover her backne and off she went.  She went with a really nice group of girls, so I'm sure there were lots of laughs.  I can't wait to hear the report.  Today dd is going to try playing basketball on her ankle again.  It's been 5 weeks since she's played, but her p/t seems to think she's ready to try it-not to mention the fortune in orthotics and braces she'll be wearing...  I just hope she plays well-she allows her performance on the court to color her outlook on the rest of the world. Hey SP!  Great gift idea!  I received a bookmark and a booklight to take on my trip.  Now I have to find just the right tome to break them in.  Thanks!!! Oh, and just an update on college girl.  She's blossoming in to a wonderful adult.  She's so much quicker to give a hug than she's ever been.  She has thought-out opinions of the world and can concisely share them.  And, she's beautiful.  I'm loving it.  Of course, she came home and announced that she's met her future husband (again!).  She's bumped in to this guy twice at school events and they're talking.  The other girls are jealous, so that's encouraging to college girl (we all know how girls are!).  There doesn't sound like much to work on, yet, but she's swooning and eager to get back to school to see if something works out.  It's fun to watch. That's about it here.  I think today is going to be go, go, go!  Guess I'd better get ready! D1",

Saw the radonc yesty (my baby doc) and he said my MRI was inconclusive.  When I pushed him, he used the word, \"unremarkable.\"  He said there's some stuff that pops up, but he's not concerned about it.  He's using this MRI as my new normal base and the next one in 6 months (!) will be the one he uses to monitor changes.  He said he'll follow me every 6 months for a couple of years.  Next time he wants MRI and mammo, so I'm going to do the mammo at Arl Hosp and carry it to G'town (where I'll do the MRI).  That way, I'm consistently having each of those scans done at the same place, creating a nice little portfolio for myself. Then I went down and parked myself in my onc's waiting area till I got me a script for massage therapy.  Apparently, there is no script for the head therapy, I just cold call therapists till I find one in my insurance network and clicks with me.  I did get the name of a woman at G'town, but I'm also putting out a few email feelers to people whom I trust in the Arlington Hospital system to see if I can find someone closer to me.  Guess the next step is to run the names by my insurance and begin scheduling consults with them. Aside from cleaning today, I'm going to head in to my closet to see if I can still fit into anything that resembles black tie apparel as the dh and I have a function to attend tomorrow night.  I think we're just going to fill the table, but whatever.  I haven't been to black tie stuff in ages (made the circuit during the Clinton years, if you can remember back that far), so I'm hoping something will fit and look somewhat fashionable.  We'll see. Speaking of the Clinton years-happy post election, everyone!  No matter how you voted, you have to admit, it's kinda heady to know we're sending an African American to the White House!  I sure hope he's up for the job. Julie, did some of those races turn out better for your dh?  I'm totally in to the political junkie thing myself.  You should have seen me racing around Eleuthera last week, trying to find a bar that would run the Obamamercial and keep their patrons quiet while I watched a little bit o' history being made. Weird about Ed's seizures, Paula.  Sounds like you could almost keep the calendar by them.  Well, here's hoping they're just part of his cycle and not anything new.  Please let us know what the bloodwork says. Yeah, we know Delaware, KathyL!!!  Do you think there's a chance your governor will appoint Joe's son, Beau, to the seat?  That would be very cool, indeed.  Hope the dd's party goes well this weekend.  I kinda miss those parties... LJ, as always, thanks for the link to the lifting.  I may print it out.  I still have to use my bands for another 8-10 weeks, but after that, I'm supposed to be able to introduce more free weights in to my workout.  This will be kinda new for me as I used machines before.  Hey, as long as I can do some weight-bearing stuff, I'm okay with it. So Carol, do you know where the life vests are on your ferry????  Hope you got there safely. Off to shower and get this show on the road today.  My big excitement is my hair appointment this afternoon! Onward. D1",

Speaking of Carol, you must be with your friend and her baby by now.  Sometimes medicine can be such a miracle, can't it?  How's the little one doing? So why is sex such a weapon, Carla?  That doesn't sound very fair for your dh to use it that way.  I'm glad you're able to articulate your emotions to him-that's a huge step.  Hang in there. LOL at the thought of you dealing with a poopy diaper, Carol!  I hope the baby behaved! I didn't think the mammo hurt that much, either, Norma.  Glad it came back clear, but even gladder that you stood up for yourself and got them to alternate with ultrasound.  I'm alternating with MRIs, despite the fact that my surgeon doesn't like them for the very reason you mentioned (the excessive false alarms).  I'm feeling pretty good about them for me, though, since it's my Georgetown team doing the MRIs and they look at the one I just had done as my new baseline and will look at new questionable areas from that.  (Oh, and my mammo report sounded just like yours, it didn't sound like the \"all clear\" to me, either, but I guess we have to hope these people know what they're doing.) Thanks for the head's up on the skin changes-it doesn't hurt to be reminded of such things every so often.  And I hear you on the doc's appts, but the ovary thing really does merit more checking... Quite the story on the heart palps in your son.  I hate it when our kids have to watch their bodies like that.  My college girl has acid reflux (she even takes daily meds for it) and is constantly having to be vigilant.  It sucks for them. Oh, to answer your question about my connection to Eleuthera.  My parents were both private pilots, so we traveled by plane a lot as kids.  One of the places we landed was Eleuthera.  Since we were unable to take off the same day we landed (my parents were only visually rated, so they couldn't fly over the water after dark), we ended up in one of the settlements on the island looking for lodging.  Well, this was truly an out-island at the time, so there were no rooms to rent.  We ended up being invited into a family home and the people living there became my \"relatives\" so to speak.  I spent a lot of my wonder years with these people and the other people in the settlement.  I even attended half of my 6th grade year in the school in the settlement (it was at this time I learned that my hair could not be plaited like the other girls'.  One of my early recollections of the differences in race...).  Long story short. OMG, Deb, LOL on your snappy repartee!!!! So college girl has made an appointment to call the dh and me tonight to share some news.  I'm a little nervous... Oh, and today I went in for my first massage therapy appointment.  I'm thinking I'm going to move in to their little clinic so I can get attention 24/7!  I was totally drooling!  I cannot wait to go back next Monday! I should see what else I need to do around here.  I bought some pansies for the front and need to plant some hyacinth bulbs first.  Perhaps I should bundle up and do that (I probably should have done it a few weeks ago, but I wasn't feeling it then). Till later. D1 Oh, what do you guys think of a license plate personalization that says \"DTRMD1\"?  My dh didn't get it, but I imagine you all will...  (The other idea I had is \"D WON\".)  Opinions?",

Paula, so glad to hear Ed is doing better.  You gotta like it when he can do some stuff around the house (and I know he does, too).  Cool beans on the new entertainment system and finding a home in the designated armoire.  It's so funny how it sometimes takes years for those things to finally work themselves out.  I hope you get lots of pleasure out of it. I'm going to pop the first Megace tonight.  My mood is better today (although I've found over the past 10 days or so that it's not very reliable).  I hear what you're saying KathyL, but the other options he gave me sounded worse than getting fat, so I'm going to try it for a month.  If I put on too much weight, it'll make me all anxious and depressed all over again, so I'm going to have to watch it, but I'm trying to recruit my family to help me from having seconds at meals or whatever and hopefully, I'll be able to be okay.  Anything's better than this downer I've been on...  (It's so weird, I didn't really think this blue period was chemically induced, but my onc said the effects of Tamox can be cumulative and for someone like me-very susceptible to drug reactions-he wasn't surprised.  It sure explains a lot.) So what can we do that's more central?  It should be a place with decent air service.  I mean, there's places like Austin, Denver, Phoenix, Santa Fe...  I haven't looked at any ticket prices, so I don't know, but they're central.  Oh, and there's always Chicago-although that might be expensive once we get there.  Any ideas? Thanks for the card, Carla.  I don't know how you have time to get them out. I have to refill my glass-I've been toasting Kris a bit much and I'm outta juice. Carol-MRI? D1",

I hear you on the one-horse town, CHJ.  The way I always run into someone I know around here makes me feel Arlington is smallish, but then you go in to the post office... Carol, dd even smiled at the thought of Portland being a quick 3 hour drive!  It's certainly a benefit to L&C, imo.  But I know she's going to give a couple of these tougher schools another try and see if her number comes up.  I just hope she can get money from them, too... I lol at the picture of the weiner in the snow!  My dog won't even go outside when there's snow on the ground.  Getting her to do business in the snow is such a headache. No, Paula, I'm darkening my hair gradually.  Before chemo my hair was dark auburn, but that color would look like shoe polish with such short hair, so I'm just a light to medium brown right now.  Of course, my natural color is no color at all, so I can do whatever I want!  ;) Gosh, Carol, I hope you got the snow day.  I, too, saw the bus crash and agree with Paula that something like that would have encouraged loss of bowel control! Well, hmmm, SISKimberly.  I find I have more Christmas spirit this year.  It was really hard for me last year as we headed to NYC for a weekend before Christmas and all I kept thinking was 5 more days till chemo, 4 more days till chemo.  It was kind of a dampener.  So I'm determined to be in the spirit this year.  BUT, my sister's tests all came back no cancer.  I think if I were in your shoes, I'd be looking at things a little differently.  I'm glad you shared your feelings with us, though.  And with the world-minded gift giving you did this year I don't think you can totally claim you're all Bah-humbug.  Just try to enjoy those in your company and don't add in the pressure of the holidays.  Friends are friends, year-round. I'll be curious to hear the final tx for SISKathleen in the rads dept.  I was really lucky with my rads as my excellent contours (I really need to remember to tell dh babydoc really said that) eliminated the need for a massive rad field.  That said, it seemed pretty big to me just the same.  Anyway, I hope the twinsis gets lucky, too. Not sure the dog biscuits keep others from sniffing her butt.  But certainly the fact that she sits down whenever someone tries to sniff her does! I like the extra credit offer to your students.  Unfortunately, many of them won't realize what a deal you offered till it's too late. Sounds like San Antonio and Las Vegas are generating some interest.  And the mid July dates.  More comments, anyone? Glad you got the card, Deb.  I really sent them more to make myself happy, truth be told.  Snow Patrol is awesome!  I included Chasing Cars on the cd I made for Julie when she was my SP (see Julie, you're WAY cool!).  I also like Spitting Games and particularly, Run, by Snow Patrol.  Maybe I'll head over to the iTunes store to pick some more Snow Patrol out with the gift card my SP sent to me... Gotta get to gettin'.  Dd has a game in less than an hour and I have to pick up the in-laws on the way. D1",

Paula, you made me lol at the thought of your family Christmas tradition of going to the doc's together! Yes, I got a cut and color.  The color is much closer to my before chemo color, but not quite as dark.  I'm actually thinking I may have my gal back off a bit next time-the dark color looks REALLY dark on such short hair.  Oh, and speaking of short hair, I'm back where I was in August.  It's super short again.  It's easy to take care of, but there's a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach that I don't want to be this short anymore.  We had to do it because the Tamox is causing some pretty serious hair-thinning for me (ok, tmi time, I have almost no pubic hair again!  Of course, it doesn't matter there, but hey...).  I'm just thinking I only need to get through 4 ½ more years with Tamox and then I can grow my hair again... Therese, how great to hear from you!  How coinky dinky that you and Julie both got nips and cars at the same time.  Is this some kind of guy fantasy that your dhs are living? Fingers are crossed that Kris gets her drains out for Christmas! Just had to rattle your cage, Carol.  Your snowgal is pretty darn good!  And a pinecone nip?  How creative (if not a little prickly)! Hey, loved the story about your ex-dh.  It speaks well for the future for your ds.  I'm really happy for all of you that it works out this way (oh, and kudos to Kent, who probably has the biggest adjustment to make in all of this).  (You can call and waste my tax dollars anytime-at least I'm getting some benefit from the use of that time!) Julie-sounds like your drugs are good.  Perhaps you should share so we can all glide through the holidays without a care in the world!  I hope you feel no pain and totally love the results when you finally get to see them. My college girl saw her internist last week for a checkup and one of the things she talked about were her migraines.  Turns out the doc told her to take the Relpax at the first sign of a migraine, but she can take another Relpax a couple of hours later if her symptoms aren't going away.   We're hopeful that will help her and the need to switch to a new drug will be alleviated.  It kills me to know she's having so much trouble with the migraines, 19 is too young to deal with that (or should I say 12 is too young, as that's how old she was when this all started). You know, I thought you were crazy to have a house full of hyped up boys, but I know exactly what you mean about making good for the time we were out of commission.  As hard as I tried to conduct business as usual last year, I know I failed miserably and find myself throwing everything I can at situations as they come up this year.  And I'm always bound and determined to enjoy every moment.  That's not always a bad thing. Oh, and ingraining the idea that do-overs and extra credit are not optional is a good thing.  Both of my girls were trained that way.  College girl even seeks out her profs to see if there is anything she can to do improve her grade-even when it's a solid grade.  A little over-achievement is a good characteristic, imo. Off to refill my coffee and wrap the last of the gifts. Merry Christmas, everyone! Fondly, D1",

My mom arrived Christmas day and then we invited her boyfriend (who lives in this area about half the year) and college girl's boyfriend over for dinner one night and played Guitar Hero till we were exhausted.  Lots of laughs. I did hear from my onc's office yesty.  Turns out they want me to stop taking the Megace immediately.  I sent an email to my onc's nurse before Christmas and she replied that the onc was out of the office till Jan. 5, so I didn't expect to hear from them, but she called first thing yesty morning saying she didn't like the se's I was describing in my email so she tracked him down on his cation and he said stop taking it.  I'm going to go a week without anything and then let them know how I'm doing.  I told the nurse that I'm worried about the depression from the Tamox and she said I should exercise.  I laughed.  I told her it may not look like I exercise, but I go to the gym 4x a week for at least an hour and a half each time.  She said, well, keep it up, exercise helps mental health.  So I'm thinking I've got another hurdle to clear before they realize that the Tamox is making me depressed and I'm already doing what I can to combat it.  Oh bother. So how was Santa to all of my friends? Looks like there's a birthday celebration at Paula's house today!  I hope you all have a happy, happy celebration this year! And a milestone birthday at SISKimberly's!  Happy belated to Greg! Go listen to some Snow Patrol, girl.  Start with Deb's suggestion, \"Chasing Cars\", and then try \"Run\".  I even used some of my SP's iTunes gift certif. the other day to pick up a few more Snow Patrol tunes. I like what you're saying about the appointment with the surgical OBGYN.  It sounds like he's in synch with you.  Get all of your questions answered honestly so you can make the best decision for you and go for it! Carol-Great gift from dd#1!  Now that's showing some support. And Kris got her drain pulled for Christmas!  Yay!  I'm sorry it was hurty coming out, but I'll bet you're way past that by now.  I hope you're healing up beautifully. Sherry, don't feel badly that you can't hang here 24/7.  You're supposed to get on with life.  We want to hear from you whenever you can spare the time, because we care, but don't let keeping in touch become a burden.  That's not the point, here.  I hope you're feeling better and taking some time for you over the holiday. Carol, your Christmas day sounds perfect.  There is nothing better than being surrounded by love, is there? Hey Tina!  How bout those Vikes?????? OMG, Norma!  Sounds like you had the Tamox scare, too!  How long had you been taking it?  My onc put me on a low dose aspirin every day from the get go with the Tamox, because I was all wrapped up about the blood clot thing since my dad had several strokes before eventually dying from heart attack/stroke.  My onc also has me stop taking Tamox a week before flying for more than 2 hours because of blood clot risk.  So I think your reaction must be more common than anyone cares to admit.  I'm just glad you were smart enough to make the call on your own.  Please let us know what happens at your appt on the 5th.  I'm curious to see what they recommend for you (I have a feeling I'm not far behind you...). Geez, Paula, I'm so impressed that you're already undecorating.  Dh tried to convince me to take down the outside lights yesterday while it was hovering near 70 degrees, but it just seems too soon for me.  I'll take them down on the next nice day. The 18th bday party sounds like fun.  A bit crazy, but fun.  It's hard to argue with a bunch of 18 year olds who want to hang out and play video games-they could be in to much worse things.  I'll be curious to see what you all decide to do. Julie, you must be in for your unveiling soon.  I can't wait to hear what you have to say about your new girls. CathyCA-you sound busy.  But working on the float must be a bit of a kick!  Dd and dh visited Pomona last Spring, while I was in rads.  She LOVED it.  I don't think she has a chance to get in there-too many kids with the same or better, but she has pulled the trigger on it.  I think she has applied to Pomona, Wesleyan (CT), Emerson (Boston), Occidental (LA), and Colorado College this round.  The next batch goes out for the Jan. 15 deadline... Sounds like there was some good eating out SISKimberly's way!  Glad you got your spirit on, my friend! Wow Carol, you were chatty!  But I feel kinda caught up with you.  Thanks.  (Oh, and don't feel bad about not wanting to undecorate, yet, as you can see, I'm with you on that one!). I think people will begin to stir around here soon, so I should move on.  My mom leaves today and I have appointments to see my rotator cuff gal for the next set of exercises and my legu to be measured for new compression garments!  Now I know how to have a good time!!!!

      "Content": "Jan 3, 2009 09:38AM Determined1 wrote: So we're firmly in to 2009!  Guess Kris was right, I just needed a good fuck to close out 2008!  (Thanks for the pm, Kris!) My bil and his partner stopped in DC yesterday unexpectedly and so dh and I had lunch with them.  It was the first time I've seen my bil since his bout with meningitis.  He says his only lingering issues seem to be balance problems and periodic anxiety attacks, for which he's got some meds.  We all agree that he was incredibly, incredibly lucky.  I told him about the crossed fingers here on the thread and he said to say \"thanks\" to the Jewels. So KathyL, what a holiday nightmare!  I agree with Carol, of all of us, you have the little ones who just don't understand that sometimes things need to be put on hold.  So there you were, soldiering on.  I'm so sorry you went through all of that, but happy that your tx did not include any surgery. And WTG on the MRI!!!  Don't worry about borrowing the BGP, they are certainly making the rounds!  I'm a little concerned that the elastic on the waistband is going to give with all of us yanking so hard... We all agree with you on Vassar-we think there's a reason.  We were all disappointed, but now we're waiting to see what the reason is... It's so good to see you back online, Patty!  Gluten-free?  It seems like that would severely limit your epicurean choices.  Is that a difficult lifestyle change?  How is going out?  (I always wonder how people with dietary limitations do in restaurant situations-it doesn't seem like our world is well-equipped to handle anyone with limitations/differences.)  Glad to hear Vettesis is doing okay. Hey, you need to talk to your onc about your blue feelings.  I'm still struggling with mine (they seemed to lighten with the Megace, but that brought on a host of other problems, so my onc took me off it 4 days ago--I'm curious to see if my mood darkens again.  I don't know if my mood got better because of the Megace or the holidays.  Time will tell, I guess.).  Point is, we should not have to bear depression for 5 years.  My dh had a colleague at work tell him that his wife took Tamox for 5 years and was suicidal the entire time, but they both believed in the power of Tamox, so they gutted it out.  That is not for me!  I am NOT going to give up 5 years of a happy life for a drug.  I will try to find a way to make it work, because all the reading I do on Tamox shows me that it does bring some benefit, but I'll stop taking it if my quality of life sucks.  Well, that was soapboxy, wasn't it? Kris, the next time you go in and have your implant drained, count the number of tubes they fill.  I was forever competing with myself!  I think 33 was the most in one draining, but I routinely filled around 20 tubes (and I was going in every other day for several weeks!).  The worst time was when they ran out of tubes in the exam room and the doc had that huge ass needle in me and we were both screaming for the nurse to bring in more tubes.  Sometimes this stuff is comedic! Glad to hear from Vetteguy!  Oh, and Patty, what's up with sending Karen to NYC on Californication????  I can't believe that show is going to benefit from that twist. So today we have tix to the G'town/Pitt basketball game.  Dd has to skip practice to go (this is the 3rd time she's missed a practice in her LIFE-my kids always went to practice even when they couldn't play due to injury).  She went in and asked the coach if missing practice would have a negative impact on her playing time and the coach was hesitant to let her miss (of course, other girls miss all the time and nothing happens to them.  Heck, she has one girl that routinely turns up stoned and she's the sixth man!).  I'll be totally pissed if she uses dd as the example for the team...  I think we'll have to thank the coach for her compassion or some other suck up bs.  Suck up ideas welcome. Tomorrow is big excitement in our house.  Well, the morning will suck because we have to clean up our holiday decorations, but the Vikings play in the afternoon.  I'm a little worried because our defense doesn't usually do well against a mobile quarterback and McNabb can really get around in the pocket, but maybe he'll do the right thing and run right into our QB sacking specialists!  I'll be cheering. So, on with the day (more coffee needed).  D1",

Fireworks in SanFran sounds sublime, SISKimberly!  I'm really happy you got to do that.  It sounds like you guys crawled through SF on your tummies!!!  Good eatin', eh? I really appreciated getting your card and poems.  Somehow several of you seemed to know that I needed some pick-me-ups and I got some great mail from the Jewels over the weekend.  Special thanks to Paula-I'm putting the wheat weaving with my Christmas tree decorations so I'll think of you every single year when we decorate the tree.  And Joan, that picture of Lucy was SOOO cute! HIP HOORAY to KathyL for the neg MRI!!!!  Now that's the way to start off a new year!  Looks like you're up for port removal this Friday.  I can only imagine the weight that will be lifted when you realize you don't need that any longer! You remind me-Patty, we have some Chex cereals around the house waiting to be made into Chex mix to send back to school with my college girl and you won't believe what's printed on the side of the Rice Chex box-a side panel devoted to Celiac Disease Foundation!  You are making me more aware-thanks! Tina-Joey is such a cutey!  Thanks for sharing the pix.  And I like the new avatar.  Your hair is looking good. (The Vikes suck.  And now they won't get a good draft pick...) Tennis elbow?  Oh man, Carla!  I hope you're feeling better soon. Okay, SISKimberly had me lol with her probing query into how one gets tennis elbow at this time of year... Thanks for the YouTube link.  Those fireworks were, to use your words, awesome! Your January plans sound great, Carol.  It sounds like you're working a few things for Carol into the plans, which makes me happy to see. Wow!  Your wine cooler sounds amazing!  I'll just drink what all you wine experts are drinking at our Jewel reunion-you all sound pretty sophisticated to me. Oh man, sorry to hear about the ds' knee cap.  I sure hope his p/t gets him back on his skates, soon.  I will say my dd's p/t did her a world of good. I wish I were more interested in a 3day and lived closer to you!  I'd love to share an experience like that with a Jewel (but you won't catch me in a pink tent!). Oh, and speaking of guitar hero, we had several contests over the holidays.  One night (after a bit of wine) I was on fire!  (Well, as on fire as you can be when you're playing the Easy level.)  I beat both of my kids, college girl's bf (he was playing on expert, tho), and my dh!  I haven't played since as I know I won't ever be that into the groove again! Oh, and I'll jump on the numbness bandwagon.  About half my boob is numb, extending to my pit and part way down my arm.  Shaving is still a hazard. Julie, you guys are WAY ahead of us on the remodeling.  My dh did say he'd like to go look at tiles this weekend, so maybe I'll get my bathroom back on track.  The new furniture sounds great and I've done some furniture assembly many times to save a few shekels.  It actually gives you a sense of accomplishment, doesn't it? Holy cow!  Now that's a buyer beware story on the vehicle, if I ever heard one!  Glad it worked out okay for you. Yes, Julie, we have undecorated.  We did it Sunday morning.  That is such a painful thing to do, isn't it? I'm so glad the nips are coming around.  That was quite a Christmas present, wasn't it? Oh Patty, I know about the feeling that you want to strip to get some relief from hot flashes.  My whole body temp gauge is on the fritz these days.  I'm having to layer to try to second guess how I'm going to feel at any given moment.  I think my family is tiring of it... What a score on the skis, Tina!!!  That is way cool!  I'm also jealous of the concerts.  I want to do more of that sort of thing, too.  Dh looked in to Fleetwood Mac tix (I passed on an opportunity to see them when I was in college and practically their groupie because I had an exam the next day-can you believe it???).  I'm not sure if he was able to get them, or not.  Perhaps they will be my bday present this year, since the concert isn't till March. Well, I wish the Purple People Eaters and Fran had shown up to play on Sunday!  Geez!  I keep telling dh that I want a Tarkenton throw back jersey as a present, but he says it would cost too much.  What a spoil sport. Don't feel bad, KathyL, we returned a gifted fondue set one time, too.  The problem with things like that is finding a place to store them when you're not using them.  I mean, it's fun every once in a while, but let's face it, most of the time it will be in the cupboard. Oh, and Tina, I had the same experience as Julie when I tried to access the photo album. Okay, Patty, lol at your butthole of America comment!  We've all felt that way at one time or another, trust me.  How cool that you won that trip, tho!  It sounds like it was just what you needed. Just what you needed to add to your frustration level, Sherry, is a lost post.  NOT!  I really hope the job thing straightens out for you.  The work from home sounded like a better fit for you than being on your feet at Kmart.  I'm sending you some positive vibes. CHJ, Hmmm, the Ravens, they DO wear purple... And then there's Patty, bleeding black and gold.  See, there IS something behind the color scheme. Sherry, so the lost is found (and I didn't even realize that I was reading the \"lost\" one).  Yay.  Can you believe how bad the Lions were this year????  As if Michigan needed something else to go wrong right now. Sherry, the depression from the Tamox is NOT something you should gut out.  Even though I still haven't settled on something to alleviate it, I am not going to stop trying.  And if I don't find anything to combat the depression, I'll stop the Tamox and talk to my onc about alternatives.  None of us should live under a blue cloud.  Please help yourself and talk to someone about it.  (Will you be my roomy in the loony bin???) Hooray for Tina and her good use of the BGPs!  Keep us posted on what they recommend to you as an alternative and why.  While I'm really trying to give Tamox a shot, unless I can shake the blues, I'll be looking at alternatives myself.  It doesn't sound like I'm the only one. Oh, and q-tip on, gf! So the Gateway is gone, huh, Paula?  How much fun is that to get a laptop to replace it?  I got my laptop last Spring and am wondering why I didn't have it while I was doing my chemo so I could've reclined on the sofa and posted here, instead of having to sit at my desk in the computer room.  Oh well.  Hope you transition to Apple smoothly. Boy, I hope dh is doing okay with his brothers as keepers now that you're back in school.  I know that must worry you all the time. Oh, yeah, my New Year's post.  I think I was coming off the Megace happy place... Ummm, full body shudder here, too.  No way lips for nips!!!! So there's Patty talking about how she wants to disrobe all the time and hang out in giant fridges to get rid of her hot flashes, then she pulls out the story of Vetteguy doing his Chippendale dance!  I would think that would make the hot flashes worse, not better!  (Or, that could depend on your perspective.) As for ways to control hot flashes, I haven't found one, yet.  I do have to wash my sheets every 2-3 days because I sweat with rivulets running down my body several times a night.  I will say that Ambien helps with the sleep and I seem to be on a pattern of taking them for 4 nights and sleeping well, then taking 4 nights off.  I have this crazy idea that I'll get addicted otherwise. Yeah, Carol, I chuckled at the \"coughed up a pixel,\" too.  Yes, we do need a chatteroo soon.  There is nothing but craziness this week as we get back into the routine, but even though college girl will be around next week, I'll bet we can work something in. LOL at the thought of skull and crossbones tats for the nips! Thanks for the info on your next steps, Tina.  Actually, the info you're getting from your onc sounds just like what my guy says to me.  He's hoping he can keep me on the Tamox for 5 years and then move to Arimidex for 5 years.  He likes the Tamox first because it's apparently better at beating the hormones (refer to Sherry's post about hormones coming from places other than your woman parts), and it builds bone density, whereas the AI's leech bone density.  Since osteoporosis runs in my family, we're trying to build the density first.  I'm even taking calcium supplements.  The only part of my whole game plan that puzzles me is why am I taking drugs for 10 years when most people only take them for five???? Okay, that was a weird dream, Paula.  Perhaps we need a 3 person suite in the loony bin, eh? Sorry to hear about the falling out with Vettesis, Patty.  Sometimes family can be so hard. Whew!  I think I'm caught up.  Hopefully my mood will be better and I'll feel more like posting so I don't have to do these marathons! D1",

Glad you're getting yourself checked out nine ways to Sunday, Paula.  The peace of mind will go a long way to helping your mental health (since I'm all about mental health right now).  I was very concerned reading about the change in the dh.  I'm sending all good thoughts that his MRI shows the swelling.  I really don't know how you do it-you are such an inspiration to us all. Oh, and yes, you can have your own bed.  I'm thinking king-sized beds for everyone! Man, Carol, your weather sounds just awful.  I'm glad to read that the high waters aren't affecting you-I hope it stays that way. Believe me, I've spent some time musing about the trade off-depression vs. bone aches.  The only problem is, I had SERIOUS bone aches with the neulasta (you'll recall that I fondly called it my fucking shot), so I'm a little gun-shy of bellying up for something that I know will put me back there.  Let's see how the Wellbutrin does... My menopause story is complicated.  If I had been post-menopausal, I would not have done chemo.  So I had several blood tests to check.  I think I had 3 all together.  Every single one of them indicated that I was post-menopausal and then, just to spite me, my body would produce a monthly menstrual cycle.  It was part of the reason there was such a time delay between my surgeries and chemo.  I finally decided that I'd rather deal with bc head-on, so I did chemo.  Of course, that has completely stopped my periods.  I haven't had one for 13 months now.  (Although I have to report that just over the past 2 days I've noticed some weird staining in my pants-sorry, TMI-but I'm not sure what that means.)  So, aren't you glad you asked??? CHJ-oh my, no need to apologize.  I'm glad you sailed through Tamox and harbor no ill-will towards those who do.  I will say I'm having a hard time finding women who tolerate it well.  When I talk about it around here (mostly at the gym) I hear all kinds of Tamox horror stories.  I can't believe they haven't come up with something better. Patty-you need the crappy weather so you appreciate those pink tulips all the more... Maz-good to hear from you, but I wish your news were better.  Radiation can cause dense spots (apparently I have been left with a few myself), but best to eliminate the bad things.  Much hand-wringing being done on your behalf.  Let us know what the tests say. I'm getting excited for the inauguration.  My dh works very close to the Capitol (his office windows overlook the area for the ceremony), so dd and I are going to Metro in sometime Monday afternoon and sleep in sleeping bags on his office floor with him and then either watch from his windows, or if the security will let us out on the streets, we'll walk over to join the throngs.  Dh has lined up a reception for us to attend Monday night, which he thinks will have enough for us to call dinner.  My issue is what on earth I'm going to wear!  I have to be kinda dressed up to be in his office, but we'll have to walk to this reception in the cold, so I don't want to be wearing heels.  I know, such a dilemma.  It's going to be weird getting home because all the bridges from DC to VA will be closed till Wednesday morning after the inauguration, so we're going to have to figure out a way to get back home in VA so dd can get to school on Wednesday morning (plus, one night sleeping on the office floor will be enough for me).   Perhaps we'll take a route that swings through Charm City (so I can stop in on LJ), and then over to West VA for me to check up on Paula and Carla!  Anyway, I went past a Metro stop today and bought our farecards because the lines on that Monday will probably be horrendous.  They're cool-they have Obama's picture on them. College girl just rang-she needs to be picked up (we need another car!).  Later. D1",

Then my college girl got me going on Facebook-which I don't really understand, yet.  I almost liked it better just juggling email and this thread! Upshot, I haven't checked in here.  I'm not feeling the whole going back thing, but I'll read through them. Want to shout out to Paula and dh on the new rx.  I'm not much of an expert, but it seems comforting to know that all dh's docs are on the same page with this one.  I sure hope it does the trick without too many se's. Also, got a pm from Patty, but I'm going to respond here so we can all weigh in.  Sounds like the dates are firming up (unless I read on to find them changed).  What I'd like to see us do is look into a couple of hotel options.  It sounds like you have a great connection at Planet Hollywood and that's a great place to start.  I'd also like to check on resorts that have one of those lazy river floaty things since it sounds like a number of Jewels want to be lazy and aren't big gamblers-maybe a place with more than just a pool (if the price is right) would be a better fit for this group.  Just thinking aloud here.  I've got a lot on my plate right now, but once I get past Jan. 30 (I'm planning senior night for our basketball, dance and cheer groups and it's stressing me out), I should have a little time to do some rooting around.  We'll see if we can come up with just the right accommodation for all of our varied needs (so far I'm hearing casino, lots of pool time with some shaded areas, fitness center-okay, that's probably just me-maybe a show.)  Does this sound right, you guys? As for bringing guests, I've talked this over with my dh and he said if I really wanted him to come along, he would, but not to expect him to hang with us.  To be honest, I would find it a little burdensome to balance his wishes with my own in this particular situation, so we've decided I'm attending solo.  Whatever you all decide is fine with me, just reporting my own decision. Oh, there's CathyCA, making some suggestions about itinerary.  What about it, should we plan a few activities? (I've been thinking about you, CathyCA, when I hear about the Boss at the Super Bowl!  He was in DC today for the inauguration concert, but I had to take college girl back to school, so I didn't get to the concert.  You probably would've told me to have her walk back to school and check out the Boss!!!  JK-or am I??????) Okay, I see us all being encouraging to KathyL about getting back to normal, but it really begs the question, what is normal???  And were any of us ever in that condition in the first place???  Just askin'. Carol, I never get to veg by a pool, so you def have a buddy in me for that! I like the idea of one group dinner, CathyCA.  Would you mind looking in to that?  I think Monday is as good a night as any (until we get the show schedules and figure out what's what with that).  I suspect with a group our size that we won't all be attached at the hip at all times, but breaking off in smaller groups to pursue like interests.  So a group dinner is good. SISKimberly, I cannot believe how that cold is holding on!  Hopefully the long weekend will give you a chance to rest and shake the darn thing. Oh, since there were a couple of inquiries, the Wellbutrin seems to help my moods-at least I'm not a raging bitch (at least I think not).  It is not helping with sleep, so last night I took an Ambien.  It felt so good that I'm taking another one tonight!  Not sure if I'll stay on the Wellbutrin as my gyn was going to research the info LJ found and we're going to talk about it later this month.  Sigh. Finally, the Inauguration plan.  Looks like dh will go to work tomorrow as normal, but use Metro instead of driving.  In the evening, I will Metro downtown (all dressed up with heels and all-I hate doing that on Metro!) and meet dh for a pre-inauguration dinner being thrown by the Oregon State Society.  I plan to do some recon on Lewis & Clark College to see if that sounds like the right place for my dd.  Then we Metro back home (and get dd to pick us up from the station because by then I am NOT walking the 1.25 mi. home in my heels-these are my \"fuck me shoes,\" so it's a skinny, high heel.). Tuesday morning, dh and I are going to get up as close to 3a as we can and take one of our cars to a Metro stop and park it there.  The lots are opening at 3a and are limited, so we're going to do our best to snag a spot.  Then we'll come home, get dressed and walk to the Metro and either subway or bus in to DC.  Then we'll hike to dh's office, where I have to change in to office attire to hang out (I'm sending my outfit in with dh when he goes to work tomorrow).  We're probably gonna hang in his office for the swearing in (it's right next to the Capitol building and has excellent views) and wait for the motorcade to pass by before heading back out for home.  We are not staying for the parade, and unfortunately, it starts a block away from dh's office, so we can't watch from there.  We plan to walk the length of the mall to see if we can find any appropriate inauguration memorabilia to buy.  We catch a bus by the Lincoln Memorial back to our Metro stop and our car, waiting for us in the lot.  Hopefully, we will be able to get on the bus!  We're hopeful that we can walk the mall and get to the bus stop before the parade ends and the crowds start to exit DC en masse.  It will be cold and tiring, I know, but we're all excited. I hope you all are able to watch it on TV!!  It's history in the making, baby!! Hmmm.  It's Miller Time.  Later!",

      "Content": "Jan 25, 2009 09:38AM Determined1 wrote: You guys must wonder what happened to me.  I've been busy with my 28 page senior night program-getting bios from these kids, pictures, printing quotes, etc.  And now the girls' basketball coach has decided she wants to be in charge of senior night, so much of the work I've done has to be redone.  (Our coach is losing it.  At the game last Wednesday, one of her up and coming players forgot to bring her uniform to the game.  So instead of telling her to sit that game out-which would have taught the girl not to forget her uniform again-she asked one of the senior players who rarely gets in to the game to give her uniform to the forgetful player!  I cannot tell you how shocked the parents were when we saw the forgetful one take off her warmup to see her sporting a teammate's number.  The coach tried to make it up to the senior by buying her a Starbuck's card, to which the senior replied, \"I don't want that.\"  The coach told her to take it as it would make the coach feel better.  Can you believe that coach is an adult????) Inauguration.  What an experience!  Of course, nothing went as planned, but it didn't matter.  The Monday night reception was even changed up.  Dh told me not to wear the fuck me shoes as there was going to be a lot of walking.  So I dug out an old pair of suede pumps with a low chunky heel-didn't do great things for my legs, but were more practical.  Thank goodness I was willing to compromise fashion!  I Metroed in, but it took forever.  There was a crush of out-of-towners trying to use my sleepy little Metro stop and they were balling up the works.  I heard two trains take off while I was waiting in line just to have my card read.  So I finally get to my Metro stop and come above ground.  There were hoards of people everywhere.  There were many vendors hawking Obama stuff (pins, shirts, hats, socks, and yes, even Obama air fresheners for your car!).  There was no traffic in the streets as they had been closed and were completely clogged with people.  Many of whom were dressed up for the unofficial balls to be held that evening, but the ladies were carrying their shoes and had on Uggs for walking!  We went to two different receptions and ran in to lots of folks we knew.  We Metroed back home. Tuesday morning, instead of getting up early to take a car to the Metro stop, we decided to risk trying to park that day.  We ended up parking in the neighborhood next to the Metro where the street parking is by permit only, but decided it must be a holiday, so the restrictions would not be enforced.  We got lucky.  It was only about a block and a half to the Metro.  So we get to the platform and it was six people deep (usually, if there are 10 people on our stop's platform, it's crowded).  The first train pulled in to the station and it was already so packed that no one from our station got on.  We got a great idea to take the next train headed OUT of DC and ride it to the end of the line and then turn around and come back.  It worked.  We even got to sit.  Good thing, as when we reached the end of the line, the train stayed in the station for 45 minutes!  And people packed on to it just as soon as we pulled in, so we were sardines for the entire time.  Eventually, it started moving, but since there were so many extra trains on the tracks, we had to wait 10-20 minutes at each station stop before continuing our journey.  At one stop we looked out the window and found some guy dressed up like Waldo, so he could do the \"Where's Waldo?\" thing in the crowd.  When we looked closer, we realized it was college girl's old photo teacher (she took 4 years of photo, so we got to know him).  We banged on the window and he came over and waved and hopped around to see us.  What a character. Okay, we finally get to our Metro stop after spending about an hour and a half with the people in our car.  Everyone was in a great mood.  Whenever the car moved, we cheered.  There was singing and just general good vibes.  It felt wonderful.  And it made me so proud.  There were people that had come in from all over the US (even one woman from Senegal), we were all the colors of the rainbow, and yet, we all felt like one.  I can't imagine any other president-elect would have evoked that feeling. Back to the story.  Now we faced about a 15 block walk to dh's office, which was within the .25 mile secure zone around the Capitol.  We supposedly had a separate gate to access his building-our social security numbers and info had been given to the secret service in mid-December for security-but the crowd was so huge it just carried us with it.  At one point, dh (who is 6'5\"-handy for looking over everyone) saw a path of less resistance if we flattened ourselves against the side of a building and slid behind the bushes.  Oh yes, we did that.  Then we ended up back in the stream of humanity.  Since dh is so tall, people were handing their cameras to him so he could take pictures of the crowds.  Again, everyone was jolly, even though we were so tightly jammed together that all you had to do was lift your feet every once in a while and the crowd moved you along.  We finally arrived at our separate entrance (I'm not sure how, I don't think if I'd been on my own that I would have made it) and found security to be a breeze (at least for us, but remember, we'd been cleared the month before and that paid off big time). Once in his office, we had a view of the Capitol out of the window and dh tuned his computer to CNN, so we just swiveled our heads around and got the TV coverage, too.  The motorcade with Obama and Bush went right in front of the building and we could see them waving from the windows.  Then, with binoculars, we could see Aretha (she wasn't as good as I expected), Joe take the oath, and then Obama take the oath.  It was so cool to watch the Obamas say goodbye to the Bushes on TV (that took place on the other side of the Capitol building, so we couldn't watch it real time), then we turned around and saw the helicopter clear the Capitol dome on its way to Andrews Air Force Base.  Unbelieveable.  We then wandered up to the building's rooftop only to find a couple of news crews set up for broadcasts.  At first, we didn't recognize the on-air talent and suddenly realized that one of them was Rev. Al Sharpton.  Dd loves the Rev (frankly, I find it hard to believe that a 17yo kid even knows who he is, but then it's my strange dd we're talking about), so she lined herself up to take a photo so it looked like they were together.  Dh obliged by taking the shot.  I think it now adorns her Facebook page... Then we went back into the building and chilled and ate (now here's where it was great to be in dh's office!) until the parade was to begin.  The parade did not go by the office, but the presidential motorcade did on its way to join the parade.  You could see both the Obamas and the Bidens in their limos waving as they went by.   And the street was lined with uniformed military personnel from all branches of the military and they all saluted as the cars went by.  Way cool. Once the parade got underway, we decided it was our time to leave.  Most of the swearing in crowd had dispersed (we watched them leaving from our perch), and we figured the rest of the folk would be at the parade.  Well, the streets were still closed to traffic, so they were filled with people, but we were able to get around.  The only difficulty was we kept running in to roadblocks, so we'd have to walk several blocks the wrong direction to get to our destination.  Our plan was to walk along the Metro line till we found a station that wasn't all crowded ABOVE ground (cause that would mean crowds on the platforms below).  After stopping along the way to buy pins and t-shirts (the prices came way down after the ceremony was over), we finally found a stop that looked to be operating as normal.  Lo and behold, even though the platform was three people deep, the first train that came in to the station was our line and all those people were waiting for a different line.  So we hopped right on.  We had to stand, but who cared?  We had an uneventful trip to our little outpost and got in our car for home.  We were exhilarated and exhausted simultaneously.  And we saw history first-hand.  All I can say is, God Bless America. I should really read through everyone's posts, but I doubt anyone would want this post to get any longer, so I'll do it later.  But please know I was thinking about you guys all day long. Later, gang. D1",

Not sure I'll get to this today--I'm hoping to finalize my senior night program and get it to the printer.  But it's on my list to do! Shouts later, too. G2G. D1",

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2009 08:41AM - edited Feb 1, 2009 08:43AM by Determined1 Well it's finally Super Bowl Sunday, but more importantly, in my house, it's also the dh's b-day!  I've gotten some gifts together, but I need to run out and get a card.  It's always sumthin.' Carol, I read all the supplements you take with interest.  I did some research yesty on Biotin and Tamox to see if it would be okay for me to add Biotin.  I understand it can help with hair/nail growth and my hair is totally stalled with patchy thin areas.  I know that hair thinning is a Tamox se and since I seem to be an se magnet, I'm not surprised.  I'm just tired of this thin, lifeless hair.  (Can I have a little cheese with my whine?)  So I'm also going to have to find time to hit up a vitamin store in the near future. LJ-WooooHoooo on being done with your infusions!  Do you get the port out, now?  (Thanks again for alerting me to the Tamox/Wellbutrin connection.) So is your Zometa infusion this week, Carol?  I think Paula has suggested a thong for the BGP.  Certainly, it would be distracting to have all that fabric crammed up your butt... Joan, I kinda laughed at the prospect of toasting our survival-I suspect there will be much imbibing with this group! Good to hear from you, Maz!  I put Wellbutrin and Arimidex in my Google box and didn't come up with any of the negative articles I get when it's Tamox.  Not sure if LJ has other ideas?  I'm sorry you're having to go in for surgical biopsies.  I know my tolerance for such things is way low.  But it really is best to eliminate bad things, so you must (I hate it when people use logic with me, so you're welcome to turn off your computer in disgust about now!) grab the BGP (remember, they're now a thong!) and march on in with your head up.  We'll be here, awaiting your results. I'm kinda laughing at the visual of you moving your sectional with all of that heavy equipment, Julie!  Isn't snow fun???  (There won't be any in LV...)  Hope you got your painting done.  We went out to look at tile for our bathroom project.  We're still waiting for the last estimate to come in, but we figured we'd get a jump start on making some of the selections.  I'm going to head to another store, farther out, this week and bring some samples home now that I know what dh likes.  I'm starting to get a little excited about this.  And I want to get the project cranked out as the next thing on the list is some landscaping before we have a graduation party here for dd-Spring is coming (I hope) so that project will be on the front burner sooner than I think! Can I switch to your doctor, SISKimberly?  I'd love someone to tell me how young I am!  Sounds like the ooph is in your future, then.  GREAT news on the 10 pounds-that's a lot of work!  And I'm in your camp when it comes to gambling-I set myself a limit and when I lose it, I'm done.  LOL-Lady Luck's version of a hot flash!!!!! Paula, you get a gold star for doing all that financial stuff.  WTG.  I've already done the filings for my company, but dh and I haven't started the personal stuff, yet.  Heck, April 15 is a ways off! Patty, you're hurting my brain, but here's an attempt at your questions: Favorite TV shows:  Entourage, Hell's Kitchen, pretty much any cooking show unless the host is a complete dolt, Grey's Anatomy, The Daily Show w/Jon Stewart, Saturday Night Live (when it's funny), (the story line on Californication is losing me-I'm a big fan of Karen). Favorite bands:  Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Crosby/Stills/Nash/Young (or any combination), 2pac, and I'm starting to really like Slightly Stoopid, particularly when they do instrumental numbers. Favorite songs:  I have two:  Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd and Landslide by Fleetwood Mac.  I'm also replaying (Fork and Knife) by Brand New a lot lately. That's really tough to boil down to a few!!! D1",

Did the heating pad help, Vettegal?  Where is your lump incision?  Mine is on top of my nipple in a 3\" long arc from about 10 o'clock to 3 o'clock, so the heating pad resting on the top of Frankenboob and then folding under my arm to catch the node incision works.  I've never figured out if the heating pad or the glass of wine is doing the trick! Would everyone please feel better?  Reading about so many colds makes me think I might have one... D1",

I hate unexpected bummer news.  I'll bet you're all a muddle with the extended tx's and a port to boot.  From what I've read, with 8 tx you're going to be happy to have the port.  I'm a little worried with 4 tx's that I might blow some veins and with 8 I think the risk is far too great to take.  Scroll back through our thread, there were some conversations about port placement a few pages ago that you may find helpful. And do me a flavor, will ya?  I'm trying to keep the Jewel Roll Call at the top of the page up to date (as is KathyL, who is double-checking my work via her written list), and need a little more info from you on your tx.  You start 1/17 for 8 tx.  But what is your chemotini?  And will you imbibe every two or every three weeks or what?  And then what's your tx with herceptin?  I know, I'm a question girl.  Sorry 'bout that. Oh, and I sure understand how you feel about telling people.  I was dx'd in August and am just now telling people!  I mean, my family and close friends knew, but since I'm not full-time employed right now, I've been doing lots of volunteer work and haven't told many of the people I \"manage\" at my volunteer sites.  A few know because I found heavy lifting impossible after my many surgeries (I was a monthly drive-thru surgery customer for a while!), but others are only finding out now because I'm tiring more easily and need to ask them to step up more.  It was interesting the other day when I asked a woman to take a more responsible role for a project we have going and told her I couldn't really do it cuz I have bc and am in chemo.  She was so surprised and then showed me her new girls, courtesy of her bc experience in 2004!  It's so funny to me how we bc gals immediately pull our shirts tight to show off our survivorship!  I find myself doing it to show off my lopsidedness!  We're so sick. :)  Anyway, my point (what was my point?) is tell people on your own schedule.  Word'll get out some and that's okay.  You'll know when it's time to share.

First of all, a big yippee kayoo hurray to Billsgirl and the BRCA results! And welcome to Trudy and Paula, there's always room for more facets to the Jewels. SIS Kimberly--so glad your se's are a bit better.  I'm impressed that you're doing chores around the house--that's a good sign.  Don't worry, try the pumpkin loaf again in a few days, I'll bet you'll be able to taste it. Carol--thanks for reposting the t-shirt info.  How are you doing se-wise?  WTF happened to the Seahawks???? I'm so glad your dad is doing better, KathyL.  And you're amazing the way you're on top of the Jewel activity for the week.  Thanks so much for your effort.  It helps all of us (what are we going to do when you develop chemo brain???  Argh!  I hate to even consider it!!) Julie--Are you feeling better?  I'm with everyone else--there HAS to be something they can give you for nausea.  Please start bugging people in the morning, if you haven't already done so. AZDonna--you sound like you're doing well.  Good for you.  You have less time than I to adjust for your next tx and I'm happy to hear that your head sounds like it's in the right place.  Wait patiently for the rodents--the infestation is coming!!! Hmmm.  Rodents.  Yep, there was a large city rat in the drain today.  Didn't even know I had that much left!  Speaking of rats, my hair looks downright ratty.  I started wearing a do-rag in public today.  I tied it in the back, but I'm kinda itching to try the tie on top, like Tupac.  Not sure my kids will approve, tho.  They want me to act my age sometimes.  My hairdresser returns from her trip on Tuesday and will shave me either that evening (doesn't seem fair to ask her to do it right away--she'll have laundry to do) or Wednesday after my infusion (when I won't be able/want to drink).  Such a dilemma. I'm not sure what is the best approach to this hair fall out thing.  If I had clippers (or wasn't too cheap to buy my own), I'd have shaved myself by now (honestly, the hair is FUGLY ugly).  But the advantage to waiting is that I can pull this stuff out and maybe skip the whole mange look.  It seems that once you shave, the stubbly bits are reluctant to come out, leaving mange.  And since I'm so coyote ugly now (you know, I'd chew off my own arm to get away from myself!), I don't think I deserve any time in mange purgatory.  Just my take. Wig story.  Well, since I waited till my hair was falling out (note to other Jewels--get your wig before you lose your hair--not sure what I was thinking, except maybe some denial???), the ladies at the wig shop weren't too excited to have me trying on everything in the store, leaving my \"mark\" on their merchandise.  So, they did their best to choose a good color by holding hair up to my face and then they peppered me (and my family) with questions about the kind of hair I wanted and brought out 3 wigs.  So I only tried on 3.  That was a little disappointing, but the four of us (dh, college girl, 16yo and I) laughed our way through the experience.  One of the ladies even came over and said she wanted to know why we were laughing so much!  We didn't even know what we found so funny.  It was good.  They voted for hair much like what I had before my Katie Holmes 'do, except its a little lighter.  I wanted to go a bit darker, but everyone in the shop thought it a bad idea since my skin is getting so sallow and pasty (can we go to tanning salons while we're in tx?  I REALLY need a tan!). So here's the lesson for everyone else--may I repeat?  Get your wig before your hair falls out!  I didn't realize that you don't just walk in, choose a wig off the shelf and leave.  Oh no.  My wig has to be re-tied (I think that's whats happening to it) because my head is so small.  Yep, a pea brain here.  I like to think it means less room for rocks.  Bad news is that I don't get my new hair till Thursday.  Guess I'll have a chance to tie that do-rag in the front... Also bought two of those turban things with the long ties (geez, they were $25 each--I should've asked before I picked out two of them) and one of those knitted sleep caps (I can actually see myself wearing that bad boy quite a bit).  I spent just under $600 for the whole shebang.  I thought that was a lot, but I do live in an expensive area (DC), so maybe I should be happy.  My dh had heard the wig was going to run over $1000, so he was relieved.  Now I have to submit to insurance (part of the reason I waited was because I didn't have my wig rx till late last week and it turns out you have to buy first and then submit, the wig shops don't work like doc's offices--what was I thinking????). Learn from my mistakes, Jewels.  I'm in the early group for a reason--I'll make every mistake in the book and share it with you! Good luck tomorrow to KathyL, Jenn51, Trudy and RN2teach with the port thing.  Be sure to wear your usual bra so they know where the straps go and have an idea where the seat belt hits you so they can avoid that, if possible. I'm always with my friends here, even when I'm not online.  Stay well, gang. Onward through the fog! D1",

Yesterday's first-timers--you guys sound great!  I can't tell you how happy that makes me.  Hang in there. CarolC--I echo Julie, try Tylenol PM.  That stuff knocks me right out.  I get my Neulasta on Friday and I take it Sat. and Sun. nights.  I also lived on max strength tylenol Sunday--Thursday to fight off bone pain (I'm in that 33%, I guess) and then my back spasms (more on those later).  Sweet dreams! Okay, the shaving party.  May I say, I TOTALLY rock the balditude!  I have a teeny, weeny head, but nicely shaped.  I've always had bangs, so the high forehead is taking some getting used to, but oh my gosh, you guys, this is okay.  We drank some wine, the dh took some pics (I'll try to figure out how to post later--after I've looked at them!).  We did some craziness on the way to total cueball--at one point I just had bangs!  Too funny.  The shaved head is not exactly what I imagined.  Apparently, we are not to use razors for that close shave (not sure why), so there's a little stubble.  I did notice that with vigorous rubbing with my towel this a.m. some of that came off.  It'll take a while to get smooth, and may I never will, but I love the Balditude.  I wash my head with liquid Neutrogena soap (same thing I use on my face) and then put a little conditioner in my hand and condition my scalp.  The lady at the wig store also suggested Jergen's Healing Therapy lotion (I think that's what it's called--I'll have to check the next time I'm at Target) for the head.  You do need to keep it moisturized so you don't get flakes.  I'm totally into the doo-rag look and returned one of the two turbans I bought because I just can't see myself wearing them.  I picked up my wig today and it's pretty good, but I want to see my normal hairdresser for some trim work because the 70 year old woman helping me at the wig store just didn't get me.  It's not bad, it just needs a little work.  Neither of my girls noticed that I had a wig on the first time they saw me, so I take that as a good sign.  It's easier than you think, really.  The worst of it is the anticipation (just like that first infusion), once it starts coming out, you'll want it off cause it gets real dull and damaged looking.  But have fun with it.  Yeah, you do look sick all of a sudden, but you're NOT--you're kicking cancer's ass and this is your badge of honor.  Plus, it's one se that doesn't have pain or discomfort associated with it.  Oh, my head itched in prep and felt kinda numb for about a week before, then when it started coming out, it felt like I'd had a too-tight pony tail that I just took out, but that was only when I touched my head--so don't touch!  The hot water in the shower is weird/good--you can almost feel your follicles releasing the hair!  Be ready to clean up a lot after yourself--you do make a mess.  And using my brush after the shower was strange--I had to pull hair out of it at least 3 times just to get the darn thing over my head!  Like I say, the shaving is good.  I wish I hadn't had to wait so long for my hairdresser to get back to town or I'd have done it much sooner.  It's all good.  We are still Jewels! Okay, infusion day.  I arrived for my onc appointment 20 minutes late--traffic was a bear.  Turned out, he was giving a presentation from 8-9am and didn't get to the hospital himself till 9:15, so I figure he was just getting his coffee and taking off his coat for that 5 minutes before I got there.  I didn't sweat it.  So they hurry me in to an exam room, telling me I'd do my bloodwork after seeing the doc.  I was there for 40 minutes!  Twice I opened the door and looked out, but no one was in the hallway (and I was dressed in one of those gowns, so I didn't want to run around too much, if you know what I mean).  Finally, I left my door open.  Soon, the doc comes rushing in saying he'd returned from his speech and got started on dictation and didn't know I was in the exam room till he started ordering chemo cocktails for the day and I popped up on his computer screen as in a room!  Grr.  Not a great start. So he asks about my se's.  I tell him about the minimal stuff first and explain that I didn't find any of them horrible and that they each only lasted a short time, so it was okay.  He said, Hmm, I sure got hit with a lot of se's for the first time--that it was unusual.  Yada.  Then I told him about my back spasms.  He listened, furrowed his brow, and told me that's not an se of anything I'm taking.  WTF??  That was the worst thing that happened to me!  I told him I wanted to try massage or physical therapy, because I don't want to live on muscle relaxants.  He said, it's not an se, maybe I won't have it this time and I do have the relaxant and can use up my old percocets as a backup.  I was not happy, but clearly he bristles at being told what to do by a patient.  Not a good start. Then to bloodwork.  I was told everything would be done via fingerstick to accommodate my fear of needles.  Well, they had orders to get more details from my blood yesterday and needed to do a regular draw.  I was upset from my doc appointment and the fact that I was now 1/2 hour late to my chemo appointment, so I started with the big tears rolling down my cheeks.  The tech was nice and waited for me to get my sh*t together, and I was kinda embarrassed (I'm not a crier, but it was too much already).  I was a big girl and got the blood drawn and have a big ole bruise today that has me pissed off. So up to the chemo lounge.  Where my dh and I are told the computers are down, so we'll have to wait for my blood results before the chemotini could be ordered (if I'd known I was going to have the wait to see my doc, I could've gotten the blood drawn earlier, saved some tears, and the wait in the chemotini lounge, but NOOOOO).  My chemotini was to start at 10:30 and I was finally hooked up at 12!  Everything went swimmingly, till the Taxotere arrived.  Last time, I sailed through the whole thing, so everyone was pretty loosy goosey with me, figuring I'd established myself as tolerating this stuff okay, so they left me.  (Oh, and by the time I got placed for my chemotini, they were out of loungers, so I ended up taking it in a hospital bed--not the best, I didn't think.)  So a few minutes into the T, I said to my dh, hey, if something goes wrong, please tell them that my hand started tingling this time.  Moments later, I'm coughing these little coughs, kinda like throat clearing.  Then I realize that my windpipe is tightening.  I tell the dh to get someone right away.  He goes down the hall and tells the nurse, I think my wife is having a bad reaction.  Well, I had 8 nurses in my room faster than anything!  By the time they got there (30 seconds after the dh left the room, maybe?), I was completely purple and getting no air, despite repeated attempts to gasp some in.  One nurse hurdled my bed and pulled all my plugs, which brought immediate relief.  Another hooked me up to get blood pressure (which wasn't too bad, considering) and checked other vitals.  I was doing much better.  Although I could see my 6'5\" dh over the heads of the nurses and saw him with eyes wide open and hand covering open mouth--I'm sure it looked bad to him.  They gave me benedryl and ativan, then some Pepcid to counteract heartburn se's.  Then I waited for a half hour to get right again.  Then they started my drip, but s-l-o-w-l-y.  By now I'm happy to be in the bed as all that stuff made me sleepy and I dozed off for about two and a half hours while they dripped the Taxotere.  After that, came the Cytoxan, which went fine.  I was in the hospital for 9 hours yesterday!  My poor dh had planned a retirement party for a friend that evening and totally missed it.  I came home and drank 2 glasses of wine, ate dinner, and went to bed.  Slept great!  (Thank God for wine!) Today I feel good (steroid high) so I did everything under the sun.  Went to the gym, took my dog in for grooming (and picked her up in the afternoon, because I'm just a good dog owner that way), picked up my wig, and tried to see my surgeon to check my lump (the onc felt it yesterday and didn't like it, either.  Helps with the confidence!).  Surgeon was running behind and bumped up against my wig appointment, so I left without seeing him.  (Waited for 45 minutes in his waiting room--the whole waiting thing is getting old!)  His nurse rescheduled me for his first appointment tomorrow at 8:45, so hopefully I'll have some answers on the lump front soon.  I think I'm going to see if I can get a massage therapy script out of him--worth a try! So, in a nutshell, I like baldness, I don't like waiting for appointments, I'm not wild about bad Taxotere reactions, I like wine. Hope everyone is still smiling.  I am.  (Till I get that f*cking Neulasta shot tomorrow!) Onward, Jewels!  We got cancer by the balls! D1",

KathyL--You sound better and better every day.  Just in the nick!  I hear you on the hating the wig thing--can't stand mine.  I only wear it to my 16yo's basketball games because she wants/needs me to look normal in front of her peers.  The rest of the time I just wear scarves.  I prefer the cotton ones as they stay put better, but I'm wearing pretty much whatever is in my drawer that matches my clothes.  Around the house, I go topless. Maz, you mentioned your sensitive stubble.  Yes, I recall mine was sensitive and got even more so about 10 days after my 2nd tx (I'd been bald for almost 2 weeks at that point).  But everyday I aggressively towel my head and find the stubble in the towel (so it's still falling out).  In fact, now all I have left is the stuff that must not be coming out as it's even grown a teeny tiny amount.  You can really only see it when I'm backlit as it's gray hair (yikes!).  My 16yo thinks I should buzz it off again, but I'm thinking it may be the beginning of my new hair and I don't want to prolong the wait for hair any more than I have to by re-buzzing it.  I'm also curious to see if it gets sensitive again after my tx on Wednesday... CarolC--Goodness girl, you went through it, didn't you?  Sure sounds like it coulda been food poisoning.  Particularly since it seems to be passing so quickly.  Stay outta that restaurant!  You know, if you don't have problems with the Taxotere (they give you the Benedryl for that and it makes you drowsy), I don't think adding the Cytoxan to your cocktail will prevent you from driving.  I surely could have driven myself after my first tx, but at the second tx I had a reaction to the Taxotere and had to have Benedryl and Ativan--both things that make you sleepy, so I couldn't drive after that one.  I'm guessing they're going to give me Benedryl prophylactically this time (they don't want a repeat of my bad reaction), so I'm going to have a designated driver.  Why don't you call your infusion center and ask them if they anticipate administering anything to you that will prevent you from driving (or maybe its your onc you should call).  Might help you prepare. Oh man, SIS Kimberly, you sound better and better.  That week after chemo just sucks, doesn't it?  Now that you're a week out, you can be a human again!  YAY! Kris, I'm glad to hear you're able to eat, now that you've got your pooper under control.  Enjoy it while it lasts. Finally, SharonT--we've missed you!  I know what you mean about the smell--my dh says I smell like a dry cleaners!  Overall, though, you sound like you're doing okay.  Stop by more often. Oh, and welcome to a new Jewel, Peg1212, who pm'd her tx info to me.  I've added her to the header (please check it for accuracy, Peg).  Chime in any time, someone's always here. Later, ladies. D1",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2008 12:57PM Determined1 wrote: Oh me-o, my-o.  So many posts!  I'll ask forgiveness up front--I'm feeling really out of it today.  I guess I'm picking up Julie's fog where she dropped it off.  I'm tired, unfocused, prone to error and forgetfulness.  (Possibly the added steroids?  I guess I can blame it on all sorts of things!)  Anyway, been itchin' to see what everyone is up to, but between my running to appointments and trying to build in rest time, I've been lax.  Let's see how much damage I can do in this altered state... CarolC--Please don't be so hard on your wig.  (Take it from one who is also hard on her wig!)  It's a nice wig--you'd probably like it more if you styled it in a way more familiar to you (I should be taking this advice...).  In all honesty, it looks very nice on you (particularly liked the shot in your infusion center).  Just try to relax with the thought that it's not \"your\" hair (again, I should be taking notes).  And, yes, you ARE a bad girl--making your onc blush!  tsk tsk. Joan--Hooray that your hip pain is easing!  (Although I agree with you that having someone tell you hip pain is a good thing isn't what you want to hear!) Jackie--Please make time for yourself.  It sounds like you're burning candles at both ends, and we all know where that leads... KathyL--Oh yeah, just say no to Ativan!!  Way to go.  I let them talk me into it and I hate that stuff (I have a high reaction factor when it comes to meds and Ativan sends me for a real loop).  I'm crossing my fingers that the evil constipaty stays away this time and that you tolerate the nasty-lasta okay. CHJ--Bummer on the delay.  It really messes with your headgame, doesn't it?  Just take care of yourself and feel better for Monday.  (Date change duly noted.  Please let me know if other infusions will be affected.  Thx.) LJ13--Big hip, hip hoorays all around!!!  AC went DOWN!!!  And you sound like you're still smiling.  Way to go, girl!!! Dana--I'm so sorry I was MIA for the past few days.  You got some great advice/hugs from everyone, which made me feel better for you.  God must have a lot of faith in you that you would have so many trials in life.  Please keep striving for the kind of life you want and deserve.  From your posts, I can see that you have accepted so many challenges with grace, and I have every reason to believe you will continue to do so.  I was particularly struck by the challenge of the diarrhea on your hand--this is why you're going to be a nurse and I won't!  Hang in there. Vettegal--Headaches?  Taste buds?  Maybe it's the Chinese food!  No, I've been having horrible headaches for the week after tx.  I went off coffee for both of the first two tx's and I'm trying to down a cup each day with this round, just to see if it was something with the caffeine denial.  The coffee tastes awful already (although the caramel macchiato-sp? from Starbucks was okay yesty...), but I'm giving it a try.  My tastebuds are reacting much like KathyL's--about ten days after tx they start coming back.  It hasn't been 100%, but it's manageable.  (Try chocolate cake--I'm telling you, I can taste that for some reason!) Maz--OMG--I'm having the WORST hot flashes!  They wake me up several times at night.  In fact, I stopped wearing my little nightcap to bed to try to keep cool.  I still kick off the sheets about 8 times a night and then get cold and have to cover up. Doesn't help much when you're trying to get some sleep...  Not sure how to combat those, just trying to live with them.  Love the pic in your avatar, BTW! Kris--What great news about the free neulasta shots!  So you're not sleeping either?  As you can see from my last shout out, I'm struggling with hot flashes at night, which are keeping me up.  I agree with whomever said steriods and stress add to the mix.  Let's face it, we're sending a lot of poison into our bodies, sleep loss is to be expected, I guess.  I do get a good night if I take a random Tylenol PM.  That only seems to work for one night, as when I've taken them successive nights, they don't touch me (and I'm really a med wimp--they all affect me).  But I can take one every 3-4 nights and snooze away, which seems to be getting me through--sort of. SIS Kimberly--ah, all the discomforts!  Yep, I have dry nose.  So dry, it bleeds.  Try A+D ointment.  Put it on a Q-tip and swipe it around inside your nostril.  It does bring some relief--although you'll permanently smell baby diaper smell!  Yep, I have watery eyes for no reason.  Had to stop wearing my contacts.  Haven't found a cure for that one, except to keep a tissue handy so it doesn't look like I'm crying all the time.  Yep, I'm losing my eyelashes.  So far I'm just using an eye pencil to line my eyes (trying to stay away from the scary rock star look), and then I use a mascara primer to plump up what lashes I have left and apply mascara.  It's not quite the same, but it gets me through.  Yep, I have a sore anus.  I tend to make my morning deposit and then hop in the warm shower, which helps some.  It's those deposits throughout the day that aren't convenient to a shower that give me the most problems...  Maybe those wipes LJ13 was talking about would help.  Can't believe we've been reduced to this!!! Oh, some good news, my surgeon called in a script to not only extend my physical therapy for the spasms throughout the remainder of my tx, but he also called in one for a consultation for lymphadema, and recommended that I get fitted for one of those sleeves for flying.  As soon as I'm done here, I'm going to call the rehab center and see if I can make my appointments and get moving. Not looking forward to the next 72 hours, forgive me if I'm not around, but I promise to come up smiling when I'm done with this round of se's.  Please know I'm thinking of my sisters in se-land, and wishing them to be few and far between. You guys are awesome!!!  D1",

Dana--I'm a little concerned that the nurse is reading your scan and giving you info when your docs have already seen the same thing and weren't as concerned.  Sometimes those hi res scans \"see\" things that aren't as ominous as they initially appear.  (Reference Vettegal's experience with her mom.)  I know it's the weekend and hard to wait (oh, my, we've all waited so many times on this journey and it never gets any easier), but try to relax until you speak with your doctors next week.  I think you have enough on your plate right now--you don't need to add anxiety over this.  Chin up. CHJ--I hope you're feeling better.  My dh and dd went to a movie today (Atonement), and I really wanted to see it with them, but all that kept replaying in my head was \"don't go out with the public and get sick when you're in se-land--remember CHJ!!\"  So I sucked it up and am home talking to my sisters.  Sorry to use you as an example, but I do appreciate your taking the bullet for all of us as a reminder on this one.  Lots of rest and tlc so you're ready to belly up on Monday! OMG Vettegal, I was so totally with you holding back on your shart!  (Our family shorthand for a productive fart, ie. diarrhea.)  I agree with SIS Kimberly, your future passengers are mighty relieved that your butt muscles have so much control! KathyL--you sound good today.  And you got the bar bill together for the week.  I'm impressed.  I'm also amazed to see how many Jewels will be in the lounge this week.  We all do take our turns, don't we?  I really hope the neulasta keeps your counts happy this time, we don't need any more drama! SIS Kimberly--I agree with your son, you participated in that family's American Dream.  That's so cool.  And you sound like you're making the best of your good days, which is also cool.  Is the extra strength GasX pill form?  (Hmm. Nice segue to a gas question, sorry bout that.) I'm really having trouble with the gas, but only have those melt in your mouth GasX strips, which I'm concerned will aggravate my blisters in my mouth.  Maybe I'll send the dh to the grocery after the movie to see about something in pill form (cause I sure can't get enough of those!). Julie, Julie, Julie--you sound like the energizer bunny!   I was exhausted just reading about your outing!  You keep it up, girl!! No big plans for the birthday, yet.  I've requested a chocolate cake (I know you're all shocked to hear that).  My in-laws have invited us over for dinner tomorrow, but I may just eat a fried egg and veg in the corner (everyone's good with that, if that's how I feel).  Dh is making a Peruvian stew for my bday dinner (beef, veggies, noodles--healthy, not too spicy stuff, everything in bite size pieces).  I'm thinking the real party will be next weekend when college girl comes home and I'm feeling better.  Besides, my little one has a basketball game Monday night and it would absolutely make my day if she gets to play a lot and plays well. I mentioned a Sister Soiree (Jewels Junkett?) to my dh today and he thinks it would be good.  So I'd like to throw my hat in!  I like warm climes. :) Thinking of everyone, today.  Hoping we're all managing our se's.  (Oh I'm trying a little coffee this time around, like I said the other day and the headaches aren't so bad!!  Learning every time.) Later, ladies. D1",

For example, mine are a tightening in my lower back, right on top of my butt.  They kinda ripple and when they're really bad, I have them in waves to the beat of my heart and will travel up my spine, across my shoulder blades.  They seem to be aggravated by activity and then come on strong when I sit back down.  They appear on Day 8 after infusion, Day 6 after neulasta shot.  I manage them by laying around and using the heating pad. I'd like to see if we have some sort of trend here.  My onc claims this cannot possibly be a se associated with anything I'm taking, but I've never had this before tx and they appear on exactly the same day every time.  I'm suspecting they're linked to the neulasta shot, but if we see a different pattern, I'm willing to be proved wrong. Thank you for participating in my empirical study. D1 (mad scientist)",

I have to be quick.  Been forgetting to share with you guys that college girl is coming home this weekend and I'm supposed to leave in 3 mins (!!!) to start the drive and I haven't even showered, yet!  Yikes!  (Oh, but if I'm a little MIA this weekend, you'll know I'm basking in the love of having my family all under one roof again.) Vettegal--loved the valentine!  Thinking of you right now--bet you're still with your doc... Sista2/PALady/Paula--thanks for sharing your back stories.  I'm going to arm myself with all of our experiences the next time I see my onc because he needs to acknowledge this is something real.  If there's anyone else, please pile on (I hope there isn't).  If you all will keep me updated if your bad days change/don't exist, I'd appreciate it.  For me, the spasms are on Day 6 after neulasta (shot day is day 1) like clockwork.  That's too much coincidence for me not to think there isn't a link. Hey Carol, by the time you figure out the Miralax you'll be done!!  hehe.  That's such exciting news about your stepdaughter.  I \"awwed\" out loud (is that aol?  naw, that's something else,  now, isn't it?) when I read it. Julie, girl, you rock the FUBC shirt.  And look at you all up in your chemo chair with a pink doo-rag!  Minimal se's, minimal se's... CarolC--Oh man, I hear you on the neuropathy issues.  Mine have only affected my hands so far--can't imagine the feet!  Hope those drugs help.  I also laughed at your askew wig comment.  Last night I was at dd's basketball game talking to a parent from the other team (my kid went to AAU Nationals with her dd when they were 10 years old, so we have lots to catch up on when our high schools play each other.  Oh, and I'll brag--that year her team came in 4th in the Nation!!!).  Anyway, I'm chatting away and for some reason patted the top of my head--only to discover that my wig had ridden up and was actually perched on my beanhead!  My bangs came down about an inch when I did it!  (And this mom didn't know about my bc!)  The dh saw it happen and laughed and said, \"Nice hair.\"  We all lol and then I told the mom.  Guess I should wear that tape they gave me, but I HATE the whole wig thing so much, I think it's my protest not to wear it properly! Sheebas--Good to hear from you.  Sorry the past 2 weeks haven't been so great.  Try to enjoy your good days.  Vacuuming is an idea.  I kept toying with getting those cold wax strips and waxing the hair off! Congrats to Auntie KathyL!!!  February is a GREAT birthday month! You will NOT believe (I'm still in shock) what my dh gave me for valentine's day!  A gift certificate for a massage!!!  He said he thought I'd want one when I'm done with all of this.  How extravagant!  I'm psyched! oh man, g2g!!! Good luck today Vettegal, Peg1212, Jenny, PALady, Paula, Deb and WVgirl.  Have it shaken, not stirred!  FUBC!!!!!!! D1",

Sounds like we have a little bug going around.  First KathyL, then LJ13, now Deb and CHJ.  Stay on top of the temps, you guys.  I think we've all been drilled by our docs that temps are no laughing matter for us.  LJ13 that was EXACTLY the right thing to call your doc.  Do NO guilt for that--it's his job.  Please remember to keep your fluids up when you're not feeling well, too.  And get rid of those cooties! Kris--Oh man, I'm so sorry you're having the back pain, too.  That makes 6 of us here alone.  (How can this not be related to our tx?)  When I'm in serious spasm mode I do find a LITTLE relief if I lay on my back and draw my knees to my chest (I have to hold my knees in place with my arms).  Of course, this position constricts the bladder and you'll feel an urgency to relieve yourself, the act of which will redouble the spasms... (its the whole vicious circle thing). Vettegal--oh my.  Tx2 was the worst so far for me, too.  Body aches and pains so bad I couldn't move without holding the walls for support.  I lived on Max Strength Tylenol, which, if it was lessening the pain, I don't want to know how I would've felt without it.  Keep reminding yourself that it will pass (it will).  Keep your eye on the long term.  Keep Vetteguy closeby for those murmurs of support and love.  You will get through it.  You will get through it. KathyL--I'm not really doing anything for my nails.  Should I be? Wing--I second KathyL's comment that you're way better a baldicious babe than they are hair whores.  Biotches! Therese--no shame in feeling good!  Celebrate it!!  We all take turns and no one here, no one, begrudges anyone else their good day.  Just stay away from those sickies in your house!  Oh, and I so totally understand what you mean about hearing family noise and finding that comforting.  It's one of the things in life that bring me the most pleasure, too. So we have a Jewel break tomorrow.  Let's all shake our se's, respiratory infections, whatever and celebrate! D1",

Carol--thanks for the comiseration on the bball thing.  My dd is handling it well (although she has some serious backne going on, so I know she's stressed), but we're ready for the high school season to be over.  And wouldn't you know, Vassar just sent her a letter this week interested in having her play ball for them...  (and we have no tapes from this year!).  Stupid coach.  Anyway, the skating thing sounds exciting.  I always watch it on the Olympics cause it's not only fast, but you can tell there's some strategy going on.  Have a great time and keep blinking so your contacts don't cloud up! Hip hooray, KathyL!  Two potties for the ds!  Is he getting the hang of it??  Those big boy panties are just around the corner!  Have a great time at your purse party, it sounds like fun. Hey SIS Kimberly, we're pulling you outta the se fog!  Hang in there, girl.  Thinking about you. So, Vettegal, time to put a cork in it. Good luck with the se's, Tinalee.  Lurk away, but if you need to vent, you know where to come. Therese--gosh darn it.  You need to shake those URI's!  Take it easy, would ya? Happy day after birthday, Julie! LJ13--I agree with KathyL, have them watch you, or take your dp in to watch you, when you get your 2nd tx of Taxol.  Several of us had no problem with the first one, but the second literally took our breath away.  You'll need to have a slow drip, and/or (I'd go with and) someone to stick with you to call for help if you have a reaction.  And if you don't have a reaction, you'll have some company! Yay Jenny, sounds like you made it through tx2!  Oh, and not sure if you watch Gossip Girl, but the XOXO at the end of your post reminded me of that show and made me smile. (You can tell I have a teenager in my house by the tv we watch!) Ah Dana, keep that fighting spirit and positive attitude!  You got it going on, girl! So I'm using the tea tree oil on my nails (stinky stuff).  But today my right pinkie and my left ring finger are turning a dark red/purple.  And it hurts to put pressure on any of them (ie when I removed sheets today, it was quite painful to grasp the fitted sheet to take it off).  I'm hoping they'll just turn color and hurt, not fall off.  I wish I didn't have any more tx to aggravate this... Also, while I'm complaining, my node incision has been painful for a week or so.  It just aches and aches.  It felt better after my le massage, but now it hurts again.  I think I need to have my le specialist move in with me so I can get massage several times a day (dh would probably like that, too, she's a cute little 20-something)!  After each of my tx's I've noticed that it hurts for a few days, but this time it lasted longer.  Thank goodness I only have one tx left!  My poor bod isn't going to completely bounce back before this final one.  Waaaaaah. Okay, enough complaining.  I'm going to take advantage of my good weekend and see about hitting a lighting store to get some new outdoor lights for our garage.  The ones we have are dead and the dh has finally agreed with me that we need new ones.  Have to get him to the store before he changes his mind!  :) Onward, Jewels!

      "Content": "Feb 27, 2008 07:09PM Determined1 wrote: I'm baaaaack!  Tx was the shortest to date--I was only there 5 hours.  I do not see my onc again till May 21!!!!  I'm going to consult with his rads guy at Georgetown Hospital and also the rad dept at Arlington Hospital, which is 7 minutes from my house (G'town is 30-45 minutes, depending on traffic).  I'm going to do whatever makes me most comfortable (factoring in the commute for 6 1/2 weeks, of course). Onc is quite disturbed by my cording.  He says that's likely that's what it is (the stuff in my le arm), but he wants me to go in on Friday when I get my nasty-lasta and be worked in for an ultrasound to rule out the possibility of a blood clot.  I like that he's conservative.  Much rather get it checked than carry merrily on and have a problem down the road.  He said after rads he'll take care of my HT, too.  Guess we'll be friends for a while. Good news was we discussed my se's from last time and he agreed to take the Avitan out of my tini today.  I'm not nearly as loopy this time--although the Benedryl still makes me sleepy.  Hoping it will help me sleep through the night cause I sure didn't get much sleep-eye last night!  My chemo nurse examined my fingernails and she thinks I stand a good chance to keep them because the nails are not thickening or curving upward.  She said they'll turn blacker with this tx, but in time they will grow out and be okay.  She recommended nail polish to cover it up.  So that's irritating, (still feels like I'm pressing on a bruise all the time--even when I'm not touching my nails!  And opening bottles, picking my nose, and other daily activities really hurt.  I won't miss this.), but not as dire as I'd thought. So, it's done then.  I have to get through my se's and by Friday the 7th, I should be among the living and moving on--it does not seem possible!  I still have a long road (not looking forward to meeting with my surgeon to see if I need tidying up surgery...), so I'll most def be around to cheer my Jewel pals on.  Not to worry. Hope KathyL and Maz are okay with their tx's... Carol, Paula, Julie and TinaLee--Thanks for your compliments on starting the Jewels, but all I did was begin the thread.  It is ALL of us who have made the Jewel Experience what it is.  We are bound in ways none of us ever expected and I hope and pray we'll be able to maintain our bond for many, many years to come.  Humbly, I don't have a clue what I would've done without all of you.  Thanks for being there and participating in this journey as Sisters in Survival. Carol--WTF!  A ticket and you didn't pull the cancer card?  Goodness girl, I've gotten out of three parking garages without paying since I've been bald--and twice I handed the ticket and the money over together and the attendant gave me my money back.  The cop might've been being nice to you, but you need to play your card, girl! Vettegal--Yes for me to both heartburn and no sleep.  The first bout I had with the heartburn made me think I was surely dying.  Luckily the dh and college girl both have acid reflux (maybe luckily is the wrong word, but you know what I mean), and immediately prescribed Pepcid AC to me.  I only take it once a day, at about 5p and it really helps.  After reading that others take it twice, I think I'll try that--I'm always wary of taking too many drugs, but the Pepcid will make a huge difference and I agree I deserve relief all day long!  Sleep sucks, too.  Hot flashes mostly awaken me.  I'll have 15 to 20 of them in an average night and have to throw off the covers.  A tylenol PM can give me about 4 hours of sleep in a row, so I think you're on the right track with that.  I figure 4 hours is better than nothing... Paula--love your self medicating with the \"old fashioned\" remedy!  So glad it worked. CHJ--You probably still could have used the cancer card at the funeral, but it sounds like the cold issues were keeping you and the dh outta play that day.  Best to just go home and rest.  When you feel up to it, a card and a casserole for his family will make you feel better and like you participated.  SIS Kimberly--so glad you had a good time at the concert.  I've heard the Piano Man puts on a good show.  And I'm also glad to see you're filling your dance card again--means you're feeling better.  Just take care not to overdo, our SHERO. WVgirl--sometimes you just gotta cry for the release-don't beat yourself up.  In fact, if this is persistent for you, I want you to call your doc tomorrow and tell them what's going on.  You have so many stressors in your life right now that it may be time for some chemical help.  Please think about it. Well, the gas is already kicking in and I'm grossing out my dd, who is doing some major PMSing (her bball team has qualified for regional semifinals, which is exciting, but she's not playing; she was just named co-editor of the yearbook for next year and is now having to go to school early and stay late to interview applicants for staff positions for next year; she has the SAT test on Sat. and is frantic trying to prepare; she's fighting off a cold; her mommy had tx today and she knows she's going to have to pitch in more than her share for the next week; she has a big English paper due soon; and she's getting her period.  And I think I have it bad.).  So I must get out the Lysol spray to camouflage my digestive distress (already took some GasX, but it doesn't seem to be working) and calm my dd's grossout factor.  The things we do. Onward, Jewels! D1",

I'm so fried I can't think or move.  We'll get there. Hey Wendy, good to hear from you.  Hope tomorrow goes well.  Last one!!! Can't wait to see pics from the dance, KathyL.  Sounds like you had a sweet time--even with the dd telling everyone you were wearing a wig. Interesting to hear others are having trouble with their ear piercings.  I wasn't sure if it was something related to chemo or not (altho I blame everything on chemo these days).  Hopefully, it will clear up soon. I'm off to my dd's winter sports awards night.  Since she didn't play much this season, we're not expecting any athletic awards.  She will, however, receive an award from the state for maintaining above a 3.5 GPA during the season (they should give her a special award for maintaining a 4.3 during the season--thanks to AP classes).  It'll be a little boring to sit through, but only this one and next year and then I'm done with that!

Oh, and I hear you, my friend, about the face peering back from the mirror.  It's not me.  Some bald, pale (sallow?), puffy faced creature has taken over my body.  We had a family picture taken at Thanksgiving of 2006 and I really don't even look like that person anymore.  But the way I look at it (when I'm having a positive moment) is that I get a fresh canvas.  I can create whatever physically beautiful person I want to when I'm done with this.  Sure, I get impatient waiting to begin my work, but I know someday soon I'll get my chance.  In the meantime, I'm trying really hard to adjust to a new definition of beauty and trying to enjoy all the breaks my \"cancer look\" gives me when waiting in lines, or paying the parking attendants (I've gotten out of garages 4 times so far for free!).  And for those who don't find the cancer patient still beautiful--f*ck 'em if they can't take a joke. LWDana--thanks, girlfriend, for reminding me to recommend my favorite Trader Joe's product--their Grapefruit Body Scrub.  I only use it once a week, but it really hydrates my skin and smells good to boot.  I'll have to look for the mandarin orange one--I'm drawn to the citrus smells, particularly in warmer weather. SIS Kimberly--stay away from digestive distress this time!!!  I'll bet you have all your remedies lining the kitchen counter--don't forget to take them before the symtoms appear (you know they're gonna appear, may as well be preventative, ya know?). Oh, and there's NO WAY I'm making my curtains!!!  I'm totally challenged when it comes to hand crafts.  I'm just picking out the fabric (with WAY too much familial input) and I'll take them to a local curtain making shop.  They made our curtains 14 years ago and the fabric is literally rotting off the walls.  I was supposed to do something about it as my back-to-school project last fall, but I got distracted...  I'm just totally psyched about the makeover, though.  We've hired a painter to paint the rooms (we're doing the ceilings, too, this time, so I told the dh he was off the hook), and then new curtains.  Urban renewal!! Oh PALady, I found my last one to be the worst, too (KathyL, I hope you've stopped reading this).  I think part of the problem was that I'd lost patience with the whole se thing and was ready to move on.  I'd been very careful not to count a tx done till I was past the se's for every one before, but that last one, well, let's just say I'd lost it.  Now that I'm coming around, I'm finding my attitude is improving, so hopefully you will experience the same. Wendy, Wendy, Wendy!  Many congrats on finishing your course of AC.  May your se's be few and mild. Off to fix dins for my dd--she starts AAU basketball practice tonight, so has to eat early to avoid tummy trouble. TTFN. D1",

When we're ready for Oprah, we need to coordinate ourselves to start a letter writing campaign.  I'm not big into Oprah (mostly cause I don't watch tv during the day), but I like how she inspires folks, so I'm all over the bc awareness message we have to send.  You can count on me for whatever (I like to write--good use of my time). Paula--your ds is right--girls like the longer hair.  I don't, but I'm too old to count in his eyes.  But as a mom of two teen girls, yep, the long hair.  Besides, he's a pretty handsome dude.  Don't sweat the hair.  You look awesome, btw.  I always thought you resembled a woman in a commercial for zantac (or some drug, sorry can't remember, but every time I see it I think of you). LWDana--Oh yeah, I've seen the tangerine scrub.  Good stuff, huh?  Maybe I'll have to give up the grapefruit to give it a try.  Isn't the tangerine a sugar scrub?  (The grapefruit is salt.)  And yes, it does make the shower slippery. Oh Carol, have a bm and think of me!  (You can decide if that means bloody mary or bowel movement.)  Okay, we're a totally sick group of women!!!  :)  (Or maybe I'm just the sick one...)  Get that damn pooper under control, girl! Don't spill the beans on Idol, KathyL.  I've got it tivo'd.  (Can't stand to watch reality tv with commercials.)  I'll watch the singing and then the elimination back-to-back.  All I know is, little David Arch-angel forgot his words.  Too young for the Beatles songbook, I guess.  Should've been my kid.  My girls went to sleep every night to Beatles music.  Either I sang it, or we played a tape.  (I don't sing much--well--but I like the Beatles, and Fleetwood Mac and Pink Floyd and the Eagles, hmmm, I could go on...) Okay, so my dh has been really, really busy with work for a few weeks now.  Really stressed.  Not getting home till 10pm.  Sick with whatever.  For the first night, he's home by 8:30 to eat with us.  Well, eat with me and college girl (dd had bball practice and I fed her earlier--see my post).  He walks in and pulls stuff out of his pockets and see a receipt and asks himself aloud, hmm, what's this for?  Then remembers he has a gift for me.  He toddles off and returns with a box.  Tells me he's proud of me for getting through chemo without too much complaining (good thing he doesn't read my posts here!).  I open the box to find a pair of teardrop lemon topaz earrings!!!  Must've set him back.  They're absolutely beautiful!  Even with my crusty red ear, I'm cleaning them up and wearing them tomorrow (and the next day and the next day...).  Not sure what got in to him, but I'm so touched.  (And thank God for the chemo weepies as I was able to produce genuine tears for him, which made him very happy.  Why do guys like girls who cry???)  Anyway, I'll wear them when we get together so you can admire.  And here's my family photo from November 2006 (reference my previous shout out to KathyL).  It's college girl, me, dh and dd. Take care of yourself, Sheshe.  You're amazing in my book. I hear you, Jenn.  Thanks. Oh, man, after all that nice stuff I wrote about the dh and the earrings, he just came in to say goodnight to me and I blew him off when I was concentrating on the picture.  Now he's all upset.  Gotta go make him feel appreciated.  (When do I get to teach him the le massage???  You know, my new foreplay plan.  Honestly.)

Paula--I like your positive, aggressive approach to your tx.  Here's hoping your counts stay up so you stay on schedule and get to your rads on time. Therese--Oh yeah.  I hear your chemo brain.  (You had me lol with those stories, girl.)  I'm having the weirdest mind farts myself, lately.  I'll be mid conversation and completely blank out on the next word.  My family (if I'm talking to them) look at me with faces of shock/amusement and let me flounder for what seems like a million years before they blurt out the word I seek.  They think its funny.  Urgh.  Don't feel bad about sending your kid to school with strep--my rule is if you're not dead, you go to school (unless they looked positively contagious).  They're surviving.  Although I'm still living down the time my kid broke her arm and instead of taking her straight to the ER I came home because I was in the middle of printing a big report for a client and needed to make sure it got out before COB that day, so my kid had to cool her jets for a few hours while I got my report done and THEN we went to the ER.  One of my better mom moments.  Hope your kid gets well soon and is able to enjoy her spring break. You know, I didn't even put 2 and 2 together about my swelling issues.  Of course its that darn taxotere.  I wonder how long it will take before we're set free of our se's?  Thanks for the tips LJ13. WVgirl--hip hooray for those co-workers!  Flowers and a poem--how wonderful.  Oh, and I'm with Carol, please ask your doc about those spots on your thyroid--the peace of mind is so important. Oh yeah, Julie, no vomitus!!!  But a blackout???  Be careful, girlfriend. Oh man, Carol, so sorry to hear about your digestive distress at work.  Maybe they should move you to an office with a private toilet for a few months...  Um, yeah, corned beef and SAUERKRAUT will bring on the sharts!....  Yay about your insurance covering your sleeve.  I picked mine up on Friday and am going to try it on Monday at the gym per my legu's suggestion.  I will say my new fugly compression garment seems to be working--although its not one of my faves to be bound up all day.  Glad to hear you felt well enough to take one of your weiners out for a stroll.  I did some yardwork today with the dh and now I'm totally wiped out.  Gonna make myself a drink and crash on the sofa when I'm done here. Tinalee--I agree with you about our tx schedules dovetailing.  Its nice to always have a few of us out of the fog to prop up those feeling their way through it.  Too bad we won't both be cheering for the Vikes, but the Vikes/Packers games next season will be fun.  (Are you guys gonna be okay without Farve?  Course, we haven't had a QB in ages...) LJ13--Thanks, as always, for the info on diet and iron.  We eat quite healthfully in our house, but there's always room for improvement.  I'm going to see if I can incorporate some of your ideas. Well, dh and college girl are making noise while watching some college hoops on tv and I wanna check it out.  Tomorrow I'll be all day with my dd at AAU basketball, so not sure if I'll be able to check in--don't post too, too much, as it can be intimidating to read and respond to so many posts!!!  (Reference Julie's 3 hour marathon!) Stay well and keep sparklin' Jewels! D1",

      "Content": "Mar 17, 2008 07:16PM Determined1 wrote: It IS intimidating to miss a day around here, I agree with CarolC (so good to hear from you!).  Yesty was really hectic.  Dd had 5 bball games scheduled (okay, not full games, more like scrimmages.  They use a 25 min. running clock, but no timeouts.  The kids literally run non-stop for 25 minutes!).  She started out rusty (too much time on the pine during her high school season), but improved with each game.  An old coach of hers from several years ago even picked her up for another game because he only had 5 girls and needed a sub.  So my kid agreed to play thinking she'd spell the other girls.  Nope.  The coach started her and played her for all but 3 mins!  My kid was good, though, only took a couple of shots, but spent most of the time feeding the girls who are on the team (one thing my kid can do is get the ball to the open player).  The coach and parents were thrilled with her unselfish play and even came over to tell me so.  She was happy to be back on the court. Like some others around here, I spent some time outside on Sat. with the dh pruning (more like hacking away) some shrubs that were out of control.  Hopefully they won't all die after the dh's TLC--NOT!  It was nice, though, at first he tried to live w/i my supervision, but then he told me he found my desire to keep the buds on some things for flowering this season a little constricting and asked permission to be more aggressive.  How could I deny him the opportunity to chop away his frustrations?  So, we have a bunch of sticks poking out of the ground where we once had bushes.  We'll see if nature can overcome my dh! KathyL--you know, I'm noticing more swelling, too.  The sausage visual when you take off your socks was all too familiar.  And my face is just awful--lids swollen and face rounder.  I'm trying to look on the good side--fine lines and wrinkles have disappeared!!  I do hope this goes away soon.  Sounds like you'll be ready for Easter--don't stress it.  Dh will be there to pick up the slack.  LWDana--uh oh.  Nothing like a woman with PMS!  And one doing chemo to boot!  Musta been UGLY!  I agree, no wonder you went off.  Sounds like everyone has given you all the back pain remedies I've used.  Hope you're able to shake it.  Hang in there. Paula you're sounding better and better.  So glad the cough finally let up.  That's been dogging you for months! TinaLee--How good to see you at long last!!  Love the pics.  (BTW, you must be my barber, too, my hair resembles the cuts you and Dave have!) Julie--Well, I followed the progress of your migrane over the past couple of days.  So glad it finally went away.  You need to remember to tell your onc about that because you shouldn't have to deal with that on top of everything else.  And it was so heartwarming to read about your faculty and staff.  How wonderful it is to be appreciated!  I'm so happy for you. Carol--Good for you for getting out on the course yesterday.  And then topping it off with king crab for dinner!  I'm jealous!! Welcome KathyN!  I see everyone gave you all of my suggestions for dry mouth, so I have nothing to add except to say drop in any time! Glad you're supporting the vol fire dept., WVgirl.  We don't thank those folks often enough. Jenn--I was happy that you took time off from the thread to enjoy your family.  And from looking at your pix, I can see why you'd want to--it's a good looking bunch who clearly love you.  Oh, and you can go with the wig or with the balditude--you look great either way. CarolC--It was so good to hear from you.  I'm so sorry you've been struggling with depression and was pleased to see that you're going to see a therapist for some help.  Depression is quite common for cancer patients and its not healthy to let it fester unchecked.  There are so many things that can be done to alleviate it.  Please take care of yourself and check in whenever you want.  We're always here for you. Deb--I had trouble with my hands itching like mad after my first tx with the Taxotere and used Sarna lotion to help.  I just kept slathering it on.  It would make the itchies go away for about 20 mins and then when I couldn't take it anymore, I'd apply some more.  Try to keep your hands out of hot water--that seemed to make mine worse.  It stopped itching after about 7-10 days and I haven't had a problem with that since.  Hope yours clears up soon. Vettegal--Doggone that whole period thing!  Like you don't have enough se's!  Mention it to your onc.  Hey, I have peach fuzz, too.  You can only see my hair when I'm backlit.  I call the color Arctic White (it's like no color at all).  Mine is also straight and some are 3/4\" long.  I just don't have much, yet.  It started coming back after tx 2 a little bit and then took off after tx3.  I'm hoping it continues to grow!  Oh, and my family wants me covered when we go out in public, too.  I'm complying with their wishes because this is hard on them, too, and its no skin off my teeth to tie on a doo-rag.  I know I could be more rebelious about it, but I'm choosing not to argue this one if it makes them more comfortable.  I do go topless around the house... Oh man, gotta get on dinner.  Later. D1",

Got my MRI today (had to be done with contrast, so another IV.  I was not happy, but managed to survive).  I have a copy of it on a CD, which I'll have to take over to G'town tomorrow, I guess. Thinking about CathyCA in the lounge today.  Sorry you're all by yourself in the bar, but we're there in spirit!  You asked about when I noticed aches and pains.  They started during my recovery from chemo tx4.  I've noticed that I can't do as much at the gym (even as much as I was doing just days before my tx) and my body feels like its my first day back at the gym every single day with the muscle soreness.  I'm still pushing myself to go on my old schedule, even if I don't work myself as hard.  I don't understand why it seems to be so difficult to get back to my previous levels this time (I was bouncing back in between all my other txs), but I'm trying to be patient.  From what I've been told, its going to get more difficult as I get into rads.  Oh joy. Hey Carol, sounds like the cation is going swimmingly (tried out that floater hoot, yet?).  Hope that Pinot Gris tickled your taste buds.  I just had one last week and was so delighted to realize that I could taste/enjoy it. Julie--it sounds like you had a busy, but happy Easter.  Hopefully, you saw the last of the snow flurries for the year!  As for what my onc plans for me, well, right now I've been passed over to babydoc for rads.  He's ordered the CT scan and MRI, which I've recently mentioned, but I think those are primarily for his rad-reasons.  I'll see my onc again in Mid-May--after rads.  At that time we'll be discussing HT or other options, if they appy to me.  Don't know much beyond that. Deb--I know you're anxious to get through the taxotere, but the change to every 3 weeks may help with the neuropathy.  I found I really needed the time to recover and have some \"feel good\" days between txs.  Interestingly, I still have numb fingertips from the taxotere and I'm almost 4 weeks out from my last tx.  I think you'll be better off with the extra time.  I really like the thoughts on courage--it rings true. Maz--when I read your post I couldn't help but think that your thoughts are EXACTLY what Val needs right now.  That and the fact that she knows you're there when she needs you.  Hang in there, and stick to the \"mild side,\" (with those se's, that is). Paula--Topless in church??!!  Scandalous!!!!!! PALady--Glad to hear you had a happy time in Vegas (is what you did there, staying there???).  When I read about your swelling I had exactly the same thoughts as SIS Kimberly.  Oh and join the darkening nails club.  Seems the TC crowd is getting that one.  They kinda hurt, don't they?  That does get better, the only ones that are hurty on me now are the ones that are discolored and only when I press on them.  The one nail I have that was bleeding out is developing a \"deeper\" white part at the top.  You know how when you accidentally jab something between your nail and finger and then you end up with a deeper dip in your white part?  Well, that's what I have where it bled out.  I'm hoping that doesn't bode poorly for my nails' future...  So how did your rad simulation go? Joan--Hip hooray that you were able to taste your Easter meal!!!  (We celebrate the strangest things around here, don't we??) SIS Kimberly--I want to be invited to your Easter egg hunt next year.  Cash prizes are right up my alley!!!  (So glad to have you back.) Oh KathyL!!!  Go on a date with your spouse!  You guys need it. Not much on the agenda tonight--just waiting till its late enough for me to take off my compression bra and set my gals free!!!! D1",

Hey Jenn, just do what you can and don't push.  Too many of us are learning that the hard way. WVgirl--Grrrrrrr.  Months??!! So it sounds like you're back to your busy schedule, SIS Kimberly.  Although the getaway to Tahoe sounds just great.  Oh, and yes, it's a compression bra and it does defeat the purpose.  I run around like a stuffed sausage these days and count the hours till I can take it off.  It is, however, moving the fluid out, so it's working.  I'm bummed and happy about that at the same time. PALady--OMG, I've had to stop using the treadmill altogether because the pain in the fronts of my shins was excrutiating!  Oh, and I have one tattoo so far.  I'm supposed to get 2-3 more.  You know me, I'm really looking forward to that! So, I get a call from the rad dept today to reschedule my start date.  I was supposed to start this Thursday at noon, but babydoc wants more time to review my test results.  I told the scheduler that I was going to swing by the hospital later to drop off the CD with my MRI pix on it for him.  So, I toddled over to G'town this afternoon to drop off the CD and to give babydoc's nurse an order for more le tx for him to sign.  While I was there, babydoc came down the hallway and asked me if I had a few and could wait to talk with him for a minute.  You bet I can talk!  So I waited.  'Bout 5 mins later he sticks his head into the hallway and motions for me to come on down.  Turns out they found a cyst under my left (bad) armpit on the CT scan I had done last Thursday.  Babydoc will not start rads if there's anything in my body that shows up on my scans (he said rads take care of the things you can't see--surgery gets the stuff you can see).  He wants to check w/ some surgeon pals of his to see if it can be drained or if I need to have it removed.  He suggested that when he gets his answer I head back to my surgeon to have whatever done.  I told him I'm not going back to my surgeon anymore and I told him why.  (I even gave him the story from college girl where she said  that my surgeon was seeing 17 bc patients a day but I'm the only one that matters to her and she wants my docs to treat me that way.  Then I told babydoc I picked him to be my radonc because he made me feel like I was his only patient--a little sucking up.  I said that my surgeon didn't have time for me, so I don't want to go back.)  So, babydoc said he'd try to find me a surgeon among his friends, but he warned me that surgeons are strange and don't like to clean up others' messes (he used more diplomatic language, but that was the gist).  I'm hoping he can find someone else.  And I'm hoping that when this cyst thing is removed I'll get some relief under my arm (still hurts to put it by my side).  He seems to think it will help.  Bad news is that my rads are being pushed back.  Long story to tell you all that I'm on hold for now.  I really want to just get on with it... I think maybe I should whip up KathyL's brownie recipe and try some bribery to get this show on the road! Oh, I'm so distracted.  Dd seems to want to chat and I can't multitask anymore, so I'm going to sign off and listen to her.  Teens don't feel like chatting often, so I want to take advantage of the opportunity.  Later.

Headed off for my first experience with rads in a couple of hours.  I think I might be excited.  (You know, I think we just lose touch with reality when we go through this because we get all bent when we delay tx, even though we know tx will bring yucky stuff with it.  Luckily, rad tx isn't supposed to be as bad as other tx's we've done...)  I am a little nervous about the 2-3 more tattoos I'll get today, but I'm trying to push those thoughts from my mind.  I'll let you all know how it goes. Hey Tinalee, I forgot to mention in my last shouts that I'm joining the \"call your credit card company\" chorus.  And by all means, play the cancer card.  You're not holding that one in your hand for no reason, you know... Paula (aka banana boobs)--I sure hope those acheys and tinglies are passing.  You know its okay to do some crabbing here when you're not feeling on top of your game.  We all take a good turn at that! KathyL--oh my!  A big boy bed!  I sure remember that transition for both my girls.  Like your ds, they were excited about the change--if only they'd been as jazzed about potty-training... Hey, do you have any ideas for hanging onto fingernails?  I've had 3 of them bleed out from under the nail on me, now and the ring finger on my right hand looks suspiciously like its rising up off my finger.  Do you think if I wrap bandaids around them that would help?  Or would a moist environment make it worse?  Suggestions are most welcome. CarolC--WTF is going on at your (former) workplace?  Those folks need a long walk off a short dock.  Keep your head up and teach them a little something. You mentioned the muscular achiness.  After my 4th tx, I developed achiness from my hips to my toes.  It hurts to stand from a seated position.  It hurts to flex my ankles.  It just hurts.  Feels like I just went back to the gym after taking off many weeks and my muscles are rebelling.  The problem is, I've been a regular at the gym, so I know that's not it.  I've had this problem for more than 3 weeks now.  I think CathyCA & Therese are having the same trouble, if I remember correctly.  Right now, I'm not doing anything about it.  Just waiting it out.  If you come up with a solution, let me know. Hey Therese, you could be describing me one month out from tx4.  Just add the bleeding fingernails to the list!  I do agree with your assessment that energy is better every day.  Even though I've got a bunch of niggling issues, I'm able to handle it all much better because I have more energy.  Keep hanging in there. Jenn--Hooray for Outback!!  Sounds like the frozen 'rita must've cooled off the burned mouth!  ;) Maz--hope you're building in rest time for you.  You need time to regroup so your body can get to work on getting those counts back up. Good luck to SIS Kimberly and Carol tomorrow.  I imagine the two of you will live it up in the lounge.  (Or, maybe SIS Kimberly will get her April Fool's wish and the lounge will be closed...) Till later! D1",

So I saw my legu today, who felt my fluid was building up a little on my side.  We brainstormed what could be the problem and came up with 3 ideas--1) the tattoos are near the fluidy area and bled excessively, maybe trauma?, 2) I was not wearing kinesio tape on my side in case it would be in the way of what the rad techs needed to do, maybe my lymph system has become dependent on the road map it offers?, or 3) the pain in my arm from lifting over my head could be causing some swelling.  We may never know the true culprit, but we're redoubling our efforts to get it down again.  I really hope none of you develops le to this point.  It's really a PITA.  Luckily, the odds should be in your favor as only 5% of lymph node surgery patients develop it and I'm happy to take the bullet for the Jewels--as long as you let me complain about it!  :) Learned something new today--they shoot rads at me from 2 angles, one directly on my breast and the other from under my arm area.  I noticed that the shot to my armpit is a lot longer, so I asked why.  Seems that it takes longer for the rays to penetrate muscle mass (I wouldn't describe myself that way, but whatever), so the machine has to be on longer when directed at areas with muscle.  Made sense to me.  Sorta.  I warned them that I would ask a lot of questions, and they were receptive (course I took cookies in today...).  I'll share with you guys. Jenn--OMG and LOL at your flooding story!!  Good thing it was only a few gallons!  And YAY on the nap. Not sure what you mean by needle placement.  Is that the procedure where they inserted the guide wire into my boob?  That was BY FAR the worst procedure I've endured.  Getting a tattoo is NOWHERE near that!  The tats probably compare to a novocaine injection before you get a big needle.  It doesn't penetrate the skin deeply at all, lasts a few secs and burns for a sec.  Really, the first one I got was the worst, because I didn't know what to expect.  You'll have a leg-up (I hope) from all my long-winded descriptions (apologies to those not doing rads). Hey Paula, thanks for the testimonial from your friend, Pam, on applying the lotion.  It encourages me to keep slathering it on.  I'm so glad you're finding the se pain more tolerable on Taxol.  You really deserve a break. Carol--You'll have to fill me in on the retreat.  There was an article recently in The Post about one in the area and it sounded intriguing, but maybe too touchy feely for me.  Plus, it's a week-long deal.  But tell us about your experience, I'm curious about it.  (I don't think I could EVER leave that dog for more than 5 minutes--he's just darling!!) Boy, SIS Kimberly, you're sounding awfully lucid for one expecting a fog bank.  Hope it's mighty thin this time and lifts quickly.  (My dh won't watch DWTS with me, either, so I TIVO and view on my own time, too.  He loves Gossip Girl, though, go figure.) Big day at the bar tomorrow--it'll be sparkling with all our Jewels!  AZDonna, Deb, Tinalee and Sunshine (last one--YIPPEE), go kick some cancer butt!!!  FUBC! For you sapphires in the fog--turn on your foglights and follow our voices outta there!  We're all pulling for ya! Off to watch the boob tube (hmmm, maybe a different slang term will be more appropriate, given the current circumstances). TTFN, D1",

Want to revisit my orientation.  We spent a lot of time talking about hair loss--probably the least threatening of the se's, but the one everyone identifies with cancer.  Anyway, the nurse is asking me if I'd like a list of wig stores or if I wanted to wear scarves and I realized that I really don't know how I want to handle baldness.  I mean, I know it's going to happen, but I think I'm in a bit of denial and not thinking about it.  Strange for me--I'm usually so anal-retentive and the one with the to do list.  Maybe I'll be ready to deal with this as the time nears, but for right now (as in this minute) I'm content to not plan for it.  Too much other stuff swirling in my head (and the holidays don't help that one bit!). One thing I found interesting last night--no two things.  First, I'm not supposed to clean up after my dog while on chemo.  So that means either the dog doo just decomposes around my neighborhood (I can still walk her), or I have to find someone to tag along and be my pooper scooper!  Hmm.  There might be money in that.  After my recovery, maybe I should start a business to pick up dog doo.  But then what do I tell people I do for a living when I'm at cocktail parties???? Other thing I found interesting.  If I get a temp over 100 degrees I'm supposed to head straight to the emergency room.  And when I get there, march to the sign in and tell them I'm an oncology patient and they have to give me a private room immediately.  I dunno.  That sounded so grave to me.  And kinda entitling--if I need it. Okay, I gotta get off to set up the snack bar for my high school basketball game for tonight.  I'm the president of our Booster club and unlike a guy president (who would simply direct others), I don't ask anyone to do anything I wouldn't first do myself.  So I'm off to demonstrate so that when I'm feeling like doo-doo (my theme for today) I can ask others to step up with a clean conscience.  Girls are so strange, aren't we?

Okay, so I start reading our thread and SIS Kimberly has me in tears (I'm not a crier) with the poem.  Then there's Vettegal's post (thankfully edited) which has me boo-hooing out loud.  And then the excitement of Kathy's new bras, and LJ13 sailing through this, Carol's drinking like a fish, I can't handle it! First of all, Kathy, I'd be most grateful if you could put together a calendar for us.  I was thinking I should get to that, but I feel like shit and one thing I'm struggling to learn is that it's okay to let others do stuff--particularly since you sound all anal like me and I know you'll do it right.  :)  My dates were/are:  12/27, 1/16, 2/6 and 2/27.  For the record, I turn 50 on 2/11.  ;) Dana, welcome to our group.  The worst part about getting chemo is the anticipation.  Please take a deep breath--it'll be okay.  Cocktails are different for different types of cancer and if you have concerns, please be open with your onc about it.  He/she should be able to ease your concerns and if not, get another opinion.  It's all okay to do that.  I'll bet most of us here have done it.  Come here often, post the good and the bad stuff, we're all here to help each other. Julie, you'll be glad to be prepared.  I imagine you're at your treatment now.  Please know we're all thinking about you and sending you peace and strength.  Post when you're up for it. So I ran into this gal at my bloodwork yesterday.  She was getting her first chemo the same day as me.  I told her I recognized her and hoped it wasn't too forward of me to ask how she was doing.  She, like LJ13, felt NOTHING from the f*cking neulasta shot.  She was having some trouble with nausea, but hadn't thrown up.  I was so happy for her, but standing there with my back engulfed in spasms I think I was only able to croak out some pleasantry.  I'll have to be nicer next time, or keep to myself. So, where have you been, D1?  Why, I've been in total agony for about 24 hours!  I kept reminding myself that this is making me better while I was dropping f bombs all over a Catholic hospital yesterday.  Let me take you back.  You probably recall that I was starting to whine about back spasms in my post yesterday.  Little did I know...  After I posted I took a very hot shower, which seemed to settle my back a bit.  So the plan was my dh, college girl and I were going to drop my in-laws off at the train station for a trip they're taking, then swing by the hospital for my bloodwork and p/u the wig prescription to go wig shopping.  It was my only outing of the day and sounded okay to me (heck, it was all about me--what's not to like?).  Back is acting up a little in the car, but not too bad.  After unloading the inlaws, dh drops me off at the hospital entrance and goes to park.  I walk (I think it was 10 miles or something...) to the cancer lab.  On the way, I'm happy to run into my case nurse and ask my questions.  I'm also happy to stop walking and lean on a counter to take some pressure off my back, which is spasming more often now.  (Definition:  spasms start in the hips and move the entire length of my spine with a gripping feeling ending in the shoulderblades for good measure.  You know, why not?)  Nurse says my doc is still on vaca, so no wig rx, but that I could buy it and then submit.  Okay.  As my dh and daughter come up she's telling me what to take for heartburn, but since my escorts both suffer from acid reflux, I was happy to let them discuss tx for that while I tried to do my lamaze breathing to control my f*cking back.  Then nurse turns back to me, I focus my eyes, and she says to try Advil for my back.  I kinda went, \"huh?,\" but was trying to maintain so I said okay.  (One thing you have to know about me--I don't like people seeing me when I'm down, so I keep my exterior VERY cool.) On to the blood letting.  The hospital is trying to accommodate my irrational fear of needles, so I get my CBCs done via fingerstick.  I had to wait a few minutes for my turn--back spasming more and more.  Finally my turn.  I walk like I'm 108 years old--chat up the gal from chemo that I mentioned earlier--and settle into the chair for fingersticking.  The tech wanders off to make copies of my standing order so I have what I need the next time.  I put my head down and begin moaning as spasms occur every f-ing time my heart beats.  I'm not making this up!  Tech comes back and I try to pull it together, but find myself jumping from the spasms, so I have to tell her what's going on.  She draws the blood and the whole time I let out these horrid sounds (like a dying cow--my mom makes this noise when she's hurtin' and I'm pissed to realize that I sound like my mother).  The poor tech kept thinking it was her, but I'm assuring her, as I can breathe, that it's my back.  When the tech is done, she takes both my hands in hers and tells me in her so, so sweet Jamaican accent that no one should be in the pain I'm in.  She tells me that I'm in the hospital, that I have to talk to someone.  She pages my case nurse for me. Case nurse comes down and says without my doc, there's nothing she can do.  (What the f*ck!!!)  Tears well in my eyes.  (What the f*ck!!!)  Tears well in her eyes.  She asks me if I have any drugs from my surgeries.  I tell her Percocet.  She says to take that.  So my dh goes out to get the car and college girl helps me to a sofa near the doorway.  I totally lose it.  People stop and ask if they can help, but I can't speak--too, too much pain.  Daughter strokes my back, finds me tissues, does it all.  Also manages to tell me that I have completely soaked through my t-shirt, sweater and down jacket (Jacket is still hanging up to dry).  I somehow find this news hysterical and laugh through the tears, but guys, I was beaten. Got home, took the percocet (which is no muscle relaxant), laid on the heating pad, ate, took another percocet and went to bed.  Found that by laying flat on my back with my knees drawn up under my chin the spasms weren't so bad, but it made me have to pee.  Life's good. What I discovered is that moving stimulates the spasms, so today I'm just laying around.  I'm so bored I can't stand myself.  I can't even read the paper.  And the percocet gave me a wicked headache.  And I'm whining. So here's my action plan--I'm sending all the neulasta injections to interrogation centers around the world as any \"bad guy\" would sing like a canary to avoid what I've been through! No, in reality, I'm calling my nurse as soon as I finish my post (priorities) to demand a muscle relaxant.  And then when I see my onc next time I'm going to ask him if there's anything else I can do to keep my white blood cells up.  There's GOT to be another way.  I'm a pretty strong person, but I don't know if I can do 3 more of those shots. And for those of you scheduled to get neulasta--remember LJ13!!!  She's not having a BIT of trouble.  (You lucky duck, you!) And finally, next time, I'll try not to be so selfish with my post.  But I really needed this today. Thanks. D1",

What a difference a good night of sleep will make.  Got my muscle relaxant and took it @ 7p.  Beddy-bye at 10 (a restless waking at 4, but fell back asleep), woke up at 8.  So far I've made it downstairs and got juice and toast and no problems!  Certainly changes the outlook!  Ima go try a shower in a bit and see how that goes... Hope you're still doing okay, Diana63.  The first couple of days after chemo were okay for me, so if there's something you want to do, I say go ahead with it.  (I'm not a doctor, but I've watched them on tv...) CarolC--like you, I was 12 weeks out from my last surgery when I started chemo.  Please don't worry about the time.  They surgically removed all the cancer, the chemo is your insurance policy.  It's okay.  In fact, I took advantage of the fact that I was physically recovering and went to the gym just as much as I could before I started chemo.  I wanted to be in the best shape ever!  I'm also trying (well, I've skipped the last few days with the back spasms) to do something as I can since the tx--even if it's to walk on the treadmill set at 3.0 for a half hour.  I'm anxious to do something tomorrow if my back is okay today.  So go ahead and exercise now.  I even read something in all the propaganda they gave me that said exercise will help lessen the se's.  Now who needs more of a reason than that?  I'm not doing XT, but in the guide to se's my onc gave me, the X does not cause hair loss, but the T does.  Not sure what that'll mean for you.  (It's funny, I just looked at the drugs I'm taking and neither one causes mouth sores, but I have a mouth full of blisters, so I guess that means we should take these \"expected se's\" with a grain of salt.) Good luck today wvgirl!  We're with you in spirit!! KathyL--please don't fret over the calendar.  If it's too much, just say so.  You're in anticipation mode and it's really a stressful time.  There are lots of us here that can do the calendar (although I'm not sure how in the heck we can post it--maybe I can edit my original comment that started the thread, so it will appear at the top of the page every time?).  Get yourself through your last days at work so you can enjoy your chemo-cation! :) Sherry--I got Neulasta in the arm.  The bugger stung going in and continued to sting for almost 2 hours after.  It wasn't too bad (till the se's kicked in for me!).  And remember, LJ13 sailed through neulasta!  Maybe I'm the weirdo (wouldn't be the first time). Dana--I think it's great you're getting into nursing.  This experience will only make you a better health-care provider.  Please talk to your med team about your concerns re: germs/masks.  I plan to attend every high school basketball game for my daughter and was worried about being in the crowds.  My doc told me to take a mask with me and when the guy next to me starts coughing to give him the mask!  You're going to get through this, not to worry. Okay, off to try the shower.  Hmmm.  Maybe I'll eat some more before I head up--don't want to miss an opportunity to graze! Later, JJs. D1",

I had a lumpectomy in August.  I had a suspicious lump in my breast and the surgeon said he didn't want to leave it, even though my needle biopsy was negative.  Well, when he did the lumpectomy, it was cancer.  So I went back in for a second lumpectomy (no clean margins the first time--just like you) and a sentinel node biopsy (SNB), just to be sure the cancer hadn't spread.  (I had the choice of lumpectomy/radiation or mastectomy/reconstruction at this point and did my homework only to find that for me they were equal.  Given that, I went for the lump.)  Anyway, after the second surgery, they found that they still didn't have clean margins and I had microdots of cancer on one lymph node.  Upshot?  I get to have a third lumpectomy and the second tier of lymph nodes removed.  Third times a charm!  I will say, however, that I hope your surgeon and you are luckier on the second time! I think part of the reason I'm going in another time is that no one expected my cancer to be so invasive.  But I'm good with all of it.  I still have feeling in my breast (although my nipple drives me nuts sometimes with its temporary sensitivity to everything!).  I've had some setbacks, but that's part of it.  Doesn't make me happy, that's for sure.  I know I'm going to have radiation as I chose the lumpectomy, but now we're trying to figure out if I need chemo, too, since my cancer was more than anyone originally thought. Would I do it differently, knowing what I do now?  NO.  I'm totally at ease with my decisions (everyone has to make personal decisions for herself), even though by not choosing a mastectomy with my second surgery I now face a third lumpectomy.  But a mastectomy came with additional surgeries for sure, which I didn't want to have.  What comes after my next surgery (tentatively scheduled for Monday)?  Dunno.  I'm still waiting to hear about the results of my Oncotype DX test (which will be an indicator of the usefulness of chemo for me).  If it says yes to chemo, then I'll get a port inserted with my next surgery.  If it says no to chemo, I'll have some champagne and just another lumpectomy and some lymph nodes pulled.  (BTW, the lymph node recovery is a pain.) One thing I have learned about all of this is that nothing is for sure until it has happened. I wish you clean margins after your second.  If they don't go after your lymph nodes, I would venture a guess that your recovery will be much like your first time. So, do you have a choice:  another lump vs. mast.?  If so, you should hear from others who have made a different decision from mine, just so you can weigh the options.  Also, I'd recommend that you meet with a plastic surgeon to talk about reconstruction, and a radiology oncologist to talk about radiation, and an oncologist to talk about chemo, if any of those things are on the table for you.  You can always recover from surgery, you just want to choose the right one for you. Find out everything you can and make your best decision and don't second guess it.  You will do the right thing. Hmm.  I'm rambling.  You'll find I tend to do that.  Hope it helps a little... D1",

With my second lumpectomy, they also did a SNB--which is a separate scar under my arm.  When one of my sentinel nodes came back with micromets, they decided to do an anxially node excision at the same time as my 3rd lumpectomy (which was for clean margins).  They used the same scar (but made it MUCH longer) for the nodes, too.  I've actually had more trouble recovering from the node surgeries than the lumpectomies. So, for 3 lumpectomies and 2 node surgeries, I have only 2 scars!  Not bad, considering... Rebounding from surgery has gotten more challenging each time--I think my body is just getting tired of it.  I will say use ice--I swear by it. Now I'm waiting to hear about chemo or no (I definitely get rads and hormone therapy).  It's always something! Good luck tomorrow. D1",

      "Content": "Apr 7, 2008 06:07PM Determined1 wrote: Take a couple of days off and whew!!!  Weekend was good.  Bil has been taken off the vent and is smiling and complaining (that's good).  My inlaws even returned home Sat. night.  Next up will be assessing damage (apparently, he's really having coordination issues now) and figuring out what kind of rehab he'll need.  The inlaws think he'll end up in some sort of facility for a while, but at least he's out of the woods.  Thanks for your prayers--I know they helped. Dd had a FABO weekend on the courts.  They played 3 games on Sat.  The first one was okay--she was waking up.  Second game she had 17 (take that, varsity coach!) points and was rebounding like a fiend.  She had 5 assists and was even diving for loose balls (her usual thinking is that there are 4 other girls on the court with me, let them dive for the balls, so it was surprising to see her going for them).  It was a very fast-paced game and it was great to see her step it up.  Final game was against a team of girls headed to play college ball.  Dd's team is a mix of high school sophs and juniors, so there was certainly an experience disparity.  Well, dd stepped it up another notch.  She was jumping to block shots, out rebounding girls taller than she was, I mean, everything was looking like my girl was off to have another fab game.  Then the other team decided my dd needed to be double-teamed to contain her.  But not only did they double-team her, they also got very physical.  I was at the scorer's table, so I had a great vantage point and it was disturbing to see the fouls these girls were committing against my dd.  Unfortunately, we only had one ref (there were ref issues all weekend long), and he wasn't able to keep up with the pace of the game, so this other team was having a field day just hacking the sh*t outta our girls.  Finally, our girls had enough and started retaliating.  Well, you know how that works.  It's always the retaliator that gets caught.  So my baby, (who isn't a fouler by nature, and in all the year-round bball she plays, hasn't ever fouled out), got three calls in as many minutes.  The ref came over to the table at one point and I told him he needed to keep an eye on #25 on the blue team (we were white), he said, \"25!  I can't keep up with 44 (that was my kid, so I slunk down in my chair and shut up)!\"  Well, dd fouled out.  After that, the other team double-teamed our 2nd best player.  In fact, #25 went out of bounds to track down the ball and ran back on the court and actually head butted one of our girls!  And the ref didn't do a thing till our girl turned around and gave #25 the 1-2 punch!  Then he went running calling a tech.  At that point, I stood up at the scorer's table and told the guy on the clock to turn it off--I was calling the game.  The ref looked up and I told him, game over because he couldn't keep the kids safe at that point.  Now I have to write a letter to the commissioner of the tournament and defend my decision to call the game when that's the ref's role.  Oh well.  What are they going to do?  Tell me I can't work the scorer's table again?  No loss there, I'm a volunteer!  Anyway, I was happy to see my kid play so well and am looking forward to her continuing her rehab into a confident player. So, onward. Therese--How exciting to walk in the Komen!  And to have your co-workers and their families there in your honor is a wonderful testimony to you. Paula--don't you love the quiet time with the dh?  We never know what to do with ourselves when we get it.  You're probably right on the x-rays.  I see babydoc tomorrow so I can confirm. Vettegal--So sorry about Vettesis.  Hopefully, they're catching it all early.  I hope she comes to the boards for support.  Hey, great news about your literary endeavor--I can't wait to read my copy!  Oh, and not to worry about rads--they're a breeze compared to chemo. Hey Peg!  Glad you're coming outta the fog.  I've got the 24-7 night sweats, too--very annoying. LWDana--Full plate for you, as always.  Hope you did well on the test today. Tinalee--you motorcycle mama, you!!  Glad its finally \"springy\" enough for your bikes. Oh Jenn, so sorry about your fil.  I hope the added stress won't burden your dh to the point he feels the need to drown them.  But if you have an addictive personality, times like these can be very trying.  I hope he gets the support he needs right now, too.  (Don't we all need support in some form or other???)  My thoughts are with you. Carol--the quilt, and its story, is beautiful (as are you assuming the position in your recliner).  Sounds like you were party central this past weekend.  As SIS Kimberly would say, WOOHOO! Hey, congrats Joan!!!!!  FUBC!!! PALady--I have muscle aches, too!  As for other chemo se's, my fingertips, toe tips and tongue tip are still numb. My fingernails are like op art--every day they're different colors of yellow, red, purple, and black and it seems one bleeds out every other day.  My vision is still off and swelling in my ankles and face/eyes continues.  But I think everything else has subsided.  So, really, its not horrible, its just that I'm coming up on 6 weeks since my last tx and am wondering when it will all move on! I'm laughing at Paula, Jenn and KathyL about having periods at the same time as dd's.  When our second daughter was born the first thing dh said when the doc announced, \"Its a girl!\" was, \"Oh no, a WHOLE house full of PMS!!!\"  We still laugh over it as it HAS been trying at times! Wow, that was too long.  Sorry. Thoughts out to Carol, KathyL (first solo H--all the best), and Kris (last one!!!!!) for tomorrow.  FUBC! D1",

First of all, I forgot to mention to Sista2 that I didn't have problems with my hands/rings, but I had a situation with my left ear (left is bad boob side) where my earrings made my pierced hole ooze and flake.  I had to change to my real gold earrings and LWDana suggested I dip my posts in neosporin before inserting.  That did the trick and eventually the problem cleared.  I wonder if its the same kind of problem you're having with your rings?  (Although I wear an incredibly cheap ring on one of my toes 24-7 and that did not cause me any trouble at all.  Not sure what any of it means.) LWDana--Good to hear from you.  I'm sorry one of your classmates is being such a PITA.  Hope you can let it roll off your back and get about your business.  You have so much on your plate right now that I'm not sure I'd spend much energy on insensitive people.  Fingers are crossed that your scan goes well. Carol--Ugh.  The ice burn (sorry, my only experience is with a floor burn, so not sure what to call that) sounds awful.  I really dread those moments in the hotel room with my kid when things don't go well.  It really forces you to focus all your energy on being the good parent--not always easy.  (No, reword that as not EVER easy.)  I hope you'll be in bed early tonight and try to remember that tomorrow (even at 3 f-ing a.m.) is another day.  I hope ds is able to have some success tomorrow (even if that means not wiping out and aggravating his ice burn), so he can head home with a positive thought.  I'll cheer for him (only because with the time difference, I'll be up anyway!). Off to bed now. D1",

Dh and college girl are on their way back to Carlisle, so I have a couple of hours to kill (not sure where dd went--I think she toddled off to meet some friends for a little while, since there's no school tomorrow for teacher's work day).  Tomorrow dd is tagging along to my rads appointment (hope there isn't a backup tomorrow, not sure about her patience level at the doc's office), then we're going to eat lunch on the Georgetown University campus (remember, I've switched to Georgetown University Hospital for chemo and rads), then we're going to take the campus tour.  Dd is thinking about G'town as an option, so we thought we'd take advantage of the day off from school to visit. So, SIS Kimberly, things must be better if you're back on laundry duty.  Just take it easy.  We want those temps to GO AWAY! Carol--Hooray on surviving the last day of skating w/o any skin donations.  (Rollerblades--now that's totally cool!!) Paula, I'm so impressed that you worked concessions after your nasty-lasta shot.  It must be a sign that you're feeling okay right now.  Here's hoping the se's take it easy on you this time. Vettegal--Your upbeat vibe is so infectious!!!  Thanks.  My hair is coming in colorless (someone described it as Arctic White) and textureless (sticks straight out of my head and you can't even feel it when you pinch a piece of it--EXTREMELY fine).  There are some over an inch long, but they're sparse.  The majority is about 1/4 inch.  You still really just see a bald, shiny scalp when you look at me. Tinalee--Glad to hear the worst of the weather skipped you.  I was SO thinking about you as I heard the forecasts for this weekend.  I'll see if I can get the recipe on here--they're not health food, but yum city!!! Oh, PB (pink/poor boob) is still pink today.  I'm bummed about that as it doesn't bode well for its future.  It does not hurt, however.  The only thing that's bugging me are my bits of scar tissue.  They have an angry feel to them, if that makes sense.  I see babydoc again on Tuesday and I'm going to find out what's the deal on the scar tissue pain. Hey, college girl brought me home a bottle of the Dove sunless tanner lotion after a Target run (with my debit card, of course).  She was tired of hearing me whine about my pasty pallor.  I used it yesterday and today, but don't really notice anything.  Has anyone here ever used it?  Will I be orange or streaky?  Just wondering. Hmmm.  Well, I'm going to see what other trouble I can get myself in to before people come home. D1",

Wednesday is my day off from the gym, so I have time to chill before my appointment in the tanning bed (my rashy area itches like a bitch!  I'm trying really hard to keep my hands off.)  I should be watching the tivo'd DWTS results show (can't watch those reality shows in real time-too many commercial breaks), because I want to make sure I'll live to see Jason shake that booty another week, but here I am, instead... Therese-the dh and I are watching John Adams, but we've tivo'd it (where would I be without tivo??), so we've only seen 3-4 episodes.  We're really enjoying it.  Although I don't think the guy from \"Sideways\" (Giamatti?) makes a good John Adams.  Laura Linney is awesome, though.  I didn't know daughter Adams had bc.  I guess I'll have to have tissues nearby when we get to that episode. How are the eyebrows?  Mine are dropping like leaves in the fall.  You can see new ones are starting to grow in when you look in a magnifier mirror, but right now I have some serious blank patches.  I haven't tried to draw new ones in because I pretty much suck at that.  I'm also still experiencing a good deal of pain in several of my joints/muscles.  The worst is my left achilles' tendon-I can barely negotiate stairs.  At least the right one has gotten better in the last couple of days, so I'm hopeful.  I also have pain along that big muscle on the tops of your thighs.  That Taxotere really hangs on, doesn't it? Oh man, Sheshe, what a crappy time to have allergy issues.  Unfortunately, now that it's Spring, you won't get much relief from that for a while.  I hope you have some OTC meds that can help.  Rads aren't that bad.  I think the trick is to get some exercise to help with the low energy.  I managed to stay energized through the first 3 weeks and now notice that I flag sometime mid-afternoon, but I'm learning to save \"sit-down\" work for that time.  It goes by much faster than chemo did. Kris-Congrats on surviving your first Taxol.  I hope you tolerate it as well as LJ13 seems to be.  Let us know how you're doing. Good news on the nose, Carol!  Funny that you'd mention surgery for your \"freckle.\"  My dh is having 4 \"freckles\" burned off today (he had just one done a couple of months ago and tolerated it well enough to just get the rest done at once).  I think his dermie used a similar terminology when describing his, but his are quite big (well, he's a big guy-6'5\"!).  You're smart to have it removed, although it sucks that you have to have it done surgically-I think all of us here are a little tired of surgery... I'm anxious to hear how the LAST ONE went for SIS Kimberly yesterday.  And all the best to Wendy and Sheebas who are bellying up today.  FUBC!!! D1",

Okay, I'm loving the SP thing.  It made me feel SOOO good to send something, and then I got something from my SP and I'm just a smilin' fool!  Thanks SIS Kimberly/Carol for hatching the idea and setting it up.  (I'm going to continue to believe I have no clue as to the identity of my SP, because it's so much fun!) Dinner was delish.  I stayed the course and ordered a petite filet, Caesar salad and spinach.  Yummy in my tummy.  Dd was in a foul mood, but we didn't let her spoil anything.  She'd taken an AP test in the morning and then worked all afternoon where a customer asked if she'd get someone who knows how to wrap a present after dd had just wrapped the gift (she works in a toy store that offers wrapping services).  Crushed dd's confidence for the afternoon. Her head was still in a bad place for her first bball game this morning.  Coach even had to call her over to the side to explain to her that 5 turnovers in 10 minutes was not acceptable.  She didn't get the message, so he benched her for a good part of the game.  I think that was a good move on his part because by the time we got to the second game, she was on fire!  14 points (6 of them 3s) and some good passing and rebounding.  They at least won the second game.  If they win tomorrow, then they qualify for Division II Nationals.  We're not sure we want them to qualify as this particular daughter has played in AAU Division I nationals 3 times already (for a different team) and they finished in the top 10 in the Nation every time.  This current team just isn't as deep, so we'd probably be wasting a lot of time and money to go.  We'll just have to wait and see how they do tomorrow before we get our bowels in an uproar (sorry, Carol). Therese-you sound like you're recovering really well from your surgery.  It sounds like your body is reminding you to take it a little easier.  I'm glad to hear that you seem to be listening.  So the new girls look good, eh?  How exciting for you!  Do you have to get the nipples and stuff like KathyL?  (Don't mean to be such a dimwit about new boobs-it's not part of my deal, so I've never bothered to learn what it entails.) Shoot, SIS Kimberly, you should've gotten an airline ticket to attend that Spring Sing, sounds right up your alley!  Hope your tootsies are holding out on the walk. Tinalee-Happy Birthday!!!!  How fun to get that \"double whammy\" every once in a while.  I hope the sun shines all day long for you.  Oh, and when you get to it, plant a tomato plant for me.  I used to have several varieties, but the squirrels have gotten so bad here that I've finally given up.  Plus, my neighbors' trees are creating too much shade for a sunny garden.  Poopy-doo.  I've taken to planting some bleeding hearts and other shade-loving flowers to enjoy and have a couple of pots on the other side of the house with my herbs in them and leave it at that.  (Oh, I do plant a few jalapeno plants at my in-laws so I can pickle them come fall.) Paula-Yeah, the switch to rads is an adjustment, isn't it?  I think it was on my third tanning session that I had this feeling that I wasn't going to make it to the end (I only did 30 zaps total).  It just seems like so much and you have to go in every day.  Try to keep hydrated and lotion up your field.  And EXERCISE!  I really, really believe it helped keep my energy up (and believe me, it is much lower than it was when I started, even with the exercise).  Oh, and totally weird to have your boob out there with your arm restrained over your head while people admire your contours (they kept telling me mine were great-dh has yet to acknowledge their wisdom).  I'm not sure I got used to it-I think it was more I resigned myself to it. Maz-Yep, I had awful problems with neuropathy.  The arms/hands were better after about a month, but my fingertips (and toetips and tip of my tongue) are still numb.  I'm almost used to it-almost.  I hope the tingling doesn't mean you're going to have the nail problems I've experienced, but your description sounds familiar.  I've been keeping my nails short and try not to submerge them in water for too long to try to keep them from falling out.  So far, so good.  Let me know if your nails start to blacken or bleed out-I had that. I'm sorry this last tx is hitting you so hard.  I was really impatient with se's and found it tiring to try to get back to \"normal\" (whatever that is).  It sounds like you're in a similar head.  Try to relax and let the poison out of your system.  It takes a lot more time than it should, IMO.  You'll bounce back. Glad you got to your destination safely, Carol.  I'm with you-let the ds head off at 4:30a on his own!  Thanks for the report from your doc visit.  Boy, I sure know how you feel about having folks rub your numb boobala area.  I get it every time I go in for my le massage.  Fun.  (Not.) Ohh.  Have to stop.  Dh has dinner ready.  Gotta love that. If I don't get a chance to stop in tomorrow, Have a Happy Mother's Day, everyone!!! D1",

Dd's bball team qualified for Nationals.  We're not sure what to do about that as in our house we all know her team won't even make it out of pool play at Nationals (they really aren't that good), so we have to decide if it will be worth the money to get to Disney World in Orlando (where Nationals for her age group will be held).  I think a team meeting is in order... Ooofdah,Carol!  Sounds like ds's first night was a long one!  I should read on, maybe you've given some details of his first day... Paula-I like your comments to Carol.  You're right on. Thanks for keeping my grammar in order, SIS Kimberly!  Hope your temps give some relief-you guys really don't need to extend your fire season any longer. Maz-Sounds like the SP delivered at exactly the right time for you!  (Again, SIS Kimberly/Carol, you two are studly for putting this together for us.)  I see my onc on Weds. to figure out what's next for me.  Before I started chemo, he was recommending either Tamoxifen or Arimidex for 5-10 years, but he was going to start after rads-not simultaneously.  It's probably just another protocol, but make sure your rad onc knows that your onc is putting you on some drugs during rads.  My rad onc didn't even want me to take a multi-vitamin! Good to hear from you, Patty.  I'm sorry Denise is feeling like the Cancer Gods are not on her side.  We all have a different journey on this road, and Denise has hers.  I bet she'll get breaks where she doesn't even realize it.  I hope her AND doesn't show any more node action.  Be sure you let us know.  Meanwhile, I'll send her my very best thoughts. You're right about the caregivers needing support, too.  The dh and I had lunch together a couple of weeks ago and I acknowledged to him how difficult it must've been for him.  I couldn't believe the rush of emotion he had when I said the words out loud.  He said he felt like he was all alone thinking how hard it was on him.  We all need to remember to thank our caregivers more often-this is tough for them, too. I'll root for the Penguins for ya-I'm not really in to hockey, so I don't have a team affiliation... Well, I should wrap this up.  I'm typing it on my new computer and I still have some work to do to make things work around here (for one thing, I have to figure out the wireless router so college girl can use her computer and stops using everyone else's!)

I shot out of the blocks this morning and I'm so tired now I could cry.  I cleaned my stove (yeah, I'm weird, I do it at least once a week because it's on an island in my kitchen and I feel that anything in the middle of the room should represent well), cleaned out the cabinet under the kitchen sink (gross!) and scoured the sink.  Then I trimmed and grilled chicken to use for enchiladas for dinner.  Finally, college girl got her sorry ass outta bed and we went to the gym together.  Barely made it home in time for a shower and then off to see my legu.  Since then, I've vacuumed my main level and figured out one more thing on my new computer.  Now I'm here, seeing what's up with my sisters. You're right, WVgirl, it's the insurance that sucks!  Hopefully we'll both figure out our car issues soon!  Unfortunately, college girl just found out that the retail job for which she applied fell through.  She's up showering now and I'm supposed to have some good ideas for her when she comes back downstairs.  She has a paid internship set up for the end of June, but she's got to be earning some money now, too. SIS Kimberly-to continue the car discussion...I think we'll get something used for the girls to use.  We hadn't really budgeted for a car right now and can't really afford a new one (getting to be cation time in my house and we totally blow our wad on our trips).  The car thing is really a PITA because we only need it for one year because the following year, my dd will be off for her freshman year in college (that year you can't have a car) and college girl will be on her study abroad program that year, too, so all the girls' cars will just sit.  (Wonder if you can just park a car for a year and cancel the insurance on it?????)  Anyway, it'll be our family issue for this summer. I started to lol over the Three Foobies and was rushing off to note that you would actually be the Six Foobies, but then I read that you caught it, too.  Oh, and melon sweating=detoxing?  You're in rare form today! So, how'd the workout go???? Guess that's enough resting.  Should go put those enchiladas together... D1",

Yesterday was such lousy weather.  I was glad to be in a gym.  Dd did well in her games, yesty.  Dh and I are working on reminding her to adjust some little things.  I'm hoping she's more receptive to our suggestions than she's been in years past-it's so hard to be a teenager!  Another game today, but it'll take a little over an hour to drive each way, so it's a 4-5 hour commitment again.  Glad this is our last season of AAU...  (Although the dh and I were expressing how thankful we've been the last two seasons that we only have one kid playing-the weekends when we had 8 games every weekend between two kids were really hard.) Tinalee-I'm getting the same input on the ooph/tamox deal.  I can't seem to get out of having to take it.  I'm going to try to get a full exam with my gyn in the next couple of weeks so we can establish a baseline for my body, just in case there are some se's that aren't noticeable to me, but lurking in my body.  It's funny, I'm actually more afraid of tamox than I was chemo.  When was your last period?  Mine was Jan. 1 (that's an easy one to remember!).  My onc says that if I still have no period after 8 months, they'll consider me post-menopausal (of course, I'm participating in a study to try to determine actual menopause status, so who knows?).  I don't think they'll give me an AI right away as those leech your bone density and the tamox is supposed to enhance it.  Plus the tamox has been successfully used in post menopausal women as well.  My team keeps referring to a study that shows tamox for a few years followed by 5 years of AI is best.  They say I'll be taking drugs for 5-10 years.  Oh boy. Oh, and I'm impressed that you're withholding judgment on your girls, I get freaked out by the looks of the stitches and forget that it all takes time.  Speaking of time, I'm noticing that when I touch an area on Frankenboob, I get an electrical jolting sensation on my shoulder blade.  Maybe my nerves ARE regenerating!!!! Sounds like the dh is going to come home rejuvenated, KathyL!  That's a good thing.  You sound like you're shouldering the single parent stuff okay, which must be a great realization for you.  I miss/don't miss the days of taking my kids to lessons and practices.  You get such a great talk time during those jaunts.  Now I have to extract teeth to get info outta my girls!  I don't miss having to work my own schedule around being an available chauffeur, tho! So you get your nipple tattoo on Tuesday, eh?  Will they do the whole job in one sitting?  The whole recon thing seems so foreign to me-it's nice having so many of you here willing to share your experience. Dh and I watched \"Recount\" last night.  We were in Nashville on election night 2000, waiting for results.  That was such an emotionally confusing night.  It's funny, it wasn't confusing for me, personally, but I really felt it for our country.  Anyway, dh knows many of the Gore people and we were hoo-haaing over the actors chosen to portray them.  Kinda fun.  (Oh, and if you ever see Gore's \"An Inconvenient Truth,\" you can see my dh's acting debut.  When they get to the part where Gore is talking about his son's accident and then they cut to Gore at a hearing with a staffer whispering in his ear-the staffer is my dh!  He's on-screen for a full 3 seconds!  Dark hair and all!  We always freeze frame that part!) I think I need some more caffeine, so I'll check in tomorrow.  Busy afternoon today, we have to clear out our kitchen/breakfast nook/family room (kinda one big area) as the painters arrive on Tuesday for three days of turmoil.  Dh leaves town again Monday morning (I accused him of leaving to avoid the painting mess), so we have to clear the rooms while we have his brawn (such as it is) to do the heavy lifting.  The fun continues. Gettin' those counts up, Carol?????? D1",

I'm not sure if I've complained about my newest ache, yet, but my shoulder has been hurting a lot lately.  I really noticed it in Austin when I would take off my garment at night and put on a bra instead (at home I just put on my pj's and don't even bother with the bra).  After returning to our room after clubbin' it (not really, but it sounds good), I found unhooking my bra in the back to be very painful for my left shoulder.  Well, turns out that the rads position must've compromised the muscles in my shoulder as I apparently have a mess going (they were using a lot of words to describe it--one being atrophy, which made me wince, since I spend so much time working out).  There were 3 therapists crowded around me today all speaking in \"tongues,\" (medical stuff about muscles), trying to figure out how best to fix me.  They decided on this hard rubbing that hurt so much I was in a full body sweat within seconds.  The good news is that they think they can help me, so I'll put up with the pain if I can get my motion back.  It's funny, I've discovered that I can no longer lift dishes above my head to put them away, so I've been leaving them on the counter.  It didn't dawn on me till I couldn't get my bra off that I might have a problem.  Wonder what else I'm ignoring??? LJ-sounds like you're really doing well after your surgery.  That's great.  Don't rush the drain removal, they really do perform an important service. Unfortunately, I guess I've become kinda vain in my advancing years and can't wait to color my hair.  When I was younger, I swore I'd never do it, but once I started, I liked not having the gray and would race to my hairdresser just as soon as the \"skunk\" line of gray appeared at my part on the top of my head.  What a girl I turned out to be! SIS Kimberly-All I can say is \"WOW!\"  Your cation sounds like it was perfect for your mind, body and soul.  I'm so happy that you had such a good experience.  That part of the world is so unbelievably beautiful, isn't it?  Thank you so much for the vivid descriptions of what you saw and how it made you feel.  It's almost like being there myself (I said almost).  And now it sounds as though you're doing some serious nesting in preparation for your exchange surgery on Friday.  (Or getting a lady to come in and help you with the nesting!)  Glad you're back, as we missed you, but I'll bet you're looking forward to the next cation, aren't you? Oh, I've agreed to participate in a second study at Georgetown.  This one is to follow patients with a family history of cancer and see if genetic counseling can/should play a greater role in determining a person's cancer risk.  Since there are 4 girls in my original immediate family (mom, me, twin sisters) and 3 of us have had different forms of cancer, we've caught the eye of the study director (course, the fact that my sisters are twins and one has had cancer and the other hasn't was a big selling point to include us).  So I'm doing my best to give back.  It makes me feel good about myself. Okay, I'm going to do a sweep through the rooms to be painted and make sure we're ready for the painters tomorrow.   I'll be happy to have it all done and the furniture back.  Particularly since college girl told me this morning that a couple of friends from college are visiting us this Friday night!

I'm hot and tired.  I just got back from my Race for the Cure.  It's now 105 degrees outside, according to the weather minder on my computer.  I drank tons of water and my dh tossed a cup over my head (we all laughed how it wouldn't mess up my hair!).  There were approximately 50,000 people at the walk and WAY too many pink shirts.  I only saw one woman with shorter hair than mine, most of the survivors (weird word) were clearly a few years out from their tx.  I wore my pink tshirt and my boobies cap (complete with assorted bc pins on it).  My friend showed up bearing gifts-she gave me a dog tag with my name on one side and \"FUBC\" and the words \"You are an inspiration\" printed on the other.  I almost cried.  I think it will become a wardrobe staple for me. We walked the 5K in 1 hour 20 minutes, which was amazing, considering how packed the streets were with people.  You could barely move!  We saw groups of folks walking with photos pinned to their shirts and we were all thankful that I was wearing a pink shirt and they weren't wearing my photo.  It's funny, I get into my own little world and forget that people are still dying from bc-I feel so alive!  Guess I should take time to remember how lucky I am. Anyway, I recommend the walk to all of you.  Affirmation of survival is a wonderful attitude adjuster.  I'm going to try to be a better person-for a few days, at least. WVgirl-I don't know why, but I thought you were done with your tx.  Well, a big ole sloppy WOOO HOOO to you!!!  Hope your relay went well. You're so funny, SIS Kimberly, not enough nesting at home for you before surgery, oh no!  You had to go in to school to get your itch scratched!!!  No making fun of me cleaning with Q-tips.  I hope the surgery went well.  I'm anxious to read on and see if you have a report posted. Oh, and you remind me-I spotted Helen Reddy right away, too!  My sisters and I made up alternative words to that one that are not fit to print here.  ;) Alright, Carol, the pooper's back in biz!!!  Oh, and I see YOU'RE the one giving me grief about the Q-tips... Glad I'm not the only one confused about WVgirl's tx status.  Sorry, Carla, we're still with ya all the way. Isn't graduation wonderful, Tinalee?  I've got one left next June.  They take our senior class and put them on a boat on the Potomac for the night-same idea as locking them in the school.  The kids around here speak disparagingly of the Boat Trip, but they all go!  Your kid is a real cutie, too, love the dimples!  You guys should be proud of him.  Your older son's trip sounds amazing, although you wouldn't catch me dead on that trip (I think I've already shared that I survived a week in the Boundary Waters Canoe area when dh and I were first dating and I had to prove my manhood-no more of that for me).  I don't see how he could miss learning a little about himself on a trip like that. Okay, shit from Julie, too???  I think you guys are just jealous that I'm so compulsive (although you wouldn't know it from seeing my house!).  Hope the fill is tolerable this time around.  Doubling up sounds like hurty time to me, so my hat is off to you for having the courage to try it. Got to your second pic, Tina.  That's got to be your wig and I'm the one who's jealous now!  If I didn't know it, I would never guess that's a wig.  I NEVER looked that good in mine (guess that's why it's already in the back of my closet). Carol, hats off to you if you can manage a 10 or 12 miler.  My hips are killing me after just 3 miles!  And my big toenails (the ones threatening to fall off) are achey from hitting the tops of my shoes.  Perhaps the workout on the elliptical doesn't simulate a good old fashioned walk very well... Goodness, Carol, are you talking to yourself again????  I've looked back over our posts a couple of times myself, but it's been a while now.  They always make me feel closer to everyone, because you're right, the more we know of one another and our journeys, the more those early comments fit together.  I agree, we've all been so lucky to meet. Thinking of SIS Kimberly. Man, I'm hungry.  I think I'll try to motivate people here and see about some food. D1",

Paula, like you don't have enough on your plate right now.  I hope the new trial works for you guys.  The universe works in strange ways, so keep the faith. I use the Q-tips to dust crevices on my knick-knacks.  I don't have a lot of that stuff (remember, the dh is a Scandi), but I've picked up a few things that are treasures to me on cations over the years.  Crevices only get dusted a few times in life, so I'm celebrating the fact that they are clean for now! Boy, I hope you guys get a cation soon.  They're good for the soul.  The US has so much to offer, so a road trip is always good.  I'm trying to \"collect\" all 50 states and I only have Vermont, North Dakota and Mississippi left.  Don't think I'll be hitting all of those in one trip!  I'm doing okay on continents-North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa so far.  I've always wanted to visit Australia, but I'm not sure I'll ever get to Antartica...(or if I really want to).  I live for my travels and we're really getting psyched for our next trip.  Dh was just calling Croatia this a.m. and was so relieved to find someone to speak English.  (I must say, I'm always so impressed at how much English the world speaks.  It makes me a little embarrassed that we don't learn more languages in the US.  I did my study abroad in Germany when I was in college, so I used to be pretty good at German and I've had 3 years of Spanish and 1 year of French.  Not sure if the 3 courses of Mandarin counts for much as you learn that language VERY slowly.  I can really only say \"hey, how are ya\" and \"thanks.\"  I can also ask if someone is tall or not as that was the sentence we learned to demonstrate the \"tones\" in that language.  Kinda like the whole \"the pen is on the table\" thing you learn in French). It sounds like you're tolerating rads well.  I'm glad for you.  I may sound like a broken record, but keep that baby lubed up and hydration is good, too.  The boosts are even easier than the whole field rad, but the burn shows up a few days later and seems to last longer.  I'm 4 weeks out and even though my skin is recovered, I can still feel the heat from the boost zone. OMG, Jenn, the whole casino thing sounds so exciting!  Like you said, no harm, no foul, so you were all able to enjoy the camaraderie that comes with shared inconveniences.  Hope your weather gets better. Wow, Julie, I'm so impressed that you were out supervising when you're just off your double-fill.  What a trooper.  And, yeah, I'm totally sick about the cleaning.  This will pass! Carol, I'm grimacing at your tummy troubles.  I know what you mean about counting down the days.  I've done my share of that over the past 9 months.  Hang in there.  You're certainly active enough, so you can't say you're not doing what you can to help your body out.  Those darn poisons they give us, many, they do a number, don't they? Oh, KathyL, I'm just so moved reading about your Relay.  Dh even just stumbled in and I told him about your experience (he's not been \"into\" the whole Jewels thing-he always just says, \"oh, you're talking to your friends again\").  I'm amazed at all of the different ways you all were acknowledged and celebrated.  Wow. Oh, and my sister clean-a-holic!  Thanks for the affirmation. SIS Kimberly-You make me laugh.  Love your take on your foobies.  You make me wish I had some (almost).  You may have a gargantuan WOOOOOOOHOOOOOOO from me!!!! Okay, I lol at the comment that you get up at 1am to pee... Hmmm.  So I end my shouts on a comment about Kimberly's urinary habits.  Oh well.  It is what it is. Tomorrow I see babydoc for my rad followup and then I go to have my blood drawn for the menopause study (I must really want to pay it forward if I'm agreeing to a blood draw).  I hope I have a chance to stop in.

Yesterday w/babydoc went well.  I don't see him again till November at which time he's going to order a new MRI for me (I didn't even have to remind him that I'm not very confident about mammos, he remembered).  He said I'm healing so well that he thinks if I keep my field out of direct sunlight this summer that will be enough (at first he said it would be a year, so I'm pleased).  Then I went upstairs to give my blood for the menopause study.  The gal running the study is really a sweetie.  She's going to be a fab onc one day.  I told her about my rotator cuff thing and she didn't need to hear more, she got out her script pad and wrote me one for a consultation.  So I'll take that with me today for my le massage and have my legu hook me up with the best rotator therapist they have.  I'm SO ready to have that under control.  Anyway, back to my blood draw.  While there, my assistant onc (the one running the test), told me to make an appointment to see my onc in 3 months.  So I don't have to go back to Georgetown for a doc appointment for 3 months!!!!  WoooHooo!!! So let's see what everyone is up to. Maz-You look fabo in that photo, dahling.  And you must be really proud of how your son is turning his life around.  Sounds like both of you are ready to get on with it. Julie-You're quite the supervisor!  Way to go on all the outdoor stuff you're getting done.  It always makes me feel so good when I look out of my windows and see a good looking yard.  I sure hope you guys are able to get started on the US tour.  I've been SO amazed at all the wonderful and beautiful things in our country. OMG SISKimberly!  I would LOVE to see Sheryl Crow!!!  I keep meaning to get out and buy her new CD.  I want to get the CD so I can download to my iTunes, but then have it for my car.  Oh, almost forgot to mention how much I enjoyed the new pic (I was all in to the Sheryl Crow news). Everything is moved back in, but the painter is going to come back to touch up a few things we've noticed since he left.  I've got to figure out when I'm going to be able to work that in... KathyL-I don't think our travels hold a candle to what CathyCA has done, but we really like to try new places and things.  My dh gets restless on vaca, so many of them are harder work than being at home, but we do get to see some amazing things.  I think learning about different cultures helps us to be more tolerant of differences, so I'm always encouraging us to try things that will broaden everyone's horizons.  And as long as we can avoid the cations that include camping, I'm happy! I hope the gymnastics finale is wonderful tonight.  My girls were such klutzes at gymnastics.  I always wished they'd done better at gymnastics and dance stuff, but it was not to be.  Good thing we were able to find basketball! Paula, I sure hope you're able to get Ed in to that trial.  I know it will be a lot of commuting for you guys, but it sounds like they know how to help him. Good Gawd, Carol, the weepies (not the group, as you duly noted) are a-okay.  I'm jealous that you're able to let all that emotion out.  Going for that last chemo tx IS a big day, and everyone here can totally empathize.  Give yourself the space to have your feelings, please.   And then get your butt in there today and totally fuck cancer over, but good!!! CathyCA-sounds like you're keeping yourself lubed.  When I saw babydoc yesty he attributed my speedy recovery to generous use of lubricants and exercise.  Sounds like you've got both of those nailed, yourself.  I hope you continue to breeze thru.  (By week 4 my nipple was a blistered mess, so it sounds like you're doing even better-you go girl!) Okay, speaking of fucking cancer over.  I have to start my Tamoxifen today and it's already 11:30 and I can't seem to make myself open the pill bottle and just do it.  I guess I'll get my strength from you guys.  I'll go get the damn pill.  I'm back.  When I went out to get my pill, college girl was parked in front of the tv (watching Jon and Kate plus 8-her new obsession).  She wondered what I was cussing about.  I told her I was getting my damn pill.  She made an excellent observation.  She said, \"Mom, you've had such a good attitude about everything else you're done.  You've just got to keep that attitude about your pill.\"  She's right.  Sigh.  Here goes. FUCK YOU BREAST CANCER!!!!!! D1",

On a happy front, I got my hair done yesty.  Color (the washout kind again, just because we don't want to stain the scalp and make me look stupid (stupider)) and a cut!  She even needed a broom to clean up afterwards!  It's super short on the back and sides again, but she left the top longer.  She's trying to give it some shape as it grows in.  The family doesn't think there's enough color in it-they want it darker, but I'm hesitant to go too dark as I don't want the shoe polish on the head effect.  Maybe more color next time (at the end of July). The dog's grooming appointment was a great success.  She's ready for summer! Wow, Kris, the countdown is on!  Don't make that trunk so big that you can't lift it... Oh yeah, KathyL, now THAT'S a rant!  You go girl!  Get that negativity off your chest!  (I loved the way you were still able to find the silver lining in the whole freezer fiasco-I'm anxious to read on and see how everything resolved.) Bummer, Carol, on the watersports ban.  I didn't even think of that.  Sounds like an excuse to sip on a margarita or something when you're parked on the poolside.  ;)  The sonogram will scan for any changes on the inside.  Call me paranoid, but I'm not taking any chances.  I asked him about the estrogens in soy, too.  He said it's photo-estrogen, meaning derived from plants.  He said it would be okay.  I'm doing some research on all the ingredients and I'm not really sure on all of them.  I'm hoping SIS Kimberly or LJ will know something-they both seem to be up on this sort of thing. Carla, I'm so sorry that there are so many bumps in your road.  I did see a positive in the fact that the DH (I noted you're using uppercase) showed up for a lap at your relay event.  And I loved the butterfly idea.  I'm sure it was very moving.  Get the MUGA on Fri and then get those nimrods in scheduling to get you on the MRI calendar.  Like you, I become quite frustrated with people who don't seem to be able to do their jobs.  Keep a calm head and try to treat them nicely, but firmly.  You don't want to piss them off and make them any less helpful (as if), but you do want to get your scans done ASAP.  Can your doc help with the scheduling snafu???  (Oh, and scream if you need to, we'll be listening.) A leak in the pool, Julie?  Not good timing for that.  I hope repairs don't set you back too much.  I loved your pics from your Race.  You look amazing.  And everyone around you is so happy.  Good for you. Back to the supplements for me, (you reminded me Tina), I'm going to run them by my onc before I start to take them.  I want to be sure everyone is on the same page.  God forbid I screw something up now-after all of this! Oh, and yeah, the hot flash thing is the most prevalent se I'm having too, Tina.  I wish mine were just at night.  The tamox seems to make them MUCH worse during the day and only worse at night (they were already bad at night, so they couldn't get much worse). Good to hear things settled a bit for you, KathyL.  Hey, you worked the cancer card on the fridge front-be pleased with your result.  By Friday you'll have everything straightened out.  It's all for the best.  You'll have to let us know what your scan results are.  Glad you survived the blown vein okay-I know we're the two biggest needle weenies on our thread!  Carol, I've kicked my dog out of the bed, much to her dismay.  I couldn't deal with her body heat and my body heat in the same bed.  You're a nicer mommy than I am!  (And thing-a-ma-jigger?  Is that a technical term???) I should go read the paper with dh for a few before he heads off for work. Later. D1",

So I tried a machine to do my MLD today.  One of the long term hassles of le is that I'll need massages several times a week for the rest of my life (that sounds like such an ordeal!).  I just can't see myself being tethered to my legu, even though I really like her.  So she recommended this machine called Flexitouch.  I've checked it out over on the le thread and it seems to be well-liked.  The problem is I just can't see myself needing this.  It's so therapeutic looking!  Makes me feel old and infirm.  Anyway, you strap yourself into these Velcro-closing garments-one for the hips and left leg, one for the main body, and a third for the left arm.  These pieces are connected to 4 hoses that are about 1 inch around, which I have to connect to the machine.  Then I lay down for 1 hour (who has an hour to spare?!) and let the machine do the massage.  It does a pretty good job of simulating the massage I get from my legu, and I have to admit, it's relaxing.  Plus my insurance will cover the entire cost.  But it seems so, oh, I don't know.  I think the root of my problem is coping with the idea that I really do need this massage a few times a week for the rest of my life.  Once I realize that's the truth, then the idea of going to the rehab clinic for every massage will begin to look less attractive.  I know it represents some independence for me, but it sucks.  (I was lying when I said I'd take the le bullet for the thread, so if anyone else wants it, I'm tired of it.) I'll get there.  Sigh. At least my hair looks good.  (If you'd told me 6 months ago that I would find this haircut attractive, I'd tell you to jump in a lake.  Perspective is a strange thing, isn't it?)  I'll try to get someone to take a picture of me so I can post it. WTF's a bolus? WVGirl-great news on getting your scans scheduled!  He deserves DH for laughing, I agree. PALady, the bag came from Macy's.  I was able to use their 15% off coupon to buy it. Yeah, your storms keep passing through here at about this time each night.  I think one of them caused my internet problems... I'm totally done with headcovers.  I get a lot of looks and some old guy came up to me just today and said, \"wow, you really cut your hair short for summer, didn't you?\"  I just smiled and said, \"yep.\"  Like I said, I think my hair is luxurious. Do have your swelling checked out-it probably is just hormones, given what you said, but better to be sure. Paula!!!  Last rad tomorrow!!  Grab those sunglasses and go for the gusto, girl!  Congrats to you! LOL that you've dubbed KathyL our Rant Queen!  Oh, but could we all be THAT queen for a day! And thanks for the bolus insight.  Carol, sorry, but it sounds like you're screwed.  Damn.  Stay up on the hydration and buttering-throw it all at your bolus byproduct. Julie, Julie, Julie-what were you thinking, girl???  Two new puppies? (Adorable, but still puppies.)  The one good thing you have going for you is that it's summertime and it stays light later (better for those infernal trips outside while you potty-train). So Therese, did your SP send you porn????? Damn, damn, damn, KathyL, that is NOT the news we were expecting.  I'm sorry it's not better.  My mom had osteoporosis in an advanced state and did some kind of therapy that involved many injections of something.  It not only stopped her bone loss, but reversed it.  Now she's back on Fosomax (but she's 70, I expect we'll all be downing calcium supplements hardcore when we're 70, too).  You might know what I'm talking about, but if you don't, let me know and I'll ask her what those injections were.   More needles, but I'll cyber hand hold you through them. MUGA-that's the heart one, right?  What about hitting the tm for 20 minutes 4x a week?  You know, strengthen it. You're not a downer.  Never worry about that. Oh, just read CathyCA and see she's extolling the virtues of cardio, too.  Worth a try, Kathy. CathyCA, I was in pretty good shape ten days after my last boost.  My nipple peeled big time (but I had a lot of blistering there) and I peeled in my boost area, but it was a weird peel-the hair follicles burned off, so I peeled off these teeny circles all over.  It was not like a sunburn peel.  I'm still lubing my boost field-the skin feels a little different there and I want to keep it lubricated for a while longer.  I'm down to two slatherings a day, so it's not a big deal.  I still find the boost area pinkens when I take a shower on the warm side, so I suspect things cook in there for a long time.  I finished rads 7 weeks ago. PATTY!!!!!  OMG.  So, so good to hear from you!!!  You brought tears to my eyes when you described dh and your last rads.  He really is our Vetteguy, isn't he?  An angry Denise?  Sounds normal to me.  Sometimes it takes some of us longer than others to travel through the 12 steps of acceptance.  She'll get there.  And the BEST news on the genetic testing-how wonderful to know you're not a mutant!  We missed you. Carol-you make me want to go out and buy up all of those cards here-but you'll have already sent them out (this from the gal having a hot flash as she types...)  You crack me up.  Thanks. No wi-fi in the Windy City, SIS Kimberly?  It appears you had to settle for snail mail!  Thanks for thinking of us. (I don't know what I've done in my life that I deserve to have such wonderful women in it, but I'm so grateful.) Okay, I need to find me a fan on a string-later! D1",

Got the dh off to San Bernadino for his business trip, but he was sweet enough to download a picture of me sporting my new \u2018do before he left.  Now I'm sitting here trying to figure out how on Earth to post it.  Let's see if I can remember...  Got it!  Hmm, hair looks pretty gray in this picture, but really, it's brown/blonde.  It will wash out and be all gray again, but till then I will enjoy it. Thanks for the input on Vassar, Joan.  I liked all of it except \"expensive!\"  Hopefully dd will get some money for her grades-they're pretty good.  But, alas, she has to get in, first... When I come up to see the campus, you'd better believe I'll be letting you know! No a/c, Carol?  We couldn't survive here without it.  Hope you were able to get comfortable last night.  The calf cramp sounds hurty to me.  I hope you stretched well this morning before you set off on your walk.  Sounds like the toe could be neuropathy-your description is all too familiar.  I suspect the cumulative effect of your chemo is catching up to you.  Thank goodness you won't be dumping any more of that shit into your bod! Oh, and you really hit the nail on the head re: the sympathy train.  Even dh said it's hard to feel sorry for me when I'm not sick anymore.  I guess I'll take that as a compliment. CathyCA-your story about the new car hits close to home here.  We have 3 cars and 4 drivers in our house and college girl wants to take the \"girls\" car back to school with her in the fall.  Dd and I say not so fast as we've gotten used to having the extra set of wheels around here.  So dd has been lobbying for a new car.  She keeps going to Craig's List to see what's available for $2000 or less.  They've all been pretty dumpy so far.  Or have a boatload of miles on them.  I think when we get back from vaca we'll have to get a little more serious, but no use in wasting a lot of brain cells on it now.  Good luck with your car shopping! Goodness, LJ, no need to apologize for a much needed vent.  I think by the time we get to rads we're so OVER the whole cancer patient scene that we're caught off guard by the reality that we are, indeed, still patients.  Be patient, my patient! And cool beans on the new DR set.  Perhaps your angel chorus will kick in once it's delivered and you're sharing your first meal.  (It seems to me that I've heard of Gardiners.)  And 51 is plenty old enough to manage a new DR set.  Enjoy! Okay, I'm going to see what mischief I can get myself in to while my dh is away! D1",

Then yesty, I sent my dh and daughters back home (dh had to catch a plane for a biz trip and daughters wanted to get home), and then my sisters, their families and I toured Monticello (Thomas Jefferson's estate) before returning to the DC area.  My NM sis left from southern Virginia today-they stayed in Charlottesville an extra night to look around. You know, it was really good. So what did you guys do for your weekend?  I'll go read up! Ah, Carol, I remember getting squeezed in so I didn't have to end rads on a Monday, myself.  There's something about that whole head game of adding the additional week.  So WoooHooo to you for making that work out for you!  (Hope the music was LOUD and made your heart swell with patriotism!) Man, SIS Kimberly, how do you keep up with yourself?  You make my head spin!  And another Jewel ending the drought!!!  You guys are going to start making me feel performance pressure! Great choice of words, Kris, you \"don't give a hoot\" who stares at you!  I lol at that one!  (Tomorrow's the last one!  Give cancer a big, final kick in the teeth for the Jewels, will ya?) SIS Kim-your pics are awesome!  It's been a while since I was in the Second City, so it's nice to reconnect.  Thanks for sharing them. Carol, your celebration sounds great!  I love how your community seems to get along well together.  Really brings home the notion of neighborhood, doesn't it? CathyCA-I can't believe you'll be waddling for long-you're WAY too active!  The fireworks sound great!  Catching a glimpse of several different shows would keep things moving, that's for sure. Smile to KathyL-My sister has been gone for about 2 hours and I've already washed her linens, put away the sleeping bags (well, I hung one up to air out, not sure if my nephew was showering well), and put my lower level furniture back where it belongs.  The cleaning people come on Wednesday, so I'm trying to restrain myself... SIS Kimberly-good words to Carol and Kent.  I COMPLETELY relate to how Carol feels-communication has always been a weakness in my marriage.  I think I need to listen in on your conversations with Carol and take some of it to heart.  Hey Tina-you HAVE to head this way!  So much to do and see (and I'm not even including a visit with me in that-there's a lot here!).  Do the scouts get up to DC when they're at the Jamboree?  Fort AP Hill can be quite a hike from the National Mall... I lol at the mention of Carol's Cream of Wheat diet!  You've come a long way, baby! You know, Carol, you remind me that I need to report on the Black Cohosh and my hot flashes.  I still have hot flashes, but (and maybe this is all my imagination) it doesn't seem like I have as many.  Maybe that stuff is helping! You can def see the similarities with your sis, Sherry.  Wow!  (Another Jewel seeing a sister for the 4th!) Great rant, CHJ!  You totally captured the whole rads thing.  Keep smiling and enjoying that new neighborhood.  Rads will be over soon. Good to hear Julie and the menagerie made it to Cheese Land! Welcome home, Paula.  Yeah, that laundry thing after a trip is quite the chore, isn't it?  Glad you and Ed had such a good time.  You both needed this break. Wow Deb!  You guys got a good sized fish!  Were you able to take it home?  It'd be so cool to have the fish cleaned and filleted (by someone else, of course) and then eat it.  Ummmmmm. I wasn't planning on the forum in Dallas.  It falls right when my role as Basketball Booster president hits full stride and my head fairly spins till the end of the season in February.  So I doubt it'll come up for me. Boy, Kimberly, you got your ROM back really quickly.  Your babydoc must be something!  I can't do any arm exercises, yet, either.  I have a couple of things I do with one of those elastic bands, but it's pretty wimpy stuff compared to my old routine.  I'll be happy to be past all of this. There's a lot of medical interactions in your post, Jenn.  So sorry about the grandson's arm-but you're right, it's unlikely it will be the last trip to the ER.  Great news about your friend's son.  I've been wondering how things were going for him.  I hope he continues to surprise his medical team.  As for you, please get those legs checked out.  That doesn't sound right to me... Oops.  My darling gals have returned from their outing to the gym and now want their dinner.  I'm off to respond to their every need! Tomorrow! D1",

He also asked about my sleeve and I told him, oh, yeah, he helped me qualify for a cancer parting gift-I have le!  He said, get this, \"you can't have le, I only took out half of your lymph nodes.\"  I held up my index finger and told him that it only takes one lymph node removed to put a patient at risk for le.  He started to object and I held up my finger again and told him firmly that it only takes one.  Dolt. (Yes, I think I'm the bitch from hell that will hound him for the next four years...) So, KathyL, thanks for the insight on the BRCA testing.  I'm still on the fence about it and need to talk it over with my dh (if I can ever get him to sit still for 5 minutes-he just left on another biz trip!).  I hear what you're saying about the ovarian cancer risk, Carol, cuz you're right, BRCA positive folks are at risk through the roof.  But my gyn is going to be watching me closely for uterine cancer (a Tamox se) and since the ovaries are nearby...  I'm really kinda wrapped about the insurance issue and then how this information will affect my girls if I'm positive.  Like KathyL said, my girls should get screening earlier, anyway, just cuz I've had bc.  Will the BRCA results change anything?  I don't think so.  (Is it better just to stick your head in the sand sometimes?????) CHJ, my red flags are my age (I was under 50 when I was dx'd), the fact that I'm of Jewish descent through my mother's side, and the fact that several people in my family have had various skin cancers.  The other items that she cited as flags are:  multiple bc or ovarian cancer in one family, multiple dx of cancer in one person, cancer running through maternal side (grandma, mother, daughter), or instances of male bc in your family.  With your history, I can see why they're talking to you about this.  I'll be curious to hear how you come to your decision on testing. Oh, and on the ovary removal question.  I actually asked my onc if he thought it would be a good idea for me since my cancer is er/pr+.  He said that removing the ovaries would stop hormone production for a while, but wouldn't end it permanently.  Apparently some of the fat stores in our body would begin to manufacture hormones.  Since I was suggesting the surgery to avoid taking Tamoxifen, it was clear to me that it would not get me out of it.  So I still have my ovaries.  (Although they're probably all shriveled up, but that's another story.) Hey Patty, good to hear from you.  Sorry they're going all Big Brother on you at work and you now have to sneak off to chat with us.  It's almost like having an affair, isn't it?  ;)  I suspect I would have the plumbing pulled if I were BRCA+, too.  Who knows, maybe the fact that I'm tired of surgery is part of the reason I'm not jumping on this.  Tamox hasn't made me dizzy.  I just have constant hot flashes (although I will say the black cohosh DOES seem to be helping.  They're not gone, but seem to be fewer.).  I also get leg cramps and want to cry all the damn time.  Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be causing me to gain weight, which is what happened to my neighbor.  That would put me over the top.  (I still have 2 lbs to lose from my dx weight and then I'm back to the old me.) I'm not sure, Kathy, that my bs detector is any better tuned-I've never had much patience for that.  I do find that I'm more sympathetic to other people with health issues.  I'm giving a little wider berth to them these days (allowing them to shuffle ahead of me instead of bulldozing right through them, for example).  It's funny, just this morning my dh was telling me that his boss' wife was just dx'd with bc.  Now you have to understand, this woman has never ever noticed me.  Whenever I speak to her, she looks past me and then will realize that I'm talking to her and gets the most impatient/annoyed look on her face.  Everyone at my dh's firm talks about how rude and cold she is.  So you can imagine my dh's surprise when I immediately said I'd call her and see how things are going.  He REALLY pressured me not to.  Eventually, he gave in and said if I want to, go ahead, but he didn't want to hear me complain about how needy she is down the road.  I know he's right-she's the kind of woman that will shine in the attention and not really need me for the sympathy at all.  I'll have to figure out what I want to do. Joan, that dog is too cute!  I'm with Carol, it would be hard to get mad at her for peeing on the rug. Glad everyone made it home okay, Julie.  Yuck on the Lyme Disease.  I've heard catching it early is key, so tell your dh not to delay getting in to the doc. Tinalee, you make me lol.  So you're a cycling junkie, huh?  Well its pig in shit time for you, then.  And two sons with a plan.  You must be happy to hear them looking ahead and figuring things out.  It sounds like it couldn't be better timing for you as you prepare for the next chapter in your life (I despise moving, too.).  And don't you worry, the right dog will come along. I think I'm going to go watch the last episode of Hell's Kitchen before my girls get off work today.  Maybe a quick trip to the liquor store, first, though, I'm out of gin and those G&Ts are hitting the spot these days (my sister drank almost the whole bottle of gin I bought 10 days ago!). Onward! D1",

So I got a package from my SP...a WAY cool gardening bag with some tools.  Oddly, I'm really excited about the cushion that came with it for my poor knees, as I had to throw mine out about 5 years ago and never replaced it.  Now I can't wait for September, when the bugs abate a bit and I can get out in my garden and play.  I'll be using all my toys to switch out my impatiens for pansies (yes, I can leave pansies out all winter here and they bloom again in the Spring-global warming).  Thanks ever so much, SP!!!!  Oh, and you should see the cute little crop of cilantro growing in the mug you sent me.  It really makes for a bright spot on the front porch and announces to the world what a gardening goddess I truly am (even if the yard doesn't always look it).  You're a great SP. SIS Kimberly-I read with a smile at how busy you are.  I am, however, REALLY worried about SIS Kathleen (and upset that I'll be on cation when she gets her results).  We'll all be pulling for her.  Oh, and yeah, the paranoia thing weighs heavy on my mind on the whole testing issue.  I'm hoping we can talk about our options around here real soon.  Try not to leave your heart in San Fran. You made me laugh, KathyL, with the comment about surgeons working with people who are asleep.  So true. Carol-just chillax and enjoy your nip, girl!  No need for knicker twisting these days.  It'll all work out (and you see, it did just that for you and your dins).  Take a deep breath. You know, I'm totally good with mammos AND MRIs.  I just don't want to be dependent on the mammo alone because my history with them is not good.  But I do believe they have their place and will not avoid them (they're not so bad, IMO), I just want the peace of mind the MRI will give me thrown in to the mix every once in a while.  (Do I sound like a head case, or what???) Oh, and I ordered 3 bras.  I'm not a big fan of online shopping unless I have experience with a retailer and know their sizing and whatnot, but it seems to be the best place for these compression garments.   So, I'll try them all and return what I don't like and hope I hit the jackpot with at least one.  Stay tuned. Carol, I'm finding that my scar tissue is finally going down-2 months after rads!  It got all hard and swollen during rads, sometimes causing discomfort because I couldn't put my arm down.  But it IS getting better-so keep the faith.  (Hydrate/lubricate/exercise) Happy dancin' with ya, CathyCA!!!  Good news on the scans.  And even more good news for your sons.  It sounds like things are purposefully moving forward for your family.  A big \u2018ol sloppy WoooHooo your way!  (The concert sounds fun.  How can you not like Guess Who and BTO music?  Takes you back.) Hey Julie, I'll be hoping the rain stays away from your neck of the woods so you can get out on your boat.  Sounds like you haven't had a chance so much this summer.  And your exchange is on the 29th?  Another one who'll be in recoup while I'm on cation-I know life goes on while I'm away, but gosh, I'll be such a worrywart! OMGosh, Diana, your puppy :) is TOTALLY adorable!  I'm with you, I love that baby smell.  But I love the fact that you can give them back to their parents when they make other, yucky, smells! Kris, not sure what gets the toxins out.  But I can TOTALLY relate to how you feel.  About the only thing I can recommend is water.  I'm a total convert to the goodness of hydration.  What's up with your toes?  Are you losing nails, too?  So far I've lost two (not sure I told you guys that my big toenail on my right foot popped off over the 4th weekend).  I'm not happy about that. Well, off to check my email.  Funny how I come here first.  Have a good weekend, Jewels. D1",

Oh, and need to share my heartfelt thanks to dh's assistant.  She's doing the 3-day in Chicago and her team had shirts made up.  They're walking to honor about 12 women who have battled bc and have the women's names on the backs of their shirts.  They have included my name!  I'm actually overwhelmed by this...

Paula, glad to hear your dh is frisky.  I actually went out and bought some of that warming KY jelly today.  I was lurking around on the \"mojo\" thread and several women there swear by it.  It's been a while since I've put that body part to use and I don't want excess chafing to hinder things, iykwim.  I'm hoping that the KY doesn't reach its expiration date before I use it.  That would be a real slap in the face. Thanks for the times you can play.  I'm going to shoot for the Sunday time, since 8:30pm is getting close to my bedtime...  I think I'll try to remember to pm you my phone numbers (home and cell) and if you'd do the same, we can nail things down as we get closer.  So when do you arrive in the area?  On Saturday?  I'm really excited to meet you! Wow, your ds is looking at much larger schools than my two.  College girl's school is about 2,400 and it appears dd is headed in the same direction.  The nice thing about the larger school is that they can offer so much more to their students.  All of these smaller schools keep talking about the consortiums they've formed with other small schools, but what kid actually goes off campus to take a class at another college?  I never woulda done that. Sounds like you filled your dance card on your day off, KathyL.  I'm not too worried about the BRCA thing, to be honest.  It is what it is.  I'm not even sure it will help me much as I fully expect to get the best screening possible as a bc survivor, anyway.  But we'll see.  I think it will affect my sisters (and of course, my daughters) more than me. Okay you guys.  Dd raked me over the coals this morning when I mentioned that I didn't sleep AGAIN last night.  She told me to stop being a baby and try the Tylenol PM for the 5 nights the onc recommended.  So tonight, if I remember (I conveniently forget it), I will take the Tylenol and see if it helps.  I think I'm afraid it won't and then I have to use Ambien, which sounds scary to me (I'm not a very good druggie-except in college, but that was different).  Can I say I still hate this? So 4,000 steps in a day, Kimberly?  That sounds like a lot.  I wonder how many Carol will put on her soles this weekend????? Speaking of Carol, YOU GOT DIAMONDS????!!!!  Way to go, girl!!!  Sounds like dh and ds both know how to bring out the sap in you.  Gotta love that.  (Oh, and I love the dh's story behind the rocks.)  Like everyone here, I'll say you are one of the kindest people I've had the pleasure to know, so it makes me happy for you to be the one getting the treats for a change.  You will have the best thoughts of the Jewels walking with you on your 3day.  Hang in there.  (Oh, and take the beer out of your pack-maybe they'll carry it for you on the sweep bus.)  Be safe and pay attention to your body.  Most of all, have fun.  You kicked cancer's ass and now you get to celebrate!!!! Ima go take my shower finally.  Although I don't know why-I've been to the gym and then ran all my errands on the way home in my sweaty state, so the world has seen me in my filthiness today.  Dh is on a biz trip (he flew on 9/11 and took off right before 9am-too freaky for me), so it's just me and dd today.  I think I'll make her favorite enchiladas for dinner.

So, on Tuesday, my MLD (manual lymph drainage) machine arrives.  This thing goes for $10,000, but for some reason, my insurance covers the whole thing (they won't cover a wig, though).  I've used it twice and must admit that it seems to help.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep up with it, but I'm going to try, since the alternative is swelling.  It takes an hour for the thing to go through the program.  It's not so bad (actually, kinda relaxing, if I allow myself to relax), but it's boring!  Today I talked to college girl and my mom while it was running, but I'm going to have to come up with something else.  Really, if there's a Jewel that would like to take the le for a while, I'd be most grateful... Sherry, thanks for the kind words about the pix.  I really hope you get your benefits straightened out.  It seems like you go from the fuel to the fire. Jenn, the fact that you check in every once in a while says to me that you're working toward a better place.  You should know that we're here to do what we can for you.  I hope you can leave the darkness behind real soon.  (Are you talking to your docs about this?  Maybe they can help????) Thanks, Joan.  I appreciate the encouragement.  Is your hair getting curlier?  It was pretty curly when I saw it!  I'm not very good with hair (luckily, I don't have much right now), so maybe you should check in with your stylist for ideas on how to tame it.  Just think, in a couple years when it straightens out again, you'll be pining for this curly hair! SIS Kimberly-don't you know that you're supposed to stand up in the juror's box and espouse your belief in the death penalty for all criminals to get out of jury duty?????  (Actually, I haven't tried that one, do you think it would work?)  So I talked to my sis tonight.  She's really trying hard to be brave, but the tears are closeby.  She admitted that thoughts of not beating cancer this time darken her doorway way too much.  Hopefully I convinced her to try the mood drugs her onc gave her.  Even though I'm not a very good druggie, I do promote them to others!  She should have all of her testing completed on the 23rd and we're hoping that she'll have the results that day, as well.  I hated the waiting for my own results, so I know where she is right about now.  We did realize one weird coincidence-I was dx'd on Aug. 17 and she discovered her first lump 3 years ago on Aug. 17 and discovered this second lump on Aug. 17 this year.  I told her that maybe she and I needed to start a new (more fun) tradition for Aug. 17 in the future!  Anyway, she was really touched (and choked up) when I told her that the Jewels were pulling for her.  (I wonder if there's a discussion board out there for Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients?  There must be.  Maybe I'll look into that for her.) Hmmm.  There seems to be something up with my computer so I'm going to close for now. He's guilty, SIS Kim, guilty as sin! D1",

Anyhoo, I told her on Monday about SIS Kimberly's Super Cape.  I mentioned that Kimberly wished she still had it so she could confer the magical healing powers.  Turns out my sis had a red cape in her house and she decided that simply by wishing to confer magical powers, SIS Kimberly did so.  So my sis wore her cape on Monday to her tests and again yesterday for her CT scan and visit with her doc.  She's convinced it helped with the \"no recurrence\" dx, so many, many thanks to SIS Kimberly!!!!! Back to school night was fun for a change.  I guess it was the giddiness of all the senior parents who were doing it for the last time (many of dd's friends are the baby of their family, too).  And dd did a great job with her presentation.  It was so nice to see her peers look to her for leadership and watch her respond to parents questions by looking them in the eye and speaking clearly (okay, she used the word \"like\" a lot, but we told her about it and it's something to work on for the future).  I particularly liked her AP Enviro Sci teacher-I was glad we were able to sneak her into his class.  The English teacher is probably the weakest link this year (which is a shame as it's dd's favorite), but I told dd to remember to focus on the content of the class and try to overlook/forgive her teacher for her scatter-brained ways. So today I'm going to shop around for my airline tix to Eleuthera.  I'm hoping I can use some miles to get some relief on the price (it's more than I anticipated).  Turns out my dh is on travel for 2 days while I'm gone, but dd has agreed to have her grandparents come over to take care of her so I can go.  (I hope the old people are going to be around to do it...)  And college girl is forgiving the fact that I won't be there for parents' weekend at her school as long as I drive up to take her to lunch some Thursday before I go (she has no classes on Thursdays).  It seems I'm going to miss a brunch at her sorority house, but I'm sure her father can represent for both of us.  So I think my trip's a GO!  (Now I'm starting to sweat the bugs and the thought of sleeping on people's couches for 10 days...) About it for me.  Guess I need to marshal my basketball booster troops soon.  I ran in to one of the coaches last night and they're chomping at the bit to order stuff for their teams and want to know how much money I'll give them from the boosters for the coming season.  (Everyone always wants money!) Onward through the fog... D1 Oh, Carol, I seem to be okay with photobucket.  I got the one picture sized okay, but I tried something different with the other one and I must've screwed it up somehow. I probably could have gotten it okay, but I just lost patience, truth be told.  Thanks for the assist.",

So, what's up? Sherry, I see you posted at about the same time I did the other day and I missed you in my shouts.  I want to go back to you, though, because you're losing toenails.  You may not remember, but I ended up losing 8 of my toenails.  All the small toes are grown in, now (I lost them end of June, early July).  The only ones still working on it are the big toes.  The healthy nail is about 2/3 of my nail bed now and each nail ends in a humpy nail-like thing that looks like it's eventually going to come off, too.  This humpy part was nail underneath the nail that popped off.  None of it has been painful (although I still have some neuropathy on the exposed/tip of my big toes).  I've been using a polish that pretty much matches my skin, so no one's attention is drawn to my toenails.  Yep, FU taxotere! Hey Maz, glad you made it through your trip to FL.  Losing a parent really sucks, but your silver lining seems to be a new relationship with your dad's wife.  Do your best to enjoy her and the memories she has of your father.  And I wish for you a much better year-one filled with positives!  (The tumor markers are certainly a good start.) Are you kidding, Therese?  You got your period back for your birthday????  Hmmm.  Not sure I'd be as upbeat about it as you are... LJ-I TRIED to get a case manager a while back.  It was confusing to keep track of all the crap that was out of plan (it still is-all my compression shit is not covered).  Not sure why they're contacting you now, maybe they're slow (ya think???). Oh, there's CathyCA piling on to the \"they're just running a tad behind\" theory. CARLA!!!!  How great to hear from you!  It's been too long.  You looked and sounded FABO on the news.  I'd be such a nervous wreck if I did something like that.  WTG! Kris-there is nothing common about you, girlfriend.  Take care of your cold.  (I remember hanging on every word when we were describing our bowels-we've come a long way!) OMG, Paula, I am totally LOL (no, more like a cackle) over the stud muffin boxers.  How funny is that???!  And then, you say all Julie wants for Xmas is her two front nips-you are ROLLING, girl! Kimberly.  Oh no.  I don't even know what to say. I'm sorry, guys.  I don't feel much like posting now.  I'll be back. D1",

CHJ-your hair looks great!!  And where are you?  Kinda resemble the scenic overlook on 270, but I don't remember anywhere where you can get out on the rocks. SIS Kimberly-I'm so glad you were there to get the MRI for your twinsis.  It's much better to catch it now.  We'll all be eager to hear how she decides to proceed as we'll want to send her our Jewel Jewce (hmm, I was getting creative with the alliteration and spelling of \u2018juice.' Does it work???).  This is the tough time-figuring out what to do.  Our thoughts are with her as she makes her first decisions. I started asking questions about massage today.  I think it will have to wait till I find a doc to write me a script for it.  I want to use the wellness center at the hospital so they can do my MLD at the same time and I need a doc for that.  I'll ponder it.  And I was perturbed with myself for forgetting to pick up the flyer on the yoga classes today, maybe I'll remember on Thursday when I'm over there next time.  Still in the talking about it phase with the therapy.  I think I'll wait to start that one till I get back from the Bahamas.  I did talk to dh today (oh, he's on his way out your direction-Seattle tonight and tomorrow, Portland on Weds, Sacramento on Thurs, San Jose on Fri and then the red eye home), and told him that I want to see someone to discuss our situation and asked him if he'd be up for joining me if appropriate.  He agreed.  I take that as a good sign. Hang in there on the weight.  As you know, sometimes it bounces around a little.  I've been stuck on the last 5 pounds for months!  In fact, I put on 3 lbs about 3 weeks ago and I think I may finally be backing off that now.  I'd love to lose that last 5 so I don't have to buy some new pants this winter-I've tried on my old ones and they're just too tight in the crotch and around the waistband.  I can't wear them, yet.  With colder weather coming, I've got to do something quick!!  You'll get there.  I suspect the Wii Fit thingy will help! Do you think the magnetic bracelet would do more good if you'd stop shoveling gravel, Carol????  I see you were watching the \u2018Hawks yesty-you guys can't catch a break with your professional sports teams, can you?  You saw dh will be in your neck of the woods tonight.  His plane takes off from here around 6p and he lands in Sea-Tac at 11:30, or something equally stupid for a 52 year old man.  Keep him in line, would ya? Hope the Sylvan eval went okay today.  I hope ds is in the mood to be helped-with teens I found that to be the larger battle.  I know he doesn't want to be harped on by your bald (well, not so much anymore!) lady friends, but pull out my thuggin' picture and tell him I said this year is important for college!  Do his homework-that's the gimme part of the grade!  (It'll help when it comes time for the tests, too, I promise.) Brag corner!!!!!  College girl got her first philosophy grade emailed from her prof-she scored 100% on her test!!!  That's a third of her grade!!!  Shit, I don't even understand philosophy!  (She needs some good grades to go abroad.  She finished her freshman year with a 2.7 and needs a 3.0 to go overseas-yikes!) Hope you have a good week getting ready for homecoming.  Dd said the dinner before her dance was a lot of fun.  One of her friends figured out the tip and what everyone owed and dd said the server came back to the table four times to thank them, so she figured her friend over-calculated.  Not what the server expected from a table of high school girls, I'm sure!  They arrived at the dance 10 minutes before they closed the doors (they don't let anyone in to the dances at our high school after 10p).  Someone said they were cutting it close and dd said, \u2018no, if it were nine minutes from now, it would be close!'  Smart ass.  She said the music was lame and too many chaperones, but their group danced anyway and apparently hopped around yelling, \u2018Oh-nine!' to let everyone know they were the seniors!  She was home by 11:30p and happy as a clam.  May your experience this weekend go just as well. Oh, I remember the parties, KathyL.  They're so much fun.  I always loved how my kids would jabber on during the car rides about all the drama a 5 year old (or whatever) could have.  It makes you remember how unimportant your own concerns are.  We def need a photo of your new \u2018do!  It's so much fun to be girly again, isn't it? So happy you and dh had a good experience with Robin Roberts.  I'm always so impressed with her when I tune in to ABC.  I hope the book is as good as her talk. Hey, Carol, did you see that?  KathyL is having her port removed under twilight sedation.  Is that something you can have so you only have to pull your big girl panties on halfway???? I dunno Sherry, I think I'd want sludge and acids out!  But I do know what you mean about the medical appointments! Deb-totally AWESOME re: the Little Rock numbers!  Isn't it great to participate in those events?  So reaffirming.  Even to those like me who are not so much in to the \"pink.\"  It's wonderful that you connected with so many.  I'd love to see some pictures. I think I'll go clean the green beans so I can be ready to roll on dinner when the girls get home.  It'll be kinda fun to just be the three girls tonight! D1",

So today I put the call in to my oncologist to ask for a script for the massage therapy and a referral to a head therapist.  Hmmm. CHJ-a 1.5 mile hike?  Hope it was on a trail.  I don't mind trail hiking, but that off-trail stuff when you have to battle your way through spider webs is for the birds.  (Did I mention that I'm kinda afraid of spiders?  It's spiders and needles for me!)  I love the Shenandoah, we've done lots of hiking and cabining in the Shenandoah.  Looks like your weather was perfect that day.  What a great way to get out and celebrate! Great news on the Sylvan experience, Carol!  I hope ds is able to keep up with it.  It will be hard to cut back on the work hours, they so love to have some money in their pockets, but priorities have to win out.  My dd just quit her job to focus on college apps and to get ready for basketball, so we're going through the financial weaning here, too. I cannot wait to tag along on a West Coast trip!  This was not the one-too many moving parts.  I'll get there, keep the faith.  (Oh, I leave for Eleuthera on Oct. 25 and return on Nov. 2.) So you liked the yoga?  I'm going to try to see if I can find a flyer on it tomorrow when I'm at the hospital for my p/t.  I called a friend who has wanted to do yoga for a couple of years and she's interested in doing it with me.  I'll see.  It would be great if the yoga and massage help with your se's.  Hey, we'll have to start a thread for yoga-fied, massaged noodles! Oh, Carla, I'm so sorry you're still dealing with a DH.  Please take care of yourself and figure out what YOU need.  Vent here anytime.  We're in your corner. OMG, Carol, LOL at your \"stiff as a board\" comment.  Get in line behind me, my dear.  I'm so impressed you were able to connect.  At the conference I attended on Saturday, they had a demo of guided imagery and I found myself drifting off, organizing my \"to do\" lists.  What a loser. Julie, it sounds like you guys worked hard on your day \"off.\"  It's fun to accomplish so much, isn't it?  I remember a time, not too long ago, when you were supervising.  I'm glad you're in the thick of things and doing okay.  How's the new \u2018do? KathyL, you make me LOL.  YOUR ass has a new zip code?  You're too young for that, girl. So, Deb, you're working on building up your time off bank?  Good for you.  Four day weeks every other sounds sweet.  You deserve it.  Just don't try to cram 5 days' work into those four, okay?  As a veteran toenail faller offer, it doesn't hurt.  It's just ugly.  Keep \u2018em really short and maybe you can avoid the whole scene... I'm psyching up for the final debate.  I'm waiting to see some punches.  Guess I'll go watch some pundits for a half hour and see what they have to say. Lata. D1",

Unfortunately, while we were on the island (mostly without phone service), one call that got through was from my NM sister's onc (she's the one who had Hodgkin's Lymphoma 3 years ago and recently discovered a new lump).  Apparently, after reviewing her test results, they have decided that she needs to have the lump surgically removed for more testing.  (I mean, we couldn't seem to get calls through to our families, but the onc managed to find us!)  My sister will be calling to schedule that surgery later this week (she came home in time to vote and repack for a business trip).  I'm glad I was with her when she got the call.  I know IF she has to do this again, I'll be much better equipped to support her than I was before my own cancer journey. Speaking of my cancer journey, waiting for me upon my return was a letter from the VA DMV saying they were rejecting my request for a license plate bearing the personalization \"O FUBC\" on the grounds they thought it might be construed as lewd.  Ya think???!!!  I'm peeved.  Now I have to come up with a new personalization and I can't think of anything I'd rather have.  Your suggestions are welcome.  Maybe you'll get my creative juices flowing. So what have you guys been up to?  Hooray to CathyCa on a good mammo!!!  One more hurdle cleared.  Now it sounds like you're full on into your training for your 3day.  Keep us posted on your progress. SISKimberly-I totally hear you on the impatience to get back to normal.  Quite frankly, I think that IS normal.  I do understand the whole \"tears of a clown\" gig, though.  Please vent any old time. I'm also wondering how Kathleen's consult with the surgeon went.  It was yesterday, right? Gosh darn it, Paula, what's up with the heart?  I know you must be stressed out-everytime you post your agenda it makes MY heart palpitate.  PLEASE take care of yourself.  Mention this to one of your docs.  We worry about you. Very eloquent, Carol.  With Kimberly's start, you really took off and put our feelings in to words.  I think what you wrote is why I'm trying to get a script for a therapist.  While I really, really need you guys to help me on my journey, I think I have some more stuff that needs professional attention in the hope that I can not only get back to the physical normal I enjoyed 18 months ago, but also the mental normal I've left behind many years ago. LJ!!!  Yes, I hear you on the bone mets fear!  I awoke one morning with a pain in my ribs and was convinced something was really wrong.  I tried to ignore it for a couple of days and only casually mentioned it to my physical therapist, but it wouldn't go away and I didn't want to appear stupid by talking about it.  I ended up skipping situps and any exercise that seemed to be aggravating it and it did go away.  But my head is a scary place these days. OMG, Norma!  A cyst on your ovary!  What do they do for that?  I really wish this weren't happening to you. KathyL, thanks for the encouragement re: therapy.  I really don't know how you do it all and still have time for the Jewels! Gosh, Sherry, you're really having a time of it, aren't you?  I hope as you settle in to your new job things will improve. Love your optimism in getting over the Jewel Sapphires (Blues), Therese.  Thanks for helping us keep it in perspective.  And you can steal my ideas any ol' day.  I live by the words, \"there is no such thing as a new idea, the difficulty is to think of it again.\"  I think it was Thomas Wolfe who said that, but don't quote me.  Ideas for the survival bag-Biotene mouth wash, Colace, immodium, lotion, lip balm, A+D ointment for q-tipping in a dried out nose, good smelling shower gel (because it makes you happy), um, that's all that's top of mind... Hooray for heavy twilight, Carol!  Glad you pursued it.  So we'll mark our calendars... Hey, I'm sorry dh wasn't on the same page when you tried to communicate your feelings.  I've had a couple of disappointments in that regard.  Heck, I'm disappointed trying to communicate my happy thoughts (reference my comments about being with my sisters in the opening paragraph).  Somehow it's just different once you've walked a mile in the shoes.  I don't know why, but it is.  I think we should continue to try to connect with the mere humans in our lives, but really, let's face it, the Jewels get it. Hooray to Therese and SISKim for their cyber empathy. LJ, you just da bomb, gf!  Okay, bring on those hot flashes! Hey, CHJ, thanks for the perspective.  Your input is always so spot on.  Try to stop in more often. LOL, Julie!!! Carla, I sense some moving forward in your post.  Good for you.  And I still think Pippi Longstocking was a hippie... I really like the way you handled your socializers, SISKimberly.  The cause and effect lesson they will receive will likely stick with them forever. (Oh, and I liked your comments to Julie about her poop system!) You remind me, my sisters and I dressed for Halloween, too.  We all wore green t-shirts with a large \"P\" drawn on the front.  Then we each gave ourselves one black eye.  We were the \"Black Eyed Peas!\"  Get it???  It was fun having people guess. Great entry from our poet laureate!!! Good to hear from you, Joan.  I hope you're getting more and more obedient in your classes every day!  (I imagine Lucy's a very good teacher!)  ;) I love the story behind the butterfly tattoo, Carla!  Although, with my needle phobia, the only tattoos I'll have are the four rad dots running across my chest-good news is that one shows up when I wear v-neck clothing, so I can point out that it's a tattoo to those who would be amused by such things and feel very cool, indeed. Hey Deb, Ima gonna bitch slap the next person who says \"at least you're alive.\"  Geesh. Paula, I'm not happy reading about Ed.  Particularly when it seems he was doing so well for a while, there.  Does his med team have any idea why he'd be having these problems?  Are they related to his tx? Oh, speaking of things medical, my appointment with my radonc has been moved to tomorrow.  So I imagine I'll be out of pocket pretty much all day (gym in the a.m., appointment with my legu at noon, then the radonc).  I'll let you know what he says.  I'm going to try to stop by my onc's while I'm at the hospital and see if I can't shake some scripts outta him. Don't forget to vote, everyone! XOXO D1",

Ah, yes, there's the mention of your \"de-porting\" (lol).  I love those warm blankets-the only good thing to be had in a surgery, imo. Darn it all, anyway!  Why does the ds have to do his weird teenage shit when you leave town?  Does he want you hanging in his business all the time????  Tell him it's time to straighten up and fly right.  You and his dad are tired of being disappointed, particularly when he seems to be moving along so well.  Maybe you all need to come up with a more constructive way for him to decompress whenever the whole \"being a teen\" scene gets overwhelming.  Would he be receptive to talking about options with you guys?  (Why is it so hard to be a teen?  You'd think with all the years humanity has been working on it, that it would improve, but NOOOOOOOO!) Yellow Bird-the rum drink with crème de banana, orange juice and pineapple juice.  You drink too many of them before you realize you're wasted... Well, maybe your sleeve fits okay, then.  I will say, I HATE wearing my compression every day and really look forward to about 7p when I allow myself to take it off.  The sick part is that when I take off the big bra, I can't just go braless-too much of a shock to the system-but wearing a regular bra feels great.  How sad is that???!!!!  I remember the day when I'd shed the regular bra at 7p and felt like the world was right again... Okay, I'll try to relax about the boyfriend for college girl.  I guess I don't really have to deal with it till he comes for dinner over Thanksgiving break... CathyCA, good for your doc in being so thorough.  I really like having all the testing done for my peace of mind.  I imagine you're getting the same comfort from your medical care.  Oh, and I know exactly how you feel about having buried your chemo memories.   When we were in the Bahamas, one of my old friends was really curious about chemo and I found myself describing some of the se's and, in the back of my mind, wondering where on Earth I found the strength to deal with them.  I hope your MIL finds the strength, too.  Oh, got a smile out of your ds' charges from Claire's.  And our kids think we're stupid... Good luck for your 3day!  I'll be there in spirit (and marveling at your wisdom in forgoing the tenting experience). Reminder to Carol-you're supposed to stay AHEAD of the pain.  Take the scripts and some colace.  Maybe you can use it as an excuse to call in sick tomorrow... Paula-I cannot imagine you doing the 80 year old shuffle-you are as vibrant as anyone I've ever met!  Oh, I do hear you on the whole boyfriend scene.  I want to talk to my college girl about boyfriends (this is her first relationship-unless you count the high school years she spent pining for this kid) and how you are still \"you\" and don't have to become anything else to please this other person.  I want her to know that her goals and dreams should not change to accommodate anyone else-it's okay to achieve things as an individual-couples can still celebrate the individual successes a partner has and still be a couple.  You know, that kind of thing.  I'm just afraid I might blow it because she'll see right through to my disappointment that she's with this guy.  I'm going to have to keep it in check.  I remember from my own teen years, anything my parents really wanted me to do, I did exactly the opposite (and I wasn't particularly rebellious). Oh, and you guys want to see drinking smiles?  You should see the photos we took after we'd finished our Yellow Birds!  Those are not fit for the internet!!! I'm off to the in-laws this afternoon to watch the Vikings.  My fil has the football package so we can see the Vikes every weekend.  It really chews up the time I'd spend puttering around the house, but it is fun to watch the games (and if they're willing to pay for the package, I'm all for it!).  Tomorrow I get my next massage-I am SO looking forward to it! Later. D1",

Man, life sure gets in the way of my Jewel time.  I'm not sure I like that too much.  I've been spending WAY too much time getting ready for the Booster snack bar to open tomorrow.  That, coupled with trying to convince all of the parents to join this year, has kept me from playing in the streets.  Some really good basketball news is that dd got some decent playing time in the season opener last Tues. night and was the second highest scorer.  More important to me was watching her help her teammates on the court-calling out picks, alerting teammates to cutters, helping on defense, etc.  It was all good.  I hope the rest of the season goes as well. I'm still dicking around with whether or not to return to the LCSW I saw before Thanksgiving.  As a result of my visit with her, I had an honest heart-to-heart with my dh and even though he whined that it was \"pick on him night\" he took it in stride (at least I think he did).  Anyway, things seem to be much better with him now.  He's sharing his thoughts and asking my opinions, just like the old days.  I don't know if all I needed was a jump start from the LCSW to encourage me to confront my demons and just talk about how I honestly feel, or if this is a temporary fix.  I'm tempted to wait and see, but some of you have more experience with therapy, so I'd love to hear what you think.  Deb, I really appreciated your comments.  Given this development, do you have more to say? And Kimberly, I'm not sure if ending the drought was dealing with my feelings or what (heck, I'm not sure if he even knew it was me!!! ;) ), but we do seem to have a new closeness.  I hope it doesn't go away... LJ, very cool dining set.  When you described as retro, I didn't imagine it properly.  I really like how it looks like you could use it casually, or dress it up.  If you care, I approve.  :) Hey Carla, my sister, (she's a 3 year Hodgkin's Lymphoma survivor), just had an us of her thyroid this week and they told her the same thing about the mass size.  She had 3 masses and they declined to biopsy any of them.  She goes back in 6 months for another us.  I'll be curious to hear what your onc says to you. Carol, Carol, Carol.  Your call was quite timely.  I appreciated the ear and hearing about your goings on.  So sorry yoga whipped your tiny little ass, but it's good for you. So, are we looking at a Jewel Junta (you know me, a sucker for alliteration, even though the \"j\" in junta is \"h-like...\"), in early July? Gosh, Julie, you are certainly plagued by those migraines, aren't you?  Glad you're on the other side of it.  Aren't teens a hoot??  I can't believe my oldest will be 20 in February!!!! Let's all sing the Goodby song to Kris' lefty.  (Nah, nah, nah, nah, go-od-bye!!!!)  Be well, Kris.  We're thinking of you. I forgot you had a Christmas cruise coming up, CathyCA!  I really liked Mayan ruins-although I hear you can no longer climb up on the pyramids at Chichen Itza.  Bummer.  It sounds like you have a lot of fun activities planned for your adventure-have a great time!  (How was the MRI?) Guess I should check on dinner-dd will be home from practice soon and she's usually starving! Onward. D1",

My onc thinks my se's are too much, so he's going to try a new drug.  I'm not happy about it and told him so, but he seems to think I should not just \"gut\" the se's out.  So he's giving me Megace (I haven't Googled it, yet).  This is the first one we're going to try.  If it doesn't work, he's threatening Effexor.  I'm wary of that drug as I've heard folks say it levels your moods out-sounds like a chemical lobotomy to me.  The whole thing has made me a little angst-y.  Other than that, he thinks I'm doing okay and don't need to see him for 3 months.  Oh, and Carol, he suggested I have the CT scan done, too, so I'm going to schedule that. So, speaking of Carol, how was your dinner with Kalen?  Is she holding up okay?  I remember when she chirped in on our thread a few times till she found another group on her same schedule.  I hope she's doing okay. Paula-LOVE the new avatar!  Your hair looks great!  Do you still have that issue with the cowlick in the back sticking the wrong way?  I think of you every morning when I'm trying to tame mine.  So Ed should be in his chemo break now.  I hope he's feeling better.  Are the steroids helping? KathyL-Sounds like your birthday was lowkey.  Is the dh recovered?  I'll bet you guys will celebrate soon.  Yeah, I imagine going off the herceptin brings mixed feelings.  It's so weird how one day our docs tell us we're sick and there's a great flurry of activity, and then, suddenly, we're better.  And all we have to show for it are some scars (okay, new boobs in your case).  Very discombobulating. Kris, your follow up is in a couple of days.  I hope you're doing well and that your fruit punch production is starting to wane. So then there's Carol again, overdoing it.  Will you ever learn????  A new washer/dryer sounds like fun-sort of... Holy mackerel, Julie, sounds like your puppies really gave you guys a scare!!!  I can hear your relief that they were found safe and sound.  You made me smile with your comment about Christmas decorations.  It took me three days to get mine all up and we haven't even gotten our tree, yet! Thanks for weighing in on the therapist, CathyCA.  I haven't called her back, yet.  I'm still trying to figure out if she's the right person or not.  I'm sure the path will become clear one of these days. Thanks for sharing the photos!  You look fab!  And I really liked the one with the \"dog angel.\"  (And may I say walking along the ocean like that must have been a little moving!)  I can only imagine what an experience the 3day is.  I'm really glad for you that you were able to participate. Good to hear from you, Maz!  Actually, it's a good thing that you're too busy to hang out on the thread.  And another birthday girl.  You sparkle, Maz.  Happy Birthday!!! Oh, dd just came in from practice and I want to hear about her day.  Till next time, D1",

      "Content": "Dec 17, 2008 04:40PM Determined1 wrote: We're getting all chatty again!  How fun! Sorry to be MIA.  I was all in to the Megace monitoring and getting ready for Christmas.  So here's my deal with the Megace.  It appears that there is a period of 2-4 hours during the day that I notice my heart races a bit and that I'm short of breath after doing something like going upstairs.  This starts about 4-5 hours after I take the Megace.  Other than that, I'm finding I feel overly caffeinated, kinda jittery.  I'm talking faster and probably too much.  I haven't taken the time to call the onc with this development, as it's something I can live with.  And I only have to try this for a month and then we'll take it from there.  I'm hoping I'll have a few moments to call the onc before this week is out to report. Dh was talking to a colleague of his and discovered that the guy's wife had breast cancer about 7 years ago and took Tamoxifen, too.   He said that the Tamox caused his wife to have a serious depression for the entire 5 years she took the drug, but that they both believed in the power of Tamox, so they gutted it out.  I cannot imagine doing that, given how low this drug is making me feel.  It was, however good for my dh to hear from one of his peers how these drugs can mess you up.  I just hope the Megace (or something else) works to balance out the Tamox without causing me too much weight gain (this from the woman who ate a ginormous pastrami sandwich for lunch...). So, my bad news.  Dd was rejected from Vassar.  She's handling it very well (better than me, who burst into tears at the sight of the little envelope).  She's putting together her strategy from here.  First, Wesleyan in CT,  then Pomona in CA.  Then Emerson in MA (a safety school for her).  After that, it looks like it's wide open.  I think she's also talking about Colorado College, Emory University, Skidmore College, and in a nod to her parents' alma mater, Kalamazoo College in MI.  I'm hopeful she'll also look at something in VA, since the tuition would be a bit easier on the wallet... She did take her frustrations out a little in the basketball game immediately following the news:  she had 4 fouls in about 4 minutes and ended up sitting for most of the game (still managed 2 points and 2 rebounds, so it wasn't a total shipwreck)... Julie-how much fun is that, that I was able to fool you!!!!  Glad you liked the music.  I was a little shaky on it as you said you liked top 40 and country, but I figured some of the best pop/alternative songs from the last year would be acceptable.  Don't you love that track by Brand New, \"Fork and Knife?\"  Their music can tend to be a little loud and angsty for me most of the time, but they have a couple of cross-over songs (as dd would describe them) that I really like.  I also like Tegan and Sara, who are twins from Canada-almost alternative folk, imo.  Anyway, glad you liked it.  Oh, and the peanuts are from Virginia-since it's my home, I figured they make a good \"reveal\" gift. Thanks for the input on the Effexor.  Believe it or not, when my onc described my options, the se's from the Megace sounded less offensive than those of Effexor!  I'm hoping I can make this drug work-if I gain over 40 lbs I'll be suicidal!!!! My college girl suffers from migraines, too.  (Hey, didn't I just hear somewhere that migraine sufferers are at a reduced risk for bc?  I guess you shoot that theory right out of the water.)  She takes a drug called Replax (I think that's right).  Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't.  She considers it a victory when the migraine just becomes a severe headache after her meds. Oh, and you're crazy having all those boys over... Carol, I'm so sorry to hear about ds' bad spill.  I sure hope the injuries are quick-healing as qualifiers for Nationals will be coming up in a couple of months, won't they?? Shit, LJ, that's why I'm a dog person.  (Not that my dog couldn't go all Cujo, but I doubt it.)  Doesn't peroxide always foam?  Not sure on that, perhaps there will be others with more knowledge weighing in.  All in all, it's not a bad thing to get your tetanus up to date (although that shot can be sore for a few days-keep your arm working to minimize the soreness).  Have you let kitty out of the doghouse, yet? Aha, there's a guru with the foaming peroxide answer right there!  Thanks, KathyL. Somehow I can't imagine you going all Griswold, Paula!  The lights and bows sound downright tasteful.  I always thought our Christmas decorations were a little on the lame side, but dd has been lunching at friends' houses this year (seniors can go off campus for lunch and dd's gang is smart-they rotate going to each other's house so they don't have to buy their lunch), and says we have way more decorations than her pals.  Who knew? Oh, and don't feel sheepish about getting your knickers in a twist over a suspicious lump.  Think of what we've been through!  And then I can't help but remember how you described that you and Ed have been bouncing the poor health ball back and forth for a while...  I think if anyone has a right to be anxious about health, it's you! Isn't Williamsburg fun at Christmas time, CHJ?  We went down there a few years ago to look at the decorations.  When we returned I was determined to decorate my house with fruit, but I've never managed to get that together.  It probably wouldn't match with my architecture, anyway... Pumpkin cheesecake bread????  Mmmmm.  Even without the appetite stimulant that sounds delicious.  Does it count that I made homemade dog biscuits cut with holiday cookie cutters today?  Our dog sends them out to the neighbor dogs every year so they don't sniff her butt for the rest of the year. Snow day, Julie?!  My dd would kill for a snow day.  She was hoping for some ice overnight so she could have a 2 hour delay today, but no luck.  She ended up skipping her first period anyway to get some sleep.  Poor kid has been so stressed out about Vassar that she hasn't been sleeping well. Ooooo, damn, Carol.  The ds' knee does not sound good.  How's he handling it?  (And you got him 3 shots on top of it?  That's just mean, Carol.) A big ole WOOOOHOOOO for SISKathleen!!!  You must all be relieved at those path reports.  Is she doing rads?  I'll bet a good amount that her onc will recommend Tamox since she's not doing chemo... I think the week after July 4 weekend would be okay.  There's nothing on my calendar, yet... LOL at the subtleties of white, SISKimberly!  We haven't made any progress recently, although we've talked about the fact that the next step is for the two of us to go to the tile store together... Love your present idea.  It must make you guys feel really good to do things like that. So, damn, woman, your post is a tome!  But it's so refreshing to hear your voice. And then there's Carol, making me feel full of greed and avarice.  You really don't have material things on your Christmas list?  Mine was a mile long this year! I'm not feeling Branson, MO.  Sounds like schlocky dinner theater to me.  Chicago can be fun (tickets to a second city performance maybe?), but may be pricey.  (Although I could tack on a couple of extra days and visit my sister, who lives nearby.)  Didn't someone mention San Antonio?  I haven't been there in probably 30 years and I imagine the Riverwalk is all the better for the maturity.  To be honest, I don't have any real strong feelings.  I agree that we need to go somewhere with easy air service and a few distractions for us.  Like there may be some wine, music or art festivals going on in July that could be fun to attend as a group. I see you're still talking about your se's from Femara.  Maybe you can find a drug to take to alleviate them!  I know I shouldn't be the only one in the group taking 10 pills a day (yes, 10.  One is a multi vitamin, another is the Tamox, but the other 8 are all things to help with the Tamox se's.  Life's good!). And I am not revealing my postal secrets.  I'm not sure they always work the way I plan them, but when they do, it's fun! Ah, the needles.  During my chemo infusions I don't know if the needle was technically a child's needle or not.  I've only discovered that trick since I finished chemo.  I do remember them talking about how they were using the smallest they could.  But I think part of the trick there was that I was extremely well-hydrated when I went in (I'm still trying to do that before IVs and blood draws now) and they put a heating pad on my arm for about 15 minutes before they even tried to insert the IV.  They also spent a lot of time patting and massaging my arm before they inserted.  They were very patient with me.  Don't be timid in telling your nurse about your situation (I even had 2 of my onc nurses bring \"Dracula\" over to do the insertion because they could see the situation made me stressed and getting chemo is stressful enough, thank you very much).  And then just grip the waistband on those big girl panties with your other arm...yank hard...not too hard-danger of wedgies! Oh man, Kris.  I'm sorry you still have your tube.  Like I told you, be glad you have the tubes, though.  They may be just the ticket for avoiding some le down the road. Well, I hear college girl coming in the door.  I'll go see what she's up to and ask if she left any gas in my car... D1",

How ya doin' today, yuyu?  That da*n neulasta shot is a real kick in the pants, isn't it? Carol--get your butt in gear and exercise!  From previous postings, it sounds like you're as addicted to exercise as I am, so do it for your head!  I did an incredibly wimpy walk today (took me 35 minutes to do a mile + half), but by God, I did it.  My head is happy as a result.  I'm hoping for more tomorrow, and maybe even back to my beloved rec center to work out with the seniors on Weds.  (They make me feel like such a hotty, hot, hot!) May I say how indignant I am over the work situations for KathyL and Sheshe?  Remind me, in what century do we live????  That's just barbaric treatment.  I'm so sorry for both of you and hope that the financial hardships won't derail your full recovery in any way--not even for a minute. I'm hoping to see Charlie Wilson's War tomorrow.  Keeping fingers crossed that the chemo se's don't kick in, particularly now that I seem to have passed the worst of the nasty-lasta shot (do I really have to get 3 more of those????  No, no, let me rephrase--one down 3 to go--FUSE!!!)  And I'm with Kimberly--LOVED The Kite Runner as a novel and am a little shaky on seeing the movie.  It DID get good reviews, but I may wait for DVD as I'm sure I'm the only one in my house that would be interested in it.  The dh and 16year old watched the Marriage of Larry and Chuck, or whatever that Adam Sandler movie is, last night and har-harred their way through it.  I think everyone was ready for some simple slapstick and prepubescent humor.  Me?  I was in here trying to burb from my overeating...  Life's good. :) Vettegal--I saw someone talking about raising their arm to shave and it reminded me that I put my arm on the shower wall as high as I could to shave (actually, I'm still kinda doing that).  The wall helped to hold my arm up while I tried to get at whatever I could under there.  Try to remember it will pass soon.  You will get by, you will get by... So my dh is telling me that I smell like a dry cleaners now.  Guess that's better than a sewer... Today is better.  Just using max strength tylenol to stay ahead of the neulasta aches and am eating tiny amounts (piece of toast, then a banana, then 1/2 a sandwich, then slice of pizza, etc. almost every hour and a half without fail!) to stay ahead of nausea.  My tongue is thick and has some sores on it, but I'm trying to ignore them.  I'm swishing with the Biotene mouthwash after every food outing.  Think I'll go upstairs and shower and see if I can do my own hair.  I'm thinking I'll only have this cut for 10-12 days, bout the time I figure out how to do it, it'll be gone! FUSE! D1",

Got some errands to run while I have access to the car, so I gotta go, I just felt compelled to talk to AZDonna for a minute.  Hope to be back later today. D1",

SIS Kimberly--you go girl!  Keep that head pushing those se's away.  Even if it can't completely eliminate them, it will help lessen them.  Fingers are crossed you continue to be comfortable.  Let us know. LJ13 and Carol--how's it goin?  Glad your bloodwork was okay LJ13.  That's a huge concern of mine--that one of these times something won't be quite right and I'll have to postpone tx.  I've got my head all wrapped around my schedule and would have to make some serious adjustments if there was a change.  Please let us know how #2 goes, v. #1--you're our pioneer on that score! Therese--welcome!  There's always room for more in our club (did that come out right??).  You're going to want to go back a couple of pages to get info on our January Jewels t-shirts!  If you can't find it, let us know and we'll get you up to speed so you can order one if you want one. DanaC--Way to go with the \"A\"!!!  We'll keep your dad in our thoughts.  I'm so sorry your family has experienced so much cancer.  I'm always amazed to hear when a single family has so many cancer experiences.  It's not right.  I do believe you are going to be strong through your journey--and when you feel a little down, you know you can always lean on us for some support. Oh no, Vettegal!  You HAVE to get well!!  Please take care of yourself and get better soon.  Ommmmmmmm.  Sending you get well vibes. For everyone stocking up on se management tools, I have a new one.  When I saw my gyn the other day I complained about my dry, bloody nose.  He said to get some A+D ointment and put it on a q-tip and gently coat the insides of my nostrils with it.  The nose has settled from the first tx, but I got some today for tx #2.  Also picked up some of those flavored waters for when regular water starts to taste like foil/chemicals. So I realize that I've been having back spasms every day since my 2 days of incapacitation.  The spasms have been random and certainly manageable on a pain scale, but I'm realizing that they are there.  Gets me to thinking, I wonder if I asked for physical therapy or massage therapy (not usually one for a massage, but I could make an exception) if that would help.  I don't want to have to take more drugs than I have to and the problem with a muscle relaxant is that it'll make me loopy (I have enough problems already!).  Has anyone ever used physical/massage therapy for a spasm problem?  Do you think it would work?  Good thing is, if it doesn't, I still have the muscle relaxant as a backup. Hair report.  I still have some.  About 50 strands on the pillow this morning.  Haven't showered, yet, so can't give a report on that score.  (Don't judge--I went to the gym and ran a million errands and haven't had a chance, yet!)  Pubic hair is about half gone already--suspect that's cuz that area rubs on my clothes all the time and it rubbed the hair out.  I will say that a 50 year old unmentionable area is not as cute as those I saw on my baby girls!  That space was meant to have a blanket!!!!  Well, I should get off the soapbox and let someone else have a turn. The Jewels totally rock! D1",

PALady--welcome to our group!  You and I are on the same tx.  The nose and lip thing is really annoying, isn't it?  My nose was so dry it would bleed every time I blew my nose.  Yuck.  It did clear up about 5-6 days ago, so you are probably near the end of that se for this round.  I found out that you can put A&D Ointment on a Q-tip and gently coat the inside of your nostrils to help with the dryness there.  I'm going to try it with my next round.  For the lips, I just kept Burts Bees nearby and coated and recoated my lips.  I also found that some lipstick was helpful as it would stay on (and gave me some color when I was feeling like sh*t.)  I also had dryness issues with my eyes (when they weren't watering like mad--how's that for a contradiction?), but just took out my contacts and have been wearing glasses, which makes that se manageable.  Have your hands started to itch, yet?  Mine were making me totally crazy for about 3 days (used Sarna anti-itch lotion, which helped a little).  This carried on till my hair starting really coming out, then I was distracted by the hair and suddenly realized the hand thing passed.  It's all so fun, isn't it?  Anyway, welcome.  Feel free to share whatever--it's all good (to steal Vettegal's line). Therese--I loved your description of your energy level--that's exactly how I feel!  I have bursts, then a lull.  And I like the use of the word \"drained,\" cuz I'm not really tired as much as drained.  Your words will help me when I see my onc on Wed. before my tx.  Thanks.  Oh, and I'm glad you figured out the work issue.  I was also happy to see that you let the ins. co. know they were making things harder for you than they needed to be.  So many of us don't express that dissatisfaction and then the behavior continues.  Kudos to you for giving it to them straight. LJ13--you'll probably clog the Lady Remington!  I'm still sporting the decrepit old person look (you'll note it went from just old person to decrepit) because I don't have access to a shaver.  Had to figure out how to put on my first turban today as I CANNOT go out in public looking like this.  Even I would be embarrassed!  Good news is I have about 10 strands of hair hanging out the bottom of the turban, so it's looking more like a fashion statement, than a bald head covering.  Maybe I'll hang on to those 10 hairs and put them on a piece of tape so I can affix them to my head before I put on my head covering...  Hang in there with the tiredness--can we have Red Bulls to counteract that??? I'm trying to use my energy bursts to good ends today.  I cleaned the stove and sink and vacuumed upstairs.  I felt pooped after that (also went to the gym this a.m. and took my shower--some days that's enough to lay me out on the sofa for a while!).  I'm going to try to vacuum the living level today and see if I can swing by the curtain shop to get more fabric swatches (our fam rm/kitchen curtains are literally falling off the walls.  It was going to be my fall project to paint those rooms and get new curtains, but I got distracted.  Now I'm going to hire a painter!).  Tomorrow I'll do a laundry marathon and I really want to get a mani/pedi (can we do that?  I keep getting contradictory advice on that.  I don't do it often, but it really makes me happy and I deserve to be really happy before Wednesday.).  I'm also going to the gym again--one last hurrah! Everyone with tx this week--don't forget to start your anti-nausea meds on schedule!  I'd forgotten about them till today and dug them out from under the bathroom sink.  Also, start drinking water--you want that poison to pass out of you!  (Plus, for those of us doing this via IV, it helps to plump up the veins!) Ugh.  I sound like a mother.  Time for me to go! TTFN, D1",

Hey Jenn, I updated you at the top of the thread.  Glad you got another opinion and seem to be more comfortable with this tx plan.  Check with others, but with the year of Herceptin, you may want a port or a picc line, as suggested by Sherry.  You have time to do some research and talk to your docs.  Make yourself comfortable.  It's worth the time now so you don't constantly second guess yourself throughout your tx. I know where New Boston is, Sherry.  My dh's parents lived in Rochester for years and we'd make the drive from Kalamazoo to Rochester several times a quarter.  Took us down 94E to 75N--we went right past you!  I live in the \"other\" Washington, though.  Washington, DC (well, technically, I live just outside of DC in northern Virginia).  Wish I lived in Washington state--it's one of my favorite places to visit.  Enjoy your next week.  If it goes anything like mine, you'll feel pretty good, except for those moments when you suddenly realize that you're totally drained and have to sit for a minute! Speaking of Washington, how are your se's, Carol?  Thinking about you. My hairdresser is coming by this eve to shave me.  I look like Chucky in those horror films!  This has GOT to go!  Made it through most of my to do list (college girl used the stove today and messed it up.  I'm hoping she'll do the right thing and clean up after herself!).  Bad news is that my nail girl is off today, so I worked my own nails over and now just have to paint them.  I went out and bought a new polish so I have some reason to celebrate!  Also have to pack my chemo bag, which shouldn't take too long (famous last words!).

      "Content": "Jan 23, 2008 03:40PM Determined1 wrote: Good vibes and lots of hugs to LJ13, Sherry and JulieK, who are bellying up to the bar tomorrow.   May the bartender be kind. KathyL--periods.  Now there's a lovely subject for ya.  I was almost due for a period with tx 1, too.  It came with a vengeance about 5 days early and lasted a whole week.  And was extremely heavy.  At first I was told not to use tampons to avoid scraping or cutting myself, but then I figured, I'm already bleeding anyway, who'd know?  Plus, if this was my last period, I was not going down using pads!  It's a little too soon to be expecting another period, but I'm really hoping that one was it.  Of course, because I love to dwell on these personal, gross-out topics, if I do get another one--you all will be among the first to know! Spasm update.  Yep, I had some today.  I'm thinking I need a shrink.  I was talking to a friend of mine and we decided (with our vast medical knowledge) that this is how my stress over this situation is manifesting itself.  Normally, I don't notice the spasms, or can manage them, but since I've just had a tx, my body is worn down and I just can't make them go away.  My friend thinks I'm a candidate for better living through pharmaceuticals.  I don't like being out of it, but maybe she's right.  I'm planning to pop a muscle relaxant before bed, just in case.  It should help me sleep at any rate, something that has eluded me for the past two nights (one after even taking some Tylenol PM!). My friend and I did have some fun at the hospital today, though.  When we went through the front door, I told her I was going to ask about a wheelchair so I didn't have to walk the 10 miles to get my bloodwork done.  Lemme tell ya, the doo-rag works wonders!  The guy at the desk didn't even hesitate to loan us one.  Well, we were off!  She ran into the wall, doors, luckily no people...  There's a ramp on the way and she pushed me down it and let go!  We were laughing and squealing like two kids.  They'll never loan me a wheelchair again. So then I get into my bloodroom and our setup is there are two chairs on opposite sides of the wall, so you get to watch the other person having blood drawn while you are.  Not the best, but I was determined to make the most of it today.  My blood partner was an older, very fat, gentleman.  He was waiting for his labels to be printed for his tubes and I was holding a latex glove filled with hot water in an attempt to warm up my finger for my fingerstick (the romp down the ramp left me breathless and cold!).  My tech kept saying I needed to get warmer.  So I looked at the guy across from me and said, \"you wanna go on a trip?\"  Where, he wants to know.  I suggested the Bahamas.  He gets this huge smile on his face and counters, \"I prefer the South Pacific.\"  Okay, I tell him, we're on a huge deserted beach.  White sand.  Slightly oversized chaise lounges with big, overstuffed pads on them (without all the buttons sewn in that irritate your elbows).  Palm trees, natch, and a light breeze so they sing to us with their fronds.  What about the water?  I ask.  He wants deep blue.  No, I tell him, I'm all about emerald green.  Okay, he says.  How bout some needle nose fish just a few feet from shore, you know, the see-thru kind, just to look at for some entertainment?  Okay, he says, but not too big.  And I wanted real shallow water, the kind that laps at the shoreline.  Then I looked at him and the two techs and said, now I hope I don't offend anyone.  But I want a really hot, tan guy in short white shorts to come and serve me an alcoholic beverage in half a coconut shell.  And I want a straw and an umbrella in the shell.  And I want him to have a couple of towels over his shoulder cuz now I'm rolling over so he can give me a massage.  My eyes roll back in my head and I moan aloud.  They all bust their guts.  We both are done with blood and on our way.  Not bad for a chick afraid of needles!  Where shall I go next week?  Who's coming along??? Hmm.  I need to go compose myself. TTFN Jewelies! D1",

WVgirl--Gosh darn that DH!!!  Wish I could come and shake some sense into him.  And what's the bio freeze and what does it do? Jenn51--It sounds like you had one of the best b-days ever!!!  What a great surprise to have your son come home.  I'm glad it was a good day for you. JackieB--May your angels stay with you as you pass through your se period.  I hope they help keep the yuckies to a minimum.  Fingers are crossed for you. KathyL--I'm sorry you're having a sh*tty day.  But the t-shirt had to perk things up.  I'm going to lurk by my mailbox till the mailman arrives!!  (Thanks again, Carol.) Don't worry about being less than usual perky, SIS Kimberly.  I think anyone who knows us understands that this chemo takes it out of you.  Next concert, you'll be rockin' out! Sorry to be so brief today, ladies, particularly since I'm headed outta town tomorrow to see my college girl.  But I've got b-day decorations to get up, cakes to finish, presents to wrap, and I haven't even showered, yet!!  (Hope I have the energy for all of this!)

I feel like I fell outta the loop over the weekend, giving in to my body's need to just rest, so I'm really far behind.  Please know I've read everything (at least I think I have) and laughed, cried, nodded, and moaned with all of the posts.  But my chemo brain is just too puny to allow me to catch up comment-wise.  I have to give in and just pick up from here.  I know you all understand. Bday was totally fab.  I know not all of you are in to chocolate now (should I admit that I wasn't in to chocolate before chemo?), but I have to tell you about my cake, as it was no ordinary choc. confection.  First of all, it was a bundt cake.  From scratch (gotta love a dh who cooks).  It was chocolate, but also had orange in it, along with those teeny choco chips.  After the cake finished baking, the dh poked a skewer through it and poured a mixture of butter, triple sec and God knows what else over the top.  OMG!!!  So moist, so rich!  I really wish I could taste milk products, because it was screaming for some really good vanilla ice cream, but milk stuff is out right now.  Guess I have to stick with the cake.  Hmmm.  Maybe I'll go have a piece when I finish here.  :) Se's this tx are different for me (okay, still have blisters in mouth and dry, bloody nose, watery eyes, puffiness, etc., but those aren't too bad), but what I'm noticing that's new is some SERIOUS neuropathy in my hands and general spaciness.  I mean, you could cut my arms off about midway between my elbow and wrist and I probably wouldn't miss the rest of my arms.  My hands won't do anything I tell them to (typing is a total mess), and they feel funny.  Tingly, warm, I dunno.  Funny.  It kinda feels like it does to touch a bruise when I touch my fingernails.  Just all weird.  As for my head.  Oh brother.  I can't seem to focus without a great deal of effort (sometimes leaving me breathing heavily), and drift off from tasks midway through and really don't give one hoot.  Can't find words.  I think this is chemo brain for real.  This best be temporary, that's all I have to say!  Gotta tell ya, looking forward to tx #4 if this stuff is cumulative!!!  NOT! Anyway, Dana, loved the lyrics.  When I read them I felt I was reading your anthem.  You should keep them close at hand. Paula--love isn't just Feb. 14.  You need to set aside a day when you're both feeling better and celebrate in your own special way.  Don't let the folks at Hallmark decide for you!  Just focus on your healing and give each other flowers and chocolates another day. CarolC--OMG!  I had the itchies with my first tx!  Made me totally crazy!  I slathered on Sarna anti-itch cream, which would bring me relief for about 20 minutes at a time.  I was insane with it.  Luckily, after about 4 days the worst of it passed and I haven't had it quite so bad, since.  After tx2 I had trouble with the knuckles on my hands being red and itchy, but it wasn't nearly the experience I had the first go around.  I haven't had any of it yet, after #3.  Hopefully, it will pass quickly for you (if you don't go all loony in the meantime). Deb--Hey girl, just stay on lurker status till you feel up to chiming in.  We like to get a peep now and then to make sure you're okay, but we all know what it's like to be in se-land.  Just don't let them get you down. Wendy--Welcome!  Good luck with tx#2 tomorrow.  I'll put you in the header when I'm done with this post, so if you'd be so kind as to proof my work, I'd be grateful (particularly when I've already admitted that my brain isn't really of me right now). Boy, KathyL, you have had an ambitious day!  I sure hear you when you express concern over jinxing yourself, but you won't.  You got your nasty-lasta and you're going to be okay.  I was interested to read about your pounding heart.  I seem to have one, too, but I don't so much have the pounding in my head, which is I think what you have, but in my chest.  It's making me breathless.  Just really started with this tx (or at least I don't remember it before).  I'm hoping it's like all the others and will pass after a few days.  I guess we should be paying attention to it, though, huh? Kris--I was reading a book last night about one woman's chemo journey and saw a passage that really hit home with me.  It said that chemo patients today actually get what they call a chemo gut (yep, I have one), because we are now gaining weight on chemo thanks to all the anti-nausea meds they give us.  Personally, I'm up 10 lbs since my dx in August.  I'm not happy about it, but I'm trying to ignore it till this is over and then I'll deal with it.  But I don't think you're in the minority with a weight gain.  I do think you need to rest more, though.  Sounds like you're still trying to be \"normal.\"  Please give yourself a chance to recover from each tx.  I'm finding that I'm doing much better coping with the se's if I just lay low and don't expect too much from myself.  I KNOW it's hard--we're all go-getting women, but we MUST slow down for now.  (Remind me of this when I get wrapped again.) Speaking of slowing down, SIS Kimberly, are you hearing this?  I've been so amazed by your dance card of late, and I really hope your congestion isn't your body telling you that maybe you should only be slow dancing for now.  Food for thought.  Oh, and I'll share wine with you any day (when we can taste/enjoy it!)! CHJ--good idea to drink more fluids.  I'm totally into the school of thought that we need to flush this poison out.  Hang in there for the next few days, we're all pulling for ya. Congrats to Carol's pal on the baby!  She must be very excited. So in this book I was reading, the woman (and her son) described what sounded like depression when she finished her chemo tx.  Are we going to have that to deal with, too??????  What fun this is.  I think I need some cake.

Welcome to Deniseann!  (Thanks, KathyL, for the head's up.)  When I finish this post I'll add you to our header.  Please review it for accuracy--if you've been reading my posts lately, you know my brain is into fart-overdrive! Oh man, Sista2, throwing up?  So you get to have all the puffiness and bloating and sleep loss from the steroids, but they're NOT keeping your food down?  What's with that??  At least your hair wasn't falling in your face as you prayed to the porcelain god...  :) CarolC--you are something else, checking in during a midnight pee!  lol!  How's the neuropathy today? Well at least you're resting today, Kris.  I'll consider my nag a success.  ;)  I cannot believe you have a yeast infection!  Maybe the antibiotics for that will chase away the mouth sores/thrush, if you're prone to that!  (Looking for the silver lining.) An edible bouquet!  How cool is that, Paula!  A chocolate strawberry sounds divine to me about now... And Carol, goodies from the coworkers!  (Not sure what they were saying with the lace--didn't you tell us once that you work with all men??????)  Thinking of you today. May your sharts pass quickly, Deb. I had chicken last night, too, Julie.  What is it about chicken?  It, other than fried eggs, seems to be the only protein I want.  Odd. KathyL--if you have this ice storm, just stay indoors today.  Sounds like you need a rest.  Not surprising since you've been flying around since your last tx and making me feel totally slugly.  Just set out the crayons, construction paper and glue on the table for the little ones this afternoon and tell them to make the dh a special valentine.  Should keep them busy for 20 minutes or so.  And leave the mess.  ;) Oh, SIS Kimberly--just remembered that you asked what Clinique lotion I'm using.  It's their Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion.  I use it on my face, neck and pate.  And, knock on wood, this tx I don't seem to have the flakiness on my face that I've had both of the other times.  It seems to me there was something else I was trying to remember to tell you, but, hey, the thought is completely gone now... Guess I should try a shower.  Maybe the hot water will settle my back.  This is annoying... D1",

So I'm looking at our header and thinking to myself that Debbie started up her tx again today.  Shout out to Debbie! Also, hoping Carol and Wendy are doing okay. So tomorrow, I think we have Sherry, JulieK, AZDonna and Diana63 donning their capes.  You go, girls!  FUBC!!!!! I wore my \"save 2nd base\" tshirt and my \"check your boobies\" cap to bloodletting today.  The gals in the lab think I'm all about the sex!  They were giving me a hard time.  Wish it were true (been with my dh going on 31 years this April!  I need to shake this up, I think.  Maybe later.).  We laughed a lot. Oh, awkwardness experience today.  While at the grocery, I recognize the guy in front of me as a parent with whom I did loads of volunteer work when my girls were on the swim team.  I also run in to him periodically at the high school and we've chatted over the years.  So I looked him in the eye and said, Hey Dave, how's it goin?  He looked at me like I'd leapt from a different planet.  Absolutely no spark of recognition (last time I talked to him was, oh, maybe 6 months ago?).  Then I realized that I was a bald woman with a baseball cap on and he probably wasn't making the connection, or he was so freaked out that a bald woman was talking to him!  He muttered some benign niceity and scurried out of the store.  My gf and the checker and I guffawed at his awkwardness with the bald thing.  (Then the checker carded me for the wine I was buying for the dh!  He wished me happy birthday.  It's all good.) Hey LJ13, you okay? (See, you can tell I have chemo brain, look how spacey this post is...) D1",

SIS Kimberly and LJ13--I've had the watery eyes, too, but it comes and goes for me.  Seems to be one of the later se's to hit, usually shortly before I go in for the next tx.  I just gave up on my contacts while I do the chemo thing!  Also, LJ13's description of the nose thing is dead on for me, too.  Although I can tell the insides of my nostrils are dry if I don't swab A+D ointment in there a few times a day on a Q-tip.  I still have the bloody clots, but my schnoz is more comfortable.  As for sexy siren, SIS Kim--you got that down, girl!  The watery eyes won't take away a thing! Carol--for the first two tx I went off coffee the day before tx and stayed away till about a week later.  I was having awful headaches.  This time I didn't imbibe the day before or day of (didn't want to mess with my hydration schedule), but I've had an 8oz cup every day since.  Headaches were non-existent.  Allow yourself. Note to self:  stop preening when you sleep well.  Last night I don't think I slept a wink.  And then there's been all that talk of being PG around here, that I had a dream that I was PG.  Dream ended and I'm abruptly VERY alert when I deliver this monster baby!!!  I have GOT to stop reading the posts right before bed!

Managed to steal a few moments for myself at the computer and wanted to check in.  I know a lot of Jewels had tx this past week and I'm thinking about all of you as you manage your se's.  It's not fun, but I know you'll all be smiling again in a few days' time and I'm looking forward to it.  Hang in there! Jenn51--you had my head nodding in vigorous agreement with the whole contact lens thing.  I, too, have given up.  Although I'm having a devil of a time getting my prescription right in my specs--seems every time I get a tx, my vision gets worse so I head back to Lenscrafters to exchange my specs for stronger ones (I'm definitely getting my money's worth out of the \"try em for 30 days\" guarantee!  If they stop offering that, it's all my fault.).  My 3rd (!) pair should be ready for pickup on Tuesday, so hopefully I'll be able to see finally! I'm also having a hard time with my arm/lymph node surgery.  Everything was moving along just fine (I was doing my own version of stretching exercises), till about 2 weeks ago when I suddenly noticed that I had a big lump (about the size/shape of a date) near my incision and now my mobility has taken a wrong turn and I have new pains.  After calling my docs and talking to my back spasm physical therapist about it, I managed to get my surgeon to call in a script for a sleeve fitting and a consultation with a lymph edema specialist in the outpatient rehab at my hospital.  I have that first meeting on Tuesday.  I'll let you know how that goes. WVgirl--it warms my heart to hear that your DH...dh is softening.  I also found LJ13's comments to be rather insightful.  Keep an open mind, maybe it is just him finally accepting what's going on in your lives.  All in all, I was happy to read your post.  Hope your se's are okay... Deb--thanks for the input on the spasms.  My onc is not getting away with this-not to worry!  Sounds like you and your partner are good candidates for a lost weekend with bad rented movies and comfort food.  Hope you're both feeling better soon. Vettegal, another one of us with that bad reaction at tx2!  It's really scary, isn't it?  Particularly when you suddenly realize that your windpipe is closing up.  Sounds like they got you through it okay.  I'll bet your baggage on tx day increases as a result, just like mine did.  Hope you're doing okay today (probably running around from your steroids today...). Kris--sounds like you have all kinds of support!  Good for you.  How nice that your dh and son are going to shave so you can have that family \"look\" (you know, its probably a lot less dramatic to have t-shirts made up--you may want to consider it next time before all sporting the balditude!). LJ13--UTI and now congestion?  Please take care of yourself! Therese--I just read something earlier this week about depression after tx.  I'm hoping we won't be dealing with that.  I think we'll have to be honest with each other here and help one another watch out for it, because in all honesty, I'm not sure I'd recognize depression.  I think I'd find all kinds of ways to explain away my feelings.  I know it does happen, though.  We will have to be vigilant and open. Joan--it's good to hear from you.  Can't be easy to resettle your mom, I hope you're both doing okay.  And don't worry about the total balditude--it'll come. Carol--I hate to brag, but my last period was Jan. 1.  I had my cravings for ripples potato chips and french onion dip when the next one should have arrived, but I just gorged myself and felt guilty afterward, but no visit from Aunt Flo.  I still have hot flashes, but given what's left of my tx (Tamoxifen/Arimidex) I'm guessing I'll have to get used to that! New se cropped up 2 days ago that I'm finally acknowledging--my finger and toenails hurt!  You know that feeling when you press a bruise?  Well, my nails feel that way all the time--even when you're not touching them.  And my toenails find being in shoes quite painful.  I hope this isn't a sign of something else.... (losing hair is one thing, please, please don't make me lose my nails, too!!!!) Dh is starting to cook dinner.  We're having college girl's birthday celebration tonight (her 19th b-day is the 26th, but she won't be home, then).  My in-laws are coming over to share the meal.  I think I'll set the table with a valentine's day motif... Later. D1",

Anyhoo, Deb & Kris--As a neulasta se sufferer myself, I really wish the pain for you guys would just go away.  You both have tx this week and I want you to be strong and pain free when you head in to your centers.  So you tell those aches and pains to leave you alone--D1 says so!!! WVgirl--support comes from unexpected places, doesn't it?  Glad you got the compliment on your wig--it's so refreshing to have people say nice things!  Have a great celebration for your mom with your bro. My le arm took a turn for the worst yesterday.  I reached up to do something and felt it snap and now today I have pain from my pit to my elbow and the whole arm is numb.  I think I'm developing a problem here...  Pisses me off, too, because I was \"this close\" to full extension with that arm until 3 weeks ago when it suddenly became hurty.  Now it's downright painful.  Damn, damn, damn! Dh came upstairs to check on me today.  Said I'm being more quiet than usual.  I said, hum, I dunno.  He said, you're probably getting your game face on for Wednesday.  Maybe he's starting to get it...

Julie--Ugh, now you have spasms, too??  So sorry.  I know you said the heating pad didn't help much, but stay on it even when you don't have the spasms to keep them under control.  You also need to rest more and slow down (I know, hard to do when you're feeling well, but it's a must).  I find activity aggravates my spasms, so I try really hard to sit more than usual for the couple of days before they set in and again the day after, just to keep them from overwhelming me.  Hope they go away soon. Carol--so sorry about the lack of chemopause in your life.  I'll gloat--no period since Jan. 1 and I don't miss it--not one little bit!!! KathyL--You know, even when I see BC in the obits in the paper I have to force my eyes away because it bothers me--it must be awful to have bc claim someone with whom you have a connection.  I know it's hard, but try to look past it.  This woman obviously made great contributions to the bc community and her children will serve as a wonderful legacy and testimony to the type of woman and mother she was.  But what happened to her doesn't happen to all.  Stay positive, particularly as you face your se weekend and know that woman brought--and still brings--great comfort to others with bc.  You know she would want it that way.  And I'm with CathyCA, I hope your sunny outlook returns soon.  We're here for you. Thinking of Dana at the onc today... Hoping the chemotinis for CarolC, Wendy, LJ13, and our virgin, Kalen are going well.  Cheers!!! I'm off to hassle my surgeon for an earlier appointment than the 10th.  My onc thinks I need to get in asap so the surgeon knows what's going on with my arm, pending rads, scar tissue, etc.  I'm also scheduling rad consultations.  And my le therapist has me coming in 4 days next week to do compression wraps to see if we can get this le under control.  All I do is see docs!!!!  And here I'm done with chemo--does this never end??? Also, since I'm hyped on my steroids, I'm going to try to get over to DSW to see if any shoes float my boat.  I got a $10 off coupon for my birthday that expires tomorrow and I'd sure hate to let it go to waste as I LOVE shoes!  So, must shower and get my butt out the door. FUSE!! D1",

SIS Kimberly--oh yeah, she's baaack!  That was an amazing, thoughtful post--per your usual self.  Thanks, as always for the insights.  Glad you're back. Jenn51--not to worry, check in when you can.  We all appreciate what you have to say when you have time to say it without too much stress.  The last thing we need to do is stress each other out!  Shoot, we're all just doing the best we can.  We're here for you, not to worry. Same goes to you, Sista2.  We DO NOT kick a Jewel out!  I agree with KathyL, try ginger ale and ginger teas.  My taste buds are on their way out today and I'm trying to get as much water down as I can before they're completely shot, but I've got juices and ginger ale at the ready, so bring it on.  Oh, and yes, I wait 4 weeks for rads to start.  In the meantime, I'm supposed to meet with rad oncologists to pick one I like and get my simulation (whatever that is) done and tattoos before I start.  Don't worry, I'll share whatever I learn!  I am a little overwhelmed with all my med appointments next week (so far I have 8 scheduled M-Th, Friday I drive up to get college girl for her Spring Break), since it's my down week.  I hope I can keep up, but I've got to get moving if I'm going to be ready to rad-roll in 4 weeks... Sheshe--Thanks for the info on the nail infection remedy.  I'll keep it in mind.  Luckily, they only seem to be turning black right now--no sign of infection.  YAY.  Hey, you need to be firm with your new onc about your compazine allergy.  DO NOT take anything you know will make you sick.  There are lots of drugs out there.  I do decadron and anzumet and don't have any problems.  I do have compazine as a backup, but (knock on wood) haven't needed it.  Just be clear with your explanations and make the new onc listen.  You can do it. Carol--that yakky golfer girl, sheesh!  You know what, yak away, baby.  Sometimes it just works like that.  You asked about my arm.  No, I cannot lift it for long, yet.  But I'm working on it.  My le gal really worked me over yesty and made me sore today.  But I'm still doing my exercises and by God, that mobility will be back--after all, I AM DETERMINED1! Dana--I was wondering the same thing SIS Kimberly asked about, is the cancer on your liver something new, or bc mets?  Sounds like they're finally on your wavelength and you must be excited to start tx.  You've already gotten some great advice, so I'll just add my thoughts and prayers for you.  Keep your fighting spirit! g2g, gang.  Have to shower and be ready to leave for the nasty-lasta and then the ultrasound in a half hour.  Yikes!  Good thing my hair doesn't take too long... I'll try not to be too out of it when I slip into my fog, but it's rolling in tonight, so bear with me... D1",

And I can't believe that Carol and CHJ are up for round 3 tomorrow!  Have your capes and glasses at the ready!  Time to f*ck with some cancer!!!!! So Vettegal--that hat is awesome!  And you look so happy in the picture!  I never took any in my infusion center--not sure I would've liked the results.  You look simply mahvelous, dahling. Oh, Dana, when you get home--I agree with the info from KathyL re: the mouth sores.  I really stepped up the baking soda rinses this time and the only part that's been bad so far is my tongue.  (Can't wait for that to come back--haven't had a tongue/tastebuds for 6 weeks now.)  So be diligent with the baking soda rinses and I think you'll be better off than I was. KathyL--I'm having a racing heart this time, too (I think I had some trouble last time, but this is more pronounced).  Haven't called anyone about it, figuring everything passes in a couple of days, but maybe I'll mention it tomorrow when I go in to interview a rad onc, just to see how he reacts in real time. Okay, so I'm pissed.  I saw my surgeon yesty for my post-chemo/pre-rads checkup.  First of all, I waited 40 minutes to get in to the exam room (and I was 10 minutes early for my appt, so it was a total of 50 mins!).  Then, he rushed me.  Totally disregarded my concern for my le (said it would resolve on it's own in a few years as long as I got a sleeve for flying).  Was unconcerned about the cording, saying I should be using my arm to \"crawl\" the wall to work that out.  When I asked about my clumps of scar tissue, he said, rather than do anything (I was asking about massage to get rid of it--nothing SERIOUSLY medical), he'd wait 6-8 months and see if it resolved itself.  I told him that one of the clumps was in the rad zone and shouldn't I do something before rads cause I might not be able to after.  He said, naw, wait it out, see what happened in 6-8 months (we were getting into a vicious circle, so I dropped it).  He then said he wanted me to have a mammogram on my left side b4 rads, and I told him my last mammogram was clean and 2 weeks later I found a lump.  I wanted something more than a mammo.  He said mammos were good and I was the exception (I know from here that's just not true).  But here's the kicker--I asked him if he wanted to follow up on a suspicious spot they saw in my MRI in my lungs now.  He said (direct quote), \"What spot?\"  I told him to go look at my file and I'd get dressed and meet him at the front.  When he came out, he said, oh yeah, forgot about that, you need another CT scan, too.  Now, what kind of doc is that?????  If I hadn't been keeping track (and what am I missing?), he might have not reviewed my spot (which I choose to believe is nothing, because I'm SOOOO past all of this).  Upshot--I've been spitting nails (when I haven't been dozing off from exhaustion) since the appointment.  I've put out an APB to get the name of another surgeon who plays well with my onc and I'll be interviewing soon, I'm sure.  Whew.  I feel better.  (But I'm with you, Sheshe, it is hard to change horses midstream--I hope I do as well as you seem to have done.) On a happier note, my le specialist said that the wrap I wore yesty seemed to have made some of my swelling go down on my torso.  Today we're revisiting the torso and trying to get at my shoulder blade/arm pit.  Interestingly, she went to a conference this morning with a bunch of docs from our local hospital and my surgeon's partner was there and said in front of the group that meeting with le specialists to learn more about their services was a waste of time, since surgeons are doing more SNBs, which, in his opinion, would not lead to le.  My specialist was beside herself, because, she says removal of ANY lymph nodes puts a patient at risk and the last time she checked the sentinel node is a lymph node.  (We were ranting about this surgeon's office...)  Funny how small the world can be. Oh, Carol, I asked my specialist if it would be a good idea for you to just order a sleeve online since your ins is balking.  She said you could, but you should really call a lymphedema specialist and just chat over the phone to get some guidance.  She said she frequently takes calls and never sees the patient, just to help them get what they need.  I can't remember if you already have symtoms or not, but if you do, she thought a fitted sleeve would be better (I know, they're always selling something).  She has told me that I could order fashion sleeves (this sounds a little sick to me) on line, but they would not provide as much support/protection as a fitted sleeve, but if I were having some swelling and really needed a leopard print sleeve to make my outfit, online is the place for that.  She said you might be able to find an le specialist close to you by visiting the National Lymphedema Network website, www.lymphnet.org.  I haven't been there, yet, just got this today.  But you may want to check it out. SEs?  Right now the worst is my poor tongue.  It never fully recovered after tx 2 (I've been gutting it out) and now it just feels like it's been so badly burned that it will never be the same.  Even chocolate isn't getting through (although the dh keeps making choc mousse and choc pudding, thinking I can taste it and it will make my nails/hair grow--I just gag it down.  Don't have the heart to tell him.).  Of course, you'd think this would mean I'm losing that 12 pounds, but NOOOOO.  I know I have to eat, so I keep making deals for myself--you know, eat 7 grapes and you can stop.  Eat 6 bites of sweet potato, etc.  It all tastes like shit and hurts my tongue.  Drinking is much the same, although I'll discover that I can taste Gatorade and the dh will run out and buy a bunch.  Then I realize that I can't taste it anymore.  So I tell him I can taste Smart Water, so he buys a bunch.  You should see our garage--quantities of undrunk beverages stacked everywhere!  Even my beloved Vernors isn't cutting through this time.  Waaaahhhhhh! Well, well, well, that was certainly a bitch-fest, wasn't it?  You wouldn't know I'm feeling better, would you?????? Oh, feeling that heartburn feeling.  Gotta go take a Pepcid! I love this site!!!!!!! D1",

Oh Jenn, you had me lol with the Stacey and Clinton story!  They would have a field day with me, too.  Oh, and do try to do the exercises, they really help. Julie--so glad you got some sleep.  Sounds like just what you needed.  I know the numb finger routine well--it does pass after a few days (like all the se's), but its a pain while its around.  I never found anything to relieve it, so hang in there. Ah SIS Kimberly, I smiled the whole time I read the moor analogy--its a perfect fit!  I must admit, however, when you mentioned the Mounds jingle, the first one that popped in my head was the Almond Joy/Mounds one (sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't!).  Hope the infection responds to the abx soon. KathyL--you know, the sub onc might pay closer attention to you because he/she doesn't know your case as well.  This could be a good thing for you.  Just lay out your issues and tell them what you want.  How could they refuse you???  I've been thinking about you as you prepare for this last one--you can do it.  I have faith in you. Deb--I did not have trouble with my feet, so no help there, sorry.  Glad to hear the glove thing is helping out some--I know how insane you feel with itchy hands. So here are my new se's (betcha thought they'd stop once chemo was over, didn't cha?).  First of all, I seem to have developed bladder control problems.  Its just shown up in the last week.  I notice when I work out hard at the gym, particularly when doing sit-ups, I have trouble controlling myself.  50 seems too young for Depends, so I called my case nurse to report it.  Her take was to watch it for a while and see if it goes away and she wants me to take it up with my gyn.  Now, does everyone need to know I can't \"hold\" it???? Second new se is that last night one of my fingernails started bleeding from underneath the white part at the top of the finger.  This is the finger that looks the worst, with the black part extending to barely touching the white part at the top, so hopefully it will be the only one to bleed.  The part that has me all wrapped is that its a finger on my le arm and I'm all paranoid about infection on that arm, but I don't want to slather it with Neosporin and wrap it up as the moist environment might cause the nail to come off.  What to do?  This is all such a PITA. Oh good news!  When I called my case nurse she told me that I don't have to come in for my weekly bloodletting anymore!!  YIPPEE!  I've been doing it since mid-December, and sure won't miss it!  So I can check off that box.  So some good news to go with the icky news. Yikes, I have to leave to get my mom in an hour and still have much to do.  Later Gems! D1",

My ankle puffiness has come down a little, but they're still larger than life.  I'm hoping for a massive weight loss when the puffiness eventually goes away!! The bladder control seems to be a bit better now that I've gone back on the cranberry juice.  I'm going to keep an eye on it before I start whining about it to anyone else on my med team. Rad simulation.  Not difficult at all (except for getting the tattoo, when you have a needle issue, that's not fun).  They put me on a table with a thingy to hold my bad side arm over my head (that was not fun with the cording, but we got it there) and then my doc came in and taped a metal bb (but much smaller than the ones you're all imagining) to a spot on my chest.  They used the bb to be a landmark on the scan.  From that, they were able to map out how to position things to administer the rads.  The machine was the same kind they use for a CT scan (you know, the donut thingy that they pass you through).  I think the longest part was getting my body positioned on the table the way they wanted.  Other than the tattoo--absolutely no pain. I start rads on March 27.  They tell me the first two weeks will be pretty normal, but after that I'll be really tired and will start getting my burns.  They gave me some lotion to put on my radiated areas (I want to say its Alra cream, but its upstairs now and I'm too lazy to go up and check it out).  It looks like it has good stuff in it--aloe vera, collagen, vitamin e, and lanolin as I recall--so I'm thinking I'm going to start using it this week before I start to get the skin all lubed up.  The first session will take a while, they tell me, but after that I'll be in and out.  I'll keep you posted. CT scan went okay, except that I had the worst IV putter inner EVER!  He dug around for what seemed like hours looking for the vein.  I was screaming \"f*ck me!\" the whole time and asked him to take it out and start over, but he wouldn't.  I was completely stressed after that.  My mom felt so badly for me that we went immediately to the liquor store where she bought us some Knob Creek bourbon and we came home and drank away my bad experience (how mature of us). Other than my visits to my legu, that's all the medical stuff I did with my mom, the rest of the time was going to the gym and playing.  We even took college girl's easter basket up with us when we visited her and I got her roommate to help me surprise her with it this morning.  She was really surprised!  It was our first Easter without her.  Now we're getting ready to head to the in-laws for Easter dinner. As Vettegal would say, It's all good!!! Happy Easter, everyone! D1",

Hey Dana, what made you think the hair \"down there\" would be exempt?  The only hair on me that was exempt was my arm hair--go figure.  I used OTC pain relievers for the bone pain.  It didn't make it go away, but it made it sorta bearable.  Hope you're able to cope okay.

Thinking of CHJ and Sheshe in the lounge.  Hope its \"happy hour!\" Paula--You know, its funny, I just assumed the shin thing meant that I was out of shape, too.  I don't always use our treadmill since I have a sciatic nerve issue and the tm aggravates it, so I trek on over to my community center to use the ellipticals and recumbent bikes, so I just figured the tm was using a different muscle group than my usual workout.  Now that several of us are having the problem, I'm rethinking that its related to whatever poison was pumped in to me.  You know, I think I can blame all kinds of things on chemo! Hey Sheshe, I'm with Paula, don't lose too much weight too fast.  Although I'll say it sounds like the weight loss thing is out of your control--not like regular dieting.  Just take care of yourself.  Hope your se's are mild this go around. LWDana--Another beautiful baldie!!  I'm so glad you found something to help with your bone pain.  Hang in there. Carol--OMG, girlfriend, you SOOOO needed this break.  I'm really, really happy for you. Diana--What a little cutie Derrick is!! Sista2--Bummer that you're not sleeping.  Having poor sleep issues, myself, I know what a drag that is.  I swear by a glass (or two) of wine!

Oh Therese, I'm so glad you seem to be turning the corner!!  Keep it up and keep smiling.  :) CathyCA and Sista2--Earlier today I was going to say that I haven't had many people ask me much, but then today I went into the District to buy the dh an appreciation gift and went to a specialty shop.  There weren't many customers in the shop, so both of the clerks were talking to me.  They weren't survivors themselves, but one of them knew many people who were.  She had lots of questions and was intrigued by my blackening nails (that was a new one for her).  She also wanted to know if my hair was coming in red (apparently she'd heard that was what was going to happen!).  As I was talking to them (reminding them to do SBE's, of course) I tried to assess my feelings.  Part of me was annoyed that the one woman felt like she could probe so intimately, but the other part was happy to share the experience.  Perhaps I haven't had as many \"interested parties\" as you guys, so I'm still okay with it.  (I did get a kick out of the more probing of the two--at first she said she didn't think I was a cancer survivor because I still have some eyebrows!  I think we still have a lot of educating to do!) Babydoc called today and said his surgeon pals thought my cyst could be drained--not requiring surgery to get rid of it.  Bad news is that none of his pals were willing to drain me.  So I have to go back to my surgeon's practice.  I called them today and asked if one of his partners would be available to drain me (she's drained me before and was far more caring than my guy).  Luckily, my surgeon is out of town till Monday and so I'm pushing to get an appointment with his partner before the weekend.  Keep fingers crossed that I can pull this off. Okay, I'll give someone else a turn here.  Hope everyone is having a good day. D1",

I get a call from my surgeon's partner.  She wanted to discuss draining my cyst.  I laid it out for her and since my surgeon is out of town till Monday (someone is watching over me!) she's going to do it tomorrow.  I'm nervous about having it done (she even mused out loud that the fluid might be thick, requiring a bigger needle--made the needle-phobe in me downright shake in my boots), but I want to get it over with.  She was even okay with having my babydoc ring her this afternoon to discuss my situation.  Who knows, maybe I'll get back on track after all.  (I'm not counting on anything till I get there, for some reason my journey with bc has been filled with delays--Example:  I was dx'd in August and am traveling with you guys who were dx'd several months later.) So today, (instead of starting rads as originally planned), I'm going to try to run out to the garden center and get whatever I'm supposed to dump on my grass in March.  I missed my annual overseeding in January because I was otherwise occupied, so I'm just going to skip that step and move on.  But I like to keep the grass nice (a high school job was mowing lawns for a lawn care company, so I guess some of that rubbed off on me).  My dd is interested in working at the garden center because many of the employees are Latino and she wants to use her conversational Spanish (I think she just wants to learn some slang and cuss words), so I'm also going to see if I can pick up an application for her.  Also plan on hitting the gym even though my achilles tendons are really sore and my ankles are so swollen you can't find my ankle bones...  Maybe I'll just veg out on the recumbent bikes and do an \"old lady\" workout today.  Better than nothing. SIS Kimberly--I was just asking my legu about the length of time I'll be wearing my torture bra yesterday!  She's hoping that by the end of summer I won't need it every day and can just pull it out when I feel the fluid (I can actually feel the fluid, so I know what she means).  She did recommend compression socks that I can get at a local pharmacy that specializes in weird health devices for my ankles.  And my pants right now are compression jeans because I'm carrying around an extra 13 pounds, so I'm one big stuffed sausage these days!  No one told me that this was an se of cancer tx!!  And when will it go away??????  (Can I have some cheese with that whine?  --Or maybe not, too many calories!!) Bottoms up to LJ13 and Julie!  I'll be thinking about you! Best to everyone. D1",

The BRCA test checks genetic possibilities of cancer.  I don't have a history of breast cancer (other cancers, yes) in my family, so I have not had that test and can't help much more.  I'll bet there's a conversation for that on this site, tho... And I know there's a conversation about triple neg.  From what I hear, once you gals get through your treatment and past the first 5 years without recurrence/new cancer, you're in better shape than the rest of us.  I'd check the conversation for more info.

My onc center (what do you call those places?) looks nice.  Usual chairs, but curtains around each one, if you want privacy, and personal TVs.  Windows by every chair.  There's an \"arts\" person who coordinates beading, knitting, dance therapy, massage, origami, whatever patients request.  Apparently, infusion takes 4 hours every time as they don't mix our cocktails ahead of time--they do it after we arrive, weigh in, and get vitals.  It seems sometimes things change, depending on our bodies and they personalize (marketing, I know, but as a marketing person, I bought into it).  Other suggestions, such as getting the wig ahead of time, buying laxatives and stool softeners and soft foods ahead of time have all been mentioned here (thank God for those who have come before and fill us in).  They're also trying to accommodate my fear of needles by ordering my blood tests be done by finger stick whenever possible. Hmm.  Need to sleep on the rest of it.  So much information to digest.  I'll be back later when I can share more. KathyL--Yeah, I'd get the port if I were doing the herceptin, too.  I have a prescription for decadron, too.  I need to look at the others to let you all know what they've given me.  I'm too tired and brain dead from all I heard tonight to deal with it now. Weird--I'm almost excited to get going.  Not sure what that means... D1",

I got my hair colored today.  I know, waste of money.  But I want to go down with a smile on my face.  My stylist is great.  She didn't cut it today.  I have an appointment on Dec. 30 (I hope I feel well enough) to go in and have it cut to a short bob.  Sort of my in-between hair.  Then she has agreed to come to my house to shave me on Jan. 8 or 9, depending on our schedules.  She told me to get my wig before the 30th and give it to her so she can style it for me.  She also suggested that I get a wig a bit longer so I can continue to go in and get my hair cut while I'm bald and we'll just keep changing the styles on the wig.  Sounded like a way to feel normal to me.  (Holy sh*t, this is sounding so real all of a sudden!!!).

Today was buttkicker day.  Luckily, I took tylenol pm before bed last night (note to all of you--get some sort of sleep aid for this--you will need it).  Thank goodness I took some.  I slept, but fitfully.  Kept waking up with the realization that I hurt so badly ALL OVER.  But then I'd try to get comfy and drift off again.  Sleep was a safe place to be.  When I woke up my upper back, lymph arm and stomach innards were KILLING me.  I have a theory on this.  My thinking is anywhere we've had injury in the past (ie. lymph surgeries, I fractured a few vertebrae as a kid, etc) will really feel the brunt of the neulasta.  Not sure what's hurting in my stomach--I keep thinking it's my ovaries, but my dh just rolls his eyes.  Anyway, have been popping max strength tylenol as I can and have cut back on the activities of the day.  In fact, I only got my haircut (a Katie Holmes thing--family wonders why I didn't do it sooner) and then managed to smile through lunch afterward.  I feel like I'm 108 years old, hobbling around (and a little unsteady today).  Is this really going to make me better? So here's my take.  This is the biggest head game I've ever played in my life.  It's not that I can't do any of it--it's just that every day is a new emotion or pain and we all have to rise to each challenge.  We are going to be the biggest, strongest, bravest, cancer-free bitches on the face of the planet.  Let's do it!!!! Now I'm going to try to head over to my in-laws to watch the Vikes play (they have that game day ticket subscription thingy).  If I can't deal, then we're coming home. Still eating--smaller meals though.  No real nausea problems.  I did have 4 eyelashes fall out when I washed my face last night and again this morning, which prompted more eyerolling from the dh when I announced \"it's started!!\"  (Even I know it's too soon, but I'm all for the drama when I can muster any.) I'm hoping the tylenol pm will work again tonight.  I think this neulasta pain is only supposed to last a couple of days, right?  I hope so.  Gotta have my strength for whatever's next. Anyway, good thing I waited a while to post.  This morning would've been filled with \"f\" bombs (my word of choice when I just can't find the right way to express myself).  I do, however, have a suitable signoff today: FUBC (I know SIS Kimberly will get it!  ;) ) Thanks for being there--I'm addicted to us, too!

My head is spinning!!!  Been driving out to the hinterlands (almost WV!!!) looking at tile samples.  The farther west I drive, the more reasonable the pricing (but am I saving anything with all that driving-gas consumption???).  Got through Senior Night-huge success.  We only have the boys' basketball senior night to go on Monday, but I think I've done all I can do for that one.  The girls' bball players were so cute-3 of them never start, so they were stoked.  They were all so excited they couldn't play their way out of a paper sack.  It was nice to see them so happy. So, Carol, how'd the BGP thong work for ya?  I thought about you yesterday.  I hope it went well.  Will the Zometa help with the achiness? Julie, can you please post better news about the hot flashes?  Geez.  I hate to think of two years of this! Hey, will they let someone who has been radiated work with radioactive material?  Just a thought, Carol.  Don't want you vaporizing, or anything. Is There Anybody Out There?  Oh yeah!  The intro to that one (where it sounds kinda scary) gave my kids the creeps when they were young.  Nice call, Deb. This music talk is so funny!  Dh took me to the Roger Waters concert 2 years ago, I guess.  I was such a pig in shit that night (not sure if there's a jab at the pink pig in there, or not).  I can't remember the last time I danced and sang that much.  He did all the good stuff and a couple of new things that mostly poked fun at Geo Bush.  That Roger Waters is such a lefty-he may be a communist!!! OMG, Paula, the baby commercials are hysterical!  (I think they're for E*Trade.)  You must see them.  Oh, and there's the post confirming that you did!  Forgot about the Bridgestone commercial-I really laughed at that one, too. I liked the 3D with the dancing athletes, too, LJ.  Although you'd have to beat to the brink to get me to remember what they were advertising... Good job on the MRI, KathyL!  And stay away from ds-you don't need to be sick again! What did the le person say, Patty?  I dropped in to say hi to my legu after my MLD massage today and she was so excited to see me.  She'd gotten a new machine that can detect lymphedema before the symptoms really present.  This is a good thing as caught early, le is totally manageable.  There are 4 stages in le (sound familiar?) and I was in the 2nd stage when I went in last Feb (has it been a year?).  Well, today, she hooked me up to her machine and measured my swelling (this was right after I'd had my lymph drainage massage, so I was in a good way), and the machine registered a \"0!\"  No swelling!  This is good, but it means that the MLD I do with a human and in my machine are working, as is the wearing of all that compression shit.  It did encourage me to keep wearing it, however... That would be great to be deported, Deb.  I hope your films come out okay.  And hey, a little recon could go a long way to make your head happy about your body.  I'm all for it.  (I'm still pondering some work on my good boob to make it the same size as Frankenboob, but it's hard for me to justify, since most of the time my girls are in the big bra, which causes uniboob syndrome.) KathyL-you are not a tech retard.  I'm still groping around on fb, too.  I even tried to get in from my blackberry today, but couldn't figure the damn thing out.  Guess I'll wait till LV and have Carol show me how to use it! How do you get your dh to help with MLD, Tina????  Mine can't be bothered.  Ergo, the machine. Maz?  How'd it go? So, you guys, I have to echo what I'm reading here.  I seem to be heading to fb first, and the thread second (if at all) these days.  But I don't want to lose anyone.  I'll keep popping in here, but it may not be as often as I'd like.  Just sayin'.

You know, maybe you have some dead skin in your pit that is causing the odor.  (I'm not trying to be gross, sorry.)  Try squirting some anti-bacterial soap on a washcloth or one of those fluffy shower ball thingys (something that will gently exfoliate) and rub in your pithole to dislodge dead skin.  Be so very, very careful around your incision, though.  See if that helps. Glad you're going home early, you should not push too hard.  Besides, we have to have clear heads to send good vibes to SIS Kimberly and Deb. D1",

First of all, thank you, all of you, for your kind words of support.  I'm much better today.  I think venting and adjusting to some potentially yucky news helped considerably.  I've decided to try to push the thought from my mind until my doctor's appointment next week, this is my week to feel good and I don't want those bad thoughts spoiling it.  So there. KathyL--Would you be so kind as to double-check my work against your JJ list?  I would feel just awful if I left someone out, or had their info incorrect.  Also want you to know I'm thinking about your dad today.  Please let us know how his surgery goes. Carol, CarolC and Vettegal--would the three of you get rid of those colds?  You make my nose run in sympathy! Jenn51--Are you thinking what I'm thinking about the \"FU?\"!!!  Yep, FUBC means exactly what you think it does.  ;)  It's become something of a rallying cry on this thread! SIS Kimberly--Yes, I did have an MRI.  (One reason I'm being more peaceful today was after reading your reminder that I DID have every test in the book!)  They found all kinds of stuff that I'm sure is nothing--and even removed lumpy stuff that showed up just to discover it was only lumpy stuff--not cancer.  It's just scary as sh*t to have some doc feel your lump and say, \"hmm, I don't like that.  If it were scar tissue it should feel different.  You need to see your surgeon again and have him check it out.\"  Just messes with your brain when you're already on the brink, if you know what I mean.  But let's move on till next week.  I'm sure the lump will still be there. Deb and SIS Kimberly--you both are talking about slight nausea issues.  Please remember to eat smaller meals and more often.  It really does help.  As does constantly sipping on a beverage.  When water started tasting like metal to me, I switched to ginger ale.  You really need to stay hydrated.  I kinda smiled when I read about the spicy food aversion.  My dh made something one night that we eat all the time that is not spicy.  Well, I thought he'd dumped Tabasco sauce all over it!  My kids (who don't like spicy at all) were laughing at me saying it tasted like it always did.  Point is, I think our buds are sensitive.  I'm back to eating normal stuff, so the sensitivity is temporary.  Also, if you're having trouble with heartburn, take a Pepcid AC an hour before dinner--it works wonders! WVgirl--I had real issues with blisters in my mouth.  I use the Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash (found at Target).  Brush and rinse 2x daily and rinse a third time midday.  For a few days I wasn't sure it was helping, but now the blisters are pretty much gone (the mouth is preparing for round 2!).  I think we're supposed to use stuff that doesn't contain alcohol for the duration of our tx to control the mouthsores.  I read that if they're really bugging you, ice chips and popsicles will numb the discomfort for short periods, at least.  Let us know how you're doing. So, I have big news!  My hair started falling out this morning!!!  I'm excited and apprehensive at the same time.  Noticed it first in the shower.  I use a shower ball thingy with those washes from Bath and Body, so I'm scrubbing away and after I wash my ummentionable area I notice the darn thing is COVERED in pubic hair (forgive me the grossout factor).  I had to throw my thingy out!  (Not sure how I'm going to proceed from here, as I can't afford to go on a \"disposable thingy\" plan right now.)  Then when I styled my \"Katie Holmes\" 'do, there were massive amounts of hair on the floor.  When I dried off and assessed the damage, I've concluded that you can't tell I've experienced a large hairloss, but I'm guessing it will start to look fairly thin in a couple of days at this rate.  Good news, this is one se that comes with no pain/discomfort--at least not yet. One new se that has huge discomfort is that my hands have started to itch like mad.  I feel totally insane trying to alleviate the itch.  My college girl says it means I'm going to come into money.  I hope so--I'll make Bill Gates look like a pauper!  My mom sent me some anti-itch lotion (I'll have to get the name of it later) that helps some.  I'm hoping this only lasts a couple of days... Look good, feel better was this morning.  Makeup is amazing!  But the best part was seeing how to tie the scarves and to learn how to make different looks with some scraps of fabric.  I also picked up my wig prescription while at the hospital for the class, so now I can go wig shopping (just in time!). Long post.  Sorry.  Yesterday was a blur, so I had some catching up to do.  I printed the info on the shirts, Carol, so I'll get mine to you as soon as I get a chance.  Thanks for your work on this.  If you need to hand off since you start your tx tomorrow, give a holler. Later. D1",

KathyL, Maz, CarolC--Okay, it's weird to start taking the meds today, isn't it?  Seems like you've been working on getting your head ready for weeks, but taking that first steroid makes it real, doesn't it?  It's okay to feel apprehensive and scared.  You don't know what to expect, for crying out loud!  Keep telling yourself that others have done this and laugh afterward and so will you.  Just take a deep breath in the morning and put one foot in front of the other.  You've all done more difficult things in your lives, of this I am sure, and you will be okay tomorrow.  Be sure to pack lots of diversions in your bag--reading material, iPod, crossword puzzles, knitting, whatever.  You may even want to pack yourself a snack and a drink, just in case your center doesn't provide those things.  Dress comfortably (what to wear was a big deal to me, for some reason).  I wore jeans, t-shirt and sweatshirt over the top.  Since I get mine via IV, I could wear crewneck stuff.  But if you have a port, maybe a zip sweatshirt would be a better choice (some ladies find infusion rooms on the chilly side--hence the sweatshirt suggestion).  And take your lovey (if you've had kids, you know what this is!) if it makes you feel better.  Oh, and be sure that your escort brings stuff to amuse him/herself.  My sister always had her escort massage her feet for a good part of her infusions, so she packed foot cream.  My dh would sooner jump from a bridge than massage my feet!  (But it does sound nice, doesn't it?)  We'll all be with you in spirit! I, too, am off to imbibe at the chemotini bar tomorrow.  Even though I kinda know what's coming, I'll have to admit that taking my steroids was tough.  I went to the gym this a.m. and found myself unusually light-headed after my aerobic workout.  Had to sit for about 20 minutes before lifting.  Not sure if I can blame that on the steroids, or just the stress of infusion.  But I finally finished (took me just under 2 hours to do my workout, which usually takes about 1 hr. 15 mins.).  Now I'm doing laundry and have to get to my bills (I think I go in to nesting mentality).  Then if I have time, I REALLY want a pedi/mani (since the dh won't rub my feet, I'll pay someone to do it!).  Guess I should get started on this stuff--time's a wastin'! Bottoms up!!! D1",

I want to shout out to Jenn51, who started with tx#1 today.  Hope it went well for you, please let us know. Also I think yuyubear, DianeB, and AZDonna had their 2nd tx's today.  DianeB, I know you had a hard time with your first one, so I hope today was much better.  Please let us know.  And do any of you have hair??  (Post pix, c'mon, I did.) What about LJ13--how's the hair loss?  Is your experience vastly different being on a 2 week schedule?  Hope you're well. Good luck to Paula, starting tomorrow.  Hope you're able to sleep tonight.  Don't worry, infusion day isn't so bad--it's just the head part that gets to you.  I trust you'll be as pleasantly surprised as the rest of us at how smoothly it really does go. And good luck to Therese, with the 2nd tx tomorrow.  We'll be thinking about you! There are so many of us!  I can't believe it!  This must've been the new year's resolution of 2008!  Good thing we're all up to the challenge. Vettegal--you ARE NOT a Hank Moody fan!!  We LOVE that show in our house!  Never picked up on the quote.  Can't wait for it to start up again.  We were huge Weeds fans, but the plot went astray, so we were happy to have Californication come on the scene.  Speaking of weeds, has anyone heard anything about medicinal marijuana for cancer?  My family keeps asking me (I think they're more interested in sacrificing themselves for my betterment, but oh well--happens when you have teenagers, I guess.  Better to get it from me than some street vendor.)  I feel kinda awkward about asking about it, particularly since my onc already thinks I'm a little wacko with the back spasms (he should have some--then he'd feel differently).  Anyway, thought I'd pass it by the group.  Sorry, Vettegal, to tack it on your shout out, please don't take offense. Sista--you okay with your delay?  Sucks.  I'm the queen of wait (guess I should've seen the waits in the doc's offices coming--you guys don't even know the HALF of my waiting game.  Just remember, I was dx'd in mid-August, and I'm just now getting chemo!).  Just know I really do feel your pain. Carol--you be studly with the shirt order.  You doing okay with se's?  You NEVER complain and what are we here for, anyway?? Okay, getting tired.  Guess I should call it a night.  Particularly since I have to drag my sorry butt outta bed for an 8:45 appointment tomorrow and I'm finding morning to be a bit of a pain these days... Later, Jewels. D1",

AZDonna--How's the tooth today?  I hope you can get that all squared away before your next tx.  What a bummer to have to deal with that now (or EVER, in my book, but that's fodder for another support site). KathyL--I agree, your little one sounds totally precious.  Like LJ13, I found the chemo knocking the hair off your head to be particularly sweet.  I think I'll use that explanation for my own family (even when we grow up, sometimes it's hard to understand...).  And, yes, I think Spring is going to be a bit more poignant for all of us this year.  Hope you're doing okay today. Glad to hear you're feeling well, Deb!  It IS hard to believe that you'll have good days on chemo, particularly when you're passing through those bad days, but they're there.  Please take advantage of them.  We'll be here--although it'll take a while to catch up as we're pretty chatty! PALady--I want to address the steroid timing thing.  It sounds like you're doing something similar as me.  I take Decadron 2x daily the day before, day of and day after tx.  Then I take Anzumet the day after tx and the day after that.  All other steriods are administered via IV when I get my tx (it's just more decadron and anzumet).  My doc told me to take the two doses of decadron early in the day--ie. one when I wake up and the second one no later than 3p--so it doesn't keep me awake at night.  On the Anzumet days, I take it in the morning.  I don't know if I'm having any additional sleep problems from the steroids (I was already a poor sleeper), but my pattern has been about the same before and after.  If you suspect the second steroid dose that you're taking with dinner is keeping you awake, try taking it mid-afternoon.  From what my doc told me, the few hours of timing is not affecting the effectiveness of the steroid, but the steroid can most certainly affect your sleep pattern.  So try it earlier, it might help. Now, I wanna know, how can that beautiful woman in Vettegal's picture still have odor issues?  She's WAY too pretty to deal with that!!  Hope the new b.o. juice does the trick. Hope everyone else from last week is starting to get their feet (literally) under themselves. Good luck today, CathyCA.  You have our thoughts. And everyone else scheduled for this week--get your laundry and vacuuming done!  ;) Later. D1",

Okay, Jean--welcome!!  You're just squeaking in to the January group--lucky for you!  We're not only beating cancer here, but we're laughing along the way.  Let us know anytime you want to share.  We can handle the good, bad and ugly. Jenny--I'm going to join the hydration chorus.  I drink an extra 2 gals. of water during the day before tx (I just fill up my jug and carry it around all day long).  And then I drink another gal in the morning before infusion starts.  But don't stop there.  Take a water bottle to drink during infusion and keep drinking afterward.  When water tastes funny, I switch to ginger ale and ginger tea and flavored waters (I don't like those as much).  The other thing I'm doing that's preventative is taking a colace in the evening before bed.  I do this from the day of tx for about 4 days and it gets me over the hump.  Also start taking a pepcid AC every evening--you'll need this for about 10 days (stop taking it when you can eat regular meals again is my rule of thumb).  And allow yourself to rest when you need it.  You're gonna be GREAT!!! Dana--come by for a meltdown anytime.  I'm sorry I wasn't online when you were down, but you know we're here to help prop you back up.  No one is super duper positive 24/7 without cancer.  We're entitled.  Glad to hear you're feeling better, but please, dump any time you need to. Vettegal--Yep, I agree with whomever said \"VETTEGUY!\"  You know, I'm 3+ months out from my AND surgery and some days I still have trouble.  Yesty, in fact.  Sometimes it still feels like there's something in my pit and other times it's a pulling pain running down my arm.  I'm trying to keep stretching it out and I'm slowly increasing the weightbearing exercise I ask it to do and I'm thinking that's all I can do to get it back to its old self.  I'm also still waiting for the numbness to go away.  I think this is a long term project.  The chemo takes one's mind off it a little, so maybe that's a good thing. CathyCA--dang.  I did 2 miles in a half hour today and was puffing my chest all out.  You inspire me to do better next time. KathyL--That's funny that you had a down day on Day 8 after your first tx--so did I!  Day 8 this time is better, so keep the faith for tx2.  Just snuggle in and allow it to pass.  Tomorrow will be better. And WVgirl--you TOTALLY ROCK the balditude!!!  (Nice head, BTW.)  You won't believe how quickly you're able to get around in the morning now.  It's going to be hard to get back into the swing of hair washing, shaving and hair styling down the road! Saw my p/t again today.  It was a new one, and I'll have her for the rest of my tx.  She's been sent from heaven.  She's about 10 years older than I and has the gentlest manner.  Those young therapists make me feel competitive (I know, another reason I should be in therapy) and I can't relax.  This woman was no threat to me, so I actually listened to her.  She discovered that my pelvis is not properly lined up and we did some pushing and pulling to get that straight.  Hopefully, that will help with the spasms AND help with a dud sciatic nerve that's been bugging me for 10+ years.  She then gave my butt a massage (weird at first, but by the end I was drooling) to relax it.  I have some take home exercises and I'm going to try to be a good girl and actually do them.  I hope we're on to something...  Now I gotta call my surgeon for my biopsy results.  I don't know why, but I'm putting it off. Finally, good luck to WVgirl, PALady, Deb and Billsgirl, who are donning their SHERO supercapes tomorrow for another chemotini, and a special January Jewel toast to Vettegal and Jenny, who are getting their first taste of the cocktail.  Bottom's up!  FUBC!!!!!

You know, I had a somewhat similar experience back in August when I was trying to decide between lump+rads and mast+recon.  When I saw the plastic surgeon, I told him that I wouldn't be able to deal with anything artificial in my bod, so no recon using implants for me (it's my head thing that makes me afraid of needles...), so he suggested using fat from my belly.  Well, I got all excited as I think my belly is about my worst body part (can't see my butt, so I never consider it).  I exposed my \"mom pouch\" to the ps and his nurse and he sharply drew in his breath and said, \"No, no I cannot touch that.  It is perfect!\"  First, (and probably last) time anyone will ever be complimentary about my gut.  :) D1",

Kris--I SO feel your pain with the Pepsi.  I am a coffee drinker in the morning and can't stand the taste of it for about a week after tx.  The problem with that is, I get the most horrendous headaches from not getting my caffeine fix.  I'm trying the tea thing, but it's not quite up to par with my usual intake.  I've been eyeballing my daughter's Red Bull stash in the fridge for caffeine, but that stuff tastes awful to me (maybe when my tastebuds are off, it would taste fab!  You never know.).  Maybe I'll give it a try this time to stave off the headaches that the max str. tylenols can't seem to touch.  Oh, and glad your pooper's working again. SIS Kimberly/Vettegal--you two usually post fairly often and we're not hearing much from you.  Hope you're both okay. Hang in there, Dana.  Sounds like you're getting hit on many fronts right now.  It's not fair, but you seem like a fighter.  Don't give up. Damn, Carol.  Was hoping you'd skip the hair thing, too!  Maybe it'll just thin some.  If it does come out, I can tell you're going to be Baldilicious from your avatar, so keep the faith (and some Drano!). Oh, doggoneit.  I can't remember all the shout outs I wanted to do today.  Must be chemo-brain.  Anyway, gotta get a few things done in the next 40 minutes or so before we head out, so I should get on it.

Ah KathyL, your reaction sounds familiar.  So sorry you had that happen.  It creates a little drama, doesn't it?  Good news/bad news is that next time they'll probably give you the benedryl before the Taxotere.  I'm surprised they didn't give you the Ativan, too.  They did to me today and I made a little stink about not wanting it, but the nurse explained that it would relax my windpipe and help to keep it from seizing up.  Foolishly, I believed her.  Now I'm wiped out...  Anyway, I believe they learn a little more about us every time and make adjustments, so your next tx should be more uneventful (mine today sure was).  Let's not see you in the hospital this time, tho! To whomever it was that recommended the Claritan 24 for the neulasta (sorry, too lazy to look back, please forgive me), I asked my onc about it today.  He said that since I'm suffering from such a dry nose that it bleeds, he thinks something like claritan would aggravate the dryness and make me more uncomfortable.  We're going to try a little more decadron for a few extra days and keep cutting down the dose to wean me off of it and see if by eliminating the steroid crash, I'll be better able to handle the bone pain.  Worth a try, I figure.  And I love the high from the steroids--I just wish they didn't make me eat so much... Hmm.  I'm finding typing to be very frustrating tonight.  I'm making WAY more mistakes than normal (chemo brain).  I think I'll sign off.  I have a busy day planned tomorrow--hopefully I'll be able to stop in or I'll get behind!

So, SIS Kimberly, when I read your post a light bulb went off (okay, I can be a little slow sometimes, but now I can blame it on chemo brain!).  You're absolutely right about my surgeon.  He's very attentive when he gets to do something, but doesn't have the time of day for me when it's non-surgical.  I can point directly to the scar tissue in my breast, which in January caused him all sorts of concern (you may remember he even needle biopsied it), but this time, he's saying, oh just wait 6-8 months and see if it goes away!  The writing is on the wall.  I'm a little frustrated that my APB hasn't yielded any names, yet, but maybe I need to be patient--not everyone in my network here is as obsessed with medical care as I am right now. Oh Vettegal, it warms my cockles (not sure what a cockle is, but the word is tickling me today), to read about the generosity of your customers.  And this comes at a good time for you.  Try to shrug your boss off as the DH that he is and know that you are important to/appreciated by much finer people. Paula--you sound so strong and upbeat!  I can't believe you had tx on Friday!  Keep it up, girl!!!! Tinalee--you flip away, girlfriend!!!  Oh, I can almost echo exactly what Carol says about numbness.  My bad arm is the left (I'm right-dominant) and it's numb in the pit, down the underside to almost the elbow and around the back over the shoulderblade.  My last surgery was October 15, so I'm 5 months out!!!  I have significant wads (medical term) of scar tissue in my armpit and another actually an inch above the incision on my breast.  I have also developed cording (an le se) that starts in the scar tissue under my arm and extends about 1/2 way down to my elbow before it disappears into my arm.  Cording is just what it sounds like--feels like tendons that are too short and you can actually see them through my skin.  Makes straightening my arm painful/impossible.  Please, please do stretching exercises all the time to try to avoid cording.  I was doing okay till a few weeks ago when I reached for something too heavy overhead and my arm snapped (no joke) and then I had all this pain and restricted motion.  My le specialist says it will go away with time (either by snapping again to break the cord--I'm looking forward to that--or it will just be absorbed by my body).  If your doc is amenable and you have an le specialist in the area, it wouldn't hurt to have an evaluation to be measured and checked for le.  Even though the appointments are a hassle, the le massage has been very restorative for me.  I want my le gal to move in so I can have one every day! Carol--hope the pizza hit the spot.  Oh, and you know, I'd get the sleeve.  You may remember when I was name-dropping over the holidays that I sat next to Hoda Kotb from NBC on the train?  Well, she was never diagnosed with le, but she got a sleeve for flying, too.  Preventative.  Le is serious, whether some of our docs believe it or not.  You've all seen those older women with one giant leg?  Well, that will be our arms if we don't pay attention.  My le specialist said at first she wants me to always wear my sleeve when I fly, particularly if I'm still having some fluid, but that eventually, I may be able to control the fluid with massage and get away with flying on short flights (under 1 1/2 hours) without it.  Sorry to sound like such a zealot, but I'm experiencing discomfort/pain from le and I now know it's for real.  I don't want anyone else to have this. LWDana--You made it!!!  The final sparkle is on the Jewels!  Be ready to be a little buzzed all day today from the drugs.  And do all your preventative stuff, even though you have no se's today.  Learn from the rest of us that it's better to be proactive than it is to wait till something's wrong.  This is all manageable.  We're here! Okay, so my dream from last night.  It was one of those repeaters.  I kept getting a phone call from a woman asking me about my magazine subscriptions and while we were talking, I'd open my eyes and the woman (dressed in a black burka) would be standing next to my bed.  I kept jerking awake and she'd go away.  Weird thing, every time I had the dream (3 times) the woman was closer to me and the last time she was reaching out to touch me.  Put me into my night sweats, which soaked the sheets (and I'd just washed them yesty--figures).  Not sure what it means, but I'm taking a book to my appt today--no more magazines!  Anyone into dream interpretation? Hmm.  g2g (I always do this).  I have 40 minutes to get my house ready for the cleaners, shower and get to my le appt.  AND I have my back spasms today (I'm trying to bouy myself by repeating it's the last time, it's the last time!). Later sparkles. D1",

      "Content": "Mar 10, 2008 03:04PM Determined1 wrote: So, Happy Belated to our friend, Carol!!!!!!!  I thought about you all day and even sang out loud to you.  Hope you heard me!!  (Or, maybe not...)  How's the day after birthday girl holding up?  Did the german choc cake tickle your tastebuds (thank goodness you caught the oil--oy!!!!)?  I hope you got all the fine things you wanted and certainly deserve. Hey Deb.  Glad to hear you're bouncing back.  It seems to me that the last tx was hard on you.  I'm thinking it may be because there was so much going on at home.  I wish much easier times for you ahead.  Oh, and I have to jump on to the vaca planning!  We did a long driving trip one year and saw Zion/Bryce/Arches (and some others, but if you do those and shorten it up, you'll have time for more hiking/animal watching).  Absolutely breathtaking.  I also particularly enjoyed Alaska (took a boat trip--not what you're thinking, we were on a boat that held 35 passengers and got off to kayak and hike every day).  We also saw Mt. McKinley and float planed in to an inn where we did more hiking on the tundra (very cool)--this place only had outhouses, which my dh didn't mention till our plane was touching down on their lake!  Last recommendation is to visit Charleston, SC--good eats, walking around and shopping, but not much nature stuff! Birfday girl--so you're having a hard time keeping your hands warm?  Neuropathy, maybe?  Do you notice the le hand is colder?  (I do.)  The issue has come and gone for me on my good side, so I'm guessing it's neuropathy.  I will say my le side is still cold/numb sometimes. Paula--That was GREAT news from your conference!  I'm still teary from reading about your tribute.  And we thought teenagers were self-absorbed cretins...  You give us hope that some bright lights are shining out there.  I loved the acronym for my le guru, altho I may use legu so she won't be confused with my leg! I can't believe A. Flo is still visiting you, Vettegal!  (The Force must be strong with this one, Luke...) KathyL--Nails.  Yes, my fingernails (not my thumbs, tho) are all purple in the middle of each nail for about a third of the nail.  I go through periods when it feels like it does when you press on a bruise, but you don't have to touch my nails to elicit that hurt--they just feel that way on their own.  My toenails were having the same feelings, but they've been painted the whole time, so I didn't know if they were purple, too.  Well, I went in for a mani/pedi today (I know, I shouldn't but my tech is very good to me and cleans everything with rubbing alcohol several times throughout, so I'm going to keep up that vice), and when she removed the toenail polish, I was relieved to see that my toenails look the same as always.  Even though they hurt.  I wonder if the polish had something to do with that???  I am using the tea tree oil on my fingernails every night before bed (I don't know if it does anything other than stink).  When I went in for my last infusion, I asked my chemo nurse about my nails and she said that since mine were not getting thick, or curling, she thought I would stand a good chance to keep mine.  She did confirm what you heard about the purple lines for each tx--likening it to the rings in a tree.  Apparently, if we don't lose our nails, they will eventually grow out and be okay.  Mine started turning color/hurting about a week after tx3. Oh, have a grand time at the dance tonight.  What precious memories!!!  Enjoy. LWDana--you sound good.  And you're eating better, that's a good thing.  Do you go in for tx2 this week? Ah, SIS Kimberly, what a divine-sounding Sunday!  Would you please start sending that sunshine to the east???  Hey, good luck tomorrow, our caped crusader! Julie--I think tired is much better than throwing up.  Give yourself some space and just zone out when you feel like it.  The tired thing is overwhelming to me this time and I'm trying really hard to set aside about 2 hours in the early afternoon to sit and veg.  Not my MO.  But we have to be good to ourselves.  I'll think of you in veg-land at about 2p, if you'll think of me! Here's a new one.  The ear pierce hole on my bad side is suddenly developing issues with some of my earrings.  The hole is crusty and red.  I've been applying rubbing alcohol and have switched over to some 18K earrings for the time-being.  I have never had problems with earrings before--I've even been able to wear that cheap crap they sell at Claire's without worry.  This is all new to me.  Anyone else with this? Oh and yeah, I obviously got my nails done with college girl today.  What a treat she is! So tomorrow--SIS Kimberly and Kris60 are donning their capes and flying in for a fix!!!  Go show cancer who's boss, my SHEROS!!!!!!!!! D1",

Dana--thanks for the suggestion of neosporin.  I'll give it a try. I'm thinking of FUBCFU for the license plate, SIS Kimberly.  Is that overkill? Jenn--weird how you postponed your exams so that you'd find your cancer.  The world is so mysterious sometimes, isn't it?  Easy to say, but try not to worry about the MUGA till you see your onc.  I always try to remind myself that worrying isn't going to change anything and just gets me all wrapped up.  But I completely understand that it's niggling at the back of your mind.  Try to focus on your le therapy today.  I hope its as relaxing as mine is (love that light touch massage).  And focus on getting that age down under 100!!!!  (Boy, did I relate to that comment!) Gosh, Paula, temp of 101?  Hope the meds are bringing that down.  I know that temp would've landed me in a hospital bed, so my fingers are crossed that you're getting in to the normal range by now.  Perhaps that good night of sleep is just what you needed.  Try to enjoy some of that sunshine.  I'm hoping I get out in it, myself. Three cheers for Carol's pooper!!!!!!  Good to hear from you as you head out.  I hope today goes well.  Is the xMIL tagging along? I'm getting a little paranoid because my new, young radonc said he'd call on Monday with my rad pre-tests and dates and such and I haven't heard from him, yet.  Since the mind is such a wasteland, I'm swirling around thoughts that he looked more closely at the cd I took in (held mammos, MRI, CT, bone scans) and didn't like what he saw, or he just plain old decided he doesn't want me as a patient.  Or, or, or...  What a dolt I am.  I should probably just pick up the phone myself today and see what's up, but I don't want to know at the same time.  I should repeat--what a dolt I am. Oh, Deb, fingernails aren't quite as hurty starting yesty and I've found I can pick my nose again!!!!  :)  (Although they look like I've gone grunge.  It's a nice balance to the hip hop doorag on my head.  Not a combination most would think should go together--particularly on a 50 year old bald woman--but I'm pulling it off!) Off to see my legu this morning and then to do some bloodletting (not sure when I get to stop doing that).  Hopefully I'll have time for lunch with a friend or maybe some fabric shopping for new curtains for my kitchen/fam room (the ones we have are literally falling off the walls!).  I won't have time for anything if I don't get away from this computer! Later. Thinking about Carol, Judy, Joan and Wendy today! D1",

Joan--Just succumb into the fog and rest, rest, rest, and drink fluids.  It will lift soon.  Just lurk away till it does. Carol, I sure understand about the fatigue.  And I can totally feel for your trepidation about what it bodes for the future.  But just keep putting one foot in front of the other and you'll make it through.  Maybe our reunion ought to be a gigantic sleepover!!!! KathyL--sounds like the hat was the perfect perk-me-up before your last tx.  Keep your attitude and conviction on track (I lost my way a little right before my last one).  You'll get through it. I was thinking about how each of us marches in to our tx's with a smile on our faces and we know what we're doing is going to kick us on our asses, make us hurt, give us painful side effects, and yet we march on.  I know I always went running in with my hair flowing behind me (well, it would've been flowing if I had any) screaming FUBC at the top of my lungs.  Then it dawned on me.  The way we go in for tx, time after time, must be a lot like how our military personnel feel as they race headlong in to battle.  You know the outcome is going to have side effects, but you run in there, screaming at the top of your lungs.  F*ck the world--cause I'm about to be f*cked and there isn't a thing I can do about it, but be a warrior.  (Well, there's a little sidebar for ya.  So was it motivational, KathyL?  It started out that way then I got distracted.  Bottom line?  Give 'em hell on Wednesday!) Wow, Paula, sounds like the dh made a good recovery this time.  Thank goodness.  And the ds got to work out his arm during the scrimmage.  It's all good. LWDana--maybe it was rude, maybe it was people just being human.  Sounds like you grabbed the reins, tho, and made the situation good for yourself, which is important, since we all know ITS DANA TIME.  Let the rest roll off your back. Oh Tina, I'm a former Michigander, so I hear you on the long winters.  But it sounds like the sun is starting to shine more brightly on you.  (Hey, you a Vikes fan, perchance?  I sure could use some company cheering them on next season...) Speaking of MI, Sheshe, I'm so sorry your path has been so difficult.  You sound like such a strong and determined person, though, so I have faith in you.  You will overcome all of this.  Just keep your focus.  We're always here for a good vent, too. SIS Kimberly--how lucid you sound today!  Good for you.  I hope the fog doesn't get you down (it will clear, just remember that). Vettegal, will you just wrap that Vetteguy up and send him my way?  First he's sensitive and caring and then he says nice things about my pic.  I could use some of that here!!! Got my compression garment at my le session today.  Fugliest bra on the planet (they should put some lace on these things).  But if it works, I'm all over that.  Also got my sleeve and glove, but I don't have those on, yet.  Can't do it all at once! Also heard from my radonc's office again today.  (Things are moving!!)  I have my CT scan and rad simulation scheduled for next Thursday.  Still waiting to hear from my neighborhood hospital about the MRI, but I suspect that's more their issue than my radonc's since I've already heard from G'town and both hospitals were waiting for the orders before scheduling me.  I'm a little nervous, but impatient, too. Well, gonna see if I can do something outside--it's really pretty here today. Hope Paula and Deb are doing okay in the lounge. D1",

      "Content": "Mar 23, 2008 04:49PM Determined1 wrote: Happy Easter, Jewels!!!! Hope the Easter bunny hippity hopped your way. Sorry to be MIA.  With my mom in town, we were so busy I never even turned the computer on!  We took her to the airport a few hours ago and since then, I've been trying to catch up.  We had a good visit, saw college girl, went downtown for a fancy lunch, played tourist in DC for a day and spent 5 hours at Georgetown Hospital having my simulation, CT scan, and then giving mom the tour and introducing her to my chemo nurses (who still remembered my name!).  It was a whirlwind and I was fried most of the time (not used to the activity), but it made me very happy. Shout out time! Therese--you sound normal to me.  I felt naked, too, till I got my rad schedule.  Its funny how quickly we adapt to the life of cancer patient and expect docs and tx's as part of our routines.  I imagine being cut loose makes you feel as though they've removed the net below your act.  Its totally normal to be aware of your aches and pains and to be concerned because you know you don't have a doc appt coming up to discuss them.  You should know, tho, that I'm having all kinds of trouble with aches and pains after exercising since tx4 and I worked out the whole time I did chemo.  Now I can't go as fast or as long on the ellipitcal, I don't lift as much weight, and everything in my body seems to be hurting non-stop as though I've never worked out before.  I think our bodies have had enough and bouncing back won't be as quick or easy as we'd originally thought.  Take your time and listen to your body.  You will be normal again--just like the rest of us will. KathyL--Girl, I sent you every vibe I could muster on Weds and I can't tell you how happy I am that there was no reaction!  You made it!!  Now just a couple more days before your fog completely dissipates.  Can you believe it???  Oh, you MUST post the recipe. CarolC--Yay, last tx!!!  Your fog will pass soon, too.  Try not to be too impatient with it (I was--I had absolutely NO TIME for se's after my last tx--I was SO OVER the whole thing, but unfortunately, my body had to go through the entire se process.  Good news is, it WILL pass!).  Hang in there. Oh SIS Kimberly, I'm sorry about the hard time with the se's.  And here I took off to have fun.  (Let me do the guilt, part of my family heritage--it passes, not to worry.)  The mouth sore sounds fun--NOT.  My sores stayed inside my mouth, I guess I should be grateful.  Hope that clears up soon. Hey, Vettegal--was that your hospital that imploded this weekend in Pittsburgh?  Guess it couldn't take the fact that they gave you the sharts and didn't take away A. Flo, huh?  Great news about your mom--I hope Denise hears good things, too.  Hey, could you be teary because your lashes are MIA?  I know I've been more teary for about 6 weeks (stand up or lay down and my eyes water like mad) and it's not a cold or allergies--its cause I have no lashes to hold the tears in!  Just a thought.  Oh, and yep, that was me honking like crazy!! CHJ--I like the way you said sometimes we have to be the guest of honor at our own pity parties.  It was right on.  Hopefully you're not having one of those sadness soirees now, but if you are, come by and let us know how its going.  We're here for you. Jenn--I fully understand your comment about dreading #4 as you weren't over the se's from #3--I felt the same way right before my #4.  I know you're in se land about now, I hope your trip is easy this time.  Oh, and you made me smile with your comment about arranging the Easter stuff \"just so.\"  I'm the same way.  Nobody does it better! Whoa, Julie, I'm so impressed that one of your students is headed to the London School of Econ!  Testimony to great teachers along the way (that was a compliment!).  I'm glad you got to spend some time with your cousins and laugh a lot--its the best medicine.  Speaking of laughing, I LOVED the cartoon! LWDana--Mea culpa for missing the b-day.  I thought about you and hoped you were having a good day (my mom and I celebrated her 70th bday on your day and had a mahvelous time, dahling, we even drank a toast to you).  You made me lol about the hiding behind the hair color comment--unlike you, I can't wait to hide behind hair color again--I am NOT going to look my age (I don't act it, why should I look it???).  Oh, and I second KathyL's comments to you.  Always feel like you can express yourself here.  Here's hoping those counts are better. As you can tell, Joan, I can't wait for my hair, either! Oh Deb, I'm so sorry you're having so much trouble with your hands and feet.  I hope you're getting the pain under control.  At least there are enough upsets in the NCAAs this year to make watching the games interesting!  (I can't wait for the Duke women to be on TV, my eldest played against the freshman, Jasmine Thomas, for years!  That girl has afterburners, that's for sure!) LJ13--Whoohoo!  (Hope that's okay, SIS Kimberly!)  You're halfway done!!! Paula--Congrats on the ds's hits and WV's win over Duke!  Oh, and thanks for checking on me. Maz--Hope the extra decadron does the trick.  They tapered my off after a couple of tx's as I was crashing so hard when I stopped taking it.  It helped me--here's hoping the same for you.  You know, your extra weight might be from the puffiness some of us have.  When that goes away, we may find some relief on the scales (I'm still waiting for that to happen...).  Glad you heard from Val, I have a feeling you will both help each other through this period.  I'll be thinking of you. New avatar, Tina?  Looks good.  I liked your update while you were at the chemo bar.  Your attitude sounds really good--I hope your se's are mild. CathyCA--Well, I've been emoting more lately, too, but I think I would've been a mess at your teacher's funeral even without chemo.  What a life story she had! Hey Carol, hope the cation is going well and that you got some good sleep so you could golf your heart out.  Oh, my onc felt me up before every visit to the chemo bar (I thought that kind of stuff usually happened AFTER you were at the bar, but it's been a while for me--what do I know?).  Now my new rad onc (I've taken to calling him babydoc, because he's young), feels me up when I see him.  Must be the guys over at Georgetown... Sheshe--Some of the best news I read--negative scan results!!!  Hip, hip hooray!!! Sista2, boy I hope the taxotere treats you kindly.  And I was happy to see I'm not the only one who's a sucker for a guy with a sweet face and a guitar--I like Jason, too.  I also go for David Cook, who should probably win the whole thing.  Time will tell. Hey Peg, did you catch my toot last Weds?  I bumped the horn at the Hagerstown turnoff on my way to visit my college girl. Okay, going to submit this and then I'll give you all the details of what's going on with me in the next post... D1",

The bil is being taken off the ventilator today.  His docs are prepping us for him to take a bit of a dive as a result.  I'm just hoping he's able to pull himself back up and not get into a free-fall.  Just sitting here, biting my nails, waiting for a report... Jenn--I'm still having nightmares from my guide wire procedure--getting tats doesn't even begin to compare!  I go for rads M-F for 6 weeks (total of 30 zaps).  I can already see that it will get old fast.  Right now I have more energy than I've had in months!  I'm hoping that my exercise regimen will allow me to avoid rad fatigue for a little longer than most... Carol--Sounds like quite a day at Harmony Hill.  I guess it was a good thing that you weren't the one with the saddest story, but it must've been hard to comfort others when you went for a little TLC for you.  When you started writing that you were supposed to get comfy for the tape, all I could think was, \"Doh! The recliner's at home!!\"  Glad you found the sunshine and got your catnap. Yeah, rads do aggravate le.  I thnk that's why it upset me when babydoc told me that.  After I got over feeling sorry for myself, I put on my warrior armor, screamed FUBC at the top of my lungs, and started getting aggressive about my le tx.  That's why I wear the damn torture garment everyday and wear my sleeve to work out.  I'm gonna do the best I can and hope I can catch a break. Paula--Yeah, I THOUGHT the dye injection was the worst till they did the guide wire procedure!  If I ever need that again, they'll have to knock me out, first! Take your rings off (I had to) so they don't have to be cut off.  And elevate swollen body parts as appropriate (I've found it helps temporarily).  Keep telling yourself, \"this, too, shall pass.\" Vettegal--good to hear from you!!!  Looking forward to the rads report. Wendy--A transfusion???!  Make sure you talk to your onc before they do anything.  (Stupid nurse.) KathyL--LOL at the \"vision\" of you with dialated eyes and driving!  Good news for you is that at 6 weeks, my energy level is the best its been since before chemo started.  I feel great!!  (Try not to focus on the swelling--or other se's that are still around--there's much good to being done.) SIS Kimberly--Chemo-brain sitter--I like that!  Oh, and I'll get out my gigantic lantern to lead you out of the fog, girlfriend.  Be on the lookout! Big ol' FUBC thoughts to LJ13 and LWDana for tomorrow!  Go get 'em, girls!!! Gonna go watch my tivo'd American Idols--haven't been able to read the paper today because they always spill the beans!  I should be able to surprise myself this week! D1",

KathyL--Yeah, I can't imagine going back to the chemo room for the H.  When my mom was here a couple of weeks ago, I took her to my chemo lounge so she could see it, but I got panicky and declined to show her the chairs I sat in when she asked me to do so.  I thought it was just me having those feelings of not wanting to look back, but I guess not.  I hope it went okay today. Tinalee--Good thoughts to your co-worker at this scary time.  I know we all remember this period of the journey all too well. Oh yeah, Julie, you do your happy dance!  Glad you're outta the fog. The chocolate's right, Maz, if we can do it, you KNOW you can!  FUBC!! Carol--Who'da thunk you'd been doing site inspections for the Jewels on all those cations to AZ over the years.  Thanks for lending your cation expertise.  Hang on to your tummy, girlfriend! Hey, AZDonna, Deb and SIS Kimberly.  Hope you're all lurking while the fog passes.  I'm holding my lantern high and I think Carol's laying on the foghorn--you should find your way back to us soon.

Whisk the ricotta, spinach, 1 cup Parmesan, prosciutto, egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl to blend. Add a tablespoon or 2 of oil to a large pot of boiling salted water. Boil the noodles until just tender but still firm to bite. Drain. Arrange the noodles in a single layer on a baking sheet to prevent them from sticking. Butter a 13-by-9-by-2-inch glass baking dish. Pour the bechamel sauce over the bottom of the prepared dish. Lay out 4 lasagna noodles on a work surface, then spread about 3 tablespoons of ricotta mixture evenly over each noodle. Starting at 1 end, roll each noodle like a jelly roll. Lay the lasagna rolls seam side down, without touching, atop the bechamelsauce in the dish. Repeat with the remaining noodles and ricotta mixture. Spoon 1 cup of marinara sauce over the lasagna rolls. Sprinkle the mozzarella and remaining 2 tablespoons of Parmesan over the lasagna rolls. Cover tightly with foil. Bake until heated through and the sauce bubbles, about 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until the cheese on top becomes golden, about 15 minutes longer. Let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining marinara sauce in a heavy small saucepan over medium heat until hot, and serve alongside.",

      "Content": "Apr 1, 2008 05:14PM Determined1 wrote: Hey everyone!  Beautiful day here in our Nation's Capital.  I think it must be 70 degrees! Rads are MUCH easier than I expected (so far).  I've already had 2 sessions.  Looks like my experience will be about one to one and a half hours, depending on whether or not I get to visit with babydoc.  (Remember, that includes my travel time--I drive 20-25 mins. each way to go less than 5 miles!  Gotta love city living.)  Okay, so I arrive in the rads dept and check in.  Grab my book.  They call my name a few minutes later.  I toddle off to the treatment area and either go into a changing booth or wait in a small waiting area for a changing booth to be free.  Try to read a couple more paragrahs.  Get into changing booth and get nekkie from waist up and put on a hospital gown.  Oh, can't wear lotions or deoderant to my sessions, so I pack that in my bag and apply after tanning.  Go into rad room (okay, its a little intimidating with all the \"danger\" signs around and the equipment, but they try to make you comfy).  Lie down on table (they put some cushions and sheets on it for me).  They line me up using red laser beams that seem to come out of the walls and ceiling all over the place--I'm like a moth drawn to a light and can't stop staring at the one in the ceiling while being zapped.  I'll probably suffer cornea damage as a se of rads--first person ever!!!  After I'm all lined up, this big x-ray looking thing zeroes in on my body and then a loud mechanical noise starts up for about 20 seconds.  Then it stops and the x-ray thing rotates to line up on my pit area (thanks to those positive nodes) and makes noise for another 20 seconds.  I feel nothing.  The worst part is when I have to put bad arm over my head and rest it in an \"arm holder.\"  Because of my cording, bad arm doesn't go that way w/o agony, so I have to have the techs put my arm SLOWLY into the holder.  I wince a lot, but I tell them to just go for it because what else can I do?  Then I have to have the techs pull my arm down out of the holder.  I'm hoping that gets easier over time. When I finish, I go back to my changing booth, slather on my lotion (they tell me I don't need it till I start burning, but I figure it can't hurt), apply deoderant (they recommend Tom's of Maine--can't use anything with an anti-perspirant), and get dressed.  Then I just blow outta there.  Easy. Jenn, the first tat I got (at my sim session) really hurt, but mostly because I'm afraid of needles and I didn't know what to expect.  It felt like a bad bee sting, but it didn't last long.  The last 2 tats I got yesty didn't bother me as much and they were in a more sensitive area.  I got out my Lamaze breathing for the two yesty and was so distracted trying to breathe properly that it helped with the discomfort.  Oddly, all of them bled like crazy and I had to wash my torture garment when I got home (good excuse to take the damn thing off).  All three are black and about the size of a head of a pin.  One will show when I wear plunging necklines, but until I get rid of my torture garment, there will be no plunging necklines, so I guess I\"ll be okay.  When there's more to report, I'll share. CathyCA--have a great time in Sacramento.  I've been to only one Boss concert, but he gives a GREAT show.  Oddly, my little one first learned the Springsteen songbook when she was 11-12 years old when she started playing guitar.  I still smile when I hear her play Thunder Road. Oh Jenn, you had me LOL with the story of the pic of the poopy after party! Carol--smart move to quit for the day after that chemo brain delivery!  What a hoot (I mean a laugh, not a boob).  Glad your compression sleeve worked on the flight.  I have to get another one made for me as the one I have is about an inch too short and cuts the circulation off at my wrist.  I do get tingly fingers from wearing it, so I only wear it 2 hours at a time now.  Not sure what I'll do on long flights...  Yep, the torture garment is like wearing a giant compression sleeve.  I think you understand why I complain about it... Hey, girlfriend, the meltdown is totally acceptable.  Think about what was going on there!  Please allow yourself your emotions.  You're first class all the way, don't sweat it. Can I have a secret pal, too?  Pretty pretty please????  Sounds like fun--however you decide to work it out. Oh, and keep those sharts in check this time!!! Sunshine--glad you got away with your dh.  It's good for the soul.  You numb and discolored fingers sound really familiar to me.  You should know I did the tea tree oil religiously and still ended up with the blood under my nails.  I'm not sure there's really anything we can do about some of these se's. Tinalee-A snowstorm???  You guys need a break up there.  Oh, and I'll forward my bag of courage--it never fails me. Paula--Thank goodness you're getting some sleep and the pain is lessening.  Like I often read around here, \"better living through chemistry!\" KathyL--Hate to tell you, but I'm almost 5 wks since last chemo and I'm still quite puffy.  Eyes only seem to be bad in the morning, but other body parts are puffy 24/7.  I think it'll take a while for all of the poison to be out.  It's just hard to be patient when you're done w/chemo, isn't it?  When you're done, you're DONE.  Oh, and thanks for the encouragement not to wrap my nails.  It made sense to me not to wrap them, but I thought I'd seek a professional's advice. You should know I tried your brownie recipe and made lots of friends.  We took a bunch up to college girl, thinking she could share them, but she says she's going to pig out on them all by herself.  (Maybe share with that new guy???) Please send some healing thoughts to my brother-in-law (dh's brother).  He went to the ER yesty and was dx'd with bacterial spinal meningitis.  Luckily, he survived the night, but his med team wants him to live for 24-48 more hours before doing an MRI to see if there's any brain damage.  He's 55 years old and maybe eats food that's too rich, but he's a really good egg and I love him dearly.  He and his partner just moved from San Diego to Norfolk about 2 months ago, so they're nearby, which is good as my in-laws were able to get to Norfolk early this morning to be with him (the in-laws live near me).  I'm waiting for my dh to decide he should drive down there, but he's trying to put on the brave front for now.  I just hope my bil pulls through this--I don't think any of us are ready to let him go just yet. Sorry to be so heavy--it's on my mind. Good luck tomorrow to Joan (last one!!!!) and Sheebas.  Don't get all crazy on us in the lounge! D1 (You doin' okay, Vettegal???)",

Tinalee--I'm glad your onc is working with you on the amount of Taxol.  Anything that can be done to make this tolerable and effective they should be doing.  Luckily I don't have to keep my choppers in my pocket like Uncle Lloyd, but that would make those dental cleanings a whole lot easier!  :) Oh yeah, Carol, hairless beavers!!!  (Hmmm, I think there's a double entendre buried in that one...) You sound good, Therese.  It seems we're both moving at about the same pace post chemo.  I'll be interested to see if/when I start to fade off a bit from the rad se's.  Oh, and it sounds as though your hair is doing better than mine.  In my eternal optimism, I have a hair appointment that I keep moving back--eventually I'll keep it! Oh Julie, you've really had a tough go with the migraines.  I hope this one has cleared up by the time I make this post. Rad Report.  I have finished my first week without incident and without being late for my appointment!  Woohoo!  (Where's SIS Kimberly when you need her?)  The surprise today was that they took xrays at the end of my zapping for babydoc's review.  Apparently this is SOP at my shop.  So plan a few extra minutes on the end of that Friday rad appointment for those pix.  Fortunately for me, the xrays are taken right while I'm on the rad table, so no moving or getting into position (ow, that hurts my arm!) a second time.  I meet with babydoc every Tuesday, so I'll know what's up with the xrays after that appointment.  Still hanging in. Thanks everyone, for the good thoughts for my bil.  They tried to get him off the ventilator yesty, but he was unresponsive and so they put him back on.  They tried again today and lo and behold, he opened his eyes and smiled!!!!  Then he started in on the complaining--the bed's too short (we're tall people), the tubes bug him, etc.  We all take this as a VERY good sign.  Not sure when they're going to do the MRI to check on his brain, but I'll take this happy news for now and be content (besides, my dh's family is Scandinavian and don't get into details or emotions very well, so I've learned over the years to take what I can get and hope for more later!).  Thanks again for including him in your thoughts. Guess I should get on my laundry pile now.  Dh returns home from a road trip tonight and I like to have things tidied up around here for him. Later. D1",

Oh no, more bad news for Vettesis.  I know you can help to guide her to learn more about her situation/choices.  Knowledge will help.  Please continue to encourage her to come here.  We remember how scary the time is when you're first dx'd.  I'll send her my best coping thoughts. Joan--Glad you're feeling better.  I slather on a cream babydoc gave me called Alra.  It has aloe vera, vitamin e, collagen and other good things in it.  Makes my boobala super soft.  Pink was gone by this morning, but after zapping today, its baaaack.  I burn really easily (blisters on my shoulders from the sun when I was young was normal for me), so I'm not surprised.  But thanks for the reminder to peek at the rads threads--I haven't been there for at least a week. Julie--Hope you had sweet dreams last night.  And what's with the migraines?  Haven't you had enough already??! KathyL--OMG, what a bitch!  I hate that kind of person as a health care provider.  You need to take her down! Deb--Your taxotere se's sound painfully familiar.  I'm so sorry you're having so many.  Hope you're getting some sleep--seems no one else around here is...  The sleep will help you tolerate your se's till they pass (they WILL pass, eventually).  :) Congrats, Kris!!!!  Keep those se's down this last time. Sista2--Sorry you're fighting a fever, but you made me smile when you mentioned that at least you didn't notice your hot flashes.  Way to find the silver lining!  Good luck tomorrow. SIS Kimberly--Get well soon!  We're all pulling for ya!!  (Thanks, Carol, for the updates, I was getting worried.) Good luck tomorrow to  Jenn, Maz and Sista at the lounge.  May your cocktails go down smoothly and bring on only the teeniest of hangovers! D1",

Went directly to p/u college girl after my rad appt today.  As always, good to see her.  She was bumming because the boy she met is more interested in her roommate than her (might explain why he was interested in talking), so the boy thing is off for now.  Anyway, as soon as we got home (I got up at 6:30 this a.m. and was in action--no exaggeration--till we got home at 5:30pm) I had to start dinner.  Dh returned from Dallas tonight (on American Airlines, no less!) and everyone wanted to be fed lasagne rolls and sweet potatoes by 8p.  Those lasagne rolls are tasty, but labor intensive (and dirty every hand wash dish in the house!).  I should have never agreed to make that after such a long day.  Live and learn... Sooooooo...... DCMom--I haven't done Taxol myself, but you've heard from some of our experts already.  But I live in Arlington, VA and just found out about an event to be held at the Nordstrom at Pentagon City on April 21.  Its sponsored by Chemoflage (www.chemoflage.com).  It supports women going thru chemo.  Not sure of the time, but I have a number to call for info--703-224-2456.  Its the first meeting.  I think I'm going to go if the time is good for me.  Oh, and stop in here anytime, you're always welcome. Jenn--You're a star in my book, even with chemo brain. Vettegal--(Did you hear me honk at you today as I passed into PA?  I always think of you and PALady whenever I go to Carlisle.)  I was fried with exhaustion till I was about a month out from my last tx.  Once you turn the corner, you'll be amazed (then you'll do rads and get tired all over again, but that's another story).  I promise you'll get your energy back. Sheshe--Good to hear from you, fellow Vernor's imbiber!  Sorry the new onc isn't up to snuff.  I've done 2 weeks of rads so far, but no form for my Frankenboob, guess she's not big enuf! Paula--I'm sorry the storms nixed your games.  I think the rain has just started here.  Thanks for sending it our way???? Julie/KathyL--I was shocked at the AI elimination.  That contestant was not going to win, but I agree with KathyL that others should have gone first.  (I am loving David Cook--once I got over Jason's blue eyes and his John Sebastian channel.) Carol--Skaters have to get up before the light of day????  I'll stick with bball... Maz--So glad to hear the therapist is working out--is he able to help you cope with Val's situation, too? SIS Kimberly--hang in there, we're here, holding you up when you're feeling down.  Hope the antibiotics do the trick.  I cannot imagine dealing with an infection during the fog.  Talk about a SHERO... I know we have some Jewels who have been quiet lately.  I hope that's because they are content to lurk for now.  And may everyone who had tx this past week experience minimal se's. Oh, and Frankenboob seems to be pink for the duration now.  Nothing is unbearably painful, yet, but my scar tissue really aches (I describe it as feeling angry, rather than really aching--not sure if that makes sense...).  Can't wait to see babydoc to ask about that next week. Not sure I'll be online much tomorrow.  When I do my family thang, I seem to disappear.  But please know you're all on my mind. D1",

I hadn't heard about the fire, Tinalee.  How awful.  I'm glad no humans were hurt, but I'll bet there were plenty of living things that didn't fare as well. How cool, Carol!!!  Almost makes we want to join a Curves-almost (I'm such a gym rat and I love my community rec center...). Hope the schnoz is okay.  Maybe as I read more of the posts I'll see the outcome. Way to go on Gonzaga!!!  Sorry about the tuition increase, but if she's inspired there, that's what counts.  Sounds like a summer job, loans, etc., etc.  Maybe there's some grant money available through your county or an organization to which she has belonged?  Maybe a Google search will help you find them? Ankle is purple and green, but she's walking on it.  She's wearing one of those supported ankle braces on it (the ones that lace up and have \"ribs\" imbedded into them for support).  She came home from school today all whiny because she couldn't exercise (this kid will go to the gym if she doesn't have practice-even worse, if she comes home from practice and didn't sweat enough, she hops on the treadmill.  Weirdo.).  I tell her to take a break and she'll be on the hardwood again in no time.  Easy for me to say. SIS Kimberly-Sounds like you had quite the visit for your abx tx.  I'll bet you were happy to have the port for all that activity.  I've done emla cream before and I just put Saran Wrap over it-no taping.  Course, you're probably already at the bar, so my 2 cents is too little too late. Dd is really a talented writer (she must've been separated from you at birth).  Her SAT scores on the writing section were 780 out of 800!!!  (We won't talk about her math score.)  She wants to study something that will allow her to hone her writing skills (I'd say that's pretty much anything, but I think she's looking at English/Humanities).  She's already sweating the admissions process at Vassar because they are only accepting 17% of applicants this year and they said the number will likely go down in the future because so many talented students are applying.  I just think dd has much to offer, so she shouldn't worry so much (besides, she's padding her activities with basketball, yearbook editor, NHS, Spanish Honors Society, volunteering at the Food Bank and a part-time job.  All that has GOT to count for something!).  Anyway, applications are several months away, so time to relax for a while. WVGirl-Ugh on the new lump.  Hopefully, they can take care of it during your surgery.  When are you having your surgery? I must say, Carol pretty much summed up my thoughts on the DH.  I'm sorry you're having to cope with his negative attitude while you're on the bc journey.  Like you don't have enough to handle.  Carol's idea of finding positive support somewhere else is a good one.  I hope it works out for you okay. Dana-you absolutely MUST keep something on your lips at all times.  I had a devil of a time with dry, chapping lips.  I used Burt's Bees at night and one of those Clinique glosses that applies with a spongy wand (I got it for free at my LGFB seminar and it has really been great-I'll be buying one when it runs out).  Not sure how to clear up the mess you have-I just kept applying stuff to my lips and it cleared eventually.  Then I kept them moisturized and I didn't have any more trouble.  Hope that helps.  Thinking of you getting your MRI... KathyL-Yep, we were on 95.  I was honking and waving-embarrassed my family, I think.  Hope the acne meds clear things up-I agree with you that we are too old to deal with zits. Enjoy that honor banquet, Paula.  Better pack some tissues, just in case you get those proud mama tears! Hmmm.  Dd is hungry, so I should rustle up some grub.  (Actually, we're eating all the food out of our basement freezer as it appears to be dying-it's 20 years old, so it's time.  So only reheating for me!  Oh, if anyone has an upright deep freezer that they love and want to recommend, I'm all ears.  We'll be buying a new one in a few weeks, I'm sure.)

PALady-You describe the nail thing very well.  Nine of my 10 fingernails have separated from the skin to about 2/3 of the way down the nail, too.  Like you, I'm trying to keep them short and not catch them on anything that will bend the nail back or pull it away from the nailbed.  Not sure I'll be able to hang on to all of them, but I'm really trying.  Not sure about the alligator skin-I'm using those free Clinique samples of dramatically different moisturizing lotion on my face and head.  Seems to be working.  Oh, I just got a Neutrogena night cream they said was really good on one of the Today show segments-it's the one that comes in a white and deep purplish tube.  Have only used it once, but it made my skin feel great.  I'm just trying to use up the free stuff I got at my LGFB seminar-can't seem to make myself throw that stuff out. SIS Kimberly-you truly are a SHERO, passing the cape with all of its powers on to someone else.  That was a wonderful thing to do.  Hope you're still doing okay with all the things you have on your plate right now.  (Still thinking \"soft mounds...\") Hang in there Chemo-brained LWDana.  You can do it! OMG, Vettegal-I've been meaning to bring up the subject of gas, too!  I cannot seem to shake it.  Unlike when I was doing chemo, this gas isn't so smelly, but it's still obnoxiously noisy.  No sneaking these bad boys out on a crowded elevator!  I'm not really taking anything for it, but am trying to wait it out.  Dh claims I let \u2018em rip in my sleep at night.  I'm sure it enhances my whole sexy, bald siren thing I got going on. Oh, and I still have one swollen ankle left.  It's not only swollen, but the achilles' tendon on that foot is so painful I have a hard time negotiating stairs.  Like LJ13 said, I'm just trying to elevate it when I can and am hoping for the best. Paula-You're too kind with the parenting compliments.  We tend to think our kids are turning out okay DESPITE our parenting efforts!  ;) KathyL-Congrats on the new nip!  It probably is hard to remember that it's swollen right now and will settle to its rightful size later.  I'd be having fits!  But it sounds like my scaredy-twin (I think we're the needle weenies here) came through with flying colors!  Way to go!  And 4 lbs down-that's fabo! Oh, yeah, Shannon and Derek are doing the nasty dance.  (And I thought he was Mormon, shouldn't he abstain or something?) Tinalee-You won't believe this, but my mother did the same thing with an eyelash curler when she was demonstrating to me how to use it!  (I don't use one as a result!) Carol-I like the research you're doing on the ooph/tamox topic.  Keep on asking questions till you feel you have all the answers you need.  I'll be right behind you on this one, so your info is most welcome. Dd practiced Wed. night and didn't seem to be in any trouble at all.  But then she went to work last night (works at a toy store-on her feet the whole time) and came home begging for the icepack.  Today was a trip to 6 Flags for all the Physics students (not sure what they're learning, but she did have a worksheet she had to complete based on her experiences at the park), so I'll bet she's sore tonight.  She hasn't come home, yet, so I don't know what's up with that.  Luckily, she only has one game tomorrow at 12:30, so if she's okay from today, she'll be okay for tomorrow. KathyL-I thought I was disappointed with the AI results, too, but my dh wandered in to the family room when she was singing JC Superstar and commented that her voice sucked.  I thought her voice was amazing and I really liked JC Superstar.  But I'm not the one buying records, so maybe she was the right one to be booted.  I still like David C. and Jason's cutie eyes and dreads (what's up with David A?  I find him a little on the offensive side...) Therese-glad you're not the one popping pills, either!  I was a smiling fool when I put my leftover meds away.  Hope the knee heals up soon-it's really hard to keep kids off their feet when they're injured.  And an abscessed tooth?  I HATE the dentist, so I'm totally feeling the dh's pain. SIS Kimberly-LOL on suggesting to Vettegal that she tie her pant legs together to keep those ankle up!  Oh, got my lantern ready-keep an eye out for it. Julie-You've really had it with those migraines, haven't you?  Just lay low and get rid of the nasty.  We're pulling for you. PALady-You're not the only one getting errors on the site.  It's been a mess for the past 2 weeks, IMO.  At least it finally convinced me to compose in Word! Getting rads, Joan, isn't as bad as the sim.  Your arms are still uncomfortable, but they won't be in those positions as long.  You'll be surprised at how easy rads seem in comparison to chemo. So impressed, Carol, that you're already in training!  If you can do 6 miles the first day, you'll be good to go in September.  Not to worry. Good luck tomorrow, Paula, you sound like your head is in a good place for the last one.  Wow, it feels so good to type that about my Jewel Sisters. WVGirl-You, too, sound really strong as you get ready for tomorrow.  Here's hoping those counts are where they need to be! Heck Tina/Carol, I don't need bad weather to drink!!!! Maz, I think Val's funeral is tomorrow.  My thoughts are with you. Oh Dana, my heart just sank when I read about your results.  I hope that your new treatments and faith in God will work the miracle you seek.  I'll send you all the best healing thoughts I can muster. Well, Jewels, you're probably sick of scrolling and scrolling through my post, so it's time to wrap it up.  I am done with 20 zaps in the rad bed and have 5 more of this type to go, then I get 5 boosts to my tumor beds (so 2 more weeks!).  Armpit is raw/red and chest is blotchy and itchy.  My nipple is starting to turn inside out.  But you know what?  FUBC!!!!!!

      "Content": "Apr 30, 2008 04:12PM Determined1 wrote: Hey Jewels.  Sorry I missed you all yesterday.  I had an interesting day.  Luckily, I started out at the gym at 8a, or I would've never made it.  Here's the tale. I went in to the hospital at 10:15 for my 10:30 appointment and didn't come out till after 4p!  Seems the machines in the rads department were down (apparently this happens at G'town).  I was supposed to get my boost sim at 10:30, regular rad tx at 11:10, and see babydoc at 11:45--out by noon.  But no-o-o!  Had to be worked in to the CT schedule for the CT machine for the whole hospital for my sim--that took over 2 hours.  During this time, I realized that I was not going to make it back in to Arlington for my 1p appt with my legu, so I called to cancel that.  Then it appeared that the rad machine was working again, so I got into my gown and waited an hour and a half only to learn it broke down again on the person right before me.  So rads were out.  Then I went upstairs to be worked in to babydoc's schedule (I fell off of it waiting for my CT scan).  That took another 45 mins!  And the bad news is, since I skipped a rad tx I won't be done till May 12 now!  And I so badly wanted to be done on May 9 which meant Mother's Day would be a huge celebration.  (Babydoc suggested moving Mother's Day--at least he has a sense of humor.)  Waaaah. So, I arrive home at about 4:30 to find dd moping.  She'd been so excited for the past month because she had tickets to go see Atmosphere (rapper out of Minneapolis-not bad as he manages to actually tell stories with his songs, rather than spitting out bs about screwing his shorty or shooting someone).  Seems the girl with whom she was attending the concert called her 2 hours before they were to leave to say that her parents wouldn't let her go in to DC on a school night because her last report card was bad.  (Leads me to believe this girl didn't ask her parents for permission until the last moment.)  Anyway, dd couldn't find any other friends who could get permission at the last minute so she was forlorn.  She off-handedly said something about going with me, since I like his raps.  Well, sometimes you just gotta do the right thing by your kid.  So even tho I'd had a long, frustrating day at the hospital, I was off to a rap concert in the District!  General admission, no less (I KNEW there was a reason I only buy reserved seating at concerts anymore). Well, the rap Gods were kind to us.  Just as we pulled up to the venue (a dump in a shabby part of town), a car pulled away from the curb.  Score!  We parked right outside the place for free (parking was going to run us $20-which is why my kids always use Metro when they go to this place for concerts).  Then we went inside and were able to find a spot to stand (yikes!) to enjoy the bands that was only 4 people away from the stage.  So I stood there for 4 hours.  I listened to the warm-up bands, which sucked, and was jostled and bumped by kids on all sides.  Oddly, a young lady right behind me kept rubbing my back with her hand in a comforting way.  Either she was shit-faced or I reminded her of someone she knew that had gone through the cancer thing.  Anyway, I was by far the oldest person there.  That was weird for me.  So, Atmosphere hits the stage.  Now, I know his stuff, cause my dd listens all the time.  I can't sing along, (I can't get my mouth around the words fast enough), but I'm into the beat.  So my new dilemma is, how much physical demonstration can I do to enjoy the music without embarrassing dd?  At the Pink Floyd concert 18 months ago, I totally rocked out.  But the crowd was all my age, so it was okay.  Here I was the bald mom.  So I did a slight head bob and didn't participate in the hand gestures.  I guess I did okay because dd told me when we got into the car that she was more comfortable going to that concert with me than she would have been her original friend.  I did good!!! BUT-my le arm was KILLING me (I tried resting it on my head a couple of times to drain it and was totally cussing myself out for forgetting my sleeve) and my ankles swelled up so badly that I literally hobbled out of the venue, but luckily the crowd was moving in that \"herd\" way, so no one really noticed but me.  When I got into my bed at 1am (!) I was the happiest soul ever!  Now I can cross \"attend a rap concert\" off my bucket list!  ;) Sheshe-sounds like you're starting off on the right foot with the rads thang-shopping afterwards!  I was surprised that you're snapped to your table.  I'm just laying there with all of these form things to hold my head/arm and have to be very still.  I think I like it better as being restrained would rub my claustrophobia tendencies the wrong way.  Hang in there. Paula-WOW on the nomination!  I know you're hesitant about the photo (it sucks to have pictures taken when we're not feeling so confident about our looks), but smile away.  You've proven to be quite the covergirl in the pix you've been posting here. Man, Carol, I can't believe the number of folks you're running in to with cancer.  Maybe it's because we have cancer that we notice so many others with the dx, but I agree with you-this cancer family is getting WAY too big. LWDana-my boob stings all the time.  To be honest, I haven't asked anyone about it.  I just figure I've traumatized the poor thing and it deserves to sting.  Should we be asking about that?  So sorry about your dog.  I know mine is like another child and I would be such a worry-wort if she got sick or needed surgery. You're just now figuring out that Jason is a hottie, Julie???  Bet you're wondering where you've been... Sorry about your bout with Motha Nature, Tinalee.  I've been watching your weather and feeling a little guilty when it's almost 80 here.  Today is only 60, though, and it feels colder.  Does that help?  (Have you heard of local boy, Atmosphere?) Therese-thanks for the info on future scans.  I'm sure I'll be a real PITA when I'm done with all my tx, what with demanding MRIs and whatnot.  I'll try to keep my cool.  And what a great report on your 5K!  It sounds like it was a great experience and so exciting for you to participate when you know you're truly a survivor!  I'll toss my pink cap into the sky for you! Oh, Carol, you remind me-tornado update:  it was way south of us, so no ill-effects here.  Thanks for the concern everyone. Hope your fog is mild, WVgirl. SIS Kimberly-yeah, I totally understand how you feel about not wanting to call and make appointments.  I actually waited 24 hours to make my calls for the same reason you want to give it a rest.  We all know you'll make the calls eventually, because the longer you wait, the longer it will be till completion day. KathyL-Congrats on all your med issues heading in the right direction!!  You must be so relieved!  (Half-deaf, too?  You probably would've been a better choice for the concert-my ears are still ringing today!) Okay, just LOL at the image of SIS Kimberly being \"poked in the port.\"  Thanks, Carol. Oh, and excuuuuuuse me, Miss Carol.  I was totally in a thinking about myself moment when I called you this a.m.  Totally slipped my mind that you had tx today and this was the day ds was going along.  Mea culpas all around.  Hope its going well for you (and ds). Man, Julie, I can't believe your misfortune with the whole migraine scene.  Hope you're feeling better and were able to get to the track meet. Good luck with your port removal tomorrow, Tinalee.  I hope they can help you with that scar, too.  I hate all the things that are different about my body (oh, got another tattoo yesty during my sim-I'm just lovin' all the spots on my boob!). Carol-You tell Steph I howled when I spotted the olives!!!!!! SIS Kimberly-I still tuck my \"hair\" behind my ears before Qtipping.  I can totally relate to pushing your \"bangs\" out of the way.  :) Deb-glad you're lurking.  Yeah, that taxotere is a bitch.  I'm sorry you're having so many se's, particularly after your rough go with the first chemotini.  That's just not fair.  Even though it takes time-you WILL bounce back.  And that 10 years you've put on?  It will be erased (and more, I think).  Your mental load will lighten and everything about you will bounce back.  It will take a while, so don't be impatient.  I didn't realize how much time it would take and have suffered some disappointments because of that.  But keep smiling.  Really.  As for crying?  My first cry was the weekend before my last chemo tx.  And it was a wimpy one, as far as cathartic cries go.  Some of us need tears and some do not.  Crying, not crying, it's all okay.  This is YOUR journey, so do what you need for your own emotional well-being.  We're here to hold you, console you, and help you up (as best we can in cyber-space), so you can always come here to ease your pain.  You're our sister.  (Just read SIS Kimberly's shout to you-if only I were so eloquent!  I second her comments.) Oh my, that was a long one.  Are you guys still reading???? D1",

Tinalee-ah, yes, Prince, another Minnesota product.  Be sure to tell your ds that your 50 year old Jewel Sister went to an Atmosphere concert.  I still can't believe I did it.  And enjoyed it.  Imagine that.  Didn't get a port, so I'm not familiar with the nasty scars you and KathyL talk about.  But if you're not happy with it, keep asking questions.  (Or, I can send you my tattoos-which I don't much like-and maybe you could work up some sort of bodyart.)  Ummmm.  Chili sounds good... KathyL-way to go on getting to the new job today!!  It must make you happy to get back to a professional life.  I couldn't believe that Tom, Derek and Shannon were having a conversation about their \"partnership\" on live TV.  You KNOW they're tangoing off camera!  My take?  It'll continue till she gets a new movie and he gets a new dancing partner. And you have a 5 o'clock shadow already???!!  Good for you!!  I'm jealous.  I think hair regrowth for a gray-haired being is less fun.  I just moved my hair appointment back another two weeks today.  Hopefully it'll start growing one of these days... Carol-they're not totally new, but if you like rock/pop, try Dashboard Confessional, Jack's Mannequin, Something Corporate, Death Cab for Cutie, or The Shins.  If you're more emo, I really like Brand New (their song, \"Jesus Christ\" was on my chemo playlist).  One of my favorite Atmosphere songs is \"Trying to Find a Balance.\"  What about Counting Crows-\"A Long December\" is another of my favs.  More recent rock that's fun is Kings of Leon or Modest Mouse.  Into folk?  Try The Weepies.  That should get you started. Ds really is a \"darling son.\"  You're really lucky.  Okay, I have to admit, college girl got her first tattoo at 16.  A star not far from her pelvic bone.  When she wears those low cut jeans, you can see it.  She liked it so much that she had two smaller stars added later.  These were black ink and did not mention her parents.  I don't have a problem with a tattoo that won't show when they're dressed for work (till they're old enough to sign for their own damn tattoos).  But he may want to talk to some men about having the breast cancer ribbon permanently etched into his skin.  It's a big part of his life now, but hopefully, with time, it won't be.  Perhaps he could come up with some design that would signify your family struggle with bc, but isn't quickly identifiable with bc and could portray overcoming any hardship down the road.  Not sure what that would be for him, and I'd hate to start making suggestions as I don't want to lead him somewhere he doesn't want to go.  But maybe there is some symbol that would represent his feelings about bc that would be more generic.  I just don't want him to regret a pink tattoo with \"mom\" on it in 5-10 years.  Maybe he wouldn't, but he really needs to explore that more.  Otherwise, I'm good with discreet, appropriate tattooing for a 16-year-old.  (Although I can't figure out why they do it...)  (Oh, and take my thoughts with a grain of salt-I was at a rap concert last night!) Ima go watch some TV tonight.  Lata. D1",

Today has been blessedly uneventful.  Although at rads today the techs were tsk-tsking over the condition of my skin.  My skin is getting that sandpapery feel like its going to peel, big time, and my nipple is covered with a bunch of blisters.  But I'm still wearing my compression garment till I can't stand it anymore (usually about 5p).  I still think I'm holding up pretty well and the techs did say they've seen worse...  (Hang in there, Frankenboob!) I agree with Carol, Julie, competing \"up\" is a double-edged sword.  My dd has always competed up in bball and I think it has robbed her of the chance to develop leadership on the court because she was always deferring to the older girls.  It's nice to see her be the older one for the first time this Spring on her AAU team and she's really trying to add leadership to her toolkit.  Sometimes it's working for her, sometimes not.  The interesting thing about it is watching her struggle with how to bring the team together (she's not really the cheerleader type).  She'll get it.  But too bad it had to wait so long.  Hope ds is able to cream all the good parts of playing up off the top. PALady-WOW!  Only 5 left?!  How many did you do?  I get a total of 30 zaps (last 5 are boosts).  I'm so glad your skin is holding up.  I feel like mine is really limping toward the finish line.  Just typing this makes me want to run upstairs and put on my cream. Carol-I really liked KathyL's suggestion about the tattoo research.  Wish I'd thought of that for my girl.  At least that way he'd know what he's getting in to.  You may want to add \"what if I get tired of my tattoo and want it removed\" to the research questions. KathyL-Right on!  I totally agree with your take on AI.  My only minor correction is about Jason.  Sure, he looks like he'd rather roll up a j sometimes, but I like his goofy, aw-shucks manner.  Besides, isn't there something kinda verboten about guys with dreds?  I think that (plus his eyes and guitar) are part of the appeal.  Frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't make it to the final-I'll bet there are hoards of young women fantasizing about him!  (But if David C doesn't win the whole thing-I'll be shocked and disappointed.  I know I'd download him.) Glad you like the music, Carol.  In all honesty, I like pretty much everything except opera and heavy metal.  If you chose any Shins or Brand New music, be sure to tell the ds.  He'll think you're over the top cool. SIS Kimberly-I happen to think a bit of cynicism is good for all of us.  It makes us ask questions and probe for straight answers (or at least answers that appear straight to us in the moment).  Stay cynical. LOL at you cleaning up your apple release on sausage feet, LJ (although I know the sausages are a relatively new development, it just adds to the image).  I do think we need to get \"it\" out, and I'm glad to see you found a way to manage that.  Perhaps try something less messy next time... How ya doin' Maz? Okay, caught up.  Maybe I'll kick back to a little Atmosphere on the iTunes! D1",

Today was my first radiation boost.  My new tattoo is a hair above my lumpectomy incision, but my tumor bed was about an inch and a half higher than my incision (my surgeon wanted me to be able to wear v-necked things).  I was concerned that they were giving my boosts to my incision, thinking my tumor bed was directly beneath that and I didn't want them to miss the target.  In what I thought was a rather tactful manner, I asked about it.  Turns out, the boosts actually radiate about a 3-4 inch circle.  So the point is to hit the tumor bed and surrounding area.  Ohhhhhh. Okay.  The procedure.  For me, they attached a contraption to the face of the rad machine.  They are able to insert about 3-4 plates into this contraption that will change the rad beam to the way they need it.  At the bottom of the contraption was a silver plate with a 3-4\" hole in it (this is the size of the boost field).  They position the hole over the area to receive the boost and zap away.  My body position on the table was different than my other tanning sessions.  I lie on the table with my head turned away from my \"bad\" side and lift my bad arm to rest straight up from my shoulder and then bend at the elbow so it cradles my head.  Then I hold on to some bar to keep it still.  My arm was a lot more comfortable.  They are only zapping me in one spot (not 2 like before) and the length of the zap appears to be 25 seconds (before I got one 15 second and one 25 second zap).  Hey, by the time I get used to this, it'll be over! How ya doin' on your own, Carol?  My dh is in Portland, OR yesty and comes home around 1am tonight.  One of these days I'll have to travel with him-but only if he stays long enough for us to have fun! Glad you enjoyed your crab legs, Julie!  I haven't had any of those in ages.  Around here we get the little bluefin crabs, which are delicious, but a lot more work than king crab.  Hope the slackards got their info to you today so you could finish your requests. KathyL-I stopped by Babies R Us on my way home from the gym today.  I really felt like a fish out of water in there!  I didn't find the brand you recommended, but I settled on another gel pad that I'm hoping will do the trick.  I'm not trying it today as I COULD NOT put my compression garment on today.  No way, no how.  It's rubbing my burned armpit totally raw and I just decided I needed a break.  So I'm wearing my Ipex bra (I think you were the one who wears those, too), instead.  I'm a little peeved at my choice, because at rads today, they drew all over me and asked me not to wash it off.  Of course, that means it wears off on my clothes because my skin just doesn't hold on to marker well.  I've got my shoulderpad stuck in my bra to try to protect it, but I'm thinking I'm going to have permanent ink on this thing...  Thinking of you at your new job today.  Fingers are crossed that its just what you need. The trail looks beautiful, Carol.  I'd want to take my training walks there, too.  I'm glad you were able to recognize Ginny when you guys met up.  I always have a little panicky feeling in the back of my mind when I'm seeing someone I haven't seen in a while that I won't recognize them.  I always breathe a sigh of relief when I realize my fears were unfounded. Your getaway cation sounds fabulous, SIS Kimberly.  I really like that part of the world and haven't visited in so long.  You and dh deserve some time to enjoy each other w/o the background noise of things medical.  When are you going? Thinking about Vettesis today... D1",

Speaking of SIS Kimberly, you should feel like you can take a break when you go on your cation.  Leave bc behind.  We'll be here when you get back and you won't be required to catch up on the shout outs.  (Truth be told-that will be my approach.)  Stay in some cozy inn with your dh and forget everything else. Sounds like a busy day for our KathyL today (and getting some exercise in on the walk from the parking lot-good use of time!).  Hope the new job is just the ticket. Joan-You'll not even notice that you've been to your tanning sessions this Friday, so plan on a kick-ass celebration with your friends.  You and I will both be celebrating!  I, too, headed over to the rads boards to see what's up, but I decided just to be a lurker there.  I have a feeling there will be Jewels hanging out here for some time to come and we can move through all of the steps of tx together.  But you do what's best for you, just remember-once a Jewel, always a Jewel! You know, Carol, I'm totally convinced that exercise plays a huge role in our recovery.  I KNOW my rads experience would've been less pleasant without consistent exercise.  My nurse even says so.  I have lots more energy (and I think it's waning) than the other rads patients and some of them have had fewer zaps than I.  So, keep exercising and all you other Jewels out there-take note and get on your FEET!  Ummmmmm, Dungeness crab... Glad you like the tunes.  I keep my iPod on shuffle, too, and sometimes find that I have to skip a song that just doesn't fit (like Christmas after Tupac-Whew!).  Oh, isn't that Dear Mama song great?  I always think he's singing to me and it makes me feel so appreciated. So, Paula, you start tanning tomorrow, too, eh?  Don't forget your sunglasses!  Oh, and I take my after-tan lotion and Tom's of Maine deodorant with me to my sessions and apply both afterwards.  You'll find you don't want to go a minute longer than necessary without your after-tan lotion as you progress through your tx.  (Hope you're still reading, Joan.)  And can I have your surgical oncologist, Paula?  I like how he sounds. Its next week for your surgery, then, Julie.  Probably better for you so you can shake the migraine before you get going on that.  I hope you're doing better by now. Hey, one more \"pal\" question (I had a ball last night trying to come up with ideas for her!), are there spending guidelines?  Last thing we need around here is that \"funny\" feeling money can give you when you're with friends.  Maybe a range limit for the total time we have each pal?  (Not sure, like I said yesty, I've never done something like this before.) So CathyCA, imbibing for the last time today.  Bottoms up, girlfriend.  And sincere congrats on making it to the end of this part of the journey. Good luck tomorrow to Carol, Wendy and CHJ (last one for her-HOORAY!!!).  FUBC!!! D1",

Been thinking about Julie all day long.  I hope everything's going okay.  It'll be a long wait for her report since they're keeping her overnight... KathyL-Sounds like you're coming around really quickly.  Although the ear thing would make me crazy.  Hope when you call the doc, you'll get some relief.  My nails are still a mess (my sister said they were \"scary.\").  Good thing I have polish on my toes and don't have to look at them every day.  Eyebrows, leg, pit and pubic hair are coming in rapidly.  Eyelashes are totally non-existent on the lower lid (well, I think I may have 5 on each eye-sad when you can actually count them), and show no signs of coming back.  Hair on the head is very slow.  I'm going to keep my hair appointment on Friday to see if there's anything that can be done about it.  Maybe if we can color it, it would show... I got a gift from my SP today, it had a wine theme, too (it's a book filled with info to help me enjoy the wine experience)!  I think either SIS Kimberly is having an effect on all of us, or all the wine conversations we've had around here have given the SPs some ideas... Oh yeah, Carol, a chemo holiday!!  You deserve it. That was such a \"good eggy\" thing to take pizza to the ds's partner after his fall. LWDana-I'm with you-what IS normal???? Urgh.  The appointment switcheroo is so frustrating, isn't it, SIS Kimberly?  Good thing none of us has a life that interferes!   I'll be interested to hear what they recommend you do and why.  I also want to hear what you plan to do with the information. I got a certificate to a spa for Valentine's Day this year.  Dh thought I'd want a massage when I finished all of this, but I can't have a regular massage for a couple of years because of the le.  So I thought I'd look into aroma therapy, but maybe I'll have enough for a facial, too.  I'll have to check. Wistful moments.  Yeah, LJ13, I know what you mean.  At first they're hard, but then you have to refocus and remember that the reason you feel wistful is because at one time you were in the thick of the activity and got so much pleasure from it.  Then you can turn your attention to the good memories.  And I don't think cancer necessarily will preclude us from participating in the things we love.  I think sometimes it's more just the passage of time that makes us move on.  But the good news is that by moving on, we make ourselves available to new experiences.  So, as Vettegal would say, \"it's all good.\" Congrats to Sheebas for the last tx today!!!  And I hope everything went okay for Wendy in the lounge. Tomorrow is Deb's big day.  Last one, Deb!!!  FUBC!!!! D1",

I did get into my backyard today and finish planting the flowers I bought.  Like Tina and Carol, I spend WAY too much on annuals, but I'm a such a sucker for some of them.  I still have some weeding to do and really, really need to mulch, but all in good time. It is Monday, and our girl, Carol is pumping up those counts to get her show back on the road.  Here's hoping you'll be imbibing today, Carol!!! LJ, I don't think I'm quite Annie Lennox status, yet.  I certainly have the light color, though!  My dh thinks I should get it colored with a rinse out color again so you can see my hair.  Apparently, I'd gone almost completely gray over the past 10 years that I've been coloring my hair and we're all pretty shocked to see it in it's natural state.  It makes me feel old.  :( How are you doing post-surgery?  Hope you're recuperating quickly and without hitch. Geez, Carol, you're training like a son of a gun!!  Good for you.  And what wonderful news to have your \u2018tini validated!!!  Chin up now, okay?  No more doubting your choices.  Clearly, you made good ones.  Relax and go hit the lounge. At least you've filled your prescription, Maz.  I haven't gotten that far.  Before I take my first pill I have to do a blood-letting for this study I've agreed to do-it allows me to put off the inevitable...  My eyebrows thinned to almost nothing and then, voila, a 5 o'clock eyebrow shadow appeared at about 10 weeks after my last tx.  It was none too soon as I found I was a horrible eyebrow draw-er on-er, so I was contemplating a hermit existence till they grew in, but alas, it wasn't necessary.  And that's just totally fucked up that you never lost your leg hair.  Joan, Frankenboob was in good shape 2 ½ weeks after the end of rads.  I'm just over 3 weeks now, and I still feel heat coming from my boost area.  I was told all should be well after 4 weeks.  I do still have energy issues in the late afternoon, and I'm not sure how long that will last.  Probably forever, since I'll be starting the tamox soon, and who knows what that will do to my energy level (sorry, there's my bad attitude about tamox showing through again). You know, you should be fine for your trip to Cali.  My rad onc told me to keep my \"field\" covered for about a year after rads, but I'm planning to hit the sun bathing as soon as I no longer feel heat from my boob.  I'll just use some sunscreen.  I'm sorry, but I like a tan (I'm not talking dark, I'm too fair for that, just some color).  I'm a product of the 70's, what can I say? Oooh, oooh, CathyCA made a great suggestion-I love the Hearst Castle!  It's egregiously tacky-almost like the castles in Europe!  You should see it if you're going by. Julie, you made me smile when I read about your day at the park.  I'm not a huge fan, but I love to go to the games-for some reason they make me feel like a kid again (albeit, one that can have a beer!).  Can't help you on the fill question.  I opted for my Frankenboob, rather than a new one.  Oh, just refreshed the screen and see that you're up and about today.  You sound happy-must be the girls' outing that gives you this new energy. Glad you made it to Duke okay, Paula.  I'm thinking of you and dh today.  I hope it all goes well for you. I don't know, Carol, could you \"butter your pancake????\"  ;) LWDana-I'm so very sorry to hear about LWBandit.  You should enjoy one another as much as you can now.  Take long walks.  Play a lot of catch.  Scratch behind the ears.  I really dread hearing similar news about my dog, but know you are/were a great human for Bandit to know.  How lucky you both were to know each other.  (And you wonder how you managed to \"touch\" that doc at your center???  Please.) Oh, in an example of universal alignment, the painter just called and had to postpone his start till Wednesday.  Guess my dh will get to enjoy the full experience, after all!  ;) D1",

I got the pill down.  Grabbed some yogurt and that did the trick.  You know, I think Joan's right.  We have to take these meds for such a long time and we're just ready to be done with it.  It makes the medicine harder to get down.  How many people have asked YOU if you're all done with tx?  People ask me all the time.  And I feel like, yeah, I'm done with surgery, chemo and rads, but I have to take a pill for 5-10 years that will have se's, so I'm not done till I take the last pill.  By the time I spin all of that out, whomever was being nice to ask has long ago rolled their eyes back in their heads in a moment of complete communication breakdown.  Know what I mean?  Maybe with time I'll consider myself done with tx, even though I'm still doing HT, but right now, it all seems to be part of my tx deal.  (Gosh I hope that made sense, this introspection stuff is difficult for me to articulate.) SISKimberly-I'm so glad you're bouncing back so quickly.  I know Thursday seems far away right now, but before you know it, the drains will be gone and you'll be in Victoria's Secret seeking out the best way to present your new girls!  You remind me that I need to schedule a gyn visit, too.  I want to get in there and be checked out nine ways to Sunday before the Tamoxifen gets all up in my body.  I think a baseline would be good (just me talking, no docs have urged this).  Oh, yeah, the asstonc knows about the Tamox-it puts me in one of their study \"groups\" being on it.  And she did confirm that I can stop taking it if I can't handle it.  Who knows, I might get lucky and lose that last 5 pounds that are giving me trouble while on it!  (It's not supposed to affect weight one way or the other, but my pharmacist said she hears of women losing weight on it all the time-maybe I'll get lucky.) Joan, your survivor's day sounds like fun.  And how wonderful to share it with your sister!  My fingers are crossed for that promised front of storms, too-I can't take much more of this oppressive heat! Oh, and ergggg.  I went in to make my appt with the rotator cuff therapist and she doesn't have an opening till July 1-so the waiting for relief continues...

My baby is 9 years old and we have never brushed her teeth.  The vet seems to think if we go ahead and do the cleaning now, we'll avoid extractions.  And SIS Kim, you're right, she is talking trash about us all over the neighborhood--but she has been for years since we use a watermelon scented baby shampoo to bathe her.  It gives her a decidedly un-doggy smell that surely embarrasses her in front of her canine companions.

The girls' dinner was such a hit last night.  Everything, including the ice cream cake, turned out perfectly.  Everyone was so happy.  The girls got up this morning and stamped hand and foot prints on a new t-shirt for dh, which hopefully will be dry for presentation tonight. It sounds like you had a very full weekend, Carol.  I'm so glad that you're enjoying more than just walking with Ginny.  (Wonder if she'd be willing to putter in my yard???) I think it's wonderful, KathyL, that you're able to share dd's recitals with so many people.  Those events always made me feel so warm inside.  (And I see you cooled off with Italian Ice, good choice!)  Of course you can join our book club!  I wish we all lived closer, too.  As always, thanks for the lounge list.  I cannot believe how short it's getting.  Hooray for the Jewels!!! Thanks for checking in Therese!  You really sound like you've got your hands full.  I'm so glad you're enjoying family and \"normalcy\" so much.  I'm sorry about your co-workers-2 more bc dx.  Ouch.  I hope they caught it early and will be celebrating life just like you in no time. The cation report was great, SIS Kimberly, thanks for taking the time.  I was lol at the vision of you stumbling around in the middle of the night, trying to find the bathroom!  Hope you got some good wines for your cork-popping appointment with our girl, Carol.  (I'm just green with envy.)  Yeah, our little Kippy is a schnoodle.  She actually looks more like a schnauzer than a poodle, until we let her coat grow out.  But all of her markings are schnauzer-like.  She really is a sweet little thing. OMG-I always thought it was \"electric boobs,\" too!!!!  How funny is that?  (Particularly given the fact that we met one another because of our own electric boobs!) And I sure hope you're right about my dream.  I'm hoping that I'm letting go of that and not predicting it's reprise... Oh, KathyL, Kimberly reminds me.  I was wondering the same thing about seeing a professional tat artist for some dimension on your nipple.  The tat shop here looks like a real dump on the outside, but is like a hospital on the inside (I've been there when I had to sign for college girl's first tattoo).  I'd be willing to bet money that they would be able to perk up (is that a bad choice of words, or what?) your tat.  You may even want to call your ps (or another, if you feel funny about calling yours) and ask if they would/could recommend someone to touch yours up.  Just a thought. And our book club grows-SIS Kimberly, of course you're welcome! Okay, off to check on the laundry... D1",

I read about your weekend, Jenn, and I couldn't keep up.  My head was spinning!  I hope you were able to recharge in the recliner today.  Your schedule leaves little room for you.  Try to build some in wherever you can. Three to go, Kris!!!  That's SO great!  Hang in there.  (I had awful mouthsores on Taxotere-Taxol's cousin drug.  Try rinsing with baking soda and water as many times a day as you can manage it.)  I know how you feel about needing to find a balance in your life, Carol.  I sometimes find that I cross my dh by sitting at the computer, all engrossed in whatever's going on here that day, ignoring him and his needs.  I suspect my cancer card doesn't carry the same weight around the house anymore, which is probably a good thing. (Yes, Carol, I had mouth sores...) Yeah, my drugged asshole got up this morning and I told him how he waxed eloquently about his nurse.  I told him he even liked her hair.  He said, ick, her hair was not pretty at all (over-processed straw is closer to the truth).  I guess I still like him. What a mom, Julie.  I would've done the same thing for my kids.  Way to go. Okay, Kathy, who would give it to the energizer bunny?  Have you looked at that thing?  Naw, I predict a drought for that creature, too. J My SP came through today, too.  A coffee mug that looks for all the world like the garden I wish I had and some lavender tea.  I may actually plant an herb in the mug and put it out where I'll see it every day.  It will make me smile.  Thanks SP! Speaking of my garden, I came up with a great idea for college girl.  I told her I'd pay her to weed all of my beds (with a bonus to be given if it's all done before she starts her internship on Monday).  She was out there today, going at it.  And every once in a while I'd hear a squeal that would curl your hair (if I had enough to curl).  Turns out she's afraid of worms!!!!  I NEVER knew that!  In a very wicked mom way, I lol every time she cut one loose!  I can be so naughty! It's 7p-I think I'll head to the fridge and pour me a glass of the wine I opened last night. Congrats to Wendy, who finished up today!!!!  FUBC, ladies! D1",

      "Content": "Jul 17, 2008 08:44AM Determined1 wrote: A quick check this morning before I get going on my jam-packed day.  The curtains are really nice, but they made a couple of mistakes on them.  For example, we have 5 windows in our breakfast nook and I had a roman shade made up for each of them.  Well, they sent me two different styles of roman shade for the same room!  Doh!  And the balloon valance in the adjacent room was supposed to have a 2 ½ inch thick board on the top and they only put a 1 incher.  I don't think these are biggies, but just another thing to follow up on for the to do list.  I really like the installer, though, so it will be nice to have him back to chat while he works (hey, am I supposed to tip that guy?  I didn't and then felt bad about it later.  And if I do tip, is it a percentage based on the total cost of the job?  They didn't break out the installation costs for me on my invoice.). So today I pick up my new sleeve.  I'm kinda excited about it as the old one really doesn't fit anymore.  It's also going to be the first time I've been in the shop that carries the sleeves and other garments (they've been coming to my rehab center with a travelling case of their goods, so far), so I plan to look around to see if there are any compression garment alternatives that float my boat.  (I've lost it-I'm actually excited to shop for compression gear...) Then tonight the family is going out for a nice dinner to celebrate the 26th anniversary.  No compression stuff for that-I'm going to wear something from my pre-bc wardrobe and cannot wait! So, what did I miss last night in my excitement over seeing LJ's hand?  (BTW, thanks Carol and LJ for the engraving hints.  Clearly you have the standard wording on your alerts since you both have the same thing.  I think I'll be getting that, too, just substitute \"left\" for \"right.\") Hey Carla, glad the surgery went okay.  Waiting for the path reports is not a fun time, I remember it clearly.  Try to keep yourself otherwise occupied as best you can.  A sympathetic OUCH on the drain removal.  But be happy you had the drains, I didn't and ended up with a nasty seroma.  Those drains do serve a good purpose.  When you go back in a month, do ask again about the sleeve.  They won't want to fit you till your swelling from surgery is down, but sometimes the docs forget about these things and we have to advocate for ourselves.  I don't remember about my arm being cold, but I will say not to let the docs dissuade you from identifying your se's-they don't know it all. Oh, KathyL, do I remember the bang grow-outs!  Headbands are a must.  I guess we'll be doing it soon enough ourselves!  Funny, our dehumidifier bit the dust this year, too.  Luckily, we realized it right away and we replaced it immediately, so we never had to worry about the mold thing.  We've replaced our carpeting in the basement twice in 14 years, though, so I guess it just wasn't our time to have to do it again.  I hope you guys can dodge that bullet.  So glad our Carol helped you get over the bad start to your day.  She IS amazing, isn't she? Speaking of Carol, thanks for the call and the ideas.  I tried (well, maybe not hard enough), but to no avail.  I'm going to keep it up, though, till I prevail (they don't call me D1 for nothing!). LWDana, try some black cohosh for the hot flashes.  It hasn't eliminated them for me, but they seem to be fewer and I'll take what I can get.  I'm still ripping my clothes off in bed (you'd think that would get me some action, but noooooo), but its better with the black cohosh than it was without it.  I've also heard that evening primrose can help, but I haven't tried that one.  Might be worth a shot. Okay, moving on.  Later. D1",

I'm just sad thinking about it.  Let me shake that off. Sherry, you're a good place to start.  First of all, smart move on flats.  You'll be standing a lot and will need to be comfortable.  You brought up something that crossed my mind when I saw the picture-that's that the pink in the stone on the shoe and the pink in your pearls will tie them together.  You may want to look for some earrings or bracelet with gold, too.  The pearls do need to be shortened up, but you already know that and I think you're dead on with the alteration to flatten out the bodice.  I LOVE the sheer layer over the dress-very nice.  Stick with your ensemble.  You are going to be a beautiful mother of the bride.  Sista-LOL on the \"yeah, I'm dying\" story!  Priceless!  You probably gave that poor clerk a heart attack! Oh man, Carol, bummer on the change in weekend plans.  Maybe the labor issue will straighten out sooner rather than later and dh will be home for some boat time.  (Or, if the ds returns from his victorious experience at Nationals-4th is EXCELLENT.  The competition at Nationals is like nowhere else.-you can let him drive the boat!)  ;) Good to hear from you, Tina.  Hope the sushi was yummy. Oh, you're so right about the metal tones and jewels this summer.  (How appropriate that jewels are \"in!\") Julie!  Finally a day out on your boat.  WooHoo!!!  I don't know much about beach vacations, since my dh doesn't much like the beach.  I hope others can come along with some suggestions.  Oh, and thanks for Carla's happy dance! I received a pm from a lurker recently (I won't mention her name in case she prefers the privacy, but I hope you're still lurking!), who alerted me to the fact that many oncs aren't particularly fond of black cohosh for hot flashes while on Tamoxifen because it's a photo-estrogen.  I did run it by my onc, just to be sure and he said that there is a lot of material out there on black cohosh and its effectiveness/counter-effectiveness while taking Tamox, so it's completely understandable that different oncs would have different opinions.  He said he encourages his patients to try things like black cohosh to see if they help with the hot flashes before pulling out things like Effexor  because of the se's on Effexor (did I spell that right?).  So, I'm okay on black cohosh, but LWDana, please check with your onc before taking it to make sure he/she is okay with it.  Thanks, unnamed lurker, for bringing that caution to my attention.  Feel free to jump in anytime, the more the merrier! Hmmm.  I need some more coffee.  Have a great weekend, Jewels! D1",

Wow, LWDana, that doc sounds like quite the piece of work.  Hang in there.  Sounds to me like he's going to get what's coming.  Good luck tomorrow. Carol, as I was reading your post, you came to the same conclusion as I about the Femara thread.  Those who have something about which to complain will be posting away diligently, while those cruising along will just cruise on with their lives.  Word to the wise, I got all bent out of shape reading about the horrors of Tamox on the threads and in all honesty, my experience has been okay.   I'm kinda excited as I stop taking Tamox tomorrow till the day after I return from cation.  That'll be just over a 3 week break.  I'm really interested to see how my body feels being off the drug.  (You'll remember I have to stop taking it because it can cause blood clots and my onc doesn't want me on long flights and to be taking Tamox, just in case.)  Anyway, enough about me, back to you.  I know we've had discussions about doing whatever we can to avoid recurrence, so talk to your docs about your reservations, get a full physical from your gp and tell him/her you're about to start on an AI and you want them to watch your body for se's and take it. You know, you can always stop taking the Femara if it's not floating your boat-this isn't the end of the line.  Hmmm.  I just talked to my mom for 2 hours (!) and I'm feeling wiped out.  Think I'll go mix up the spices with the chicken, grate the cheese, and make the salad so I'm ready to roll whenever my girls say they're hungry.

Where do you go in NC, KathyL?  One of my favorite vacations was the year we rented a house in Nags Head when the girls were really young (I want to say they were 2 and 4-they're 17 and 19 now!). My dx anniversary is August 17.  I actually found my lump the preceding January, but didn't do anything about it till May.  In June I had a needle core biopsy and was told it needed to come out, but we didn't know it was cancer, yet.  I put off surgery till after college girl's high school graduation and our vacation, so the period of time from discovery to dx for me was pretty long.  Are you going to do anything special to mark the day? Hey PALady, so you're doing the college search this year, too, huh?  I'm not sure I'm ready for the stress of it again already, but once we get this kid squared away, we're done with it, so there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I'm trying to get dd to take the ACT, too.  Unfortunately, it's not as popular here as it was in the Midwest when I was getting in to college, but I think it's a much better test than the SAT (which is just  an endurance test, imo).  You have tons of really nice smaller schools in PA (my college girl was determined to go to school in PA-she's at Dickinson College).  We looked at Allegheny, Muhlenberg, Gettysburg, LeHigh (the only place that rejected her), and she thought a lot about Bucknell, but in the end decided not to apply there.  In what schools is ds interested?  We'll have to compare notes and commiserate as we go through this. My mom's manuscript is a murder mystery set in China in the late 80's.  The crime is solved by a team of investigators from China and the US working in cooperation with one another at a time the two countries were just beginning to work together in limited fashion in the heavy industries.  My mom used to do consulting work between the US and China at that time, so she's drawing on her knowledge of customs from that period.  It's not a bad book this time around (last year was a much rougher read).  This time I'm mostly suggesting word changes and I'm going to try to convince her to move a few of the chapters around and introduce them differently, but we'll see how that goes.  It must be hard for her to have her kid read it and then criticize it.  I'm not sure I could do that. Most def follow up on the stomach pain-particularly since it went away when you skipped Tamox for a day.  I plan to surely make my onc a raving lunatic by the end of my 5-10 years of HT, since I'll be calling him for all sorts of things.  In fact, I've already called him to find out about flying and Tamox and to get the okay to take the black cohosh and Advil for headaches.  Let us know what gives. You guys make me smile about the packing comments.  It's funny, I can pack for two weeks in my wheeled carry-on and a backpack, but it takes the same amount of luggage for me to be gone for 2 days!  I've never figured that out. I'm a little nervous about our trip today, since I was listening to NPR this morning on my way to the gym and heard a story about two bombs that were set off in trash bins in Istanbul in a busy marketplace.  After the past year, I DO NOT want to become a terrorism stat.  I really hope we can manage not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time on this trip... Off to shower-I'm a bit stinky from my trek to the gym. D1",

I figured you weren't going to get off without the \"B\" word, LJ.  They actually go more quickly than the zaps you've been having, but the burning is more intense (reference Carol's recent experience).  The trick is the hydration, lubrication and exercise.  Also, set aside 30-45 minutes in the late afternoon to zone out-you'll find your energy will be better in the evening if you give in to the fatigue for a little while.  I used to just sit and veg in front of the tv or play computer solitaire (unfortunately, now I'm hooked on it).  You'll be great.  Oh, almost forgot-you should ask one of your docs to give you a script to see a physical therapist for the sore arm.  A couple of us have had rotator cuff issues and the rad positions are really hard on the arm.  Just get it checked out by a professional-can't hurt and maybe they can give you some stretching exercises to do to get things back to normal.  (Besides, you should have covered your deductible by now, so take advantage of our health care system, as shitty as it is!) So CathyCA is about to be an empty nester, huh?  I kinda dread that next fall.  The whole wonder years experience with my kids really seemed to fly by.  Glad you got the postcard.  I really wanted to send more of them, but didn't have as much time for that as I'd thought.  You would like Dubrovnik, though.  I wouldn't plan on more than 2 days to explore it-there isn't really that much to do.  But I think you mentioned that you'd be there as part of a cruise, right?  In that case, they'll take you off to several ports of call that will all be equally beautiful and amazing.  Do put the restaurant, Wanda, on your short list, though.  We had an excellent (albeit expensive) meal there. Yippy skippy Sherry!!!!  Good news on the scan results!  I think you're smart to see a le therapist.  You may find that all you need is a few weeks of MLD (and they should teach you how to do it to yourself.  Although I call my self-MLD fake massage because I'm really bad at it.).  Brush off your baggage about your drunken date.  Leave him in the corner at the wedding and kick your heels up in your beautiful mother of the bride outfit and shoes.  He'll be sorry he was such a jerk. Thank goodness you start school on Thursday, SIS Kimberly, and just have to make it through two days before you get a weekend break.  Kinda eases you in, doncha think?  Your energy will be back once you get back to the classroom, don't worry. Okay, so I was really stupid this morning and checked out a thread discussing hair and nail se's from Taxotere/Taxol.  It just pissed me off.  Particularly when I read about the woman whose toenails keep falling off and never recovered and she's three years out...  That's just totally fucked up. I think I'll go trim and file my nails now... D1",

I'm excited.  We've decided to do a little circuit for our college visits this weekend.  We'll drive on Sunday to CT and stay near Wesleyan and tour that school Monday morning.  Then we'll drive 2+ hours to Poughkeepsie so dd can show me around Vassar-no organized tour there as she's already done that.  But the good news about that is, maybe I'll get to meet Joan!!!  I sent her a pm to see if she can grab a coffee for 45 minutes or so (we have a schedule to keep, unfortunately).  I'm waiting to hear back from her.  After Vassar, we'll drive to the Philly area to spend the night and then tour Swarthmore Tuesday morning before heading back home Tuesday late afternoon. This driving, of course, follows on the heels of tomorrow's jaunt to PA to drop college girl off at Dickinson for the start of her sophomore year... Whew! I did not realize that with DCIS you could just have surgery and call it a day.  Why didn't I get that?  Seriously, I do feel badly for Christina Applegate.  She's so young.  Perhaps by being upfront about her situation, she can help some other women and that's always a good thing. Thanks for the encouragement on the empty nest, SIS Kimberly.  I suspect I'll handle it just fine, but I'm spending a little time now getting some of my mourning out of the way so I'm prepared for it. Julie-you make me want to rethink the whole getting back into the job market idea.  It sounds too tiring.  I wonder if I can find someone to pay me to stay retired???? Sorry you're nearing the end of cation, KathyL.  If you're getting the same kind of weather we have here, you guys picked a great week to be at the beach.  Enjoy the end of it and drive home safely. Ugh, I should go get my laundry underway.  College girl will be home from work in about 3 hours and will have to pack! Later. D1",

First of all, our college tours went great.  I can see why Vassar is #1 and was surprised/pleased to learn that Wesleyan has surpassed Pomona as #2 (it's closer to home, so as the mom that was good news).  It was a lot of driving this weekend, but it was all good.  We walked around Swarthmore (outside Philly) on the way home, but dd decided it wasn't her cup of tea.  Too bad, it's REALLY close to home.  Oh well. So I got to meet Joan.  It was sublime.  She was kind enough to suggest an easy to find place in Poughkeepsie and dh and dd dropped me off.  Joan and Lucy (OMG, you guys that dog is SOOO cute), met me for a couple of drinks.  We chatted pretty much non-stop.   It was really nice to flush her story out a little more than we've been able to do on the thread.  It gave me an even better connection with her.  She was then such a champ that she gave me a lift to dh and dd.  I have one photo on dd's camera and I know Joan has a couple (including a very good one with Lucy), that one of us will post soon.  It really makes me want to meet other Jewels-the in person hugs are the best ever!!!! So, on to my comments. Kris-dark hairs?  Oh man, those have got to go.  Yep, and the hot flashes totally suck.  (Good luck with the port removal.  Let us know how it goes.) Carol, great pix from your stay with SIS Kimberly.  Joan mentioned that there were some new shots on the thread when I saw her, but I'm just getting back to my computer to see them tonight.  You guys look great. The housing plan for ds sounds good.  It will help both your and his dad stay in touch with him while he does his \"separation years.\"  (They suck, but you'll all survive it.) SIS Kimberly-did you get all the grape juice off your cuticles, yet?  It's fun to follow your winemaking along.  Keep posting about it.  We tried our hand at brewing beer about 20 years ago and were pretty good at it, but when the girls came along we abandoned all of those pursuits that took so much time (that includes golfing...).  Maybe we'll be able to pick them up again real soon.  College girl was so funny.  She let us help with some things, but wanted to do others on her own.  It all worked out and she's requested that we drive up this long weekend and take her to dinner (like we haven't driven enough this weekend.  We figured out that since Saturday, when we took her back to school, we've put 1000 miles on the car.  And how much does gas cost?????) Dh didn't recognize Tom's name.  How coinky dinky that he lives in Arlington!  And yeah, you most def have me to visit when you come here, girlfriend! So glad to hear the pancake is just tanned now, Carol.  The body really is amazing, isn't it?  Rads for tongue cancer would suck, I hope your friend's son does okay with it. How did ds react to chatting with a professional?  College girl has had her issues growing up and spent the better part of high school in therapy (some time I'll tell you all about that-they were some tough times.  The good news is that she seems to be well-adjusted now and her future is very, very bright.)  It will probably help him to get back in to the routine of school, even though the kids claim to hate the homework, I think they thrive on the routiness of it all.  (Is routiness a word?) Julie-Wow, the house selling is becoming a reality.  I hope it goes well for you.  (I really don't envy you though, moving is one of my top most hated activities).  You're smart to take it easy with your new girls.  I'm glad you're able to use your sister as an example of how not to behave.  Sometimes we really can learn from others, huh? Hip hooray to ds on the football outcome!!! Carol-just reading that ds is thinking therapy is not needed now.  Keep it in your bag of tricks.  There's nothing wrong with giving it a try.  Just remember that finding the right fit with a therapist can be tricky, so don't get discouraged. Blood test in 6 months is a great idea.  Best to be safe than sorry. Oh, and I am not surprised to hear that you're healing quickly from rads.  I'm totally convinced of the healing power of exercise. Hey, Joan got the Zometa infusion, too.   She said she was a little achey for a day or so afterward, but nothing to really complain about.  And her attitude seemed to be if it helped her avoid bone loss, then it was a good thing.  I hope she'll weigh in on this and let you know what happened to her. Why do I let you crack me up so much LJ?  And it's always when you say so little... Glad the boosts are going okay.  I've been thinking about you. So SIS Kimberly had her first day with kids.  How'd it go? CathyCA-sounds like your driving trip was more restful than ours.  It seems New Yorkers don't stop driving, no matter what (and driving poorly, I might add).  Ooops.  No offense to Joan.  I meant the New Yorkers around NYC, not normal New Yorkers... Glad your ds is adjusting to college okay.  It can sometimes be a big change in a young person's life. Good to hear the prelim report on the wedding, Sherry.  I think you'll always remember that you mopped the floor on your dd's wedding day.  (Sounds like a case of the jitters to me.)  Smile at you dancing the night away.  I hope you'll have some pix to share soon. I ask for photos and, BAM, there they were.  (I wish everything went that easily in my life...).  They're great, Sherry.  Thanks so much for sharing them.  You looked awesome (\u2018course, I was hard-pressed to find someone in those pictures that didn't).  I wish many, many years of happiness for your daughter and your new son-in-law. Okay, that catches me up for now. Thinking of you all. Onward through the fog! D1",

Carol, nice chat last night.  Again, my apologies to dh and ds for horning in on their family time with you, but I couldn't help myself.  I'm still LOL while I imagine you at the Lovers store this afternoon.  ;) We'll be here this weekend, SIS Kimberly, not to worry!  Teach those children well!  (Hooray on finishing p/t.  Looks like I'll be going for another 2 months at least.  We got as far as we could for now and have switched gears to work on breaking down some of my massive scar tissue so I can get more mobility.  I can tell you, this part HURTS.) Oh Sherry, just reading about your gf and her lump.  Fingers are crossed that it comes back benign. Of course you deserve to be paid more for your job!  That's the American way, isn't it?  (We're underpaid and overworked??)  Try a glass of wine with the heating pad to see if that relaxes your muscles any.  (Not promoting alcoholism or anything, but we all deserve to kick back a little.)

Carol-great news on your friend and her baby.  I cannot imagine how it must feel to deliver anything but healthy, pink bundle of joy.  My heart really goes out to her and her husband.  You will be SO ready for your 3-day.  I'm so proud of you.  It's been fun to follow you along as you train and then decorate (!) for this event.  Don't forget your iPod!  Oh, um, if I can wear my big girl panties and get poked every 3 months, then so can you.  Nuff said. Push for the MRI this time.  As I recall, you don't have too much to smush around and I think that port placement could be an issue.  Talk to your onc about your concerns and hopefully, he'll hear you and request an MRI. You know, I wondered how you were faring while you waited for your freckle results.  I didn't want to suggest to you that you should be concerned, so I didn't say anything, but I was certainly knotted on your behalf.  It's funny, I've never been much of one to worry till I had something to worry about, so this is a new feeling for me.  Perhaps I figure I actually do have something to worry about...  I hope this goes away with time. Hey Paula!  Good luck with your visits today.  Sounds like ds is doing interviews, too.  Hope he's able to relax.  My dd is applying to Vassar early decision and then will apply to either Wesleyan or Pomona early decision 2, if she is rejected by Vassar.  I think she'll apply to College of William and Mary under regular application.  Unfortunately, all of those schools are REALLY competitive.    We're really pushing her to find a couple of other schools to include in her regular decision apps that will certainly accept her (you know, the backup plan).  I would not be able to deal with her if she were completely shut out and then ended up at the community college because she didn't have a Plan B.  When we saw the college counselor on Thursday she looked up any past Vassar applicants and only found one.  That girl had a 4.0 going in to her junior year, my kid has a 3.88.  That girl's SAT scores were 650 in Math/720 Reading/740 Writing.  My kid's SAT scores are 640 Math/690 Reading/780 Writing.  That girl was wait-listed at Vassar and my kid isn't quite as good.  The counselor said that dd might be able to make up for her deficit by going out for basketball at Vassar, but that would mean we'd have to include her high school bball coach to get her help and you'll recall she let my kid sit on the bench her junior year after having been a player her sophomore season under a different coach.  So I don't know how much the coach will help.  In fact, we were content to not speak to the coach this last year and just let the chips fall where they may and walk away from high school sports.  Now we're going to have to ask for her help and I'm not sure how that will affect my kid's playing time for her senior year.  Why can't this be easier?  I really hate all the jockeying and game playing.  Ugh. Oh, and I have all kinds of problems with brain farts.  Like you, I find myself losing words or unable to pronounce them.  That better go away... I will say if they did a brain MRI on me, they'd discover all the rocks up there and it would explain a lot of things... Try some ice and rest for the swelling and see if it goes down.  If it's le, it won't go away so easily.  Most def bring it up on Tuesday.  (It's always sumthin, isn't it?) Let me know when you're going to be here.  I think it was sometime this month.  It will take me 20 minutes to get to the McLean Hilton.  I'd LOVE to meet another Jewel. Okay, got to wake dd up for work. Later, gang. D1",

I sure hope your classes work out, SIS Kimberly.  It must be a real pain to start the school year and then know there will be some changes.  It seems to me that you'll be starting over.  I'd find that very annoying. I sure wish one of us were a college admissions officer.  I think several of us could benefit from the insight this year.  We've talked about asking one of her AAU coaches to help dd with the basketball portion of applying to colleges.  We're not sure what that communicates, however.  Wouldn't it look awful that the high school coach wasn't involved? I think you're christening your ds' new bbq today.  Have a great time. Oh KathyL, I'm sorry you have to have your nipple completely redone.  The tat is one thing, but the whole shebang?  Ugh.  You seem to have a good attitude about it-that's the bigger part of the battle as we all know.  LOL at those 5 lb boobs!!! I was thinking about you, yesterday, too.  Hoping you were staying dry and safe.  Those hurricane rains are so weird, aren't they?  It's downright hot outside during the rain.  But today dawned absolutely beautiful and the air is so clear.  I love it.  Glad to hear we all weathered the storm.  (How'd it go for you, LJ/Joan/Maz?) Wow, Carol, you're all packed!  I cannot believe your walk is this coming weekend.  I'll keep fingers crossed for good weather.  I know you're probably already out on the links, but may I be the nagging voice of reason and suggest to you that you take it easy on your stitches while golfing?  You don't want to aggravate anything and then have some wound to deal with on your 3day.  Oh, and massages/pedis sound like the perfect way to unwind after 3 days in a tent (the whole porta potty thing makes my skin crawl...Silver lining-at least you won't have your period to deal with in the wild!). Hey, and thanks for the tunes.  There are a number on there that I don't already have and am very happy to get them.  You be studly. Oh, and I see you're switching from the Mariners to the Seahawks without missing a beat!  (Wonder why???)  I'll be in football mode tomorrow night when the Vikings kick off their season.  Should be more fun than baseball was!

I'm guessing that Julie must be feeling Ike about now.  What a storm!  I couldn't believe the pictures of Galveston.  It's hard for me to believe that anyone survived riding that baby out. Kris-thanks for the skinny on the razor thingy.  Let me know how your return growth looks-I'm still a little leery of shaving it off...  How's the foob search coming along? Oh Sherry, so sorry the back is still bugging you.  Hope you're getting some relief by now.  I went to your website and all I see is your \"donation thermometer.\"  Are there supposed to be pictures?  (I AM having some trouble with my connection today.) Wow, PALady, you really raised some dough!  I'm impressed.  No wonder you haven't had much time for the thread.  Unfortunately, I can't see your photo on my computer.  Not sure if it's related to my connection difficulties or not. LJ, you made me smile with the happy feet.  Let's hope Carol feels the same way after her 3day! Oh man, Julie, you've got it coming at you from all angles, don't cha?  I don't know how you stay so upbeat.  Hang in there.  You're welcome to vent anytime. Paula, of all people to know that cancer sucks!  Thanks for the good wishes for my sis.  I'm so looking forward to meeting you this weekend.  What's best, should I call you on Sunday, or do you want to call me (thinking maybe you'll be in sessions and I might interrupt)?  I'm flexible. Yeah, Therese, the guy that doesn't sing is Stuart.  They did a review of their most recent concert here in DC and they said he's really gotten good at the Eagles music.  I do know that he's pretty talented.  Wish I'd reached out to him more when our girls were going through school (they were classmates from K-12)-maybe he'd a given me some free tix!  Ewww.  Your fellow concert goers sound like they were disgusting. SIS Kimberly-3 pounds!  WooHoo, girlfriend!!!  Stick with it.  (Oh, and the gel inserts were a good suggestion for Sherry, wtg.) Also, what a great \"reveal\" gift you sent to me!!!  I KNEW you were my SP, but it was still a riot to get things from you every now and then.  I will cherish the glasses and drink from them every night and think of you.  Thanks. So, our first 3dayer has survived!!!  (Hope for you, CathyCA.)  Carol, you are amazing, girl.  I'm so happy to see you with that shit-eating grin in all the pics.  Sounds like the body held up.  Like everyone else here, I can't wait to hear all about it (but you guys go off for massages/pedis-you certainly earned them!).  (And you were straight up crazy to sleep in that tent.) I gotta walk my dog.  She hasn't been out, yet.  I'm such a bad mother. Later. D1",

MLD is manual lymph drainage.  It's a massage technique (envision an incredibly light touch, not what you normally associate with massage), that encourages your lymph fluid to drain to nodes that are working.  For me, that means draining up my left arm and down my left trunk to my groin or from my left side to the right side of my chest.  As soon as I can figure out a way to include the warming KY, I will, as the tube remains unopened, despite another aborted attempt on my part.  (At least dh acknowledged that I was trying the next morning and told me he was tired-I thought that was a girlie excuse-and that it wasn't for any nefarious reasons.  Quite frankly, we need to get this elephant out of the room and get on with life, but I'm kinda uncomfortable in this arena, so I'm not exactly going to hop on pop, iykwim).  Sooooo, maybe the KY can be used in the Flexitouch (you gotta love the name!)... KathyL-those are bona fide Virginia peanuts!  They're devine, aren't they?  I'm glad you guys are enjoying them.  (And I wasn't thinking about the pun, but maybe we're all a little nuts sometimes!) Thanks everyone, for the kind thoughts for my sister.  I have passed them on to her and she's really touched (not to mention amazed by the support network we have-too bad I can't find anything like us for Hodgkin's Lymphoma). I've started my fall project, which is to try to match the tile in our master shower and get the floor retiled (some of the tiles are cracked and yucky stuff is starting to grow), and then maybe splurge on a new showerhead (we need one to accommodate dh, who is 6'5\") and maybe even a new shower enclosure.  Then paint and reattach the mirror to the wall as it is starting to separate from the wall for some reason.  I went to my first tile store today and came out kinda disappointed.  I'll have to marshal my energy and try again.  I'm hoping by Christmas to have this project knocked out. Onward through the fog! D1",

You guys, she's as real as she posts.  We shared back stories and commiserated about college applications.  Then she was kind enough to slog through the pix on dd's camera from our cation (I inadvertently started a slide show of the memory on the camera!).  Hopefully, dd will download the pix of us so I can share with all of you (dd has added Colorado College and Lewis and Clark College to her list of schools, so she's busy with the apps for those two-she went for a bike ride today and decided that she needed to be somewhere where they were in to protecting the environment-I should never leave her alone...). Hope your visit to DC finished well, Paula!  Thanks for taking time out of your schedule to see me! Carol, why on earth would you clean your kid's room?  I try to ignore the fact that those areas exist.  If you can keep him to keep his nose clean, then you are a better mom than I.  I do think agreements are good.  And my dd just discovered shopping at Goodwill, so she'll be happy to see ds' stuff... How'd the Seahawks do?  Dh told me that the Vikes won today with Gus Frerotte (sp?) at QB.  Guess our coach decided his job was more important than sticking by his crappy QB.  Now I'm thinking that maybe I should not watch them play anymore this year as they won without my running commentary during today's game...  (I'm not superstitious or anything...) Okay, off to spend some time with my family. D1",

Joan--Good to hear from you.  Hope you continue to feel good and get your energy back.  We'll have a big celebration on May 9, won't we??! SIS Kimberly--Thanks for the encouragement on not getting Vista.  I always worry that I'm staying in the dark ages sometimes when I don't upgrade.  Oh, and no thanks for rubbing in the names of our brown nosers who have turned in their cards already! Kris--Another flasher?  The world is unsafe with so many HOT women!!! Carol--Oops.  Another col (cackle out loud) slipped out when I read about your gift.  And then I read your comment admitting what a sad day it is that you're so excited about its heavy base and tilting capacity that I col some more.  God, we are SO simple!  And another one validating my XP choice--thank you. College girl would make a good politician (likeable, chatty, charming), but my little one would be a better president (and no baggage for folks to rummage, yet!).  Maybe they could run together... Looking forward to the book.  Just about done with my first post-chemo read--Anne Tyler's \"Digging to America.\"  Well written piece of fiction (but I like Anne Tyler--she wrote \"An Accidental Tourist,\" which was WAY better than the movie). Julie--Hooray!!!  You got your feel good day!!! KathyL--And even more joining the stick-with-XP chorus.  I shoulda asked sooner, rather than agonizing over this. My fingernails are pretty sad.  Seven of them are \"white\" to at least the middle of the nail.  I'm hoping I don't catch one on something and bend it back, cuz that will be the end of it.  I'm hoping I can keep them short enough that they'll grow out.  I got a pedi yesty and when she removed the dark, winter polish color, you could see that several of my toenails are black.  I chose a spring color this time and even though it doesn't cover all of the black, I'm going with it.  Who's looking at my toes that carefully anyway? Oh, and my weight is being very stubborn.  I gained 13 pounds since my dx and have lost 2 in the last 7 weeks!  I'm going to keep plugging away, but we really don't eat that badly--its the alcohol that kills me.  But I can taste it again and I'm not giving it up without a fight! For those comparing eyebrows--mine are suddenly falling out like crazy.  Fortunately, I started this journey with really heavy eyebrows, but they're looking sparse to those who know me.  And I've lost a bunch from the inner corners, so that my browline begins about a 1/4 of an inch from its former location.  Of course, college girl has been on me for years to pluck out my unibrow wannabe, so maybe I just look normal now.  Leg hair is growing in dark--head hair is see-thru--go figure. Deb--I totally hear you on the impatience thing.  Part of the reason I started the January thread was because even though my 1st tx was December 27, I knew the December crew would finish before me and I could not handle the thought of being the last to finish.  Glad I felt that way because I met all of you.  So its easy for me to say \"be patient,\" but I know I wouldn't have been.  I want you to have energy NOW, too! Tinalee--I did like Austin.  But our start there wasn't so good.  My dh (then my boyfriend) and I drove our Plymouth Fury down there from MI (where we'd grown up).  When we first arrived in TX (this was in the mid-late 70's) the locals kept forcing us off the roads in our tank.  We couldn't figure it out.  Then we changed our plates to TX and all of a sudden, the forcing off the road ended.  They just didn't want some Michiganders infiltrating their gig!  Yes, the music was good (I actually developed a taste for country-western, didn't know there was a difference from country till then), but the food was to die for.  In fact, my whole agenda for my little family celebration is based on eating at certain places.  (That'll be good for my diet...) Oh, and if my college girl had been unable to get an internship on her own (I'm still amazed at that--its unbelieveably competitive to get those), my dh was going to hit up his old friend, Oberstar (from your neck of the woods) to see if she could intern with the Minnesota delegation (the dh lived in Forest Lake for a while and he and Oberstar have worked on transportation issues for a long time).  But, my kid is amazing all on her own.  I'm so proud. Yes, Jewels, Frankenstein left DWTS (I'm sorry, but if you get all that done to your face, you should look like Frankenstein.  Shows you money can't buy everything).  I was glad.  It made me uncomfortable to watch her.  And I agree with KathyL (I think) that the bootee on AI was improving, but let's face it, you knew her days were numbered.  I still don't see the hoopla around little David A.  He's a cutie, but his whispery voice annoys me.  I'm all about David C. and Jason (if only for the eyes and dreds--oh and the guitar).  (Okay, why am I still watching all of this reality tv?  I'm done with chemo.  Am I hooked?  Oh no!!!!  I'm even watching America's Next Top Model.  At least I don't watch Survivor or the Biggest Loser...) Guess I'll go see what reality tv I have tivo'd for tonight's enjoyment... D1 Yo, yo!  (Been listening to Randy too much on AI.)  I want to acknowledge Julie, Tinalee and AZDonna, all of whom spent their last hours in the lounge today.  Three cheers!!!!!  Also, a big shout to LJ13, who headed to the bar on this beautiful day in the mid-Atlantic.  Hey there LWDana and WVgirl--you two are up next!  FUBC!",

Grand Portage sounds like it must be beautiful.  Back in the 70's, when I was proving my manhood to my boyfriend (who is now my dh), we camped and hiked for a week in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.  So beautiful, but too much work.  I'm glad I did it, but it's not one of those things I'll ever do again.  (I'm also the one who isn't in to the 3-day because it includes camping...) You sounded really good yesterday.  I hope the se's are really, really teeny this time. Actually, LJ13, I think being a cancer survivor is going to make that onc an even better doctor.  I hope he/she has a swift and relatively uneventful journey with cancer. Glad you're lurking CHJ.  You're in the fog days now, hope it clears soon. Therese-It's interesting to read your hair reports.  I've been letting mine just grow in so far (I'm 8 weeks out from last tx this Wednesday).  Some of the hairs are over an inch long, but they're pathetically sparse and so white you can't see them (they're practically transparent).  I have a hair appointment for this Thursday (this is the one I've been moving back for a month now), but I think I'm going to push it back yet again.  First of all, it conflicts with my le massage (and now you all know I drool during that, so why would I want to miss it???), and secondly, I'm not sure I'm ready, yet.  I'd love to add some color, so I could see my hair, but I don't want the hair color to stain my scalp and make me look more stupid than I already do.  Oh bother. Waaaaahhhhhh!  I'm just reading that you live near Vassar, Joan!  It feels like I just missed meeting you by inches.  Maybe dd will end up there!  You won't believe this, while I was starting your shout out, dd called with the low down on her Vassar tour.  She LOVED the school.  It's now her #1 choice (she's been to Washington University at St. Louis, Pomona College, and Georgetown University so far.  She loved Pomona, too, but thinks CA is too far away for a VA girl).  My dd is really into writing and apparently Vassar has a strong English/Writing program.  So, who knows??? PALady-Yeah, my le arm is a hurtin' puppy from the rads position.  I stretch it out every day and give it the massages my legu taught me, but it's a real bitch.  I'm 16 down, 14 to go, so I'm just forging ahead.  After today's tanning session, I notice that I have a couple of areas that are really blotchy and itch like nobody's business.  I see babydoc tomorrow, so I'm going to ask what's up with that. Oh Patty, that's great news on Denise!!!  Hopefully now her med team will be able to put together a tx plan for her and get the show on the road.  (I remember how much it sucked while I was waiting to get my plan in place.  It's much easier to do the plan-even tho the se's can be nasty-than it is to formulate the plan.) Did you hear me honk at you, KathyL?  I tooted the horn as we passed into DE on our way to White Plains this weekend.  On the return trip, I was riding with one of my dd's teammates and her parents, so I honked to myself, but I was thinking about you!  Glad to hear your weekend was mundane-that's what we're all hoping will happen to all of us real soon.  Oh, and thanks so much for the tx list again.  You're the best! Carol-lol at the dermie discovering that you're missing a body part!  You're such a card. Good to hear from you from the fog, Julie.  Your attitude sounds great.  Keep it up.  (I'm composing this in Word-finally!  Sometimes you have to beat me over the head to get me to change my behavior!) Oh man, SIS Kimberly, this infection is your gift that keeps on giving, isn't it?  It sounds like you're a \"go\" for tomorrow's finale in the lounge-that's good news.  Also glad to hear you're going to get abx for a week after tx.  Hopefully, that'll keep you from having a tailspin this time around.  I'm pulling for \"soft\" all the way, here! You really outdid yourself this weekend, didn't you?  First, victory laps and celebrations all around for survivors (I can't wait to do something like that), and then lap dances (oops, I mean chair)!  The partay animal! Oh yeah, way to go on scoring the dessert.  We have to take advantage of the little perks of balditude whenever we can! Boy, I completely understand your emotional conflict over tomorrow.  When I was getting prepared for my last tx I had the worst attitude ever!  Then I worked myself over and by tx day was ready to roll, but it was a real struggle.  I was totally into the putting one foot in front of the other just to get through it.  Just grab your cape and glass, girlfriend, I know you can fly right through this one!  FUBC!!!! Just bring your beautiful smile to the pic, KathyL.  I do hear you on the challenged follicles and how it sucks that your ID badge will bear that image for a while, but I saw a picture of you in your balditude and I think you're beautiful.  When you smile, think of that. Hmmm.  Guess I should go see if my dog needs to get outside.  Seems there's a break in the rain and she must be in agony by now. Later. D1",

LWDana-it's so good to hear from you.  I'm so sorry to hear about your father's death.  I guess I didn't realize he was battling cancer, too.  I'll bet it made him a lot more comfortable to know his daughter was caring for him.  And you gotta know, he was/is so proud of your accomplishment, even though he couldn't celebrate the way he would have liked.  Enjoy your cruise and know it was his gift to you to cherish.  I'm confident that you will find a job that suits you-you seem to have a great deal of compassion.  Hang in there-and I, too, like the sound of your tumors stagnating.  You're going to come out of this a stronger person (if that's possible).  ;) CHJ, what a great testimonial from your co-worker on the election.  It really puts it in perspective, doesn't it?  Hope the colonoscopy went well today and you got a humongo ham sandwich to celebrate! Wow, Therese!  Your recon is complete!  I'll bet you thought the day would never come.  Congratulations!  You know, it's funny, part of the reason I've been stalling on keeping the short hair is because I'm not ready to look like my mom, either.  My hairdresser said she'd like me to grow it out a little more, but keep it short.  She keeps saying she wants to try something edgy with me.  I guess \"edgy\" doesn't sound like my mom's hair... Have a safe trip, Carol.  Don't sweat the small plane too much.  Both of my parents were pilots and we only flew the little ones.  Sometimes I feel more secure in those planes.  The bloody mary should help, but don't have too many.  When my sisters and I were leaving the Bahamas last week we had a 2 ½ hour layover in Nassau and had some money left in our kitty (we pooled our money for the week to minimize arguments over finances).  Well, we decided to drink the kitty dry.  So we each ordered up a couple of yellow birds (that's the banana rum drink).  Next thing you know, we hear our names over the loudspeaker that they were closing the door to our flight and were \"last calling\" us!  We freaked out!  And then completely stumbled to the plane.  I think I'm still nursing that hangover! I agree with you, KathyL, I think Beau Biden could have a good career in government service.  I hope he gets the nod. Oh my, Sherry, take a deep breath and exhale slowly.  I hear there's a lot on your plate and it sounds like it's completely stressing you out.  Make yourself a list and triage it.  Only do what you can do without stroking out and let the rest of it go (oh, and send this same message to me when I start freaking).  It's all good.  Enjoy Brandy and her pals. I should get back to my laundry and walk the dog before I start primping for my black tie affair tonight.  At least it shouldn't take me long to do my hair!!!! Onward. D1",

Today I seem to have an \"eat\" going.  I'm trying not to snack, but my mouth really wants stuff!  I find it annoying as I'm still 6 pounds away from my goal (although I'm about to kiss off two of those pounds and revise my goal-I just know if I do that, though, it will be the beginning of the end...).  Maybe if I spend some time with you all, my mastication phase will pass. So I got some pix from my sister to post.  My sisters are identical twins, although they don't look much alike to me.  The one with the shorter hair was the one who had Hodgkin's Lymphoma 3 years ago.  She now has a new lump (I told you all about that) that her doc's have changed their minds on and will have to have it removed around Thanksgiving time.  And because the news just keeps getting better, she had a bad mammo since we've been home and now has to figure out what's next with that (this on top of the bad thyroid that hasn't been managed, yet).  She had to turn around and head out on a business trip the day after we returned from Eleuthera, so she hasn't had a chance to do anything about her health.  Ugh, Debbie Downer.  So here are the pix:  This one is the three of us at a beach we used to frequent as kids.  The little island in the background on the left hosted our snorkeling forays many, many times.  Here we are, drinking the Kitty dry in the Nassau airport.  Those are Yellow Birds we're enjoying!  Finally, I had to post one that proved we actually did some work!  We sorted many shelves of books and then my librarian sis had us color code them so the patrons would know what to expect from the books.  We also made circ cards and envelopes for the cards in the back of each book.  This is just one case of books, there were a total of 3 cases we finished up in this particular library (all of the children's collection). So, other than LJ giving me shit for my blood pressure and single-handedly driving our economy, what's up? Julie, taking the house off the market right now is probably a smart move.  You won't get your value back in this economy.  Join me in the renovation revolution!  (I'm redoing a bathroom.)  We can commiserate online... Geez, Carol, everything's just aching to test your emotional state, isn't it????  (At least it's the weekend!) A clean kitchen sounds like the best gift, ever, Carla!  Glad your girls came through for you. I can't believe you have time for a post, KathyL!  I hope the bday party goes better than the family celebration.  Get your dog a wheelchair!  (Seriously, I hope he's back to his old self soon.) Best birthday wishes to Paula and Ed!!!  I hope you have a grand celebration! Onward! D1",

Good news is that I popped my envelopes in the mail today! Dd's ankle is improving.  Still colorful, but turning the familiar purple/red/black color that means healing is near.  She did play in one game yesty (the last one was cancelled-one of the worst run tournaments I've ever seen!) and was hittin' the 3's!  She even shot one over a 6'3\" girl (my baby is only 5'9\") and brought the crowd to its feet.  Her assists were outstanding, too (she was the leading scorer and the second leading scorer made all of her points off dd's assists).  Wish she'd play like that all the time... Thinking of my fellow tanners, Vettegal and Sheshe.  Give a report when you have a chance. I remember hearing that quote from Hitch, KathyL!  (Loved that movie, too.)  It's actually a very good reminder to us, isn't it? Hope you enjoyed your private Saturday, Julie.  So glad to hear the headache subsided. You look amazing in the lounge, Paula.  And what a wonderful team you had!  Glad you got the truffles for them.  Oh yeah on using the balditude for ticket avoidance.  Good call.  Then to precede your fog with a productive outing at the ball field (way to go, ds!), you live right, girl.  May your fog be light. How was the golfing, yesterday, Golfer???  Hope you had great weather and an even better stroke.  (Hey, give an extra hug to your co-worker for me.) Bet you feel better after that rant, don'cha, LWDana?  Glad you feel safe enough to rant here.  I sure hope the Tamoxifen works for you.  Oh, and I worked out all through my chemo.  I found I had to take off about a week (not quite) after each infusion, but then worked out in between.  By the last two tx, I wasn't able to maintain my usual pace, but I did what I could.  It sure was the best medicine for my head. You won't believe this, Sheshe, but the two baseball teams I follow are the Tigers (can't get all of the Michigan out of me!) and the Nationals-the two worst teams in MLB!  (Oh, I think the Rangers are sucking eggs this year, too.)  I was glad to see the Tigers post a \"W,\" too.  Glad you're working out, too.  I'm convinced it's helping me keep up with the rads.  I am feeling much less energy (I'm not really sleepy, just listless), but I can still muster when I need it and then just kick back when I can.  So far, so good. Julie, your rudderlessness sounds reminiscent of what Therese wrote right after she finished chemo (I think she was \"all done\" after chemo, too).  Its kind of jarring to suddenly be cut loose after being tethered to our med teams for so long.  And for such an emotional journey.  I'm sure we'll all adjust to no longer having our days filled with things medical, but we have to give ourselves a chance to adjust.  That's what we're all going to help one another through next! Hey Paula, I'd like to read Wendi's book.  I'm about ½ way through Deanna Farve's read, so if you'd like to me to swap with you, I'm happy to do so.  I'll pm my address to you. Yes, FUBC, Maz.  Sounds like Val gave you a real gift-reuniting you with people you'd lost along the way.  Continue on to Wednesday with strength, you know Val is with you all the way. Well your day is just sucking, isn't it, my one-boobed, one-browed, mostly bald and half-looney friend?  Make sure all the firearms are unloaded and safely locked away! SIS Kimberly, I'm so glad to know you.  Thanks. D1 Good luck tomorrow, Kris!",

      "Content": "Nov 27, 2008 02:13PM Determined1 wrote: Happy Thanksgiving, Jewels!!! It's been a while since I've had a chance to check in and I've missed you guys.  This has been a crazy week for me.  We kicked off our Basketball Boosters season Monday night with a parents' meeting and I was overwhelmed preparing for it and now I'm swamped with a to do list as a result.  I'm trying to take a break from it today, since its Thanksgiving.  We'll see how well I do.  Our first night to open our snack bar (one of our activities) is Friday, Dec. 5 and it seems like there's a mountain of things to do before then.  Forgive me if I'm not around quite so much. Update on my sister.  She had her mammo redone on Monday and the docs at this center were not as impressed as the folks were who did her first one.  So she's been given a clean bill of health on the mammo for another year.  Then she trotted off to see an ENT surgeon about the growth on her neck.  They did a CT scan and the surgeon was equally unimpressed with that mass, but he didn't like a mass he spied on her thyroid.  (She's suspected there was something up with her thyroid for a long time, so she wasn't completely surprised.)  She's going to have that lump removed on December 4.  I'm hoping it will be benign.  She's already done the cancer thing a couple of years back and didn't like it much.  I'm not sure if she's up mentally for more of the same.  Keep your fingers crossed. My news is that my drought has ended!  I think my drought was a bit longer than most (we'd been having some issues long before bc came up), so it was especially nice (and so much like riding a bike-I guess you don't totally forget everything!).  Only weirdness was there was absolutely no touching of my breasts-and to think I went the lump route to maintain sensation...  Hopefully, I won't wait quite as long for the next romp and can try to address that issue. So what's up?  I'm thinking Kimberly, Paula and Kris should have some news for us-I'll read on. Boy LWDana, it sounds like you're doing all the right things to prepare yourself for your exam.  Hang in there. CathyCA-I'm just seeing your report from the 3day.  I know what you mean about how moving it is to see all the \"in memory of\" stuff.  I just did the Komen walk and was overwhelmed by it.  I can't imagine the magnitude at something like the 3day.  I'll read on and see how the rest of it went.  I'm really glad for you that you did this. Yeah, Paula, I imagined you were getting hit pretty hard by those storms in your holler.  Thanks for the scholarship link.  I checked it out and I'm not sure that will be one my dd will be eager to do as she was totally in to the denial thing the entire time I was sick last year.  I'll ask her, but I may have to look other places.  At least she has agreed to write essays to apply for some scholarships, so that's a part of the battle.  She's thinking about trying her hand at a screenplay for a scholarship through the Shakespeare theatre here in DC.  The deadline is some time in February, so much time for procrastination!  I think it would be a good one for her-it's a different kind of writing than that to which she is accustomed. I've been talking to some people with counseling experience and while I think it's a good idea for me to air things out (my first consultation even got me to talk to dh about how I feel-although that didn't go great), I think I may need to shop around to find a better listener.  I have a week or so to mull it over, so I'm not going to decide anything today, but I do have options. Hoping you have news on your trip to Duke... Just throwing it out there:  early July sounds good to me right now for our soiree. Happy belated cancerversary, Carla! So CathyCA-a new use for Aquaphor!  Good for you!  It sounds like you experienced your walk from several different angles-and all were moving.  I'm so glad that you did it.  I imagine you have a little empty space in your life right now that used to be filled up with planning for the walk, but it just means you'll have to do it again next year! Boy, I hear you, SISKimberly.  This must be another detour... I love that the tickets are having an impact-you are so creative! Flexi, hmmm.  Well, I feel like I'm a prisoner, but I guess I'm not, really.  Talking on the phone is best, and I like listening to NPR podcasts as a close second (This American Life, Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me and the Friday News Roundup).  Reading is my last choice as I'm flat on my back and have to hold my book up with one arm so I can see through my bifocals (yeah, I'm that old).  My arm gets tired and turning the pages is a hassle, but when I want to read, I do.  The hardest part is finding an hour everyday to do it.  I'm not always successful... Thanks for the reminder that it's all baby steps.  Sometimes I forget... Why doesn't it surprise me that you have a background in counseling?  I trust that your career path will proceed as it's meant to be.  There's a reason for everything. So I don't know, CHJ, most of us look forward to \"spring cleaning\" our houses, not our bodies!  Ask some questions on the ovary thing.  The advice I was given when I looked in to it was to keep my ovaries since removing them would not shut down my hormone production.  Apparently, your body's fat cells will pick up the slack if you remove the ovaries-making the surgery unnecessary.  The only part of it that worries me is the chance for ovarian cancer by keeping them.  My team says they're going to monitor me carefully, but thought, for me, the risk of the surgery was greater than the risk of ovarian cancer.  Time will tell, I guess. Wow, Julie, you're WAY ahead of me on the remodeling!  I need to get my dh to engage to achieve any forward motion.  Sometimes I wish he'd just say, \"you do it,\" but he doesn't.  I'm glad you're seeing some changes that make you happy.  (So, you cleaned yourself out just in time for the annual \"pigging!\"  What a great tactical move!  --How'd your scopes come out?) Oh Paula, I'm so sorry that the MRI showed a new tumor.  You and Ed have the most amazing attitudes.  You're inspirational.  I REALLY hope this new trial works.  I'll be thinking about you. Still waiting to hear about SISKim's deporting... Thanks for checking in, Carol.  Could nine is just different now, as is everything else in our lives.  Just enjoy. Kris-I'm so glad that you and your med team are on the same page.  YOU definitely deserve to eat too much today!  I'll be thinking about you on Monday. Oh yeah, Paula, a rewind button would be GREAT! Joan-good to hear from you.  Keep your fingers crossed-dd hears from Vassar on December 15! There's Sherry, again, forgetting to take a deep breath!  Goodness, girl, do you think you have enough stress in your life?  Try to relax and enjoy Thanksgiving.  You deserve the break. WoooHooo!  SISKimberly has sent her port out to sea!  Sounds like your procedure went much better than the woman before you.  I hope your recovery is quick and painless (or as painless as can be expected). Too bad you're not having your big meal on your cool dining set, LJ, but a moveable feast sounds like just the ticket for you guys today.  (And happy cancerversary, anyway.  You're just celebrating it your way.) Finally, thanks, Jewels.  This last year would have totally sucked without your support and friendship.  It always amazes me how total strangers can be brought together by an event and learn to love and support one another.  We've come such a long way together.  I hope we can continue to ride in to the future knowing a Jewel is always there. Happy Thanksgiving. D1",

Sheshe-My boob is very pink and sore.  In fact, it's not just my boob as my field goes up to my collarbone, under my arm and around my back over my shoulderblade.  It's HUGE!  And it's all pink/red.  My armpit is very dark (the rubbing on my compression garment doesn't help, but I have to wear it), and I have little blisters all around my nipple (those are NOT fun).  But the techs and my doc say they think my skin is holding up very well, so I'm going with the flow.  As you read, my last full field zap is tomorrow morning (I'll have completed 25 of the damn things).  Next week I move on to my boosts, which are concentrated zaps to my tumor beds (one on my boob and the other under my arm-oh boy).  Oh, and the coffee buds will return-I suddenly can't get enough java. SIS Kimberly-Oh man, just a few outing strung together in one day can just totally drain you.  I was EXHAUSTED after one or two activities by the time I reached my last chemo.  And it took a month before I felt energetic again.  It'll come back.  It's just hard to be patient after the last tx, isn't it?  You're SO OVER the whole se thing.  Try to be patient (easy for me to say, I'm past it). Wow Therese, you must be so excited about your implant surgery.  Like you said, one more hurdle.  Take it in style, I know you will. Oh Julie, what a long day for you.  I hope some of it turns out better than you suspect.  At least you got to lick your wounds with a surprise outing to Kohl's! I'm just sitting here shaking my head as I read about ds' rant about your hair.  I would've lost it, too (and I'm not a crier).  But there's something inside of me that suspects the rant was his way of releasing some of his pent-up fear/anger/whatever at bc.  It really sounded like a lashing out, but because the real focus of his rant wasn't available to him, he ranted at you.  Just speculation, but I've never gotten the impression from you that he's prone to this sort of thing.  I hope you can both forgive each other and move on.  (Oh, and when we get our sexies back, we're all gonna look 20 years younger, so there.) You've got a lot on your plate next week, Carol.  I could barely keep up with the comings and goings as I read it.  It'll be neat to reacquaint with Ginny after almost 20 years.  Hope you two recognize one another! Paula-Wendi's book arrived today, thanks.  I was really touched by the card you included and have decided the pen will live by the computer (I was using one I misappropriated from a hotel, so this one is MUCH better).  Thanks ever so much. Sounds like your rad sim was uneventful.  All the markings are weird, aren't they?  Mine came off right away and they had to redo them the next day.  When they marked me up for my boost sim, they remembered that the ink comes off me easily, so I got my boost tattoo on the same day, instead of waiting.  Hopefully, that will speed things along on Monday when I start.  Deb, you make me smile at how normal you are!  Hang in there. Well, it's after 5p here, so it's cocktail hour!   Woooohoooo!  (Not trying to gloat here, so if you're still not able to imbibe, please don't take offense.) Looks like a busy weekend for me.  Last full tanning session in the morning and then off to watch the dd play bball.  Our new upright freezer should be delivered tomorrow, too.  Hopefully, that will be in the early morning so dh can take care of it and we can all go to watch the little one shoot some hoops. I'll try to check in, but don't post TOO much-I hate that intimidated feeling when I've fallen behind a couple of pages! D1",

Speaking of moving along the road-Carol, didn't you have your MRI today?  Or should I say, will have it in a few hours.  I hope the big girl panties are wedgie-free as you get the IV for contrast. Yep, there's Carol's post confirming the MRI.  Sounds like you needed a lazy Sunday after your escapades with the steaks and vino on Saturday, my friend.  ;) So Sherry, I'm glad you were able to quit the Kmart job.  It sounds like it was really hard on your body.  Hopefully, the new desk and the at-home job will keep you financially sound and in better physical shape.  The only problem I have with working out of my home is that I can never really leave work.  My office space is like a magnet to me.  If you can figure out how to have down time, you're ahead of the game.  Happy to send the card.  It makes me happy that it made you happy.  I really wish I had everyone's address, because I'd love to send some cheer everywhere this time of year, but... OMG, SISKimberly!!!!  SISKath had my surgical procedure from hell!!!!!  If I NEVER do the guide wire thing again, it's too soon.  I can't tell you how relived I am to hear she was a trooper.  She deserves a medal, IMO. I'll be interested to hear what advice you get re: the ooph and hysterectomy.  My med team didn't think it would do me much good.  So I'm taking the Tamox and, quite frankly, I think it has me in a dangerous downward spiral mentally.  I want to cry all the time (not usually a crier, here, so this is weird).  And I'm riding my dh like some deranged nag.  Not that he doesn't deserve some of it, but I think I'm overboard.  So that's the reason for the Megace. Transition time (I'll get back to SISKim in a minute).  I Googled Megace.  Turns out, it's a drug for AIDS, anorexic and malnutrition patients.  It's SUPPOSED to stimulate the appetite.  Now I'm not sure if you all have been paying attention to me, but I'm a little obsessed with my weight.  AND this drug can cause anxiety and depression.  HELLO???  I'm already fucking depressed.  Do two wrongs make a right?  My onc only gave me a month's worth, and then I'm supposed to report in.  I guess I'll do it, but do I want to take an appetite stimulant during the holidays????  May I complain and say I want my life back??  Okay, rant over.  Maybe.  (I'm depressed, so I may rant again.) Wow, Kimberly, what an honor for your school!!!  And, if I may say so, they picked the right person to write the narratives. The redecorating sounds great.  Nothing like it for a pick me up.  My bathroom project is stalled till I can get my dh to look at some of the stuff I've scoped out.  I hope I don't have to start over... Yep, yep, our Paula is a SHERO!  Got that cape, Paula??? Oh, the CT scan.  In September 2007, when I first had all my scans after dx, my surgeon spotted a mass on my lung that looked suspicious to him, but he said let's deal with the bc first, then move on to that.  Well, I guess it's time to move on to that and discover it's nothing (I hope).  Funny though, I can't seem to pick up the phone to schedule it... Carol, a Jewel reunion sounds great to me.  Dd's graduation is June 18, so I can't really do anything before that.  My dh has been supportive of a reunion to date, so I'm going to take him at his word and say I'll be there! Hope the LG front loader stays the course.  I bought a Bosch front loader tandem a couple of years ago because they are so quiet (true) and my laundry area is practically in the middle of my house.  BUT, I found that you have to prop the door to the washer open after each use to allow it to dry out as the rubber seal for the door will get mildewy and you can't get rid of it.  Word to the wise. And that was a wonderful anniversary post.  I wish it had been mine. Norma, great post.  Thanks for catching us up.  Your new avatar is fabulous.  I can't believe how much hair you have!  Ouch on the Pilot's fog light.  Luckily, that was all the damage (trying to help you fill that glass half full again).  I ended up getting \"BO1BC0\" on my plates.  In fact, they arrived today and I was so excited that I put them on myself.  I can't wait to start driving around tomorrow! And good luck with your ovary us.  I guess I'll be getting that in the spring.  Don't these scans and tests make you crazy?  It's a full time job!  Do let us know what they say. Switching oncs.  Hmmm.  You know, I hadn't even thought of doing that.  Frankly, if you've found someone that makes you feel comfortable and gives you a sense of confidence, then that should be your doctor.  Having said that, I don't know if oncs are like surgeons (no surgeon likes to pick up after another surgeon-I learned that one the hard way).  I'd be interested to hear what others think. Happy Birthday, Maz!!!!!! Well, I'm going to check out the news.  I just wanted to drop in and say thanks to a bunch of most amazing people. D1",

Carol, enjoy the snow and send on the big girl panties to KathyL.  Happy wrapping! Carla, you hang in there.  And you can bring 15lbs of mashed potatoes to my house anytime and they'll be gone in a jiffy! Got my haircut and colored today.  We had to go short again because the Tamox is causing some bald spots.  This drug better be good because it's fucking up my return to normalcy.  Anyway, it does look better than when I was swirling it around to cover the bald areas and I really like the color.  I just keep hoping it will develop some body or something.  It's really fine (like newborn baby hair) and has no curl or anything (except at the nape of my neck where it curls out like wings.  Attractive.).  Life is good. We're down to one car since mine is in the shop and dh is off on a biz trip.  Tomorrow should be fun as college girl has to be at work at 6a, dd to school by 8:15, then I have to get to my gym, work out for an hour and a half and get back to pick college girl up from work by 11a.  After that, I'm hoping to hop in my machine for an hour, shower, and then head out for some last minute shopping before picking up dd at 3p.  I sure hope my car will be fixed and ready to pick up on Saturday.  Oh, and I have to find some time to do a few errands to get ready for the Booster snack bar tomorrow night.  Like I said, life is good. Guess I should turn in (even though it's only 9:30) as 5:30 will come early tomorrow (oh man, I just realized, I'll probably have to be up at 5 to be sure college girl gets her sorry ass outta bed...) D1 Oh, Tina, we have lefse here every year, although my mil has to make it.  My dh is totally Scandinavian (mostly Norge) and we eat it at all the holidays.  Guess that explains part of the reason I'm such a Vikings fan!  (Can you believe they're on top of their division?  The Bears have a better schedule for the remainder o f the season, but it won't stop me from donning my Vikings sweatshirt-the one with the holes in the armpits-and cheering like a mad woman!)",

Trying to get back to normal-purple boob and all.  I'll admit, though, I'm completely fried.  All this running around and thinking has me wiped out.  I don't know how you working Jewels do it.  A reminder to me what SHEROES you all truly are. Wow, Julie, sounds like the ds is getting honors all around.  First for wrestling, then for being such a great ds on Mother's Day.  Must've been superior parenting... Oops, Carol, LOL!  Didn't even make the weepies connection.  Glad you're smiling about it today. WVgirl, you sound stronger than you ever have.  You go, girl.  (Yeah, I have noticed that men are at the start of our problems!  Ha!) Hope your dh time was sublime last night, KathyL.  How nice to have a \"routine\" day.  How's your energy holding up?  (Maybe you younger Jewels will have the advantage on that score.) SIS Kimberly-Loved the pet segue in your shout to LJ13.  That kind of stuff always appeals to me for some reason (I know, I'm a total nerd).  Interesting thought about chemo and our skin.  It's hard for me to believe that chemo helped any part of my body, but it's possible.  Maybe I should sacrifice myself and get a facial and see if I get any compliments...  (All in the name of science, of course.) Hooray for Paula!  I'm big into exercising my right to vote (and I like politics, but I'll refrain from getting into them here).  Glad to see you went out to be heard!  My motto is, \"If you don't vote, you can't complain.\" CHJ-So glad you checked in with us.  And you had so much to share!  Congrats on getting the housing issue settled.  I know it will be painful next week (I HATE moving), but you guys will be so glad to be in a new place.  I think you're right, a change in scenery will do your souls good.  Hang in on the rads.  I just finished mine and I will say about the only advice I can give is exercise, lotion, and hydration.  It really is easy compared to chemo.  A big WoooHooo to you on the clean mammo! Hey, LWDana, glad to hear your doc is staying on top of things for you.  Bummer to have the chemo postponed, but it sounds like you're in good hands.  Keep fighting.  We don't call you LW for nothing! I need to watch my tivo'd DWTS, too.  Maybe I'll toddle off and do that now... D1",

Anyway, I'll be back to see what you all are up to soon.  If I remember correctly, no one is in the lounge tomorrow.  So let's celebrate our days off!!!!

Forgot to mention Willie and his escapades!  Mom doubled over with laughter when my sis and I greeted her in the airport with him.  He ended up going everywhere with us and got a lot of attention.  I was surprised by the number of people who'd met Willie Nelson.  Turns out, when he's in Austin (which is home to him), he just mixes with the regular folk (he's probably so high all the time that he doesn't realize that he's a celebrity).  Anyway, most everyone had a Willie story to tell my mom and she loved the attention.  Unfortunately, on our last morning there, we were eating breakfast at a table with one of those large umbrellas over it and it suddenly started to rain torrentially.  We were thinking it was good we were under that umbrella, but the mist on the air blew on to our table and on to Willie.   Since he was just a photo mounted on cardboard, the mist got on his face and made it blotchy.  It looked like he has some kind of contagious disease!  My mom was really upset, but my sister told her that it was now part of the Willie saga.  (He already had a blotch on his face from a margarita spill earlier in the weekend...)  We certainly had a lot of folks laughing at Willie over the weekend, so it was worth the 3 hours (!) I put into making him. So today was good.  My friend who'd really taken care of me during chemo had surgery yesterday to repair her deviated septum.  I stopped and got her her favorite lunch of ½ matzo ball soup and ½ chicken soup (there's a diner here that mixes it for her, she goes so often!).  It was nice, because the manager gave me the soup for free and I just paid for my sandwich.  Then I stopped at the local Starbucks we haunt occasionally to pickup coffees for the two of us.  I hadn't been in to the Starbucks since I started chemo and it just so happened that the manager was there today.  She was so glad to see me that she gave me the coffees for free!  So lunch for the two of us cost $8 for the sandwich!!!  Oh, and I've gotten out of parking garages 11 times so far without paying because of the balditude.  Cancer does have some privileges!  (I know, that's sick, but you have to find the humor...) Good luck to LJ13 for tomorrow's surgery.  Let us know how it goes when you're feeling up to it. Okay, it's 5:30 to me and I haven't had anything to drink for two days (well, I had to take a break-I certainly drank my share over the weekend!).  I think I'll go pour me a glass of wine.  Love that glass for cocktail hour...

First of all, good luck to Sherry/sheshe48 tomorrow.  If I remember correctly, you start chemo tomorrow.  It seems to me there were others in our group who started this week (wvgirl, maybe?/Diana63?), but I'm having trouble keeping track (can I blame this on chemo brain?).  Please remind me, everyone, of your big days because I really want to keep good thoughts for each of you on those days.  It's important to me to focus my thoughts on helping you all through this, just as I'm trying to keep myself under control. SIS Kimberly, you are our poet laureate.  You brought tears to my eyes.  Thank you.   (And you REALLY got Jewels!!!  How cool is that??) So it's CMF for you, Carol?  Must feel good to have your tx set.  I remember how impatient I got once I knew what was coming.  I just wanted to GET ON WITH IT.  Get your ducks in a row--tx day will be here soon.  And may I say I'm SO jealous that you don't have to have the neulasta shot?  That has been the worst of it so far for me. LJ13--get your partner a Starbucks gift card and tell her to get her java fix outta your smell line.  (And have her walk the dog--if you have one--while she's doing it!  Everyone wins!) I'm still having a cuppa joe in the morning, but just one.  And tonight I'm having a beloved bourbon and water.  Haven't felt like alcohol for a while and this tastes fabulous!  I'm more of a wine drinker of late, but I can't seem to enjoy it right now.  Maybe another night.  Water is tasting pretty vile--have switched to Vernors (I used to drink it whenever I was sick as a kid growing up in Michigan and managed to find it here in Virginia!). New weirdnesses to report:  I break into a full body sweat (not like the hot flashes I was having as I approached menopause), for no apparent reason.  I mean, I rub my finger across my skin and come up with so much sweat that it drips from my finger.  I also started my period today, even though they told me those would be over for me.  (You know, I don't believe this whole period thing.  I was told that I could avoid chemo if I was post-menopausal, so I took the blood test to check three different times.  Every time the test said I was post-menopausal, but I kept having periods.  So I'm doing the chemo.  Now, when they say I should be in chemopause, I'm having another one.  What's up with that?  And they told me not to use tampons because they were concerned that I would tear myself.  Well, I have never used pads and never will.  I'm bleeding already, for crying out loud.  Who would know if I tore myself???  Rant, sorry.)  Final new development--my scalp is numb!!!!  Did a respectable job blowing out the new 'do today, but I figure by the time I get good at it, the hair will be gone.  Ah well.  The cancer is totally f*cked, so what do I care?  FUBC. Keep smiling, Vettegal.  You sound good today. You okay, Yuyu? IowaCindy--thanks so much for the encouragement.  I know you understand how much it means to us.  Please stop by anytime. MAMHOP--YOU GO GIRL!  I'm pm-ing you. It's on, ladies--WE ARE THE JANUARY JEWELS!!!! D1",

Jenn-I'm lol on the beets.  No one in my house likes them, either, so whenever I go to one of those salad bars, I load up on the spinach leaves and beets.  Makes your poo red, tho, so I always have to remember that I ate beets and not freak out!  (TMI, I know, but what do you expect from me?) I grew up in Michigan and we had fresh fruit and veggies, too.  Like you, I'd eat them right out of the garden.  We had a very cool hand pump in the garden and we could wash the dirt off and eat ourselves sick-which we did regularly.  The memories really make me smile. I can't tell you how excited I am to have painters doing this work.  I think my dh caved on the idea because of the bc thing.  Usually he does the painting, and he's very good, but it takes FOREVER.  One time he painted these same rooms and it took him 3 years to finish!!!!  I got him to paint the powder room about 5 years ago and he still hasn't done the touchup work.  Our house is in total disarray while the painting is going on, but I know it's only for a week-not years! Wow, restless legs sound awful!  I don't have that problem.  The only issue I have with my legs is that I find I'm really creaky for a few minutes after getting up from a seated position, or out of bed in the morning.  I hobble around like an old person till things loosen up and I can get on with it.  You should see me get out of the car!  OMG, anyone looking on would swear I'm 108! Carol-LOL on you and KathyL and your distress passing quickly!  You're such a hoot (ew, is that a bad choice of words????). Oh, and thanks for the kind words.  You have me stubbing my toe into the ground saying, \"aw, shucks.\" Congrats to the dh on the new job!  I'm not wild about my spouse's travel, either (I'm sure you've all noticed that he seems to be gone a couple of days each week), but if there's some additional payola for you and happy homecomings, maybe it'll be the right thing for you guys. Hey Julie, I'm jealous over the pool (not the cleanup, but that you have one).  We always wanted one, but our yard is teeny, so no pool for us.  Sounds like the storms got the best of some of your outdoor toys.  We had the storm yesty and I can see that a couple of our neighbor's trees that border our lot have lost some large limbs.  Bummer.  I have always liked the natural \"fence\" some big old trees create.  I hope the fallen limbs don't mean she'll take the trees down... CathyCA-so how's the new Indy movie?  I'm hoping to see it soon (we never seem to have time to go to the theater anymore-gotta get these kids off to college-both of them-so we can have more date nights).  I also want to catch the Sex and the City movie.  Loved the tv show.  Where are you guys going in Russia?  We had Russia on the table for our summer trip this year, but no one bit.  We're going to Croatia (the Dalmation Coast, only) and then hopping a plane for Istanbul.  Should be a real study in cultural differences!  I'm hoping we can stay in the hotel in Istanbul that used to be the prison featured in Midnight Express.  That would be so cool, as long as they don't hang ME by my feet for the duration of my stay! The balditude isn't cutting it with the painters, SIS Kimberly, because the head guy is just back on his feet after a crippling leg break.  The poor guy can hardly get around, but he's here, mostly supervising.  I could see the pain in his face yesty afternoon when they were finishing up and asked him about it.  He seemed relieved that I was so empathetic.  But no discounts.  Better find another $20 today when I go for my therapy! I really hope your onc settles down when he gets back from vaca.  You both have valid arguments for your positions, but he has to acknowledge that at the end of the day, you're in charge of your body, not him.  Stay strong and I know your winning personality will warm him up again. LOL on the cream of wheat guess!  You KNOW Carol's eating that stuff like a mad woman! Ah Katrina and the Waves, right?  Love that song, too.  It's so happy. Doh, read on and see that Carol didn't have cream of wheat!  Are the stars out of alignment or something??? Paula-you have incredible strength.  I know you and dh are overwhelmed with information right about now, but it sounds like you're sifting through and coming to your decision.  I'll do my best to send you positive energy and wishes for a good outcome.  Hey, Julie, how'd the bball go for your ds?  We're all about basketball in our house.  Dh and both dds played.  My dh was actually recruited by a few colleges (biggest was the University of Arizona) in his day, but at the ripe old age of 18 realized that he'd never make it to the NBA, so decided to go to college to study and only played ball for fun.  He misses it sometimes (especially now, when his knees won't let him play), but he has some really fond memories.  I hope my girls look back on basketball when they're older and know that the things they learned on the court apply to all parts of life. So today I see my legu again, who will have more therapies to help my rotator cuff.  That thing is really painful!  It keeps me up at night because I can't get comfortable.  It's funny, before it was dx'd as rotator cuff, I was thinking it was le-related and resigned myself to learning to live with this new pain.  Now that I know it can be resolved, I have very little patience for it.  The mind is a terrible thing sometimes. Okay, going to check on my painters.  I put out some homemade banana muffins for them this morning, hoping they'll give me something as a bonus... (such a conniver, I know). D1",

I'm four months out from my last chemo, and I'm hoping it's enough for my eyes to settle.  I really need to do something, though, I can't see to read worth a damn. Today is going to be HECTIC!!!  It's 9:30am here and I've already washed one load of laundry, read the paper and been to the gym (my usual one is closed today, so dd and I had to drive all the way across town to another community center).  After posting, Ima go shower and then head off with dd to our eye appointment.  On the way home we're going a little out of our way to swing by the mall to look at the prom dress I mentioned last night.  Then get dd home in time to head off to work.  After that, I take college girl to Bed, Bath and Beyond to pick up some dorm essentials (whatever that means-just bring the debit card, mom!).  I'm hoping I can have my feet up somewhere by 6p! I went out to the yard yesty to supervise college girl's weeding project while her sister was at work (she needed the company and moral support in case of wormage).  Of course, I couldn't help myself and I was right there with her weeding away.  An hour and a half later my hand had ballooned up at the end of my compression sleeve (I don't normally wear the glove, anyway).  Shit!  I came in right away and elevated my arm and did the MLD that my legu taught me and the swelling came down.  I don't think I'm going to like this le stuff much. Good news is that I was able to sleep with the pillows as instructed by the rotator specialist and actually almost slept through the night (usual night sweats woke me up a couple of times, but I was able to go back to sleep).  Hopefully, I can keep this up. Oh, and here's my list of se's from the Tamox:  increased hot flashes (oh, mama!), increased sappiness and the feeling that tears are \"right there,\" and muscle cramps.  I just realized the last one this morning when my toes were doing that \"out of body\" thing that William Hurt did in the movie \"Altered States\" and hurting like heck.  Then I started putting together the fact that I've been having a lot of those leg and stomach muscle cramps that I used to get during pregnancy.  I need to go check my se list for Tamox, but I think I can blame all of these things on that drug.  (So why did I get one of those bodies that overreacts to drugs?)  I'm going to talk to my gyn about all of this next week. Anyway, that the news here.  Can't wait to see what everyone else is up to when I have a chance to peek in next time! D1",

Thanks for the double-check, KathyL, I think we're good for now.  Glad to hear your dad did well today.  He'll be happy to see you.  Be forewarned that bypass surgery patients have LOTS of tubage (I was taken aback when I saw my dad--he was always so big and strong and brave and I couldn't believe the guy on the bed with all the stuff attached was the same man.).  And you'll be okay with the hair.  The head hair comes out whenever I run my hand thru it--so weird.  Even weirder is when you pull the panties down to relieve yourself and see whats stuck in the cotton!  But it doesn't hurt, yet, so I'm just going to go with the flow. Good to hear from you, Deb.  Can't believe you're working!  You go, girl! Shout out to LJ13 and Carol!!  Bottoms up, gals! D1",

Goodness Deb, I don't know how you're staying at work.  I'm tired just being home!  Rest up this weekend.  D1's orders!!! I forgot about my egg cravings, SIS Kimberly!  For 2-3 days there, all I wanted was fried eggs!  I even dictated how to make one to my college girl, who, sadly burned the egg, but I still thought it was delicious.  (Unfortunately, I tried to dictate how to clean the pan and stove afterwards, but that fell on deaf ears.)  Stick with small meals.  It sounds like you're trying to do all the right things.  I took a Colace every night for the first 5 nights after treatment to keep the constipation junta at bay--it did seem to help.  I had the worst gas EVER, but I had a bm every day.  Come back and moan and whine later.  We're always up for it. Your port experience sounds just awful, WVgirl.  I'm so sorry you went through that.  (I would've passed out on the floor from what you described, but I'm pretty much a pussy when it comes to needles.)  I guess the upside is that you know how to advocate for yourself next time, so the tech gets the right needle size for you.  Are you doing okay with se's? DianeB--that sounds like you all had quite the scare.  Bet your dh wanted a strong drink after that episode.  It's funny that you'd mention acupuncture.  When I was at my Look Good, Feel Better seminar, the other cancer patient there was waxing eloquent about acupuncture.  She said it was really helping her with the se's.  If you can do the needle thing, go for it.  Personally, I'd be in such a lather about the needles that it would do more harm than good.  (Like I said, a real pussy.) Finally, LJ13--what great news about your shrinkage!  You gotta be dancing, girl!  (Well, if the se's will let you.)  And you're halfway through the first leg of tx.  Even more reason to celebrate.  We'll be waiting to hear your HER2/NEU results... Thinking about billsgirl and Amy... Left another rodent in the shower drain.  My college girl says it's larger than yesterday.  Then I told her to check in the wastebasket to see the hair I pulled out before my shower!  It's EVERYWHERE you guys!  I still managed to style it, but it's kinda like the hair you see on really old ladies--you know, you can see clear through to their scalps.  I'm a little intimidated thinking about going to my kid's basketball game tonight since I have to go alone (dh doesn't get back till the morning), but I know I'll just hold my almost hairless head up and march on in to the gym.  I just gotta go through all that \"lack of confidence\" mumbo jumbo before I get to my happy place.  Most def have to get the family out to buy the wig in the morning! Hands still itch today, but not as much.  Another se that hangs out for about 3 days and then fades till next time... Guess I should go do something on my to do list.  Gotta get through that thing before tx day on Wednesday! Later. D1",

Hey Joan, a big, ol fat WooooHoooo to you on the clean exams!!!  Way to go!  Hope the potty training continues without too much trouble (that dog is downright adorable). Keep laughing, Carla.  It sounds like he needs some attention and knows you're about to go in to your surgery and won't be available to give it to him.  In fact, he's probably scared to death about the prospect of having to give it to you!  Just have someone on hand to help you out and you're going to be great.  I'll be thinking about you tomorrow. Deb-the total exhaustion will start to fade.  I'm finding I have more and more energy every day, but it's taking me a long time to get here.  I, too, am just sick and tired of being sick and tired.  The tm will help you regain your energy-try to make a date with it a couple of times a week (or more, if you can stand it), and keep the date.  Soon it will become habit and you'll really miss it if you don't hop on for 20 minutes.  The hardest part is getting started.  You can do it. I totally hear you on the activism.  I think that's why I'm participating in all of these studies.  For some reason, I'm really compelled to give something of myself to the bc community.  (I also think I'm having some survivor guilt, which I'm going to discuss here soon.  It's starting to get in my way.) I hope the massage goes well, KathyL.  After a 12 hour day I'd say you totally deserve some pampering. Another WoooHooo off to Carol for ending the PNW drought!!!!  (And the pressure mounts....) I'm with you, Carol, we need a Jewel celebration to mark the last of the gems to cut the lights in the chemo lounge.  Way to go, Kris! FUBC!!!!  The January Jewels are tougher than you!!!!! Um.  Should go check my laundry and get the house ready for the ladies to come in and clean.  Shine on today, everyone! D1",

So, SIS Kimberly, you're probably back from your excursion by now.  I hope the hired hand is keeping you out of fire danger.  I think about you all the time when I hear the stories. You pose some good thoughts about the communication thing.  In all honesty, I see it as an excuse.  My mom always said the reason she and my dad divorced was because he wasn't a great communicator.  Problem was, he wasn't great with words, but if you listened to him, you could hear what he had to say.  My mom just didn't have the patience.  Now I think my dh is just using that, \"you're just like your dad\" line instead of listening to me.  Sometimes I'm patient enough to get past all of that and other times, frankly, I'm not.  Unfortunately, we (neither of us) is working hard to find time to talk to one another, so things tend to drag on (witness the fact that we haven't even discussed the genetic testing issue, yet).  I have been content to wait it out, but now that I've been through the bc thing, I suddenly find I'm feeling more of a sense of urgency.  Since dh didn't have bc, he's not where I am.  I think we'll get there (mostly because we want to), but I think we have more time to put in.  Another sigh. Now, on to topics less deep.  OMG, girl, I'm LOL rolling on the floor with your definition of the vapors!  (As if I need any help in the flatulence department-she writes while she munches on hummus and pita.) Oh, yeah, I meant to respond to Carla's comment about 1\" a month, too.  Carla, don't mean to burst your bubble, but I'm nowhere near that growth rate.  Although it sure would be nice... Carol, interesting that they're sending you straight to Femara.  My onc said even if I am completely post-menopausal, he wants me to take Tamox for a period of time because of the bone building it does.  I think somewhere down the road I'll switch to an AI.  It seems to me he mentioned at least 8 months on Tamox, though (this of a 5-10 year sentence of HT).  Try not to freak yourself out on the se's (I certainly did with the Tamox and it hasn't been that horrible).  If it gives you peace of mind (it did me), then see your gyn or gp for a complete physical before you start so you establish a baseline and tell them you're anxious about taking the Femara.  They may put you on an enhanced screening schedule to keep you at peace (my gyn is doing that for me).  Oh, and congratulations on achieving a new plateau in womanhood!!!  Now you can fly without a net at any \u2018ol time!!  ;) OMG, you guys are cracking me up today-KathyL, suggesting I de-clothe my dh!!!  But I don't understand how that will alleviate my hot flashes... Hey Sherry, not to worry about being MIA.  The painting class sounds great.  Good therapy, IMO.  I'll bet you're there right now!  I'd love to see a pic of your dress for the wedding.  You must all be getting very excited.  What a good thing to have in your life right now. Oh, Carla, you should've heard the sharp intake of breath I experienced as I read with relief about your path report.  I have goosebumps for you!  Good move on talking to someone about your options with the dh.  It sounds like you're ready to see what's out there.  I think when you see what you can do and lay it out for your mom, she'll be more supportive.  I imagine right now she's fearing what could happen and doesn't know what you can plan for yourself.  Give her time to catch up to you in her thinking-you've been mulling this over for a long time and have adjusted to what you want to do.  She's still reeling from the news.  Stay strong and focused.  You will do the right thing in the end.  (At least if you do get head lice, the twice daily nit picking will be a breeze!) LJ-you know, my dad always called me a goofy doof.  I take it as a compliment. Loved the story on the emerald.  I'll bet your mom is so happy to know you have it. Man SIS Kimberly, how do you keep up with yourself?  I'll be by for the bbq, sounds delish!!! Okay, I'm off to start making some headway on my to do list.  I have never figured out how it gets so big each and every day! Happy Friday! D1",

The mom is good.  I'm supposed to be reading the next draft of the book she's writing and she calls me in the afternoons (and I love chatting away with her), but that's the time I'd read.   So I guess I'll be lugging the manuscript on the plane with me.  It's heavy. You keep mentioning your cooking classes, CathyCA.  There's a part of me that wonders if that would be something in which I'd be interested.  I used to hate cooking, but in recent years I find I actually like it-as long as I have a lot of time and don't have to do the shopping.  Otherwise, I think my dh feels the way you do about the kitchen-it's his territory!  Our cupboards extend to the ceiling in our house, which is okay for him, he's 6'5\", but I have to use a stool to get the stuff down and I'm 5'9\"! Thanks, KathyL, the nail thing totally blows.  I'm trying to decide if I should go without polish on cation (I haven't been without polish on my toes for probably 15 years), or if I should brush up on my Vietnamese and try to talk to my nail gal about some sort of acrylic for the big toes till they grow out so I can polish them.  (I don't know why, buy I really like the toenail polish.)  The other toes are fine.  They're short (read that to say slivers of nail), but my toes aren't much anyway, so a short nail isn't the end of the world.  But the big toes, now that's my statement.  And I like the way the polish looks with my toe ring-it's all plain without the polish...  What a dilemma... So how's your dog?  Sam is the same age as Kippy and I don't think of that as old.  I hope the seizures have abated and that he's back to his old self. Sherry-I can see what Kimberly means about the color, but I really like your dress and like what you're trying to do with the color scheme of the wedding.  Perhaps her idea of a scarf or (was it Paula?) the idea of experimenting with a little more makeup would keep you from washing out.  Frankly, I think your gigantic smile will brighten up everything. It sucks that you're experiencing energy problems with the Tamox.  I stopped taking it today for 3 weeks and am interested to watch my body and see what, if any, changes I notice.  You better believe I'll be telling you all what I experience. LWDana-I think I'm the resident le expert (although if anyone wants the mantle, I'm more than happy to pass it on).  To be safe, I'd wear a sleeve when you zip line.  I wear one when I exercise or do something strenuous-like clean house (I haven't had sex, yet, so I don't know if I need the sleeve for that-ooops, TMI).  A zip line requires you to use strength and hold your arm in a position for a period of time-those are le no-no's.   If you have a sleeve, wear it.  You can wash it out in the sink in your hotel to keep it fresh.  Use the hotel shampoo bottles for soap and then roll your sleeve up in a towel to \"wring\" out the excess water.  It should dry overnight.  You do not want to aggravate anything.  My sleeves are from a company called Juzo and even though they can make me sweat, I find I can wear them at the gym and be fine (I've adjusted-so give yourself a chance).  There are apparently different thicknesses of sleeve, but I've never specified anything and have gotten the same sleeve 4 times already.  If you need more info, let me know and I'll go upstairs and check on the style number to pass along.  I'm feeling lazy right now. Oh, and a zip line is a most exhilarating experience!  I absolutely love doing that! PALady, you make me smile with your stories of your reflection.  Haven't we all been there??? Well, LJ.  Since you have not posted a pic of yourself with your very cool \u2018do, I think I can claim the prize.  Perhaps you look almost as good as I do.... Take it easy on the weights during rads.  I think my overzealousness contributed to my rotator cuff issue.  Rads will kinda tighten everything up (it will go away, so don't panic), but in the meantime, you don't want to do any damage.  Slow going on the weights and keep up the cardio-I think that's the ticket.  Oh, and stretching is muy importante.  But I think you're in to that already, if I remember correctly.  And the \"old person\" joints are too familiar.  I think mine was from the Taxotere (a cousin of Taxol), and it took much longer to dissipate than I expected, so don't be surprised.  Our oncs are in denial most of the time when it comes to se's (who wants to think they're responsible for so many aches and pains?), so  believe in yourself-you're in tune with your body and you know what's up. Example:  my dh and I were just chuckling last week over the fact that I no longer seem to have urinary leakage when I exercise.  At the end of chemo I mentioned to my onc that I was having to wear a pad in my panties to combat leakage at the gym and wondered if that was a chemo se.  He said no, I should see a urologist.  Well, here I am 5 months out from chemo and suddenly realizing that the leakage is no longer a problem.  Coincidence???  I think not. Paula-amazing amazon post!  So fun to hear you weighing in-I really appreciate your point of view.  I lol at you having to unload your dishwasher and wash by hand-we've gone through 3 dishwashers in 14 years here and I know all too well the frustration of realizing that all that crap in the dw has to be washed by hand.  Ugh.  Personally, I think the dishwasher is a necessity, not a luxury. And then more insurance issues... So happy to hear that Ed is installing the dishwasher.  That's a great sign.  I hope things continue to go well for him.  I'll continue to send good vibes. I think you're right about Carol's back burner.  Since she's zapping a pancake, she doesn't have all the fatty tissue the rest of us have to absorb the rays, so it's passing right through her.  What a trooper she is. Oh, and you all are talking about your sons as video junkies.  May I say we did not get an x-box for a very long time, even though my dh asserted that the girls would \"love\" it as a Christmas present.  When we finally got one, it was very apparent that the x-box was for him!  He likes Halo, Guitar Hero (but only when one of us is around to \"challenge\"-read that to say lose to him), and Call of Duty.  He used to love the NBA game, but dd created an uber team that crushed him every time, so they stopped playing.  He really is just a boy. Kris-I'm taking St. Joe's every day, too.  Funny the blood clots scare me, too.  I think they scare my onc because he's having me take a break while I'm on cation since there's so much flying involved in my trip.  I can't believe I'll be on a plane in a week and on my way!!! You know what?  Fuck you cancer.  I'm getting on with life. Well now, that's a good place to stop, isn't it? D1",

I'm very happy to report that my new SP has sent me a CD to help with my wine appreciation!  Thanks, SP!  Soon, I'll have no excuses for being uneducated when it comes to vino.  I was thinking that my card with likes/dislikes was pretty lame (particularly after seeing a couple of others, now), so here's some more help for you:  I like music (pretty much anything but opera and really heavy metal) and am really in to my iPod, I'm getting more and more interested in cooking, so if you have some favorite recipes (go easy on me) to share, I'm game for that (those cream cheese brownies of KathyL's were SOOOO fattening, but yum-city!)  Oh, and along with the cooking, I like exercising and could use some new ankle weights and so forth, so gift certificates to stores with exercise gear is good.  That's all that came to me in the past 24 hours. So, Sherry, how are the muscles?  I can't believe you're standing all day and then moving into a new bedroom.  Do you ever rest?  What's the report from the newlyweds? Carol, wow, your gf has her hands full with the new baby.  How are they doing?  I really don't know much about that condition. I got dd#2 off to her senior year of high school this morning.  She was beside herself with excitement.  A bunch of girls in her class designed these t-shirts for the first day of school that said something about being \"senior girls\" and how the view from the top was better.  I'm not sure how many of the gals wore them, but my kid was so cute.  I sent her a text today, wishing her well, and she responded a bit later saying it was all good, so hopefully she'll be able to keep up with the work of all those APs. Not sure how to bottle her academic-ness up, Carol.  In all honesty, I think there's something wrong with her.  I mean, how many 17 year olds read Dostoevsky, Sartre, and Camus for summer fun?  I just hope she stays happy and fulfilled. Some stability for your ds sounds like a good plan, Carol.  These high school years can be really rough-I mean these kids feel so much pressure to \"find\" themselves, while separating from their parents.  It can make for some tricky footing along the way.  It's a lot of work, particularly since he has essentially 2 sets of parents keeping an eye on him, but if you can all communicate what you see/suspect I think ds will be better for it.  I know we talked about friends (my dad always said \"you are the company you keep\"), but if anyone can figure out how to steer a kid from some bad influences, I'm all ears.  As I told you, Carol, we had some friend issues with college girl when she was in high school and all I could remember was how my parents would forbid me to see a pal and that always made me want to see that person more.  So I stayed away from the forbidden route, but I think my distaste for some of her selections came through loud and clear.  If you can get ds to invite his gang home for some chillaxin', then you're at least going to be able to do some monitoring.  It will all come out okay in the end.  Remember, we learned everything we needed to know by the time we finished kindergarten! I cannot believe your 3-day is just around the corner.  You'll be ready.  I have faith in you. Oh, KathyL, I remember those first day tears.  I still get them some years (not this year, I guess we were well-prepared this time).  I hope your kids keep their enthusiasm all year long.  Oh, and WTG on getting those old items ready for the consignment shop.  That's as big a job as practically moving, imo. I'm also hoping we'll get a chance to meet.  When we were driving up through Philly I thought of you when we passed the Middletown sign.  I remember when we took dd to that basketball tourney in NY that you said we went right by you when we passed the sign.  I rolled down the window this time and shouted a hello-I hope you heard it! Thanks for the comments about the hair.  I know what you mean about people giving you compliments now.  Some folks who say something about my hair didn't even know the pre-chemo me, so have no idea how I see myself when I look in the mirror.  I think that was part of what Joan was grappling with when I saw her.  (Still going topless, Joan???  I hope so.) You must be incredibly disciplined, Paula, to be at your computer and get your lesson plans done without getting distracted by the thread.  I'm supposed to be drafting some essays about dd for the school guidance counselor to use (likely completely plagiarize) when she's crafting recommendation letters for dd for colleges.  I feel a lot of pressure to do a good job by my kid, but not so much pressure that I'm skipping my dose of the Jewels first! The McLean Hilton is even easier for me to get to than heading in to the District, so I'm so there!  Just let me know when and I'll come running! Sounds like you're coming out of rads okay, LJ.  I was really glad to hear that your arm pain is dissipating.  I cannot wait to get back to my old lifting regimen-hearing about yours makes me anxious to do those things again (except the bench press-not into that one).  LOL at your dp and the oopsies on the hair.  I don't think I could pay my dh to trim my hair-course, I wouldn't want him to!!!  Seems my hair growth has stalled again (thank you Tamoxifen), so I'm going to get it colored again on Friday and try to focus on the money I'll be saving by not having to go back so soon.  Only 57 more bottles of Tamoxifen to go! Kris-so glad the alien implant has left the building.  You made me laugh with that one.  When do you get to look at it (the scar, not the alien)? Hmm.  It's already 2p here and I have sooooo many things on the to do list.  Guess I need to get to getting. Later. D1",

Everyone, yes, it's the photos that mess up the layout.  But I agree with whomever it was that said I'd much rather scroll around than not see everyone's smiling face. Paula--you have back spasms, too??!  My onc told me they weren't a se of anything, but they are VERY real.  I'm trying physical therapy to avoid taking too many muscle relaxants (I hate how they make me loopy) and I'll let you know how that goes. Diane63--glad you were switched to the neupogen.  I tried to get my onc to switch me, but he really likes neulasta (must get kickbacks...), so he wants to keep me on that unless I just cannot tolerate it.  I think the more frequent, smaller doses are better for the body.  My onc tried to scare me away from it, reminding me that it's more shots and I'm afraid of needles.  He didn't seem to grasp the fact that the neulasta is so bad to me that I don't mind the extra shots!  Oh well, only two more to go for me... WVgirl--I agree with SIS Kimberly, no more newbies.  When I go to the hospital and need an IV, I request someone from the anesthesia dept. up front and they work with me on it.  There's no reason you couldn't request a senior nurse--particularly if you tell them how much trouble others have been having accessing your port.  And I also liked her spin to your dh.  Mine was pretty much inaccessible during my surgeries, till I discovered I was creating the problem by inviting my mom in to take care of me.  It was great having my mom there during the day, but in the evening, she couldn't stop with the care-giving and she and the dh were on each other's toes.  Eventually the dh checked out of care giving.  Now that I'm doing chemo, I told my mom that I wanted the dh and I to \"own\" this experience together and wanted him to come with me (even though I know my mom would be better at it--he just plays with his blackberry the whole time).  Upshot is, he's more involved with what's going on with me.  It was great that he saw me have a bad reaction during my 2nd tx, cuz now he's really focused on the fact that this is for real.  (Even my kids have noted the change in attitude.)  So if you can give him some concrete things you need from him (i.e. SIS Kimberly's suggestion), you may find he'll respond.  I really hope he does. Like SIS Kimberly, I find after some exertion I'm kinda drained and I need to get the house vacuumed and green beans cleaned before the next urge to just sit overwhelms me.  So I'll sign off for now. KathyL--are you home, yet??? D1",

First of all, Deb,  I'm so glad you have a tx#2 scheduled.  You wrote that it was to be Fri, Feb 2, but Fri is Feb 1, so I'm going with Feb 1.  And I hope the neupogen and procrit injections are what's needed to keep you on schedule.  You do not need to suffer that disappointment again. WVgirl--Sorry to hear that your pooper is not popping.  Looks like you got some ringing endorsements for miralax, so I'd give it a go!  (Hmm.  Was that a bad pun, maybe?)  Oh, and I've got to tell you, since Carol kinda brought it up.  When I first started on these boards I kept reading dh, dh, dh and I knew it was shorthand for husband, but I didn't know what on earth the \"d\" could stand for.  So I posted a comment and asked, \"Does dh stand for dickhead???\"  (You know where my affections for my husband lie...)  Anyway, the gals on that thread and I decided that sometimes our dh's are dickheads, so whenever you see me use all caps for dh, you'll know I mean my guy is being a dickhead at that moment and when it's in lower case, it means dear husband.  I think we could all use that rule of thumb on this thread, too! Diana63--I'm glad you're trying to resolve your finance situation.  I can't imagine the additional stress that is for you and I'm so sorry for it.  Please don't give up on it. So, SIS Kimberly, your girls are the full grown size now, are they?  You pleased?  So when do they switch them out?  (Sorry, I'm not up on the recon lingo--I chose the Frankenboob route and was not disappointed!)  And I must say, you sound really good--glad you're making the most of your \"feel good\" days. CHJ--Both LJ13 and KathyL are right.  I, too, have experienced a \"set back\" day after a chain of good ones, but I do think, given KathyL's experience, that it would be prudent to keep an eye on your temp, just in case. Carol--I know you feel left out not getting the nasty-lasta.  But count your lucky stars, girl.  That f*cking shot makes all your joints so unbelieveably painful that you can't even walk for 2 days.  The reason is that it boosts white blood cell production for those of us on chemotinis that wipe out our white blood cells.  Without the shot, we're at serious risk for infection (reference KathyL's recent visit to the hospital for evidence of what happens to us without the boost).  The neupogen shot you see some of us talk about, does the same thing, but it's given in a series of 5 injections (rather than one) and as a result, the se's aren't as bad (some say there are none).  The difficulty with 5 injections is that patients either have to go to their treatment center every day for 5 days to get the shot, or, as many do, self-inject it (not happening for me that way, no sir!).  Does that help? Vettegal--was thinking about you today, sister.  I'm so happy that you're still doing okay.  Enjoy the Chinese and keep those se's at bay!!! Today I ran all over the place (I LOVE the feel good days!).  I'm hoping that the 3rd time will be the charm with my glasses rx--I saw my eye doc and then ran the new rx over to LensCrafters to have them make me some new specs.  Unfortunately, they aren't ready in an hour as I've picked out some rimless frames and those have to be sent out, but I should have them in 2 weeks (I tried to push the guy to have them ready by the 8th cuz I told him I'd be in se hell the 9th-11th and would like to be able to see all the tivo'd crap I'd be watching for those days.  He's gonna try.) Then I saw my p/t.  We worked over my pelvis alignment some more and she gave me some exercises to do at home to help with that.  Then I rolled over and got my butt massage.  Hmmmmmm.  Made me drool again. Finally, in between many other errands, I put together and posted a valentine's care package for my college girl.  Made me happy cuz I know she'll be pleased to get it. Now I'm ready to crash!!!  Can't handle as much running around in a day as I used to! Off to make dinner. See yous all later, Jewels. D1",

Do me a favor and give me the details of your tx so I can include you on the Jewel roll call at the header of each page.  Look at other entries to see what we need/want.  If you have specific questions, please ask.  If you need to complain or whine, please do so.  If you want to celebrate, share with us.  We're all here for each other.  I just know you're gonna sparkle and shine with the rest of the Jewels!

Anyhoo, thinking of our newbies, Joan, Judy and Sunshine today.  (Sunshine, when you're feeling up to it, give me your tx info so I can get you in the header.  Thx.) SIS Kimberly--hope you're still on your steroid high today.  The new poem is awesome--as usual (you're spoiling us!).  I went topless yesterday driving around and one of the parents from my kid's bball team passed me on the road and somehow recognized me!  She told me she almost had an accident after she passed me and realized it was me in my balditude!  She told me I rock it (which we all know we do!). KathyL--I sure hope you're able to get on with your good week, now.  No more visits to the hospital, okay? Therese--good to hear from you!  You sound like you're doing well after #2.  I know you're checking in, but be sure you post once in a while so we can keep up with you. Paula--my friend in spasm.  I agree with your theory--I think the spasms are linked to the neulasta.  I'll be curious to hear what your onc has to say.  (As you recall, mine denied that spasms were an se of anything I'm doing and completely invalidated my claim.  Did not make me happy.  Probably why I went on to have a bad reaction to the Taxotere!  All his fault!)  I've had a couple of visits to my heavenly-sent physical therapist and it seems to be helping.  She's given me some stretching to do and then she gives me the most amazing butt massage for about 20 minutes.  She also has me using the heating pad whenever I feel the stress coming on.  I guess it's helping.  I'll only know for sure after the next nasty-lasta.  Do tell what your onc says, tho, I'm VERY interested. CathyCA--interesting about the Claritin 24.  I've already written it on my list of questions for the onc for next time.  Thanks. PALady--so unfair that they moved your date!  It's like no one understands how so much of this journey is mental and then they go and mess that up.  Grr.  Will your 4th date be affected by this?  Let me know so I can get the header right and we think about you on the right day.  Thanks. CHJ--sounds like you're a candidate for the nasty-lasta (my other name for it is f*cking shot).  Better to keep your body on the healthy path.  And hey, there's no rule that you HAVE to have se's from it--look at our pal, LJ13!  I do like the Delmarva theory, but I'm the \"va\" part and look at me!!!!!  Maybe it's the southern thing...  (We're still being punished for the Civil War down here!)  Anyway, CHJ, please rest, take it easy, allow your body to get back on track.  And yes, we are MOST CERTAINLY having fun!!! LJ13--I have to jump on the weight bandwagon and express my jealousy over your teeniness.  I'm 5'9\" and before dx weighed 138 (really, my optimum weight), now I'm 145 (got up to 150 in November!).  I'd really love to lose that last 7 pounds, but can't seem to shake it.  In the meantime, I've had to buy 2 pair of pants to wear as I can no longer zip the ones I wore last winter.  Can I try to send some poundage your way???  (And you sound good, tx#4 is next week, isn't it?  That's the last of this cocktail, right?  What a great milestone for you!!  Cheers!) sista2--Hooray that you got things moving again.  32 oz of apple juice sounds like a nightmare to me, too, but better than the alternative... WVgirl--I'm sorry your dh is being a DH.  I like some of the ideas from KathyL and Paula.  The trouble with mine is that he's the baby of his family and still demands the spotlight.  It's fascinating to watch the dynamic in his family working when they are all together--they all put themselves on the back burner and allow him to glow.  Most times, I'm okay doing that for him, too, as I don't need too much spotlight (I'm the oldest).  I've been trying to be careful not to let the bc be the center of attention and to keep him content by making him feel like he's the most-important thing going on.  I'm actually using some of the techniques KathyL suggested to give him importance when I'm really getting hugs when I need them.  It works.  And I will say the stress of bc DOES have an affect on everyone in the house, whether they admit it, or not (reference Paula's situation).  Fact is, you do need to be cuddled and held, particularly right now, and there's no harm in asking for it.  I'm finding the whole \"I need you\" line works wonders.  Try it.  Maybe your dh just needs to feel he's the center of your universe.   So, I've been reviewing here.  I want to share with everyone my observations of what I did better/worse from tx#1 to tx#2.  Actually, I didn't do much worse.  So here are the improvements I made: -start taking stool softener on tx day and take through day 5 (no constipation issues as a result, but LOTS of stinky gas.  Hmmm.  What's worse???) -start taking Pepcid AC on tx day and take for 2 weeks (no heartburn issues 2nd time around) -swipe nostrils with Q-tips coated with A+D ointment several times every day till dry/bloody nose clears up (more comfort, even tho I still had blood in my mucus when I blew my nose.  Downside is that everything smells of baby diapers!) -added baking soda and water mouth rinses to Biotene regimen (mouth sores were present, but not as much a problem) -went to bed the evening of day 3 and didn't get up till noon on day 6 (okay, I moved down to the sofa to watch tivo'd stuff and took a couple of showers, but the point is, I rested more.  I'm convinced that's why when I got up at noon on day 6, I've been able to keep going.  After tx 1, I had a relapse on days 7+8 because I never really gave in to the whole resting thing.  This round?  No relapse.) I wonder what improvements I'll make for round 3?  Hopefully, no spasms!!!!! Oh, and a hair update.  Stubble consistently falling out of the head.  I do have some hairs that seem to have grown since my shaving (they all appear to be gray ones, so you don't see them).  Those hairs are long enough now that they're soft (think of your legs if you haven't shaved for 2 weeks).  Stray leg and armpit hairs seem to be growing, but I'm not doing anything about them right now.  They're aren't enough to worry about.  Have developed a bald spot on one eyebrow, and notice eyelashes are MUCH thinner.  Oddly, the hair on my arms is intact.  Nails are growing, but VERY slowly.  Shower time drastically reduced!!! Keep shining, Jewels! D1",

Hey CHJ--another baldicious babe!!!  Another one with flat ears--I'm so jealous!  And the wig looks really good.

Laytor,\" \"Anita Coffen,\" and \"Yuri Goner.\"  Much better than the ones you buy and we've used the same graveyard for, hmmm, this is our 15th year!) Anyhoo.  Carol, did you manage to stick around to hear the only good line in the whole debate?  When McCain said if Obama wanted to run against George W. Bush, then he should have run four years ago.  Oh schnap!!!!!!  The rest of it was watching McCain trying to get under Obama's skin and Obama trying to look presidential.  Not one of the better debates, IMO.  I'm all ready to vote, tho (I have a couple of hot issues that are important to me-Supreme Court appointments being my biggie-so it's relatively easy for me to figure out my candidate based on those few things), the debates were not going to change anything for me.  I was just watching for sport.  Oh, college girl.  Yes, she's trying to figure it out, that's for sure.  She called me today between classes to complain about the amount of money the sorority life is costing her.  I didn't bite.  I told her she'll really be motivated to get a job over winter break!  (Mean \u2018ol mom!)  I know, I should be more understanding as she seems to be keeping the academics under control, but that's what she's there for!  I told her to invite her grandparents up to take her out to dinner, they'll probably slip her a $20 (not that it would go far...). I picked up info on yoga today.  Looks like this \"round\" of classes all started mid-September and won't be done till mid-December (these are the ones through the county-price is right).  I'll bet they won't start another round till after the first of the year.  I am going to call the rec center that holds the classes and see if I can sit in on a couple to figure out which one is right for me.  There were probably four in the course book that sounded like beginner level.  So at least I'm starting on that project. I'm probably not the right one to ask about weight-bearing, Carol.  While I did some lifting (perhaps I should put that in quotes-I never used a lot of poundage.  I think even at my peak I was only using 12 lb free weights), before, because of my rotator cuff injury, I've been side-lined.  My p/t does have me using the bands and my surgeon did observe that my back has good def...I attribute that totally to the band exercises I'm doing.  In fact, I have 2 p/t sessions left next week and we're putting together a workout routine designed to keep my rotator cuffs happy and still give me some strength training, so I may not ever go back to the machines.  (I will miss them...)  That said, some type of strength training is critical.  You, in particular, should be interested as the AI will leech your bone density and the strength training will help you combat that.  I'm not sure what kind of routine you should do, but if you have free weights, some curls for your biceps (start low and work your way up-I mean, start at like 3 lbs), light weights at your sides with your shoulder blades pushed together and pelvis tucked and lift your arms straight out to the sides for 10, then straight forward for 10, then repeat (don't lift your arms up higher than your shoulders), um, heavier weights held at your sides and \"walk\" 10-15  steps one direction lunging so your back knee almost touches the floor with each step.  Reps are more important than pounds.  My descriptions are lame.  Sorry.  But if you can figure out what I mean, at least it's a start. Hope Sylvan was okay.  I know what you mean about 5 and 3 year olds.  I loved it then because I still walked on water... I saw that about Julie's 6 acres, too!  That's a lot of grass clippings, Julie! Oh, there's LJ with some weight ideas.  And she's right, the le is a risk with repetitive stuff.  I'm supposed to break up my lifting routines, much like LJ describes, but I just alternate lower strengthening and then upper strengthening to keep from doing too much at once.  And I agree, once you can do 15 reps 2x comfortably, then increase the weight and then move back to 8 reps and work your way up to 15 again.  Once you get to 10-12 pounds, though, I think I'd stick there. Sounds like you had a similar reaction to the debate, Deb.  There must be a reason that campaign after campaign we get these same debates where you don't learn too much about the candidates.  Maybe we Americans are dumber than we think we are and the handlers know just how to feed us our information... (Try Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert-they've got the issues!  Jk-although I watch regularly.  Sunday talk shows are pretty good for filling in some of the details.) Not dealing with much neuropathy anymore-well, the tips of my toes are still numb, but it doesn't seem to bother me too much.  So I can't help you there. Hey, if you want the FUBC license plate-go for it!  It'd be great to know that my sister in Arkansas is \"driving\" the same message home! Carol, you hit the nail on the head.  (I'm so full of puns today!)  Your mind was in game mode when you were training for your 3day.  Now just wrap your head around your new regimen and be as committed to that. OMG, CHJ!  I think our oncs are related!  I told him about the nightly drenchings (I get them during the day, sometimes, too) and he just blew them off.  He did suggest that I take vit e and oil of evening primrose 2x a day to help the hot flashes, but I'm not convinced it's doing anything. I did the BRCA1&2 testing this fall.  I probably wouldn't have done it, but I'm participating in all of these studies at Georgetown and one of them deals with genetic counseling/testing.  Since I've met my deductible for the year, I figured, why not?  All my stuff came back negative, but I'm hoping that doesn't change my level of care going forward.  I guess it's a good thing for my daughters that I'm negative, but from what I understand, it doesn't much help my sisters.  About the only thing that would have come out of being positive is the whole ovary thing, but I'm not sure what I would have done about it. The testing's got to be easier than a root canal/colonoscopy...  (you've got it coming and going, don't you!) Carla-mani/pedi, good for you!  (I've become such a sucker for that girlie stuff.)  And so many of us looking in to yoga! LJ/CHJ-you guys crack me up with your Komen planning! Okay, off to check on the graveyard... D1",

Bad news today, when I went in for my physical therapy, I had my therapist feel the date-sized lump that has mysteriously appeared in my armpit and the fluidy buildup on my shoulder blade (unfortunately, this is accompanied by soreness--just what any of us needs!).  She thinks it might be lymphodema!  Sh*t!!!  I'm supposed to call my surgeon to see what he thinks.  Guess I'll be dealing with that in 10 days or so... Shout out time to my Jewelie gems: Deb--you feeling better?  It seems we got nailed with se's this past week. Julie--it makes me sad to hear that you're having such trouble with the vomiting.  It sounds like you're taking a lot of meds to combat it.  Should you be talking to your doc about diet (maybe you're eating something that doesn't sit well), or vitamins you're taking?  In this day and age, there is no excuse for you to be sick.  And maybe it's the stress trying to keep up with your job and a break is just what you need (I just hope the finances work out for you).  Oh, and I just drove my kid to catch her bus to her game and realized as I pulled in behind the bus, where her coaches and teammates rushed the car to welcome her, that I had gone out topless!!!  My dd prefers that I wear a wig around her peers so I look \"normal.\"  Oops.  Well, the cat's outta the bag now!  :) AZDonna--send that dh my way!!!  How good of him to realize that your last tx kicked your butt and that you needed some help around the house.  Hooray for him!!! You're sounding good, Vettegal!  Keep it up. Carol--I'm joining you in the chemo lounge tomorrow, so won't likely get a check off for a few days, but I'll do it as soon as I can.  Thanks. SIS Kimberly--a red wig sounds divine!!!  Can you tolerate the wigs okay?  I thought I wanted a couple for different looks, but I hate wearing the one I have so much that I know it would be stupid of me to spend money on that.  I'm really into the whole scarf thing.  But you go, girl!  And keep feeling good, there are a bunch of us hitting the bar this week and we're all going to need you when those se's come knocking! PALady--yay on getting the tx moved back!!!  How sick are we that we celebrate such things???!! Gotta go down a glass of wine before my kid's game--helps with the stress of sitting there, waiting for her to get in!  Only 1 more liter of water to drink tonight before I reach my goal.  Then 3 more tomorrow morning and those veins oughta be plump (I'll be peeing all day, that's for sure!)! Oh, need to dig up my cape!  I'm wearing my FUBC shirt tomorrow (with my new bra).  I'm going to be the hottest gal in the lounge, I'm just feeling it!!! Good luck to all of us tomorrow!  Till after tx!  D1",

On top of all this, I've been calling my med team this week to make sure everything is set for my rad onc checkup the day after I return and come to find out, they needed me to have my MRI BEFORE I went in for that appointment, so they can talk about the pictures with me when I go.  So, I had to rush in at 5:45AM for my MRI yesterday.  I was yanking on my big girl panties BIG TIME, Carol, as they could not get the IV in for the contrast.  My hand is all black and blue and swollen today.  It even hurts a little to type (maybe I should pour me a drink to alleviate that pain...).  I was so stressed out by the experience that I gave myself diarrhea (who said it's not mind over matter??).  That was fun having me race off to the bathroom just as they were going to put me in the MRI machine.  (This bc stuff is still a laugh a minute!)  I won't know what they saw on the MRI till I get home. I did finish up p/t for my rotator cuff this week.  I'm not sure I'm really ready to be sprung, but I have a list of exercises and my therapist gave me her email so I can check in with her in six weeks for the next set she wants me to do.  She said that if in 8-10 weeks I'm still having the pain that I should get a new script from one of my docs and start another round of p/t.  I'm kinda hoping that the exercises and the massage therapy (if my onc would ever call me back to give me a script for that!), will take care of it.  Massages sound much better to me than p/t. Are you guys tired of reading about me?  Let's see what you all are up to. Carol, thanks for the ringy dingy.  I'm sorry I missed you.  You're always a mood brightener.  It sounds like the ds losing his wallet was a \"found\" opportunity for you!  How cool to reconnect with an old friend!  (And how great that the wallet was found right away.) I leave for my trip in the morning, Julie.  I return on November 2.  It will take us all day to get to the island tomorrow.  Then we get up on Sunday and do our grocery shopping and drive about 4 hours to the other end of the island to the house we've rented.  Luckily, the two libraries we're working in this time are only about 45 minutes apart, so our house is kinda in the middle.  That way we won't have to move during the week.  When we're done working next Friday, we're going to drive back up the island about 3 hours and visit our old family friends, who live there.  Then on Saturday, we're going to drive the rest of the way toward the airport (in fact, about a half hour past it) and spend the day on a cay there.  We'll take a water taxi to get to the cay.  This is our day to kick back.  Then early on Sunday, we start the process of returning to our homes, which will take the entire day.  I think I get in to the DC area at 8pm.  I'm really looking forward to this (even though my sister sent the work schedule and we start at 8am every day, but should get out at 5pm-plenty early enough to get in to trouble!). It's a good thing you and your dh ironed out the school situation BEFORE you moved!  It sounds like your ds is doing well this year and I can completely understand that you would want to get him in an academic environment that would continue to encourage him.  Oh, and don't worry about the decorations-we don't have a pumpkin, yet! (And now it's not my problem!) Good to hear from you KathyL!  How cool that the dd's picture was chosen.  I remember my own college girl was honored in the same fashion many, many years ago.  I never did see that picture, but people told me they saw it in the Ed building, and then in a local mall when they did the display there.  I hope you're a better mother than I and get a chance to oogle her talent.  Happy 3rd b-day to the ds!  Ages 3 and 8 were my favorite years.  Have a great partay! Don't you hate those tests that require fasting, Carol?  I can go without food on any given day, but if you tell me that I CAN'T eat, then I'm starving!  Hope it all went well (I don't know what half those tests are for, either, so don't feel bad).  Keep up the exercise (I'm jealous of the yoga-looks like that waits till after the first of the year for me), eating fish, and drinking wine excessively!  (Oops, that last one is me, I think.) Okay, I'm off to the Caribbean!  Cross your fingers that there are no hurricanes.  I'll pop in if I can find a computer with internet access. Shine on you crazy Jewels! D1",

      "Content": "Nov 13, 2008 04:05PM Determined1 wrote: Has it been since Monday that I've posted?  Time flies! Well, college girl's news was that she has a boyfriend (she's almost 20 and this is her first one).  Unfortunately, it's not the guy I would have picked for her.  She's known this guy since they were in 6th grade together and he hasn't always been a good friend.  She's always had a crush on him and I know they've hooked up (I think I'm using that right) on and off since they were freshmen in high school (much to my dismay).  I know she's always held a candle for this kid (part of me thinks it has something to do with how women form emotional attachments once we establish physical attachments, but that's probably too heavy to discuss here), but he has been emotionally abusive to her over the years.  She acknowledged that he probably isn't the guy dh or I would have picked for her, but she says he's changed (oh yeah, heard that one before).  She would like to invite him to dinner at the house over the Thanksgiving break, so I'll be on my best behavior.  (Is it time for me to mention that this kid did well in high school, but dropped out of college after the freshman year?  Now he's thinking about attending community college in South Carolina, where his mother recently relocated.  I can already see my college girl dumping her prestigious college to follow this kid...)  What a rant!  Hopefully, this will allow me to behave myself around my daughter and her, swallow hard, boyfriend. License plate options.  Love your idea, LJ, but there's already someone driving around my town with that one!  And BC SUX would have the same problem as FUBC, I'm afraid.  So here are my ideas: DTRMD1 D-WON BP1BC0 (BP are my real initials) FU1BC0 What do you guys think? LJ, thanks a million for the weight videos-it's hard to misunderstand how to do the exercise when you watch someone do it correctly.  I can see that many of them will do the same thing as my bands, so when I graduate from the bands, I imagine I'll be substituting these.  If you find some more, send them on-new ideas are always welcome. Carol, I read about your visit with Baby Katie with a big smile on my face because it wasn't clear to me who drank the 4oz and then experienced the big burp!!!  Glad you had a good time.  You look fabulous in the photo.  I think your hair may be thickening up again.  Oh, and the baby is really cute. Your sleeve should not be cutting off circulation to your fingers.  When I fly I wear my sleeve and a gauntlet (glove w/o fingers) to keep the compression from sending fluid into my hand.  I don't have to wear the gauntlet every day, tho.  Something about the pressurization when you fly that I need it then.  Try this:  put your sleeve on.  If your skin bulges at the upper arm or wrist around the edge of the sleeve, then it's probably too tight.  Didn't you see a le therapist for an evaluation?  If so, call her and ask if you can pop by between her appointments to show her your sleeve so she can give you some guidance.  My experience with those folks is that they're willing to come out for a few minutes to talk, even if you don't have an appointment. Hope the weather is okay for you.  The forecaster here keeps talking about your rain... Oh man, SISKimberly, I'm so sorry your students are disappointing you.  That would be hard for me to take-putting in all that effort, only to have it fall on deaf ears.  I hope those kids wake up soon and realize that you're one of the best things to ever happen to them!  (Sounds like the weekend getaway was good for recharging the \u2018ol batteries!) For crying out loud, Carol, what's up with your \"whore moans?\"  I know what you mean about the emotions being right there.  As you'll recall, I'm not a crier and since I've been on the Tamoxifen it seems a cry is just around the corner.  Maybe your AI is messing with you.  (Is everything okay with the ds?) Hey, Happy Birthday, Carla!!!  I just sang for you at my computer (and you can thank your lucky stars that you couldn't hear it!). Take care, gang. D1",

I guess you're going to be seeing your surgeon tomorrow.  I'll be sending all my very best your way.  Be strong, and like Carol says, stay optimistic.  You've got the sparkle of the Jewels on your side. CHJ-I'll bet you're a little shaky about your mammo/MRI.  Hold your head up and march on in there.  Don't second guess any decisions you've made along the way-you made them when they were the best options at the time.  You're going to be great, I can just tell.  (Weather cold enough for you?) LWDana-Glad to have you back.  It sounds like your cruise was just the ticket-despite the fact you had to dress for dinner.  I know what you mean about wanting to call your dad.  Mine died seven years ago and I talk to him all the time.  You have to know he's there for you-and will probably do a better job parenting with the advantage of hindsight.  Don't ever give up on him.  As for your family, be gracious, but firm.  Family is a tough nut sometimes.  But you have to look out for LW (who will find a way to prepare for those exams-you always amaze).  Oh, and it's so unfair that you didn't gain any weight on your cruise-you put me in an environment with that much rich food and it's a disaster waiting to happen. So I went to my gentle yoga trial today.  I LOVED it.  This would have never been my schtick a year ago, but I'm a little different now.  I'm going to call the coordinator tomorrow to see if my friend and I can pay a prorated amount for the remaining three classes in this session, rather than waiting till Jan. 21 (day after inauguration!!!!!) to start the new session. Oh, and I made the first call to a therapist.  It led to a list of referrals since the doc I was calling was not accepting new patients.  So I made the call to a LCSW on the list since it's a woman and she deals with relationship issues (which I believe is the crux of my bad feelings).  I'm a little anxious awaiting her return call as it means I'll have to start actually spilling some beans, but I can do it.  I know you guys are all cheering me on and it helps more than you'll ever know (and if you're not cheering me on, you should.) Carol, have a good trip and I hope some golf is in the cards for you. Onward. D1",

First off, I want to acknowledge how positive Kris is being.  It makes me happy to see you making an informed decision for yourself and taking action.  I hope I can handle the next hurdle that comes my way with your WTF attitude.  You go, girl! Secondly, CathyCA, you must think I'm a complete dolt.  For some reason, I thought your 3 day was LAST weekend!  And I'm sitting here, waiting for the report.  So, enjoy your walk and allow yourself to celebrate that you're walking a 3day this year, rather than what you were doing last year.  You've come a long way, baby. (I don't know about the Bioelectric Impedance Analysis-have to tried posting the question over on the Lymphedema discussion?  There are a couple of women there who seem to have heard of everything...) It sounds like you guys are getting a lot of snow, Carla.  Hope you're prepared for it.  You, too, sound like you have a game plan for your upcoming tests (the snow better melt so you can get to your appointments w/o hassle!).  Fingers are crossed that everything will be okay. Shouts to Carol on her cation!  I hope your golf swing is unaffected by the port removal (or if you completely suck, blame it on your de-porting), and that you get that water boob out for a swim!  Continue to enjoy and libate! (Is that a word???) I have a question for anyone who has done therapy.  I went for a consult with the LCSW and came away feeling like I hadn't accomplished anything.  I mean, I laid out my issues and asked her suggestions on how to ameliorate them and she had nothing for me.  She pretty much said she's a safe place to talk things out (which is good for me, since I've had this stuff bottled up for years, but I want resolution!).  Am I expecting too much from this?  Does one get resolution by going to therapy?  Should I shop around-or do you have to give it a chance to be effective?  Sorry so many questions, but I'm thinking electro-shock therapy might be a better answer for me... Anyhoo, I want to move my laundry around before I head out to pick up my dd from school (she couldn't get up early enough to drive herself today, poor baby). Happy Friday, everyone! D1",

Yes, Carol, I got a card from Tina.  And from several other Jewels-thanks gang.  My dh will look at them at say, who's WVgirl?  Who's She-she?  I think he's finally figuring out that we're all including our screen names in our cards so we know who they're from!  (And he's jealous that I'm getting so many cards this year, he he.) Dd is really over Vassar (I was surprised at how quickly she moved on).  It helped that yesterday she heard from Lewis & Clark in Portland, OR, that she has been accepted.  They've even offered her a renewable $8500 annual scholarship for her community service record (I KNEW there was a reason I made my kids do community service-my older daughter was granted a scholarship to one school acknowledging her service, too).  L&C was her safety school, so now she's more relaxed and is moving on to the next round of schools.  She applied to Wesleyan University in CT yesterday (this is her 2nd choice).  Next up is Pomona College in CA (#3), Emerson College in Boston, and Occidental College in LA.  All of these deadlines are right around Jan. 1, so she spent yesterday working on the essays for their supplements.  I think there will be another batch that will go out for Jan. 15 deadlines, but that list seems to be fairly fluid right now.  The good news is, she WILL go to college! The Megace seems only to give me the jitters.  I haven't noticed any relief from the hot flashes, but I did sleep through the night last night without an Ambien, so I'm interested to try again tonight to see what happens.  My mood is a bit cheerier, but I'm not sure if it's the drug or the fact that it's almost Christmas.  I really hate all the pills I take, though.  I think once I run out of the herbal supplements I'm on to help with the hot flashes, I won't replenish.  They're not helping, anyway. I got my duck's ass clipped off the other day, Kris.  In fact, my gal trimmed it up pretty short as we're trying to camouflage the fact that I have several areas that aren't growing in at all (thank you Tamox!).  Not to mention the fact that this new hair has absolutely no body (where are the curls that were advertised as a benefit of chemo??) and is baby, baby fine, so it resists attempts at styling.  Guess I'll just have really short hair for a few more years... Hang in there with the drains, gf.  I know I've said it before, but they could be helping you avoid some more serious complications down the road... Joan, I'm so sorry to hear about your mom.  I know she's been ill for a while, so her peace must be comforting for you.  I know having family around for the holiday will be a challenge,  but with your mom's passing, it will undoubtedly be nice to be surrounded by so much love. I, too, am disappointed in Vassar.  I was excited about the prospect of visiting with you and Maz occasionally.  We'll have to catch up at our reunion.  And Las Vegas?  What about that, Jewels???? I'm jealous that you were able to get your stuff mailed out, CHJ.  I went to the post office yesterday to find a line that some were saying was an hour and a half long!  Since I was just mailing out my international cards, I walked out.  I figured they'll be just as happy to get a card from me AFTER Christmas.  Now there's the bah-humbug spirit!!! Nicely said, LJ. Dang, Carla, be more careful on the stairs, girl!  And what a great message from your customer.  That would be all I'd need for Christmas (plus all the material shit on my list...). I'm feeling caught up-oh, other than to tell my SP that I started spending the iTunes money.  I bought a few Melissa Etheridge songs to round out my collection.  Thanks!!!! Happy last few shopping days...  (I don't think any Jewels celebrate Hanukkah, do they?  If I'm missing someone, Happy Hanukkah!) D1",

Carol, thanks for the new year wishes, I missed you by 20 minutes.  I would have rung you right back, but dd injured her finger at the game last night (she played awesome) and I was waiting a call from dh about her xray (we thought it was broken).  Turns out no fractures, but the darn thing is bruised into her palm.  She has no practice tomorrow and we're hoping she can just run with the team on Friday (no ball handling).  It's so funny, she kept playing with her injury while players who usually get to play all the time head to the bench crying when they take an elbow or something less.  I have to respect that my kids keep persevering.  College girl broke her hand her high school sophomore year, the first game in which she'd earned a starting position, and kept playing with her broken hand until the pain was so great that she couldn't handle the ball any longer.  I wouldn't be able to do the same... I'm moving on without the Megace.  Already I notice that my heart rate has improved, but I didn't sleep a wink last night and stayed in bed till 9am today.  I guess I'll have to go back to the Ambien.  Based on what I'm reading here, my time with the Tamox is somewhat limited...  I truly am hating what it does to me, I'm just trying to take it because I know it's so effective against recurrence.  (What am I afraid of-cancer????)  Fuck.

WVgirl--wow!  What a scary experience.  When I'm having my dead ache bone pain after tx I walk around holding on to whatever I can find because I'm not sure my legs can really hold me.  I think they should issue all of us walkers with those tennis balls on the bottom for chemo!  Please take care of yourself. KathyL--Tea tree oil, huh?  I'll have to see if I can pick some up tomorrow (hope it doesn't stink too, too badly...)  Already use OPI products on my toes, so I guess they're covered (bad pun, sorry). Carol, you social butterfly, you!  Sounds like the golfing was divine.  I'm so happy for you that your se's are minimal.  It's nice to have someone who stays sane around here! Deb, I'm so sorry about your tooth.  It seems to me someone around here did have a root canal or something.  I can't remember who, though.  Hopefully, they'll pop in soon with their details.  Please try to stay comfortable. Sheshe--it does sound like time to make a change.  Stick to your guns.  Let us know when you get all your new dates straightened out so we can get you updated in the header.  We want to think about you in your new happy, infusion center. CarolC--the neuropathy is a pain, isn't it?  Mine is still only in my lower arms and hands, and now almost only on the left side.  I just can't imagine it in the feet!  It does sound like you're coming down with something and I hope you've contacted your doc by now.  I also have blood in my nose (not a bloody nose, but when I blow, blood clots spew out--okay, that was gross).  It seems to be worse when my nose gets dry (I have dryness issues as an se).  I Q-tip my nostrils with A+D ointment several times a day to combat the dryness.  That hasn't alleviated the blood, but I don't have the discomfort and right now, that's all I care about.  Not sure if that applies to you, but there you go. Fingers are crossed for a good MRI for Dana!! Paula--yeah, the fatigue does get worse, doesn't it?  My dh came into the family room the other day and caught me just sitting and staring into space.  I told him I do that several times a day now, just to give myself a chance to recharge.  Take care of that cough--seems like you've had it long enough now that it needs to move on! LJ13--as one of our AC experts, you did a fabulous job with your account for Kalen.  Thanks for taking the time to be so thorough. Kalen--I'm not on AC, but I'll add some tips for se's.  Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash (found at Target) are good for helping with mouthsores.  I also added a mix of baking soda and water (I don't measure, just dump) which seems to really help that, too.  I'm one of the few here that uses Colace to combat constipation, which I start the day I have my infusion and take it till the day after I take the last of my steroids (Decadron) for that infusion.  Gives me awful gas (I just started taking GasX this last treatment to help with that), but I haven't been constipated.  I also have horrible issues with heartburn, so I take Pepcid AC from the day of infusion for about 2 weeks.  You saw earlier in this post about my use of A+D ointment (only downside is that you smell baby diaper smell all the time!).  Also, have a good lip balm and body lotion around--dryness stinks!  If you have other questions, please don't hesitate! Mom2daughters--I had my last lumpectomy/anxially node dissection October 15 and didn't start chemo till December 27 (sought several opinions and waited on my oncotype score).  No one seemed upset by the passage of time (except maybe me). Okay, I saw my lymphedema specialist today.  She's a sweetie.  She taught me all about le and gave me a huge list of do's and don't's (okay, that was sobering).  She measured my arms and said I already have some signs of le, so she's going to fit me for a sleeve and more importantly, teach me how to massage myself to keep le at bay.  I'm supposed to try to convince the dh to come in and learn the massage techniques, too, so he can do the part I'll need on my back (I have a pool of fluid on my shoulder blade).  Eventually, we'll also talk about bras (I have one c cup and one b cup now and my bras tend to twist around during the day--even my new Victoria's Secret one, which has me a little bummed).  Hopefully, she'll be able to help me get a better fit (or maybe I'll get my c cup reduced so they match, but that's more surgery--yuck).  I have 3 more appointments with her and we'll schedule more if I need them.  Between that and physical therapy and my other doctor appointments, it seems all I do is see specialists! Well, I did find time to swing by my hairdressers to see if she could do anything about my wig.  She tried trimming it a little to give it more natural movement, but she couldn't do anything about the clumps of hair on the sides that make me crazy (they're the result of the alterations I had to have on my wig so it would fit me).  BUT the good news is that she's happy with the fuzz I'm growing and suggested that I make a hair appointment for the end of March!!!!  You guys, I was dancing in the salon I was so excited to make a hair appointment!  She said I could move it back if my hair slows down, but she thinks I might have a half an inch by then!!!!  Oh boy, oh boy!!  (I am so UNBELIEVEABLY simple, aren't I???) Happy day, Jewels! D1",

Kris60--those pains sure sound like the neulasta nasties to me.  I take Maximum Strength Tylenol (rapid release) every 5-6 hours till I take a Tylenol PM before bed (you'll wake up in the night and need that next max str ty 5-6 hours later, so have it on the nightstand with some water).  When I'm out of bed, I use a heating pad and move it around to my trouble spots to try to keep it relaxed.  Do your best not to move around much (I find even going to the toilet throws my back into spasms) for a day or so till it passes.  It will pass, but you'll curse every minute of it (at least I do). Sheshe--you ARE from Michigan!!  Vernors!!  I grew up in Flint and have had to search high and low to find Vernors here in Virginia.  It's the only thing to drink when you're not quite right.  The wedding plans sound great.  It's been a long time since I've been close to that excitement. WVGirl--Darn that DH!!!!  Sounds to me like HE's the one feeling attention-deprived. SIS Kimberly--You had me LOL with the floating hoot in the hot tub story!  Keep smiling and don't let those se's get you down. Congratulations, KathyL and dd!!  The Big K is a VERY big deal.  (Hope the dd stays pumped about it as reality sets in this fall...)  :) OMG, Carol--that gigantic hoot was as large as your entire torso!!!  It would make for an interesting hoot-clops look, doncha think?  Your final results look FABULOUS!  You gotta be feeling good about it.  And it sounds like you had a lot of fun to boot.  Thanks a bunch for the pics--you look great!  (Oh, got my new shirt yesterday--thanks!) Bummer.  I checked with DMV here to see if I could get FUBC license plates and it's already taken (some poseur).  I can also use the special characters \"space,\" \"-,\" and \"&.\"  But every combination I tried with FUBC was taken.  Does anyone have any ideas on how I can get FUBC across on my license plate (I get 6 characters)?  I'm so disappointed... Good luck tomorrow TinaLee and JackieB (hey, that rhymes!) and Sunshine99.  Please send your bar tab to your insurance companies!  Bottoms up! D1 Paula, you must've posted while I was in composition mode.  You sound good.  Yay!!",

Speaking of crying, my SP sent the most sensitive figurine.  It's an angel depicting courage-something I need right now.  I have her on my desk and can see her while I type.  Thank you, SP. Oh Carol, if you like reruns, you'd fit right in around here.  We have watched every season of Entourage, in order, several times.  It's getting to the point that even I can quote the lines!  Nothing wrong with backtracking a little with Grey's... So I was thinking about Paula and dh all day today.  Gosh I hope there's some good news for them! Geez, Carol, does ds know you're sharing his potty training experiences here???  (Although congrats to KathyL's ds-who is age appropriate to have his bathroom habits discussed here-I hope the streak continues!) I dunno, I like the wine cooler in the living room-why would you want to go in to the laundry room for some vino, only to be reminded of that chore? Yeah, I liked SISKimberly's interpretation of Paula's dream, too.  Some of it even sounded plausible.  I'm still waiting to hear what she says about Cher. You know, I had the same reaction to getting my feeling back.  While I'm impatient, the fact that there's still some hope out there is so encouraging. I'll tell you what, if I were a skier, Tina, I'd do it your way!  (An afternoon sipping hot toddies-no hot tubs for me anymore, thanks le-sounds mighty fine.) Therese-thanks for the encouragement on LV, but I'm BUMMED that you saw Elton John!  I was hoping I could convince a group to take in his show.  I absolutely LOVED him from about 1973-1980.  I've heard he gives a great show.  Someday... Oh yes, I need to send a WOOOHOOO to CHJ and one to Patty for their team's performances this weekend.  Can someone PLEASE beat the Eagles???? Carol-put my name on that list!!!! Oh, Patty, I will sit by the pool with you.  I don't gamble a lot (I set myself a limit), but I love the sun (I know, we've gone over this before...).  Does Planet Hollywood have a gym?  I can't imagine not. How can your dh be making advances while watching football, KathyL?  Does a 1st down make him amorous??? Paula.  Yes, FUBC.  I'm sorry to hear about dh's tumors.  It must be so frustrating for him with communication difficulties.  My dad did have several strokes which affected his speech and he was always such a good sport about it-I'd have a hard time with that.  I can imagine that you're good at interpreting his thoughts-you guys were probably finishing one another's sentences years ago and didn't even realize it.  Yes, his sister coming in is a good thing.  You should talk to him about having folks check in.  If you tell him part of it is your peace of mind, he probably won't resist as much.  Be sure you take care of yourself, too. Hmm, how old is the dd again?  My girls are not well-endowed, so a revealing dress has never been a problem here.  But I must say I'd be cringing until they reach a certain age. I can't imagine a Jewel Reunion without you, Paula.  You are an inspiration each and every day. Patty, there was a bit in the NYTimes Travel section this weekend about how Las Vegas was a good deal right now. GREAT pics!  Thanks for sharing!  Is that handsome guy in the pictures Vetteguy, or did you pick up some hot California model to hang with???? Yep, Julie, right on.  We got ourselves an old-fashioned SMACK DOWN!!!  What fun!!! I have my sonogram in the morning.  While I don't expect any bad news I can't help the uugy feeling in the pit of my stomach... D1",

College girl goes back to school in a week.  Ten days ago I would have told you I couldn't wait for her to go back, but now that it's nearing, I'm kinda sad to see her go.  I don't know what I'll do next year when both of them are gone! Patty, I LOVE your new year's resolutions!  Nothing like aiming high!  And I like how some of them are totally out of your control!  You make me smile. How great to hear from you Wendy!!!  Every Jewel is invited to our little soiree-the more the merrier!  Stop in often so you can keep up with the planning. As for anti-depressants, it depresses me just to think I'm taking one.  I've always been a pretty sunny person, but the tamox is kicking my moody butt.  You probably saw LJ's research that showed anti-depressants can diminish the effectiveness of tamox, so check with your onc about that (I can't remember if you're taking tamox, or not).  This whole journey is changing my opinions about a lot of things, including the fact that I have to be open-minded about trying different things that may help me in the end.  I hope you get some help for your blues. Hip Hooray to CathyCA for finishing her tx!!!!!!  And now another Jewel is about to be deported! And more good news from Joan on her mammo and check-up!  I'll bet the onc visit goes just as smoothly. Carol, you're so funny.  I haven't even looked at anything on Vegas, yet.  Bummer about Elton John.  I've told the dh if EJ or Fleetwood Mac ever crosses the radar screen that those concerts are on my bucket list (I managed to get to a Roger Waters-Pink Floyd-show a couple of years ago, another one on my list).  And I see the Eagles every chance I get.  I will say Bette Midler is a scream in concert!  I busted a gut laughing so hard.  And Cher would be good-particularly since she and I are already linked in dreamland. Paula and Ed are likely enroute to Duke right now.  Paula, we're all vibing just as furiously as we can.  Tell dh that we're pulling for him and are all proud of how both of you are handling all the obstacles in your way. Did you slip the gal at Boston Market a buck or two for the compliment, Patty?  Sometimes those come at just the right times, don't they? I have to prep my dinner so I can throw it together before dd's game tonight.  Later. D1",

We have .25\" of ice on everything here, but I still have my electricity, thank goodness!!  No school today, so the dd and I are chillin' in front of our computers.  Dh returns from a biz trip to CA tonight, I'm hoping everythings clears off so he can land. CHJ--you're certainly getting it from all sides, aren't you?  I think the onc is making you sick!  You need a new one.  (I blame all the negs in this experience on my onc--I just need a scapegoat.)  Seriously, it's a long-term relationship and you need to have 100% confidence in your onc.  Maybe start nosing around to see what else is out there. Deb--I'm sorry to read about your dp's mom.  Neither of you needs the additional emotional whammy of coping with the death of a parent right now.  I'll hope for a peaceful end, then you and dp can celebrate her life. Julie--HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!  (I celebrated mine a week after the fact--spreads it out!)  Just get that vomitus under control--wouldn't that be the best gift???? Kris--you're at work??  I hope, hope, hope that means your back is feeling better... Carol--the compression garment she thinks I'll need looks like the kind of bra your grandma wore (slap in the face to someone who just turned 50, if you ask me).  It would cover my shoulder blades and extend down my torso as far as needed to compress the areas affected.  It would be fitted to me ($$$$).  It would be in addition to my sleeve.  Basically, I'll just be running around like a stuffed sausage... Well, the dd did not get into the game last night.  They lost.  Just desserts, if you ask me (no, I'm not bitter).  They have still qualified for the Regional Tournament, so they have another game on Monday night.  Hopefully, they'll lose that one and this season will be over (don't tell her coach this is my attitude).  Luckily, dd has AAU tryouts on Sunday and if she gets the same coach she had last year, he'll work on rebuilding her confidence and has said he wants to give her lots of playing time.  I hope we can keep him to his word... (For those of you who don't know, AAU is pretty intense.  Practices during the week and then 4 games every weekend from March till July.  Parents basically give up on laundry and mowing the lawn.  But your kid has a chance to play against some of the best players in the region.  Our club travels all up and down the mid-Atlantic entering tournaments, so it's fun for the kids.)

I do have a question from your post, KathyL.  You mentioned something about cording.  After my arm snapped, I had these two sinewy things running from my pit to about halfway to my elbow.  I thought they were ligaments or something, but I could feel them easily through my skin (noticed them because my reaction after the snap was to rub where the snap occurred).  I'm noticing now that the pain in my arm is where those sinewy things were (but they appear to be gone, or are deep in my scrawny arm).  Is that cording?  And could that be a positive for me?  I have an appointment with my le massage therapist tomorrow morning and you best believe I'll be working her over with a million and one questions. Oh, you can add me to the non-reading group.  I'm trying to read, but can't focus.  I, too, have switched to magazines for the time being... Julie--loved the pic with the cake!  So glad you waited till you could taste it.  And I love the idea of a birthday year.  My mom's birthday is at the end of March and when we were growing up she always celebrated for the entire month, calling it her birthday month.  Got us to do all kinds of annual chores around the house while she was celebrating.  I hope you celebrate each and every day for the rest of the year!  You deserve it! Therese--I can't imagine what's going through your head as you near Friday.  I completely understand the feelings of being cut loose and wondering if you're ready.  This journey requires so much from each of us that nearing the end doesn't seem possible.  But if your med team says you're ready to roll, then you are.  Smile and hold your head up--you beat cancer!!!! Carol--I'm so excited for your ds!!  It's payoffs like that that keep kids focused on trying again and again.  You all deserve to celebrate!  Yeah, Vassar is a pricey place (but a good school).  Our kids have taken our oath that they could go to school whereever they want and we'll figure out how to pay for it to heart.  It would be good to get some help through the basketball, but this kid is really smart, too, so maybe she can get some $$ for her grades.  She's only a junior, so we do have some time to get film, it just would've been nice to have it in hand when we take her to visit over the summer.  It's possible we can get some film from AAU--we'll have to see how that all pans out.  She had tryouts yesty and there were only 7 girls in her age group.  Apparently, there are a bunch from one school that had playoff games yesterday, so they couldn't make tryouts, but they need at least 10 to field a team.  One good thing is, with so few girls on the team, she'll get a lot of time!  :) Paula--a skiing trip sounds like exactly the right thing to do.  You must be very proud of your ds. KathyL--so glad your dad is doing well.  It's great that he and your stepmom were able to visit when you were having a good weekend.  Did the ds and the potty have a good weekend, too?  (And you know, you go right from talking about potty training to thinking about college--it goes fast, don't blink!!) So how's last week's tx team doing?  I hope the se's are manageable.  Remember, they will pass--good days are coming again!! Good luck tomorrow to Kris (I hope that fajita was yum, yum, yum!).  Go kick some cancer *ss!!!!!! D1",

Congrats to Patty and her Steelers!!  They look pretty tough (since the Vikes are NFC, I don't watch a lot of AFC teams during the regular season, so yesty was my first good look).  Condolences to CHJ and LJ...  But I'm ready, bring on the Super Bowl!!! Who on earth can hook a bra behind her back????  I'm in the group that hooks in the front and then twists it around to tuck the girls inside.  Course, I don't wear a real bra much anymore and my compression garment (aka the Big Bra) is so big it has a zipper closure!!! Sherry, I'm glad you can get away to watch the inauguration.  And Carol, yep, set the Tivo.  I can't imagine he'll talk more than 30 minutes and the ceremony is to start at noon, so I don't think it will be drawn out (could be wrong...).  I just want to be a part of it.  I liked what SISKimberly had to say about diversity and feel this guy could be a turning point for America.  I sure hope so, we need a turning point on so many fronts in this country right now that I can't even begin to list all of them!  With all the walking I'll do tomorrow, maybe I could consider it training for a 3-day!!!!! I was thinking of dropping by the hospital today for a colostomy bag for tomorrow, CHJ! Hip hooray that the new onc is working out!  I really liked my onc early on, but once we got going I found him to be inconsistent with the level of attention he gives me.  I know he's human and can often be affected by whatever happened in the exam before mine, but I was hoping for more of a warm, fuzzy relationship.  I guess that's why I'm gravitating back to my gyn, who's been with me for almost 30 years.  (I'm not liking him when he suggests that some things are happening to me because I'm getting old, tho!) Oh, and I second SISKim's bummer to LJ.  Would love the chance to meet you, but understand your feelings toward Vegas.  I've been there three times, I think, and while it's not one of my favorite destinations, I do try to suspend belief and enjoy the spectacle.  You can't get it anywhere else. I'm glad to see your family is going to be retested for BRCA, SISKim.  It's hard to believe with your family history that the bc you're all experiencing is just bad luck of the draw.  I know that's possible, but I think it's prudent to be rechecked so you can all make better screening choices. How was Gran Torino, Julie? Oh gosh, I just got an email from one of the coaches about the Senior Night plans.  I guess I should get on that. Not sure when I'll have a chance for the post-inaugural report, but as soon as I can, I'll be on with the details! D1",

I forgot to tell you all about my follow up visit with my gyn.  We were checking to see if I'd had any more vag bleeding (I hadn't--I'm convinced that was more about Tamox than a menstrual thing) and we were going to talk about the article LJ linked to me about anti-depressants and Tamox.  Well, he'd found all sorts of articles saying the same thing as LJ's, mostly fingering Paxil as the bad guy, not so much Wellbutrin, which is what I'm taking.  But I pointed out that Wellbutrin was mentioned enough for me to be concerned and if it was compromising the effectiveness of the Tamox, then I wanted off the Tamox so I could stop taking all these other pills to combat the Tamox se's.  My gyn believes, as does my onc, that Tamox does so much good, they're hesitant to take me off.  So we sent a fax to my onc, explaining all of this, to see what he thinks.  My gyn will call me when he hears back.  No news yet.  In the meantime, I'm taking both the Tamox and the Wellbutrin (which I am taking at 25% of a regular anti-depressant dose).  I can't go off the Wellbutrin because I'll become a raging bitch and I don't like that.  Apparently when I'm down, rather than going into a shell, I try to bring everyone around me down, too.  Nice. Other than that, I seem to be spending more and more time on fb.  No wonder my kids never seem to get to their chores! Oh, and I have a terrible sinking feeling that we missed some Jewel birthdays this week: CHJ on Tuesday and Jenn on Wednesday. CHJ--HAPPY BELATED BIRTHDAY!!!!! Jenn--HOPE YOUR BDAY WAS THE BEST!!!!!

      "Content": "Mar 3, 2008 09:48AM Determined1 wrote: KathyL--more beautiful than I could have imagined.  Thank you for sharing the pix.  The little ones made me \"awwww\" out loud. Okay, a little less foggy today.  Man, the chemo brain and fatigue thing is rough!!!!  Today is much better, although my hips, knees and shoulder blade joints feel \"rotten.\"  Kinda like when you cook the Thanksgiving turkey and you just twist off the bones feeling.  (Does that make sense?)  Keeping up on the max str tylenol to keep it manageable, and know it will pass.  I will say my patience to deal with se's this time is waning.  Ready to be done.  Soon, soon!!!! Yesty was tough and the dh was on the puter all day, so I couldn't check in.  I read thru everything (I think...) and it makes me happy to hear how we're all there for one another.  What a magnificent group we are! Please forgive my choppy approach today, but the old brain isn't quite with me (and I have to save some power for my doc appointments later!).  Anyway, wanted to pass on that I brought up the spasms again to my onc on Wed. before my tx and lo and behold, he actually acknowledged them!  Even the dh mentioned the onc's change of heart!  The onc wouldn't use the word spasm himself, (he only would call it severe bone pain), but he said mine come rather late in the game at Day 6.  So I got out my handy Jewel study and told him that I'd done a little homework on the spasms with my friends and that of the 6 of us who'd weighed in at that point, 4 reported spasms at Day 6 or later, and only 2 at Day 4 (when the doc says you SHOULD have them).  He was actually receptive to the info.  Not sure what's he's going to do with it, but if it helps someone down the road have her pain understood, then it's worth it.  Thanks Jewels, for participating! Sista2 (and other rad queens)--I read the info sheet from the first rad onc I see on Wed.  Looks like getting started is a time commitment.  I have a consultation that should last between 1-2 hours on Wed (should be interesting, since that's spasm day!  I'm taking the mil along to drive and help me listen because I'll probably be consumed with just trying to be comfortable.).  Then, if I choose to do rads with this guy, the simulation takes 2 hours (they set up angles and run you through it so you know what to expect).  Rad tx's themselves are supposed to run 15 mins.  I found it interesting that in the info they said sometimes the equipment shuts down for security purposes and that my tx may be canceled on a day, but not to worry.  Makes me wonder....  This is at Georgetown University Hospital, which is old, but a leader in cancer care.  My second consultation is at my local hospital and I'll have lots of questions when I go there, since it's nearby, newer, but not as critically acclaimed.  A friend of mine was saying she likes Georgetown because the level of care is better (more current, maybe?), but Arlington Hospital is newer/cleaner looking.  I'll eventually go with my gut, I know.  (Whoo, that was a babble, wasn't it?)  Anyway, I'll fill you all in on the burps and farts of the experience and I'll try to have more cogent thoughts! KathyL--you're the best type A ever!!!  Thanks for keeping up on tx's for us.  And I laughed so much when you retold your reaction story to a friend that was there!  I had the exact same experience with my friend after tx3 when she came to pick me up and I didn't remember a darn thing!  Good thing neither of us were driving on those days!  Hope you get to go to the service on Wed. Hooray and congrats to Julie's ds!!!!  2nd place is awesome!! WVgirl--go dh!  go dh!  go dh!!  (You sound good--I'm happy for you.) Vettegal--Lashes, particularly on the bottom, are almost gone.  I think I may have like 10 on each eye.  I have a few more on the top, but they are quite sparse.  I use that lash primer stuff before mascara and it really seems to plump up what I do have.  Brows have developed some blank patches, but I had really thick brows from the start, so I'm just letting them be.  I tried drawing some in, but it looked worse.  Besides, my coloring is so off, that a heavy brow doesn't look so good, anyway.  I do not have wrinkly fingers--you're spending too much time in the sitz bath for the sharts, I think!!!! Carol--the pic was great!  You make me wish I had a recliner!  I tend to sprawl on the sofa, but my dh waits on me, too.  Gotta love it.  And I'm so glad your hoot was up to par!  Golfing surely gave it a workout, so your confidence level over it must be pretty high about now.  Yay!  Oh, and thanks for digging up the posting instructions for KathyL--you're a star! Good luck today to Sheshe, my Vernors sister!  Hope you have some in the pantry for when those taste buds go MIA! Almost 10a to me and gotta shower and get to my 11a appointment.  So TTFN! Keep sparklin'!!!!! D1",

Yeah, Vettegal, you and PALady HAD to hear me honking!  I was ALL OVER my horn as I passed the state line!  Sorry to hear about another reaction during tx.  It sounds like they were ready this time.  Maybe they need to drip it slower???  That's what they did to me for tx3&4.  They kept speeding it up a little at a time, but never so fast that I reacted again.  Shoot, by the time they figure out the right combination you'll be done!!!!!  I wish mild se's for you, my friend.  (The chicken joke made me lol--wish I weren't so simple...) Carol--will the finals be done in time for the big par-tay?  Must've been a good early gift to see the ds's Spanish grade go from F to C.  (Altho, wouldn't an F mean \"fantastico?\").  My oldest struggled with grades in high school (doesn't help that she's dyslexic and has other learning issues, for which she would not accept an IEP.  She said they don't give you IEPs in life, so she didn't want one in hs.  She survived and got into a very good college, so it's all okay).  Anyway, back to my point.  We used curfew as the carrot to keep her motivated.  If she was on the honor roll (all As and Bs), then she got to stay out later.  It wasn't till the end of her junior year that she earned the 11pm curfew (I didn't care--the early curfews meant I knew she was home), and all her friends were able to stay out till like 1 or something stupid.  But since she was in charge of earning her own curfew, it was never our fault that she had to be home early.  Course, her senior year she finally got academic religion and earned a 12p, then 1a curfew with not much trouble.  But she was older and had gained our trust by the time she was able to stay out that late.  Better for me than the car thing because if we took keys away, that meant I had to ferry her around and listen to her bitch about how mean we were.  Anyway, happy early b-day wishes to you!!!  May you taste your cake... LWDana--I think you're losing your mind......   :)    (Hope you're doing okay today.) OMG, WVgirl, you had me LOL with the pens in the dishwasher story!  And I'm sorry you're missing a baby shower to go get what I fondly call the f*cking shot.  That's just not fair. KathyL, you can get sappy with us anytime.  I have many, many moments when I'm thinking the same thing about our little group here.  In fact, my dh and dd just yesty told me I need to wear something other than my FUBC t-shirt, because I wear one all the time (I wisely ordered a 2nd one, so one is always clean and at the ready).  But I want to wear my shirt because it makes me feel closer to everyone here.  Besides, maybe I'll bump in to one of you in the world and you'll recognize me by the shirt!  I think you were just articulating what we all feel from time to time.  Oh, and like WVgirl, I still do baskets for my kids--and they always have a new spring shirt and a pair of socks in them (not sure why the socks, but somehow it became our tradition).  In fact, college girl was fretting about how would the Easter Bunny find her at school????  (I'm a mom, I can handle that one!) Thanks for the sweet dreams wishes, Jenn.  It was better last night.  I'm so glad you're getting the le attention.  Sounds like you've worked yourself a pretty sweet deal! Hi Julie!!!  I know you're lurking!!! Hey Peg, I honked at you, too, yesty, when I drove through Frederick and passed the Hagerstown exit.  Hope you heard me! CHJ--you have me craving Chinese!!!  Hope the pooper continues to cooperate.  You've been such a trooper. TinaLee--not to worry about your eligibility for the Olympics.  All you need to do is deny steroid use during a teary press conference--works for everyone else!!!  Glad the taxol is okay for you. Oh man, SIS Kimberly, I am SO in to your April Fools wish!  And I loved your suggestions to Carol on the grades.  My college girl did not bring any work home with her over the break.  She worked her brain to mush last week so she could be study free.  I'm hoping to see a movie and get our nails done (if mine stop being so painful).  Other than that, I'm sure she's going to be chillin' with friends.  She's up right now, getting ready to go with some pals to the G'town v. Louisville bball game.  What a life.  Hey, enjoy your pre-tx weekend! Hey Deb.  You okay? Well, I'm going to toddle off and get dressed to exercise.  I need to get back into that habit and there's no time like now! Have a good Saturday, Jewels. D1",

Yep, another empirical study, and there already seems to be a link between le and coldness/numbness of the hand!  We need to be more aggressive about educating our docs!  Keep up with your therapy, we'll warm those extremities up eventually!  (Maybe by July?) I've started something new with my legu.  I'm doing kinesio taping.  It's this weird tape that has stretchiness to it that is supposed to slightly \"lift\" my skin so it stimulates the lymph cells underneath.  The tape is arranged on my skin like a river.  The mouth of the river is where we want the lymph to go (near new/alternative lymph nodes) and the fingers of tape coming out of the river's mouth represent the rivers themselves.  They end at the point where my fluid builds up.  The thinking is that the tape will stimulate the lymph glands just under my skin to move my fluid from the buildup point along the \"rivers\" to the \"mouth\" to be dumped into functioning lymph nodes.  I got the tape on Thursday and my legu already noticed that some of my swelling had gone down (she's not completely crazy--I noted it was easier to put my arm down, so it must be true).  This, combined with compression (I'm not liking that much) seems to be getting the swelling on my torso under control.  We have my arm at an okay point, so now we need to get my shoulder blade, and the worst of it, my pit area under control.  She's having a compression garment fitter come in one day this week to talk to me about those (sounds medieval to me).  I'm also continuing with massage and the taping.  You can find out more about the taping at http://www.lymphnotes.com/article.php/id/215/. Always sumthin'. How did I find my lump?  I had a mammo in Dec. 06 and received the \"all clean\" letter in the mail about the 2nd week of Jan. 07.  Days later I notice a lump when doing a self breast exam.  (Okay, maybe I overstate.  About every 4-5 months I would try to remember to feel myself up when watching tv--I'd always heard it was important to be in the same position!  Just happened to be conducting my not-so-routine routine and noticed something new.)  Since I'd just gotten the all clear from the professionals, I waited till my next scheduled gyn exam in May to ask someone about it.  He didn't like it and sent me to my first surgeon.  Surgeon didn't like it, either, so did a needle biopsy.  That came back benign.  Surgeon still didn't like it, so suggested we remove it.  Since it was \"benign,\" we didn't worry and I celebrated my kid's high school graduation, went on family vaca, etc.  Finally did the surgery in mid-August.  Oh-oh, here starts the serious part of the journey... Jenn, I know the waiting is hard.  But please know fingers are crossed for you.  Let us know. D1",

Vettegal--I'm working up my very best vibes for your sis tomorrow.  I hope everything comes back okay.  I was glad to read your sharts are down, but what's up with A. Flo?  Shouldn't you be in chemopause by now?  (There HAVE to be some benefits.) Paula--hope the dh is doing better.  I'm sorry you're going to miss the ds's game, particularly since its so nice outside.  That stinks. Oh yeah, it's most def DANA TIME!  Try A+D ointment on a Q-tip for your nose.  Or I think KathyL uses Vaseline.  They keep things moist. KathyL--you are running around like a crazy woman!!  Enjoy that nice weather and the later sunsets. It's so nice to hear you're feeling good, CHJ.  You've had such a rough go of it at first--it's your time. LJ--four weeks till your next onc appt?  I'd take that as a good sign, too.  Hope everything went well today. Oh Tina, you pose such good questions.  One I think we all ask ourselves (and good rant in reply, SIS Kimberly).  There was cancer in my family, but no breast cancer.  And, like you, I eat well, I don't smoke (yes, there was that college period when I did inhale my pot, but, hey, it was the 70's!), and I exercise regularly.  I shouldn't have this.  But I have to agree about our food sources.  I also think the birth control pills (feeding frenzy for my hormone-happy tumor) I took to stabilize my menopause symtoms played a role.  And my dh thinks we live on top of 3 mile island since the neighbor two doors down is a bc survivor.  Who knows?  Shit just happens.  I'm hoping this will make me a better person... Oh, so my radonc called today.  He apologized, but said he was trying to coordinate my tests so that I can do some at the hospital near me.  I forgave him.  So, I have to get a MRI (my stupid ex-surgeon wouldn't approve a MRI, he said a mammo was good enuf--WE ALL know better) and a CT Scan with contrast (needles-ugh).  I think they'll be done next week, so I'll be at med appts almost non-stop (if you add in the le therapy).  Oh well, it's Spring Break for my dd, so she and dh are going off together to visit some colleges and I'll be here alone.  Well, not alone.  My mom is coming in to keep me company.  So she can tag along to my appts.  Bad news is that she fell yesty and broke her arm.  I'm hoping she's okay...  Always sumthin'. Doggone, dd is hungry (why is it kids are getting hungry?).  Since it's almost 7p, I guess I should fix something for dins. Tomorrow's crazy for me, hope I can check in! Best to Paula and Deb who are both up for their first Taxols (at least I think that's right).  Let's hope its as easy for you two as it has been for LJ13.  Cheers! D1",

Deb, I'm so happy to hear your hands and feet are a little better today.  That's great news!!!  And you made it to work!  Hooray!  (I know that's important to you.)  You know, I did TC and have had horrible problems with my eyes.  Tearing like you describe (complete with the gross-out crusting), but my vision has also changed.  It seemed to change with each tx (the LensCrafters folks were getting tired of making me new glasses every 3 weeks, but I got lucky and ordered new specs right before my first tx and with their 30-day guarantee, I kept getting new ones for free!).  Now I'm no longer sure I can use my contacts, since the rx is several iterations ago (plus, with the tearing, I'd wash the darn things out, anyway).  You know, it's always sumthin'. Think I should go out and smell some flowers at Vettegal's suggestion--it's a nice day here (a little chilly, but there's sun, by golly!). D1",

      "Content": "Jan 28, 2009 08:43AM - edited Jan 28, 2009 08:44AM by Determined1 Whew!!!  I got my senior night program (all 28 pages worth) to the printer at 7p last night.  Spent the entire day chasing down a missing photo here and there and missing copy.  School got out at 12:30 cuz of the weather (I think we'd had, oh, and inch and a half of snow-what pussies in Northern VA!), so tracking these kids down was a feat.  I sure learned a lot about who likes my dd!  I'd identify myself as dd's mom and some of the kids would go, oh yeah, I LOVE her, and others would just grunt into the phone.  Kids are so funny.  I felt just awful for one girl.  From her bio I gathered that she lives with her aunt who was verbally abusing the girl-loudly-during our entire conversation.  The girl would shout profanities back at the aunt without even covering the mouthpiece of the phone.  How on Earth do we let children get in to situations like this?  I'm sure this girl is VERY anxious to get off to college...  Just a reminder how lucky I am. Anyhoo, I have to go back to the print shop this afternoon to approve the proof-I'm hoping they clear our roads a bit by then.  It iced all night long and you can't move around on it.  Dh went to get the paper this morning and stepped onto the driveway and proceeded to slide all the way down to the street.  I don't know how he managed to stay on his feet.  I, of course, doubled over in laughter, unfeeling wench that I am... Upshot-no school here today, either.  So thought I'd pop by and do my shouts and maybe get to calling some resorts (sounds like I should start with Mandalay Bay-or maybe I'll start with another one, just to work my patter out) while I'm homebound.  Yoga's cancelled-boooooo-but my MLD massage at 3p is still on, so all is not lost.  I'm also going to try to convince dd to help me make a vegetarian lasagna for dinner, just to teach her how to make one.  (Oh yeah, I'm high fiving myself because I went to the grocery yesty before it got ugly out there and bought all kinds of fruits and veggies to have fun with today.  Much better than eating junk when you're cooped up in the house!) While I'm talking about eating, I need to report that I seem to have shaken one of the four remaining pounds I want to lose.  You'll all recall that I'm trying to get back to my pre-dx weight and there seems to be four pounds that are stuck.  Unfortunately, the menopause thing has rearranged my body a bit, so no matter how much weight I lose, my waist is a bit thicker than it was pre-dx, so none of my old pants or skirts fit.  I really hate shopping so this is a big problem for me.  My college girl (who LOVES/lives to shop) says it's about time I shake all of my clothes from the 80's.  I'll get to it, eventually.  Luckily, my summer play garb is in good shape as I had to accumulate some stuff for cation last summer, so LV, here I come!!!  Maybe I'll even lose that last three pounds before July 12! Speaking of July, KathyL, you and I both have anniversaries around the Jewel Junkett.  Yours is the 8th (right?) and mine is the 17th.  We'll just sandwich the Junkett in there.  It would be great to have him along!  Oh, I'm reading your post.  Your day is the 8th.  I'm going on 27 years, how bout you?  WoooHooo to ds for almost completing his potty chart!  I imagine the bike is a great incentive.  Oh, and I really like what you and dh are doing with your couples' study-it makes you feel good to give something back, doesn't it?  You guys getting this ice? Oh no, Paula!  Surely you're familiar with tp-ing!  You're right, it's toilet papering.  I did it/had it done to me a few times in high school.  It was as naughty as I got.  I'm sure Kris was howling with laughter with those kids! You remind me-I'm good with looking in to room rates for us, but not so keen on figuring out excursions to Hoover Dam (amazing if you've never been there.  Our favorite expression from our tour guide was when we were all making \"damn\" jokes amongst ourselves and he said, \"leave the damn jokes to the dam professionals.\"  Hmmm.  Guess you had to be there.  Seemed funnier then.).  Anyway, if someone wants to step up and figure out excursions, that would be great.  I'm thinking we'll need transportation, too. Speaking of transportation, I haven't given it a lot of thought, but I was thinking that I would shuttle/taxi to the hotel and not rent a car.  Everything I can think to do is on the strip and I can walk.  Maybe Patty, our LV expert, will have some insight on this topic... Ah ha, I see Julie's not only brushing up on her gambling skills, but she's also working on her alcohol tolerance!  I can tell I'm going to be woefully unprepared... Deb, you remind me to address the vision thing.  You guys may not remember, but I had horrendous vision issues with chemo.  Every time I went in for an infusion, my eye rx changed.  I gave the LensCrafters 30 day guarantee a real workout as I got a new pair of glasses every month the entire time I was doing chemo.  After about 6 months following my last tx, my eyes had changed enough that I needed new glasses again, and now, another 6 months later, I've just ordered another new pair.  I haven't been able to get back in to my contacts as my reading vision is still pretty messed up.  I can read a book with my contacts and reading glasses, but I cannot use the computer.  I'm thinking my contact days may be behind me.  It's hell to get old...  But just sayin' that the chemo can wreak havoc on your eyes. SISKimberly, thanks for mentioning the water drinking to Carol.  About a month ago I decided to try to drink 2 liters of water a day.  I get out a .5 liter bottle and fill and drain it 4x.  I think that might be how I lost that sticky pound this month (hopefully the other 3 will follow suit), AND it keeps the toxins moving in my body.  One thing I'm discovering is that after I do MLD (whether with a person or in my machine) I now have to use the bathroom immediately afterward as the MLD, combined with the extra fluid in my body, moves the lymph through my system more efficiently.  So, drink your water! Maybe FaceBook isn't the place for us to plan.  I hesitate a little in putting it all here, in a public place.  Maybe when we get our details nailed down, we should use email or something.  As you know, I haven't disclosed my identity on this thread, although I don't hesitate to do so with you guys in more secure areas.  Personally, I'd like to keep a modicum of privacy.  Does anyone have an idea on how we can communicate effectively, but maintain some privacy? Good use of the BGP, Carol.  I have found that I'm worse than before when it comes to needles, too.  Not sure what that's all about.  Before your infusion, hydrate like a crazy woman.  It will plump up your veins.  And then ask them to put a heating pad on your arm before they look for a vein.  Fifteen minutes should do the trick.  If nothing else, I always appreciate the loving up that routine represents and it keeps me from ripping the elastic waist off the BGPs! Thanks, Therese, for the review on the Bellagio pool.  I've only read reviews and looked at their website (which of course makes it sound great).  I'll keep Bellagio in the mix for now.  Besides, I think Deb is salivating down there in Arkansas over their buffet! Sherry, remember to take off your headset periodically and give your ears a break. So why am I not surprised that Julie is learning all about photoshop???  I could have used you while I was working on my program when I discovered this kid or that missed the group photos.  Rather than photoshopping the kids in, I just used multiple pictures.  So the kids that go to practice everyday are in all of the pictures.  I think they deserve that, anyway. Deb, how can you be an iPhone person and not a fb person???  Hey, good luck on Friday. Oh my, blushing, an A++++!  I was always such a suck up. How disappointing to learn that you have parents with as little interest in education as the kid, SISKim.  You have to continue to do the best you can to engage and hope that somehow, something will spark for that kid someday.  Hold your head up.  It may not happen while the kid's in your class, but the cumulative effect of caring, dedicated teachers will get to those kids eventually. Paula, your fb is incredible!  I haven't even been able to look through it all.  One of these days I'll have to put more stuff on mine.  I just haven't made it part of my routine, yet.  I seem to go in spurts.  I like what you all are saying about moving on from bc and staying connected as friends, though.  By the end of this, we'll have all the Jewels on fb-yes, even KathyL and Deb!!! Oh, you saw my comments about privacy.  While posting in the header is really a good idea, I hesitate... Carol, if you're going to run out and get us some new BGP, as Paula suggests, can we get something racy?  I never wear racy stuff and maybe if the BGP are a little on the steamy side it will give us one more thing to focus on, instead of the needles and whatnot... Therese, I smiled when I read the post about your dd making her way home after early dismissal.  They do grow up quickly, don't they? Lol, there's Julie, calling me a suck up.  You're just jealous. And Paula-a brown noser! Okay, FUCK CANCER.  Paula, it sounds like the hospice discussion is due.  You know that Ed will want you to do what's best for your whole family.  From the relationship you describe, I can't see how anyone would do any less.  I'm sorry you guys are at this point, and I continue to have hope.  We're here for you.  ((((((((hugs))))))). I've spent too much time on this already today.  I'm going to fill my coffee mug and read the paper. I'll let you know how my travel agent hat wears! D1",

Beth--you're moving a lot faster than I am.  I was dx in mid-August and am FINALLY getting to do something.  Of course, I did have 3 surgeries--each a month apart--which filled my dance card for fall, but since the end of October, I've just been seeing a couple of oncs to figure out whether or not I needed chemo (seems I was a gray area patient).  Everyone seems to agree now that I'm node positive--I had 2 micromets on one sentinel node, .4mm and .6mm.  Apparently, if your micromets are above .2mm you get chemo.  But no one was acknowledging the elephant in the room.  Not sure why.  Anyhoo, I'm past all that and moving on now.  What a relief. As for questions, keep a paper and pencil handy and jot stuff down as it occurs to you.  There are no stupid questions.  I found by reading these boards I came up with all sorts of questions (I particularly found learning about the risk of lymphedema important as my surgeon never told me about the care and feeding of my arm, but as soon as I asked him to confirm what I'd read here, he quickly agreed.  Interestingly, he never volunteered any additional info--what I know, I learned right here).  So read here and take your questions to your team.  Knowledge is power. And vettegal--I know you from another thread!  Happy to see you here (is happy appropriate?--never quite sure about these things!).  You must be in for your anxially dissection next.  Remember ice after the surgery.  I swear by it.  When are you having it done?

Even though my Oncotype score is an 11, and even though my Ki67 is at 5%, I'm going to take a deep breath (hopefully not so deep I pass out) and put one foot in front of the other and do it.  I'm going to be 50 in less than 2 months, so I have a lot of living to do.  My tumor was 1.8cm--over the comfort zone of less than 1 cm to avoid chemo and the kicker is, I have micromets on one lousy node.  That either means my surgeon was sloppy and re-used the scalpel, or my cancer wants to spread.  You know what?  I'm not taking a chance.  Even though chemo only gives me 3-4 percentage points of an advantage of no recurrence, I'll take 3-4%.  I just hope and pray that I don't screw my body up for something down the road by pumping it full of poison.  But, I'll have to deal with that then.  There have been many years of research showing chemo really does help.  I choose to believe it.  (Remind me of this in two weeks' time.) Once they have the path on your anx node dissection, you'll have more information to help you with your decision.  And don't let anyone hurry you into your decision.  Once all the reports say clean margins and nodes, you can take some comfort in the fact that your cancer has been surgically removed.  Chemo is your insurance policy.  Take your time to decide whether or not you want to buy it.  It took me something like 6 weeks to come to my decision.  Get other opinions, anything, to help you get the information you need.  Whatever you decide, I truly believe two things 1) you will make the right decision for you, and 2) you cannot make the wrong decision. Be peaceful, Vettegal (and it's okay to be scared--you're in excellent company). D1",

First of all, Vettegal--good to hear you're home.  I imagine you're having your Christmas eve dinner with your drains suitably dressed.  Take the pain meds for as long as you need them.  That's why you have them.  I did find I could get by during day after a while with just something over the counter.  That way I didn't miss so much of the family action in la la land. I cannot believe the number of us starting tx's on Dec. 27.  The Jewels will be sparklin' that day, won't we??? NYC was great, if not wet.  We walked miles and miles (even in a driving rain), but it felt great to be outside with millions of my closest friends.  We window shopped and did a walking tour (of my dh's making) of the lights in the city.  What a magical place.  I love the energy, but am glad I don't live there all the time--it would be exhausting!  And you'd have to have A LOT of money!  But it was great to get away and be with my family. Cool experience on the train home.  I sat next to, you'll never guess, Hoda Kotb!  We exchanged a little small talk for the first half hour, but then I couldn't stand it any longer and I said, \"I hope this isn't too personal or forward of me, but thank you for sharing your bc experience--it came at a time I was being diagnosed myself and really helped.\"  After that we were fast friends.  My husband was amazed as I can be talkative, but am usually tongue-tied around famous people.  She shared her journey with me and listened as I shared mine with her.  She seemed genuinely interested in how my family was coping and all in all, was a very nice person.  It's funny, about the time I was being dx'd she did her series of reports on the Today show and now, here I am on the brink of chemo and she pops into my life again.  I'm not sure what it means, but it must be a sign of some sort.  Just wish I knew what it meant...  Maybe just to remind me that things will be back to normal (whatever that is) before I know it.  It was exciting for me. I'll try to catch up with everyone and read the posts more carefully (have the drains come out, Carol?) later.  We're getting ready to have our traditional Christmas Eve dinner of rice with milk/sugar/cinnamon and lefse (my dh is Scandinavian).  Dinner on Christmas day is ALWAYS much better! :) Merry Christmas, everyone!!!

And welcome, Jenny--we always have room for more.  I'm amazed at how many of us have made new year's resolutions to start chemo!  Who'da thunk it? Carol, glad the drain removal went okay.  I do think our vision is a bit skewed, but I do agree with you that a cut hand is generally not life-(or holiday) threatening.  What a hard-hearted group we have become! I did see a show in NYC.  We got tix to \"The Little Mermaid.\"  It would'nt have been my first choice, but my college girl LOVES that movie and was totally enchanted the entire time.  The show hasn't officially opened, yet, and you could see where they needed to work out some kinks, but the woman who sang the lead was incredible.  Having watched that movie about a million times myself when my girls were young, I was moved to tears several times.  The experience transported me to a time when my girls would sit in the back seat, strapped into their car seats, and we'd bellow the songs to that movie on the tops of our (tuneless) lungs.  Life has been very good. Anyway, not sure if I'll get a grip on reality tomorrow, or not.  So I'm going to bed a little early so I can cope with my personal insanity as I prepare for chemo. Onward through the fog. D1",

It wasn't so bad.  Here's the story: Got to the hospital at 8:15a for my bloodwork (which they kindly ordered by fingerstick).  I have a \"standing order\" for this bloodwork, so I asked the guy what that meant--did I have to bring the paperwork every time, or would it be in the computer?  He told me a standing order meant that he has to take my blood while I'm standing.  I cracked up (simple, I know, but hey, I was about to get my body pumped full of poison, so any laugh was good).  The dh wanted to know what was going on in there, he never hears me laugh when I'm getting bloodwork. So on to the chemo lounge.  Checked in and waited forever while they mixed my cocktail (if I went to a bar that took that long, I'd never go back!).  My case nurse came in while I was waiting and brought me a calendar of my chemo events and helped me schedule my appts.  I was surprised to learn that I have to get my bloodwork done every week (again, they are accommodating me by doing it via fingerstick).  Now in to the CHAIR.  (Oh, took a leak first, I drank a gallon of water before 8am this morning and skipped my coffee for two days in a row, just in case it would negate the effect of the water.)  I settled in and proceeded to tell my nurse about my needle phobia, which my dh loudly supported.  My nurse is an angel.  She got some heated towels to put on my arm for about 20 minutes which did the trick.  That girl got the IV in right away.  Of course I was totally clenched and still see spots before my eyes from that, and have a sore jaw, but the butt muscles were all the better for the 10 minutes in the clenched position!  She gave me about 10 minutes to come down from my tightass before starting the drip. First came the Decadron--took 15 minutes.  Then the Anzumet, another 15 minutes.  Then a wait for the big guns.  While waiting for the pharmacy to mix it up the nurse told me to take colace for the next 5 days to keep my stools soft.  Apparently the Anzumet can make you all constipaty (family word, sorry).  Now the Taxotere.  This can cause allergic reactions for some, but they happen while you're in the chair, so the nurse stuck around for the first 15 minutes of that drip (took an hour all told) to watch me.  We chatted about se's and how to handle them, so it was good.  I had no problems.  Then the Cytoxan.  She put the drip for 30 minutes, but explained that some folks get nasty sinus headaches when it goes in that fast, so if I developed one, I was to let her know to slow it down.  No prob.  I did feel my arm get colder with that one and it seemed to get heavy, but I suspect that was the cumulative effect of pumping so much liquid into my arm.  Then she came to take out the IV and before I could work myself into a panic, she was done.  I left at 2:45. Clothes.  I wore jeans, a t-shirt, a sweatshirt, heavy socks and sneakers.  I thought I'd have to take the sweatshirt off for the IV, but the cuffs are loose enough that we were able to pull up the sleeve and it was fine.  The only thing that got cold was my exposed IV arm and I wrapped it in a towel. What to take.  My iPod was my savior (Pink Floyd, Sheryl Crow, Brand New, Fleetwood Mac, Counting Crows--I know, eclectic).  Also read the paper and a magazine.  Didn't talk much to the dh with the iPod on, but he was reading and playing with his Blackberry.  When we did talk, he was trying to remember if we said \"in sickness and in health\" when we were married by the justice of the peace 25 years ago...  He wasn't sure he was compelled to be there to be so BORED. :) I'm a little wired (steroids), famished (steroids), and cotton heady (lack of coffee).  But okay otherwise.  Just waiting for the se's to kick in. Tomorrow after 2:15 I get my neulasta shot (my friend, Karen, from a Just Diagnosed thread calls it nasty-lasta because of the se's).  I understand its bone and joint pain.  (Guess it's hard for the body to keep up with all that white blood cell making.)  Something to anticipate! It wasn't so bad.  (Talk to me when I have my se's!) So, Vettegal, good news about the drains!  And path report tomorrow.  Gosh, I have my fingers crossed that it's good.  You must let us know. And SIS Kimberly, keep stretching those arms!  I actually lifted a plate with food on it with my outstretched arm last weekend and didn't wince and it made me happy! Welcome to our group, deeat58.  Sad talk is okay, you're supposed to vent here.  Hope you're doing okay.  Like me, you're probably watching your body like a hawk waiting for any se's to pop up.  I hope it goes okay for you. And LJ13, yuyubear, DianeB, let us know how you did today.  And WVgirl, you got your port today and start chemo tomorrow--what an ending to the year!  Hope you're doing well. Wow, Jewels, long post (and I wrote this once already and lost it #$%^ computer!).  Anyway, Onward through the fog! D1",

I'm hoping we'll be okay for desk work.  I run the basketball boosters for my high school and I'm coordinating a cadre of parents this year to do the physical stuff while I keep track of everything from my computer.  In past years I did everything--finances, grocery shopping, setting up/running/clean up of snack bar, collecting dues, running other fundraisers, etc.  This year, I've been spending the first 6 weeks of the season showing other parents how to do the physical stuff, so I can just do things like coordinate volunteers.  I'll tell you, if these parents don't come through, I'm going to pull the wig-offing stunt as seen on Desperate Housewives! :) Hey Paxton/Jan, thanks so much for your perspective.  I cannot wait for the day I can help others with the wisdom of having this all behind me.

Okay Vettegal, crunch time!  Got those presents wrapped?!  I'm starting to freak out about the holiday and I don't do any cancer stuff till the 27th!  You must be in stress city.  Remember to take an Ativan before bed tomorrow to get a good night's sleep.  Sounds like you need it.  Heck, take one tonight, too! Carol--welcome to JJs!  (January Jewels--our moniker--I've decided we should all get diamonds post-treatment.  If you have anyone who can buy them for us that would be a great contribution!)  How are you doing?  Any movement on the arm?  Remember to ice it. KathyL--any news from the cancer talk?  I'm all about stealing ideas from other people as sometimes I don't really know what to ask.  Many times I find your experiences help me so much with mine.  Hope your MUGA was okay. Sharon--hope you're doing okay.  Please post with an update when you're up to it. We're off to NYC this weekend to window shop and see \"The Little Mermaid\" on broadway.  My oldest (18) LOVED The Little Mermaid when she was little--I even still \"see\" the songs in my sleep.  Probably not most folks' first choice for a broadway show, but I know we'll have a good time.  Next day, we're going to walk around the NYU campus (even though no one will be there) since that's a school on my little one's (16--junior in high school) list.  Back home on the train on Christmas Eve.  So I have to have everything ready by Friday evening.  I figured what the heck--what's a little more stress around the holiday?? Hope everyone is good.  I'm going to enjoy a bottle of wine with my dh tonight--my chemo nurse told me I'm not supposed to drink while I get tx's.  I'm hoping I can prove her wrong as I LOVE a glass (or two) of wine every night if I can.  But just in case, I'm going to sauce it up over the next week!  ;) Onward through the fog!

Kimberly--Hoda Kotb is one of the anchors on the Today show.  She usually comes on after 9am, I think, but sometimes she subs as newsreader for Ann. So, several of us get started tomorrow.  WVgirl has her port surgery and DianeB, yuyubear, LJ13 and I start chemo.  Whew!  The post holiday rush, I guess.  I got up this morning and took the first two decadron--it appears this is actually going to happen!  Need to take the next two before 3p.  I've almost finished the laundry and am working on cleaning the house.  I think I might be psychotic!  I've sent everyone off to do present returns/exchanges to get them out of my hair (hmm--weird choice of words...).  I'm nervously excited about tomorrow.  Actually, I can't wait till the first one is over--the unknown is a killer!  I'm VERY nervous about the IV, but I'm so afraid of needles, it's not funny.  Once I get past that, I'm thinking it will be okay.  I hope I can sleep tonight... Anyone heard from Sharon?  I think she had her first tx something like 2 weeks ago.  I hope everything is okay for her. Sorry about the drains, Vettegal.  I never had any, but as a result, I developed a couple of NASTY seromas.  One leaked out of my boob incision and kept me homebound for several days as I basically stood over the sink with fluid dripping out.  Not fun.  So try to view the drains with some compassion--they are helping you out.  Oh, and the numbness--oh yeah.  I was numb down the back/inside of my arm to my elbow and around my back to my shoulderblade, plus the numbness from my boob toward my arm.  It's getting better.  I still have twinges on my back around my shoulderblade, but from my pit to elbow seems okay.  Armpit still numb (shaving is strange) and top of boob is still numb.  I'm hoping it all comes back--time will tell. I'll be back to let you all know how it's going.  But overall I'm ready to get this party started. Onward! D1",

Last supper (hmmm, doesn't sound quite right, but I think you'll all understand) was barbeque ribs from the Rendezvous Restaurant in Memphis.  We live just outside of DC, so we had them flown in.  It was part of my Christmas present.  Unbelievably good.  We also had some of my dh's homemade baked beans (to die for), but I'm worried as they give me gas and I'm not sure that was a good decision on my part...  Hopefully I won't be too gross tomorrow!

(is that possible?) I haven't had as much.  One night in there I had some bourbon that was like from heaven, but haven't done much else.  I'm thinking my desire will kick in tomorrow (feeling almost like myself, but tired today) and I plan to partay!  Hormone changes?  Hmm.  Got my period on Jan. 1--as if back spasms weren't enough for the new year!  Hoping to see the end of that \"visitor.\"  My long and tawdry cancer tale includes 3 blood tests to see if I was post-menopausal (if I had been, I didn't need chemo--not sure I ever understood why, but anyway).  Every single one of those blood tests came back and said I was past menopause, but I keep having periods.  Goes to show you they don't know everything! Sherry/Donna--you were both wiped out?  Did they give you Ativan?  I've talked to others who got ativan either in pill form beforehand, or as part of their cocktail, and they were zoned out from tx day.  I didn't get any of that, just the steroids to combat nausea and I was so wired I couldn't sit.  Another reminder that we are all individuals, I guess.  Hope you both continue to feel okay.  (Fingers are crossed that the nasty-lasta goes easy on you!) Carol--has your pt suggested an arm sleeve for you when you fly?  I'm so paranoid about lymphodema, myself, and don't know how far we have to go to protect ourselves for the rest of our lives.  There's another woman on this board who got a sleeve for air travel and even Hoda Kotb mentioned that she used one when she flew (which is, I'm sure, all the time).  Could I impose on you to perform a community service for us and check on that the next time you have pt?  (Unless, of course, chemo brain has kicked in by that time and we all forget!) LJ13--Excellent work on the MUGA description!  I was really wrapped about heart issues as my dad suffered from heart-related ailments till his death.  In fact, part of the reason I'm doing TC, rather than AC, was to avoid the long term potential heart damage (I went for the one that carries long term potential lung damage!).  I do agree with your advice on the exercise, however, I think we should all engage in some sort of activity as best we can while we go through this.  I'm convinced it will help our bodies and I know, from personal experience, that it will help our minds. And we're up to 29 facets!!!!  Thanks for the head count, Vettegal! Off to watch my kid in her basketball game--hope she doesn't get splinters from riding the pine tonight!  (I'll have to share how she's not coping with bc another time.  Poor kid.) Signing off as a spasm-free D1!!!",

For those mourning the loss of coffee/alcohol--cry no longer.  I'm here to tell you I didn't want much of either for the week after tx (although I only went 3 days with no coffee--I really can't live without it), but now I'm consuming both at normal levels.  ;)  In fact, the only thing wrong with me now (other than the usual complaints from my family) is I am covered with blisters (the ones in my mouth are not as bothersome as they were last week), I'm tiring more easily, I get dizzy going down stairs, I'm as dry as a desert--mouth, eyes, nose, skin, and my scalp is numb.  You guys, this is all manageable.  Yeah, I went through some bad days that first week after, but for all of us with the every 3 weeks regimen, we'll have two good weeks between tx's.  Fingers are crossed that something unexpected doesn't crop up, but we can really do this. So Jewels, start with confidence.  Keep a smile on your face.  You're beating cancer!!!  FUBC!!! T-shirts.  I love the idea.  I've been playing with ideas in my head, too.  I even thought about \"January Jewels\" on the back and then list our screen names in two columns under it (or is that too much?), then FUBC over the breast pocket area.  I even toyed with the idea of putting FUBC in an arc on the top of the breast pocket, FUSE in an arc on the bottom and then \"breastcancer.org\" straight across in the middle of our FU messages.  But then I wondered if the bc.org folks would be upset with us if we included FU messages encircling their address.  Gosh, I hope I did justice to these descriptions.  I keep meaning to try to do a rough layout in Word and then cut and paste it here.  Maybe one day this week...  I did think about heading to a local shirt shop here to get some pricing, but I know my market will be expensive, so if someone in a more economical part of the world wants to check on that, it would be grand.  I'm sorry, I don't remember who talked about colors, but I'm not keen on all pink, either.  Hope everyone is doing okay.  I know neulasta aches are probably being felt today.  Hope everyone is popping max strength tylenol to keep those manageable. SIS Kimberly--your dinner sounds like it was so nice.  I'm very impressed with the chef!  Try not to stress out too much this week. Okay, my college girl is back to reclaim the computer, so I'll chat again tomorrow. D1",

SIS Kimberly--Not sure if you're on the same plan with the decadron--I take 2 the day before, day of and day after.  My onc told me not to take the second one anytime after 3p so the jitters that the steroids cause wouldn't interfere with my sleep.  Just thought I'd pass that along.  Oh, and drink lots and lots of water! Vettegal--you sound like me on the port.  I am SO AFRAID of needles, but was sick and tired of surgery, so when given the option to do my tx via IV, I went for it.  I think if you're getting more than 4 tx's they may steer you to a port, but you should ask about doing it with an IV, if that's what you want.  I hope work didn't kick your butt too much today.  Put your bad arm on a pillow when you get home and fire up the heating pad for those scars and have the dh bring you a glass of wine.  You need to relax. LJ13--seems to me there are some positives to being negative (hmmm, did that make sense?).  I've read that once you get through tx and the first 5 years, that you're actually in better long term shape than those of us who are er+/pr+. KathyL--Rhinestones for those new girls?  Oh yeah!  You almost make me jealous that I only have a boob and a half (that sweet little Frankenboob!).  You should make those babies shine!  And what a total dweeb I am!  I was all over my toolbar at the top of my screen trying to figure out how to boldface and it was right here the whole time.  Thanks for the assist. I have my biannual gyn exam in the morning.  Not sure how I feel about it.  A little weirded out at the prospect of taking Frankenboob out for a show.  I know this guy is my doc--and has been for almost 30 years--but he hasn't seen me since he sent me to a surgeon last May.  (He did call several times after I was first dx to make sure I was okay.)  It'll definitely be \"deep breath\" time.  Not sure why I felt like sharing that, but it's been on my mind all day. For the record--what is sex???  I've been married 25 years and I can't remember the last time I actually realized I was being intimate during a storm! You guys are great! D1",

SIS Kimberly--OMG I LOVE that poem!  Honestly, girl, I think you may have a new calling.  I hope today is going okay for you and that the Black Cat is working it's magic. I had my visit today with my gyn.  All my hesitations were for naught.  He chose to just chat with me this time, catching my file up with everything that's been going on.  I laid out my chemo decision for him and he told me that if I'd called him for an opinion he said he would have told me to do the chemo.  Made me feel good about my choice.  Despite the fact that I was feeling strange about flashing Frankenboob about, I asked him to feel a lump I'd noticed.  It was all very discreet--I didn't even disrobe, just hiked up my shirt and pulled my bra away just enough.  Anyway, back to the lump--I found it the day before my chemo started and figured it was scar tissue.  I asked my case nurse about it on chemo day and she told me to go ahead with chemo and have my gyn or surgeon look at it later.  (She did not see/feel it at that time.)  Since I had this gyn appointment, I decided I'd have my main man take a look.  (Besides, it takes a while to get in to see my surgeon--this was faster.)  My gyn was not happy about the lump and said I need to see the surgeon again.  How can this be?  My path reports were clear!  I just don't understand... Since my surgeon is in the same complex as my gyn, I walked over to the next building to make an appointment.  I told the receptionist what was going on and the first available is Jan. 17--the day after my next chemo.  So I took it.  I'm going to have my onc take a look at it when I see him on chemo day.  I'm also thinking that if my surgeon and onc don't like it, then I'm going to get an opinion from another surgeon.  As uneasy as it makes me to change horses, I think I need to find another surgeon.  And I'll probably have to get the damn thing cut off after all. Okay, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself here.  But I'm pissed/confused/etc. and my mind is just racing.  Maybe it's nothing... Sorry, ladies, I hate to be such a downer, but I gotta let this out.  (So unfair--everything was going so well!  Hear me whine???) I think the FUBC needs to be in VERY large lettering! D1",

Julie--You had me cracking up with the hooters story! :)  Good luck back at work.  Pack Purell and use it often.  I'm also fond of those Lysol wipey things to clean surfaces.  We do NOT want you sick! CarolC--Your story just makes me sick at heart.  KathyL had some great suggestions, I hope you can use them.  A few years back we hit some hard times and had to cash in some retirement money and pay the penalties--not a great option, I know, but we were able to get through with that.  Hopefully, you won't have to do anything to jeopardize your future earnings... Stay on top of the nausea drugs, Paula.  I understand it's really hard to play catchup.  You sound okay, though, hang in there. Can't wait to see balditude pix of Sherry, WVgirl and Vettegal! (As I recall, LJ13 didn't want to share--spoil sport!!!) Jenn--You and I seem to have similar problems.  You get the shakes and I get spasms.  What a pair.  I'm really trying hard to pay attention to my body this time and I realize that I constantly have my lower back muscles tightened.  Brushing my teeth?  Tightened.  Washing dishes?  Tightened.  Sitting watching tv?  Tightened.  Didn't realize I was such a tightly wound creature (my family has been saying this for years, but I never believed them).  I'm trying to use the heating pad today on my lower back and I'm really trying hard to relax the muscles.  Not sure if it'll chase away the spasms, but I'm trying it.  Maybe a heating pad will help you?  (I'm also thinking I need to revisit the whole med marijuana issue--I know I sound like such a pothead, but I haven't done anything like that in almost 30 years--I just remember that I was a happy high person!)  Also, heartburn, oh yeah, I know that se well.  Take a Pepcid AC about 4p--it really helps.  I'm hungry with heartburn and don't want to eat because it'll hurt, but I know I need food.  The Pepcid has been great.  Also, I'm living on dried toast, fried eggs, raisin bran cereal, bananas, granola bars, sweet potatoes, plain chicken breasts, and chocolate cake (never was a cake person, but I can't get enough!) for the few days following tx.  Try the Pepcid. I agree with LJ13--I think there is a bit of a cumulative effect going on.  Good news, I knew what to expect, so I'm better prepared, but I do feel it.  Both yesterday and today I can't seem to move well at all--just getting downstairs is a major accomplishment and takes hours of sitting to recover.  I move like a 110 year old person and have to hold on to stuff for balance (also feels like legs might give out at any second when I walk).  Everything is sore.  It even hurts to touch my cheeks.  Now the good news is, I know this will pass and I'm just biding my time till it's better again.  At least my hair won't fall out this time!  I'm popping max strength tylenol every 6 hours and waiting for 9p when I take the tylenol pm and knock myself out till 3 in the morning.  What a life!  Oh, and I want to add to Kathy's tx list that LJ13 has tx#3 (!) on Thursday, so we need to be sure to send her good thoughts that day, too.  (Way to stay on top of it, KathyL, not sure I could've done it this weekend.) Speaking of KathyL--how's it going with the little ones?  I don't know if I could do this with small kids around.  My dh was out of town yesty and my girls really stepped up with laundry and other household chores (I didn't know they could do them!).  They weren't so good with the food prep, but we managed.  Dh got home this afternoon and has turned around to take college girl back for her next semester.  I'm kinda sad she's gone--she's been great helping me through the first 2 tx's. Oh, and note to self--DO NOT have a needle biopsy right after a tx.  My poor Frankenboob is THROBBING from the trauma and the usual aches from se's.  Live and learn (I seem to do a lot of that.) Okay, back to football and my heating pad. D1",

CarolC--I am so thankful you're getting your situation under control.  I was talking to my mom about you and she suggested that some of these guys who are financing their own presidential campaigns should get their egos outta their asses and put their money toward establishing foundations to help folks through med crises!  Shoot, we'd probably instantly elect someone president who did that!!! How ya doin' Maz?  Good to see your post. Oh Vettegal, it must be awful to be one of the last to start!  You feel just like we all felt, please don't worry.  KathyL is a superstud with all her comments, read them carefully.  I will echo that days 3-4 are the worst.  (My infusion is on Wed., so Sat/Sun are bad for me.)  The day after you'll probably feel great (steroids).  I can do all my normal activities that day.  By the evening of the second day you'll start to wind down (I think its the steroids wearing off).  But you're not totally incompacitated.  I'm able to get around (VERY slowly) and COULD do things like get something to eat or do laundry, but if there's someone here, I just rest up and let them do it (I didn't do that very well the first tx and I think that's why I ended up with the spasms).  You've gotten lots of great advice from all of us regarding what you should have on hand to alleviate the se's, so of all of us, you'll probably be the best prepared!  And I do agree with KathyL, this really is a head game.  The tricky part for me has been when to overpower with the head and when to listen to my body.  I think I've done a much better job of it this time.  You'll figure out your balance--not to worry. Also agree with KathyL on the Taxotere drip.  My first time, the nurse set me up for a 1 1/2 hour drip and sat with me for the first 15-20 mins. to monitor.  We chatted about what se's to expect and how to combat them to pass the time.  I think since I sailed thru that one, they were more cavalier with me the second time (and I like Kathy's theory on why the reaction the 2nd time--makes sense to me).  (Oh, and now that it's behind me, I'm more than happy to take the bad reaction hit for the Jewels!!!)  Fortunately, my dh was right there and quickly reacted (as did the nurses).  It was dramatic, but I recovered quite quickly and we got on with the infusion, which dripped more slowly (speeding up as I was having no additional reaction).  Your nurses will watch you--they don't want you to be uncomfortable or have bad reactions.  These are some of the best nurses I've ever encountered and I know you'll feel the same. (Aside, of course, of our nursing Jewels here, who are THE BEST!) Get yourself ginger ale, ginger tea, etc. to combat the tasteless water thing (kicks in about day 3 for me and lasts about 5 days).  The Biotene morning and night and baking soda rinses are right on for the mouthsores, if you get those.  I added the baking soda rinses this time and have been much, much better on that score.  Have small, easy to get snacks (I like bananas and granola bars) for those times when you start to feel a little uggy in the tummy and it'll help chase it away.  Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!!!  Be sure to take all your prescribed meds!  My sister was here on Sat. and was telling me that she just barfed her way through chemo and I'm sitting there saying, didn't they give you drugs?  She said she couldn't seem to remember to take them, so she skipped them all the time.  And once you get behind--Katie bar the bathroom door!  Take your meds. You're just gonna shine like the jewel you are.  And when you feel like shit, come on by for a data dump--there's always someone to catch you!  (I think we're all learning that.)  You're beating cancer, girl!!  FUBC!!!!! SIS Kimberly--oh yeah, the hair.  I'll tell you, its actually liberating to get rid of it.  I notice that my stubbly bits are dark roots and found that the ones with gray at the root were the ones that fell out most quickly before the buzz.  You'll have to let us know who wins your caucus.  Oh, and the stubbly bits do still come out--when I rub my head with the towel after my shower there are all kinds of \"whiskers\" in the towel.  Not sure if we ever get the smooth pate, but a bit of stubble helps to act like velcro for the doo-rags! Good job on the first tx, CathyCA, have a great time in Utah!  Take your pharmacy!  ;) Okay, I need to get myself around for my physical therapy appt.  I'm really excited about it!  I'll report later/tomorrow.

CathyCA--French cooking?  That sounds like fun!  I hope you were able to taste the crepes.  And have a great time in Utah!  May those se's stay home! WVgirl--Good for you, I'm proud!  Taking control of your situation and getting those steroids cut back.  Way to sparkle!! Carol--Thanks again for staying on top of our shirt orders.  I know it's a big job.  And oh my, you had me lol when you asked if Vetteguy was going to wear his sandals to the tx to show off his pedi!    (or should I use the smiley with the foot???) AZDonna--Arf, arf!!  Glad the tooth is okay. Judy--Glad you don't have to drive that 500 miles too often.  Sounds like you worked everything out.  Can I ask you to give me more info for the header?  How often do you get your tx's?  Every 2 weeks?  Every 3?  And what are your other infusion dates?  Just trying to stay on top of things. Shout out to KathyL hoping the se creepy crawlies are outta town! Jenny--Congratulations on your new boob in a box!  Wear it proudly, girl! CHJ--I didn't tip my wig fitter, either.  There was money on the counter, so I think it's right to do so, but I got a phone call just as we were finishing and she left me to chat and then it didn't seem as easy to give a tip later.  I felt a little guilty about it, but I really don't like my wig (which isn't really her fault, but she gets the blame).  You should do what feels best/comfortable to you.  You also asked about taking the Pepcid with your other rx's.  I take Pepcid in addition to whatever else my doc has me on.  If I didn't, I'd have heartburn problems that turn me into a moaning animal.  My onc seems totally unconcerned that I'm popping Colace, Pepcid, Max Strength Tylenol, Tylenol PM, whatever on my own.  So I'm doing what I have to do to stay comfortable.  I can't help you with the port question, but you'll hear from others. DianeB--So you're on the CMF!  I really hope this goes better for you.  Carol seems to be doing really well on it.  Hopefully the lightheadedness will pass soon.  It's probably because you're so relieved to be getting on with your tx in a tolerable fashion!  Do me a favor and give me the details of your tx so I can put them in the header.  Thanks. LJ13--I cannot believe you're already through tx#3.  Good for you!  I hope your dark days are lighter this time. SIS Kimberly--as I type this, I imagine you're being buzzed.  I hope you're having fun with it.  Post pix!!!! Today has been good so far.  Went to the gym and rode the recumbent bike for 30 mins and then did some weight-training.  I also incorporated my new p/t exercises into my routine.  It made me very happy to be there.  I'm hoping that next week I can crank it back up to my normal cardio workout--I'm just not into overkill right away. Only bad thing is that I notice a black mark on my thumbnail.  It's the size of a pin prick, but I see it.  I wonder if that's a sign of things to come??????? Guess I should shower! TTFN, D1",

I cannot believe the hassle you went thru in the ED.  Sounds like you and the dh did all the right things, though.  You just try to relax and get your counts up. Hey, why don't you have your dh call a friend and ask her to go out and buy each of your kids a beanie baby or some stuffed animal and have the dh give it to the kids from you.  He can tell them how sad it made you to have to go to the hospital without a goodby and that they should tell their animal all about their fears/concerns/funny stories/whatever in your absence and then have the \"animals\" relay all the stuff the kids told them when you come back home.  That way your kids don't have to bottle stuff up that they'd share with you.  Sometimes that \"mom\" substitute thing works with young kids.  Just an idea.  (Might make you feel better, too!) Start feeling better and get that little diarrhea butt of yours back home. Thinking of you. D1",

I was overwhelmed with thoughts of my sisters who had tx this week when I woke up.  All I could think about was how sh*tty I felt last weekend and I know you will all be going through that this weekend and I'm so sorry.  But the good news is that it will pass and you will wake up next Saturday and feel so much better!  Try to relax and rest and let your body get through this.  Keep drinking, eat when you can (small amounts), take your meds (prescribed and OTC), and smile when you can.  We're all here, pulling for you. SIS Kimberly--You make me smile with the sunshine you're spreading.  I'm excited to see your pix.  Thanks for sharing your happy day with us. Jenn51--You're smart to try to take it slower.  That was a change I made with my second tx and I think it was a better way to go.  I also agree with sista2 about your arm.  I had the most gawdawful time with fluid buildup (seroma) in my pit and in my boob.  I had to get aspirated (with a needle!!!!) several times a week for about 6 weeks (I never had a drain--probably should have).  The seroma is not dangerous, but SERIOUSLY uncomfortable.  Eventually, the body does sort it all out, but see your surgeon for some relief till it does. Julie--You sound good and ready to fight the battle this second time around.  FUSE!!!! Diana63--Good to hear from you.  I'm sorry you're still having trouble with your insurance company.  It's not like we don't have enough stress with this.  Hope the se's from tx#2 are mild. Deb--I'm SO sorry you were postponed.  I think that would just set me off.  You sound like you're handling it well.  I dug out my Lab Value Reference Guide from my onc (of course, he never gives me my lab results, so I've never been able to do any comparisons, but that's another story...).  Here's what it says: Test                                                        Normal range  WBC (white blood cell)                              4.8-10.8 RBC (red blood cell)                                   4.2-5.4 HGB (hemoglobin)                                     12.0-16.0 HCT (hematocrit)                                       37.0-47.0 PLT (platelet)                                            130-400 (100 for chemo pat) GRAN# (absolute neutrophil count)            1.8-7.8 (1.5 for chemo pat) Hope that helps. Vettegal--Hooray, you made it thru the first night!!!  Hopefully, you'll be on your steroid high today and have a good time with the shaving party (I totally understand the desire to be in control--the hair falling out was kinda dramatic in a sad way).  I'm totally into the bandana thing. PALady--I can see you're still smiling after tx#2--hope it stays that way. JackieB--Welcome to our group!  You sound so well-prepared--that's a good thing.  Just try to relax as you head in to Thursday.  The infusion itself is really much easier than you think.  The anticipation is the killer!  And I'm so happy to hear you have such a supportive boss.  How refreshing after all the not so great stories so many of our sisters have shared.  Stop in often--we're always here! Take care, Jewels. FUSE!!!!!! D1",

PALady--In addition to the Biotene mouthwash (which I use morning and night), I added gargling with a baking soda/water mixture (I didn't measure, just dumped) a couple of times during the day to my regimen and it seemed to help the mouthsores.  Worth a try. CarolC--I hate computer issues.  I wish a speedy resolution for you.  Sounds like your shaving party will be soon.  Post pictures! KathyL--I'll bet you're off being the Boobsie Twins about now.  Hope you're having a good time on your good day.  I agree--no bubble living!  Oh, and the facial swelling thing has been such a boon for me (my wrinkles have all but disappeared!), that I haven't complained about that se! Carol--It made me so sad to read about the deaths of two people so close to you in such a short time.  I'm so sorry. SIS Kimberly--Man, how I LOVE that steroid high!!!  I have fingers crossed that your crash won't burn! WVgirl--Oh please don't give up, yet.  Maybe take the phone off the hook next time... Vettegal and KathyL--I was told not to use tampons to avoid tearing myself putting them in/taking them out (tear could lead to infection).  My logic was \"I'm already bleeding, who would know if I tore something?\"  Compound that with the fact that I had NEVER used pads before and I was bound and determined to use tampons for my last period.  So I used tampons.  As far as I can tell, there were no ill-effects.  (I was diligent about using the right size of tampon, however.  With teenaged girls in the house we have such an assortment, one doesn't really have an excuse to use too much tampon for the job--if you know what I mean.) Ah, Joan, I thought you had that knowing look about you!!!  Now go pop that neulasta cherry!  And minimal se's, please!!! Kris--thanks for the info for the header.  I made changes, so you'll have to double-check my work when you get a chance.  I'm sorry to hear you're feeling yucky.  Some ideas to try for your \"rock\" are:  if the rock is heartburn related, pop a Pepcid AC.  I take them preventatively Days 1-14 of my cycle.  If the rock is constipation related, try Colace or others here like Miralax.  I take the Colace on a preventative basis Days 1-5 (gives you the most horrendous gas, though, so be forewarned).  You may also want to scroll back through this thread for other ideas to combat se's.  We seem to be chock full of good ideas here. LJ13--I'm confused when you write you're having reconstruction with your lumpectomy.  For my lumps, they just sewed me up afterward.  If that's what you're having done, the lump recovery is really a breeze.  In 3-4 days (depending on how you handle pain), that part will be fine.  More difficult is the recovery from the node surgery.  Since my lump was at 10 o'clock on my breast, my node surgery was done with a separate incision.  If your lump is nearer to your armpit, you may just have one incision (reference Vettegal's experience).  There is more pain for the node part, so if you don't tolerate pain well, you may need to add another day to be out.  I will say use lots and lots of ice.  I do not suggest that casually--I mean it!  You may also want to bring something home from your job to work on, just in case you need a little time.  I think you'll find being on the computer isn't that hard, as long as you take breaks and use ice on your breaks.  (I have one of those gel-filled pouches that athletes use that never freeze solidly so it conformed to whatever I needed.  If you can find one, I recommend it over something that's hard and solid.)  In all honesty, based on what I know of you from here, you're gonna do just fine. CHJ--Don't forget to shoot us pix of your hairapy session!!! Carol--SO Excited to get my t-shirt.  I'll wear it proudly at my infusion next week!!!  Thanks! My day is good.  I still love my physical therapist and may marry her when I grow up so I can have a massage every day.  Ummmm.  I have developed several large zits on my neck, scalp and forehead that have me pissed off (I'm too old for that!).  I also notice that my pointer finger knuckles are red and burn today.  Probably neuropathy.  It will pass... Onward! D1",

Visit with college girl was great, thanks for asking.  She was so happy to see us and happier still to eat out (she ordered the steak!).  It was cute when we left her dorm as her friends came out of their rooms and she told them about the steak.  They were all squealing and telling her how jealous they were.  Bad news, is that she wants to come home next weekend (she's already scheduled to come home the weekend of the 15th--she has some doc's appts lined up) cuz some of her high school pals will be here.  That will be my shitty weekend.  AND, she wants to take the car my girls share back to school with her for the week of the 11th so she can drive herself home on the 15th.  That means my little one and I have to share a car that week (and I have p/t, and bloodwork to be done during the day).  I know we can all suck it up and accommodate her, but when do they go to school and stay there?????  Whoa, there's a vent from a loving mom (contesting you for the title, KathyL!). Speaking of KathyL, I'm so sorry that you didn't get to have a good week before your next tx.  I think your hospital visit put you back some.  Next time you'll get your good week, you sure deserve it.  I'll bet you do have some iron deficiency.  I'm really pale, too, and dizzy when I get up too fast sometimes, but with your new history, I'd be suspicious.  Call your case nurse tomorrow and describe the symtoms you think point to low iron and ask her if there's anything you can do/take to keep your tx's on schedule.  Maybe YOU need the steak!  (It really looked good--I was jealous.) SIS Kimberly, sounds like you got nailed the second time around.  That certainly sucks.  I find it funny that you're eating eggs, too.  For about 5 days I think I eat like 2-3 of them each day.  They taste good and are about the only protein I can handle.  I make myself a half an egg sandwich with a thin slice of cheddar cheese on toast when I want a bigger treat.  Try it. :) Paula--you sound great for a gal in \"se weekend.\"  Good for you. Oh Sunshine, I'm sorry to hear you're hurting.  Days 4 and 5 (okay, actually, days 3.5 thru 5.5) are my worst, too.  Hang in there, it will pass. Carol--You'll be happy to have the shorter hair.  My Katie Holmes 'do allowed me to pull out hair by the fistful, which I found oddly fascinating.  But it made such a mess.  I think shorter hair won't be so noticeable.  You'll have to let us know.  I'll order another shirt, if you need to boost the count to get to 6.  Put me on the list for a large this time. WVgirl--Perhaps you struck a chord with your dh and that's why you \"made him mad.\"  Now give it some time to resonate with him.  Sometimes we get mad because we see some truth in what our SO's are saying, but don't want to admit it.  He may never admit it, but he may give you more snuggle time.  Keep an eye on it.  In the meantime, get bunches of hugs from your brother! Deb--you sound good and like you're managing your se's well.  Keep it up! Vettegal--as you can see, we're all different.  My head got kinda numb on day 14 as a few hairs started coming out.  By the next day, I could yank out handfuls.  Also, on that day my hair felt like I'd had a ponytail in that was too tight and I'd just taken it out.  You know, that kinda sore feeling, but not bad.  Since you're already shorn, your experience might be a little different, and probably not as dramatic.  Please report.  As for tastebuds, mine are off for at least 10 days, and even after that I sometimes notice things aren't quite right.  The whole taste thing has been strange, to say the least. Jackieb you warrior, you!  Going back to work tomorrow.  I hope you don't get too tired.  Pay attention to your body and do what it says.  We don't need you getting sick. PALady--I crave salt, too!  I think it's cuz it's something I can taste, even when my tongue is loaded with blisters. And sista2, I lol when I read that you're on day 11 and thinking a week from now you won't have hair.  How right you are, girlfriend!!!  Don't worry, it's really not as bad as we all think it will be. Oh, and I made two chocolate cakes for the dh.  One we are eating here, and a chocolate fudge cake (it was more like a fudge brownie--OMG!) that we took up to share with college girl.  Problem is, being the good parent, I left the remains of that cake with college girl.  I sure could use that one back!!! ;) Thanks, LJ13, for the reminders about super bowl parties.  My 16yo and I are having a private one (college girl at college and dh on his way to Portland till Tuesday), so I'm making her favorite cream cheese and salsa dip to go with our Pedernales chili (dh got up and made that this morning--have to have it now as I can't eat spicy for about the next two weeks!).  When I keep reaching for another chip, I'll try to remember your wise words!  (But there's salt on them thar chips!!!!) You guys are the greatest. D1",

Anyway, infusion went much better today--I was only there 6 hours and that included time to see my onc and the 1 1/2 hour wait for my bloodwork to crawl it's way up to the chemo lounge.  They added Benedryl, Ativan and Pepcid to my cocktail to avoid another reaction.  I'm not too happy about it as it makes me sleepy, but it's better to avoid the reactions, so...  My onc is also going to try weaning me off the steriods a little more slowly so now I will take one decadron on Fri and Sat, and then I have to cut those teeny suckers in half to take a half one on Sun (this is in addition to the 4 I take the day before, day of and day after).  He's thinking it may cut down on the joint/bone pain some.  I'm willing to try it, if it works!  So now I begin my \"avoid se dance,\" hopefully I'll do even better this time around! Quick shouts to CHJ, CarolC, LJ13, Maz, Sista2, and DianeB who all are bellying up to the bar tomorrow (I hope I haven't missed anyone..).  Good luck ladies, we're holding our glasses up in a toast to you! DianeB--good luck with the new cocktail.  I've heard the se's are a bit better with CMF, and that is my wish for you. (Would you please give me your CMF infusion dates for the header?  Thx.) Welcome Tinalee--got your info on the header.  Please check for accuracy. Okay, I'm using the backspace key more than any other, so its time for a break. TTFN. D1",

The wind knocked our power out for much of the day, yesty, so no visits with the Jewels for me.  Kinda bummed me out, but I just read and lounged on the sofa, instead.  SEs don't seem quite as bad this time (although I'm having a heck of a time with neuropathy this time around, my hands are totally of another body!).  I think my switch from \"I can do chemo and everything else\" to \"I think I'll just rest for a couple of days after chemo\" was the ticket.  I'll save all the energetic stuff for the end of this week and the next two weeks.  I will say I am so totally and completely exhausted, tho.  I'm starting to believe the folks who say the exhaustion is cumulative... Hints from this experience:  talked to my onc about using Claritin for the bone pain.  He urged me not to use it because one se I'm having trouble with is the dryness in my nose (it bleeds), my eyes, and my skin.  He thought the Claritin would make that worse.  So if you're having dryness issues, you may want to think about that.  This time around I was \"weaned\" off the decadron.  Last 2 times I took 2 pills 2x a day for the day before, day of and day after.  It seems to me that several of us are doing that here.  Well, he added one pill on days 3 and 4 in the morning and I took 1/2 pill in the morning on day 5.  It might be my imagination, but I didn't seem to crash and burn so badly this time (we'll see how today goes, as its the first day with no decadron), and my bone pain wasn't quite as bad (maybe I'm just getting used to it).  Anyway, for those troubled by the crash and burn of steroids, there's another idea for ya. Maz, I'm addicted to the bonus gifts from Clinique and had saved up I don't know how much of that moisturizing lotion they have in the little sample bottles, but that stuff is working wonders on my head (not sure why I tried it in the first place, but hey!).  I've never used their lotion (I use a Neutrogena product on my face), but since I'm having trouble with peeling and dryness on my face, I thought the Neutrogena stuff that fights wrinkles (I think it has retin-a or something in it) would be too harsh, so I got out the Clinique.  Now I just slather the Clinique on my face, head and neck and I'm doing great.  It's not causing pimples, either (the first lotion I tried made me break out--not a pretty sight). SIS Kimberly--I don't know how many times I said, \"OMG!\" and LOL when I saw the pic of you flying.  Thanks for a great belly laugh! Julie--the cake is so cool!  (How did you get so smart to be able to insert stuff like that???) Hmm.  Sorry guys, getting a little drifty (I DO wonder if that's a se from the added steroids--I've been kinda out of it since tx day and don't know why).  I find my attention span is worse than a gnat's.  So Ima go and do something else for a while. Chocolate cake is on the counter and I'm hoping I can restrain myself till the family is around to share it with me!!! Oh happy day!! D1",

Went to the gym and it appears that all the exercises my pt has added for my spasms and sciatic nerve have caused my routine to balloon to a 2 hour commitment!  When I'm done with all this bc business, I'm only going to be able to get a part time job so I have time for all my exercises! After the gym I went to pt.  My usual pt was unremarkable (although I still do moan and drool when she gives me the butt massage), but my visit with my lymphedema specialist was great.  She taught me how to use massage to encourage my fluid to travel to other lymph nodes.  While massaging me, she noted that I have a lot of fluid along my torso on the side and around on my shoulder blade.  I'm hoping these techniques will get it moving to more receptive lymph nodes.  She also said I might be a good candidate for a compression garment (that sure sounds fun) to keep myself from ballooning up.  Unfortunately, I think I have a pretty serious problem with the le, but I'm hopeful that this gal will be able to teach me how to manage it so I don't end up with an elephant arm! Then I managed to get the Tea Tree Oil.  I'm afraid to open it as the clerk at GNC said it really smells bad.  I'm hoping it will keep my nails on my fingers and toes... Tonight are District semi-finals for my daughter's bball team.  She got 7 minutes on Monday in the first round, but I'm not too sure about tonight (her team has played their opponent twice during the regular season and she didn't get in to either game--bummer).  I really feel for her this year.  Last year she was 7th/8th man, which for a sophomore on varsity was really good.  This year, they got a new coach.  Only one player graduated last year, so it's essentially the same team, but now my kid is the last one to go in, if she plays at all.  We're just not sure what happened.  And it's been really weird cause the other parents started calling my dh and me about a month ago to pass along that their daughters tell them that my dd is a \"beast\" (that's good) at practice and that they don't know why the coach doesn't play her.  I think my kid must've done something early in the season to piss the coach off and now she's paying for it.  Which is too bad cause over the years all we've ever heard from coaches is what a pleasure it is to have our kid on the team.  Who knows.  Well, there's a non-bc vent for ya.  Best get to my shout-outs cause I'm imagining Kris in a ball on the floor... Kris--OMG.  It makes me sad to read about your pain.  I agree with Wendy, SIS Kimberly and KathyL, dig out the painkillers from surgery and take them (I did this when I couldn't get my back under control the first time).  You should not be in that much pain.  Also, try laying flat on your back and pull your knees up to your chin and hold them there with your arms around your legs.  Kinda like the fetal position, except you're on your back.  The stretch seems to alleviate my pain a little.  I will say I've gotten better at managing the pain with every tx.  I discovered that I can't do any exerting from the day I get the neulasta shot till after I pass the spasm day (I get the shot on Friday and have spasms the following Wednesday like clockwork).  From Friday to Wednesday I use the heating pad whenever I sit and I don't do any exercise or much walking.  Even tho I feel \"okay\" on Monday and Tuesday, I really try to lay around till after Wednesday.  Maybe that will help you next time.  And get the max str. tylenol and tylenol pm.  They don't make the pain go away, but I figure it must be lessening it. Joan--Hooray, you're halfway done!!!  Hope your se's aren't too bad. KathyL--good luck with that potty-training.  I remember many things fondly from my girls' toddler years, but potty-training is not one of them.  I was just happy to get through that! PALady--I'm sorry you're achier this time.  Are you staying on the Maximum Strength Tylenol to manage that?  (No, I do not work for Tylenol.)  Hope you're feeling better. Get more money for teachers, SIS Kimberly!!!! g2g.  Gotta fix my dd dinner before she catches the bus to her game. D1",

Oh, and I keep forgetting to pile on to Sheshe's description of Vernor's.  It's ginger ale.  Best ginger ale going, if you ask me.  I sure have been drinking a lot of it lately!  :) Okay, now I have to seriously get in the shower...

KathyL--thanks ever so much for the info on cording.  It really calmed me as I waited for my appointment this morning and all you said completely jived with what my le therapist said (give yourself more credit!).  The only difference in my situation is that my snap on Sat. was my cord forming.  The next snap will be when it goes away.  I do have some stretching exercises to try to regain some of the ground I lost there.  I also ordered my sleeve today, and she thinks that next week she wants to try bandaging me for several days in a row to see if we can get my swelling down.  She's going to talk to my surgeon about it to get the proper scripts written.  I see her again on Thursday, so she'll let me know what my doc said then.  Kinda cool to have my own little advocate inside the system... Diana63--your encouragement about tx4 couldn't come at a better time.  There are 4 of us getting #4 this week.  Thanks. Dana--Guess I should hop up and do the hokey pokey, too!  Let us know how it goes. Welcome back from the fog, Joan.  It sounds like your family visits were healing for you.  I hope your mom does well in her new environment.  Enjoy your good days! Kalen--your feelings sound so familiar.  The anticipation before the first one is really the worst part about that whole tx.  Just put a smile on your face and one foot in front of the other and soon you'll be done.  And you're beating cancer!!  How cool is that???!  FUBC! Judy, yeah, it takes me 8 days to come out of the fog, too.  Just try to be patient (you can write that to me next week).  I'm not sure about your red spots, I was thinking dry skin or acne.  You do need to lotion your balditude (I'm having good luck with Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion).  You may want to shave the rest (the control thing SIS Kimberly describes) just so when you lotion you don't end up with greasy hair hanging out of your bandanna.  (But, hey, if you like the hair out of the bandanna, then keep it--it's your head and your choice.  How refreshing at a time when we get so few choices, huh?) Okay, KathyL and Maz--grab my hands and let's go f*ck up some cancer tomorrow!!!  FUBC!!!!!!!! D1",

First of all, he's no McDreamy, but this is the cutest doc I've ever had.  He's been doing breast rads since 2000, so he's quite young (also new for me, but I guess at 50 I should get used to that).  And he has a fab sense of humor!!! Upshot of my case is that he said they try to give the lowest rads possible to patients, but because I have lymph node involvement, I get a little extra (lucky me).  I have 6 weeks' worth--5 days a week.  He said that by week 5 I will have a burn so bad that I won't want to wear clothing for a few weeks till it heals, but that he uses creams and salves that they currently use for serious burn victims, so we'll do the best we can to manage that.  He said my skin will be compromised, but he strongly recommends against any cosmetic fixes to my breast till after because rads will change my breast.  If I fix it now, I'll probably end up fixing the fixes!  He said that because my lump was on the top of my breast, I should still be able to get things tidied up and be happy with the result.  (Good tumor placement--yay me!)  I will have two, maybe three rad sites (they will give me permanent tattoos for those) one or two on my breast and one in my lymph area (armpit).  From what he can tell of my angles, I can expect to lose 10% of my lung capacity (it may come back with time, but no assurances), and increased risk of rib fractures under my left breast.  My heart will not be radiated at all, so I run no risk there.  We talked about alternative positions during rads (ie. I lay on my tummy to save my lungs), but with my angles, he thinks I receive no benefit.  The part that brought tears to my eyes was when he said my rad regimen will certainly exacerbate my le and he said I could have irreversible swelling.  He was pleased that I was already seeing a le specialist and encouraged me to keep it up (I think he'll most def help me get extensions for that), to try to do whatever I can to save my arm.  So that part is pretty f*cked up, but what can I do about it??  I'm going to be as aggressive as I can on the le for the next month to try to be in the best possible shape and hope and pray that my karma is good for this.  He said he'd call me Monday to go over the tests/scans he wants me to have.  (I took my reports and disks in with me and by the time he sat me in his office, he'd already seen the spot on my lung and wanted to make sure that was okay!)  I liked this guy enough that I'm not even going to interview anyone else.  And I only had a couple of spasms during my appointment, so I take that as a good sign. That's the story so far.  I'll let you all know what happens after he calls on Monday. LJ13--so glad to hear you barely feel you're on chemo anymore!  That has to be good news for those following you on to Taxol.  Do you really go in every week for tx?  Or do we have it wrong on the header?  If you do, I think you're headed to the bar tomorrow, right?  If so, bottoms up! Also, FUBCs to Julie, Tinalee (first T), AZDonna (first T), and Sista2 (last AC)!  Go get um tomorrow Jewels!!! Hope everyone is doing okay today. D1",

OMG SIS Kimberly, are you SURE you don't have another calling in life???  I would never give myself enough credit for divining that women in burkas are oppressed (which we all know they ARE) and that there could be a connection to my med situation.  The magazine thing is weird, but maybe that's because I've only really been reading mags during this ride as I can't focus on a book (my normal read).  Certainly food for thought.  Fortunately, she didn't ring me up last night! Hey LWDana!  Lovin' those 'roids, are ya?  Watch yourself when you stop taking them--I really crashed hard.  It wasn't till after my 2nd tx that we figured out that I was the type that had to be weaned from them, which really helped.  So pay attention and if you're a hard crasher, talk to your onc about a weaning program.  Hang in there and give yourself lots of room to just lay around and watch tv.  Drink, drink, drink!!!!! I know I'm a little late to the party (you guys started talking about this while I was in my fog), but I want to jump on the pro-educators bandwagon.  Both of my inlaws and one of my sisters are in education.  They work a whole lot harder than I ever do.  My sister used to teach elementary kids, but got sick of the parents after 15 years and went back to get a 2nd masters in library.  Now she's an elementary librarian.  She also volunteers her time to establish literacy centers on one of the out-islands in the Bahamas (long story, but we spent a good part of our wonder years on Eleuthera, going to school and learning about life outside of our lucky one in the States).  Now my sis is trying to give back to a population that gave so much to us.  I've been down to help her once and her work is amazing (fortunately, I was the parent volunteer in our elem's computer lab for something like 8 years when my two were younger, so I have a decent background in being a \"teaching aide\"--you know, the type that works well with careful supervision).  She was just down in one of the centers we put together two years ago and found the lawnmower in the library!  (The librarian'd left and no one stepped up, so...)  Anyway, she and the janitress cleaned everything out and recataloged the new materials my sis took down and the janitress was so good my sis went to the principal who agreed to promote her to librarian!  We both know this woman from childhood and agree she's going to work really hard to make this center work, so it was a huge success!  While she's there, she also does distance learning with some of her schools in WI.  She has the island kids prepare reports on something unique to the island and the WI teachers have their students do reports on stuff Wisconsin and they hook up via internet.  I helped her with one of these one time.  They're amazing!  I just can't wait to get better so I can go down and assist her again (although I can do without the sand flea bites I know I'll get working in those dirty libraries!  Oh, and not to mention the critters we encounter--I really hate that part!).  But it's cool.  Next time, maybe I'll bore you all with how our high school teachers use the internet to post homework/grades here... So today I get my last p/t for my back spasms and I see my le specialist.  I'm going through my 12-step program of acceptance on the le/rads thing and now I'm in the angry phase, which makes me wanna work hard to get my le under control before I start my rads. Oh, and I forgot to tell you all about the prognosis for my nipple.  The rad onc said it was going to bear the brunt of the burn/pain for my breast and that I would not want to wear clothing for about a month starting somewhere around week 5 of rads.  His positive spin on it was that the weather would be nice for me to run around topless, but it was just another fun sounding se to me.  Hopefully, he's painting the worst case scenario for me and it won't really be that bad... Okay, I'll move on.  :) D1",

I'm so sorry you missed the service, KathyL, but sometimes it sucks to be adultish and have to make what you know is the smart choice.  We all know your spirit was there, though, so please don't feel that your physical presence was a requirement.  Also--really appreciated your thoughts on the skin care.  My le specialist (I'm going to have to come up with a shorter way to type that) also suggested that I ask if there's something I can be using now to prep my skin to make sure the elasticity is at an all time high when I start.  I'm amassing quite a list to talk over with my radonc when he calls on Monday! Sheshe--get thyself to a le specialist (there I go again)!!!  Anything that is considered a chronic condition must receive our attention. Oh LWDana-a-a-a-a!  Sounds to D1 like you're burning your candle at both ends.  Listen to your body and respect what it tells you.  You cannot afford to make yourself sick (let the chemo take care of that :) ).  Build some rest into that schedule, please. SIS Kimberly--Ditto to you, my friend.  Once again, that dance card is full, full, full.  Remember what I told you last cycle--accept some slow dances.  Oh, and you can rant any old time.  I always learn so much from them.  I found the info on the HT drugs fascinating, but sadly, not surprising. CathyCA--I don't think I've told you, but I find you truly an inspiration.  You sound like you made a decision similar to mine, which is to be home while the kids are in high school.  They really do need the monitoring then, even tho they say they don't like it.  Besides, being there when they come in the door to toss their backpacks on the floor is the only time they share an inkling of what they did all day.  I always loved getting them snacks while they poured themselves a drink because they always told me stuff even tho they didn't think they were talking to me.  Hope those truffles were a hit.  I can't imagine cooking anything right now--it would be so unsatisfactory because I can't taste...  And thanks for the info on the cream and the Expand-a-Bands.  Like I said earlier, I'm compiling a list of things to check with my new doc and your ideas are there! Good to hear from you, Deb.  I know what you mean about the crying thing.  My family is having a hard time adjusting to the waterworks me.  It's always at it's worst the 10 days after tx, so I'm curious to see if I'll dry up and return to my more stoic self.  I will say the cries are sometimes cathartic, so don't beat yourself up over them.  You're going through an awful lot right now (on top of the bc, you're helping your dp deal with her loss, no small thing), so give yourself room.  Oh, and I can't peel an orange at all--my dead fingernails are so painful.  I can't even pick my nose.  (Okay, that's probably a good thing.)  Focus on your good stuff--heck, you're done with AC!!!!! WVgirl--sounds like you're going to win the med appt frenzy next week.  Be sure you keep us updated.  I need to redouble my efforts in sending sensitivity vibes to your dh/DH.  I'm sorry you're experiencing pain in your relationship.  I'm thinking of you. Yeah, Carol, I'm trying to figure out a way to work le massage into foreplay without it appearing too greedy on my part.  I'm thinking that would be a win-win.  I've been in my relationship/marriage for almost 31 years now, so you know what that means in the intimacy department...  Can I make this le lemon into lemonade????  Stay tuned. Since Vettegal has offered to buy the first round tomorrow, I'm thinking that takes me off the hook, but please know I'll call out to Vettegal, PALady, WVgirl and Peg1212 as I'm headed off to get my college girl.  Hey, Vettegal and PALady, I'll even be in your state!!!  I'll toot my horn in your honor as I cross the state line.  Good luck tomorrow.

      "Content": "Mar 19, 2008 08:28AM Determined1 wrote: Good morning, Jewels and Happiest of New Years!!!  (Thanks CathyCA.) Maz, I'm so sorry to read about your friend.  A friend of ours was dx'd with colon cancer that's riddled his body in January and it really got me down (particularly as it came at a time I was just getting started with chemo).  His kids are the same ages as ours and we've shared a lot over the years.  His docs are trying to figure out how to make him comfortable (code for he's not long with us).  I decided to use his battle with cancer as a marker for my own--you know, that reminder that as bad as I think I have it, he will always have it worse, so I should try to keep smiling.  It has also inspired me to remind (or nag as my kids would say) others to get their exams done--be it mammos, self-breast exams, or in Richard's case, a colonoscopy.  The best thing I can do is to educate others.  I know your friend would want you to take something positive away from her situation.  Your challenge will be to figure out what that is and then act on it.  Do give yourself time to grieve for her suffering (I'm sure she has grieved for yours), but then wrest as much control as you can from the situation and make it good.  Oh, and your aunt is with you every step of the way, never doubt it.  (You should see all the times my dad comes through for me and he's been gone for almost 7 years!  Couldn't live without him.)  Chin up, Maz. Hey Julie, hope you had fun at your happy hour.  You sound fabulous--I'm happy for you. Oh man, Sheshe, you're probably right about the fake sugars.  I have never trusted them.  When I drink a soda, (which is almost never), I always drink them fully loaded.  It sounds like the wedding planning is just the distraction you need.  I think it really helps to have something going on so we don't dwell on cancer.  Stay happy and keep healing. KathyL--Oh, I remember how hard it was to prep for the last one.  I had to force my hand to my mouth to take my 'roids.  Keep marching, though, it will be over.  I think your docs are doing to you what mine did to me with the taxotere--my infusions were all a minimum of 6 hours after my reaction (you may recall that I had one 9 hour marathon!).  God forbid we miss a moment of se fun with a lower dose!  Slowing it down will help lessen the body's reactions, so a little less drama in the chemo suite, but it requires the patience of a million women.  Just take stuff to distract you.  You can do this, you can do this.  I'll be with you all day.  I'll have someone look at my nail today when I'm at the hospital for my le massage.  Although where it bled out it looks much better--it's now red, not purpley-black.  Maybe they'll all bleed out as the black part gets to the top of the nail.  We'll see. SIS Kimberly--what a loving post to CarolC, thank you.  Hope you continue to come back to us from your fog. Oh, CHJ, another sapphire.  And you have so much on your plate, no wonder you're feeling some pressure.  Take the damn wig off (mine has been relegated to the back of my closet) and tie a pretty scarf over your balditude (the cotton ones work the best--don't slip off like the silk ones) and go to work.  F*ck em if they can't take a joke. Our LWDana--keep on fighting, sweetie. Deb--Hang in there.  Are the hands any better today?  I remember telling my dh that he could just cut mine off and I'd probably never miss them.  It will improve. OMG Paula, LOL at Mr. Chainsaw Massacre!!!! So Carol, why on earth do you have a squirrel feeder????  Those doggone rats with fuzzy tails!  I think you need another day at the spa to relieve the pain from your knot! Tinalee, you cracked me up when you called it \"pop.\"  I haven't called it that in years!  Now that I'm a mid-Atlanticer (is that a regional descriptive???) I've switched to soda, but it took me a long time to shake off \"pop.\"  The chili fundraiser sounds like fun, enjoy the generosity of others (I have a hard time with that, too), and drink lots of pop! Today I see my legu and then my mom wants to take my gf to lunch to thank her for all the times she has toted me to doc appts, and THEN we're driving up to take college girl out for dinner!  A VERY full day for me.  I'll toot the horn as I pass into PA again--Vettegal and PALady be listening for me!!!! Thinking about KathyL and Maz all day today.  Bottoms up, gals! D1",

Oh Carol, you are SUCH a hottie!  Thanks for the pix.  Please enjoy your cation.  We'll all get our day in the sun (looks like you're getting a weeks' worth--lucky duck), so smile girlfriend.  And please don't expect me to check in at all when I take my turn!  :) SIS Kimberly--Hope you learned a lot yesterday, in addition to collecting all those hugs from your students.  AVID sounds like a cool program.  It makes me wonder if we have something like that here... You know, all those steroids make us a little swollen, but I've noticed that it doesn't seem to be going down on me this time.  Yes, the elastic marks have been a giveaway for me.  But I'm also noticing that I can't see my ankle bones anymore and it kinda hurts to walk sometimes (I try not to let it stop me, though).  Its funny, my ankles look more swollen than the areas where the le is a problem. Have yourself a great time in Tahoe!  And, boy, you had me LOL with your letter about the mammo.  :) Paula--Hope you get some sleep tonight after watching the ds pitch his heart out.  And what's with the Mountaineers?  The HAD that game! PALady--Yeah, I think the compression jeans are all the rage around these boards! Jenn--Sorry to hear that you've been a sapphire lately.  And to add your co-worker's situation doesn't help.  At least you still have your sense of humor.  You had me lol that boasting about not having a se is a sure-fire way to get it!  (How true.) Judy--Another sapphire.  That tx#3 has kicked a lot of us in the teeth.  And \"the cough\" to boot.  I know its a long drive to the onc, but its probably a good thing to check everything out.  Burn a good CD and sing all 500 miles. Sheshe--OMG!!!  My fingers are crossed that there's no infection.  Will they put your picc line back in for the remainder of your tx? Vettegal--How awful for your chemo suitemate.  Good thing you brought her to the Boards--sounds like she'll need the support.  Oh, and you sure sound like the BRCA test poster girl... Dana--I got one of those mammo time letters, too.  Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling as spunky as SIS Kimberly at the time, so I just pitched mine...  Hope you're doing okay today. KathyL--I know I could not handle little kids a week after tx4--you are simply amazing!  Or as SIS Kimberly would say (and did as I continued reading the thread) you are truly a SHERO!!  Get rid of that cough! Hey Julie, don't get lost in the mist for long... Kalen--How good to see you dropping by!!  What a good egg you are to welcome Vettegal's suitemate to your thread.  Hope you're doing well. CHJ--Hang in there.  It does sound like you have a case of chemo brain, though.  Maybe the dh should handle the bill paying for a while... As always, good job, LJ13! So, here's my deal.  I went to see my surgeon's partner today for the cyst draining.  Met a friend for lunch beforehand and had a glass of pinot gris, just to prepare!  Anyway, doc felt the spot and then examined my MRI.  She thinks its probably scar tissue.  Even if it's not scar tissue, she didn't drain it because I have le and inserting a needle in my le zone risks infection and le complications.  Her advice was to go ahead and start rads on Monday.  If the rads cause the area to swell and its apparent that it should be drained, we'll take the risk at that time.  That will mean a break in my rad schedule, but she thinks that's a more prudent way to go for now.  So no needles today (you guys clearly have STRONG thought waves.  You were going for a small needle, but I didn't get one at all!  Thanks, gang!).  This doc did say that if it is scar tissue it should soften with time, suggesting that since I'll be radiating the area it will probably be 2 years (!) before I notice the softening.  That's a long time not to be able to put my arm by my side, but like all my other permanent aches and pains, I guess I'll get used to it.  One thing that made me happy with this is my babydoc called me both yesty and today to update me on what he and my surgeon's partner were thinking about my situation.  Gotta like that. So, off to see college girl this weekend.  She got tix for her and dd to see the band, \"Brand New,\" Sat. nite.  Since dh and I aren't comfortable with our relatively new driver making that trip alone, we're going to drive up there and stay in a hotel and take the girls to brunch on Sunday before driving back.  Hope they have movie theaters or something up there...  (If I'm MIA, that's why--I don't have a laptop, so I can't scratch my Jewel itch when I'm away from home.  Waaaaa.) You can tell it's Friday--the bar is packed!!!  Sending all the best to WVgirl, Deb, Paula, and Dana.  Special thoughts to Vettegal and Peg, who are getting their last round.  Have them give you a little umbrella for your 'tinis to celebrate!!!  FUBC!!!!! Cheers! D1",

Carol, my heart sank when I read that you have 2 more positive nodes.  You said they took two levels--did that clean out your pit, or is there another level lurking?  I can't believe they gave you a copy of your report without a doc's translation.  I couldn't get ANYTHING out of my nurses--the doc had to order all communication with me.  So annoying.  I hope when you talk to your doc that you're going to be able to stay on schedule.  I did loads of waiting, myself, and it was not fun.  I wish a good outcome for you. Kimberly SIS JJ--I think you missed your calling.  There must be a place where poetry like this is published.  Your work deserves to be there.  When is your chemo start date? KathyL, I was glad to hear the MUGA was uneventful.  I'm taking Decadron, too (isn't that one the steroid one?  Can't remember.), but that's the only drug on your list we have in common.  It sounds like you're ready to go, though.  Good for you. Welcome, Twinkly.  You must be in Canada or Europe, taking FEC.  We're happy to have you in our group. Some bad news here.  My oldest daughter, home from college for break, went to the high school to p/u her sister for me today.  On her way, a kid on a scooter shot off the sidewalk into traffic and hit my daughter's car.  He started on the bumper and flew off his bike into her windshield--shattering it with his helmet.  Luckily, he was not hurt (thank God for the helmet), but my daughter is totally traumatized.  The kid is kinda sketchy--told the cops he was 16 so he'd be the legal age to drive the scooter, but turns out he's 14.  Then gave a bogus address to the police.  Our insurance company is warning me that there is probably no insurance on their end, so our uninsured motorist plan will pay for the damages and even tho they say our premium won't increase since it wasn't her fault (fortunately, at least a half dozen people gave statements saying just that), I'm skepical.  And pissed.  Now I have to get the car repaired, get ready for Christmas, go to NYC, and start chemo all in the next week.  Why do I have to be tested so?  Argh.  At least my dh ordered my last meal.  I want ribs from the Rendezvous restaurant in Memphis.  So we're having them delivered.  How extravagant!!! Okay, I'll get off my rant.  Thanks for the read. D1",

Came home to change and went to lunch with the family and actually shopped a bit.  Then off to get my neulasta shot.  Okay, that was not fun (please bear in mind my fear of needles).  That bugger STUNG when it went in.  And I could feel the sting for something like an hour and a half afterward.  The nurse told me that the se's from that injection should come on w/i 24 hours and would make me feel bone and joint pain.  She said if regular doses of max strength tylenol didn't keep it under control that I was to call in.  Sounds manageable, but oddly, I'm intimidated by this shot--not sure why.  She said the achiness should last about 4 days.  During this time, the se's from the chemo itself should start showing up.  Frankly, I'm already seeing those.  So far I can report a robust appetite (can't seem to eat enough), dry mouth (combating that with Biotene, which really seems to work, whereas high fluid intake doesn't seem to help as much), dry eyes (took out the contacts), and so much gas I can hardly stand myself!  And the gas doesn't seem to want to be held in, it just sneaks out like I'm some old person and smells so bad (TMI, I know).  I'd better get this under control or my reputation will be forever soiled!  I did take one colace last night and plan to take another one tonight as I'm a little concerned about constipation (perhaps this is causing the gas?).  I'm not real good with drugs (I usually don't take an aspirin for a headache), but I'm trying here.  Other than these, very manageable se's, I feel like usual.  Gosh, I hope it stays this way! Energy seems to be okay.  In between my running around I've managed to do 6 loads of laundry--including getting the sheets back on my bed.  I'm hoping I'll still be okay in the morning and can get my kid's sheets washed and on before I crap out.  I'll let you know. Carol, glad to hear you got your cocktail.  Very different from mine.  I don't know if it sounds any easier, but I do believe our heads can help us through.  I'm trying to keep mine together!  (Was it ever together???)  When do you see the guy at the Seattle Cancer Center?  Will you do your tx there?  Hope they get you going real soon--I hated the wait.  The anticipation sucks. WVgirl--yay!  You're on your way.  Actually, I'd be a little relieved to get some time to let that port incision heal before you start chemo.  I don't have one, so I can't help you with the \"what to expect\" part of it.  But you sound good and that's most of the battle. Donna1955--you're in the worst part of it--that week before you start.  Try to push it to the back of your mind and live as normally as possible over the next week.  Exercise, drink excessive amounts of wine, and eat too many Christmas cookies (that was my routine!) to take your mind off of it.  The infusion itself wasn't nearly as bad as I'd imagined.  I think the fun is to come, but it's okay so far.  Really it is. Deb--I asked about Emend when I was there.  My nurse told me exactly what LJ13 said about it working in the brain, while the others work in your disgestive system.  She said the stuff I'm on (decadron, Anzumet, with compazine as a backup if needed) is not generally considered as strong as the Emend and if I'm really sick, I should call in and they'll likely give me some of that.   So far I haven't felt any nausea.  In fact, my appetite is heartier than usual.  I take the last of the Anzumet tomorrow and then we'll see how I'm doing.  I'm with LJ13, I do not want to be sick when there are so many drugs out there to combat that se.  You may want to ask if when you go in for your infusion if they plan to give you any anti-nausea meds then.  I got two boosts of the same drugs I'm taking in pill form via my IV.  My sister also got Ativan through her port when she did chemo a couple of years ago, but I specifically asked not to have that as it made her really loopy after tx and I figured there must be something else out there.  She was UBER anxious, too, so that was probably part of the reason.  But do ask what they're going to give you on infusion day--it may be more than just your chemo drugs.  Be your own advocate.  Ask questions. Kimberly--hope you connect with your onc soon (or have already).  Getting the plan in place really brings a peace, even though you know there's some rough road ahead. How ya doin', Vettegal? I'll be back tomorrow to report.  Have a basketball game (my kid's team is in the championship game for the holiday tourney) tonight at 8:15p--hope I can make it to the end of the game! Onward! D1",

Today started out kinda rough.  The arm on which I had all my node surgery felt like it'd been pulled from it's socket (I suspect the Neulasta shot was the culprit).  I got up and popped two max strength tylenol and that did the trick.  I've been okay since.  More tired today, but I have done laundry and vacuumed--although I'm moving a lot more slowly than I usually do.  A friend came by and made us sandwiches for lunch (my family was scattered for whatever reason today) and chatted till I kicked her out as my gas was building up and I didn't want to let them rip in front of her.  (Still have a gas issue--but did have a \"normal\" bm today, so I take that as a good sign.  So do you guys really want to read all of this????)  I have switched from 3 meals today to 5 smaller ones--I ate a regular dinner last night and had that post-Thanksgiving fullness that makes you wonder if it's really nausea.  I wanted to know if it WAS nausea, so I switched to smaller meals.  That seems to be working and I haven't felt nauseous.  I took the last of the Anzumet today, so from here on out I'm flying without the net, so to speak.  If I feel nauseous, I'm supposed to take a compazine \"as needed.\"  Not sure when that will be...  I WILL take max strength tylenol tonight.  I'm still holding it together gang.  Maybe this CAN be done!!! I don't know what CMF is, Carol, but you're on regimen for 6 months.  That seems like a long time to me--I only get 4 tx's all told (well, okay, I get rads and then hormone therapy for 5-10 years after, but only 3 months of chemo-related malarkey).  Do you know for what each of the letters stand?  Maybe we could help you look them up if we know the drug names and see what they do.  It may help you understand why that particular regimen is being recommended. Sherry, who does mammoplasia (copying your spelling)?  Is that something for the ps?  Sounds like something I could use.  My Frankenboob is much smaller/less nipple than good boob and I'd like them to match up somewhat when I'm all done here.  But I'm kinda weary/scared of more surgery.  Maybe a Christmas present for next year...  Glad you got your tx set up.  It's kind of a relief to have a plan, isn't it? SIS Kimberly, I think the steroid thing comes in to play depending on your tx.  It seems a lot of us TC gals are getting the decadron for the day before, day of and day after, including a dose right before the \"T\".  There ARE some potentially nasty se's to the T infusion (luckily, didn't affect me), so that might be the reason.  It's funny, a lot of you talk about Emend, but that's not anything I seem to be getting up front.  I guess it comes down to the experiences your team has had with different drugs and se's in the end (and how well a job those pharmaceutical sales reps are doing!).  I'm sorry you didn't hear from your doc before the weekend, but a boob fill is a nice way to start out the year! Glad you came through infusion day, okay, Yuyubear!  It's really not so bad, is it?  (It's the A-N-T-I-C-I-P-A-T-I-O-N, gang.)  I think the se's from the nasty-lasta shot are more problematic for me right now, but the max strength tylenol seem to be doing the trick, so I'm hanging in.  Make sure you have some on hand (I got the quick action, or whatever it's called and it works fairly quickly). Vettegal, sorry to hear you're not sleeping well.  I had such a hard time with that, myself.  I used multiple pillows in the bed (almost chased out the dh a few times!) and it helped a bit.  Also, go ahead and take max strength tylenol or tylenol pm (never have tried the latter) to help you sleep.  You need all of it now.  Do you get your stitches out soon? Diane63, well, we know what you're doing in the new year, don't we?  My center would not allow me to drive myself from my first treatment till they saw how I reacted.  I'm sure I could drive from subsequent infusions, but I really want my dh and me to own this experience together, so I'm going to make him come with me.  Ask them about it--they may want you to have someone the first time, but let you fly solo after that, if you want.  I don't think it would be a bad thing to be there alone--books/iPod can keep you busy while you're getting your tx, so having a \"Chatty Cathy\" nearby isn't really necessary (unless that's what helps you keep your head in the right place--we're all different).  Bottom line, I'd ask the question. Big day tomorrow--I'm hoping I can hit the treadmill again in the morning (gotta counterbalance the effect of those steroids!  And it really helps my head), then off to get my \"in-between\" haircut.  I'm hoping I'll feel well enough afterward to hop across the street to the mall to make some Christmas returns, but if I don't I'll just skip that.  Then home to watch the Vikings play.  Sounds like a full day to me.  I hope I can keep up with myself! It's all still good, Jewels, keep the faith. Onward. D1",

LJ13, life can be such a bitch.  I CANNOT believe you had a flat tire.  I hope you either have AAA or someone stopped to help you.  (No, I will not share this pain, although you're a star to volunteer, we all have crosses to bear, this is mine.  I think it will make me a better person or something.)

Vettegal--I think that woman at work today was your confirmation.  The world is so mysterious sometimes, isn't it?  Her story was exactly the motivation that steered me to chemo, so by sharing it with us you have reaffirmed my decision, that's for sure.  Are you just exhausted?  Even jobs without \"heavy lifting\" are more tiring than we realize. So, SIS Kimberly, how're the gals lookin'???  Talk about oo-la-la!!! Oh, new weirdness to report.  I have these two bumps on one of my legs and one of them is getting bigger.  It kinda looks like a blister.  I read my stuff and don't see anything about body blisters.  Anyone heard of that?  (Or have I become a hopeless hypochondriac?)

WVgirl--did you take the tylenol pm?  If not, try that one.  Particularly the second night after the neulasta shot, if you're feeling achy.  We gotta sleep! Hang in, Diana63!  Like I suggested to WVgirl, look into Tylenol pm to push the \"acheys\" away and get some rest tonight. (I sound like the tylenol sales rep here!) I agree with LJ13 about the exercise.  My plan is to do something every day that I can.  Today I rode a recumbent bike for 20 mins and did some lifting, but I put my weights back 50% from my normal.  Since I was having those spasms just two days ago, I didn't want to risk too much.  But the point is, we really do need to stay active.  There are so many proven benefits to exercise that its difficult to ignore it.  And I agree that Lance Armstrong is an excellent poster boy. Thanks again, KathyL, for the list.  I will update in my original post as we get more info on our Jewels.  I KNEW that an anal retentive soul (takes one to know one) was right for the job.  Heck, we ARs get sh*t done!  ;) I'll try to check in later to see how our gang is feeling.

Hey, I ordered myself a laptop today from Dell.  Too bad I didn't have it when I was in the chemo lounge, but I'm looking forward to getting it.  I got one of the 17\" screens, so its not really as portable as the smaller ones, but I won't travel far with it (office to family room, I'd guess), so the extra weight of the bigger machine shouldn't be too burdensome.  I'm excited because Dell was offering laptops with XP on them for a short window (mostly you can only get Vista these days, and I haven't read much positive stuff about Vista unless you're a computer geek--which I'm not).  I'm feeling good about my deal, too, as I've been pricing these babies for several months now.  My only disappointment is that I had to get it in black (I wanted red) to get my deal...  It should be here in about 3 weeks! Well, my little one just returned from her guitar lesson.  I'll see what's up with her. Later. D1",

Yes, Maz, cancer really sucks.  It made me happy, though to read you reminiscing about good times.  You know that's what Val wants you to remember.  In fact, maybe you should share your memories with her-smiling about good experiences will make her feel better.  How can it not? Pah-leese, Carol, stop bitching about your hair!!!  You look SOOO good.  (Love the new avatar.) Book arrived this weekend and was waiting on my kitchen counter when I got home from NY this evening.  Thanks. So, I can relate to the skating floor burn.  Dd had 4 games to play in this tournament and 10 minutes in to the first game she came down on another girls' foot wrong and sprained her ankle.  She was out for the duration on Sat.  We iced her down and kept her on anti-inflammatories all night.  This morning she was in tears because we drove 5 hours to get her to the tourney location (not to mention the delay when we ran into the Pope's security detail in NYC-and to think we completely avoided any of that when he was here in DC just days ago!), and she felt badly that she wasn't playing.  Then she was upset because she was letting her teammates down by being hurt when they only had one sub this weekend.  Then she was upset because this tournament was a college recruiters forum and her teammates that need bball scholarships to go to college weren't playing their best because they were so tired from not having a sub.  Then, then, then.  Dh and I got to brush off our parenting skills and it was not fun or easy.  Fortunately, her coach had some pre-wrap and tape in his bag and taped her ankle.  By the fourth game, she couldn't stand it and went in (despite my loudly expressed wishes to the contrary).  At first she was really limping, but by the end of the game, she didn't even look like there was a problem.  And she played well (if a step slower than normal).  Once I got back home and called dh and dd (remember, they went straight up to Poughkeepsie to look at Vassar College tomorrow), dd reported that she still has the tape on and the ankle is an ugly purple (she's nervous about removing the tape as she knows it will be worse under there). Glad the dh is in charge of the parenting skills now! So, Paula, I hope your ds' tournament was less medically eventful.  ;) You do that happy dance, Julie!!!  (And sign me up for the losing eyebrows group-darn!) Hope you got some sleep... Carol-Priscilla Presley can't smile-her face will fall off! KathyL-my arm hair stayed on, too.  Isn't that weird how the drugs are affecting all of us in such similar ways?  Nails are still there, but I need to shorten them again.  I'm hoping that by keeping them short they won't catch on something and bend back, because if they do, they're history.  Exciting news about your new nipple!  You'll have to let us know exactly when you're having it done so we can send you our best nipple thoughts. Wow, SIS Kimberly, that infection is really being stubborn.  I'll keep my fingers crossed that it doesn't get in the way of your last reservation in the lounge.  At least your attitude about it all sounds good.  Oh man, I gotta get on my cards or you guys won't let me play... Therese-you've really been hit hard by the strep in your house.  Hope everyone gets well soon.  When we were in the hotel this weekend, I noticed there was one of those magnifier mirrors, so I took a look at my eyebrows.  Just as you reported about yours, I can see new ones are coming in, but the old ones are falling out faster than they can grow.  I don't know where/how to draw in replacements, either, so I'm hoping I won't look too weird (okay, too much weirder than I normally do). HOORAY about the BRCA results!!! You're welcome, Joan.  I wish we had everyone's birthday on the header.  (Note to those w/o the birthday notation-get your dates in to either KathyL or me.  We want to think about each of you on your day!) So I'm complaining about my dd's sprain and read on about the infected raspberry in the groin.  Ouch!!!  Hope the ds is getting better, Carol.  You need those massages!  I get MLD (forget what all the letters stand for) for my le.  It's kinda like massage, but not much pressure.  It's more massage for the lymph.  I always drool a little when I get them, but I try to hide that from my legu-don't want to freak her out. LW Dana-Yes, my dear, you have been blessed.  And chemo is doing its best to bless you with its many joys.  Is it time to look into some extensions for some of your schoolwork?  Or some accommodations?  Can't hurt to ask.  Hang in there.  Oh, and my mantra about negative/distracting people?  F*ck \u2018em if they can't take a joke. Paula-I hear you on the long hours in the snack bar-been there many a time, myself.  Congrats to the ds (and his exemplary mother) on induction into the National Technical Honor Society.  Those awards are not easy to earn.  And a good game!  Sounds like a good week at your house! Oh, and KathyL doesn't need to worry about missing any THOs (titty hard-ons), rads seem to have created a permanent THO for Frankenboob and it hurts! Okay, I'm caught up to my Sat. morning post.  I gotta get to bed or I won't make it tomorrow at all.  More to come!  (You guys are probably all rolling your eyes over that one!) D1",

      "Content": "May 4, 2008 03:51PM Determined1 wrote: So it's Sunday.  Hope you guys all have the same great weather we have here (what am I doing inside????). Weekend was good.  Dd played well again this weekend.  They have AAU National qualifiers starting next weekend, so the coach was having her work on her 3 pt. shot.  I'm sure it was pissing off the other players (and their parents) to watch my kid jack it up all the time, but I'll admit that I'm happy that it's finally her turn.  She used to hit about 35% of her 3's, but with the confidence beating she took during this past varsity season, her shooting isn't as accurate (there was one point a couple of years ago she was shooting 80% from the floor and she finally got a coach that said that wasn't acceptable.  If she was hitting that many shots, that meant she wasn't shooting enough.  Glad she got over that and starting shooting more!).  She scores about half the points for this particular AAU team every game, so the coach will need her to really be on her offense next weekend.  This is great for her.  I just hope that when she goes back to varsity next year the coach gives her a fair chance to prove herself. Frankenboob is just miserable.  Since about Thursday, I really haven't wanted to wear anything but a soft t-shirt.  And sleeping last night was fitful as every position seemed to aggravate the burn.  But I'm trying to wear my compression garment as much as I can (oohhh, on that blistery nipple, its NOOOOOO fun).  I keep telling myself if I can make it to 5p I can take off the garment and have a cocktail.  So far, it's working for me.  I'm hopeful that since I only have boosts left, my boobie will start to heal and things will be better. I had an emotional experience at my tanning session yesty.  While I was waiting my turn a husband and wife came in.  The wife was in a wheelchair and looked really drawn and tired.  I started chatting with them and learned that the wife has colon cancer and so far she's had a surgery and 2 weeks of rads.  She was really sad and was feeling sorry for herself.  She was also very scared because she was going to stop rads and start chemo on Monday.  (Sounded like a strange tx to me, but what do I know?)  Anyway, I started to share some coping strategies with her and then it was my turn.  So I went in, got my zap, fist pounded my techs, gave them donuts, and went out.  The lady was in the hallway as she was going in next.  When I got back to the waiting area, I sat with her husband.  He started telling me that they were crying all the time because it just wasn't fair that she had cancer.  Oh man, I got on our soapbox.  I started coaching him on ways to be supportive.  I told him how important attitude was.  Yada, yada, yada.  When the wife came back, he asked me to share with her, too.  So I did.  Plus I gave her ideas on how to combat different se's.  I managed to get a couple of laughs out of them.  Finally, off they went and I repaired to the changing room to put my clothes on.  I could hear that they were talking to one of the techs on their way out and couldn't tell what they were saying, but I heard the tech reply, \"Yeah, isn't she amazing?  She has the best attitude of all of our patients!\"  Let me tell you, my day was TOTALLY made! Okay, enough about me (it's like watching my kid jack 3's up, isn't it?), let's get to the rest of my wonderful friends here. Sheshe, I completely forgot about Mederma for scar reduction (good call, Carol).  I've heard about it, too.  I'm too lazy to check, but if you Google it, I think you can get a coupon for it online. Good luck at work tomorrow, KathyL.  I hope you're not too tired to let us know how it went. Tinalee, you be studly in my book, going for the local during port removal.  I have to be knocked out for them to do ANYTHING to me!  I hope your weather cooperated today and you were able to get some planting done.  I haven't even started thinking about mine. Hey Diana, long time no post!!!  Good to hear from you.  (And with good advice, no less.)  Glad you're cranking through the Taxols (and soon you'll be able to wear flip flops outside, too!). WOW, Julie, you could start recon this week??!!  That would be awesome.  I know you'll have all of your requests done in plenty of time (you always seem so organized), so try not to stress.  You'll have to let us know if the schedule works out for you for this week. Loved the 5th Dimension, SIS Kimberly.  What a different time that was!  I'm so impressed with your chicken dinner.  I've never been able to make stuff up in the kitchen.  I don't have the confidence, I guess.  Sounds like you're past that cough, eh Joan?  Good timing.  Please be sure you get some exercise (even a walk) regularly throughout rads.  I'm really convinced it's helping with my energy level (which is much lower than when I started, but I'm still getting stuff done).  And continue to hydrate-it should help your skin. I was smiling at your can of worms at the spa, Carol.  My girls will try anything to keep acne under control (and they're under the care of a dermatologist!).  Luckily, college girl seems to be past the worst of it, but my younger one has the most unfortunate \"back-ne\".  Most of the time, it's unnoticeable, but when she has her bball uniform on, you can see it all over her shoulders.  Poor baby. Also glad that your tummy is holding up this time.  Whatever you're doing-stick with it. Can totally relate to the chemo-induced brain fart.  I frustrate my family with them all the time!  Hope you got some help and sent your tax check in before they come and cart you away. Shoot Paula, you deserve to be tired-you did the Komen walk!  I tried to access the link for the video, but I can't get it to work, poopy.  I hope your ds had a great time at the prom.  Its so much fun to see them all dressed up, isn't it?  I got tears in my eyes when college girl went last year (for a non-crier, I'm a huge sap). What a great day you had with your dd, KathyL.  I just love days like that.  I hope we get to Rehoboth again, too.  I'd LOVE to meet you in person. CathyCA!!  So glad to hear from you!  And even happier that your dad is doing well.  I hope he continues to recover.  Your trip sounds great and what a thrill to get autographed drumsticks!  So cool!!!  Good luck on Tuesday-FUBC!!! SIS Kimberly-I can sure understand your excitement/dread feelings.  I started to get them around the edges before I locked my rads schedule down, then once I had my next plan in place, the feelings went away.  Guess they'll return next Saturday morning... PALady-I'm happy to send Deanna's book along to you.  Please pm me with your mailing address.  No, I wouldn't ask about the number of zaps, either.  I had node involvement, so that's probably why I got a few more.  But I only have 5 left, so I'm going to be positive.  Keep putting the goop on your boob so it heals up quickly. Well, huge sigh.  I'm getting mentally prepared to tackle my last 5 days of rads this week.  After that, I'll have no tx plans in place (I see my onc on May 21, so I'm sure we'll be changing that).  Time for those anticipation/dread feelings Kimberly described.  We shall see. Dh has made reservations on Friday night for us to celebrate my achievement, as well as college girl finishing her Freshman year (she comes home for the summer on Thursday), and dd making it through AP testing.  We're headed to Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I'm not much of one for red meat (except hamburger, which shouldn't count), but I'm looking forward to a well-prepared steak.  I'm sure it will take me a week to digest it! Onward through the fog!!!  (Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't use that expression anymore-fog has such negative connotations, now.) D1",

Carol-I actually had the same thought as Paula on the grades/driver's license thing.  Marshall your thoughts and suggest to the ex-h (is that right?) that grades have been good last marking period and the current one (make sure ds keeps those grades up for the last marking period) and that you both factor in the turmoil of bc into the requirement.  I'm sure a 3.0 was a reasonable goal before dx, but sometimes we have to revisit our goals when we get a curveball.  Perhaps changing this goal will soften the disappointment of not getting the tattoo right now.  But think your arguments thru to yourself, or hash them out with dh BEFORE you call your ex so you can avoid getting emotional and lose your thoughts.  Ds is depending on you. PMS without MS?  Don't you have an appointment in the lounge today?  Aren't you now dealing with the ds' disappointment?  Isn't Steph in a bad way?  Wasn't dh out of town?  Hmmmm.  Sounds like the ingredients to a meltdown to me.  I'm sorry you went there, but it's completely understandable.  Take care of yourself, my friend.  I know you're strong. SIS Kimberly--$20/month sounds reasonable to me.  That way, we can go over some months or under other months and even it out.  I like that you're getting out again.  Just keep listening to your body.  I was SOOOOO impatient with my body when I finished chemo.  I gave myself 10 days after my last infusion to get through se's and after that I had no patience for any of it.  It made me frustrated and angry at times.  In all honesty, it was about a month after my last infusion before I felt my energy was back (course, then I started rads...).  Give yourself time. Keep those migraines away, Miss Julie!!!!  And it sounds like its time to celebrate your certification.  Good for you.  My head is not hurting, but my hair isn't really growing much.  I'm disappointed in that.  Dh is trying to be supportive by noticing new hairs, but you can still see my scalp.  Poopy. KathyL-I'm imagining you running in to your test (yikes!) all flushed and breathless, too!  Glad you have some time today to regroup a little. Paula-It's hard to watch those games that fall apart, isn't it?  I always try to take solace in my kids' effort and if it was good, focus on that, not the final outcome.  Sounds like ds put out a good effort and deserves to be proud of his performance, even though they didn't win.  Besides, in this weather, who cares what the final score is! Okay, gotta go shower.  I'm taking my doggy to a party this morning before I go for my tanning session.  The neighbor dog is celebrating his adoption day today with Frosty Paws for his \"friends.\"  (This sounds so incredibly yuppy to me, but I'm sure Kippy will be happy with the treat!)

Sheshe-Yeah, the chemo brain seems to linger.  I still find myself talking along and then all of a sudden, poof, I completely forget my point or even that I was talking in the first place.  Strange.  My family claims I was like this before chemo, but I don't believe them.  This feels so out-of-body.  Keep the boob lotioned and hydrate during rads.  Also, exercise (I know, you guys are getting tired of me, but this is important.  I think we focus on chemo so much and overlook the fact that rads have se's, too.). Not sure if jello helps hair growth, Julie, but I know its supposed to be good for fingernails, so I'm extrapolating.  I'll do anything!  ;) SIS Kimberly-The walk sounds great.  I'm going to look into the Komen walk here.  I think its on June 7, which isn't a great day for us.  Dd has SAT Subject tests that morning and then we have to hop in the car for a 4 hour drive to Virginia Beach for a bball tournament (she'll miss the morning games, but we can't do anything about that).  I hope I can work it out, the community togetherness sounds wonderful. I didn't know there was a StoryCore book, either.  I look forward to the broadcasts every week.  Some of them bring a tear to the eye. OMG, big LOL at the skating extravaganza at halftime of the skate meet!  Can you see the moms on skates????? Yep, yep, lube the boob.  Love it, Paula!  My boost area is a big \u2018ol angry red 3\" circle today.  I thought the boosts wouldn't burn as much, but I guess I was wrong.  My girl is still in a bad way.  You can tell that some of the \"tougher\" areas from the original field are starting to heal up, but I think this will certainly take the full month of recovery babydoc told me it would. You brought tears to my eyes, Kathy, with the description of the tribute.  The butterflies must've been awesome.  They are such beautiful creatures, anyway, and to know that they were so loved by your friend's mother, well, you all know what I'm trying to say.  I'm sure she was as moved by the tribute as those on Earth. Thanks, as always, for keeping up on the lounge list.  It makes me so happy to see how short it's getting! Off to watch the dd shoot some hoops again.  Only one game today.  I hope she plays as well as she did yesty afternoon.  That would be the best Mother's Day gift!  (Since I already vacuumed and cleaned the stove myself today!  Can you send your dh my way, KathyL?) Till tomorrow (when I do NOT have rads!), D1",

LOL at you up to your hoot in rads come July!  The image... So glad you heard from your son, Peg.  I hope that means he's getting things worked out. Eating out is good!  Glad your birthday was a real celebration, Joan.  How'd the visit with your radonc go today? What a thoughtful gift, Sheshe.  Sounds like your mother's day was filled with love for mom-you and your own mother. Sometimes my tanning salon appeared deserted, too.  I found out that some patients have to take a break in their sessions because their skin gets so burned.  Apparently, a break now and then is okay.  I didn't even have a Monday holiday during my sessions, so the only breaks I got were the weekends.  But I held up okay.  Today the larger field is looking much better-just itches now.  The boost field is red, red, red and some of the blisters on my nipple have reappeared (part of my nipple was in the boost field).  I'm hoping that by keeping it lubed up it'll heal soon. Goodness, Paula, with all the fundraising you're doing, you NEED a massage!  You never cease to amaze me. SIS Kimberly-I wish I lived in your neighborhood.  I'd pretty much be a stalker by your place waiting for the \"café open\" sign to come out! Well, dd didn't play as well on Sunday as she did in the second game on Saturday, but she wasn't HORRIBLE.  I think she had something like 11 points-which was a third of her team's total score.  They lost by one point.  That puts them in 3rd place in her age group.  No one seems to have a handle on whether that was pool play, or since there were so few teams in her age group, the medal round.  I hope her coach figures it out.  He seems to think the medal round is next weekend, so they qualify to continue, if that is the case.  You're right, though, Kimberly, I think she does feel the stress now.  She has 2 more AP tests this week, then they have 2 weeks of SOL testing (Standards of Learning tests-in Virginia kids need to pass a certain number of them during their schooling years to be promoted/graduate).  After that, finals start.  She's out of school June 18-seems like a long time.  Right now, she's upstairs playing her guitar, which seems to relax her and then she has plans to hit the gym.  At least she's trying to manage her stress. No, no one got the Mother's Day memo in my house.  Actually, the rule around here is that if you feel strongly that something should be done, then do it yourself.  Since I'm the only one that seems to notice dirty floors or dirty stoves, I clean them.  And dh's parents were coming over for dinner yesty, so I really wanted that stuff cleaned up.  Price I pay for my anal retentiveness. Oh, LOL on the ADD!  My dh has it, too!  His is called his BlackBerry... LJ13, I'm going to cross my fingers that you fall in the 20% of folks whose tumors are felled by chemo alone.  SOMEONE's gotta be in that 20%--why not you?  Great photo, btw.  Softball is only fun, IMO, when the weather is glorious.  Hope you guys had a glorious day! Well, back to my task at hand.  My mom just loves Willie Nelson and he's not holding any concerts while we're in Austin over Memorial Day.  So I'm trying to find a suitable photo of him that I'll cut out, mount on cardboard (cut exactly like the photo), and glued to a paint stirrer so we can hold his head up when we go out.  I'm also going to get some brown and gray yarn to make braids to glue to it and cover the glue spots up with a bandanna I'll tie on the \"head.\"  We're weird, but we'll be hooting all over Austin when we take Willie out with us! No med appointments today!!!!  What a relief!!! D1",

I'm trying to catch up on all the things I've let slide for the past 6 months and it's taking time away from here.  Not good.  But, I'm trying to get things organized to paint my kitchen/family room and I need to order new curtains for same.  The only problem with that is everyone in my house seems to have an opinion and it takes forever to compromise! Also, today I finally kept my hair appointment.  It felt SO good to be there.  (I never thought of myself as a \"girl,\" but I guess I am!)  My stylist put a wash out color in my hair (a golden brown), to cover the gray (most of it) and trimmed the long hairs and gave me some \"shape\" so when more hair grows in, I don't have a circle of hair around my head.  Even though it doesn't look dramatically different, it is noticeable.  Even dh noticed without prompting.  And she only charged me $20!  My next appointment is in 5 weeks, so you know there wasn't much there today... I also stopped by the nursery to buy plants for the front yard beds.  I've felt so behind hearing how all of you are planting and you're in more northern climes than I!  I had to get on the stick.  Perhaps it will be nice enough on Sunday to plant them (we're getting a lot of rain). Let's see what I can do about shouts-try not to judge me. Glad to hear tatts weren't a big deal for CathyCA.  I have four tattoo \"moles\" myself.   I hope both of our nails hang in there. SIS Kimberly-you sound like you're being fair to the whole rads issue.  You need to do what makes you comfortable in the long run.  Hear everyone out, mix in your research and make a decision with which you can be at peace.  That's what its all about. Joan-You really should try to get some exercise while doing the rads.  You'll find you're lower on energy and the exercise will help to balance that out.  Give that gym membership a try.  I'm also happy to read you're keeping the boob lubed.  So important.  The only peeling I've had so far is on the nipple (it looks like a bad case of that skin disease Michael Jackson claims to have) and that's to be expected since it was so covered with blisters. Paula-Maybe it was a week ago you soaked in the tub and slept some, but I was happy to see you allowed yourself the time.  You burn your candle at 4 or 5 ends, so reading that you were soaking was a good thing. SIS Kimberly-Thanks for checking in on CarolC.  I hope the job offer leads to more comfortable times for her. KathyL-I'm with Carol on the whole SP thing.  It's not supposed to be a stressor.  In fact, if you wait a little, it'll be more of a surprise, dontcha think? PALady-Ooooh, a girls' weekend!!  Sounds good.  The Deanna Farve book should be waiting for you when you get back home.  Enjoy your time away. KathyL-my college girl thinks I should have my 4 rad tatts connected into something cool over Frankenboob (probably tattooed stitches to go with the theme!).  With my needle phobia, I don't think that's in the cards... Hey Carla, your strength is inspirational.  Hope the Red Devil was an angel to you. SIS Kimberly-been watching the weather and it looks pretty hot out your way.  Maybe I'll stop by for my glass of vino when the weather's better...  LJ13-your surgery news sounds good.  I'll keep fingers crossed for clean margins and no node involvement. Hey Therese, you've had a bit going on, haven't you?  But you still sound upbeat, which as we all know, is the larger part of the battle.  I'll bet you're getting through the toughest part now and you'll be fluffing those girls soon. Carol-I've been thinking about what Debra's doc said to her since you called today (sorry I couldn't talk much, the guy adjusting my glasses was a total loser).  You have to remember that we are all unique and that our doctors are a product of what they've done \"lately.\"  They will tell us what they think will justify whatever their treatment du jour is.  (Sorry, ended that sentence in a preposition.)  Anyway, I suspect Debra is being discouraged from CMF for reasons other than \"it's not available in the US.\"  That's just a convenient excuse not to explore it.  So don't doubt your own tx.  As for what is best for her?  Well, part of that is up to her.  I know I was given cocktail options and chose what I thought was best (read that to say, what appeared to be the fewest se's-as if that's an option!).  She is wise to seek out people who have done the tx's and factor that in to her decision.  After all, these decisions are SO personal (witness SIS Kimberly's process with the whole rads thing).  See what happens when we lay people start learning about medicine???  We start questioning the so-called experts!  (Good thing, it keeps them on their toes.) Anyway, my family is off to bed and I don't feel a need to burn the midnight oil. Tomorrow is a big day.  Dd's basketball team has qualified for the medal round and if they win their 11am game tomorrow (which will put them in the championship game) they qualify for Division II Nationals.  It's funny, since this kid has been to Division I Nationals (with another team) and finished in the top 10 in the nation three years in a row, she's not motivated to try to make it to D2.  Dh and I are trying to keep her head in the game as no one else on her team (or her coach) have ever been to Nationals-D2, let alone D1.  We'll see how it goes (particularly since her coach keeps telling her she's the team's offense-what a change from her varsity team!).  Should be interesting. Nitey nite, ladies. D1 Thinking about Julie.",

Carol-sounds like the ds is really working hard!  So glad his dad changed his mind about the license.  When they start to work, it's really a hassle to pick them up all the time.  We're struggling around here now with 3 cars and 4 drivers.  I never dreamed it would be this complicated.  College girl wants to take a car to college her soph year as she's taking photo next semester (she took 4 years of high school photo and has even had a show of her work-she's actually pretty good), and needs to be able to get around to  get her shots.  I guess we'll have to figure that one out.  If we're going to get another car, I'd rather do it sooner than later as we may as well enjoy the benefit of the extra set of wheels now. Not sure what's going to happen on the Nationals front.  Dd is coming to the conclusion that she'd like to go, even though her team will be eliminated pretty early.  I'm not sure-it is a lot of money.  More to come, I'm sure. Glad you got with Kalen and Deb.  Please let Deb know I'm happy to talk to her if she thinks it would be helpful. Sheshe-Yikes!  A gall bladder attack.  That doesn't sound like much fun.  I'm glad you were able to enjoy your family, though.  Those visits are good for the soul. You might want to see if your rad onc can give you a script to get a consult with a lymphedema specialist before you finish rads.  Rads makes lymphedema worse, so any massage therapy you can get during rads will help keep the lymph fluid draining.  Besides, the massages are great (the burned boob business wasn't so fab, but I did my best to ignore it). SIS Kimberly-the party sounds like fun.  I'll bet the shot was good for you-I agree with your dean! Not much going on here today.  I've played with the computer some and need to do some more research in prep for my onc visit on Wednesday.  Later the girls have a dental appointment, so that'll take 2 hours or so.  Oh, and if there's time/energy left, I need to bake some cookies for dd's school lunches.  At least I got to the gym this morning (get off your duff, SIS Kimberly-no time like the present!). Good luck in the lounge, tomorrow, Kris!  Go kick some cancer booty! Later, Ladies. D1",

I have more info to share from my onc appointment yesterday.  I was just so fried last night that I could barely remember what happened.  So, for those in chemopause, my onc said that we need to wait about 8 months after our last chemotini to determine whether or not our chemopause is menopause.  If there's still no sign of period after 8 months, I guess we can consider it permanent.  Not sure what you guys are hearing, but that's the news from Georgetown.  For what it's worth. Carol-I love your fans.  My hot flashes are getting more heated (not sure if that's a pun, or just a statement of truth), and they bug me.  Thank God I don't have much hair!  My heat dissipates quickly. SIS Kimberly-I did the Adjuvant! Online and if I do hormonal therapy, I gain 9% on my recurrence score and 3% for mortality.  That means my chances of being alive 8 years from now is 93.6% if I do HT.  That is still kinda scary low to me, so I'm all for adding the 3% to get to 93.6.  I know that sounds conservative of me (and I reserve the right to change my mind if I react poorly to HT), but you have to remember that I fell into the 5% of patients who develop le-I'm not quite feeling good about avoiding the 10% who will die in 8 years after all of the shit I've been through.  Since my experience with the odds pretty much sucks, I'll add the 3% and cross my fingers that it's enough. We talked about uterine cancer and the lack of tests to detect it.  He seems to think if I see my gyn every six months for a pelvic, we should stay on top of that.  (I already see my gyn every six months, so that's nothing new to me.  I've had a history of bad pap smears, so I'll just be having those like clockwork.) You see, I was all about taking risks before I decided to do chemo.  But since I've done that, WTF?  I may as well continue on the conservative path I've chosen and bring my recurrence/death numbers down as low as I can.  If I was going to skip out on something, I should have done it before chemo.  Like I said, I'll continue to read and study for the next couple of weeks and reserve the right to change my mind, but that's where I am tonite. Thanks so much for sharing your research.  I'm actually going to print it out and look over it again when I'm reviewing the information for the trials/studies I'm considering. Thanks for the update from Wendy.  I'll continue to send her my very best thoughts. Hey, Sheshe, glad you're finding some relief from your burns.  I really liked my rad techs, too.  I took baked goods in to them a few times and it really paid off for me.  They called me early when the machines were down and rescheduled me to keep me on the path to finish before Mother's Day (my personal goal).  I encourage you to take in something. Sheshe/SIS Kimberly, I encourage both of you to have a rinse out color added to your peach fuzz.  I had no to very little hair of color coming in and have been totally demoralized by that.  When I saw my hair dresser, she put in a rinse out color (so it wouldn't stain my exposed scalp) and trimmed some of the longer hairs by hand to make things more even.  The color has transformed my hair.  It's not really dark, but now you can see that hairs are coming in on me.  It's all a head game (hmmm, now there's a pun for you). I'm sleepy tonite.  Too much excitement from watching David Cook accept his just desserts last night, I guess.  Plus dh couldn't sleep last night (he went on travel today and I leave on Sat, so  we kinda miss each other for a week) and wanted to spoon.  We haven't been that intimate in years, so I woke up for it.  (I know, TMI, but it made my night!) I'm off to watch Grey's. Till tomorrow. D1",

Got my bag pretty much packed for my too early departure in the morning.  I'm really excited to spend some time with my mom and sisters away from our families.  I hope we get all good and caught up.  Willie's already grinnin' and I hope does some pickin' for us!  We should laugh a lot about him.  I won't be around till Tuesday, so keep the posting to a minimum, Jewels.  I don't need to get all overwhelmed when I get back!  Jk Carol-It was good to hear from you.  I've got my fingers crossed that the ds managed to pass the driver's test.  Those can be tricky, sometimes.  Thanks for the update on Jenn. Jenn-we're here for you.  If you need an ear, there are plenty around here.  Be well, fellow Jewel. Julie-you direct away, my drainless friend.  Take care of yourself and soon, you, too, will be doing stuff around the house that you'd rather not!  J  (oooh, yep, just read Tinalee's post.  She's right, you know.) Tinalee, sounds like the foobies are going to shape up real nice for you.  Hip hooray!  Don't run yourself ragged and score another temp-you don't need that right now.  The smokin' sounds fabo-I'm headed to one of my old favorite restaurants in Austin for some rib action myself! SIS Kimberly-thanks for the call.  Its fun to connect on the phone, too.  Actually, don't stop sharing your research with us.  I, for one, appreciate how it makes me think about what I'm doing here.  Not that I don't question everything, anyway, but knowing that others are questioning, too, gives me strength to persist.  I'm going to read about the studies my onc is recommending on the plane and hopefully, when I talk to the study coordinators next week, I'll have some good questions.  (And you gotta know I'll add some of the ideas I get from you into the mix, so thanks.) Have a wonderful time in AZ.  I agree with Tinalee that Sedona has its own energy, but I'll bet you notice it right away...  So I read about the 3 hour tour and immediately my head starts singing the Gilligan's Island theme and then you go on to mention the Minnow!  We are both totally sick. I hope KathyL gets some time off this weekend...it's time for a breather in that new schedule! Okay, ladies, I'm outta here till Tuesday.  Keep the thread hopping, but not so much I can't get back in the swing! Hook \u2018em horns! D1 Went to post and the site crashed-good thing I've learned to compose in Word!  But I see the news from Carol that the ds passed the test.  A BIG WOOOHOOO to him!!!!  He's right, it IS grown-uppy to have a job and a license.  I'm impressed on the deal with the insurance, that's a perfect way to give ds a little more incentive to get those grades up so he'll qualify for the good student discount.  You should all be hyped!  Enjoy that early arrival of the dh and start the weekend party!!!!!",

I had a great time with my mom and sisters.  I haven't laughed so hard in years!  I also drank like a fish and may need to go to detox to get rid of all the poison, but it was sure fun!  Highlights included some fabo food-tex-mex, bbq and Indian (yep, Indian).  A fun tour of the LBJ library where we borrowed a wheelchair for my mom because we decided that she was so sauced that she'd surely fall down if she walked the whole thing.  A swing past my old apartment (it should probably be demolished now, but it was nice when I lived there almost 30 years ago, I swear!).  And a walk thru the UT campus for me and my youngest sis who lived with me for one semester and attended UT with me (one of the highlights of the trip, IMO).  We also attended the Austin Wine Festival, where I tried to apply some of the facts I learned by reading the wine book my SP sent to me, but I think I tasted too many wines and overlooked the finer points... ;)  We played cards and drank some more and laughed (did I mention the drinking and laughing????).  We had a marvelous time. I also went topless for the weekend.  It was GREAT!  At dinner one night a young gal came over to our table and told me she hoped she wasn't being too personal, but had I recently done chemo?  I started chatting with her and it turned out that her 82 year old granny had finished chemo about a month ago and just had her lumpectomy the day before-and, get this, was with them for dinner!  Well, I popped right up and went over to give granny a hug.  She let me peek under her hat and I discovered that she had about 50 chin length hairs on her head.  She said she didn't want to shave them off because it was all she had left.  She was darling.  I told her how impressed I was that she was at the restaurant a day after surgery and she said she didn't think she was really all there, so not to be so impressed.  We didn't have time to do much more, but I really liked meeting her and wouldn't have had the chance if I hadn't been out in all of my balditude.  What a sisterhood we have! So, what have you all been doing while I was cirrhosising my liver? LWDana-My onc said the same thing about the ovaries.  Apparently, removing them will temporarily halt the production of estrogen in our bodies, but eventually our systems will find another way to manufacture it and we'll still need to use some type of drug to block it from feeding cancerous cells.  I'm going to bug my onc for more info on Tamoxifen as I'm not very excited about the se's, either.  I'll report here anything I learn.  Please do the same. Paula-So, so sorry to hear about dh's seizure.  I'm hoping as I read on, you'll have more to share about his situation.  All my thoughts are on you and your family right now... CHJ-Congrats on the move.  You're one tough gal to be able to do that so soon after chemo.  Hats off to you.  Good luck starting rads tomorrow.  It's really a breeze compared to what you've done so far. Julie-Hooray on the drain removal!  And you're coping with Motrin?  Good for you.  Hope you were able to make it in to school today for the half day, I know that always makes you feel better. Omigosh, Sherry!!  Happy belated birthday!!!!  I know what you mean about missing your rads team-mine was great, too.  What a good birthday present they gave you!  A real send off.  It sounds like you're moving at a quick pace on this wedding.  Wish I could've helped with the cake tasting... Oh, I just got to your pix, but they don't show up on my screen.  It says Photobucket moved or deleted them.  Darn it.  (Just read that Carol is having the same experience, poopy doo.)  I do like the avatar!  FUBC!! Yoga sounds great, I hope you do it. Jenn-Don't worry about getting your thoughts down.  We're all thinking about you and pulling you through.  Just try to pop in and let us know how things are going and if there's anything we can do to help you.  If you recall, we become sapphires when we're feeling a little blue, so stick with us, Jewel, we're here for you. Way to go, Carol, on the walking!  I know you'll fall off the pace a little come tomorrow, but I'll bet you'll bounce back a lot faster since you're getting the rest of your body conditioned.   Hey, and way to go to the ex on coming up with some wheels for the ds.  It's wonderful when they can get themselves to and from work, isn't it? JKiss!!!  Another \"long time/no post\" Jewel!  Thanks for letting us know everything's okay with you.  I can totally understand not wanting to talk bc so much.  It sounds like you're moving on.  That's a good thing.  Stop by once in a while and let us know how those 3 month checkups are going. Hope you got all those flowers to the cemetery before the rain set in, Tinalee.  That's such a nice thing to do.  I love driving by cemeteries when they're dressed for Memorial Day.  Fast forward:  Just read about your Memorial Day.  It sounded wonderful.  I really liked that you guys are reconnecting with your neighbors.  Not sure you'll like my sense of humor, but some funny movies I can think of:  Borat, the Wedding Crashers, Roxanne, hmmm, if I think of more, I'll send them along. KathyL-the school party sounded like so much fun!  I almost got tears in my eyes imagining how happy it made you to see your kids having a blissful day.  I'm happy for you.  And the thank-you party was such a nice gesture.  I honestly don't know how you do it-like SIS Kimberly would say, a SHERO for sure!  My dh and daughters were in your neck of the woods this past weekend, at Rehoboth Beach.  They said it was the best weather we'd ever had at Rehoboth.  I'm so sorry I missed it on many counts.  Next time... PALady-sounds like you had a good time away for your cation.  They are so good for the soul, aren't they?  Glad you got the book, it's a pretty quick read.  I think it will be normal for us to start to get back to our \"lives\" as we finish tx.  My guess is that our daily posts will be shorter and shorter as time goes on.  And that's a good thing.  I do believe that we have shared something that no one but us will ever understand, so it will be nice to check in with each other from time to time.  I hope we'll be able to keep that up for many cancer-free years to come. So, here's hoping Kris60 passed the halfway point today without a hitch.  And good thoughts to Wendy and Carol tomorrow (Carol, you know we're all still \"with\" ya.  And before you know it, you'll be done.  Chin up, girlfriend.). Glad to be home.  I'll be looking forward to my next cation!!!! D1 Oh, oh, almost forgot!  I'll be lighting the candle my SP sent to me tonight.  I'm looking forward to some relax time with it and my book.  Thanks!!!!!!!",

      "Content": "Jun 6, 2008 06:34AM Determined1 wrote: Hmmm.  After reading the new posts, I'm a little overwhelmed here.  I'm just amazed at how supportive a bunch of total strangers can be to one another.  And to think just 6 months ago we didn't even know each other!  As always, I'm humbled by the Jewels. Enough sap (oh, I'm going to be SUCH a mess tomorrow in my pink t...).  So, yes, I'm doing the Komen Race for the Cure tomorrow in DC.  I've been trying to organize my family logistics for weeks now and even tho only dh and I are available, I'm excited.  A friend of mine (she was the one who ran my wheelchair into the wall and let me go down the ramp in the hospital, you may recall that story) and her dh are joining us.  Since we signed up late, only XL shirts are available, but I'll use mine as my gym rat shirt after tomorrow, and XL is what I like in the gym (not a spandex kinda gal-but you all probably knew that already).  I doubt we'll take a camera as the dh's model is really bulky, but I'll be smiling all the way! The painters are here to finish up this morning.  I'm really pleased with their work.  Last night I was able to put stuff back into our built-in bookcases and I was cleaning everything.  Washed anything I could wash and carefully dusted everything else (even used Q-tips!).  I got up this morning and cleaned the stove (I know, you've heard that routine before) and started washing the windows.  The painters arrived before I got through the windows, so there will be more to do after the Race tomorrow.  We're also going to go out and buy a new rug pad for our area rug (we have wood floors), since the old pad was deteriorating under our feet and we didn't realize it!  Once the painters leave I can start cleaning the floors well and I also want to clean the kick guard (is that what you call it?) under the kitchen cabinets (you know how they get all scuffed).  I must be totally sick to be this excited about cleaning my house... Unfortunately, college girl has invited her roommate for next year and another friend to spend the weekend with us.  I'm not wild about having houseguests when my house is in disarray, but everyone in my family keeps telling me to take a chill pill and not worry about it.  Grrrr. So, SIS Kimberly is getting her new boobs today.  I'm thinking about \u2018cha, girl.  And I'm with everyone else on the food thing.  If your surgery is later in the day, they should give you a later \"stop\" time with the food/drink.  I actually tried to negotiate that before my last lumpectomy/AND, but no luck.  Anyhoo, you're on my mind.  Get some good girls! Wow, CathyCA, you're covering a lot of territory in the old country!  Is this an organized tour, or are you and dh putting this together yourselves?  Part of the reason we didn't do Russia this summer was no one wanted to be on the train so long between St. Petersburg and Moscow.  We did a lot of training last summer and the girls needed a break.  There's so much world to see that I'm okay with that.  We did think about getting to Croatia a couple of years ago when we went to Italy, but the logistics were too much.  I think a cruise would be a great way to see both (we were traveling by car that year).  I think that's why everyone wanted to go to Croatia this year.  Like you, we're all about traveling in our house-don't have fancy cars or clothes, but we go on kickass vacations! Jenn, I'm so happy to have you regularly posting again.  Thanks for coming back and telling us what you're up to.  Funny you'd mention shampoo, I just started using it again myself about a week ago!  Like you, no conditioner, yet, but that will come.  I've also stopped slathering my scalp with face lotion as I found it was making my \"hair\" greasy.  Maybe I'll be \"normal\" sooner than I thought! Oh, keep lubing during rads.  I must've lotioned 6 times a day during tx and for at least the first 2 weeks afterward.  This past 2 weeks (weeks 3 and 4 after rads), I've cut it back to 4 slatherings a day.  My skin is in really good shape despite all the dire warnings I received beforehand.  I think my rad onc told me all that ugly stuff so I'd stay on top of my skin care.  I'm even still using the Dove soap and Tom's deodorant they recommended (although as soon as the Dove soap is gone, I'm going back to my old soap and deodorant). Oops, Carol, didn't mean to be insensitive with my poop talk.  We had chicken, black bean and corn enchiladas last night and they moved right through me-perhaps you should head out to a tex-mex joint???  (JK.  I'll bet the thought of it made your tummy churn-how mean can I be???)  Seriously, you doing better today?  Oh, and I think I did better with the painting than the 62\" TV-but just my opinion.  (62\"???  That's like a total home theater!  Make sure the ds stays away with the bb gun-we've seen what they can do!) Ah, KathyL, a girl day.  How wonderful for you.  I didn't think I was all about that kind of stuff, but I've really enjoyed girl things in my post-chemo world.  Who knew?  Oh, and is your \"down there\" hair growing like gangbusters?  Mine is.  Best hair on my body.  But it's coming in stick straight!  And it's black, black, black!  I don't remember it being that dark before.  Wish the pigment would travel to my head hair... Am I reading this correctly?  Is your Relay for Life today (Friday)?  If so, enjoy! Julie, Julie, Julie.  Be careful about that candle at both ends thing (perhaps I should pay attention, too).  It will be interesting to follow your ds's budding interest in a new sport.  You'll have to let us know what he decides to do. I LOVE your pix!!!  I think your hair is just how mine was at 7 weeks, but you couldn't see mine because it's all gray (it's hell to get old).  I'm starting to get some color now (particularly since I had the color added and have been using a shampoo that boosts a color job by adding a hint of color), and that really helps.  I'm going to have to figure out how to get a new picture taken and posted. Good luck with the fill today! Okay, my computer has been hiccupping and I'm afraid of losing this latest masterpiece (even tho it's in Word, my computer has already told me it needed to do a document recovery-whatever that means).  So I'll wrap it up. If I don't get a chance to pop in later, I'll give everyone the post \"Race\" report tomorrow. Onward!",

What are you guys doing? Julie-I noticed your post popped up at the same time as mine last night.  OMG you get banana rum punch at book club?  I think I need to join one!  The candle is grapefruit/berry.  Sounds like a weird combo, but it really smells fresh. Carol, my dog is a schnoodle (mini schnauzer/mini poodle combo).  I didn't think I'd get so attached, but I'm crazy about our dog.  I'm having all kinds of visions about the anesthesia and I'm sorry to say it keeps bringing tears to my eyes to think bad things could happen to her.  If anyone has good stories to share about anesthetizing their dog, please share (I don't want to hear ones that didn't turn out well.).  Yeah, I want a photo of you dressed for work with your fan on a string!  Maybe your summer camp assignment can be to make colorful lanyards to coordinate with your outfits... Great news about Steph-I hope he has a good visit with his mom and is recharged for his next round of chemo (can you imagine the strength of character he must possess?).  I'll keep thinking good things for him. Ewwww, SIS Kimberly, bug bites in bed?  Hope you don't have a case of bedbugs-they're a BITCH to get rid of. Have a great weekend, KathyL!!  And thanks for the calcium reminder.  It's funny you'd mention it as just yesty I was adding up the calcium I get from my vitamin/OJ/yogurt every day and learned I'm still coming up a little short.  Anyone have a calcium supplement they can recommend? You sound good, Paula.  Glad you got the trial started for Ed.  I remember how much anxiety eased once I got my tx underway-even if they did make me feel like shit at times.  I hope you guys are able to put all of this out of your minds and enjoy Dallas. I'm sure you're already using a plethora of pillows, SIS Kimberly, but they may help with the side sleeping thing till you heal up.  Have a great time in the Second City-it's one of my favorite towns. PALady, my dd gets her senior portrait done next week.  You may want to tell ds to rest easy as Chad Michael Murray on \"One Tree Hill\" is a major league squinter and, heck, he's a TV star! So, I'm driving to the gym this morning, and since it's only in the low 80's and I haven't showered, I'm driving along with the windows all down and the sunroof all the way open.  Unlike me, I tune in to the Oldies station instead of NPR because the road noise makes talk radio fruitless.  Suddenly I hear the trademark chord that starts Elton John's \"Bennie and the Jets.\"  The non-crier here almost lost it.  That was one of the songs I'd loved as a teen and hearing it took me right back to that summer in '74 when I got my license and first drove with the music up and the windows down.  It made me happy to realize that I made good choices in my cancer battle and now I'm here today to celebrate.  What a sap. Anyway, hope this Friday the 13th is lucky for all of you. D1",

KathyL--Yeah, we take the Centrum Women's, too.  It is a big pill.  But for some reason doesn't upset our tummies the way the One-A-Day Women's did.  Viactiv is a good idea.  I think we had that here when I was really pushing my dd's to take calcium.  It wouldn't hurt any of us to get on that bandwagon again.  And that's something we can take at dinner, to stagger the Centrum in the morning.  Ima go put it on the grocery list. Thanks to you and Joan for being encouraging about Kippy's dental appointment.  I wasn't focusing on the fact that she'd be groggy afterward (I was, what made me think my teeny dog would be different?), we'll have to drag her king-sized dog bed (I think it's for a St. Bernard, but she likes it in her corner of the bedroom) downstairs for easy access to the yard. Okay, I have to tell you all about my dreams.  For 3 nights in a row I've been dreaming that my period is starting.  How weird is that?  (Why can't I have those dreams about some faceless hottie pushing all of my buttons?????)  Anyway, I hope it's not a sign or something.  All I know is, I'm having hot flashes like crazy (having one right now, in fact).  I have to wash sheets every couple of days.  Not my favorite part of being a woman. It's late.  I think I'll retire for the night. Happy birthday to Deb tomorrow!  49 and holding, eh?  Good job!!!  (You doing okay?) D1",

I wish I could come and clean your stove for you, Tina, I'm pretty good at it.  I'm smiling when I listen to you describe the grad party-we'll be doing that next year.  Last year, college girl didn't want a party at home because I thought it would be fun and anything I wanted, she didn't want.  (Odd, just as soon as I was dx'd, I was suddenly a lot smarter and attractive to her...)  My little one can see that the party will bring in some booty, so I think she'll be more in to it.  In fact, she's cleaning up right now to head out to one.  (Lemon bars sound really good, if you're up for sharing the recipe, I'd love to have it.) LJ your leg pain sounds so familiar!  I'm just now noticing that my one lingering painful ankle is starting to feel a little better.  So that will mark the end of the constant aching.  Now all I'm dealing with is the stiffness/soreness I get when I'm in one position too long.  I'm hoping that will go away, too.  I love your hair reports.  I'm thinking exposure makes the hair grow, too, so that's how I'm selling my family on the whole topless thing.  I'm really leaving the top off more and more, but when I do anything at the school I have to have one and for some reason my family wants me to wear one at the neighborhood grocery store.  I think that's just in case I run in to any of the girls' pals.  Otherwise, I'm out there!  I think it will look better when I get it colored, but my appointment isn't for another 10 days or so (I wanted it close to the family reunion date so I look hot for the pics).  I can certainly be old and gray till then! Definitely use whatever lotion your rad team recommends.  I started pre-lubing my field a week before rads actually started.  My team didn't know if it would help or not, but it made me feel like I was being proactive and we all know the head game is the larger part of this battle.  My skin has weathered the whole thing really well and I'm quite fair.  I'm still lubing 2x a day right now-I figure I'll keep it up till the lotion runs out.  Oh, you should ask about deodorant, too.  I was told to use Tom's of Maine natural scent, which I found at Trader Joe's (I'm going to look into the fruit Viactiv, wish this had come up 24 hours ago as I was just in Trader Joe's yesty!). LOL on the sanitary napkin idea!  I actually used some pantiliners inside my bra after my 2nd lumpectomy as my scar kept opening to drain out fluid (should've had drains I think).  I was either stuck over the bathroom sink trying to squeeze fluid out or having to wear something incredibly absorbent or I couldn't go out.  I'm so glad those days are behind me... So far today we all went in to dh's office to use the gym there.  I know, a strange family outing.  It's even stranger when you realize that we all plug in to our iPods, so we don't even interact while we exercise!  But now I'm showered and ready to tackle whatever's next (perhaps some pimping?). Later. D1",

Yes, my friend, Carol, life is good!!!!  Congrats to you.  (Oh, college girl just brought me a beer, so I tilt my bottle in your honor.) \"She has electric boobs, her ma has too?\"  We never interpreted that second line quite like that.  Somehow the mohair suit made into our consciousness way back when!  (Although we didn't know what a mohair suit was either, Paula.)  And your bff had a Mustang Cobra?  Mine drove a Corvair.  And I drove a '65 Ford Fairlane.  Cost me $200, which was a pretty penny when you're earning 50 cents an hour babysitting!  Thank God I got the job at the donut shop-I was loaded after that!  ;) I hope your trip to Dallas goes well.  It sounds like you've got it all organized.  And the break from rads will give your field a chance to heal up some. Holy moly-those senior pic prices are steep!  My dd has her sitting tomorrow and the cheapest one is 6 poses for $25.  I'm going to spring for the next level-10-12 poses-for $40 because we learned with college girl that 6 poses is not enough.  I don't remember what the packages cost us, but we don't have an obligation to buy anything, so if they're awful, we'll start over.  A company called LifeTouch Prestige Portraits does our school and they come right to the school to take the pictures.  Guess I gotta get all the checks written and stuff filled out for that... And yeah, I think my hormones are outta whack.  I'm not sure what to do about it, but I will bring it up at my gyn exam next week. PALady-sounds like your weekend was all about soccer and fishing!  Total dad stuff, huh?  Congrats to your kids on their success on the soccer field.  Must've been a good experience for them.  Golden Doodles, they're the standard poodle/golden retriever mix, aren't they?  Quite a bit bigger than my 15 lb. baby. There's a tamoxifen metabolism test out there (I Googled it).  I printed out the info on it and took it in to discuss with my onc, but he doesn't put much stock in it.  He seems to think that Tamoxifen, which has been around for some 40 years, has a great track record and strongly recommended it to me.  I may switch to another drug in a couple of years, but he wants me to start here.  He told me I could do anything in moderation (I asked about drinking)-of course, I'm not sure whose definition of moderation we're using here...  He did not say anything about aspirin and I did not ask, since I don't take them.  My multiple vitamins are fine.  I am going to run all of this by my gyn when I see him, just because I want to have some confirmation. Oh no, LJ!  My heart just sank.  My cording was/is under my arm and restricts my range of motion.  My legu had/has me simulate the action of carrying a waiter's tray at shoulder level and rotate it back and forth, keeping my hand bent back at the wrist and flat, just like I'm carrying a tray on it.  Once I was able to do that easily, she had me raise my \"tray\" higher and higher and continue to swing it back and forth from my shoulder, keeping it flat so I don't dump anything off the \"tray.\"  Is this making sense to you?  Do it gradually, you don't want to exacerbate anything.  LE massage is pretty specialized and you'll want to be taught how to do it correctly in person.  I will say, any light rubbing you need to do to make the cording more comfortable should be done from the elbow toward the shoulder-not the other direction.  If you have lymph issues, you don't want to encourage anything to go down your arm.  And get thyself a script for a consultation with a lymphedema specialist pronto!  You want to make sure you don't have anything long term wrong going on there.  Please keep me posted. SIS Kimberly-Well, there's a sex drought at my house, too, but I won't go into the details here.  Just seems that if you REALLY want to, you don't NEED your arms.......  Hope that anniversary evening goes well! ;) And same advice to you-get a referral to a lymphedema therapist and have your arm checked out.  All you guys have to do is ask for it-if one doc won't give it, go to the next one.  Pretend you're teenagers and want to use the car-you keep asking a parent till one gives you what you want.  I'm not kidding.  Okay, off to see what's up for dinner.  I volunteered to cook tonight since dh is having his procedure done tomorrow (he's having something done to minimize his acne scars, which have bothered him his whole life.  I'm kinda sad to see them go as I think they give his face a wonderful character, but I'm not going to tell him that.  I'll just be supportive and know that if I want to get my boobs fixed up after all this turmoil that he'll have to let me!).  Anyway, I'm trying some new recipes.  First is Vietnamese beef sandwiches for which I've been marinating the flank steak.  Then I'll grill it and slice it up to be served in a baguette with shredded carrot, cilantro, scallions and a rice vinegar/ginger dressing.  Then I'm making roasted sweet potatoes and pears (sounded interesting).  My poor family.  Since I discovered cooking a couple of years ago I subject them to all kinds of new stuff.  I leave the fancy cooking to dh, as he's really an excellent cook, but I'm good with the grill! Toodles. D1",

Carol, so glad to read you \"slept in.\"  You are always on the go and sometimes we all need to do some resting for our mental health, if nothing else.  My galley time yielded some kickass sandwiches, if I may say so myself.  Dd even liked the roasted sweet potato/pear recipe.  Shall I admit that I got both out of a Martha Stewart cookbook???  I'm not a big MS fan, but dh got me her cookbook for Christmas (no one knew what to get a soon-to-be-chemo patient) as I've been expressing a new found interest in cooking over the past couple of years.  I've made a couple of things out of it and everything, to my surprise, has been good.  Maybe that time in the pokey did our Martha some good! Oh man, and now our newlywed is in the dreaded \"drought.\"  What is up in the universe????? Hey Carla, keep positive about your cyst.  I had a couple of scares myself during chemo (even had to have another needle biopsy-I sat in the car and cried afterwards...yep, the non-crier...).  It was all okay for me.  So keep the faith.  And yep, waiting sucks the most.  FUBC, girlfriend.  Let us know how it goes. LJ, Kathy's right, see a specialist.  You have no excuse now that you've come clean about the availability so close to you.   In fact, if you don't go, I may have to drive up to Ballmer and drag your almost-hairy head off to see a legu.  I'll repeat myself-I'm not kidding. SIS Kimberly, I can't believe you cooked Dover sole for dinner last night.  I'm watching the Food Network (well, not really) while I type this and they're cooking Dover sole!!!  Coinky dinky!  Just disappointed that the poaching juice didn't include any white wine... I really love the honesty dh showed you.  My dh still feels like it all has to be internalized and not shared.  Sometimes I'm not sure he realizes what our family has endured over the last year.  You and Greg are light years ahead and I applaud Greg's try to reach out to other caregivers.  Unfortunately, he did not find the January Jewel equivalent and is having to forge his own way.  Give him room (I know you will) and do your best to help him find his way.  (I really wish I were writing this to myself.) Drought is ended????  (Perhaps the tub wasn't too small after all!) Thank you for looking into seeing someone for the cording (LJ, are you still reading this??) A TURTLE!!??  OMG.  I'm LOL! Yay!!  A clean house! So today my dh had a thermage treatment to his face/neck.  He had to pop a couple of Vicodin to manage the pain and has talked non-stop about how cute the nurse was ever since.  Even college girl is laughing about it.  He keeps mentioning how nice her blond hair was.  I'm trying not to take it personally.  He's in a drug stupor.  Asshole.

A collage sounds like fun, Carol!  If you can do it electronically, I'd love a copy! SIS Kimberly-I read your first paragraph and smiled.  Thank goodness for your gyn.  And WTG on getting the script for the arm.  I won't remember when you're going in (I can't even keep up with my schedule), but I want to hear what they have to say, so please give a full report. Dh seems to be fully recovered from the thermage and the effects of the Vicodin (they also gave him some Ativan, so no wonder he was out of it).  He did mention the nurse again this morning, but told me he was most impressed with her tiny body, knowing that she was a 40-year-old mother of three.  I told him I didn't notice her body so much, but thought she had a smiling, kindly face that had had a lot of work done to it-didn't he see the wrinkles on her neck????  We laughed a little and I told him he didn't know how good he had it.  I may be 50 and have white/bald hair, but I'm holding up well, thank you, without any help from a plastic surgeon.  Hopefully, we won't be talking about her anymore.  Geesh.  As for the effects of the tx, he shouldn't expect to notice anything for 3-6 months.  Apparently, it takes that long for the collagen to wake up again.  By then, he'll have moved on to whatever procedures he's having done next (I think some retin-A and some kind of skin peel is in the cards-sounds awful to me). Oh, and thanks for the wishes for a sunshiney day.  It's absolutely beautiful here this morning and I credit you completely! Off to start my day. D1",

So a periodic check-in is good, because we'll start to worry about one another.  But don't feel obligated to do more than that.  I'm hopeful that someone will be around whenever a Jewel is in need, but no guilt.  We've dealt with quite enough, thank you. So my family is watching \"I Am Legend,\" and I've already found it too scary for me (despite the fact that Will Smith is incredibly easy on the eyes). On with my shouts. Oh man, CathyCA, I know exactly what you mean about the testing, etc.  I'm still dealing with a minimum of two med appointments a week with my le and I know more are coming to deal with my rotator cuff.  (I saw the rotator specialist today, who took many measurements and made my body burst into instant sweat more than once.  She says I have issues on both shoulders and that she'll work me over, but good.  She's going to fuck me up short term, but I have faith in her.  Cancer has given me so many gifts...)  Hey, for good measure, I see the eye doc tomorrow to see if my changing vision (you guys may remember that my vision got worse with each chemo tx) is going back to normal.  Where is Hank Moody when you need him?  Life is good.  (Vettegal will get that if she's lurking.) PALady-My legu says massages are okay as long as the masseuse doesn't get near your le quadrant.  That's the part of your body affected by the le.  You can still have your legs, lower back, and other arm massaged.  Be sure you tell your masseuse you're a bc survivor and may have le issues.   Any masseuse worthy of the name will understand and help you through the massage (I've also heard of some masseuses-or is that masseusi?-refusing to work on a bc survivor).  I got a certificate to a spa for a massage from my dh for valentine's day and plan to use it on aromatherapy or facials, just in case. My onc wasn't interested in baseline hormone levels, either.  I see my gyn next week and plan to ask him about it (even though I'll have taken Tamox  for 3 weeks by the time I see him).  I don't know if we need them, but it would make me feel better. And I agree with you-Taxotere fucked us up.  I'm still having trouble with one ankle and when I move from sitting to standing it takes a minute before my body adjusts.  I've never had these issues before, I can assure you. Well, SIS Kimberly, I'm glad you were laughing over my dh's infidelities with his thoughts!  Sorry the drought isn't over, but the bath and beddy bye sounds good to me.  Sometimes the 6'5\" dh and me at 5'9\" are just too big for the enjoyment of the dual bath.  I'm with Kimberly, Kris, we're all cheering for you!!  Hang in there. Your doc's dad sounds like Marcus Welby, SIS Kimberly.  You're lucky to have such a relationship with a caregiver.  I'm not really sure what the collagen stim will do for my dh.  I think it's supposed to tighten his wattle, or something.  He also had jowls zapped (you guys have to understand, I don't see any of this).  I completely understand that he wants to eliminate his acne scars, even though I think they make him handsome-we all have \"flaws\" that have haunted us for years and the acne predates me.  But I don't think until he gets to the peels that he'll see any change there.  I'm watching with interest and have laid down my marker that if I want to have a boob tidying up, that I'm allowed, since he's doing whatever this is. Ahhhh, Wicked!!!!  I'd LOVE to see that!  (And oh, yeah, the wicked witch has NOTHING on my cackle!)  Enjoy, enjoy!  We'll be here when you get back. So CathyCA, what is estrogen cream going to do for you, if you don't mind my asking?  I need a libido cream, I think. Carol, I think you must live in heaven... Jenn, I think the chemo will take a while to get out of our bodies-despite what our oncs, may say.  Give your knees some time.  I mean I had my last chemo tx at the end of Feb and am still dealing with stiffness/soreness issues.  Some of that may be age-related (meaning the older we are, the longer it takes to go away), but I don't know for sure.  Just keep shooting the squirt gun from the deck chair!  (And aren't strawberries supposed to be good for the libido???  Maybe that's why so many of us are snarfing them down!) KathyL-I thought we had kids so they would weed the beds without having to be paid??!!  Actually, college girl and dd have ended up doing the job together.  College girl told me today that she hates weeding and doesn't understand why I like doing it so much.  I told her I don't like to do it, but that it has to be done.  She said she'll hire it out when she has a house.  I hope she stays in college or hits the lottery! Tina-Fingers are crossed for good weather for your open house!  What an exciting time for your family!  Dd went off with college girl today to look for a homecoming dress for next fall, since college girl is gifted in the fashion department, and they came home saying they'd put a prom dress (that's a year from now!) on hold!  Gotta love girls. I'm tired.  I think I'll go to bed and try the pillow arrangement the rotator specialist recommended today.  I'm hoping it will help me sleep more comfortably (or sleep at all!) Nitey nite.",

My day was mighty expensive.  Eye doc (new contacts for dd and a new rx for moi).  Then to the mall to see \"the dress.\"  Yep, it's perfect.  We bought it.  Good news is that as long as we have the receipt and the tags on the dress, we can return it ANYTIME.  This is good as the dress is for the senior prom-NEXT JUNE!!!!!  Then to BB&B with college girl who knows how to run up a tab.  All good stuff, though.  She got a bound section of carpeting for her room, some storage items and some risers to raise her bed a few inches so she can store stuff underneath it.  We also found a cotton blanket for $15 because it's an irregular.   We couldn't find the flaw, so we snarfed it up.  Then to LensCrafters to fill my new rx (eye doc said no contacts, yet, he doesn't think my eyes are completely settled and wants to see how the Tamox will affect them).  I decided to get rx sunglasses, since I won't be able to wear my regular sunglasses on cation.  Then I wanted to use the same frames for my specs, just get new lenses.  Well, the type of frame I have cannot be reused.  I'm not happy.  I just bought the sunglasses and I'm going to see how different the rx is and if it's not much, I'll just gut out these regular glasses for 6 more weeks.  Grrrr. So, what have you all been doing today? I'm not on Arimidex, Maz, they're starting me with Tamoxifen and then I'll switch to Arim somewhere down the line.  Please start lubing your rad area about a week before you start and be diligent about it.  Hydration is also a must.  Otherwise, the bone density scan sounds prudent to me.  You go girl! Tinalee-Yep, sounds like cording to me.  It does NOT necessarily mean le, so don't panic, but do get to a le specialist and have it checked out.  You DO NOT want to find out you have le when your arm is all swollen and gross, okay (you reading this LJ?).  Gentle stretching will help with ROM, but be gentle.  I was told cording either gradually resolves or one day you'll feel a snap and suddenly realize that it's gone (I believe this was KathyL's experience).  My cording appeared in Feb and I still have it, but it seems to be diminishing in its noticability (does that make sense?).  Cording is funny stuff.  It's actually a string of your old lymph nodes that have been placed out of service because the lymph receptacle (the node) has been removed.  Whether they snap, or just fade away, your body will reabsorb them.  But I cannot stress the importance of being evaluated by a le specialist-just in case. Oh, and your numbness sounds exactly like mine.  I've just started noticing when I touch the outside of my breast-just before the armpit area-that I feel a tingle around on my shoulderblade!  I think things might be coming back!!!! Don't know what a v-scan is, Carol.  (But then I wasn't always paying attention to the names of all the rads scans-of which there were many.)  Hope you're able to get a massage, anyway. Oh, yeah, I should comment on CathyCA's friction cream, too.  Frankly, I'd be delighted just to have some friction! Yeah, SIS Kimberly, life is good.  Have a ball in the Windy City.  We'll all be thinking of you. Whipped cream!!!  Of course!!!  (Now for the practical side of me-who's cleaning up the mess?) I want your dinner, Carol.  We're getting delivered pizza tonight because college girl misses our old Friday night tradition...  (Guess I could eat that with wine...) Ah Julie, another Jewel taking her survivor lap.  It feels good, doesn't it? Weedblock does not work.  We just do it the old fashioned way.  I keep meaning to mulch after I weed, because that DOES seem to help some, but I'm usually too tired after the weeding is completed.  I think I'll do mulch next Spring as dd will have her grad party then.  (Now there's a fine way to procrastinate!) Just getting to LJ's comments about cording, which completely agrees with everything I've learned about it.  (Don't even TRY to tell me I wouldn't be able to find you-you're describing my hair, too, you know!)  (C'mon, make the appointment, everyone will be happier to know it's JUST cording and you'll get some better exercises to do.) Hey Carol, good luck in your \"Race\" tomorrow.  I hope you have great weather.  What a feel good event that is. Sorry about the \"we're getting older\" slap, Jenn.  (I believe we're getting better!)  I know the Taxotere is contributing because things cannot just change overnight as they appear that they have, but I think our recovery will be a bit longer for those of us a little longer of tooth. Fish tacos can be very tasty.  Try them sometime.  If you don't like them, just fill up on the chips and salsa on the table and have a margarita! Herceptin for the weeds!!!  LOL! On that note.  Happy Friday, Jewels. D1",

Sunday looked like a slow day for our thread-guess we're all as busy as Carol!  (Oh, and PALady's right, they take films every week to see how things are going, so don't be surprised when they spring that on you.) I'm with Carol and PALady, it's so nice when your kids go off to work.  Dd has hung on to the same part time job for, hmmm, she's starting her 3rd year with them this month.  She just turned 17 and is one of the most dependable, responsible people I know.  I just gave her $20 yesty (a day off) to clean all the outdoor furnishings (you know, scrub down with dish soap and really go over everything for the summer).  She's one of those kids who will not only get out all of the supplies she needs for a job-but puts it all away when she's done!  She has her issues (doesn't like to be the best at anything as she hates the spotlight, so sometimes sabotages herself), but a good kid overall.  College girl started her internship yesty and met the Senator already.  She really likes the experience so far-but I wish she'd return the body lotion to my bathroom after she borrows it so I don't have to run around the house all nekky.  But, yeah, I feel like the dh and I have done something right when they both toddle off to work. PALady, does the Preen kill off surrounding plants that one WANTS to keep?  I don't want to spray anything that will kill the good stuff-such as it is. $52 in tips???  Wow, Carol, I think my kids should consider getting out of retail and in to food service!  (But those hours are a killer.  Nice thing about dd's job is that the store closes every night at 6:30p-plenty early for dinner and homework during the school year and time for playing with pals in the summer.) Oh, before I forget, Carol (and anyone else embarking on rads), it's a good idea to take in cookies or a plant or something about midway through your tx to bribe them.  You'll be glad you did if they have to squeeze you in somewhere down the road (happened to me and I was able to stay on schedule despite some mechanical malfunctions during tx).  I did pick up a cross-body bag on Sunday.  It wasn't the one I really wanted (the color on that one was just too light for me-looked like a beacon on my hip), but it'll do.  It has a top zip main compartment with a zippered pocket inside that is perfect for passports and health cards.  The main compartment will accommodate 2 glasses cases (good for when I'm back in contacts and will have to carry reading and sunglasses) and a comb, lip gloss, tampons.  Then it has a zippered pocket on the outside that's gusseted with holders for credit cards/paper currency/license (for when I carry that).  The only thing that's missing is a little zippered holder for change, but I'll figure something out.  I like it because it lays fairly flat against my hip and the handle attachments appear to be quite sturdy.  College girl thought it was cute, so that's a go for me.  Dh was wondering why I had to spend money on it... Tina-the open house sounds like it was \"great success\" (read that in your best Borat voice-that's how I typed it).  I lol at the leftover food-I KNOW that will be us next year.  Take the deviled eggs in to the office-everyone loves deviled eggs and they're so easy to pop in your mouth.  I hate the thought of them heading to the trash bin.  (Send them here???) Hey, what se's are you having with the tamox so far?  I can only identify increased hot flashes, the desire to cry at the drop of a hat, and muscle cramps.  (No weight loss so far, sorry PALady!)  My appointment with my gyn to get my baseline underway is today-in a sick way I'm looking forward to it. And yeah, I got the transition bifocals built in to the rx sunglasses!  Like you, I'm looking forward to being able to read maps! Glad your open house went well, KathyL.  You guys are in the same weather pattern as my neck of the woods, so I'm all too familiar with the 5p thunderstorms.  You made me smile with the recommendation to UD for the weather-we keep trying to sell her on William & Mary for weather reasons, but she won't hear of it.  Apparently, W&M has the highest student suicide rate of all colleges.  Who knew?  We told her she wouldn't have to kill herself to go there, but she seems to be holding that stat against the school.  Kids and their decision processes... Wow, Julie!  I think STL had more people than DC for the Race!  That's an amazing photo.  I hope you can stick to your \"kick start.\"  Exercise is so critical for all of us. Great photo of you and dh, Paula.  So glad the trip to the Big D went well.  Isn't Dealey Plaza a weird place to visit?  For some reason it has this vibe that kinda creeps me out.  The whole history of it was probably cool for your kids, tho (hard for me to believe that's ancient history to today's high schoolers as I'm one of those who remembers where I was when I heard the news...). I'm SOOOOOO glad dh was seizure free during the trip.  A bit of acne seems like a small price to pay in the se realm, but easy for me to say as I'm not the one with the acne.  I just hope, hope, hope this will work for dh.  Fingers are crossed. I thought the boost area was pretty big, too.  Mine was about a 3\" circle.  It's really the only part of me that still gets irritated when it's hot outside.  I also notice that if I take a shower that's a bit warm, that I have a 3\" red circle on my chest.  My radonc said it would be about six months before everything would behave normally again.  Hang in on the boosts-the finish is truly in sight. Oh, dd is up!  Guess I'll see if I can motivate her to action and get to the gym.  I'll give the post-gyn report later/tomorrow. D1",

Carol, my most amazing lotion had aloe vera, lanolin, collagen, vitamin e and I forget what else, but all good stuff.  Aloe really is the king, so do run that by your radonc.  Perhaps you can use a pure aloe vera lotion after your appointments and save the sticky stuff for bedtime, when you can just put on an old t-shirt. Now, I want to know, can we use Aquaphor instead of gasoline?  Both from crude... Back from the gyn.  He's not that old, Carol.  Maybe 10 years on me (that puts him at 60 for those of you experiencing math difficulties).  I like him because he's not quick to use drugs to combat things--he prefers natural healing techniques (I know, so unlike me, but I'm not big into drugs--anymore, anyway).  He's going to order a supplement for me that contains Vit B6, soy, black cohash, flaxseed oil and evening primrose (I think I'm reading his writing correctly).  This supplement is supposed to help with the hot flashes.  I hope it arrives soon!  He's also going to do a pelvic sonogram on me next time to look for any new growths in my uterus or ovaries to help me rest easier about the Tamox.  He did say Tamox is a good drug and that I should relax about it.  That helped me a lot.  He also told me that he's struggling with several patients my age who are rebelling against long term drug therapies.  He said part of the problem is that we're just getting older and suddenly have health issues, when just a year ago we were healthy as could be.  He told me that I'm normal (news to me--wait till I tell my family!) and just allow aging to happen gracefully.  And to take my drugs.  Urgh.  Oh, and I have to go back on Thursday morning after fasting and have bloodwork done to check cholesterol and all that good stuff.  Oh, boy. Otherwise, he declared me fit.  Oh damn, just remembered that I forgot to ask him about intimacy while taking Tamox (not that it's pending, but a girl can hope, can't she?).  I wonder if I can ask the nurse on Thursday and have her relay the question to him.  If I remember, that's what I'll do. I also saw my legu and rotator specialist today (the legu is letting the rotator girl use part of her time, since there aren't any openings in the rotator's schedule).  The rotator said she has to start on loosening my chest wall before she can even work on the rotator.  Apparently, my surgeries really screwed up my muscles in my chest--I guess he was really hacking around in there.  So I think I have a ways to go...  As long as they can get me moving painfree again, I don't care. Only other excitement in my house is that my dog and I both have hair appointments tomorrow.  She's getting her summer 'do and a mani/pedi.  I'm looking in to some color for this gray.  My mil told me on Sunday she thought I looked \"arty.\"  I'm not sure if that's a compliment...  The dh and daughters all say color it.  So off I go.  I could stand to lose 10 years--particularly since my gyn called me old today! Later. D1",

Sherry, rads are easy compared to chemo, but they're not a cakewalk.  I can totally relate to nipple issues-I had them, too.  Keep lubricating (I still am 7 weeks after rads) and rest when you need to.  Wedding plans sound like they're moving right along-enjoy.  And we kicked cancer in the ASS.  Don't you forget it. Well, I wouldn't have wished it for you, LJ.  The rad sim can be a PITA.  I thought it was just me, but after hearing all of you, I'm realizing it is a PITA.  (BTW, I bled like a stuck pig when I got my tats, too.)  You know, I think part of the tat pain is due to the fact that they have you all exposed with your arm above your head and head turned to the side where you can't see them coming.  It's a conspiracy.  If we were getting thunderbolts or something cool tattooed on our boobs, we wouldn't even notice... I'm also interested to see how many of us are starting to need p/t for shoulder-related issues.  Did anyone hear about this from their surgeon?  (Talk about conspiracy theories.) Thank you for checking in to your le clinic.  I hope it's nothing and you're going to be pissed at me for encouraging you to take the time from your life to get it checked out... Julie-thanks so much for acknowledging my toenail.  My family hasn't been as supportive as I needed.  Dh tried out his \"it sucks for you\" line (I taught him that one when I was feeling shitty during chemo), but college girl took the cake when she said, \"Mom, I don't feel sorry for you.  While I was playing basketball all of my toenails fell off at one time or another.\"  Well, losing your nails because you bought shitty shoes is not my problem.  I've never lost a nail in my life.  I know it will be kinda okay in the end, I just needed someone to moan with me.  So thanks. So, WVgirl, my dense boobed friend, who cares where the dh is-you had quality time with a girlfriend! Joan, thanks for the info on winter.  Dd is getting dangerously obsessed with Vassar.  I hope she gets in.  Are the kids there okay?  My girl is liberal, open-minded, and doesn't need to moor to a particular dock.  But she has a side that needs a lot of down time for writing and guitar playing.  She wants to be somewhere where there isn't a lot of social judgment and encouragement to think outside of the box.  From what you know about the reputation of Vassar, is she barking up the right tree? Bichon Frise?  Cute dogs.  But no eyebrows (ours is a schnauzer mix, so the eyebrows are a big part of the look).  Oh, and $200 is just the tip of the iceberg.  I'm about to pony up $400 to have our girl's teeth cleaned (okay, first time we've done it in 9 years, but still...).  Enjoy the puppy, though, that time goes so quickly. KathyL, while your house is probably as clean as mine (you seem to be made from a similar mold), I must admit that I'm not particularly interested in traveling to DE to clean your house.  Please don't take offense.  I'm all about helping folks save a few sheckles, but... Good to hear the MUGA is normal.  I do think you're smart to start an exercise program, though.  You're young and if you make it habit, you'll reap benefits for many years to come. (Thanks for commiserating about my toenail, too.  As you all remember, that was something I didn't want to deal with.) Keep those kids healthy for the rest of the summer, will you???? Okay, guess I'll join the family for a movie.  They already started it, but it doesn't sound like something I'd like, so I'm hanging here. Till tomorrow. D1",

Sherry-the pics are great!!!  Your wig is one of the most natural looking I've seen.  You look great in it.  I didn't shed skin in the manner you describe.  I only peeled on my nipple (which blistered, so it was to be expected) and in the area of my boosts.  And that peel was strange-it was like the tops of all my hair follicles died and these little circles peeled off all over.   But it never came off in a strip, like a sunburn peel does.  (Hope that made sense.) My Tamox side effects are increased hot flashes, the urge to cry at the drop of a hat, and muscle cramps (mostly in my legs like when I was pregnant).  I was in Trader Joe's today and picked up the calcium chews LJ recommended and also spotted some black cohosh so I picked it up, too (not waiting for my gyn to get the stuff in he wants me to try).  I'll let you guys know if it helps with the hot flashes. Ah, the learner's permit!  My kids said I went into a zen-like trance whenever I drove with them.  What they don't know is that if I didn't go into a trance, I would've been a mess!   Luckily, I survived, and I suspect you will, too, Paula. Hey enjoy your cation to the beach.  Breaks are good for all of us.  It's after 3p here.  I think I'm going to take a shower (haven't done that, yet today and the stink from my outing to the gym is grossing me out) and then see if I feel up to check in to the nail salon to see if my girl can do anything with my missing toenail.  She doesn't work tomorrow and my sis and her family arrive tomorrow (I may go MIA on you for a few days while she's here), so I'm thinking today is it.  (That was a run-on sentence, now wasn't it?) Thanks, everyone, for the nice compliments about my new \u2018do.  People who see me around here keep saying that I should keep it this short (I think NOT).  But it's good for summer!

You had me lol, girl, with the thought of you barking along with the dogs as you pulled into your drive!  What a vision!  Oh man, my hair is all over the place, too.  I sure seem to have a boatload of cowlicks.  My sister (the one who did chemo 2 years ago) said she didn't think I was going to get curls because she did curl up after chemo and apparently her hair was totally different than mine.  I was disappointed at first, but now I'm to the point that I just want hair.  I'm starting to get lots of positive comments on it, and I think most people really mean it.  I may keep it short for a while-it's SO easy, but maybe not this short... Thanks for validating my hesitancy on the genetic testing.  I'm not sure why I pause...I hope a good reason comes to me soon.  Of course, I still have to talk it over with the dh... Now, Deb, (great pic in the avatar, btw), Vitamin D.  I've been doing some reading that indicates vit D is helpful in Tamoxifen metabolism.  So maybe we need to revisit the whole sun worshiping thing, since it's been a topic lately.  ;)  I have not added vit D to my handful of pills, but I'm going to switch to Citracal w/D as soon as I finish off the calcium chews I have.  Turns out it might be a plus for the Tamox, too.  I don't know if a D deficiency would explain your burning/hurting.  Are you scheduled to see any other people on your med team before Aug. 5?  Maybe you could run it by them.  I do think getting on that tm is REALLY important (WTF, I'm having a hot flash right now-okay, that was a total sidebar).  I'm kinda dismayed by all the pills I take every day, but I'm starting to think the supplements are really important right now.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I figure they can't hurt.  (btw, those big toenails are ugly when they fall off-I much prefer the others, but who gets a choice in this???) Oh, and update on my beloved Kippy (our dog).  She is home now, but really moping around.  I have painkillers and antibiotics to give her, as well as canned dog food (special diet) for a couple of days.  You can tell she really wants us all to be home because when I opened the door to get the mail, she came out and started crying, thinking something good was about to happen.  What a let down that I only came in with mail...  I haven't had the heart to pull her lips back to admire her clean teeth, yet.  That indignity can wait till tomorrow.  But you better believe that at that price, I'm going to be doing a lot of admiring! Till tomorrow, gang. D1",

Your trip to San Fran sounds great, SIS Kimberly!  And another score for you on the bottle of wine (frequently the most expensive item on the tab, so WTG!).  No bras, yet.  They must be coming by pony express. Boy, I hope we can reconnect our relationship.  It's been too long since we've been in romantic love, if you know what I mean.  Our friendship love is quite strong, but we both know there's more to a marriage than that.  Our issue is finding/making time for each other. Another WOW to you on your reply to LWDana.  Your advice is always so spot on.  I was saddened to read about the hardships you endured as a child, but wonder if that is part of how you have become such a thoughtful advisor.  You clearly have spent a lot of time grappling with your feelings about your experiences and have sorted things out to the point where you are able to have healthy relationships with your family and friends.  An already impressive woman manages to impress again.  I'm honored to know you. Ah, KathyL, I fondly remember the days when a few hours at the pool would tucker my girls out.  In a way, I miss those times (but not the part where I had to get into the water with them...).  Enjoy them while they last-it really does pass quickly. So Carol, how'd the ds do?  I know his training regimen wasn't up to his former standard (dastardly jobs get in the way), but was he able to meet his personal goals at Nationals?  What a great experience that is.  Oh, you hit the nail right on the head with the bones.  The vet said it would be a good idea to skip them from here on out.  No problemo, IMO.  She'll never miss them.  And I won't miss the dental bills! Are you kidding me?  Dh used to work on one of those crabbing boats?!  You're lucky to have him in your life, then.  That looks like one dangerous job!  Thank god he's not doing that anymore. Ugh, LJ, there's no way I'd have made an 8:40am rads appointment.  Mine was at 11:10, which meant I had to get up and get outta the house for the gym by 8:15 so I could shower before rads-but all I had to do to go to the gym was roll outta bed and pull on my gym clothes.  If I had to get around for the day in time for an 8:40 appointment, I'd never make it.  You have my sympathy. I second your admiration of Paula's dh's courage.  What a great way to put it. Oh, and I'm getting tons of compliments on my hair, too!  I may mess with a shorter style for a while (but not this short...).  It's fun. Ah, PALady, you remind me.  I keep meaning to check with Deb on head hair.  Deb, PALady and I both experienced new hair growth in areas we'd had laser hair removal.  I'm hoping that means you may experience some new hair growth, too.  Any luck? Back to PALady.  I LOVE Cedar Point!  I haven't been there in at least 30 years, but we went once a year for about 7 years running (I grew up in Flint, MI).  I hear it's become quite the place for roller coaster fans. The tamox hasn't been so bad for me.  Just more hot flashes (not life threatening), leg cramps (not life threatening), and an increased urge to cry (not life threatening).  It really wasn't what I feared-so far.  I hope it goes okay for you. Sounds like you're doing a lot of things designed to get you back into balance.  Good for you.  LOL on using my middle finger with my surgeon!  He's such a butt. Man, Deb, I hear you on the toenails.  I know I'm going to lose my other big one and it aches all the time.  I'm ready (sort of) for it to fall off so I can get on with it.  Boo-hoo any old time!  Good job on the preventative work for le.  And I know you're going to be on that tm any day now... Well, my natives are restless and want dinner.  Guess I should toddle off and do my thang. D1",

On the way home we stopped at the jewelers and they cleaned my ring for me (and complimented my hair growth, which made me feel good).  Tomorrow is my anniversary, so I figured I'd better make it sparkle.  While I was there, I looked at the options for a medic alert bracelet.  I think I'm going to put it on my Christmas list for next year.  I found out you don't have to have that \"in your face\" red stamp thingy, but you can just do an engraved version-which is more tasteful IMO.  I'm thinking I'm going to need one because I cannot have blood pressure, blood draws, or injections on my left arm ever again and if I'm in an emergency I may not be able to communicate that information.  Now I have to figure out what I'm supposed to have written on the back as my instructions.  I figure I'll check with my legu to see what she recommends. Thanks, everyone, for your get well wishes for Kippy.  Sometime around 4 yesty afternoon she seemed to emerge from the haze.  I still have her on the painkillers and I think I'll start weaning her off of those tomorrow (the doc said 3-5 days, so I'll gradually get her off of them, rather than cold turkey and see how it goes).  I did sneak a peek at her choppers and had to get my sunglasses!!! LWDana-Just because they don't file charges doesn't mean they aren't going to use your testimony.  They may have other cases that are stronger than yours which they'll use in the charges and just use your account to bolster their case.  These guys are playing to win and that's what you want in the end, too, so try not to be so quick to be discouraged.  Keep your wits about you and listen carefully to what they're recommending to you and just be honest.  The rest will work out. Sista-you're right on to suggest the swelling as a se of those \"t\" drugs.  Something to throw in to the mix, Deb. How does one \"power water?\"  The vision in my head is hysterical!  I'll have to go check out the link to the skating, Carol, thanks for sharing.  You know, we've talked about counseling before, but the dh really doesn't like the idea at all.  He says I just need to be more communicative and we can take care of things ourselves.  We've been working on this for four years, now, I'm just learning a lot about patience.  (And you know, every once in a while things are very, very good.  Just today he texted \"R U my anniversary buddy?\" to me.) WooHoo  to CHJ!!!  Rads are done!  I know that was not your favorite part, so let's get started putting that memory behind us!  The energy will return.  Try to exercise as much as you can stand as it will help the energy return a bit sooner.  Hit-or-miss and lurking are always welcome, not to worry.  Just check in periodically so we know what's up with you. Ugh, Paula, the dh's tummy must be in a really bad way if he's planning his funeral.  Be sure you check with his docs on what he can be taking to alleviate the symptoms.  Too many Jewels had tummy troubles with tx, so I'm sure there's a lot of sympathetic moaning going on.  Bummer, it sounds like your cation to CA is off.  I know it's probably the best choice for you right now, but I can hear your disappointment.  Don't you worry, we'll all get together eventually. Oh Maz, I'm so sorry to hear about your dad.  You've had a rough go of it, haven't you?  That just doesn't seem fair.  It sounds like everyone should be able to wait till you're ready for the sea burial.  What a moving event that will be.  Try to take a walk each day to keep your blood pressure under control-this will be over soon (I know, not soon enough).  I think maybe a little fresh air and some good old fashioned heart pumping will keep you out of the ER, too.  You can do everything that's being asked of you-you're a lot stronger than I think you realize. SIS Kimberly-observant catch on the \"hope\" vs. \"know.\"  It didn't even register with me when I typed it.  See, there's your \"work\" and \"soul searching\" benefitting others! Glad your new housekeeper passed the test.  I hate breaking new ones in. Oh, wow, my dd just got the mail (Kip was even up to bark like a mad dog at the mailman-she's def feeling better), and her AP test scores arrived today.  She took 3 AP classes last year (and is taking 3 again next year).  In VA, if you score 3 or higher and go to a state school, you get college credit for the AP class.  If you attend a college out of state (Vassar, is, of course, out of state for us), then you have to get a 4 or 5 on the AP exam for college credit.  A 5 is the highest score you can get.  So her results just came in-3 in US/VA History, 5 in Psychology, and 5 in English/Literature.  May I say WOW and brag a bit???  Okay, I'm going to run off and straighten up a bit and do some dusting.  My curtains arrive today and I want the windows to be clean for the installation.  Gosh, I hope we like the fabric done up as a whole curtain, vs. the scrap we held up to the windows...

So, let's see what's up... PALady-I'm surprised you survived the \"sleepover\" in such good humor.  The kids always seem to stay up all night at our house, which means no one gets much sleep!  The vet said it was real bones-not the rawhides that did Kip's teeth in.  You  gotta be able to give them SOMETHING to chew on, or all your socks and underwear would be destroyed!  Oh, and yes, I'm painting what it left of my toenail.  I don't know if I'd call them decent, but it is what it is. You know, I'm still having some lingering stiffness in one ankle from the Taxotere, so I'm not surprised to hear about your legs.  When I stay in one position for too long, everything is stiff (I wasn't like this before), but I really notice my left ankle is sore all the time.  Good news is that it is getting better, so I remain optimistic. Thanks, Sherry, for sharing the story about your aunt.  It's been a long time since we've seen our friend.  His wife went to grad school in TX with my dh (I was doing undergrad there) and we become VERY good friends with her.  As soon as we all graduated, we left TX for this area and she met her husband to be here.  He became part of our circle of friends, too.  When their oldest was around 3 years old they moved their family to the San Fran area, so we haven't seen them as much as we used to (we both stayed with one another a couple of times over the years, but it never seemed often enough).  Right now, the wife has taken the kids to spend a week or so at the grandparents house in CO (they did this every summer) and is organizing memorial plans from there.  I don't know if it will be the kind of thing one attends, or not.  We'll have to wait and see what she decides. Okay, Carol, yikes on the \"hot spots.\"  I'm not a marathon walker, like you and CathyCA, so I'm not even sure what to suggest.  I hope you figure something out.  It would not be good to develop them on your 3 day.  I can't believe TSA let the ds board a plane without photo id.  I got a little shit last time when they looked at the id with long hair and at me with none! CathyCA-another busy Jewel!  Good suggestions to Julie about the all-inclusive thing.  I don't think I've ever done one of those, so I wouldn't even know where to begin. Good advice to Carol on her hot spots.  I knew you'd be the one to have some. Sounds like your experience with \"sleepovers\" is about the same as mine! Everyone must be busy this weekend-hooray!  I'll stop by tomorrow and see what's up. D1",

I'm still cracking up over your Sun Chips fiasco.  I agree with whoever said Sun Chips are healthy.  And I eat pretty healthy stuff as a norm. Glad the tootsies recovered and survived another walk, Carol.  A major blowout would not be good for you right now.   Whew that the dh didn't have to \"show force\" for too long.

Hope the wisdom teeth extractions went okay, CathyCA.  My oldest had hers done a couple of years ago and it was not fun or pretty.  Now my little one is not at all interested in having hers removed.  Luckily, she appears to only have one and it's not a threat to all that orthodontia we had done on her, so...

LJ, you crack me up.  Keep that good info (along with your dry wit) comin'! We've been screwed around with escrow before, too, SIS Kimberly.  It's such a bite because it doesn't get you any closer to owning your home outright, but you have to pay it.  $300 a month is a chunk of change, imo, sucks. Yeah, and I need to second your feelings about Carol's walking.  That IS impressive, Carol!  Keep up the good work. Salmon salad sounds good.  I, on the other hand, am not going to be as healthy tonight.  I just made lasagna rolls (lasagna noodles spread with ricotta, spinach and prosciutto then rolled up and served on a béchamel bed with marinara on top), and will whip up some roasted sweet potatoes with garlic and rosemary to go with a fruit salad (which is not our dessert-it counts as a veggie!).  For dessert, we have a peach kuchen the dh made before he left for his latest round of travel.  Luckily, dh managed to catch an earlier flight home tonight, so he'll be here around 8:30.  Then tomorrow he heads out again till Friday night.  Glad its him and not me. The cost of those garments was for the original corset thing I wear and a custom sleeve.  The retailer from whom I purchased it is VERY slow on insurance filings.  Now I understand why-they don't participate!  Grrr.  I saw my legu today who said she'd call them to see if she can get me any relief.  I'll take what I can get.  It does make me want to redouble my efforts to find a cheaper alternative, though. I have never been weepy in my life (although when I do manage tears, I have the dh in the palm of my hand-I should really figure out how to use that to my benefit).  I blame this all squarely on the Tamox. KathyL-we've already blasted through our HSA for this year.  We maxed it out, too, with all the bc exps.  I think they are great plans (although I'm not sure I completely understand how ours works-I just present the special card until people tell me it's been rejected!). Holy moly, Kathy!  I'm reading about your surprise visit to the onc.  I'da been scared half to death.  I think this cancer stuff is going to dog all of us for much longer than we think. Yeowch, Carol, a weepy day for you, too (good thing you didn't call, we'da been wailing at each other over the phone).  I'll bet some of that rad fatigue is starting to nip at your heels.  The exercise will help you, but I'm not sure you can totally avoid it.  I found that at about 3p I needed to just sit and stare into space for about a half hour and then I'd get a second wind to get me to bedtime at 9.  Give yourself some space. Yep, 6 down, 4 to go.  Last night I chopped my surviving nails off REAL short, so you can't really tell which ones have jumped ship-except for the big ones, they're nasty.  It looks like I may lose three more eventually, but there's my one pinkie, hanging on for dear life! I'm going with \"if you know what I mean,\" Carol. Way to follow up on the dr furniture, Paula.  So, LJ, are there angels, yet? And there's the answer on IYKWIM from Paula!  I think I should get a prize for getting it right!!!!! OMG, SIS Kimberly, I was SOOOOO bad.  Dh had made some homemade trail mix (basically that chex cereal mix without nuts and very spicy), so I dipped in to that.  Luckily, I measured out a cup for myself and didn't allow seconds.  Then I moved on to a G&T to put out the fire in my mouth... Yay, Julie, more time on the boat!  I'm so glad you're getting some r&r in on your boat before your surgery, just in case you don't feel up to it afterward.  Maybe you'll get some more time in on it this weekend.  I hope you're able to get your insurance thing straightened out.  Like a path report shouldn't be covered.  Give us a break. I'm going to wrap up now.  My plumber is due here any minute and I don't want to lose this tome while I'm off showing him the plumbing problems. Later. D1",

Hooray that the dental ordeal went okay.  I think the anticipation is always much worse than the actual thing in those cases.  Ouch on the non-insured tooth.  Sounds like we're all having $$ issues right now.  Perhaps it's the economy, stupid. SIS Kimberly, you make me smile.  You know how I got started cleaning the house so much?  When I moved into my first apartment, I was a student and found that I could justify procrastinating on my studies if I was putting it off to clean.  Then I realized that I got a buzz off of looking around my pristine digs and an obsession was borne!  Maybe you can turn your procrastination into some new and groovy obsession! Peach kuchen is a peach cobbler thingy.  There's a cobbler crust on the bottom, peaches, sour cream, sugar-all the good stuff.  The kids like it served warm with a scoop of ice cream.  I like mine warm with some milk.  Bad for the diet, but hey, it has peaches in it... Dh makes a mean vegetarian zucchini lasagna.  What's not to like with veggies and cheese? Plumber snaked the drain in the girls' tub and found a wad of hair about 5 feet down the pipes.  It looked reminiscent of the rodents I was leaving in the drain back in January, but I didn't say anything to the plumber-didn't want to make him uncomfortable with the whole balditude thing.  Besides, he sports a long pony tail and likely has never had a bald day in his life.  He also checked out the sump pump to make sure it didn't need to be cleaned out, since we're having these torrential rains these hot summer days.  It was good and he charged me-get this--$249!!!  Can one get insurance for the plumbing bills??? So you had fun at your pinup calendar shoot, eh, PALady?  Any whipped cream involved???  (Where is my mind?) The cancer cell machine sounds amazing.  It would be great if it works.  And you must be feeling pretty good to be a part of the research as a source of funding. Carol, no, I did not have exit burning on my back, although I've heard it's not uncommon.  How lucky for you.  Not.  Been thinking about you a lot today, hope it's cause you're having a good day.  How'd the hair come out? Ah, so the angels are singing for the cats, LJ? Jenn, I'm sitting here lol at the thought of you rummaging thru your fridge till you find a Corona and a lime... I hope Thumper continues to recover.  I had no idea that glaucoma could blind one so quickly.  Isn't glaucoma the condition that is helped by smoking a joint??  Now there's an idea.  (I am just sick.  Would someone please take me away?) Julie-you need to know that I am relatively new to cooking (about 10 years).  I dodged the main-cook-for-the-family bullet when I first started dating my dh and he asked me to fry a burger for him while he showered.  He emerged from the bathroom to find his apartment filled with smoke and me merrily \"cooking\" for him.  Right then and there he said he would do the cooking.  Fine with me.  He's actually a gourmet cook.  When he gets to cooking on the weekends, Katie Bar the Door!  I mostly cook day to day, (read that to say I can grill), but in the past couple of years I've gotten more adventurous.  It's kinda fun, actually.  Particularly when everyone likes what I make.  The best part is, if I put everything I need on the grocery list, dh will do the shopping! Tomorrow on the menu is a chicken quesadilla, salad and fresh fruit.  I grilled the chicken tonight while I was grilling tonight's dinner, so tomorrow will be just assembly.  Sounds good to me.  Hey, I think a Corona and lime would go great with that meal-Jenn, where are you? Have a great time in Tahoe, Kimberly. D1",

I didn't really do much yesty, I did spend a lot of time reading my mom's manuscript.  She's trying to write a book (who isn't?) and I've been reading it for her now and then.  The last time I read it was a year ago and I must say, it's come a long way since then.  I'm not really sure what she's going to do with herself when she decides this is finished-I imagine she's going to try to shop it to get it published.  Whatever, as long as it keeps her mentally engaged and off the streets... LWDana-I see you're headed to Puerto Vallarta and Cabo.  That should be a great trip.  I've been to Puerto Vallarta and found the village to be an interesting way to spend a day.   The architecture is fun and there's a small market for bargaining.  Always a draw for me is a place to sit outside and have a beer and watch people and there are places for that, too.  I haven't been to Cabo, but my sister keeps recommending it.  I'll be interested to hear what you have to say.  So when will you take this trip?  (I laughed when I read that you have a fear of heights but figure if cancer hasn't killed you, then you'll try the zip line.  Just don't look down!) First of all, Carol, major bummer about the computer stuff.  I HATE figuring all of that out.  I can totally empathize.  But hooray that you only have 10 more tanning sessions.  That countdown begins to be such a relief.  And you'll probably find the boosts go more quickly than what you've done so far.  Although my boost area was a big 3\" circle, so don't be surprised. I've not ever tried cave tubing, CathyCA.  I'm thinking my claustrophobia (see, LWDana, I've got my hang-ups, too), will prevent that.  I've not been to Belize, either, even though I float the idea every Spring.  Someday.  Why don't you try both Belize and the tubing and let me know if I should pursue... Julie-I hear you on the yard sale stuff not coming back into the house.  We always load up whatever doesn't sell and take it to Goodwill.  I hope you guys get rid of everything! Oh, we're headed to Croatia and Turkey for our cation.  We're sticking to the Dalmation Coast in Croatia, so we'll be on the coast the whole time (ummmm, seafood!).  It should be interesting as we tend to plan our own cations and therefore are responsible for our own transfers.  So in Croatia, we're going to take the public bus system from Dubrovnik for 4+ hours to a town called Split, where we will catch a ferry to take us to one of the islands.  I'm hoping in Croatia they don't allow chickens on the busses, as we've travelled with chickens before and they stink and make too much noise.  Better have my iPod charged up for that leg of the journey!  I'm looking forward to Istanbul, too.  Don't know if you guys ever saw the movie, \"Midnight Express,\" but the prison featured in that film has been turned in to a hotel and we're going to stay in it!  The fitness center is in the dungeon.  I'm so jazzed!  Then we're renting a car and are going to drive to some ruins that are supposed to be better than those in Rome.  When we're in that area, we're staying in a guest house with some locals in farming country-there will be much pointing and pantomime to communicate!  It will be an adventure, that's for sure. Hooray to SIS Kimberly for all that progress on your curriculum!  You probably feel as though a weight has been lifted.  Hang in there with the HOA.  Those folks sometimes get carried away with all the power (we had an altercation one time over the color of fabric we used to line our curtains-seemed they wanted beige and we went with an off-white-a stupid waste of everyone's time, imo).  More info from LWDana on her trip-snorkeling and swimming with dolphins!  That sounds like my kind of activity.  Before I got married I was a certified scuba diver (I was always a little chicken when there was danger in the water, but I was always up for appreciating the beauty), but my dh doesn't swim, so I don't do water things as much as I used to.  Every once in a while I'll go off and snorkel on a trip and leave him on land, but we don't do that often.  You'll have to let me know how the dolphin swim goes.  That's probably one of those bucket list items I'll never cross off... Good for you, Carol, sticking with your walking.  I'm always so impressed.  I know I couldn't walk 18 miles in one day.  The dh was just showing me this morning the route we're walking from our hotel in Dubrovnik to the bus station and it's about 1 mile.  Normally, not bad, but we'll be lugging all our stuff.  (Our travel style supports the \"lugging\"-we each take one carry-on size suitcase with wheels and one backpack, that's it, no matter how long we're gone).  I hope the streets are not all cobblestone... WoooHooo to Therese for making it through that first check-up.  I can totally understand how you felt about going in there.  I have mine in September and when I think about it I get that nagging feeling of dread in the back of my mind.  I'm hoping that feeling doesn't last long for any of us.  Celebrate the fact that you only have time to check in once in a while-that's a good thing. Well, we shipped dd off to yearbook camp this morning.  She's going to be co-editor next year so the other editor and her mom drove them to the camp (2 hour drive).  I'm in charge of picking them up late Tuesday afternoon after my p/t.  Dd was so cute, she didn't want me or dh to come outside to say goodbye to her.  God forbid we show any emotion in front of her peer!!!!  I'll miss having her around, though, she's really been a great buddy this summer. Well, it's after noon here and I haven't even  showered, yet.  Guess I should get moving. D1",

How are rads going, LJ?  I think you must be in your last week, now.  No tummy trouble on this cation, although I was prepared for it.  In fact, it went really well, healthwise.  I think I only doled out a couple of Advil... Boy, I hope I read on and see that Julie got those drains out when she expected... LWDana-I'm so glad that creep of a doc is behind bars.  I, too, feel for his family, but I imagine they are wounded on so many levels right now by his actions that jail is the least of their worries.  I hope they put that guy away for a really long time. Hey Patty, sorry to hear Denise and you aren't on the same page when it comes to tx.  It must be very difficult.  Try to remember that all of us, even those who are sisters, have our own private journey with bc and no one's is exactly the same as anyone else's.  It must be hard to support her when you don't believe she is doing everything she can, but try to remember that she gets to call her own shots and if she is willing to gamble with her tx, then that's her call.  My surgeon is still scratching his head over the fact that I chose to do chemo, but I was like you-I wanted to give this my best shot and I fell into a gray area.  Sounds like Denise wants to chose not to do chemo if she can find some info that will support that.  There's nothing wrong with that, really.  Please come by and let us know how you feel, because you've got to get this stuff off your chest.  (Is that a poor choice of words on this site?)  And I'm with you, I really needed the support here to get through it, but again, we're all different and your sister is coping her own way.  Good thing we'll be here if she changes her mind! The trip to Ashland sounds really nice, SIS Kimberly.  Right up my alley, actually.  Glad you all had a good time.  It's hard to believe school is around the corner!  I'm feeling for you. KathyL-Well, I thought we might be taking a trip to Rehoboth for school clothes (tax free-an added benefit!), but we're going to do some college visits, instead.  Poopy doo.  I was hoping for a chance to meet you.  I think we're headed to NYC for one school still tbd and then on to Connecticut to visit Wesleyan.  I'm excited to see some of the schools in which dd is interested, so it's not a total loss, imo.  Can't wait to read up on your cation, you're probably there, now. You amaze me, Carol, with your dedication to preparing yourself for your 3-day.  I loved your weekend report-it made me feel like I was right there.  I remember when I used to take my scout troops camping (the sacrifices we make for our kids...) and the parent chaperones would all get the giggles at bedtime.  It's fun.   So sorry your pancake gave you some trouble.  I hope by now you're on your way to recovery. Julie, you sound really busy getting ready for school.  Hope you found some time to get your hair done.  It's so great to do it because it makes you feel normal again.  (I'm rediscovering all kinds of things that I used to take for granted.) Paula, lol on the alien child that took care of dh while you were conferencing.  Kids ARE amazing the way they can step up if we really need them.  Hope everything went well at Duke. SIS Kimberly-my family thinks I should shave as I have a lot more facial hair post chemo than I did before, and I understand this is common.  I'm hoping it goes away.  It's not very flattering.  Oh, and I still have neuropathy in my fingertips periodically-I just hadn't mentioned it because I view it more as a curiosity than a problem, but yep, I got that, too.  No major butt bruises, though.  You're on your own there. Ah Kris, you have the facial hair, too, huh?  I've been afraid to do anything about it for the very same reason you're avoiding yours.  Let's hope it falls out... And Paula, too?!  I was lol at the thought of moonlighting as Santa this winter.  I'll have to use that one, if you don't mind.  I don't want to wax... LJ, see you chirping in on the facial hair, too.  It reminds me to say I was impressed with your response to Patty.  It's right on. A tick on you, too, Julie?  It's always sumthin'.  Perhaps it was attracted by your facial hair... SIS Kimberly-do you think you have a sciatica issue?  I messed up mine in a fall down the stairs about 12 years ago and still have pain every day.  The p/t I saw for my back spasms during chemo gave me some exercises to do that actually do give me some relief, but it always hurts.  Funny though, it doesn't seem to hurt as much since I've had this rotator cuff thing going on.  Guess whatever hurts the most gets your attention. Sherry-You have tons of news!  I really like the new shoes.  And they almost paid you to take them off their hands.  Way to go!!  The job situation sounds promising.  I know what you mean about jobs in MI-I've been tracking my birth state ever since I left it in 1978 when unemployment in my home town hit 25%.  I think with the gas prices, those large vehicles are going to go unsold adding more misery to a state so dependent on the auto industry.  What a shame. OMG, just reading about Cody.  What a nightmare.  The UofM Med Center is excellent, though, so hopefully he'll get the treatment he clearly needs.  I'll be thinking about him. If your ultrasound is inconclusive, ask your surgeon for a referral to a lymphedema therapist.  You may have some buildup that can be resolved with some MLD (manual lymph drainage) massage. Three cheers to Julie and her drains no more!!!!  It sounds like you're on your way. Carol, I'm cringing at your dermabrasion session at the tanning bed.  Ouchy wa wa.  I really hope I'm going to be reading of your rapid recovery here... Maz, you sound busy.  I hope you were able to find a new aide for your mom.  I think you have enough on your plate without that added.  You must be done with rads by now.  Fingers are crossed that your luck held out and that you didn't develop the skin issues Carol did.  (Yeah, that attachment was pretty weird, wasn't it?) LJ-Love the Dove bar idea!  I think we could all use one now and again. So I'm wondering if they're ever gonna do your classroom floors, SIS Kim... Carol, you crack me up.  You're all high on pain meds and still worrying about scaring the Jewels still in rads.  How you.  Anyway-WOOOOHOOOO on skipping the last zap!!!  I think you deserved that break.  I'm hoping I'm going to read about a quick heal for you here. Oh, and no chickens on the bus this time.  College girl got her knickers in a twist over some caged puppies in the bazaar in Istanbul (natch we wound up in the local bazaar-not just the tourist one).  Once she found the pups in smaller cages than the chickens, she started to cry, so we high-tailed it to the nearest watering hole to soothe her over some Turkish beers (good beer, I might add). So is there a chandelier in SIS Kim's boudoir? Loved hearing the excitement in your post, KathyL, as you prepared for your cation.  I hope you guys are having a great time. Paula-I am SOOO happy for you and Ed!  What great news from Duke!  Hopefully by changing the timing on taking the meds he can get some relief from the fatigue, but I totally hear you on the \"he can stay in bed\" line.  So what are you reading that has captured your attention?  I read \"The Boleyn Inheritance\" on the plane and really liked it.  I've actually read 3 of the Philippa Gregory books now.  I got in to the period so much that I actually read Alison Weir's book, \"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\" as well (that one was not written in as entertaining fashion as the Gregory books...). Speaking of reading, I have finished the Wendi Pedicone book,\" Hanging Out with Labcoats,\" and am happy to send it on to anyone that would like to read it.  Just let me know. Nice to see a new photo of you, Paula.  The hair looks great-about the same length as mine.  I discovered when I stopped taking the Tamoxifen for 3 weeks that my hair came in more quickly (and my eyebrows started making a comeback) so I know the Tamox is the culprit behind my slow hair growth and eyebrow loss.  That just pisses me off.  I'm hoping I don't have to wait 5-10 years (length of time I'll be taking the drug) before I get hair... Yikes, Sherry, sounds like le to me.  I'll keep reading... Ugh, a mammo, gosh I hope the results were good, KathyL... Welcome, Lucy!!!  I'm sorry you didn't find us sooner.  I don't know how on Earth I would've survived chemo without the Jewels.  But hey, join us as we get on with it-it should be fun now! Hey Sherry, maybe the rude woman at the new job was just having a bad day.  I hope it works out for the best. SIS Kim-thanks ever so much for the BR (butt report).  What a relief that you'll be able to sit again! The gift cards are a fabo idea, Carol!  Wish I'd thought of that.  Maybe for my p/t folks...  (I'm ignoring the fact that you allowed your house-sitter's room to become a shambles.  Tsk, tsk.) Actually, I think driving to CA on your own, with your own thoughts and schedule would be just what you need right now.  I hope it all went well. Check in anytime, Therese.  I'm just glad you've got so much going on in your life that bc is WAAAYYY in the back seat! Yeah, Lucy, we're all trying to figure out what caused our cancer.  We'll probably never know.  Just lousy luck, I think.  I know what you mean when you say cancer is a lonely place.  I think that's why the Jewels have been so important to me.  Hopefully, you be less lonely with us around.  And I second what SIS Kimberly said about your girls (she has such a way with words). Julie-you've started school!!!  Yikes!!  We don't start till September 2 for the high school, we take college girl back to school this Saturday.  Just today I met with dd's guidance counselor to change her science class from a sports medicine class taught at the career center to AP Enviro Science.  We talked about this on cation and decided that if she's shooting for all of these tough colleges, then she needed another AP.  This means she'll be taking 4 next year!  (English, Statistics, Spanish VI, and Enviro Sci)  Her other classes are Government and Yearbook (she's editor).  Sounds really stressful to me, but she's a smart kid and her eyes are open to the challenge. Gosh Sherry, you've had more issues with your cancer center, haven't you?  I hope you got what you needed (I'll keep reading and find out). And then the very next post there's Sherry getting a date!!!  Way to go, girl!  Now you know that your short hair and recent bout with bc is not going to stop someone who wants to spend time with YOU.  You are not cancer, you are Sherry.  Enjoy his company. Good job getting rid of the rolltop, SIS Kim! Oh, and thanks for the reminder to enjoy each moment.  I loved how you put it. I think I may have to visit Lincoln if you feed your guests like that-YUMMMMMM. Joan-a cation to CA, how wonderful!  I loved Yosemite, too.  I'm so glad you got a chance to get away.  Hope your doc appts go well. I didn't know you made your own wine, SIS Kim.  How much fun is that??! KathyL, you had me lol with the story of your family goat (I mean, dog).  Ours can be a barfer, too, so I can totally relate.  Enjoy your cation, you deserve it. SIS Kimberly-jet lag is doing better now, thanks.  Funny you should talk about reconnecting on cation.  We toured a sultan's house in Istanbul and paid the extra fee to take a look-see in his harem rooms.  They were beautiful and inspired me to try my own moves on my modern day sultan.  Well, I've decided that the sultan would have drown me for lack of performance back in the day because I was a total failure.  Dh and I laughed about my lame effort, but the drought continues... Oh man, I can't believe your HOA is making you take down your fence.  What jerks.  I'm really sorry.  Do they compensate for your financial outlay??? Sounds like you and Carol had a good time connecting in person.  I really hope many more of the Jewels are able to do the same.  (And I want to have Carol visit me-she's good with the gifts!!!!)  And yeah, I think they're good golfers, too, but knowing Carol, you'd all be laughing the whole time, so it won't matter if you don't get a chance to practice. Sounds like you've got a busy week as you push toward that first bell on Thursday.  I'll be thinking about you. Ouch, Julie, that football outcome sounds painful.  I hope ds felt like he did his best.  I always tell my girls to do their best and if you come out on the losing side, at least you can hold your head high.  I'm feeling some pain for you on the house sale and move.  Those activities always stress me out. The pix are great, SIS Kimberly!!!  Thanks for sharing. More cationing for Carol.  You go, girl.  Enjoy that hubby and have a great time. Okay Sherry, take a deep breath.  Inhale, now exhale.  Better?  (Don't do it too many times or you'll pass out!)  I'm sorry the date didn't turn out as you'd planned, but you gotta be feeling pretty good about the age thing-I wish people thought I was 15 years younger!  Sucks that the guy felt like he could drink so much.  Was he uncomfortable, perhaps, and drank to cover it up?  In the end, I'm glad you're sticking up for yourself.  One of my life sayings is \"Fuck \u2018em if they can't take a joke!\"  Sounds like you could use that one right about now.  Now, turn your thoughts to the wedding and allow yourself to get all giddy and excited about it.  I'm with you, KathyL, I really hope we all get to meet sooner rather than later. So are you guys still reading?  Good news is that I'm all caught up!!!  (But it took me two days to do this!) I think it's time for a g&t... D1",

Technically, I get my first TC treatment December 27, but those December ladies are way ahead of me, so I'm starting a new thread for the new year. Coming clean, I'm in for 4x TC 3 weeks apart.  Just signed my life away a couple of hours ago.  No port, it's going to be done via IV (and I'm psychotically afraid of needles--should be interesting).  Before this, I've had 3 lumpectomies, SNB and an anxially node dissection.  Now I have a Frankenboob (only named in the most loving sense) and an arm that \"pings\" whenever I move beyond it's comfort zone.

Joan, thanks a bunch for getting those pix posted so soon.  Dd hasn't even unloaded the one I took from her camera, yet, so thank goodness there are others here who are more techno-oriented than I! Okay, everyone, can you believe Joan's hair?  She has a buttload and its thick and curly.  I'm so jealous.  I may pitch out my Tamoxifen tabs!  Joan, it's time to ditch the head coverings and let that beautiful crown of jewels out (is that a pun around here?).  Head off to your hairdresser to get a quick lesson on how to finger-comb it and wear it proudly.  You see, I never knew you with \"hair\" before, so to me that head of locks is amazing.  Just tell everyone you got a new back to school \u2018do! Maz, maz, maz.  I'm so disappointed that I missed meeting you.  I don't know what I was thinking, but for some reason I placed you somewhere in the middle of the US.  If I had known you were so closeby, I'da tried to coordinate our meeting with you, too.  So now you need to send dd good vibes for Vassar, too, and that way I'll be in that neck of the woods a couple of times a year at least.  Have a great time in FL-don't let any bad weather chase you around.  You're a survivor, girl! Sherry, are you hitting the heating pad at night?  I remember when dd took the retail job at the toy store a few years back.  She came home all tired and achey every night-and she was 15!  Give yourself a soak in the tub, or whatever it is that relaxes you.  I'll bet you're the best cashier ever at Kmart! Okay, Carol, it's kinda sad that we all know how to approach a surgery.  But heck, I'm glad you were able to squeeze another use out of your Emla cream (so is that another pun, since it comes in a tube?).  Take it easy on your stitches for a couple of days.  You sound like you're itching to get back at it.  Give it some time, please. Sounds like ds is doing some penance.  Good.  He'll come around. Ooooh.  Another Jewel getting new office furniture.  I'm jealous.  I just told dh this morning that my fall project is going to be redoing the master bath.  I'm going to see if we can afford a new shower stall setup with a better shower head, retile the shower stall and then have the room patched and painted.  Should keep me busy for a while.  Then in the spring I'm going to have the exterior trim painted and I'm setting the groundwork with dh to have the beds redefined and mulched in time for dd's graduation party.  I'd even like to replace some of the shrubs that have died off, leaving gaps in our landscaping.  I'm so excited to keep the house nice.  It's our one investment that isn't tanking right now (even in a shitty housing market, properties this close to DC are always in demand).  Oops, sorry Carol, I digressed from your new office furniture.  Do you still like me? And a new wine cooler?  How California of you.  You're becoming quite the aficionado, aren't you?  I don't think my dh will want me to visit SIS Kimberly if I come home all wrapped about the care and feeding of wine! Julie!  I'm with the family-stop giving so much homework!  ;) I don't envy you cleaning the \"playroom.\"  Those areas can get out of hand, can't they?  Ours never had a chance to get out of control as our lower level has flooded 3 times in 14 years.  I think we solved the problem last time (lots of caulk and a new French drain system), but every time we ended up pitching stuff, repainting and getting new carpeting.  It's the best looking level in the entire house!  Anyway, good luck for a quick sale at your asking price! Congrats to LJ!!!  So glad that, poof, the rads are all done!  It's funny how quickly you can put that experience out of your mind, isn't it?  I'm so happy that everyone took the time to acknowledge your last tx.  I was always one of the first at my rad center to cheer folks on as they finished.  And, yeah, I hear you on the realization that people are really caring.  Living in large metro areas, I think we sometimes lose sight of the goodness that lies beneath.  I'm really trying to take time to cultivate that goodness in myself and I hope this realization lasts. And I must admit, I'm trying really hard not to flip other drivers off!  I had a woman tailgate me on 270 last weekend and flash her lights and gesture madly, but I couldn't get out of her way as there were cars in front of me and in the next lane.  Instead of engaging in an off-flipping war, I just smiled at her in my rearview and shrugged and then turned up the radio and sang along.  Fuck road rage.  Continue your great journey. Oh, back to Carol for a minute.  Thanks for the encouragement on my le arm.  I need to report here that when I saw my legu on the 18th, she told me it was time to cut loose.  My arm has gone down 3.5cm and my torso even more.  Even though I still have that \"full/stiff\" feeling in my armpit, she couldn't justify more visits for my insurance.  She has ordered the MLD machine for me (good thing my insurance will cover this as the damn thing costs $10,000!), which will keep me in massage for the rest of my life (apparently I respond well to MLD).  I will see her monthly for a while and then only on an as-needed basis.  I have mixed feelings about this, but it's nice not to need 2x weekly appointments.  Now if I could only get my rotator cuff back on track.  I have p/t scheduled through October for that! Speaking of rotator cuff, how is your arm, LJ? Okay, I need to get dinner on the road. Onward through the fog, Jewels! D1",

      "Content": "Sep 9, 2008 06:59PM Determined1 wrote: WTF, you guys, I had to chase our thread down on page 2!!!!!  (Maybe that's a good thing...) So I met with my onc yesty.  It was pretty uneventful (except that I was there for more than 3 hours!).  Seems all the studies I'd signed up to do for Georgetown didn't make my blood draw orders and there was no way I was going to have more than one draw.  So we had to track down everyone and have the stuff added.  I hope they got what they needed.  One of the tubes I did was for BRCA testing, so we'll see... My onc was in to making me comfortable this time.  I told him I was hesitant to go with more rx, so he agreed to try some natural remedies first.  So I toddled off to the vitamin store today to buy some vit e and oil of primrose.  I take these 2x a day to combat the hot flashes.  You'll recall I was trying the black cohosh, but it didn't cut the mustard, so onward and upward.  I'm not wild about taking all of these supplements, but I really don't want to try the rx stuff.  He was also concerned that I don't sleep (hell, I haven't slept in 17 years-since dd was born.  That's the reason we only have 2 kids!).  Anyway, I'm supposed to try taking a Tylenol PM every night for a week and then see what happens.  If that doesn't get me at least 6 hours a night, then I have an rx for Ambien.  I hate this.  I probably won't take it, but we'll see.  I've gotten used to 3 hours then tossing and turning and then one more hour before I get up.  Maybe I'll be a better person if I sleep... So, what's up? KathyL-okay, so WTH on the nipple.  I like your attitude.  (Particularly since I know you're my needle phobic sister.) Oh, speaking of needles-big girl panties, Carol.  Are you reading this??? LJ-Lost the compost bin top?  Not bad.  Our electricity was cut off by someone's huge old maple falling up the street.  It was a shame to see the old tree go, but I was distressed by no electricity!  We didn't watch the Cancer show here.  It came on and I expressed some interest, but everyone said the only reason I wanted to watch it was because I'd had cancer (duh) and that if I hadn't, I wouldn't want to watch it.  Since they hadn't had cancer, we watched some other drivel.  I'm sorry I missed it.  Oh, and WTH, do the Komen.  It's one day out of your life and it's kinda reaffirming to realize that you are a survivor.  I sometimes lose sight of that in my little world.  You went through a lot, LJ, go out and celebrate the fact that you did it.  Take dp, too, she a survivor as well. Glad to see your post, Julie, how are your girls?  Last I heard, you over did.  Is everything okay?  I wish someone would pass a dick down to me... OMG, I almost spewed martini at the computer when I read that Carol replaced her tampons with a fan!!!  And the Hawks and Vikes suck, so we can commiserate through yet another sport season. Okay, then you want your ds to practice reading-are you trying to ruin my computer????  I think some vodka came out of my nose on that one. Oh, Kathy makes me want to weigh in on the generator.  Our power goes out a lot because our lines are above ground in a mature neighborhood (read that to say lots of old trees in a dense area).  We don't have a generator, but many of our neighbors do.  It's weird when the power goes out to hear the hum of all those generators.  I doubt we'll get one, too cheap. SIS Kimberly-I wish I had an interest in making wine.  I think I mentioned that we tried beer and it was good, but something that fell away when we had kids.  I really enjoy reading about your wine, so please keep us updated.  I really hope your classes work out.  I was talking to my sister last night (I'll share that next).  She's an elementary school librarian and is having all kinds of difficulty with her principal.  She's a librarian that doesn't want to just check out books.  She wants to do distance learning with out islands in the Bahamas (that's what I'm going to tell you about in a minute) and also with South Africa.  She's really amazing, and I don't just say that because she's my sister.  But her principal is a butt.  So I totally feel for you trying to get things sorted out.  Good teachers should be treated better. So, my sister.  Three years ago I went to one of the Bahamian out islands with her to work under her direction to set up some literacy centers.  She's incredible.  We did some library stuff, but she also did some modeling for the island teachers.  I helped some of the kids with internet research for the first time (thank goodness I'd done all that volunteering in the computer lab when my kids were in elementary school) and then we put together some presentations to share via internet with her school in Wisconsin.  Then, because I use PCs (she's a MAC girl), I was asked to set up the internet center in one of the towns with donated PCs.  It was hard, because when I fired up the computers, they all had passwords.  So I spent hours trying to crack those passwords.  Out of 5 machines, I got 3 opened up and loaded all kinds of software.  It was such a good feeling.  (Although there was a sand flea nest under the table they set up for the computers, so my legs swelled up from all the bites and I was a mess.) Anyway, long story short.  For Christmas last year I asked dh for a ticket to the Bahamas to help my sister again this year.  It looks like we'll be going the last week of October.  I wouldn't normally miss the end of an election cycle (I love politics, but I refrain here, not sure you'd all still like me), but this is totally worth it.  I hate the fucking bugs and sweaty, sandy conditions (I'm really a princess), but I feel really good about it.  And my hair is good for a trip to the Bahamas.  So there. Okay, complain time.  Why is my middle rounding?  I've always been thin and I work out a lot, but I see some roundness in photos.  What's up with that?????  That's me and the dh on vacation.  We're on the Bosphorus.  I know, now you really feel sorry for my roundness... D1",

Speaking of the Bahamas, both of my sisters are going now.  Hopefully many hands will make light work.  I think my one sis' recent scare has caused her to rethink some things in her life, so she's making more of an effort.  Heading to the Bahamas with her sisters to do some volunteer work is just the first effort.  I hope we get some \"down\" time to play a little.  My coordinating sis is painting an all work and no play picture at this point... Hey KathyL, sounds like your doc report went very well.  Now you just have to keep yourself on track.  Oh, and I'm sorry I was gloating about my last back to school night when you are all excited to be embarking on that adventure.  Trust me, with time you'll look forward to the END of those evenings, but for now, please enjoy-don't let my cynicism rain on your parade! So how's the ds' cold coming along, Carol?  My kids seem to be back to normal now after about 10 days of sniffling and griping.  (Well, the griping continues...)  I guess I need to look into flu shots about now... And then there's CathyCA taking her kid's cold on cation with her!  How maternal of you!  Hey, your panel sounds really cool.  I just got a flyer for one to be held here on Oct. 11 and I'm thinking about going and seeing if there's something I can do to help going forward.  My only issue is that's when college girl will be home for fall break and I'm loath to miss any excitement.  We'll see. So Paula's home safely.  Sounds like the rest of your conference went really well.  I'm glad my city treated you guys okay (you even got to experience some of our traffic-lucky you!).  Please, you're too kind (see, told you guys, Paula's just a really nice person).  I do agree that the time just flew by.  And as soon as I got home, I realized that I'd missed an opportunity to meet your ds.  What were we thinking???  HE could've taken our thug shots and got the hand signals in the frame... So when do you guys get your test results back?  I sometimes hate the way all my scans and whatnot works-\"no news is good news\" for me.  In all honesty, I'd even like to hear the good news! SIS Kimberly-I saw your testimonial for the Sutter folks.  You must be very pleased with how that came out (and I'm not just talking about the foobies!).  You look mahvelous in the photo, too.  Hope you're keeping your head above water these days (although the treading will be good for your weight loss program!).  Thinking about you. Oh fine, Carol, giving away my SP secrets!  I AM happy to hear your onc visit was uneventful.  It's so cool that we're all racking up these doc visits without bad news.  I'm loving this.  Oh, I tivo'd Grey's, too.  I really need to find some time to watch a bunch of this stuff cause I think I'm filling up my recording space (I've been tivoing Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Bill Maher-have to get my political fix!).  First, though, I need to go hop in my machine-I missed yesty with the visit to college girl. And I'm with you, Paula's spirit is totally amazing.  She's an example to us all. Onward! D1",

Still messing with my mom's computer situation.  Now she's having a crisis of confidence in Dell because the last puter she had was a Dell and it died after 2 ½ years.  So I'm waiting for her to decide what she wants to do.  (Do you hear my fingers drumming?) I went on a date last night with dh.  He took me out to dinner.  Dd headed off to the high school football game, so we weren't leaving her in the lurch.  It was nice (I splurged and got a crabcake-yummy).  I guess with the recession everyone is talking about coming soon, I'd better take advantage of being able to afford a dinner out now and then.  (For those keeping score, no action, just dinner.) I do have a new development to report in my recovery.  I've been complaining to the gal working on my rotator cuff that now, with my new range of motion, I notice my armpit burns every time I raise my arm above my shoulder.  She's thinking it may be the mess of scar tissue I have there (my surgeon didn't do a great job on the node surgery scar-in fact, he sewed me up a little kiddy-wampus and left me with armpit hair sticking out of my armpit.  Luckily, rads zapped that hair into the nether world, so that was one good thing!  But my scar tissue is kinda messed up under there.).  Anyhoo, she talked with my legu and they've decided to try some kind of silicone patch under there.  I'm supposed to wear it as much as I can for the next few weeks and see if my scar/scar tissue begins to soften.  I'm hopeful.  I'm fussing with it a little because it keeps getting dislodged by my big bra, but I'm thinking I'm going to figure out how to position it so it stays in place real soon.  I did wear it overnight and it was still there this morning, so that's good.  I'll keep you all posted. So Carol, did you guys eat any Mexican on your 3day?  Talk about cheesy, spicy glop!  One of my favorite cuisines.  Yummm.  Hope you guys had fun rehashing your experience and you got home in time for bed!  Magnetic bracelets?  Sounds like my silicone patch.  May as well give it a try.  It'll go with your necklace!!!  ;)  Oh, and you know my take-any time they cut in to my body I have to be asleep and will make a stink with my surgeons about it.  Voice your preferences-it's your body and your peace of mind. BTW, I thought about you all day yesty, knowing it was your cancerversary.  I'm so happy you're where you are right now and have put the last year behind you.  Congrats.  Keep on truckin'!  (Ohh, how appropriate for you!!!!) Oh my gosh, Paula, what great news from your trip to Duke.  A refreshed reading of your own scans and the doc report on dh-all good!  (Did they have any explanation for the long seizure?  Is it related to the shrinking tumors?) And hooray on the port removal!!  One more cancer-related thing behind you.  I'm so happy to hear your le report (do you have time to work and be a mom during all of this????).  Hopefully, your swelling will start going down soon and not interfere too much with your bra shopping. Hope your conference went well-how great that you get to spend the time with your ds. Therese!  Great to hear from you!  Sounds like your \u2018pink' celebration is going to be a big one this month.  Good for you.  Embrace the things that make you happy.  Who cares if others don't find the joy you do in things \u2018pink,' you have to make yourself happy.  So walk, lunch, tailgate, cheer, and hug your way through October.  You have certainly earned the right. (I started the process to get me one of those bc specialty license plates for my car yesterday.  I've reserved \"O FUBC\" as my personalized message-FUBC was already taken, imagine that!  Poser.  Anyway, I have to get an emissions inspection and then trot off to the courthouse to finish my order.  I hope to be done next week.  So, I guess I'm still in the pink, so to speak.) I'm so glad you're resolving the job thing, Sherry.  I'm sorry it was such a hassle for you, but when you get it all settled it will be worth it (and you'll forget what a pain it was-kinda like childbirth, or hell, CHEMO!)  The shutterfly thing sounds like a most amazing gift.  I'm sure you'll treasure it forever. Ah, you remind me-they finished the BRCA tests on the rest of my strand and it all came back negative (the first part they did was on the \"Jewish\" stuff as that's a high risk factor, but they then took it back and checked out the whole thing).  The gal said there could be a genetic connection because of my mom's thyroid cancer, but when we talked about it, we decided to stop testing.  It's not that important to me.  So I guess my cancer, like most people's, was just my UNluck of the draw. Julie-Sorry about the hassle on the post (hope that doesn't happen to me), but what GREAT NEWS about you and PALady!!!!!  I'm SOOOO excited for you guys!  You won't believe how good the in-person hugs feel.  Getting one from a Jewel is such a major treat (I mean, we've been cyber hugging for the past 9 months when we all really needed hugs and to get a real one-oh, I can't put it in words).  Anyway, give an extra squeeze for me!  Can't wait to see the pictures! Oh, Carol, what sad news about your friend.  It's hard to believe she was on the sidelines as a supporter and now she's going to be a survivor.  Yes, send her to this site.  I agree that we were lucky, but I'll bet others feel equally as lucky on other threads.  There's something connecting about weathering such a difficult experience together.  I hope she finds the support and laughs we all need on this journey. Hmmm.  I need more coffee.  The dh just cleared my plate from which I ate the coffeecake he whipped up this morning, but now I need a drink.  (Speaking of needing a drink-have any of you REALLY listened to Sarah Palin??  A heartbeat away.  OMG.)  Oops.  I'm supposed to stay away from politics.  Just vote, everyone.  It's so important. Okay, coffee. D1",

Therese, our graveyard is really cool.  Fifteen years ago I bought a sheet of plywood and borrowed a jigsaw to make some gravestones.  Then I painted them all gray (I can't remember the type of paint I bought, but it holds up well to rain), and then used black paint to inscribe them with some \"names.\"  The \"dead\" include Yuri Goner, Anita Coffen, C.U. Laytor, Helen Gaun, Seth M. Free, and I.M. Cursed.  There are a couple of others, but I can't remember them right now.  Then I nailed the plywood to some yard stakes.  Every year I have to renail the markers to the stakes, but other than that, they've held up well.  The whole neighborhood looks forward to our graveyard.  I also hang some bats from the trees overhead to add to the scene.  It's fun. Hope your Komen race went well. Paula, can't wait for you to get your help at school.  You work too hard, girl!  My homecoming was more like yours.   Dd had a good time, though, so I guess it's all good.  Latest word from college girl is that she lost her keys, to which she'd attached a thing that held her id, driver's license, bank card, a few bucks, etc.  She's now scrambling to replace everything/stop her bank card.  Man, life's a bitch, isn't it? I just bought the latest Alice Sebold book for my trip (have to use my new bookmark and light from my SP!).  I read \"The Lovely Bones\" and really liked it, so I'm hoping for more of the same. Oh yeah, Carol, you had the crab!  I'm hoping for some crawfish (most people call them lobster) and shrimp while on Eleuthera.  I'm in charge of dinner one night and I'm taking the makings for a chicken curry dish.  I'm hoping they don't confiscate my spices at customs.  If they do, I'll just be grilling chicken and hoping for lots of Kalik (the local brew).  One of my sisters is promising some seafood, so hopefully it'll be something I'm craving... Sherry, the medal is good, but the hair is GREAT.  I'm glad you did the walk-no one can take that experience away from you.  Hang in with the job training.  You'll be awesome. Carla-a MAN with fish in his platforms!!!!  You guys are crazy in WV!!! BC.org has some advertising, Carol?  I've never seen any.  How cool is that?! So, SIS Kimberly, what is the bible of Italian cooking?  I like to prepare Italian (particularly pasta dishes). What's the twinsis going to do, Kimberly?  Glad she's headed to Sutter.  Those folks seem to have done good by you.  Is Kathleen going the lump or mast route?  I know with your family history, it must weigh in her decision.  All our Jewce is headed her way! CHJ, great pix!  I see you're in pink!  Sounds like a real crowd at your event. Carol,  sounds like ds had a typical homecoming experience.  I'm glad he rose above the shit high school kids pile on each other and had a good time anyway.  This will be one of the stories he tells his own kids someday (God knows my girls are tired of mine-and particularly those of the dh!) Oh, yeah, scallops and prosciutto, sounds good to me.  What cookbook is that?  Are there pictures?  I need a picture so I know what my food is supposed to look like when I'm done mangling it.  The Seahawks and the Vikings suck. Julie, good to hear some news from you.  I'm sorry the house thing is more difficult than you expected.  (LOL at the \"step-monster.\").  It's such a sucky time to be in the market.  I wish all good things for you guys.    Oh, and I'll be pulling for \"Vendor #2\"!  Break a leg!  (I had more of those parts than I can count!-And I was still an honor Thespian, so tell ds to take heart.) Hmmm.  Dd is trying to tell me about talent night at her school.  I want to pay attention to her.  I'm suddenly realizing that she'll be gone in 9 months...  (Or at least I hope so!) Later, Jewels.

We worked in a tiny public library Mon/Tues and categorized 100's of books, made envelopes for the circ cards, and made circ cards. It looked great when we left.  My librarian sis helped the librarian that \"works\" there learn the ropes of tracking circ and making the library more fun.  She even set up a bunch of educational websites on the desktops of the computers, so the kids just have to click on them for homework help.  Every night when we go home we mix up some island drinks and pop a movie in the dvd player and doze off.  This morning my librarian sis went to the next library on her own to check things out (as it were) and then came home to get us.  We drove 45 minutes to a town with a laundromat to do our laundry and now we're in that town's library.  We're hoping to score some fresh seafood to make for dinner tonight (we've been getting off work too late at night and the boys with the fish are gone from the docks).  No time in the sun, yet, although my non librarian sis and I did manage to snorkle for about an hour one morning.  It was good. Tomorrow back to the \"stacks\" (library joke).  We're hoping we can finish tomorrow and have Friday off.  Yay!!! Oops, the kids are off from school and are coming in to the library, so I have to get off the computer.  Till next time... D1",

Damn, LJ, you know your audio shit.  I'm impressed.  I need you to be closer by when I'm in the market. I love your attitude about your students' grades for the next marking period, SISKimberly.  It reminds me of the \"innocent until proven guilty\" thing.  I hope they start to see the light this trimester.  And I don't see anything wrong with rewards.  Sometimes they add the extra incentive we all need. So I see Kathleen is getting her PET scan today.  Hopefully, it will help her team better define what they're going to do during her surgery on the 4th.  What surgery did she decide to do?  (Sorry if I missed it.) Doggoneit, Carol, I wish I'd just called.  I know my crew gets their bowels in an uproar (is that an okay expression to use around you, now?) when I disappear in to the phone, so I try to be sensitive about that.  The darn time difference makes it tough. Congrats on your cancerversary, Kris!  Thank God it's been a year!!!!! WTF, Carla?!  How did that make it past the thought police???  I tried arguing that mine stood for \"Friends United By Cancer,\" but the gal on the phone didn't buy it.  Hey, I saw that you guys were getting some snow-drive carefully. You too, Paula, you're probably seeing some white stuff, too.  I'm sending my very best vibes to you and Ed.  Please take care. CathyCA-waiting for the results of your 3day...

      "Content": "Dec 13, 2008 09:37AM Determined1 wrote: So that Megace hit me pretty hard.  I took my first one Thursday night at about 10p and toddled off to bed.  I awoke at 4am to a heart racing so hard I was breathless.  I laid in bed and did every mind control trick I knew to slow it down.  Scary as shit.  Anyway, then I start having this mother of a hot flash.  Sweat dripping down my sides, neck, soaking the sheets.  As soon as that abated (heart is still racing, but not as scary), I realize I'm mega thirsty, so I decide to head to the bathroom for a drink.  As soon as I stood up, the room went black and I was \"this close\" to passing out.  Eventually got the drink and got back in to bed.  Then I tried to chill out, lower my heart rate, and get back to sleep-which I did after a couple of hours.  So, I called my onc yesterday to report.  Funny, sometimes he's so hard to reach, but his nurse had him on the horn in minutes when I talked about the racing heart.  He said that is not a side effect for Megace, but that didn't mean it wouldn't cause it in me.  He was hesitant to put me in danger's way, but he wanted me to try taking the drug in the morning (this morning-which I have done) and monitor my reaction during the day.  Get this, if my heart races again and I have pain, I'm to high-tail it to an ER.  He thinks since the drug is an appetite stimulant (that's the gain weight part), that it may have a stimulation effect to me that I could possibly handle during my waking hours.  I feel like a walking test lab. Other than that, I'm filling my time with the anxiety of the holidays, like everyone else!  I really need to get on my shopping-that always makes me feel better.  I think we're getting our tree today to decorate tomorrow (a real tree for me-I grew up in a house of people with allergies to trees and didn't get a real tree till I was an adult).  That always makes me happy, but then there's that empty space underneath it that needs to be filled... Carol-I have teeny veins, too.  They have to use the IVs for small children on me (I really hate it when I tell them that and then they try to stick an adult IV in there and fail).  Perhaps you could try requesting the smallest set up they have.  I find I'm getting more demanding with these needle-bearing people-I'm realizing I have enough experience to know what will work (now that's pathetic).  Let us know what they say about your reports. So sorry to hear about Steph.  You describe his courage so poignantly.  I'll continue to keep him in my thoughts. Keep that SUV shiny side up (lol). AZDonna!  Great to hear from you.  I'm going to jump on the bandwagon started by LJ and KathyL and say get your nodules checked nine ways to Sunday, but try to keep your freak out level low.  I think false positives are going to be the bane of our existence now-and I'm hoping that's all you have.  You're encouraging me to follow up and be a big girl and get my CT scan to doublecheck a mass in my lungs (I've been keeping my head in the sand over it because, quite frankly, I don't want to know, but your bravery makes me want to suck it up).  Please let us know the report. Hey Julie-happy cancerversary!!!!!  Sorry the rest of us are so lame that we don't know how to include those moving pictures in our posts, but I'm happy to see you doing your own happy dance! I guess there's one thing I don't miss about younger kids, KathyL, and that's how many illnesses they so generously share with their parents!  Hope you're feeling better soon. Your cruise sounds great, CathyCA.  I hope you have fabulous weather.  Feel the sun shine on your face and be happy. Paula, Paula, Paula.  Can you PLEASE catch a break?  I will say between scar tissue and leftover (lame-o) lymph nodes in my left axilla, I have quite a bit of constant pain.  Everything is really hard under there and I've been told the farther away from rads I get, the more softening I can expect.  I'm hopeful that will mean the pain will subside, too.  Good news is that the hard wad is ping pong ball sized now and last Spring it was like a baseball and I couldn't rest my arm by my side.  So maybe that's all you have.  Try not to get too anxious this weekend-there isn't anything you can do about it till you get the news from your med team (that is SO easy to say, isn't it???). Yeah, I'm perpetually weepy, too.  Just yesterday I had a 10 minute drive and found myself with tears streaming down my face twice.  Once was because I was thinking about how much dd wants to go to Vassar and we find out on Monday if she gets in.  And the other was over some stupid bumper sticker that got to me.  I'm a mess.  I'm hoping the Megace works better today. You're lucky your guide wire wasn't too unpleasant, PALady.  I had all that numbing, too, but once they got the sucker in to my boob I could feel every millimeter of movement as it traveled through my poor baby and was completely and totally freaked out.  It really was the worst experience for me.  I will not EVER do it again without a general.  Let the techs deal with my limp body in the MRI machine! Yeah, we're laughing around here about the weight gain/depression thing.  To me, nothing will depress me more than putting on any more weight, but we'll see.  Dh promises to continue to love me even if I get chunky-this from a guy currently wearing braces to straighten his teeth and undergoing treatments to remove/reduce acne scar tissue that has bothered him since his teens (he's already whitened his teeth).  In my teary moments I really lash out at him over how he's making improvements to his body and I'm deteriorating (scars, half a boob, le, shall I go on?).  It always makes for interesting drama around the house (hello Megace!). Wow, you have a lot of research and decisions to make, don't you?  It's so funny to me how they treat us all so differently based on age.  It comes up all the time in my appointments, too.  It always makes me feel old since I'm over that 50 year old threshold.  I don't feel 50... Anyway, good luck with your choices, I know you'll do the right thing for you. My new SP sent me an iTunes gift card-WoooHooo!  Right up my alley.  I've already been wandering around the iTunes store scoping out the music I MUST have!  Thanks, SP!!! Okay, off to pay attention to my heart.  I'll let you know how it goes. D1",

Want to comment on Julie's before and after photos:  Girl, you did a fabo job!!!  You completely transformed your space.  I think you should be featured on one of those decorating shows!  We did finally have a couple of contractors come by to look at our bathroom.  The first estimate came in at $6K!  It looks like we have to completely retile just to repair the shower floor because of the way it was tiled in the first place.  The second contractor even wants to demolish the base under the shower stall and start over-that sounds like even more money!  I'll see how much he'll charge, but I'm tempted to go with the first guy-we both liked him and, hey, he's originally from Michigan, too! Oh, and the basement looks like a big job.  I really want to know what you're going to do with that kid in the background... I'm so glad that some of you guys got to see the inauguration.  I didn't find the speech particularly moving, but the event sure was! Carla, great news on the pow-wow with your dh (noticed you even used lower case!).  Hopefully, by opening lines of communication you can begin to reconcile your feelings. Patty, I think we need to send some feelers out to some of the resorts in Vegas.  I should probably read through the thread, because you are probably all on that by now, but that's where I'd start.  I know you have a connection at Planet Hollywood, so that makes sense to start there.  I also want to look at a place with one of those lazy river thingys for the poolside group among us (it sounds like we may outnumber the gamblers!).  I think Mirage and MGM (but that's at one end of the strip and I'd rather be in the middle, if we can) have one.  Do you know of others that we should look at? Just read SISKimberly's homework assignment-I like it! Oh Paula.  I'm so sorry to hear you're blue.  Of course, with everything you're doing, I would think it would be a natural se.  It must be so hard to juggle dh, tx, kids, work, home, your own feelings...  ((((((HUGS)))))  I did think of you when Kennedy had the seizure during the luncheon after the swearing-in.  I told all the folks who were with me at the time what I'd learned from you about this type of cancer.  Just seeing how upset everyone was over Kennedy's seizure gave me a little better insight into what happens at your house when there's a seizure.  I sure hope this new tx does the trick... Yay!!  Deb's coming to Vegas!!! Look at the list that's coming!  I never dreamed so many of us would be able to do a Jewel Junkett (I know, there I go again with my corny alliteration).  I am so looking forward to this! I'm with you, Norma, the Izzy story line is crazy (really).  It kinda sounds like it might be wrapping up soon-at least we can hope so. Interesting observation about your blues, Paula.  It certainly sounds plausible to me. Finally, Kris, the draining slows!  Hooray!  LOL at the tp-ing! Not fair, Wendy, practicing up for Vegas!  There is NO WAY I'll see 2am!!! Sounds like your dh is being smart, Julie.  I'm sorry he has to go to so much trouble to do his job, but sometimes our leaders put us in that position.  Rant any ol' time. What, Patty???  You're not dreaming about me????  It would most def keep you up at night if you were!  Oooh.  Just read your dream-totally makes sense to have that one on your chemo anniversary.  That IS a nightmare! Hooray Tina!!!  Your house moved really quickly!  You guys must be excited about that.  Hopefully the inspection won't turn up any surprises and you'll be on your way! Loved your post, SISKim.  The picture sounds amazing.  My college girl is into photography, and we have many of her b/w prints framed around the house.  Photography truly is an art form. Deb, I think the trip to Vegas is just what the doc should order for you (in fact, can you get a script for that and get your health insurance to cover it??).  I liked what SISKim had to say about Mandalay Bay-I'm going to take a gander at that when I'm done with my post.  BTW, LOVE the new signature! Wow, Carol!  That was a long one for you.  Glad to hear you're getting something crossed off the honey-do list.  I always like that (like today getting my webcam!). Okay, gang, here's a question.  Do we need to find another avenue for planning our Vegas trip than on the Boards?  Should we all get on facebook, maybe?  (Oh, I have to go there today, too.)  Just throwing it out there.

It's interesting to me that most of you say any tumors over 1cm get chemo automatically.  I'm way over that at 1.8 (and maybe growing with the next lumpectomy), and yet, my doc considers me a chemo question mark.  Is that because of my age (I don't feel old!)?  Or that I'm post-menopausal (and gaining weight by the minute as a result)?  Curious as to what your read might be. Also, my doc hasn't talked too much about Tamoxifen or some of the other meds you all mention.  How do those drugs compare in effectiveness to chemo?  Or are they something you take after chemo?  I haven't researched the whole chemo and afterwards part of this yet, as I find I manage best taking it a step at a time (it can be so overwhelming). Any light is most appreciated. D1",
