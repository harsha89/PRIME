      "Content": "savvy107 wrote: Hello all,  I just figured I would try and post here to hopefully receive some feedback to calm my nerves a bit.  I'm 20 years old, and had discovered a small marble sized, hard lump in my left breast right under the areola of my nipple.   It seems to move around and be smooth edged, so it seems as though this is a good sign as far as not being cancerous.  I went to get an exam, and my doctor scared me by saying she felt the mass deeper into my breast.  She also told me I have fibrocystic breasts.  Finally, she found a second lump, lower in my breast, that feels quite large to me, however I cannot even really point it out when I examine myself, as it just feels similar to all of the other lumpy tissue in my breast.  The lumps both generally painless, however my boobs have been incredibly swollen and slightly tender.  My mensis also just began, so I'm not sure whether to account the swelling from that, or the lumps.   I'm going for an ultrasound friday, but I can't lie, I'm quite scared and anxious about the whole thing.  I almost wish the lumps were sore, and squishier, so I could be better able to believe they're just cysts.  I keep trying to remind myself that chances are slim that I could have cancer so young, but it isn't entirely impossible.  My grandmother's mother had breast cancer, but that is the only person as far as i know in my family.   I'm feeling really anxious, and I suppose I just need some advice and support to calm down and be more level headed about this.  Thank you for taking the time to read. =)  Log in to post a reply",
