About six months before I officially felt something I thought I felt something during my self exam but it felt somewhat similar to the right side so I let it go. Fast forward six months and I had lost almost 30 pounds and was down a bra size and whoop! there it is. It felt...wrong. It's painless, solid, and it feels rooted into my breast like tree roots. It's really irregular too. From the left side of it it's deep and the edges almost feel finger-like but the right side of it comes almost to a wedge and is fairly smooth. I knew the instant I felt it that this wasn't going to end up the way I wanted it to. I don't know of any family history of BC. I'm still undecided on whether or not I want to do genetic testing though it is advised since I just turned 34.",

We have about 20lb of potatoes at home right now because I kept buying a new bag of them on my way home because I was convinced I had forgotten to get them when I was grocery shopping and repeated that for 4 days. I keep receiving packages in the mail of things I've ordered that I forgot about so every day is like Christmas lol. We now have enough food storage containers to last until the apocalypse. My whole life is a series of half done tasks - laundry in the wash that doesn't make it to the dryer, filled a trash bag of junk in my car but keep forgetting to run it to the dumpster, return labels for my surprise online orders printed but keep forgetting to take the boxes to the post office. I'm doing ok so far at work - I've made a few critical errors and was left scrambling to cover myself but for the most part my coping strategies are getting me through the workday. I have to write down ever single thing I do or need to do. At home I'm a chemo brain mess but it's mostly something I can laugh about and get through with good humor. My husband is kinda loving it because pre chemo me never forgot a single thing ever. I was the worst person to get in an argument with. I'm learning to give up control a little bit. Pre chemo me had to have everything done in a very exact and specific way and now I just don't care. I don't have the attention span for it.",

For the last biopsy on my left breast the radiologist did let me know that the marker had migrated away from where they had meant it to be when they checked its placement on mammogram and that it might be palpable from the outside but she didn't think it would cause me any trouble. Two days later the marker they used worked its way out of the puncture wound from the biopsy. From discussing with the radiologist and BS it isn't unheard of to be able to feel the markers, especially if the site biopsied was closer to the skin. The working its way out of the wound issue isn't really something people have to worry about, I think mine was just exceptionally unusual.",

I had a flare reaction during the infusion and they loaded me up with so many steroids and benadryl so they could finish the infusion I could barely say my own name at the end of it.I'm going to have to speak with my MO about the nausea meds and come up with a better plan. The side effects of the nausea meds are worse than the chemo I think but I'm terrified of being that overwhelmingly nauseous without them. The weirdest part for me is how quickly my scalp feels all prickly and itchy. Its been this way since the morning after my infusion and it's maddening! I can totally see why people shave their head for comfort. I only took a half a compazine today after waking up with a lot of nausea but the completely out of it, space cadet feeling I get with that med (along with the headache it gives me) knocked me out for most of the day. Believe it or not the zofran and emend make me feel even worse. I don't feel nearly as bad as I was worried I would, I just feel bad faster than I thought I would. My husband, bless his heart, just walks around after me carrying cups of water and telling me to drink.",
