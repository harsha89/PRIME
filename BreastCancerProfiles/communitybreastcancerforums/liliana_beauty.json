I found a mass on my left breast and my fiance had me go see a doctor. The doctor sent me to get an ultrasound done but when I went the tech that did the ultrasound told me that a lot of young girls go see her just \"because your boobs hurt.\" I informed her that I had clogged ducts while breastfeeding several yrs. ago and that this was much worse. Is there anyone who has any advise to give me? The doctor does not seem to be worried but they are still very painful and they get bruises on them from just wearing a bra. The doctor just told me no caffeine and chocolate that it should go away, so I quit drinking and eating chocolate and caffeine and my breasts are still very painful. PLEASE any advise will be greatly appreciated. I am not pregnant. Log in to post a reply",
