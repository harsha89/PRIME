I will say that I do continue to worry about the way the whole \"foob\" looks, in that it stil has that scab, albeit getting smaller, and, to me, seems pretty red where the new skin is showing.  But, as I said, the PS has seen it this past Monday, he seems okay with it, so I'm trying not to stress too much (much easier said than done!). In terms of daily activities, I have been careful not to bounce around at all, because for some reason I'm scared that will mess up the incision.  I know some people run and hike and do all sorts of regular athletic activities when they've got an expander in place, but I've stuck to the treadmill and elliptical.  Whether that's kept the incision from getting any worse, I have no idea. Oh, and in answer to your question, yes, the skin gets soft after the shower, and then it hardens up.  I do think that's perfectly normal, just like a similar scab would be on your knee, for example. ",

Throughout all of this, the PS has continued his fills, for the most part.  I did keep asking him before each fill whether the incision would just burst and the expander come flying out (I think he thought I was crazy, but it sure seemed possible to me!), but, so far, it's still in there.  I'm not sure if it makes a difference that I'm keeping the mound small in the first place.  I started with 60cc at the time of surgery and am now at 300cc, which is all I really want.  I see the PS again in mid-February for a final look before March exchange, so we'll see what happens.  As I said before, it sure isn't pretty looking, but I guess it could be a lot worse.  I have a lot of confidence in the PS (he's at Sloan Kettering), so I'm just going with what he says.",

But, this thread appeared on the list of active topics, and I read it, and I have to say that it's important to understand that some boards on here can feel as if you're living in an alternate universe.  I'm talking about the topsy turvy world where coffee enemas, potatoes and furniture solvent cure cancer.  I suppose some people in that world, the early BC world, cling so tightly onto those odd ideas and opinions because they feel they need to.  They have such a vested interest in claiming to know exactly what caused their cancer, and exactly what is going to cure it and cause it never to come back again, simply because they're scared out of their minds.  There have been many posts on those forums that try to provide a balancing view, or, heaven forbid, a negative reaction to these \"cures,\" but they're quickly batted away.  Particularly strident posters on that forum (for some reason, it seems to be taken over recently by a couple of very stubborn, determinedly head-in-the-sand people) just ban anyone that doesn't subscribe to their way of looking at the world. I am so sorry these ignorant posts have hurt you, I can see how they would.  There are many, many people who care about you and about everyone on the Stage IV forum.  Don't let anyone with foolhardy ideas on this complex beast of cancer bring you down. Take care. ",

I think it is highly unlikely that the chest wall is cancerous, I think that you and I just happen to have skin that doesn't heal too well.  It's just the luck of the draw, and we drew the short straw.  I would just keep bugging your surgeons.  I'm sorry that's all I can offer you, but I do feel for you and wish you well and many hugs.  Hang in there. ",

So, I guess while it's obviously such a personal decision, I'm thinking that those of us with smaller boobs to begin with might have an easier time with reconstruction?  As an aside, the husband of a good friend of mine told her, when he found out I had breast cancer, that he didn't even think someone with such small boobs as mine could get breast cancer...ignorant, uh? ",
