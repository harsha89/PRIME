I have been debating on whether I'm even going to have radiation. I had a lumpectomy and one lymp node was removed, which was clean. However I have read some things and I'm not sure I want to go through with all the \"after\"surgery preventive care. Does radiation really help that much in the long run? Can someone please tell me if I'm being too paranoid?  Thank you",
