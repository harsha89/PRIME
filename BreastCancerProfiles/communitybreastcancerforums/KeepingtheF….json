I talked to my surgeon who convinced me that I needed to have the re-excision. He said the first surgery looked okay at the time, but sometimes under the microscope the margins aren't as good as they need to be. I had the re-excision and port placement at the same time. I really haven't noticed any difference since the surgery. Of course, my breast was sore all over again, but it is healing nicely and I can feel no SE from him cutting into the chest wall. I did get a new oncologist though, not because of this, but because I wasn't comfortable with the way the first one examined me. My husband was very uncomfortable with the first one. I hope you are all doing okay. Deb",

I met my new oncologist today and I like him much better than the first one. When he did his exam it was much more professional and didn't feel weird like the other one. I hope everyone is doing well. I am pretty much okay. I am not looking forward to starting chemo on Thursday and all the SE that it might involve, but I know the sooner it starts, the sooner it will be over. The port site is still quite tender. It doesn't hurt except when pressure is put on it, like if I hold a grandchild and they lay their head there, then it hurts. Is this par for the course and is it always going to be sensitive like this. I also have to be careful if I lay on that side, or if dh lays his arm across it when we are in bed. I am preparing to start my scripts today and my guzzling of lots of water. I am afraid to take any medicine unless I ask my onc. I read that alot of you use Claritin, and other meds to combat the SE, but I am afraid to do it. If the SE's get bad I will ask if I can. Glad to hear so many of you are doing okay and for those of you who are having alot of SE's I feel bad for you. I have not done anything with my hair yet. I can't decide what to do. I have pretty much always had quite long hair and it will be quite a change to lose it. I usually wear my waist-length hair up in a ponytail which I braid. I thought about cutting off the braid and then shaving, but I am torn. Part of me wants to keep it till the last minute and part of me wants to cut the braid while it is still good and either give it to hubby (who is quite attached to my hair) or donate it to locks of love. I guess I will somehow know when it is time. good luck and gentle hugs to you all. DebL",

Stlcardsfan--If I remember right I was told by my tubing went under my collarbone. Rachel--At risk of sounding stupid, what is MAC? Kimmie--Sorry to hear you weren't getting good response elsewhere. This is a great group and you will get plenty of feedback here. Welcome to the group too. Ginger--Loved reading your thoughts on hair.  thanks. JSW--Hope your 2nd start attempt went well. YoungMom--at $50 a tube, I think I will be passing on the Brian Josephs lash and brow...lol. Wherria--I have a friend who is kind of like that. I can be in the middle of telling her something I am going thru and she will interupt me to tell me about her problems. Sometimes she will realize it later and ask me what I was saying and sometimes not. I have just learned that is how she is and I overlook it, even though it really hurts my feelings sometimes. I also have friends that are very tuned in and always there for me, and guess who I turn to when I really need support. I am sorry your friend was so insensitive, but I am sure it is just how she is and she doesn't mean to be like that. And you have us, we will never make light of what you are going thru. Hugs. Lizzy--I hope the spots on your skull on the bone scan turn out to be nothing serious. I will be praying for a good outcome for you. Thanks to all who wished me well on my first chemo. Your well wishes, prayers, thoughts and whatever else you may have sent my way must have helped. My first chemo went off without a hitch. No real side effects afterward and nothing bad during the chemo. She did have to stick me twice because my surgeon put my port a bit deeper than usual and so when she put the first needle in it wouldn't reach so she had to get a longer needle. Used the lidocaine cream though and felt no pain. Had Neulasta shot today. It was no big deal either except now I am having some back pain (don't know for sure if it is a SE or just regular backache) so i am going to take some med for pain. Also getting a slight headache. I have been drinking water water water and think it is probably helping. Hugs to all time for a pill and bed.   Deb",

I have no lymph node involvement and will begin chemo on Aug 26th. I will be doing Taxotere and cytoxan. Got my port on Aug 10th and although I have no pain there most of the time, if any pressure is put on the area it really hurts. I also have to watch how I lay. I will have 6 rounds of chemo, 3 weeks apart, then a two weeks rest, followed by 6 weeks of radiation. Good luck to you. I hope everything is going well for you and everyone else. I still haven't caught up on the past posts so will add more as I read and as I am able to. We are going to get through this. Deb",

I am 57 myself. sohardbnme  I feel so bad for you and your heavy bleeding. I hope it gets better soon. wherria  I am so sorry for your loss of your beloved Bixby. My little dog Precious died this past November and I still miss her so much. The photo of Bixby reminds me a little of her. She had long black and white fur too that hung in her eyes if I didn't keep it trimmed. She was a rescue dog. Showed up at my daughters in the middle of a horrible snowstorm when just a little puppy and though we tried to find an owner, we never could, so I adopted her. On me,  I am having a bad day today. I really wanted to do something fun today, since I start chemo next Thursday and I don't know how I will feel. Just told hubby I wanted to do something fun. Really wanted HIM to come up with something but he wouldn't suggest anything and then when I did he just said \"whatever you want to do\"  or \"if thats what you want to do\", which made me feel like he didn't want to but was just going along with it. I mean, really, if I DIDN'T want to would I have suggested it. Anyway, I ended up getting all cranky then and just came home and did nothing. I think the stress is making me grouchy. Geez, I want this all to be over....I know you all feel the same. Thanks for listening Chemo-sabi's.... <that makes me grin>  Love, Deb",

On the same day I had first chemo we took temp custody of 4 grandchildren, so needless to say I have been busy between kids and SE. The first few days after chemo was no big deal, then gradually the SE started. I know its going to get alot worse. Mostly, its the bone pain from the neulasta shot. Also some abdominal pain, I think probably from bowel issues, although I am being very careful to not get constipated. I will try to give more information later. I am way behind on reading posts too, which I hope to get a chance to catch up on. Deb",

And for everyone here, wishes for good treatments with few side effects. Sorry I haven't posted, its just been so busy, but I have been at least trying to read all your posts. I will have my second chemo treatment on Thursday September 16th, and I am looking forward to getting another treatment out of the way. As far as the discussion on when we all first felt side effects, I had no problems day of the first treatment or for a couple of days after. Then I started noticing some beginnings of constipation so I took the Senokot S for a couple of nights, till things got going again. Don't know if I really needed it yet or not, but I was scared to get severe constipation so I took measures to prevent it. I have heard of people on chemo getting impacted and even being hospitalized. I also had some headaches, and was very tired for a few days. The neulasta shot caused me some bone pain also for a few days. The Wednesday after my Thursday chemo was the worst for me, but that may be because I didn't take any pain meds because I had my 4 yo granddaughter here and the pain meds make me sleep and since I was here alone with her I didn't want to take a chance on falling asleep. About 8 days after first chemo my SE began to go away and I have pretty much felt okay since then. Oh, I almost forgot, I did have one other side effect. My hair began to fall out last Tuesday and by Thursday it was coming out by the handfuls. I had pretty thick hair, but even so, with the amount of hair in my trash can I was amazed there was any left on my head. On Friday I decided it was time to take it all off (I'm just not into the mangy dog look....lol) so I called my good friend and asked her if she would buzz it off for me. She agreed and I let the grandkids take the scissors to it first. My hair was down to my butt when it wasn't put up (I usually wore it in a ponytail which I then braided). My friend buzzed it for me and so now I have joined the baldies. Now, I am busy crocheting hats to wear. Bought a couple cheap hats and a scarf and I am on my second crocheted one. Also sent for the free head covering but haven't gotten it yet. DebL",
