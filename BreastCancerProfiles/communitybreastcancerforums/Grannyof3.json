The end of October my mo switched me to Kadcycla. I too saw that video and was quite worried. However, after my second infusion, my tumor markers finally dropped. It was great to get some good news before the holidays. I'll get my next scans the first of the year, so I'm hoping all will be good. I hope you have a good response from Kadcycla. Merry Christmas/ Happy Holidays to All",
