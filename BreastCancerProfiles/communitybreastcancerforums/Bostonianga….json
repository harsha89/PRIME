I wonder if you would get chemo-first time- maybe the outcome would be better? If you would get second time hormone positive- I would blame it for not taking g tamoxifen, but 3 negative- is different thing! I wish you speedy recovery !!! Other ladies- get heal faster and I will take picture of my exercise but they better 3-4 weeks after surgery!",

So I posted a topic in Chemo : before during and after. Seeking for a good product. I find some info about black cohosh essential gel - it\u2019s went for a research among oncologists scientists - I think it\u2019s better than other thing but it is pricey-90$ per 1 jar . I heard Latisse is good. I think on TC regimen we may loose brow and lashes after- so ask your oncologist, I will plan too Google black cohosh for chemo treatment Are you planning to use cold cups for preserving your hair- I start using Paxman caps. Please check August chemo 2018 thread - we are there there 2 threads started by 2 members. I m posting in thread where more posts- welcome there",

I think If you have surgery first- it takes month to schedule it, especially if it\u2019s big hospital , I ve been diagnosed at the end of May and schedule my mastectomy on july3, but if I choose Boston hospital I would go on July 16 for surgery there. Then. Chemo started on August 8 . Go ahead and have fun , if they decide Chemo first - you can start it after vacay!! Feel free to pm if you have questions!! Smooth sailing...",
