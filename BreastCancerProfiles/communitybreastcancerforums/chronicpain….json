Meanwhile, consider securing some anxiety control medications from your primary care doctor, if no contraindications.",

I am very afraid of worsening of my chronic pain: I had two years of extreme and severe RSD of my hand years ago after a finger surgery post-trauma, requiring multiple nerve stellate ganglion blocks and aggressive PT and meds, but it did get better. Then the RSD came back in my foot after a bad sprain, lasted a year. Both RSD areas periodically flare with stress, overuse or cold weather, but have been manageable. I have extensively researched as best I can (as doctors know little, they are too busy focussing on doing their unique set of procedures and surgeons do not understand RSD any better than primary care docs ) what if anything can be done to lower the risk of RSD flares after breast surgery, and the radiation therapy that I will likely also need (or at least which will be strongly recommended), but there is little anyone knows because the disease is uncommon and not well-studied, i.e., there are just anecdotes and there is not much evidence-based medicine. The anesthesiologist assigned to me is not doing any special preparations, does not appear to know much, or care to learn more, and he is supposedly one of the better ones (did not even want to talk to me on the phone, much less see me to discuss). I am a health professional, so I did my own research, and I found some evidence that vitamin C 1 gm/day and magnesium supplements can help lower RSD flares in relation to surgery and radiation from breast CA, and they are pretty benign so I am taking those, but mostly it is just not studied and I am not expecting miracles On top of my RSD I have had polymyalgia rheumatica, which burned out into severe diffuse fibromyalgia after several years of assorted treatments including steroids, and had been doing ok coping and working full-time on a modified regimen with my chronic RSD, PMR, and FM pain for several years when the breast cancer was found. Here we go again, more risks for pain flares.  In your case, you need your pain controlled ASAP. If it is RSD flaring, (it can flare in other places if you ever had it before, sounds like that is happening) get a referral to a trained pain management specialist ASAP (pay out of pocket, on your credit card if your insurance plan does not cover it) and she can consider treatment with gabapentin, lyrica and other agents, even could use nerve blocks, depending on your condition, or even low dose narcotics to ease your suffering (despite the national crusade against narcotics, they are a godsend for people like us with chronic pain), otherwise there can be a positive feedback loop that worsens pain. You need to have movement to get RSD better, and people are hesitant to move involved areas if they hurt too much.  Good luck to you.",

Many ladies with your type do live many years with treatment, and you are just starting your learning process. Cancers do not \"automatically\" metastasize, many never do! Talk to an oncologist ASAP to get a good handle on your tissue type, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and HER status, and thef you are ok with it, post your information ( age also helps us get to know you, with your kids) so people can direct you to the right subforums for assistance suggestions and support. Get some idea what docs are proposing ( surgery, chemo, XRT, or what). Meanwhile consider talking to your primary about a sedative to help get you through this rough time, if appropriate for you. Moderators can help suggest a few \"getting started\" threads too, especially relating to telling kids what is happening once you know more. Remember you are not alone, people here can be supportive and helpful to guide you ",

When my breast biopsy doctor called with the results she immediately had ready the \"good news\" part of my tumor type to mitigate my potential for freaking out, apparently your nurse navigator did not offer you that, so sorry. I agree with MarilynIlli and others about bringing DH or someone with you to keep track of what they say, take notes, help you with pre-written questioms, or ask permission if you can record information on your iphone for later review. Your mind will not be totally focussed.  I would also call your primary care doc or ob/gyn now, do not wait, and ask for some prescription sedatives appropriate to your medical history, given the understandable terror you feel ( he will give you usual and appropriate caution about not driving or drinking until you know how you react after trying them). Have them there, try them with DH or someone around, and then have more ready to use if needed, like before the appointment, even if you may not feel you need them. Yoga and organic food and prayers from usalone right now just won't cut it, though they may help,  250,000 times per year in the US women get calls about positive biopsies. I knew that even though only 1/4 biopsies are positive for CA, I tend to defy odds , for the worse, in everything in my medical history. I had left permission to leave confidential voicemails on my iphone with results after the biopsy and knew when the doc left a message saying \"I have your results, call me\" instead of leaving the message \" it's benign!\" results that it would be positive.  They will systematically check where it is, with appropriate tests, do not assume it is all over you, with most women it is not.  Best wishes for a good doctor session and the best possible reports, workup and therapy, and coping with being a mom of young kids at the same time. I know it is not much to offer, but remember this forum is here for you and your husband for support, he can post too",

However, patients with breast cancer can also get other more benign things, like age related osteoarthritis of the spine, which might show on a plain Xray, or a non-cancerous fragility fracture even without trauma which would also show on a plain film. A good history and physical exam by a doc is also in order (e.g., to see if there is local pain at a bony site, is there neurologic involvement on exam going down the leg like pts can get with sciatica or lumbar disc disease, is she on meds that can cause back pain like AI etc). Sometimes it is also just lumbar muscle sprain, e.g., did she lift anything heavy like a child Some docs can also run a bone alkaline phosphatase blood level to see if elevated, it reflects an increase in bone turnover ( from healing fractures, mets, or other metabolic causes, even vitamin D deficiency) if bone scan is not easily available quickly. she should see the doc who has her whole record, and tell the whole story.",

Given you told them up front you have a bleeding history, it is annoying that she delegated your biopsy to a nurse, instead of doing it herself so she would be there just in case there was something in her expertise above that of the nurse that could have minimized the bleeding (maybe it would have, maybe it would not have). It was inappropriate in any event of the nurse to joke and laugh about all the bleeding you had, probably nervous \"oopsie\" laughter because she did not take you seriously when you told her, instead time she should have just apologized and made sure you were ok and told you she would note it in the chart so extra care could be taken next. Next time you go, I would ask them to put in writing into your chart that you bleed easily, and persist in making sure it is there every time you see a doctor. Assuming you are not on aspirin, non-steroidals, some herbals, or other meds that make people bleed easily, and you have a normal platelet count and coagulation profile (did they even check?), this may be relevant to how they plan your upcoming surgery, or they may even want to investigate your coagulation profiles more pre-op. I am also an easy bleeder and easy bruiser (due to my prednisone therapy for my autoimmune problems) and warn them repeatedly. A medical oncologist should generally be able to talk to you more about your options and answer your questions, as they are in charge of the big picture and not just the cutting, but it is sad that this surgeon did not even give you an outline, which I understand most do to some degree, of basic pros and cons of LX vs MX. Because, as you point out, knowledge can make a difference in your decision whether to do a lumpectomy or mastectomy, and the timing thereof, it is critical to have those conversations. I had talked to an awesome medical oncologist on the phone about 10 minutes before I saw her at all weeks later (referred by my primary care, the MOC had called me to talk almost immediately, it was the end of a day), then saw the surgeon the MOC strongly recommended as being among the best in the area (she is not on my insurance plan, so insurance only pays a part of her fee, but often you get what you pay for and if I am paying extra , non-preferred providers know they have to offer something extra to patients or no one will bother seeing them, with their higher fees ). The surgeon then outlined options, meanwhile I was doing all my reading, and then, well-informed, we went ahead with the LX (I still had issues with the anesthesiology pre-op, but that is another story). I keep seeing the BS for wound follow-up, but the big plan is now in the hands of the MOC, whom I have met and like. I am happy that she is a person who thinks outside the box and is not just a systems robot trying to push me into just following a standard one size fits all algorithm, she is treating me as an individual with a complicated past medical history that makes decisions not so simple. She went over all my questions, looked at all my notes, seemed to be thinking hard, and spoke frankly about unknowns, showed me papers on her iPhone that addressed specific questions and I took down the citations to read on my own. Dagny, I hope your next visit with the next BS goes better, that you see a MOC, and that you also keep your psychiatrist appointment to get early input on setting up a plan of mental health care for you.",

Mammo center did not want to do ultrasound unless they could do the full mammo, did not want the liability. I finally went to another center and was able to complete the mammo. BC has probably been growing slowly the last few years.  ND girl who posted upthread about mammogram pain is right that the pain of mammograms deters many women from having them (even if they have insurance coverage, risks, and know they should). Now, am still getting opinions about whether to do radiation and/or anti-hormonal therapy because I also have a complex history of autoimmune diseases which is a relative contraindication to both, greater risk of side effects, and I already have chronic pain.

I am considering five day radiation ( vs. no radiation) after my 11/22/17 lumpectomy heals up, for a grade I stage I tumor, lymph nodes negative, due to fears I have of traditional radiation side effects I may be extra vulnerable to due to autoimmune problems, RSD, andfibromyalgia. I see a radiation oncologist this week",

I did not have the strength to get into a proper position and the hard machine pushed horribly on my sore chest wall muscles. They would have to knock me out and lift me like a slab to do it  ",

It is so important to get you on an appropriate PTSD med regimen ( plus counseling of course) as you are going to have a lot more prodding and poking of breasts in the next few months. Even if the appt is not until around 12/17, I suggest telling them that you are available sooner for short-notice if there are cancellations, or for a different psychiatrist ( still one who can prescribe, not just a talker)if an appointment opens up sooner. Many psychiatric patients who get scheduled cancel their appointments short notice so it is not impossible that this could work.",

Only five nodes were taken with my lumpectomy ( one larger sentinel and four tiny for the ride as they were attached) so odds of LE are very low. I know it can come years later. A key reason I am refusing XRT is increasing risk of LE, but my tumor type is pretty good, and I am 63, and I have autoimmune disease which increases problems with tissue healing. Keep in mind the vast majority of women, with a competent surgeon ( which you have) do not get lymphedema. The more nodes removed, the greater the risk, however",

Do talk! One step at a time! What you may be referring to ( especially if you are still pre-menopausal) is use of tamoxifen, where some antidepressants ( which are also often used in PTSD) can diminish tamoxifen effectiveness if they inhibit an enzyme called CYP2D6. Paxil is the most notorious inhibitor of this enzyme, and there are others like prozac ( postulating you might have tamoxifen ultimately be offered to you, maybe it will not be) , but not all mood meds do, so many are not contraindicated with tamoxifen, e.g., citalopram is usually ok. A good psychopharmacology trained psychiatrist can usually find a good choice or two, A psychiatrist can also prescribe anxiolytics to help deal with your procedures that have no relation to anti-estrogen therapy, and she can work with counselors and your oncologist in a multidisciplinary approach to find a cocktail of med and behavioral approaches that works and are safe and effective, custom to your needs. The computerized medical record, if you get all your problems and meds correctly entered in, can also check for significant cross-reactions each time a change is made. You are just getting started on your course of therapy, so though it is superstressful, and overwhelming, stay as optimistic as possible. Here is a link to a brief discussion on this forum of antidepressant meds interacting (or not interacting with) tamoxifen http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/ser...  Best of luck tomorrow",

Holding arms over my head for even five minutes, much less 30, is painful ( barely made it through the bone scan) and having to hold my breath twenty seconds at a time as the RO recommended she would do to protect my borderline heart, (I am 63) is another concern. I could not tolerate a prone MRI at all, too much pain on my muscles from the metal and pushing, so prone radiation to protect the heart is out. I will probably decline radiation, but still have till January to decide.  ",
