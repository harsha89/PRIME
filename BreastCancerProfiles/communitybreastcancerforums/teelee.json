I was diagnosed with bc in Feb/09 and had my surgery Mar.24/09. I also had a hysterectomy a number of years ago (still have my ovaries). I know cancer is a scary thing to go through, just keep positive!! MamaLambNC, IDC & DCIS me too. Yes there is lot's to think about. Only you can decide what is best for you. I chose to have a lumpectomy and radiation. I was leaning towards a mastectomy until my doctor was unwilling to remove both breasts. Luckily my HER2 was negative and chemo was not required in my case. I am now in week 3 of radiation, it's not that bad....better then the alternative! I found that knowledge was power. So be informed, know what they're talking about. I understand that you're scared, I think a person would have to be crazy not to be!! Just be grateful you live in this generation where they are well equipped to treat us, 20 years ago they weren't as fortunate. It will be okay, vent if you have to. People here on this site all understand. Take care",

It was tough emotionally hearing the words that my mom had cancer (not bc), which she found out in Nov. 08. She had surgery in Dec.08, and has been going through chemo treatments as we speak. I found my lump in Jan. 09. I went through surgery and most of my recovery before I ever told her. It has been a tough few months, but I am keeping it positive! I have read about herceptin, as part of my treatment. I was suppose to be moving to a foreign country at the end of the year, I think this treatment might be changing my plans! Michele, you obviously must be on hormone therapy? How is that going for you? Thank you again",

Invasive Carcinoma was (nottingham) NS 2 TS 2 MS 1, histological gr. 1 DCIS nuclear gr. 2 ER/PR +++(3 strong) HER -2 +++(3 strong) Negative Nodes 0/2 Just wondering what I can expect to hear from the Dr. . I started out thinking that because I had found the lump early, 5 weeks of radiation and I would be done. Now, obviously that will not be the case. Would love some insight from others that have been there. Thanks Dx 2/18/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
