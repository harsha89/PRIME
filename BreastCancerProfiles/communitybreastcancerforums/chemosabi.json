The problem is there are a group of women who know how to change their IP address.  I see the same stalkers coming here as newbies.  They dont think I know who they are - but I do.  I just ignore them now.  If they write something negative be it in a parody or poem - now I just have to fax it to the officer following my case. Ruth - good luck to you.  Just like the government doesnt like cyber bullies with our children, they dont like cyber bullies and stalking of a breast cancer survivor.  If you want to file a complaint pm me and I will give you the name and address of how to begin the process.

      "Content": "Mar 8, 2008 09:55AM - edited Mar 8, 2008 09:57AM by chemosabi I liked pink long before I was diagnosed with breast cancer.  When I was first diagnosed I went crazy - everything was pink.  Hats, lipstick - ribbons, purses, shoes!  After chemo - I got rid of all the pink stuff.  Just like yoplait, almost every company that gets into the pink things for breast cancer has a limit to the amount they will donate.  Research!  Cure!  Thats what we need to put our energy towards.  There is a local hospital that has ribbons for all kinds of cancer. There are designated colors for each be it breast, ovarian, prostate, colon etc.  So I went to the saleperson and asked her how much of the money/profit is donated for cancer when someone buys one of these ribbons.  To my surprise she said none!  None I thought!!  This is a hospital - treating people - and you donate none!  That was the last time I bought anything. I believe in my heart - that there are millions of dollars out there, and if used appropriately, we would have a cure. Yes, compared to other cancers \"breast cancer\" seems to be considered the pretty disease. Well its not pretty.  And we keep losing sisters everyday from it. 15 years ago my sister passed away at the age of 46 from Ovarian cancer.  They didnt have genetic testing at the time.  Her gyne/onc recommended I get a bilateral mastectomy and remove my ovaries.  At the time I thought to myself - well thats a little drastic.  If I had done what he recommended, I would never have considered myself a survivor!  12 years later, breast cancer er/pr negative, her2+,+node, and brca2+.   I dont have mets - I come here because Im so tired of losing friends to this disease.  I come here to support all of you who are in a constant battle everyday of your lives. I want a cure and I want it now. Nicki (aka chemosabi)",

It was my PCP who gave me the news!  I didnt want to hear it over the telephone so I made an appointment and brought my DH with me.  I was shocked at how easy it was for him to tell me.  He looked at the report and said you have breast cancer.  Bam wham thank you mam.  I was being treated in the same hospital I worked at and hand picked my team of doctors - so they all knew me. I think the hardest thing for me was what my perception of breast cancer was before I was diagnosed with it.  Thought it was this easy thing that could be fixed and back to work within a month.  Other than staging, I knew nothing about hormone receptors and HER2 status etc. I knew nothing about breast reconstruction.   So all of a sudden my world was turned upside down.  ER/PR negative, HER2 positive.  Sentinel node positive.  Then entered the world of chemo!  I like many other people thought it was a \"designer disease.\"  Instead found out its a killer disease and I believe every step of this journey has not been easy.  3 years and counting! Stages, grades, microcalcifications - etc - were all very foreign to me.  I loved my BS but do remember him telling me to stay away from the computer and looking up things would make me more confused.  But Ha - stubborn nurse that I am - I didnt listen.  I found bco April 2005 and have been on this site everyday since.  Most everything I learned was from the information and support here.  I have noticed, my peers take the diagnosis with a grain of salt and I am constantly trying to educate them.  My life has forever changed and everytime I feel and ache or pain I find start self diagnosing myself.  Always convinced that in some way its cancer related.  I hated being a patient.  I hate having to say yes on any medical forms that ask do you have a history of cancer.  It still puts shivers though my whole body.  I have gone from one doctor my PCP to what I call my group.  BS, PCP, Onc, PS, ortho and cardiologist because the herceptin caused temporary heart failure.  Never in a million years did I think I would be saying the words \"my onc.\"  I lost my spark for along time - but eventually it came back.  Its just a differnt spark! Glad I found ya all. Nicki",

Also, I think the hardest thing for me to do was say \"my oncologist say.\"  Never in a million years did I think I would be referring to MY oncologist!  I would love to become one of those nurses who works as a breast cancer navigator!  Nicki",

      "Content": "Sep 19, 2008 05:08AM - edited Sep 19, 2008 05:14AM by chemosabi Hello to my fellow nurses.  I too am a nurse.  Graduated in 1969 as a LPN then worked full time while I went to school.  Finially finished and  I have been a registered nurse since 1986.  Started out working in ICU/CCU.  Somehow I got into management - dont ask me why lol.  Anyways, I have a nice job now.  Clinical Nurse Liaison for a SNF.  I get to go to different hospitals to evaluate people.  I think the thing that bothered my most when I was first diagnosed is how little I knew about breast cancer.  So it hit me pretty hard when the reality sunk in.  I was diagnosed 3 months after starting a new job.  I was so lucky, my company supported me 100%. Since my experience, we have now set up a special unit for cancer patients who need rehab.  Got myself Onc certified and am trying to help patients and families who are faced with the diagnosis of cancer.   I also believe that most of us are advocates.  We want to help each other here, and also help those out in the community who are facing the same challenges we are now facing with a diagnosis of breast cancer.  A good nurse, who really cares, would never be mean to another one.  I like this thread alot, because Im seeing so much breast cancer out there and have so many stories to share.  Nicki",
