      "Content": "busser211 wrote: I just have this horrible feeling. Two months ago, I found a rather large lump deep in my right breast. It's now shaped like a christmas tree hook, with the point ending right below my areola. I first found it in the shower two months ago, but I was only a few days from starting my period, so I waited. I hasn't gone away. It's gotten slightly bigger. It doesn't move; feels firmly rooted like an extra rib almost. My right nipple (not areola, just nipple) is much darker than my other nipple, and there's these two big dark veins that have started showing through the areola. I feel a weird sensation, like I'm nursing and my milk is letting down, except that I haven't nursed a baby in over 12 years. Sometimes it throbs, sometimes the sensation reaches into my armpit. I called the OB/BYN office two weeks ago, and they set up an appointment for me to come in and get it checked out. I am scared to death. I can't think about anything else. I can't focus at all. How do I calm myself down? Log in to post a reply",

She seemed concerned about my armpit area, and has scheduled me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. I'm only 33, so if any of you ladies can tell me what to expect during a mammogram, I'd really appreciate it. It scares the heck outta me for some reason.",
