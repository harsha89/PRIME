I had a follow up with my BS yesterday and the ultrasounds showed everything looks great. Some fluid in the left breast, but she said not enough to aspirate and my body should absorb it. Today is exactly two weeks post-op and I got to take a BATH!!! I've been showering since the day after surgery, and I'm grateful for that opportunity...but I'm a bath person. I didn't have a marathon session or anything, but the 25 minutes or so I was in the tub were sublime! I'm off pain meds and I've driven a couple times with no issues. So grateful for the miracles of modern medicine!!",

Everything went well, and I've been home since 3/18 recovering. I saw my PS on the 22nd, and he removed all four of my drains and gave me a compression garment to wear for a week. I see him again on April 3rd. My path report looks good, tentatively. Still waiting on my oncatype, but it looks like I'll be able to avoid IV chemo. I'm also waiting for the results of genetic testing. I see my BS on the 28th, but she won't have the results to either of the pending tests yet. She's recommended a complete hysterectomy and five years of Tamoxifen. I haven't seen an oncologist yet. I think my recovery is going well. My main source of discomfort is the center of my chest where the surgeons apparently cut through cartilage to connect the blood supply to my flaps. It isn't unmanageable though, and I began weaning myself off prescription pain meds today. My PS is Dr. Scott Sullivan with the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans. I cannot say enough about what a positive experience this has been, breast cancer diagnosis aside, of course. This place is a dream. I'm so excited about the second stage surgery in three months. I honestly think that is helping with my recovery - knowing that this is just the first phase and having the second \"fine tuning\" surgery to look forward to makes the discomfort easier to bear. I'm nervous about Tamoxifen because of the weight gain SE I've read about. I had elective weight loss surgery (vertical sleeve gastrectomy on 7/21/14 - which I'm still paying on, incidentally) that resulted in a 100 pound loss. Gaining the weight back terrifies me! Hopefully I'll be one of the lucky ones for whom weight gain isn't an issue. I'm grateful for this forum, and to have the opportunity to receive and offer support from our shared experience. I joined a similar group following my weight loss surgery, and it has been helpful - I'd even say instrumental - to my success. I look forward to chatting with y'all. Christina",

      "Content": "Apr 6, 2017 06:57PM - edited Apr 6, 2017 07:24PM by Xtina78 Hi, everyone! Had a second follow up with PS Monday, and he said everything is healing beautifully and he doesn't need to see me again until I'm ready for the second stage surgery. Yay! And I got even BETTER news from my BS, who called to say my genetic testing was negative, and my oncotype score is a 16! So those test results along with clear nodes and a 1cm margin mean no chemo! I am so, so grateful and relieved!!! Three week post-op yesterday, so I'm planning to return to the office mid-week next week and see how it goes. Pugs - I got my wedge from Bed Bath & Beyond and it has been hands down the most helpful item I bought in preparation of surgery. I got an adjustable one that folds into four different positions, and its plush and comfy. It was around $100, which I wasn't thrilled about...but it definitely turned out to be money well spent! I use it for everything from working to sleeping",

My surgeon said no underwire until I'm 'completely healed' which I think they interpret to mean 4 weeks post-op. Clothing for me was loose button down pj's in the hospital and then really nothing once I was home but a robe thrown over the bra and panties the hospital provided. Now I'm in yoga pants and t-shirts with neck holes wide enough that I don't have to raise my arms over my head to get them on. I haven't been too terribly hungry since surgery. In my post-op instructions it was suggested to eat carbs in the beginning for easy digestion and transition to protein 4-5 days post-op to aid in healing. Whatever your diet, plan to take stool softeners immediately after surgery and have some gentle overnight laxatives on hand. The anesthesia and pain meds really backed me up.",

My PS said I really wouldn't experience much pain in my breasts because they'd be numb following surgery, but that I would have a lot of abdominal pain because he sewed my muscles together for the tummy tuck, and because there would be far less nerve damage in my abdominal area. It's been exactly the opposite. My belly is completely numb, and what little muscle pain there was is pretty much gone now. But my new breasts have plenty feeling, and I suppose the nerves are regenerating because they feel like...a weird combination of electricity and mild ant bites...only way I can think to describe it. Anyone else experiencing this?",
