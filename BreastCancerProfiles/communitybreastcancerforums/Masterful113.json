About 1.5 months ago I found a pea sized lump on my left breast at around 2 o'clock. I had an ultrasound on it and the technician didn't find anything. I was still concerned so I went back to the gyn and he did a FNA on the lump because it was very palpable. It was firm but movable. The results came back benign/fibrosis. So I stopped worrying at that point but kept tabs on the lump. I checked it every day and it seemed to get more squishy after I got my period. So then I go ahead and get pregnant which I am excited about but still worried. The pregnancy horomones must have cause the lump to go away. The pea sized lump seemed to have vanished... so wierd but then I noticed that I have some thick tissue below the lump... which I think was there before but hiding under the lump. I thought they were the same thing at the time. So I was still concerned at that point. I went back to the gyn and he said he couldn't really feel what I was feeling. He said he could recommend me to a breast surgeon. I was shocked at the time... thinking a breast surgeon, this isn't necessarily cancer... that seemed too much to me. I then requested a script for another Ultrasound because I just felt like we were missing something. Turns out they found this thick tissue on my 2nd Ultrasound. It looks a little funny. Flat on the bottle and almost wavy looking on the top. The radiologist didn't know what to make of it. He said he could rule out fibroadenoma. He said it almost looks like a hematoma from the FNA but that was over a month ago. That seems unlikely. He told me he wanted me to go for an MRI. I fought with the MRI radiologist saying I didn't feel comfortable using the gadolinium contrast dye because it can cause birth defects and still birth in babies. He said he may be able to get what he needs without it so I went ahead and did the MRI. He told me that the left breast is showing more activity but it is also a bit larger than my right breast. He also said that the lymph node is a bit larger on my left breast... but the lymph node would be larger when you have a larger breast. I saw something on the screen that looked like the lump and he tells me that anything showing that brightly in \"T2\" is extremely unlikely to be cancer. He didn't seem concerned whatsoever about it. This lump on the screen seemed to be right where my lump actually is but yet he dismissed it and seemed to be concerned with the increased activity in the left breast. He told me to come back for another MRI in 3 weeks. I am going crazy thinking about this... how can I wait 3 weeks when I am pregnant... what if I had to terminate the pregnancy because I have cancer? I don't understand why I would wait that long. I am almost 6 weeks pregnant now. I decided I want to see a breast surgeon now after all because I need another opinion. I am not concerned really with this increased activity in my left breast... I am concerned about the lump but somehow that becomes the issue. Also, if I did wait 3 weeks, I might have more increased activity because I'm pregnant. The MRI and Ultrasound radiologist also dont want me to get another biopsy because they are afraid it will mess up the imagin but I am thinking to just have another biopsy on the thick tissue. I am thinking it is possible that the thick tissue was part of the original lump but I don't want to take my chances. This thick tissue seems to be a bit lower than 2 o'clock. It is more like 3 o'clock but runs in a vertical line right next to my areola. It doesn't seem very big. From feeling it, it seems to be about a cm in length at most. It feels sort of like 2 lumps next to eachother but vertically. When I lay down they feel pretty hard. When I sit up they feel firm and moveable but they are sort of connected in the line and my other lump that seemingly disappeared would have been right at the top of this line if it was still there. What would you do in my situation? My appointment with the breast surgeon is tomorrow morning. Should I ask for another biopsy? Thank you all for your help!!! Log in to post a reply",
