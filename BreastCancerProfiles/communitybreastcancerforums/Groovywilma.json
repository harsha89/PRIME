I will be monitoring any side effects and symptoms for the next week. I did get the On-Pro Neulasta. It's on my arm right now and will administer the medication 27 hours after my chemo was finished. I'm feeling OK right now so we'll see how things go after the pre-meds wear out. Have a good weekend and have a great birthday!",

It let's me enjoy the second and third week having more energy before having to go back. This dose seems to be pretty hard on my red blood cells and I've been more anemic with this dose. I have been doing the Procrit injections, but even weekly it hasn't boosted the red blood cells. I almost was going to have a blood transfusion this week, but the pharmacists want to monitor for another week or two to see about increasing the dose of Procrit or deciding to do the blood transfusion (and they will discuss with my doctor when he comes back from vacation). I've been on Neulasta and the bad part is the bone pain I get from the medication stimulating those white blood cells. No fun! But the good things is that it's keeping those white blood cells in a good range. I'm getting the neuropathy in my fingers and toes and today was given a prescription for gabapentin. I've also been experiencing tingling in my chin/ lower lip which I think might be neuropathy, which is pretty uncommon. I have an MRI scheduled to check it out. So that's my experience so far with the Taxol every three weeks. I'm hoping for good results when I do my next PET scan (probably next month). And I am considering my options of going back to work... a hard decision to make! ",

I took metamucil to help with the constipation. I had quite a bit of hair thinning when I first started it, but not many people noticed this (I have thick hair to start with, so that helped). It started growing back in and thickening up after six months or so. Unfortunately after 10 months I had progress so I had to change treatment. I would not have minded staying on Gemzar longer! Pre-meds included decadron and zofran. I am getting zometa quarterly. If you have any questions, let me know! PM me in case I miss reading things. Sometimes I don't get around to reading everything!

I still have the pain in my hip/ groin but it's not too bad.  I can't walk as far or as fast as I used to, but for the most part it is manageable with ibuprofen.  I have vicoden also but that does not really help.  We haven't done any radiation at this time because the doc says the cancer isn't in any real solid places at this time for it to be effective.   So for now I am on tamoxifen and monthly zometa.  I hope that this works and shrinks all the cancer so they shrivel up and go away!  Best of luck to you!    ",

For me, smoothies in my Vitamix are quick and easy and filling. Just keep frozen fruits in your freezer. You don't have to use milk, you can use almond milk, rice milk, or skip milk and just use water or juice. You can also add yogurt, or anything, really, to help get more nutrients. And it's a quick rinse afterwards! My other secret is my NUWAVE oven. It's great when I haven't planned ahead and want something that's been in the freezer. It takes the cook time down without having to defrost, and you can put all kinds of things in there! Salmon, chicken, frozen pizzas, etc. I'll be following this thread to get more ideas!",

When I was on Gemzar I would notice I couldn't go the same day, and the next day. On the 3rd day when I would go, it would be pebble like. I called it pebble poo. The rest of the week would be back to normal. After a while I started to incorporate Metamucil every day and that helped a lot. the pebble poo became regular poo, but the same day and next day I still usually didn't go. Also later in the game I added prune juice which helped a lot. For sleep, I often had difficulty sleeping the first and second night. I would be able to go to sleep, then I would wake up at 4am and not be able to go back to sleep. It was due to the steroid pre-meds. I started taking sleep aids to help with this, and it did. Wishing you both luck on Gemzar and that you find it manageable and effective for a loooooong time! I was on it for 10 months. I had some fatigue, but it was pretty manageable.",

I had one injection so far and had a lot of bone pain, even with the Claritin/ naproxen combo that was suggested. But definitely don't want low WBC to become a problem (again). Thanks!",
