      "Content": "BeeMack wrote: Well I had my mastectomy w/o reconstruction April 19. I seem to be doing ok. Originally she thought 10 of the 13 nodes were positive, but it turned out only 4 were positive. That was encouraging. Am doing the \"drain thing\" right now and getting really anxious for that to be removed! Took a Darvocet last night for pain and had horrible nightmares all night. So back to Tylenol and Ibuprofen. Anyway, my goal is to stay POSITIVE, stay HEALTY and enjoy life. Next step is Onocologist. Love to you all and we ARE in this together. Log in to post a reply",
