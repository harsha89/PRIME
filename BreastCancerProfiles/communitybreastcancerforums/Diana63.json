I have had this happen to me many times since dx and I always say the same thing. Maybe I'm not the one you should be talking to, call a friend that hasn't had cancer and complain about wanting bigger boobs or acting like a mammogram is the most painful thing in life. Or they really get stupid and say something like I could never do what you did, I wouldn't have done chemo. My response to them is I hope you never have to make that choice. It all goes back to the saying if you have nothing good to say then say nothing at all. I have hung up on people mid conversation when they go on and on about something stupid. I know I;m a monster for not understanding why, the store not having the shoes you wanted in your size completely screwed up you week. Or the lady at the salon didn't double rinse your hair so now you have the frizzes. Come on people life is to short to complain about shoes and hair, and yes I was like this before dx. I have been around to many sick people to complain about stupid things. OK I'm sorry I went off on my own rant but you got me going ;) My point is you have every right to rant, sometimes we need to vent and get upset. Rant on my friend, we are here to listen. BTW can anyone tell I'm in a real bad mood?",

I had a muga scan before chemo and my heart was at 58%, 1 year later it was working at 12%. I was going to a doctor every week at the time, and complained about shortness of breath and leg weakness. He said its just the chemo working its way out of your body. Basically acting like I was being a baby, and to just drink more fluids and exercise. Do you believe that? I had to go to the ER and was told I had CHF, then they said chemo cant cause CHF. I said then why was my muga scan last year ok and now its not? I am just now getting better from CHF, I don't know what % my heart is working at now but I am feeling better than I have in 2 years. I had 47 pounds of fluid on my body, and they took a litter out of each lung.  Now my cardiologist says that chemo did cause it, which I already knew that. All I can say to all of you ladies if you have shortness of breath, during or after treatment dont let them tell you it's nothing to worry about. My heart may not have gotten that bad if the doctor had listened to me and sent me to a cardioligest right away.",

Most of the time if someone doesn't know the answer, they will try to point you in the right direction. As far as the mastectomy that can only be answered after you get your surgery. I had a left breast skin sparring mastectomy, its not as bad as you might think it is.  Like formygirls said everyones treatments are different, as your plan unfolds it will be easier to understand.  Good luck see you around the board",

I just feel like such a mess, the oncol. saw this when I was in for my appt. and acted like it would just go away. Has this happened to any of you and if it did what did you do to help with SE's? I would go back to the doctor but all he talk about is my blood count, they weren't that low after treatment. I go to a hospital clinic so I get a different doctor most of the time, its so frustrating to do everything they tell you to do then they just wash their hands of you.

First off you are in the right place, in the hospital they can find that nasty bug that you picked up and get rid of it. You have to remember that your immune system is very low from chemo, so its no wonder you picked up something. I wish that your DH could be with you but with your personality I'll bet all of the nurses and doctors want to adopt you and take you home with them. I know that it sucks being in the hospital but your DH and DD will spoil you rotten when you do come home. I hope that you sleep well, my thoughts and prayers are with you. Diana",

That being said I wished I hadn't followed along like a good little cancer patient, maybe I wouldn't have went into heart failure after radiation. I was dx at stage 3 and thought I was being a big baby during my first dx and treatment. I would come here and read of all of the other ladies working, running, swimming & etc. I thought gee I'm the biggest baby in the world, but what was happening was my old heart was about to give out. I worked until I couldnt walk anymore. So I guess I'm saying its hard to judge how someone else feels, maybe they have things going on under the surface. Things that no one notices because cancer is the main concern while we are in treatment. God Bless",

I sometimes look at the % too but you have to remember it was based on a lot of different information. If stage 1 & 2 are haveing better prognoses then we cant be far behind, the same goes for stage 4 they are only a step away from us, I believe we will get thier together. Also they never say anything about the womens health, age or type of BC that they have. They are going on block studies where different women are put into one category.",

As far as Debs offensive post or anyone else's, we are all adults here if you don't like it don't click it. Why do we even need to report a post unless some is being attacked is beyond me. It didn't offend me, so I continued reading. Deb just says what she feels and isn't that what this board is all about? (Our feelings, good bad or worse) She has never attacked anyone on this board and she has been through a lot in a short amount of time. Come on people cut her some slack, and just move on to the nest topic. I ran into this on the alternative board, I made a statement about SS and all He!! broke loose.

The one I'm seeing now just says, I'm pretty sure we can get it under control but keeping it away is another story.  The stats they use are out dated IMO. They lump all of the different types of BC together along with different age groups & health types. Also some of the women in the stats may have opted to have no treatment at all for their BC, I will be glad when they fix those offal stats and stop scarring women into thinking its hopeless. Your husband is right go find another doctor, and try not to listen even if the next one says something like the last one did. You have seen for yourself right here, that many women are surviving and thriving after BC. Keep you hopes up don't let any doctor or anyone tell you what you can do.",

I have a question for those who have already started, can you drive yourself home after chemo & does anyone know of a good multi vitamin to help boost your immune system? Well that was two questions . Besides the normal vitamins A, B12, C and etc. I have read that garlic is good to boost your immune system, and many others but it looks like to many vitamins to take in one day.",

The last time I put it on they thought they were going to have to cut it off. I said you will not cut it off, they said its just metal and a rock. I said maybe its not a big deal to you but me and that ring have been together for over 26 years. Yes, its a very small diamond but my husband who was only 19 when we married, put that on my finger and I wont let you cut it off.  I have changed my babies diapers with that ring on, and we held my mothers hand when she went home to the Lord. You already took my breast but you will not take my ring without a fight. So ask yourself are you feeling lucky punk, because you aint taking this ring with out a fight. OK, fast forward to last night, I put it back on for the first time since we pried it off my finger 2 years ago, and it hasn't swelled yet. Like I said its a tiny ring but its mine and hidden inside it are 28 years of marriage, love sweat and tears. We have been through a lot together and it feels good to have her back where she belongs on my left hand.

If all else's fails I can file bankruptcy, I just hope it doesn't come to that. True story: When this all happened I was going to another cancer treatment center, the lady said well look at it this way at least you will be around to pay for your new healthy body. I just looked at her and I said so your saying I have to pay in order to live? She just smiled and said I didn't mean it that way, I said then what did you mean? Then she said well maybe you should have thought about this and got insurance, I said I did have insurance you Cow but what does that have to do with anything.? My husband had to drag me out of their, I wanted to rip her out of her seat. Sweet story: My family knows about the trouble that I am having and, they all got together and decided they would mortgage their homes to buy mine for me. Of course I told them no but it sure made me feel good that they would even think of doing that for me. Dana here is a web site that might help you, I tried it but my state (Ohio) isn't having open enrollment until June. http://www.coverageforall.org/ D1, The neupogen seems a lot easier on me, I have only had one shot so far. This week I will be having one everyday, so I will know if its better by the end of the week. It is a pain going in to get the shot but if I'm not rolling on the floor in pain it will be worth it. I am so glad that you are almost done, a few months from now we call all look back and say hey remember when this or that happened.  Goodnight everyone",

If their is a problem I'm sure that they could handle it. Dana, I think that its great that you are becoming a nurse, you will know what it is like on the other side of the bed or recliner. Not only will you take care of their physical needs but you will show the compassion of a surviver. I don't know about the mask thing, I have heard some people say not to worry about getting sick, and others say you should protect yourself from germs. I have also been finding myself thinking about death, although I have tried so hard to have a positive outlook. Then I was talking to a friend that had heart surgery, and she said you will forget most of it in time. Your life will grow after chemo, and things will move into the place you once worried about Cancer. She should know she has been through hell and back in the last three years but she has moved on and I though how she put it made so much since. I told her when I get through this, I want to be just like her living life.",

Believe me I don't want to file bankruptcy but I am running out of resource's. As I said I have contacted my congresswoman I will see where that leads me. My work is also trying to get the new insurance company to wave the waiting time to instate my insurance, its the same company that I had before just a different policy. I will also see the financial aid at the hospital that I am taking chemo at ASAP, I heard that sometimes drug companies have to donate a certain amount of chemo per year. (I think) I didn't mean to sound like I am just going to let it all go and file bankruptcy, I am still trying but I cant get as worked up as I was. I was going to stop my chemo and skip any treatment, thats why my family was so upset. I will just take it a step at a time and do everything they tell me to do, and hope that I will get some help from someplace. The thing is I can pay for insurance but I cant get covered, I had it at my old job but they filed bankruptcy and that meant no Cobra for me. I know that it will all work out and I will keep trying",

I got so mad because he said it was the same as my last blood test, I said then why didn't you tell me then so I could take some iron to build it up? I have been put off for to long, I told him if it keeps getting put off I might as well not do any chemo. Needless to say we did start and other than aching and a headache I don't feel to bad.
