I finally found an excellent surgeon from Argentina who not only said yes, he said, \"Of course!  So easy!  Your scar will be fine even after all of those other surgeries.\"  He was right.  It was a long surgery, like a mastectomy taking 5 hours!, but he not only removed the offending things, but gave me a good scar, which I treated with the clear burn bandages, and no more pain!  Find a good plastic surgeon [use the web, friends, other medical professionals you trust [nurses are the best!] and INSIST THAT YOU LOOK GOOD.  And you will not regret it -- there are sooo many options.  I went without one until this month and now have discovered a whole new world of boobies!  Among my favorite are the bean bag ones by Silique and Jodee, the Ameona flowing gell and almost all of the swim forms [sturdy, etc. -- I prefer the clear ones in triangel or modified triangle]  But the most fun are the Knit a Tit!  Funny!  And there are people who will knit beautiful, fun and sexy boobies!  You will feel much more female without the pain and misery of implants.  At least I do!  There is also a lady on breastfree.com who gives you a pattern to follow if you want to make a bean bag [I mean teenie weenie beans] form.  Have fun!  And I wish you lots of choices!  Linda ",
