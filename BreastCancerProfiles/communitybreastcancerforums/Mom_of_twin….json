Meg, please reply back to this thread after you talk to your oncologist. I already got three opinions from reputable oncologists on Chicago, and they all didn't recommend more chemo (I specifically asked about Xeloda/Create-X) study, and they said they would only consider that if I were triple negative. They all did recommend the Palbociclib trials. I'm going to Mayo Clinic next week for my 4th and final opinion. I know it seems overboard, but I want to know that I did everything I possibly could. I will report back here after my appointment. Please share more stories!!!! Any longer term survivors with residual cancer after chemo out there? Would love to hear from you, too!! ",

Very similar opinion to other oncologists: she said endocrine therapy is the biggest weapon for my type of cancer. She recommended a Palbo trial like the others (PALLAS); so I plan on enrolling in a couple weeks. I asked about Xeloda, and again, she said she would consider it only if I was triple negative. She also told me that if Xeloda was prescribed, it would be sequential, meaning that she would have me take Xeloda for several months, followed by an AI--that they usually don't prescribe together. That made me feel better because I wouldn't be comfortable waiting 6-12 months to be on the AI. She reiterated that I've done all I could (and more) to keep the cancer away. I think I'm ready to close this door on outside opinions (I've had 5 in total, and it's basically been a consensus). Now on to PALLAS and hopefully this cancer will stay away..... ",

LOL Meg, did you get genetic testing and if so what were your results (sorry if you already posted this)? I've been told the main reason they would suggest oophorectomy versus suppression is being BRCA+. I have a variant (favor polymorphism)on BRCA1; although currently considered benign, it still makes me nervous. But I agree--I'm relatively young (44), and will potentially be on an AI for up to 10 years. A shot every month will be difficult. I will probably try again with the surgery at some point, but I suppose it's no rush for now. How's everyone else? Also bumping in hopes to hear from others!! ",

They said chemo reduces that risk by approximately 30%, and hormonal therapy reduces it by 50%. So doing the math, the treatment brings me to about 15%. Ballpark risk they said was 10-15%. Anything is too high in my eyes, but I still worry that they are being optimistic considering my subpar response to chemo and positive nodes! I'm sorry you're not getting the Palbo. I'm sure that's very disappointing, and I'm trying to prepare myself for that disappointment, as I realize it's a good possibility. Rest assured, though, that Aromosin on its own is very powerful.",

I was told the deep breath hold is an effective way to spare the heart. They have to simulate the breath hold through mapping to ensure that your heart pulls out of the radiation field. Without a deep breath, the CT showed that a portion of my heart would be in the field, and it pulled completely out of field with a deep breath. So was an easy decision for me. Each session takes a bit longer, but worth it. I've had no lung issues, but I was told that a small part of the lung does get exposed, which can cause fibrosis (scarring).

Radiation has become so precise, that they have gotten really good at sparing the organs as much as possible. I was amazed at all of the thought and planning that went into my radiation treatments (RO, physicists, etc.). They literally care about millimeters and do all they can to spare heart and lungs. Even my cardiologist told me that he doesn't see radiation damage to the heart much anymore, and said how much it has improved over time. You can ask to see your \"mapping,\" which will show you exactly what is receiving the radiation and my guess is your heart won't be in the field at all. That might bring you some comfort--it did for me! Hang in there--it will be over soon! How's everyone else doing? Meg2016, we haven't heard from you in awhile! Would love to hear how you're doing!",

The one good thing about no Palbo is that in a way, it feels like I'm moving away from this cancer thing (although still enrolled in the trial). I was worried about how hard it would be to deal with the side effects that came along with it, along with the low blood counts and constant fear of getting an infection.

We all know how disappointing it is to not have a pathological complete response (PCR) from chemo. The reason it increases your risk of recurrence, is that there is data that shows those who have a PCR have an excellent prognosis. The theory is that if chemo kills all of the known cancer in breast tumor and/or nodes, it is extremely likely that it killed any rogue cells that may have left the breast. Without a PCR, there's more of a concern that there might be some lingering stray cells floating around. With that being said, being node-negative is huge, and bodes well for a good prognosis. Although it's possible floating cells could have escaped, that's less likely since you were node-negative. Most of us on this thread had positive nodes after chemo, which seems to be a much less favorable prognosis than if chemo cleaned them out. I've also read that the significance of PCRs are less significant for certain subtypes, such as triple positive. It's also very favorable that you were so strongly ER/PR+ because anti-hormonals should be very effective for you. As far as scans, that's a personal choice. It's terrifying going through them, but what a relief it would be when you heard they were all clear (which is pretty likely)? I thought scans were the worst part of the process, but I always reminded myself that not having them doesn't make the potential cancer go away. But total personal decision, and I totally get each perspective. I'm so sorry you received this disappointing news...and we all have been where you are. Personally, I think you have a great prognosis and it's great your tumor reduced over 50% in size! We all have to remember that only a small percentage get PCRs!! Edited to add: I was told on here that it's a good prognostic factor if your residual tumor changed to a low ki-67--so you have that going for you, too! Hang in there and please let us know how things are going for you. How's everyone else doing?  ",

The original pathology showed the ki67 as 30, so it brings a little comfort thinking that chemo killed the very aggressive stuff. Thanks for the information. Also, my onc is recommending a Palbo trial (PENELOPE or PALLAS), but of course there's a 50% chance of getting drug. sbelizabeth, I have tried to talk my onc (and some others) into Xeloda, but they just haven't budged! She and the others said they would consider it if I was triple negative, and continue to tell me that the AI is my biggest defense, even more so than chemo. I feel like I would mentally feel better if I got it, but these are all opinions from top docs in the US. Any tips on how to get someone to agree? Thanks to the others for your response! It helps to know you're doing well and that I'm not alone! I'm so hoping that many others who had residual disease please respond!!  ",

I signed consent for PALLAS today. Of course they tell you all the potential risks and side effects and it's scary!! Obviously, every medication has risks (think of all the commercials that list all of the side effects),and hopefully Palbo's benefits will outweigh the risks. Anyway, what's worried me most is what are the shorter and longer term repercussions of suppressing the immune system for two years? I still have fairly low platelets and lymphocytes and I'm 6 months out from chemo. Just wondering how much suppressing immune system for 2 years will affect body long-term? And one of the side effects is hair loss, and although not on top of my list of priorities, that is a bummer considering my hair is growing back. So I'm kind of scared to get it, and scared not to get it at the same time! Of course I want to do everything I can to keep this cancer away. I was also told that the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium is next week, and they are supposed to reveal some data regarding the Create-X study, regarding taking Xeloda when there's significant residual disease after chemo. I wonder if the data shows that it's beneficial for both triple negative and ER+ subtypes, would our MO's finally be willing to give it a try? Part of me just wants to get more treatment...go through that 6 months or a year of a chemo pill, and be done with it. Especially if it's been proven that it reduces risk in our subtype. I just wish we all had \"cleaner\" cancer and could just move on with our lives!! I created a post asking if anyone is on Xeloda or doing PALLAS trial; hoping to get some input there, too. Hope all is well! It's been quiet around here...would love to hear how everyone's doing!",

Kattis, I forgot to mention that they often use the \"Residual Cancer Burden (RCB)\" to assess prognosis/risk after neochemo. In order to calculate that, you'd need the measurement of the primary tumor bed, the percentage cellularity of residual tumor, the percentage of DCIS, and lymph node status (which yours is zero. Yeah!). There's a calculator online through MDAnderson where you can get your score using that info: http://www3.mdanderson.org/app/medcalc/index.cfm?p... The scores range from 0-III: 0 means no residual disease; I means minimal; II means moderate; and III is \"chemo-resistent.\" If interested, I can forward you a medical study which will tell you your risk level based on your RCB score. You might have had a much better response than you realize! And FYI--prognostically RCB I patients do as well as those with PCRs!! Hope this helps.   ",

And although we'd all love to do more, I suppose there is some comfort in the fact that so many reputable oncologists are providing the same recommendations and believe that hormonal therapy is our best defense. But I'm with you; I would pay whatever it took to get something more if it could reduce the risk of recurrence. Frankly, I wish I could just get the Ibrance outside of the trial, but I know that's just not how it works and it's not an option. I think it's a really good thing that your post-chemo tumor was HER2 equivocal--makes me think that the chemo killed the really aggressive stuff! I'm just wondering, did your oncologist talk statistics with you? Did she discuss your risk of recurrence percentage? I haven't gotten a really good feel of what my risk is, and am just wondering if others are given estimated numbers or percentages. As far as the ovary removal, I did attempt the surgery but it wasn't completed. During the procedure, I became severely bradycardic and they aborted. PLEASE don't let this scare you...it was just a rare fluke. And I swear, I'm always the fluke. It's a fairly routine outpatient procedure, and the vast majority have no problems with it at all. So, in the meantime, I got a Zoladex injection and started taking Anastrazole. I'm going to try the surgery again after the new year. But I was told that suppression and ablation are equally effective, so there's no rush on the surgery. I just wanted to get everything done in 2016 and have it all behind me. Didn't quite work out that way, but such is life. But yes, insurance did approve the surgery and I imagine yours would, too. Anyway, thanks for keeping us updated. I'm going to Mayo on Tuesday for my last outside opinion, and at that point, I just need to find peace and move on if she says the same as the other oncologists I've consulted with. I will let you know how it goes. ",

I had both a clear ultrasound and mammo just 7 months before diagnosis, and had been screened every six months since my sister's diagnosis in 2010. It's infuriating that despite being diligent, I still had relatively advanced BC. It literally popped up out of nowhere; but clearly it had been there for years. I wish one of my doctors had educated me more on dense breasts and how imaging can miss it. I wish so much it was caught earlier, but also grateful we caught it when we did. But imaging seriously failed me. No, my opinion is that you can get genetic testing first and see what the results are. Might be easier to decide about your daughters once you know your own results. But, of course, whatever brings you peace of mind.",

I really was surprised to be high in that scoring, because I appeared to have such a dramatic response to chemo based on manual exams and imaging. Like we all know too well, the truth lies in the pathology slides. My oncologist provided me a graph regarding RCB scores, which showed that 90% of ER+ patients with a RCB-2 are alive and well at 5 years. Triple negative, the risk level is so much higher as a RCB-2. All I know is that being an RCB-1 is an equivalent prognosis as having a PCR, and the prognosis becomes incrementally worse along the continuum of the RCB index As far as the oophorectomy, I'm also trying to understand if one is superior to the other (it's much more clear if you have a BRCA mutation). I tried to get the ooph, but my surgery went seriously awry. We'll see if I'm brave enough to try it again someday. But I have gotten the impression from some that keeping your ovaries has benefits; but don't understand that because they're making them non-functional with Zoladex or Lupron. I'd personally prefer to just get rid of them. Glad this thread is still going!! Hoping that we hear from others who had residual cancer after chemo and will share their stories!!",

I could be wrong, but I think where you're seeing 0-4, it is showing the numerical value of the RCB index, which is on a continuum. But to my understanding, the categories are I-III, based on the numerical value. With that being said, I deleted my link above with that educational and frightening article, as I worry it upset some of you. I'm terribly sorry -- not my intention. We're all in the same boat, so none of us like reading it. It's easy enough to find if anyone wants to learn more through google. I try to remind myself that's it's arbitrary. So many women have surgery first, and they have no idea how their cancer would actually respond to chemo. Clearly, most wouldn't have had PCRs and so many are doing fine years later. It is hard to be in an intermediate or poor prognosis category, and it's hard not to envy those who have \"cleaner\" cancer, so to speak. All cancer sucks, but it just feels like mine and others is just messier....I'm sure some of you feel the same. There's always worse and there's always better, I suppose. The hardest part for me is having 4 little girls and praying so hard that I'll see them grow up. We all so desperately just want to be here. Anyway, I'm off to bed. Have to get up early tomorrow. Another day...one day at a time. 😊 ",

You are amazing!! ajbclan, RCB (residual cancer burden) is a measurement that is used to assist with determining prognosis after neoadjuvant chemo. The variables are the residual tumor bed size, the percentage cellularity, amount of DCIS, and the number of lymph nodes with size of largest metastasis. It was developed by MD Anderson. Here's a link https://www.mdanderson.org/for-physicians/clinical... Also, you can google RCB and you will find some literature on it. Not all labs calculate your RCB; it is done during your surgical pathology analysis. So glad your tumors are shrinking!! That's a great sign! Keep us posted with your progress. As far as reconstruction, I did direct to implant and have no regrets. Of course it varies from person to person whether that is the logical/best option, but it was one of the best decisions I made. I even had radiation afterwards and my implant held up well. Good luck with everything! Meg, so glad you ordered the tea! There's literature that says it helps in reducing recurrence, and JH is so reputable. Prefer to drink something that was studied. I hope radiation is going well; before you know it, it will be behind you. And very cool that you met fightergirl!! Flatnfab, awesome that you had a PCR!! Glad you're doing so well.

I also was a candidate for proton radiation because my BC was on the left side. I was told the downside of proton therapy is that's it's harder on the skin and reconstruction, but does more precisely target the desired areas, while sparing the other organs/tissues. I ended up doing conventional radiation, but a very sophisticated technique. IMRT/RapidArc with the deep breath hold. The 3D mapping showed the deep breath hold pulled my heart completely out of the radiation field, so that's what was ultimately recommended. I'm glad you're exploring proton therapy; I'm a big believer in evaluating all available options and then making the best decision. Keep us posted and good luck with everything!",

I know the standard of care is to at least do a sentinel node biopsy, and often if any of those are positive, that is sometimes followed by axillary dissection. More recently, however, based on the Z11 study, they are leaning toward removing less nodes and like you said, let radiation take care of the rest. I had a sentinel node biopsy a week before my double mastectomy, and 2 out of 3 nodes were positive. I was told I was going to have an axillary dissection during mastectomy, but they only found two more nodes (which were negative). I just didn't have a lot of nodes, but much oncologist did say that chemo can destroy them. I guess my question is: did you actually have a sentinel node biopsy? It's all confusing and seems like you're getting conflicting info! I'm so sorry--that must be so frustrating! I do think they should have at least evaluated your sentinel nodes, and if they didn't, they should have! But then it almost sounds like they said they couldn't find any? Am I understanding this correctly?",

I think a lot of the stuff out there on the internet isn't helpful or accurate. I posted the RCB info in hopes to encourage Kattis, as she had clear nodes and likely the chemo killed some of her breast tumor. Just to remind her that she might have had a better response than she thinks! I agree it might not help others here. Not my intention, and can certainly delete that post if it's unhelpful. How is everyone else doing?",

Hard to believe it's been almost a year since I finished chemo. Seems eternal while you're going through it; but when I look back on it, it seems like a blur. As you would probably guess, the first several days after AC are the worst and then the second week you'll feel quite a bit better. I literally have notes on my phone of how I felt during each day of each round, so feel free to reach out to me if you want more details--I will be here to support you if it helps (feel free to PM me)!! Some tips: make sure you chew on ice during the entire AC infusion (and a little before and after). It really does help reduce mouth sores. Also buy Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash, and an extra soft toothbrush. Use regularly. Take the anti-nausea meds on a schedule, regardless of how you feel to stay on top of it. This will help ward off any nausea, and the drugs they prescribe really do a good job. It's much more effective to be preemptive than reactive to it. Get some nice natural lotions and lip balms and use regularly. And find some series to binge watch on Netflix! I also found that walking helped me feel better during treatment. You might not be up to it the first few days, but if I dragged myself out of bed and walked, it helped with my energy (I also read some studies that exercising during chemo makes it more effective...so a bonus!) With the nicer weather, some fresh air will feel great! Good luck, you'll do just fine! I will be looking out for your updates! I'm sorry you're going through this, but before you know it, this will be behind you. One day at a time!! Hugs    ",

I feel like a druggie shopping around and begging for more chemo! I received opinions from Rush, University of Chicago, Northwestern, and even got a remote second opinion from my sister's breast oncologist at Sloane Kettering. Consensus of no more chemo and Palbo trials. I'm sure I'll hear the exact same things at Mayo next week, and at that point I just need to close the book on other opinions and trust what these very smart doctors are telling me. They all say that the biggest weapon in our arsenal is the hormonal therapy (AIs)...but like you, I feel like we should still do more! The residual cancer is what really got me down and made me feel really scared (especially the nodes. Ugh). I had a \"clinical complete response:\" tumor and node no longer palpable and the pre-surgery scan was totally clear (could not see breast tumor anymore, even though it was still 1.4 cm). I just don't get it....how it seemed clinically that I had a great response, when in reality I didn't. I think mentally it would make everything seem so much more worth it if we had really good responses. But we didn't, so we have to figure out where to go from here. And yes, Hammie...I do feel that way about continuing treatment. I feel like you can tell they think we have rogue cancer cells traveling throughout our body (that's why we were treated so aggressively), and we know chemo didn't kill a significant amount of our tumors in breast and nodes--so why should we feel secure/confident that it killed the roaming cells? I'm with you; it's like we're just sitting and waiting for it to come back, where my philosophy is let's use any available treatment to try to destroy those cells before they organize somewhere! It feels so frustrating. I so wish we all had gotten really good responses from chemo and weren't in this situation.... but we all seem to be doing everything we can. Xyzeng, that's wonderful that you are getting both Ibrance and something similar to Xeloda! If I had the opportunity, that's exactly what I would do---but doesn't seem like many oncs here in the U.S. will prescribe Xeloda for ER+ and they definitely aren't willing to prescribe Ibrance outside of a trial setting. Happy for you that you have that opportunity. Man, do I hate cancer. The most awful part of it is going through all of this hell...months upon months...and no one being able to tell us we're cured or that we'll be okay. We can go through all of this and it can still come back. Hard to wrap my head around, and I struggle thinking about the future. I have four little girls and I just get so scared.....I hate thinking about the cancer \"what ifs\" and just want my life back. Sorry, don't mean to be a downer. I'm looking forward to hear about everyone's progress. Let's keep this thread going since many of us are on the same timeline in a similar situation. And please, others who had residual cancer after chemo, please share your story!! We'd love stories of hope and encouragement!",

I know I've taken every step possible to reduce whatever that risk is, and trying to find a sense of peace with that. That must have been a difficult conversation with your daughter. This is so hard on our families, too. And I think watching someone go through what we have, there's such a desperation that we're going to be okay. My girls are very young, so they have no idea what's going on. Easier in some ways, but harder because I need lots of time to see them grow up! And I agree about the scans. They cause so much anxiety, and the waiting and anticipation is torturous. Double-edged sword, I think. My staging scans showed a few things that needed to be followed, and I was a nervous wreck! Hammie, sounds like your team is being thorough. I've been seeing a cardiologist all throughout treatment. Adriamycin is so cardiotoxic, that I think it's important to stay on top of it. I think being proactive with this stuff is so important, and plus AIs have cardiovascular risks, too. It's a pain because it leads to more doctor's visits, but also gives peace of mind. And speaking of staging scans above, they saw a mass on my colon so I had to get a colonoscopy just days after diagnosis! It felt like such a kick in the pants. The procedure wasn't that bad...the prepping is no fun. 😳 I'm getting my DEXA scan on Thursday, so we'll see how that turns out. I'm going to ask for Prolia regardless of the results. Any of you on Prolia? If so, what are your thoughts? Anyway, everything about cancer is unfair. But we'll get through it! Hope to hear from others, too! We can all use stories of hope from long term survivors with residual disease! Please post to tell us how well you're doing! Hope everyone is having a good Sunday!",

I would just express your concerns about cardiac exposure. They did a 3D mapping for me to see if the breath hold technique would be successful in sparing my heart. If it wasn't, they were going to refer me for proton. And maybe google above because I certainly can't explain it well! It's so complicated!! ",

I think that's a really great prognostic indicator for you if the nodes were negative after chemo! They generally will only do an axillary dissection if there are positive sentinel nodes, and more recently, they are actually leaning toward removing less nodes and relying on radiation to kill remaining cells (Z11 study). So if I'm understanding correctly, I think this is really positive for you!! So the chemo must have killed the cancer in the node originally biopsied. Also, like you, I only had one lymph node originally biopsied for initial staging. Then after chemo, my SLN biopsy showed that 2/3 were positive. So during my mx, they took more nodes, but I only had 2 others. It sounds like everything was done as it should and it's so great they didn't find any cancerous nodes after chemo.",

My first thought is that you don't definitively know the pathology of your lymph nodes. At the very least, you need a sentinel node biopsy, but sounds like we're not sure how many nodes were removed? Would you consider sending all of your pathology slides elsewhere for an outside review? I think you have to know that information accurately in order to make decisions. If you truly had a negative sentinel node biopsy, then I think radiation would be fine. But obviously you must feel unsettled to get conflicting and confusing information. I'm so sorry!!

I had mine reviewed by Mayo just for peace of mind. Many other facilities offer it, including MD Anderson and Johns Hopkins. Anyway, if you truly are triple negative, there are many clinical trials and currently many MOs are offering 6 months to a year of Xeloda for residual disease after chemo (it seems that most are more willing if you're triple negative). Google the Create-X study. I know how scary this is. We all do. But try to hang onto hope and get the full picture of your situation and see what else might be available for you.

Was supposed to get ovaries removed on 9/16, but had complications so didn't happen. Getting Lupron injection on Thursday to start ovarian suppression. Looking forward to hearing what Mayo has to say next Tuesday. And I'm hoping your soreness gets better soon! So glad that's behind you. Although radiation was tedious, it was totally manageable (at least for me). Just continually slather yourself with whatever cream they give you. It seems to really help. I'm definitely going to enroll in a Palbo trial. Still a little torn about whether to do PENELOPE or PALLAS.",

As I said, my insurance would cover the surgery, and I know that many others without genetic mutations that had an oophorectomy were covered, as well. Agree that's probably the less expensive option versus monthly injections for 5-10 years. I'm only a week into Arimidex and feel okay. Just kind of waiting for the side effects to hit me...

If someone is young relative to breast cancer (in their 20s, 30s and 40s), usually genetic testing is recommended because the younger you are, the more suspicious it is that there's a genetic link. And then of course, family history weighs into it, which it sounds like you don't have. With that being said, it's usually a personal choice and obviously has social implications (like stress for yourself and your daughter, etc.). I had it done because my sister was diagnosed six years ago at her baseline mammogram at 40; however, we both tested negative (except I have a VUS on BRCA1 and she has one on ATM). I have met many woman who have a crazy strong family history of BC and tested negative, and others who have none and tested positive. Sometimes it seems like there's no rhyme or reason. I suspect there's a lot of mutations that cause BC that they just don't know about yet. I believe mine and my sister's is genetic, and whatever mutation that is responsible for it is yet to be discovered. She and I both plan to continue to follow up and be monitored with genetic counselors/blood tests. I have 4 little daughters and she has two teenage daughters. Not sure if any of this helps, but just my thoughts!! ",

I'm glad the article was helpful for you; it's actually the one that my oncologist gleaned the charts from that she provided me related to my recurrence risk. She told me that the RCB index is the best way to determine risk recurrence for those who did neoadjuvant chemo. She said there's obviously a lot of other statistics out there related to prognosis, but a lot of those are related to those who did surgery first. And I'm like you; I prefer to have all of the information and do my own research. There have been times when my \"digging\" has scared the crap out of me, but I'm just the type of person who wants to know what I'm dealing with. As far as diet, an excellent oncologist recommended the Mediterranean diet to me, and apparently there are studies to back it up. Plus I like Mediterranean food--I recently ordered a cookbook from amazon. I also drink a cup of Brassica green tea a day made by Johns Hopkins and made from broccoli sprouts. I drink the lemon flavor and it's not too bad. Studies have shown that this can help ward off recurrence. Who knows,but I certainly feel better trying to be healthy. But believe me, I have many moments of still eating unhealthy foods, but working on it. ",

If I had a PCR, I would have had so much more confidence going forward. I just pray that the \"stray cells\" were much more vulnerable than an organized tumor mass. I don't know...but I totally relate. I wish there was more we could do! I would take more chemo in a heartbeat!!",

So I imagine any remaining cancer taken later if the margins weren't clear would also be included, but I'm not sure if/how re-excisions would be calculated. As far as sentinel node biopsy, it would be done if that biopsy was done after chemo. If done before, I don't think they could do a RCB calculation if cancerous nodes were taken before chemo. Hope this makes sense Anyway, I'm certainly no expert, but this is my understanding.",

I think most people start between 1-2 months after surgery. Yes, there are standard of care guidelines (I don't know exactly what the exact time period is), but a month isn't too long, so I wouldn't worry yet. Do you have a tentative date to start rads? As far as hormonal therapy, I didn't start ovarian suppression and AI until a few weeks after rads ended. I do know women who started hormonal therapy after surgery and during rads. My doctor prefers to do only one treatment at a time. Hope this helps.",

I guess, in a way, enrolling in a trial like this can stunt us mentally. I mean, most people are walking away from active treatment...and over the past couple months, I've tried to get back to life and mentally move forward. Being in a trial and dealing with low blood counts and being worried about getting sick (for possibly two years!!?) will be tough mentally. I want so desperately to move away from cancer. WIth that being said, it does seem promising and is potentially a great opportunity. But it's scary to take a drug for so long without knowing the residual long term effects.

Ironically, I just read an article about that drug, and know that it received FDA approval for stage IV. Don't think it's approved for stage III, or if any oncologists would prescribe it. Hope everyone is doing well and that you have a great weekend!!",

It's just so disappointing when you think you had a great response, to only find out that chemo didn't do as much as we'd hope. Obviously, it wouldve been better prognostically if we had a complete response; but from what I'm told, that's fairly uncommon for strongly ER+ patients. I've been told by several, reputable MOs that hormonal therapy is our best defense. Lily2, congrats on a complete response. Amazing news!! Ajbclan, sorry I missed your post somehow! I'm sorry to hear about blood work. What did your doctor say? My levels have been low since chemo, too. Starting to think it's just my new normal. Gocancergo, thanks for sharing! Interesting that your PR level was lower after chemo, too!",

I had very brief and transient tingling in like a finger during a treatment, but it resolved very quickly. It honestly was a breeze for me compared to AC. I have also heard that the weekly regimen reduces side effects, so I imagine it's different for everyone. The obvious advantage to the 4 cycles is being done quicker and less visits. I just worry that they've learned it's more effective, but I haven't seen any direct comparison studies. I know they've compared weekly to every three weeks (and weekly had the edge), but I don't believe they've compared weekly versus biweekly. Anyway, thanks for your response and please keep me posted on what your MO says!  ",
