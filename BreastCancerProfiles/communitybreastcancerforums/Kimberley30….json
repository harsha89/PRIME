Why do I have to go thru something so terminal to be loved and get attention?? I want to know as well, when do you fall out of the denial stage. I am getting my whole breast removed, and I requested an implant right after. My nipple has cancer so that has to go for sure!! How do you go on after this? I am a single mother w/ 2 kids. How am I going to meet my special someone when I feel mutulated??",

I am a non smoker, with noone in my family that has had cancer. my Dr has no clue where this came from. I had atleast 7 mamagrams, and 1 biopsy before it was detected. I started to bleed from my nipples, that is what made me notice it, and bring the issue to the doctors.  My Dr has now told me I need to have my breast removed, and get reconstructive surgery. I am trying sooooooooooooo hard not to break down and cry. I am trying to smile as though I wasnt just told this. I guess the reason for this site is to hear how other people are coping & dealing.  I hope and pray that we all with get through this from the help of God, our families & friends. May God bless us all!! Love Kim",

I have had so many mamagrams and a biopsy. She is a GREAT surgeon, and I trust her quite well. She did my biopsy, and is very throuogh with me. I am hearing impaired, so she draws the issue for me, to ensure I understand. I feel like I can trust her opionion! Thanks for the feedback ladies, it is always amazing to hear someones in take!!",
