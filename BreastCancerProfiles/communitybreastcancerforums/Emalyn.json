I have a baby grandchild.  Being a bit older than many of you helps me cope.  My children got to grow up with mom.  Still, this is plenty traumatic.  Big cyber hugs to all of you. Emalyn ",

Since I was expecting to stumble out afterwards in a daze, nauseous and exhausted, I was surprised to feel normal. So far today, continue to feel normal. I know side effects will likely kick in sometime during the next few days or so. Taking this one day at a time, now is good.   ",
