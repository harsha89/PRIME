I've kept the majority of my top lashes but the bottom ones were few and far between. I started using mascara last week and I have lots of new little ones on the bottom. In regard to the hair my final chemo was Oct 16 but I had a job interview on Oct 26 so I shaved my head that morning to ensure there were no scraggly hairs around. I have about 3/4 inch of hair now, and two distinct bald spots, one of which I never knew I had on the crown. It's about the size of a quarter and is not filling in but hopefully when the hair comes in longer I can comb it over. I have my first haircut set for Wednesday to even it up since the sides are longer than the back and front, AND one side is longer than the other :-)",

Today is the second anniversary of my first chemo treatment, and my youngest brothers 43rd Birthday. I hope that someday i disassociate the two. In the meantime I have about 6 inches of hair. I've had few trims and can ALMOST get it into a french braid that will stay tucked in.. the curls are far tighter than they were pre chemo so it's an adjustment...

The overall changes from pre chemo are the increase in the tightness of the curls, but an overall thinning of my hair. My hairdresser who've I have been going to since about 2001 tells me that it's as thick as it ever was but the texture is far finer. I would agree with that. I'm happy to have it, and happy to be symptom free going into my third year post treatment. All the best to all of you this Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanza or which ever holiday you may celebrate.   ",

Nah, I have coloured my hair for a long time so I'm not sure what the natural colour would have been...a reddish brown of some sort if I could have tolerated it. That said, the first growth after chemo was that fine white whispy hair that I think most of us get. Those little baby hairs trying to grow back from the folicles getting over the shock of the chemo. I actually shaved most of them off for a job interview and then let it grow in after... it came in brown salt and peppery in about February/March. I've since coloured it.",

My surgeon was a general surgeon at CVH as well, but highly recommended. Even though they are called general surgeons, they do have areas where they specialize in. My surgeon is highly involved with the cancer center, and with breast cancers in particular. I think you'll be in good hands there. Surgeons can differ from the opinions of radiologists because they have hands on experience with patients who have similar diagnosis to what you've got. The surgeon would know from their experience and the experiences of their peers what is most likely to be the reality. Radiologist can only tell you what the pictures 'look like or appear to be'. But they wouldn't have the same experience or feedback as the surgeons would. Does that make sense?

Our husbands are close and talk all the time. My husband told me yesterday ( I think they feel it is better to come from my husband I guess) that the most recent scans revealed my friends cancer has metastisized to the liver, lung, bone sand chest wall. Of course they are very upset, and I am at a loss to know what to say or do, or feel. She is such a young woman, with an 8 year old daughter. I am very sad. But I am also very optimistic. Research has come a long way and we are surviving longer and longer with much better QOL. Thank you for listening",
