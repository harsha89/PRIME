When I went in to put on my shirt I was tempted to just sit on the bench and have a nap. By the time I was home and had a cup of tea I was able to carry on my day. I hit the wall the last week of the big treatments, had a couple of couch days but have felt since those are finished. The only SE bothering me now is the peeling skin and my shoulder/arm is stiffer. I think mentally knowing that we will be finished treatments goes a long way to making you feel better. Good luck and stay well!",

I just finished 8 rounds of dose dense chemo and had what they called a complete clinical response. I was N1 going in to surgery with possibly three positive nodes and came out of surgery with 8 plus a lot of residual disease. Not happy as I was expecting much better results.  Stressed to the max at the moment but I am going to get on with the treatment. One foot in front of the other and one day at a time is about all we can do. I just don't get how they miss all this during the neo-adj chemo??",

A) They can monitor if the chemo regimen that they are giving you is working by measuring the tumour to see if it is shriniking, this gives the option of changing the drugs if the tumour stays the same size or progresses. This allows them to be more effective in combating micro-metastis B) If the tumour shrinks up then there is the option of breast conservation surgery. C) It does mean that you have to live with the cancer in you for a longer period of time and you never really get a totally clear prognosis due to what the chemo has cleared out before surgery. It is often done at locally advanced breast clinics such as the one at Princess Margaret Hosptal.You many want to check that PMH out for a second opinion. Hope this helps, TO",

      "Content": "Jan 9, 2009 04:17PM - edited Jan 9, 2009 04:20PM by Toronto_012 Hi, I am also Stage 3 A. Just finishing my second last chemo- Epirubicin and Docetaxel (hope I spelled that correctly). My tumour was 5 cm and I had 3 suspicious nodes before neo-adjuvant chemo. The tumour is now almost totally gone meaning that the chemo is working well and the nodes are undetectable clinicaly. I am scheduled for a lumpectomy and 25 rounds of radiation, bisphosphonates and tamoxifin. My Onc has told me that I can be cautiausly optimistic so you can be too! They have a lot of big guns to fight this stuff with so do not be stressed out by the stats because they do not include the new taxane drugs. Always speak to your doctor if you feel really anxious from what you read on the internet. It was causing me to have a melt down! Good luck and God Bless! p.s. My best tip for chemo is to make sure to take stool softeners and sentokote! 1 day before and 3 days after to clear the drugs.",
