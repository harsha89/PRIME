I had a bilateral breast reduction last July and routine post-op pathology revealed dcis in the left breast. The compulsory pre-op mammogram showed a small area of benign calcification - it wasn't benign.  I've experienced a prolonged healing journey since the reduction - severe fat necrosis, wound dehiscence due to infections / inflammation - both breasts have had problems but the left one worse. Since early September I've had 2 mammograms, mri scan and ultrasound which have shown 'normal post-op appearance' for the left breast.  These scans and the pathology tissue have been sent for second opinions and the diagnosis is that there was 1cm grade 3 dcis (comedo necrosis) with no invasion.  As your BS says, margin status is unknown due to the way the breast is reconstructed in a reduction.  The recommendation from my BS (who did the original reduction surgery) is that either mastectomy or radiotherapy would be valid, depending on the level of recurrence risk I want to take. I'm not sure what to do.  I've been leaning towards radiotherapy but unable to proceed due to delayed healing.   Now I'm moving towards mastectomy, given the problems I've had and the greater reduction in risk of recurrence, especially with high grade dcis.  I'm also concerned that a lot of time has passed since the diagnosis and I'm not convinced that this is okay, despite the various scan results and reassurance from the BS. Have you been given any more information on the nature of the dcis that was found?   ",

Radiotherapy isn't done on a breast with an open wound.  It's at the T-zone which opened during later infection/swelling.  I had the Wise procedure for HH breasts (I waited many, many years for this and it sure didn't feel cosmetic, it felt essential, though elective!).   I don't want to take tamoxifen (or other hormone-impacting drugs) and my BS has agreed that the potential for risk reduction in my case does not merit the potential downsides. Is radiotherapy/hormone therapy an alternative that you've been offered or would consider?Radiotherapy became more of an option for me following the results of the recent mammograms, mri and ultrasound as well as the second opinion on the pathology.  But the degree of risk anyone is prepared to tolerate is very personal with this kind of choice. I'm happy to share some stuff here if you are - as you say, this sequence of events is not common and it might be helpful to anyone else in the same boat searching for others with this experience.  You probably know about Wanda Sykes choosing a bmx following a diagnosis of dcis after her breast reduction earlier this year.",
