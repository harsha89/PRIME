So I'm finally through the bulk of treatment for IDC starting at 34 years old (double mastectomy with 3 nodes positive, chemo - ACT, radiation, herceptin, and currently taking Tamoxifen for 5 years) and chemo shut down my ovaries.  This was great news since my cancer was ER+.  Unfortunately, my body has recovered and my doc suggested trying Lupron in addition to Tamoxifen to shut down my ovaries.  My problem is that the side effects from the first shot of Lupron are really bad for me - dizziness, nausea, bone/joint pain, extreme fatigue, crazy making insomnia, terrible nightmares - along with the usual hot flashes of menopause.  Has anyone else tried Lupron and not been able to handle the side effects?  Does it get better after the first shot or is the same each time you get the shot?  Or worse? Did you decide to try another medication or have your ovaries removed or just let the Tamoxifen take care of whatever estrogen eating cancer cells floating around your body? My dilema is quality of life (which is currently terrible) versus risk of recurrence.  I have two young kids (ages 2 and 5) that I am trying to do everything to reduce risk of recurrence so that I can be here with them as long as possible.  But right now I feel so terrible that I can't be the kind of mom I want to be to them.  I don't know what to do.  Any advice please?",

Hope everyone has a good day. -Chewy",
