She told me confidently that it was fiberadenoma. I was still quite freaked out. She suggested me to have a core needle biopsy if that bothered me so much. After the test, the results showed that it was a fiberadenoma. Because that lump hurt me so much, I decided to get rid of it. Everything went fine after that. Then after a year, which is one month prior to this, I casually did a self examination on my breast and I noticed there's a lump too. (OK, this time I am not freaked out at all.) I went to the doctor yesterday. She checked and found that the lump is movable. This time, she's quite confident that it's also fiberadenoma. She told me to monitor it for a month. Right after my period, she suggested me to stop drinking coffee or any caffeine drinks, and no chocolate and peanuts. Then, for the next cycle, try to see if that lump shrinks or not. I am going to give this a try. If it does not shrink, I am thinking of getting rid of it. I am a coffee drinker, I feel like this can be one of the reason for it.Â  However, after reading tunkylala's comment, I am starting to freak out. I feel like maybe I should also get a biopsy. You never know what's gonna happen! :(",
