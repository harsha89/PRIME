They tell me 1 treatment every three weeks for 6 treatments of that combination, then 1 treatment every three weeks of Herceptin for 1 year. Supposed to also go thru some radiation treatments along the way. So scary. So much information to take in. My son and his girlfriend are walking in the NYC Walk for Breast Cancer too. That was planned even before I received my diagnosis. Thanks for responding to my post. It helps when you can listen to other's experiences. Hope all is going well for you.",

Had lumpectomy with 9 lymph nodes removed. Six came back testing positive. Will be starting chemo in a few weeks, followed by radiation. Am scared. Some days up, some days down. Will definitely be following this site to see how everyone gets thru this. ",
