I'm 46 years old and have had regular mammograms for the past 5 years. 2 years ago I had an abnormal mammogram that revealed calcifications (not clustered) and two cysts found via ultrasound, all on the left breast. No further testing or treatment recommended. Approximately 3 months ago out of the same breast while in the shower doing a self exam I gently squeezed the nipple and dark reddish brown discharge came out of a the nipple of the left breasts but only out of a specific area. Have occassional burning sensation on left breast toward arm pit and upper left side of breast. 2 weeks later made it into the doctor who did a diagnostic mammogram which revealed no change in calcifications and nothing more. The doctor was able to express the dark reddish brown discharge but did no testing that day. Instead set up appointment for a ductogram. I did not follow thru with the ductogram because the dark reddish brown discharge has stopped and only dark green and not out of the same area on the nipple.Â Should I still be concerned and reschedule the test?
