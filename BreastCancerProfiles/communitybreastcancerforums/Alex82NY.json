My mom was just diagnosed with Stage 1A breast cancer back in November, had a double mastectomy followed by immediate reconstruction and all pathology came back stating that no lymph modes were compromised and tumor was very small- she is practically cured/cancer free. She is starting to see the oncologist for the first time with some treatment options to make sure all cancer cells are eliminated (which I just posted about in the Just Diagnosed board). I was extremely nervous, but let me tell you Rosie that breast cancer treatments have come such a long way and strides are made every day. I know it's scary and a hard pill to swallow as it was for my mom (age 56), my family, and I (her son). You will be fine and will say a little prayer for you for good heath and so you can feel at ease. Alex",
