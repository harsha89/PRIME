I'm also skeptical of clean nodes.  I think they can take 1000 slices of one node but only take a sample.  Also, I was told I had clean nodes but when I sent the slides for a second opinion they interpreted it different and said I had a micromet.  This is all so subjective it's unbelievable.  Pathologists argue about such things.  So I really don't take \"clean nodes\" as anything written in stone.  Anyway, there are still many nodes left in the body.   This disease is such a sneaky miserable thing.  I've never liked uncertainty but i have to learn to live with it, there is just no alternative.  I once said to an onco at a major hospital \"I just hope I live to see a cure.\" She said \"Lots of women are cured of breast cancer every day!\"  What a nice thought!",

And we won't have the same choices.  The government will have the power to decide since they will be footing the bill. Chemo is very expensive.  Each infusion cost over $3000.

They found lymphovascular invasion and a micromet in one node.  I had been told I had neither,  She said I should have chemo.  She said that if I was in my 70's she might not think so but at 62 I could live another 30 years and that gives it time to come back.  Also, the tumor was over 2 cm.  That was the old cut off I think for chemo. Also, she said the Ai's have only been in use for 6 years.  It takes decades to know what will really happen.  She suggested CMF, chemo lite, which she said has been studied forever and leaves no permanent side effects.  It would give me a 3% advantage over arrimidex alone. I decided to do the chemo.  It was doable.  Not fun but not incapacitating.  I didn't even lose my hair!  But i can see why they try to avoid giving it.  I'm still not myself, 8 months out. April 15 I went on arrimidex and at first it was fine.  But after a few months the pains became unbearable.  It also made me cry all of the time.  Terrible fatigue, depression.  It's not that easy to \"pop a pill\" sometimes. So about 3 weeks ago I went off of the arrimidex.  The Sloan onco said I may be one of those who can't tolerate it.  She said \"at least you had chemo\".  But she never said the other drs were wrong not to suggest it.  She said they MAY have been right.  No one knows the \"answer\".  The whole thing is fraught with uncertainty and I think making the decisions were the hardest part of the journey.

There is obviously a genetic component.  An environmental component. I've heard that the further away from the equator the higher the incidence of both BC and Multiple Sclerosis because of the lack of vitamin D.  But according to the map there is still plenty of incidence in warm climates. My onco nurse at Sloan was from St. Vincent in the carribbean.  She said that there is a lot of breast cancer there.  They are out in the sun all day and eat fresh fruits and vegetables and fish from the sea.  But still, a lot of BC.  She said the difference is that there is no care.  They don't go to the dr, they don't know they have it until its too late.  Many cases are not reported and most go untreated.",

I will be on CMF for 6 months.  So far 2 of the 3 weeks of the cycle is not bad.  I still have hair although it's getting thin.  I am tired.  But it's the first week that is the roughest.  One dr tells me I will only get 1% advantage from the chemo.  The Sloan dr said 3% possibly.  But bottom line, no one knows.",

Yes, my gut and common sense wanted to get rid of all breast tissue but my surgeon, head of the breast center at U of Chicago, fought my decision vehemently. I settled for the one mastectomy. But get this...she suggested I talk to an onco psychiatrist \"so that you will make a rational decision based on fact\". In other words, it was irrational of me to want a mastectomy. Luckily the place was disorganized enough that they never got back to me. I had no idea that the statistics for lumpectomy recurrence were higher. BS was quite adamant about \"survival\" being the same. She was so dogmatic about it that raised a red flag to me though. In science, an open mind and the recognition of the element of the unknown should always be there, I also did not want radiation if it was not necessary. I asked her, \"doesn't radiation cause cancer?\" She dismissed that one too, \"only rarely\". I almost felt that it was politically correct to try to save women's breasts as a protest against male domination! It had that feel to it. You VILL keep your breast! I never like my breast in the first place and at 64 and married 45 years, I could not care less! Your post is very validating to me. I had the surgery at chicago but went to Sloan for a second opinion. They found things that Chicago did not. But what i appreciated most about the onco there was that she did not speak in absolutes. She was very open about the lack of certainty. She questioned, doubted and left it to me to decide while urging me to be as aggressive as possible. That's why I trusted her. She never said she was right, she said others may be right too, I just wish I'd gone to Sloan first, for the surgery. They found the micromet and might have removed my nodes and the other breast.. Second opinions, always second opinions! Always go to the best! I cannot get over this new info. I thought I'd read it all! Thank you Mimi, the world makes a little more sense now, thanks to you.",

Anyway, Sloan said they do not go back in to remove lymph nodes. I don't know why. They did not recommend radiation but did recommend CMF chemo, chemo \"lite\" they called it, just as a precaution. I was estrogen positive so I'm on Arrimidex now. It is good to hear that all of your other nodes were clear. I don't really understand why they wouldn't take mine out but I'm hoping for the best. None of this is cut and dried, apparently. Good luck!",

The universe was saying to me \"See!  It wasn't the end.  Even the drs can be wrong.  Don't give up hope.\" I absolutely could not tell them what was going on with me.  I knew it would ruin their day.   I just don't want to inflict this on anyone else.  It's just a reminder to everyone what can be in store for them the next day or the next.  Once my hair has grown back and I'm feeling a bit better it will be different, I hope. But right now I want to protect myself from their sad looks and protect them from that sadness.  But now I'm wondering if I've hurt their feelings by my avoidance?  ",

BTW, initially I did get 3 opinions.  Sloan said no chemo.  Anderson said no chemo.  She was the only one who said \"chemo\".  Then I went back to sloan and the onco there changed her opinion and said \"chemo, all 6\".  So I went back to my local onco and here I am.  I'm really at a loss and you are so right, I am in a dark place and I don't trust myself to decide.  Of course I want to feel better, physically.  But I want to do the right thing for the long run.  Something she has been pressuring me NOT to do.   Thanks for the support.",

I don't want to be around people too much because all I do is complain and I'm sick of hearing it myself. Thursday i'm flying to New York for a post op with my surgeon at Sloan.  I'm am on the verge of panic about it. I can't imagine walking through the airport.  I'm petrified he may find something.  My nerves are totally frayed and I've run out of courage.  An occasional xanax helps if I feel I'm really losing it.   It's hard to explain this to anyone, not that it makes a difference.  It's just this feeling that the well has run dry. But I have to find more courage...what other choice is there? Possible causes?  NO estrogen.  Antibiotics.  Chemo misery.  AI's.  Inactivity.  Boredom.  Fatigue that is so debilitating that there is no motivation to DO anything.  Any other ideas? Rosebud, your post came after mine and I just read it.  Yes, no hair!  lol  I study my head every day trying to see more hair than there is.  I hate the bald head.  OTH, it's objective evidence of what is going on inside.

I think it's to prevent nausea but she said it can make you feel better all around.   Taxol allergy can be bad.  I wonder if that has something to do with it?  they give me a lot of benedryl because rarely people can stop breathing from the allergy.  they cut back the dose on the second infusion but I made them aware that I had some itching between my toes and fingers, even with the big dose of benedryl so they did not cut back the dose the second time around.  actually, they did but I reminded them so they didn't.  I find I have to watch them very carefully.  I've caught mistakes like that every time. I'm having an awful day in spite of it being week 3.  We went out for Greek food last night and it did not go down well.  I wound up taking a couple of dulcolax and a couple of prunes and OMG, the whole day I've had terrible cramps.   I so know how you feel about quitting chemo!  I'm counting the days...89 to go for 6 infusions.  The dr did mention the possibility of cutting it to 3 infusions which would mean this Monday would be the last.  I really feel between a rock and a hard place.  The fear of those nasty cells vs the fear of these side effects.  No fun at all! 1",

My bladder control is awful too.  I hope it improves after chemo but I don' t think it will go back to normal and that will entail more treatments, ugh. The aches and pains are horrid and for three days I was on hydrocodone, round the clock.  Then yesterday, I realized I was really feeling depressed and out of it.  I looked up side effects of hydrocodone and eureka, that's where i was.  I decided to endure the pain but I had to take an ativan to get to sleep.  That was the best thing I did because I slept for 10 hours straight and woke up a different person.  there is no way to overestimate the need for sleep. My neuropathy is pretty constant now but as it's not yet been a week since my third infusion I'm hopeful it will ease up soon. It all sucks.  be easy on yourself.  I know it's hard but we really have to lower our expectations at this difficult time.  ",

I told her I liked science.  Anyway, out of desperation I've been taking it.  On the label it says it has al lot of disclaimers.   Even Dr Oz is recommending untested remedies.  It's getting hard to know the difference.",

So here I am, after sleeping all day and night from total exhaustion, and I'm sick at heart.  What to do? I've never had a dr like this before.  She changes her mind so many times!  And in a way, I think that may be because she cares.  But how can I make the decision?  She even asked my husband what he thought. That annoyed him, how should he know?  All we know is that I've been through an awful lot.  And I asked about that sixth dose of carboplatin and how dangerous it is.  She said it can happen at any time but more often after the sixth.   Anyway, this is not a nice way to end chemo.  she wants to see me in 3 months, to see if the tumor markers (the meaningless ones) go up.  I have an app with my surgeon at Sloan in September and I'm glad of that.

But what a great photo, of those busted balloons, I feel it's for all of us. What is hitting me now is fear.  I think as long as I was under treatment I felt I was doing what I had to do. Now I'm not so sure and it's scary to be waiting and seeing what happens next.",

I spent 3 hours today with an onco nurse with 30 years experience.  Amazing.  My hospital has a program to help you transition out of treatment.  Too much information for me to remember off hand but I do remember her saying that losing just 5 or 10 pounds will lower rate of recurrence.  Also, of course, walking a half hour a day.  Turns out I have osteoporosis now so it's double the reason to walk.  She asked if I take calcium and I said I stopped about a year ago when that study came out saying that calcium pills don't work.  She said that was for most people, people with osteo must take it.  Hard to keep track!

It was a great catharsis though and I felt so much better afterward.   My onco nurse finally got back to me and told me I couldn't have the sixth infusion.  I give up.  I have such pain in my feet that it's probably for the best but I don't see why they took this attitude.   Yesterday a different  onco (I have two) explained that because of my osteoporosis I need to have IV infusions of some drug that can cause necrosis of the jaw if I have a problem in my mouth.  So I have to wait until all of the chemo is out of me, then I have to go to the dentist and make sure I have no dental problems and then have the infusion.  Hmm, I may be repeating myself... But the point is, today I have a toothache!  lol  How on earth did that happen? I haven't had a toothache in a long time but now that I'm scared of any dental problems, I have one.   Maybe I'm grinding my teeth from all of the tension!",

I'm so glad you made the switch. I did not have a Pet scan.  I had a micromet in one nodewith my bc. They considered that node negative which makes no sense to me but they say that micromets don't effect prognosis  At Sloan they told me they don't do ct scans or any tests unless there are symptoms as too much radiation is dangerous. I just had my CT scan here in Chicago.  They did everything differently than Sloan did.  Honestly no two places are alike.  At Sloan I heard they were going to more MRIs than Ct scans.   About loyalty to drs.  I'm remembering when my children's pediatrician got sick.  I loved him. I considered him the third parent.  Everyone left his practice and I thought I would stay and be loyal.  Until I went to the pharmacy to fill a prescription for my son.  The pharmacist looked at it in  horror and said \"Dr. Shultz wrote this, right?\"  I said yes.  He said it was written for the wrong dose.  He'd been doing that a lot.  Of course this is a different situation, your doctor was good.  But I know the pain of having to leave a dr.   ",

The BIG news!  the onco thinks 3 infusions are enough!!!!  She says I'm DONE!  What a surprise! She said that's the norm at her hospital.  I asked about the data of 3 infusions vs 6 and she said there was none.  That makes me nervous.  OTH, after my near fainting episode, I had come to the conclusion myself that enough is enough.  She said I should deal with that with my internist.  She said anything is possible with chemo but she was doubtful that the chemo caused it.  If not for you girls on here I would think it never happened to anyone before! We went out to celebrate with a dinner and then I came home and quickly went to sleep.  Just woke up after 2 hours.  I can't believe I'm done!   What do you guys think?  I feel I'm between a rock and a hard place really.  If it recurrs I'll really kick myself for not having done all 6 infusions.  OTH, this is my second go round with chemo and it seems to be hurting me, what good is getting rid of the cancer if the rest of you is demolished?",

I was just making a follow up app at Memorial Sloan Kettering and the clerk was so fast, so efficient she took my breath away.  Before I could find my app in my app book she found it and told me what to do.  It's as though everyone there is on a caffeine high.  Then I talked to my local hospital and she was so clueless! She told me I hadn't seen my onco since Oct.  I told her I knew I had because my hysterectomy was Jan 29 and I discussed it with him.  She insisted that I had not been there since oct!!!!  How stupid can you be? And these are the people I am charging with my life? Twice they have given me an iodine drink when I've told them repeatedly that I am allergic to iodine. I feel as though I am on my own.  The first infusion they didn't tell me to take the morning steroids. I called the day before to make sure and the dr didn't mention it either.  When I went in the next morning the nurse was angry at ME for not taking them.  She called later and told me she had told me.  I have her message on my answering machine, no mention of morning steroids! I'm sure we all could go on with these kinds of stories but bottom line, you have to watch out for yourself. Sloan isn't perfect but  SO much better! I have a CT scan in the morning... prayers appreciated!!!",

I just got back from infusion #4.  The dr tried to talk me out of it.  They only give 3, I'm still not sure why, except that chemo does beat up your body and this is my second time around. The surprise...I tested positive for Lynch Syndrome. The test was not definitive and I need follow up. Lynch syndrome is a genetic disorder that increases the chance of of many cancers.  It was the dr at Anderson who told me I needed the test, no one else.  Having had both breast and endometrial cancer, it was good advice to get tested.  The worst part...my kids have a 50/50 chance of having it too.",

BTW, I don't know if her father is in the picture but my husband was awful and supported her immature behavior.  I really had it out with him and he's turned around too.  Last Monday he actually dragged her down to the infusion room, insisting that she see what's going on.  I would never have done that but I was unconscious!  They left quickly.  But it hurts my heart, in spite of everything, to think that she had to see me like that.  Still, her behavior has improved 1000%!",
