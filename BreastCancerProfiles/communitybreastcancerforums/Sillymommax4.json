I am on both sides of the fence on this I want him to tell me that this is nothing just a pulled muscle lol then I want him to do the biopsy and tell me it is still nothing so I can get on with things.  Still no support from hubby nothing new there he has had his head in the sand since July. I really need to know what this is so I can tell my kids and I would really love to tell them I had a lump it is now gone and was nothing at all to worry about. But if Cancer does raise its ugly little head I need to tell them that too. 4 months of this waiting is enough!  Thanks for letting me vent. Silly Log in to post a reply",
