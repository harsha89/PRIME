My previous experience with chemotherapy was back in 1978 and it is a world of difference now with all the support I am getting and the drugs for anti nausea and vomiting work fine. No vomiting and very little nausea that is manageable. I have several good days every couple of weeks. And that is good news too. I am surprised and happy with the results so far. And hopeful that my blood work will hold up and we can stay on track. Love to all, And thanks for your support in this. Dolly",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2014 08:56PM - edited Aug 12, 2014 10:00PM by lethe I was diagnosed after bilateral mastectomy surgery Aug 1 as stage IV. Earlier that week  we found out it was triple negative and grade 3. I can have chemo, and will be talking to my oncologist about that on Monday. Just came from the radiation team, and unfortunately my husband was shocked and surprised that I was actually stage IV.  I tried to let him know, but was probably too vague, I said that it's fast growing, and not a good prognosis, but I hadn't said \"stage 4\" to him because I hadn't had anyone say it out loud to me yet. I just thought it was 4 from my understanding of the path report. I wanted a doctor to tell us directly. What did him in was the radiation team talking about possible side effects and he suddenly realized how rotten things have gotten. I am so sad I made my husband cry.  I just need to say it out loud somewhere. We haven't told any family members yet. Keeping it light. \"just breast cancer, just surgery, just chemo\"  Thanks, sorry I'm not usually such a mess,  I don't really know what I want from the group yet. Dolly",

      "Content": "Sep 1, 2014 11:40PM - edited Sep 2, 2014 01:01AM by lethe Sorry to be so slow to respond.  I was supposed to start dose dense ACT on Fri, but they cancelled chemo last week, and the doctors are regrouping because the pet scan showed another problem in the parotid salivary gland. I go for a biopsy tomorrow on that. Talking about possible more surgery. Maybe to get the rest of the lymph nodes, mammary and clavicle both sides, which showed problems on the pet scan also. What put me into stage 4 was I had breast cancer in the left breast, (not the right breast) but the all the lymph nodes they sampled from the right side also had breast cancer. So it's contralateral axillary metastasis. Unusual problem. Anyway. for the most part I'm good at waiting, generally, and taking one day at a time is second nature by now. I had Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 25,  then thyroid cancer, now this breast cancer (both secondary cancers were caused by treatment for hodgkin's all those years ago). I have lots of problems due to hodgkin's.  I'm 62 now and mostly just worn out tired, and want to be out of here as gracefully as possible. I know it sounds wrong but there it is. Maybe that will change. I'm willing to listen and take my doctor's advice. That's as far as I can go. Dolly",
