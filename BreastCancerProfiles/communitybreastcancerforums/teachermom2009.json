I go tomorrow and just needing some advice. I got my report/images today to take with me and here's what it states. BiRads-3 Recommend follow up in 6 months Breast heterogenously dense that may obscure masses Breast tissue asymmetry found, follow up in 6 months to reasses the degree of assymetry. I'm not really sure what make of all of this. I read that a Birads 3 is actually a controversial score to begin with, but that some are considered for biopsy. Should I push for one? Do my findings look concerning? Thanks in advance. Log in to post a reply",
