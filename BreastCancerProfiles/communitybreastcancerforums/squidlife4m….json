I know its stressful.  Hang in there.",

I looked at the radiologist puzzled and asked if they were going to numb it first.. apparently the concerned look on my face showed I was a bit scared.. they all started giggling and said OF COURSE we are.  I thought I was going to vomit, seriously.  How could they forget that?!?!  LOL.  Perhaps its just an assumption.. but it IS military medicine.. we have to triple check.   I am having it done at a MTF.  At their breast health clinic.  I have a message into them, as well as my pcm to get xanax, valium, ativan, or whatever.  I always hate asking about that stuff because I dont want them to think I am a pill popper.  I am far the opposite.     I have not had the ductagram done yet, as they couldnt determine what exactly the mass is.  They told me if it does turn out the be the papilloma then they will do the duct a gram.  The discharge is green and sticky but no odor...  does that mean anything in particular?       I have not had any bloodwork done as of late.  I think depending on the results he will go from there.       With the DCIS (is that the right acronym...) is there usually pain associated with it?  My breast often is very tender.  I always chalk it up to the fact that my twins seem to think its the perfect pillow for their boney little elbows,  but recently they've been more tender .. another reason I was also concerned.   The lump is not dimpled and feeling it, you cannot feel any defined edges.  They said due to where it is in the tissue of the breast they are not surprised.      Not sure if that makes any difference.  Any other advice.  I will bring my Ipod.. that is a good idea.  I am not sure I want to hear the chatter either,  though they were quite the comedic group.    My husband will be joining me as well as my sister, and my friend.   I am worried about not being able to drive home.. not because of the pain, but because I literally vomit at the thought of the needle.  I am a big pansy..  I know.  I have NO idea how I ever had kids!! LOL  Thank you ladies for your advice and input <3",
