Over the last year I have spoken to a fnumber of doctors about it and they all tell everything is fine and telll me to take painkillers.  There are not willing to refer me back to Brest Clinic as they are happy with the fribrocystic breast diagnosis.  Am I being paranoid or should I be pushing for more tests? I would be really grateful for any advice?  Many thanks.  Maisie x Log in to post a reply",
