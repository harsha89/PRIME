After a series of chemo, radiation, and cobalt therapies, she was well and had a very healthy recovery with Tamoxifen as a daily chemo maintenance. She still continued her teaching career but retired immediately in 2004 at the age of 60. She did so many voluntary works after retirement. She served as Chairman of the Catholic Pastoral Council in our community--managing several church activities and projects. Aming her achievments were the re-building of the chapel thru donated funds she sought from different people, putting-up of the youth choir, settling the title of the chapel lot and its boundaries, and generating increased people support to the chapel. She also served as chaiirman of the Board of Directors of our town's multi-pupose cooperative and also of many volunteer groups. Her breast CA recurred in August 2010 (now stage IV) with multiple bone metastases. She was told her cancer got resistant to Tamoxifen. It was replaced with Xeloda and was also given Bondronat for the bone mets. She was still well into January 2011 when she had few mets in  liver but was immediately contained. Though it's already stage 4, we still had high  hopes she'll still have a longer life. In February, she felt shortnesss of breath. She was diagnosed with pleural effusion. At the Philippine General Hospital-Cancer Institute she was placed with a tube to drain off water which was malignant. She went well again but after pleurodisys, her shortness of breath returned. The water came back.  She was again placed with a tube.  The onc changed her Xeloda with Femara to control the pleural effusion. Mama never regained her health again.  She had issues with her bone marrow. Her platelets were down to 14 and 11, so we had to have many transfusions.  Im early April, no more water is seen in her lungs which has now fully expanded. But the pulmo wonder why her shortness of breath never stopped. They suspected pulmonary thromboembosis. Her issue with  the bone marrow prevented the docs to do radical treatment (surgery) for this for fear of bleeding.  She passed away 12 April 2011 at 6:30PM.  She was conscious and still had an active mind to the end. Thank's God, my mom never experienced pain. What she has was only a sort of asthma She was a proud and smart cancer fighter. We will miss yu mom.  I hope her courage will become an inspiration to other cancer fighters...it has been our 8 happiest years together...don't go mellow through the night, fight on!
