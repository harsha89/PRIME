He said if its malignant, it's small and early. (of course to me, mms are small, cms are kinda big). They put a clip in after the bx so they would know where it was. Of course it is right at the area where the \"dimples\" are. I should have results by Fri and am doing my best to remain optimistic, but am glad that I chose to proceed and not wait. I am only 44 :) w/o BC history in family and am not a fan at all of being a patient (also a Nurse). If there is something malignant there, knowing myself, I'd have a much harder time forgiving myself for passively not perusing and advocating for my own health!!",
