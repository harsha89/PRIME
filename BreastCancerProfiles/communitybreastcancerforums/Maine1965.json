Anxiety is setting in for me but I'm fine if I keep busy. Got all my blood work done, chest X-rays and now final meetings with BS, PS and primary care doctor. Just waiting for my daughter to get home from her mission trip in Haiti. She is an RN and will take great care of me. Did you say you were taking a shower? I thought you couldn't do that until the drains are out?? That is what I'm dreading.  Hope today is a great day for you :)",
