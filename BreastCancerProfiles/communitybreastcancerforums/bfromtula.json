Luckily, I don't have too many of the risk factors except being a woman and getting older (40), so that was a little comforting. Interesting list, thanks for linking to it. Who would have thought 'being tall' would add a slightly increased risk! Huh.",

      "Content": "bfromtula wrote: Anyone else like a health freak, yet still found lumps? I have been vegetarian for over 30 years, vegan for over 20, and  gluten free for about the last year or so. I eat almost exclusively organic and whole foods. I also exercise almost daily. I also am very aware of environmental pollutants-whole house filtration system for water, no fake wood furniture, no VOC paints, etc.  Yet, I find this giant lump! Still waiting for mammogram. I am discouraged because I feel like if I do have cancer it's not like I can live much cleaner. And of course, how disappointing would it be that you tried to live the cleanest, only to get cancer. I know I am getting ahead of myself because I have not been diagnosed. I guess I am in the waiting, freaking out period. Only to have another waiting, freaking out period after the mammogram! It is just that I feel like this lump is pretty darn big, kind of oddly shaped, and hard. So if I had to guess, it seems like cancer from what I read. I know, I should just wait and not assume.  Plus the doctor seemed pretty happy that I came in almost immediately...which isn't reassuring. Ok, guess I just needed to vent and ramble! Thanks for listening!   edited: spelling  Log in to post a reply",
