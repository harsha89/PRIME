Did your doctor explain the BI-RADS categories to you or give you any indication of what he/she suspected based on the pathology reports?Â  I was in the same position as you in early July and boy can I relate. I obsessed over that BI-RADS5 score! I searched the discussion boards here and couldn't find what I wanted, which I suspect is exactly what you're looking for. I resorted to looking at countless websites and analyzing the wording in the BI-RADS descriptions over an over.Â  Because I had 3 biopsies and an MRI over a period of 3 weeks, it was over a month before I was finally given the results. The waiting was a challenge andÂ I finally took the \"expect the worst, but hope for the best\" approach.Â  Rita, I'm hoping for the best for you!!Â  Christine",

I had an MRI on Tuesday and I am mildly claustrophobic. I was somewhat nervous about not getting a prescription for a sedative prior to the appointment as offered by my doctor. I was relatively calm until the technician put the ear plugs in my ears, which triggered my anxiety. I thought I wasn't going to be able to go through with it, however; the tech was supportive and calm and told me to take a moment and a few deep breaths. So instead of having both ear plugs and headphones I wore just the headphones and the music helped to calm me down. That being said, the noises the MRI makes are very loud and the music was inaudible while the machine was functioning, but there are breaks in the noise while the techs set up each sequence of imaging. My entire session was 25 minutes.Â  Regarding the time frame for results, when I was back at the same hospital on Friday (3 days after MRI) for a stereotactic biopsy, the tech advised me that I would be having another ultrasound prior to the biopsy because of the 'enhancements' that were seen on the MRI. I don't know how long it takes for those results to be made available to my doctors.Â  Best of luck to you on Monday. You're sure to be much more relaxed if you take the sedatives prior to your appointment! Also, it doesn't hurt to give yourself a pep talk prior to and loads of reassurance during the procedure!Â ",

I've often wondered why I was a candidate for neoadjuvant chemo/rads, considering I would require a mastectomy regardless. I was told that because my tumour is large (4.5cm), is grade 3, and has three large satellite lesions (largest is 1.5 x 1.3cm), that this was the reason for wanting to shrink the tumour first. They want to gauge the tumour's response in pathology, I get that, but what about the tumours that don't recede much throughout treatment? I'm scared that leaving my tumour in place for the last year has been a further risk. Through my chemo and radiation, my tumour has not felt like it's shrunk much. It moves around a little more freely than before and the skin is less taut over the tumour now, but it's still large, palpable, and tethered to the skin. I guess we'll see after surgery, but I know the uncertainty you're feeling. This whole ordeal seems like an exercise in how to live with uncertainty. Or how to make decisions when you don't feel like you have all the answers. Essentially, how we're feeling is a normal response to the situation we're in, right",

As a matter of fact I just read an article about worriers that you may find interesting. http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/worriers-are-more-per... So I'm crossing my fingers for you that you've just developed a couple cysts in your breasts. I've had cysts for 15 years and the first time I felt one I panicked ~ it seemed like it just developed overnight. Here is my cautionary advice if your lumps are in fact cysts. I mistakenly thought that my tumour was a cyst for months and months. Cysts can be painful and they can grow and recede with your monthly cycle. The lump I had seemed to have these characteristics. Sometimes I thought it was going to burst, the pressure and pain was intense. But because I'd gone to my doctor on a couple occasions previously for what I thought were suspicious lumps and was told \"it's nothing\", I just assumed the latest lump was nothing. And I heard over and over that cancerdoesn't hurt. Well, it turned out that I had a multi-focal tumour that was 4.7cm and right below it was a large cyst of 4.9cm. I wish I hadn't dismissed it for so long, but i didn't want to be an alarmist. So, don't be afraid to be an alarmist and always get any new lump or change in breast checked out. Wishing the best for you! Let me know how it goes. ðŸ’› ",

If you haven't already read some info about types of biopsies, here is a link http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types... From my own experience having 3 different biopsies: core needle, fine needle aspiration, and stereotactic guided, I can assure you that they were relatively pain-free. The doctors and nurses that I had were very gentle and considerate and they explained the procedure(s) before they started, and as they were performing the biopsies. They gave a local anaesthetic, so I didn't feel any discomfort, except in the case of the stereotactic guided biopsy. In that case the discomfort was just from being in an awkward position, lying on my side and having the breast compressed in the mammogram contraption. I found that waiting for the appointments and for the results was the hardest part. My biopsies and MRI were spread out over three weeks and I didn't get the results until one month from the first biopsy. That seemed like unnecessary torture. Some people get their results very quickly, so let's hope that is the case for you and that the results are benign. Best of luck to you.",

Part of your mom's surgery may have included a sentinel node biopsy. http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/lymph_node_removal/sentinel_dissection As far as travelling during chemo and/or radiation, her oncologist will be able to advise her. For chemo, It will depend on what her regimen will be and the frequency of her treatments (cycles). http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy/process/when Then it will depend on how your mom handles the side effects of her treatments. Everyone is so different and it's impossible to gauge ahead of time. Just a caveat ~ sometimes during chemo, one can feel fine, but can have dangerously low neutrophil counts, which makes you susceptible to infection...avoiding places with lots of people in confined spaces is a good idea. Another thing to consider is whether she would require any vaccinations to travel~they could interact with chemo meds. For radiation, it's usually daily (weekday) treatment for a set period of time (in my case 5 1/2 weeks or 28 treatments), so travel during radiation treatment is pretty much restricted to going and back and forth to the treatment facility. Anyway, lots to think about, but your mom's oncologist will certainly enlighten her/you more. Hope this helps and I hope you get the answers you're looking for, inform farhan. Best of luck to your mom during her treatment. Give her lots of your love and support.",
