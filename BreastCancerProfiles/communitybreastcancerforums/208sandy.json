However, gabapentin doesn't work for me and I've tried it twice now - I've added a magnesium supplement to my regime but you have to be careful with it as it can cause horrendous diarrhea if too high a dose - the low dose has stopped my leg cramping so I can sleep at night but now that I am on Faslodex I am having really bad foot drop in both feet and burning pain on the bottoms that is making me crazy - walking long distances has become almost impossible but I soldier on because I have a dog and she has to be walked three times a day - it was Taxotere that caused this I am told.",

Now for your father, my father had Alzeimers and before he was diagnosed there were several years of strange behaviour - paranoia, not eating properly, HUGE hypochondria, he used to take his pulse and call our poor family doctor AT HOME at 3 a.m. - yikes.  Anway, I think there you need to get in touch with a social worker, try the place you're getting cancer treatment - you need help and you need it now - I cannot believe all you are doing, working fulltime, travelling for chemo and trying to put up with your father's behaviour (which really isn't his fault but at this point he has to be dealt with) - I know it's easy for us to say \"move\" but I know it costs a lot of money to do that - your siblings need to help you out at least with your dad.

Wish I could think of what might relieve your constipation - I went through a bad patch a few years ago and after trying all the drugs one of my nurses said her mother swore by warm prune juice - I drank a full cup of it - waited an hour or two and had relief - I've used it a couple of times since - all I have to do is look at the word codeine and I am blocked for days.  I used Oxy a few years back for pain and it worked like a charm so I say \"go for it\".

Also PCP made me get the pneumonia shot twice - once before I contracted pneumonia then after - turns out there are many pneumonias and the shots don't cover every one of them. I spent 63 years with no flu shot and rarely got the flu but PCP nabbed me a few years back and I've had the shot every year and touch wood no flu for six years! Would definitely get the pertussis vac if around small grandchildren - whooping cough will break your heart if you ever see a small child in the throes of it!",

Oh yes, use a base coat. I don't go to a professional for mani pedi any longer as I am afraid of infection just don't want to risk it (I am stage iv).

Did you talk to your PCP and see if anti-anxiety drugs, or anti-depressants or both might be of help? I would think that estrogen replacement is the last thing you should do - it could throw you into Stage IV and that's, to my thinking, not a place you want to be (I am Stage IV) - you don't say if you're on an AI - they can mess with your sleep, emotions and everything else - there are three very effective ones so you could switch to another one - hope this helps.

I also keep my nails really short now it's much safer.  Good luck.",

CK -   I am stage 111 and almost (in one month) three years out from treatment - I had clean scans two weeks ago and now I am on screening every six months - my onc in the US (where I started my journey) told me to go out and \"live my life\" and I have followed his advice - I do know that this time of year can be depressing it may have to do with the low light or the stress from Christmas and holiday preparations - that said, try not to worry about survival stats and live the best life you can - there are no guarantees for ANYONE......
