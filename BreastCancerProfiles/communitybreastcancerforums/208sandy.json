However, gabapentin doesn't work for me and I've tried it twice now - I've added a magnesium supplement to my regime but you have to be careful with it as it can cause horrendous diarrhea if too high a dose - the low dose has stopped my leg cramping so I can sleep at night but now that I am on Faslodex I am having really bad foot drop in both feet and burning pain on the bottoms that is making me crazy - walking long distances has become almost impossible but I soldier on because I have a dog and she has to be walked three times a day - it was Taxotere that caused this I am told.",

Wish I could think of what might relieve your constipation - I went through a bad patch a few years ago and after trying all the drugs one of my nurses said her mother swore by warm prune juice - I drank a full cup of it - waited an hour or two and had relief - I've used it a couple of times since - all I have to do is look at the word codeine and I am blocked for days.Â  I used Oxy a few years back for pain and it worked like a charm so I say \"go for it\".

Also PCP made me get the pneumonia shot twice - once before I contracted pneumonia then after - turns out there are many pneumonias and the shots don't cover every one of them. I spent 63 years with no flu shot and rarely got the flu but PCP nabbed me a few years back and I've had the shot every year and touch wood no flu for six years! Would definitely get the pertussis vac if around small grandchildren - whooping cough will break your heart if you ever see a small child in the throes of it!",

Oh yes, use a base coat. I don't go to a professional for mani pedi any longer as I am afraid of infection just don't want to risk it (I am stage iv).

Sorry about your horrendous summer but perhaps things are starting to get better - you need to rest girl!!! I know you hate to hear that but the healing will get done when it gets done - I hate resting too so I don't practice what I preach! Sending hugs, S.",

CK - Â  I am stage 111 and almost (in one month) three years out from treatment - I had clean scans two weeks ago and now I am on screening every six months - my onc in the US (where I started my journey) told me to go out and \"live my life\" and I have followed his advice - I do know that this time of year can be depressing it may have to do with the low light or the stress from Christmas and holiday preparations - that said, try not to worry about survival stats and live the best life you can - there are no guarantees for ANYONE...... Hugs, Sandy",
