Lauderdale.   I was diagnosed Nov. 2013 and had bmx January 3, 2014.  My mom had breast cancer and my brother reminded me that our mother had her surgery on January 3, 1967.  I took that as a sign that my momo would be in the operating room with my surgeons on the 45th anniversary of her breast cancer surgery. She was an amazing survivor and passed away in 2006 from an unrelated disease. My faith has helped me through all of this since my mom is now in heaven.  I remember the day before my surgery we were having a family dinner - my husband of 25 years, my 23 year old son, 15 year old daughter, and me.  At the end of dinner my daughter who is a dancer got up and started twirling around.  Out of her hands I see a white dove and I shout, OMG I just saw a white dove fly out of Kaitlin's hands. They all looked at me like I was a bit crazy.  When I looked up on the intranet what they could mean it said it was a symbol that the holy spirit was with me.  I never cried again.. I have passed my one year cancerversary and have gone through 4 surgeries for reconstruction and am very pleased with my results.  Focus on yourself and be kind to yourself.  Believe in your doctors and if you don't then find new ones.  Take everything one day at a time. ",
