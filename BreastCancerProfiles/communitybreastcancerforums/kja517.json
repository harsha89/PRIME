I am so sorry you and so many of your family members have been affected by this ugly disease. Thank you for asking about my daughter. Actually today, was 1 year, when she got the phone call from her OB/GYN telling her she had cancer. She and her husband spent the day doing FUN activities, to erase the memories of last year. She is doing so well and I have to thank you,  for your articles on staying fit, excersising, and eating right. She is in better shape now than she ever was. With being Triple Negative, after chemo, surgery and rads, from everything I have read, taking care of yourself is the key to hopefully not having a recurrance. I look forward to reading more on your website and here on breastcancer.org. Thank you.",
