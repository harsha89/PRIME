I also felt badly before I was diagnosed \u2014 shortness of breath, night sweats, fatigue, no appetite. I had pulmonary embolisms and tumors in my lungs and liver. I started to feel better after my first chemo treatment. It helps me to remember that the treatments are killing all those cancer cells that were making me feel crappy. I hope your symptoms start to improve quickly",

I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best if I consistently take Tylenol the day after chemo until the days I get my worst side effects, then I switch to Percocet.
