      "Content": "May 4, 2010 09:33PM - edited May 4, 2010 09:35PM by Milena1 Liz, I've had 2 breast MRI's, one just for imaging and the other one for a biopsy. I think the worst thing is feeling claustrophobic. If you think you are even slightly claus., I would ask doc for something to calm you down before the MRI. I needed a pill both times, and I think it helped a lot. Also, headphones help greatly with the noise problem. Ask for them. I listened to classical music and it relaxed me. However, the breast MRI BIOPSY was awful for me. I bled profusely and suffered a huge and very painful hematoma that took four months to subside! (I don't know how common this problem is with the biopsies though.) I think they can usually do the biopsy using ultrasound, but my lesion, which turned out benign by the way, couldn't be seen with ultrasound.  By having the MRIs, will you not have to have mammograms? Good luck to you, Liz. I think with a little support you will be 100% fine with the MRI. Hang in there. ",

I am a candidate for it and will have to decide between Contura and whole breast irradiation by Tuesday. Any info would be greatly appreciated. I'm wondering how painful it was, whether one can shower while the balloon is implanted, and what kind of fatague to expect. Any other info would be helpful, too. Many thanks!",

After MRI biopsy of left breast, I was told I had a \"peripheral, solitary papilloma at the 12:00 position.\" Two surgeons told me I do not need the excisional after all because of the \"peripheral, solitary\" characteristics of the papilloma. Apparently this kind is benign and not likely to turn malignant. Hoping your papilloma DX will turn out the same way.  Milena",
