    "Content": "Oct 17, 2018 01:14AM - edited Oct 17, 2018 01:17AM by joleen_lee2003 I found a smooth, pea sized lump near my nipple as well back in 2007. Mammogram stated most likey a clogged duct but was told to monitor it for growth and have it rechecked. However, life got busy and I haven't had another mammogram and it's doubled the size. I've also noticed a lump in the right side of my neck.Definitely going to follow up with my doctor this week.",
