I took some muscle relaxers and was able to sleep a couple hours but am up and in pain again. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to lay where your neck is comfortable? Also my top incision is right under my boney collarbone and when I move my collarbone has been popping and everything feels like its strung too tight. I know it will be better in the end, it took 4 tries to get my IV in and that was the easiest IV placement I have had in months. Usually it is 10+ tries. I also have a DVT in my left arm. I just need to get through the healing period.",

You are on Dilantin. It counteracts the sedation. I am so upset the hospital didn't know this or check on me under the blue tent during the procedure. Was anyone's upper incision right on the collarbone? I'm one week post op and am still having a lot of uncontrolled pain. It hurts to breathe deeply. I go in tomorrow to remove my sutures. Hopefully they will have some answers for me.",

They gave me Versed for sedation and it didn't work a bit. I felt everything. I bawled the entire procedure. The hospital didn't send me home with any pain meds at all! I had a few Vicodin at home and they didn't touch the pain. About 5 hours post surgery I was shaking, couldn't lift my arm or take a deep breath. My boyfriend had a Percocet leftover from a recent gallbladder surgery and that did help a little. I called my hematologist and he couldn't believe I hadn't been released with any meds. He called in Vicodin and scheduled an appt for tomorrow. Hopefully it will get me through the night.",
