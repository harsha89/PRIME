Sincerely, Heatherlynn",

      "Content": "Oct 22, 2010 03:21PM - edited Oct 22, 2010 03:51PM by Heatherlynn Hi Denna, The biopsies are performed here in Ontario by radiologists.  The radiologist that read my first ultrasound found it to be suspicious and recommended a biopsy.  Based on this, I was referred to a surgeon to whom the biopsy report would be sent.  The radiologist that refused to do the biopsy felt that the lesion was only \"blocked ducts\" caused by breastfeeding and that it was a waste of HER time.  She flatly refused to follow the recommendations of the previous radiologist and surgeon.  She did NOT know that I have never even given birth !  So she made an assumption without knowing anything about me.  I am 58 years old and she could have at least asked about my history.  I explained this chain of events to my former surgeon and she NEVER FOLLOWED UP.  What a mess !  That is when my family physician stepped in, repeated the ultrasound, got the results showing significant growth, and now I am waiting to meet with a new surgeon.  The purpose of seeing the new surgeon is to basically start from scratch.  Our healthcare system in Ontario leaves a lot to be be desired so I am hoping that this new surgeon will be on top of his game and that the biopsy will done in a timely fashion.  My situation is complicated by only by lack of follow up by my former surgeon.  So here I sit with a lesion/mass that is growing significantly and now I am starting to get concerned.  It is my understanding that benign growths do not grown rapidly.  There was no mention of bi-rad rating said to me so I'm the dark as far as that is concerned.  I hope this explains the situation further.  Oh, I forgot to mention that the first surgeon I was sent to also felt that a biopsy was necessary.  The delay between November and March was caused by the former surgeon constantly cancelling my appointments and re-scheduling.  I guess I should informed my family physician sooner.",
