Went to a surgeon to try and have pin removed so many infections tokk antibiotics . surgeon said be to difficult to remove it. Now staph in breast I fear has set off cancer u have cancer genes and I am hyperallergetic. My body was trying to reject pin marker for 2 years breast trying to reject it .was like a sliver in there . now I am afraid of what staph in there has set off. Cancer follows infections. Concerned . I have been sent to a surgeon because xray shows a ma's now around pin marker.",
