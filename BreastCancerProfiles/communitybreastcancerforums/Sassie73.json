I am so hoping that they will know if it's cancer or not by the time I walk out of there. I am trying to tell myself not to worry. It will just make my blood pressure go up and cause other problems. I look at my 5 year old and start stressing out. I want to be here for him and my husband for a very long time! Guess I am just looking for some encouragement! Thanks for reading!
