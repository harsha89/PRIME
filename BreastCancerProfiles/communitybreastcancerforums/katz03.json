We are drinking to celebrate that Sarah has now passed the 18 months the oncologist gave her to survive and is kicking it!!! I also want to thanks you all for all your good thoughts, prayers, pictures, words of encouragement and advice and if Sarah could speak she would join me in thanking you all. Although it is sad that Sarah doesn`t understand what we are celebrating it has a plus side cos thankfully she doesn`t understand that she has breast cancer either!! Only Tamoxifen, no chemo, no rads, large tumour highly aggressive cells, masectomy, over 20 positive lymph nodes, mrsa, shingles ........... that has been Sarah`s life over the last eighteen months. Sarah has smiled and laughed as normal since the day of the operation (more or less whilst getting through some of the above). That doesn`t mean there haven`t been tears sometimes with some pain but she has been really brave. I am going to have a second glass now! Sarah will have diet coke as usual! Hope you enjoyed the cyber celebration party I have really enjoyed inviting you. God bless you all.
