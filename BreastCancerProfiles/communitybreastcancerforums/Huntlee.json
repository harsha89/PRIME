I have chemo this week and consult with the ps next week. I'm going to ask him about it again, I think I'll make a consult appt w/ the doc that does do the one step. Even though its further away, it might be worth it. If I'm not a candidate for a valid reason, at least I tried. I am currently a C, and personally, I don't care what size I end up as long as its close to being symmetrical. I should be able to have the ns, skin sparing mastectomy according to the gs. Ginger, you may be onto something w/ the present scars and not enough skin. It seems like I do, but I'm not the surgeon! Thank you again for your responses and good luck to everyone! Jen",

I met w/ the general surgeon yesterday to discuss having a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I had a lumpectomy 10/12 and am almost to the end of my last chemo!! Yea! My lumpectomy didn't heal correctly. I have a 'puckered' scar where the incision was made and a secondary scar caused from the cauterization tool. I'm in good overall health, skin is not thin, my weight is great and consistent and my tumor was small < 1cm. When I asked about the one step, he said I wasn't a candidate. His plan is to do the dble mx, then have the ps do implants with TE's. I want it over with and it seems like TE takes a long time, 4-6 months? The only ps that I have found near me that does the one step Is at the UW in Seattle, about 1 1/2 hours from me. Is it worth pursuing? t seems like maybe there are not too many ps that are trained in this? What was recovery time like? Thanks for your replies!",
