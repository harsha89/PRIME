Years ago right after my first dx, I had tried out for roller derby. I severely tore my hamstring which left bad bruises down my leg. Because of the weak hamstring, I slipped and broke my knee cap on the other leg, requiring a full length cast. This was only a month or so after the groin graft for my nipples..... So here I had a cast, huge bruises down the back of the other leg and long scars in my groin. I joked to my female gyn...\"isn't this the ugliest pu$$y you've ever seen?\" She didnt miss a beat, \"I've seen better!!!\"",
