I realized today that I almost had 2 weeks of no treatments, dr appts, lab tets, etc while I waited to start rads. I decided to embrace it and try and remember that this will not define the rest of my life. At some point my life will go back to normal - maybe a slightly altered normal, but still a more normal. I also try very hard to live in the moment - enjoy each day I feel good and just remind myself that \"today\" is a \"gift\" and that is why it is called the \"present\". When my thoughts wander to the future or a dark place I literally say \"STOP\" which helps me focus again on the right now. I know it may sound simple and it isn't easy but I have been practicing this for several years now - it was my way to cope with some losses in my life and it has now become a way of life for me. That doesn't mean I still don't get sad or afraid or have a pity party - but I truly limit the amount of time I dwell in that place. imalso have found a lot of support and encouragement from some amazing women on this site and I hope you do too. Sending you positive thoughts and hugs...",

I know it may sound weird but I was actually sad (and scared) to have my chemo come to an end - as tough as it was - I at least felt protected in some way while getting chemo. My nurses said that many women felt that way. I have always been a person who liked to be in control - a planner - and Cancer has truly made me realze how little control one has. But I CAN control the way I think and feel so I try and stay as positive as I can each and every day. Being negative or sad or angry won't change anything - just make me feel worse!

I literally cleaned my closet that first weekend which gave me a false sense of how I would fair. The 2nd treatment was not as easy - especially after the Nuelasta shot. I usually had bad bone aches over the weekend but then felt good enough to go to work on Monday. Constipation was a challenge for me as was a few other minor annoying SEs, but was able to take things to help with most everything. Be careful to really keep an eye on your temperature etc and if you start to feel bad (excessive fatigue, malaise, etc) do not put off going to the hospital. After my third treatment I felt really bad but I thought I would get better the next day - thought it was temporary. But I landed in hospital. Turned out to just be a cold but was there for 2 1/2 days in December. Even a minor cold is dangerous. I thought I was tougher than chemo, but I learned I was not. Despite that set back I was able to still take a 5 day trip to Vegas over New Years. Spent most of my time in the hotel room in bed resting, but after a few days I got more energy and had a nice time. It was importent that my hubby get a break from BC and I see seomething other than a hospital or my office. We timed the trip to end fairly close to my next treatment when I was likely to feel my best. Taxol doesn't affect you like AC but it brings its own set of SE. I got more mouth sores but found rinsing with salt water helped a lot. And had a lot of bone aches for a few days. I took the Claritin everyday during treatment (as recommended by some) Not sure if it helped but I tried everything recommended. I figured it couldn't hurt. All in all, I truly found I had more good days than bad days. Everyone at the treatment center was so nice and supportive and I usually had the same nurse each time. I know it is scary and will be hard some days but I promise you will get through it. I will be thinking of you each and every day. Hugs, Candy",

You have to decide which one will be easier to live with moving forward. If they don't get clean margins with LX will you you be prepared to have 2nd LX? If you choose LX will you have a lot of anxiety every time you go for your mammo and wait for results? Will MX give you greater peace of mind or will losing a full (or both breasts) be worse than the anxiety of yearly mammos? Only you can decide - no one else - At the suggestion of my first surgeon I opted for KX even though in the back if my mind I knew it wouldn't work and of course we didn't get clean margins. She couldn't do the BMX for 4 weeks do I went with her colleague (who I lived) and had BMX 2 weeks later. Glad I did cause there were multifocal tumors and my other breast had something ( can't remember name) that increased my risk for developing cancer in the future (nope-cancerous just increased risk). I also knew I would dread yearly mammos on my one breast and would always worry they were not finding something - just like they missed my ILC in my left breast. Again - it is such a hard decision. I wish u strength and peace as u move forward and whatever decision u make will be the right one for you. No looking back - just look forward! Hugs, candy",

I did neoadjuvant chemo. I liked the idea that we would be able to monitor / measure how well my tumor responded. My MO said that up to 60% of women have a total response and that most will at least have a partial response. My response was not total but it did reduce the size of my tumors by about 50%. Because my cancer was ILC and tumors were large I knew I would still choose MX - but still glad I chose neoadjuvant as I at least know the chemo was at least effective in killing some of the cancer cells. I too had positive nodes before chemo and 3of 4 of my sentinel nodes were still positive after chemo but no evidence of cancer higher up in my lymph system. Chemo was followed by surgery and now I am doing radiation which will hopefully kill off any possible microscopic cells in my lymph system. It probably feels very overwhelming at the moment - but use this site to ask questions, get tips and to find support as you move forward. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Hugs",

We started with an X-ray which showed \"fractured rib or \"possible Lesion\". Of course the word \"lesion\" was worrisome so she recommended a bone scan or PET. I asked for head to toe PET & it found no evidence of cancer (except my Thyroid Lit up - which after a biopsy showed no evidence of cancer-thank goodness). That was last year in oct. I still have left (and right sided) rib pain and some back & hip pain so i will continue to ask for some type of testing every year. My bone density test showed arthritis of spine & hips & some osteopenia. I take Aromisin - so I attribute \"SOME\" of my aches & pains to the arthritis etc - but wouldn't not recommend attributing long term rib pain to a condition that hasn't been fully tested /diagnosed through testing- at least a basic X-ray. I agree with Deb823. Not sure a 2nd opinion is warranted if you like your treatment team but definitely I would ask / demand a more definitive test such as a X-ray, bone scan or PET. I opted for PET/CT since it would be the most conclusive. I asked my onc if the bone scan showed \"something\" would she then order the PET - & she said yes - so I said then why not just do the PET/CT scan & be on done with it. She agreed. I hope & prayer it is nothing - and I too try not to think about recurrence - but you should have peace of mind. Sending good thoughts & hugs - Candy",

X-ray showed left rib fracture or \"possible lesion. The pain persisted and since I had not done anything to break a rib and my cancer was on left side I asked for PET scan (Nov 16). Scan showed no sign of cancer (except my thyroid lit up - which also turned out to be benign based on biopsies). I still have the pains now on both sides and was also having pains in my left armpit and collarbone areA. Last week was another 6 month follow up so my onco agreed to an MRI and it showed nothing suspicious. She feels it may be scar tissue build up Under my arm as I no longer have been doing stretching exercises. The other pains may just be side effects of AI and arthritis. The rib fracture was not even mentioned on my PET scan - oddly. Because I also had radiation to my left side - that in combination with the AI pill may have weakened the ribs which is why the fracture appeared last year. I guess I'm saying - don't go to \"the dark place\" and assume the worst - it may be nothing major. But DO follow up and go with your gut and what your body is telling you. If PET scan will put your mind at ease - demand it. Sending pisitive thought & prayers your way. Candy",

Not sure that will work for me cause my friends are not at all close to one another as I have moved around a lot in my life - but am blessed with knowing I have a lot of women friends in my life who will say prayers and who will lend an ear. But as I have said already - it seems that only women who heard the words \"you have BC\" will truly understand the variety of emotions and fears one is feeling. Right now this site is my comfort zone and I am so VERY thankful I have somewhere I can pour my feelings out and not be judged or told a simple platitude. This is an amazing group of women who I believe share so much more then our fight against this terrible disease. Hugs to you! ",

Had my yearly Mammo last week Friday and when they called to schedule a follow up Mammo and ultrasound I had a bad feeling. Had my biopsy Wednesday and got path results this afternoon at work. Feeling so overwhelmed and scared - mainly because I know so little at this stage. Have to wait about a week to get a breast MRI and to see a breast surgeon. Would love to know what I should be asking and what to expect with this type of cancer. I am not yet 59 - and this diagnosis has turned my world upside down. I am a control freak and a planner so my natural reaction was to learn all I could. So glad to have found this site. I think I will need it in the coming weeks and months. Right now all I want to do is cry and hide but know that neither will help or change what is. My mom passed away from breast cancer complicated with colon cancer - so you can imagine where my thoughts are going. Sorry to be such a Debbie downer - not my usual style.

I have a great hubby but I am usually the one who takes charge at dr. Apps and asks all the questions. But he will definitely be there if nothing else to lend a shoulder to cry on.  And yes - I will definitely ask for copies of reports - great suggestion. I already printed out the path guide on this website which was very helpful and informative. I know she I walked the journey with my Mom with her colon cancer and re-occurring breast cancer I sometimes felt as though I earned a nursing or medical degree - it is all so daunting. Thank you again and continued good health is my wish and lrayer for you! ",

I have ways made this the one \"cause\" that I have supported with volunteer work with American Cancer Society as well as donations,WTD. Just was hoping that I would not be 1 of the over 200,000 diagnosed this year. Silly I know to think I should be exempt. Wishing you many more years of great check ups! And again - thank you for the post. ",

I am trying hard to stay positive but am full of a lot of pent up emotions and fears. I keep coming to various discussion boards to try and find some strength - as I know so many women unfortunately have been where I am now and have gotten through it. Guess I am just having a small pity party......just typing out these feeling and having a place to put my thoughts and feelings is helpful. I have been mentally preparing for this day and thought I was string and ready but guess I was just fooling myself - -- any tips to get through this stage are welcomed! ",
