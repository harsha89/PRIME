After hours, the room was open to use and you could still get coffee. Maybe some of the hotels have that. But I would bet if someone calls the manager, the manager would be able to figure out something for everyone. Maybe several adjoining rooms and a suite??",

We couldn't get him to leave our side when we came back in. He is either getting super protective or something?? He has been my shadow since I got home this evening.

We went to Catalina Island with another mom and her daughter. Our girls had a blast and we went on the submarine to see the fish. I know someone from the Island and we borrowed a golf cart which meant that (it was free for one) we could go further than with a rented one. There are no rental cars! To get a vehicle, it's a 22 year wait and each family is only entitled to one golf cart. The whole town is only one square mile so most people ride a bike or walk. Everything really is within walking distance. Here's the view from the room:   Here is drink that is NOT just for one person: Jazz hands Dinner with dear daughter View from atop the hill",

I got the house ready for Halloween ... had my extension ladder out and we are one spooky house with cobwebs hanging and spiders on the webs. We have Frankenstein and Dracula, a skeleton, a scarecrow and a huge spider in one of the webs hanging down!  I put Halloween garland around the door and little signs in the lawn. I was so happy to surprise Miss T when she got home from school and she was filled with her little girl glee.  But you know girls, she wanted to shop for more!!! So we got a tombstone for the lawn and paper lantern hanging from the tree, we got a skeleton face for the door that talks when someone comes up to it. OH WHAT FUN KIDS ARE!!!! ",

      "Content": "Jan 27, 2008 07:00PM - edited Jan 27, 2008 07:01PM by Rocktobermom went to church today and saw a lady with our very expensive haircut that we had last year. You know, the one where you have about an inch of hair all over?!  Not our former bald look. I saw her and watched to see that she came back from communion.  As I walked back to my seat, I looked her right in the eyes instead of looking away.  After Mass was over, I made a b-line to her and said, \"I noticed your haircut.\" And she said she had chemo and lost her hair.  I explained I had the same look about year ago.  Funny, it was, she said she was looking at me, noticed my HAIR and said she couldn't wait for hers to be like that, it was the way she wore her hair normally.  My hair is all almost the same length now, about to hit the shoulders, trying to grow out the bangs ... they are too long for bangs and I wear them to the side.  Now, right now, I just noticed we didn't exchange names. She is done with treatment, though. I will look for her again.  I told her I was proud of her wearing her hair.  It was pure white.  I told her mine had been white too but the color came back.  She was excited about that. I also got an email today from my step sister.  Her friend (so has to be in her late 30's) has been dx'd with bc.  She gave her my email.  Not sure how I feel about that .... I referred her to bc.org.  I'm not sure I could \"mentor\" anyone thru this ....",

When the boards got difficult for some to navigate it really became the catalyst for what we had been discussing already.  Some wanted to move on so we could talk privately, we also wanted to move \"away\" from cancer on a daily basis.  Some of us look around here and post in other forums.  With the news of Kelly's death (Sedgymum), it's hard to be here everyday. We still think of cancer everyday but I really really need to try to move on and stop sending a cancer message into the universe.  My fear shouts too loud. When you have a thread as active as ours, sometimes posts would get lost and some of us would not have time to catch up and would miss something, so now we do emails.  And that keeps us organized. We love bco for what it gave us but it really is time to stop visiting here in the Chemo forum on a daily basis. I visit humor and also moving on .... see you all there.",

It is more common in women 60 and older. You are also more likely to get it if you have a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or if your mother took diethylstilbestrol (DES) when she was pregnant. Doctors prescribed DES in the 1950's to prevent miscarriages. It often doesn't have early symptoms. However, see your doctor if you notice A Pap test can find abnormal cells that may be cancer.

I called SCE, SoCal Edison and they too, have a form that they send out, you fill it out and have your dr sign it. They will raise your baseline allowance.  But you have to call in. The ACS ... that's the American Cancer Society.  BethNY mentioned that they have vouchers for housekeeping services while you are in treatment, maybe they do it more often if you are stage 4.  I know when I called the ACS, they sent me some forms to keep track of my mileage and will give you up to $400 per year for transportation to and from dr's visits and chemo treatments. I did have to make the phone call to the ACS and to my electric company.  I think each person will have to just use their bill to get the phone number and the ACS phone number is 1·800·ACS·2345",

Make up a chemo bag ... like a diaper bag ... you keep it ready for onc visits and chemo ... it's good to have an extra pair of socks, a book, glasses, an iPod, ear buds or a headset to plug into the tv, and a soft blanket (the chemo room ones were itchy) oh and CHOCOLATE and hard candy ... I loved eating chocolate or sucking on mints in my chemo chair....

They call it a cocktail and your routine will be the same every week.  You won't react the same every week.  Your doc probably gave you an rx for Ativan, take it tonight and don't forget your anti nausea meds, you will get them today, THEY WORK. Ativan is to calm you down and help you sleep.  The steroids they give you on chemo day can sometimes make you agitated and stay awake. Good luck. ",

Friends always tell you that you will be fine and how curable b.c. is... they have no clue how many different kinds of bc there are or what the stages and grades even mean.  You will gain a lot of comfort and strength here and learn how to deal with the bc beast gracefully.  And I still cry at the dr's office.... it's the only place I can have someone focus on me, worry about me with me.",

      "Content": "Apr 13, 2008 10:32PM Rocktobermom wrote: He has leukemia ........  John Kanzius is his name.  He was never a scientist or doctor and this machine all came about because he used to make radios. If you put metal in the tumor and then you go in the machine, the metal heats up, destroys the cancer (tumor) but radio waves are harmless to flesh and blood.  Thats good for the initial tumor but if you have mets you have to search out individual cancer cells which is why the nanoparticles need to be released into the blood stream. The nanoparticles are made of calcium.  Here is part of the show to explain:    ------ Kanzius placed the hot dog in his radio wave machine, and Stahl watched to see if the temperature would rise in that one area where the metal solution was and nowhere else. \"And when I saw it start to go up I said, 'Eureka, I've done it,'\" Kanzius remembered. \"And I said, 'God, I gotta shut this off and see whether it's still cold down below.' So I shut it off, took my probe, went down here where it wasn\u2019t injected. And the temperature dropped back down. And I said, 'God, maybe I got something here.'\" Kanzius thought he had found a way attack cancer cells without the collateral damage caused by chemotherapy and radiation. Today, his invention is in the laboratories of two major research centers - the University of Pittsburgh and M.D. Anderson, where Dr. Steven Curley, a liver cancer surgeon, is testing it. \"This technology may allow us to treat just about any kind of cancer you can imagine,\" Dr. Curley told Stahl. \"I've gotta tell you, in 20 years of research this is the most exciting thing that I\u2019ve encountered.\" That's because Kanzius impressed Curley with another remarkable idea: to combine the radio waves from his device with something cutting edge - space age nanoparticles made of metal or carbon. They are so small that thousands of them can fit in a single cancer cell. Because they\u2019re metallic, Kanzius was hoping his radio waves would them heat up and kill the cancer. \"If these nanoparticles work then we truly have something huge here,\" Kanzius told Stahl. Enter Rick Smalley, another cancer patient at M.D. Anderson and the man who won the Nobel Prize for discovering nanoparticles made from carbon. As luck would have it, Dr. Curley was called in one day to examine Smalley. Before leaving, he asked him for some of his nanoparticles. \"I proceeded to tell him what I wanted to do and that I thought they would heat. He looked at me with sort of a studied long look and didn\u2019t say anything. And then he looked at me and said, 'It won\u2019t work,'\" Curley remembered. \"And just laughed and said, 'Well, look, I'll give you some. But don't be too disappointed.'\" So Dr. Curley brought a vial of those precious nanoparticles to John Kanziu.",
