    "Content": "tina6 wrote: I found an oval shaped lump under right nipple July 22. About the size of elongated marble. Dr. said good news that it was smooth and moveable. I Had mammogram and ultrasound, told it is likely benign fibro adenoma, was recommended and scheduled biopsy just to be sure. But when I spoke with my temporary Dr. (am out of town caring for aging parents) they informed me it was category 4 risk and I'm scheduled to meet with surgeon. I'm 47, alone with 2 kids away from home. I don't want to tell my parents, they have enough of their own medical issues to contend with. I've been scanning the internet but would sure appreciate anecdotal info. How common is the category 4 label used? Any other women out there over 45 had this? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
