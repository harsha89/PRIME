My doctors seem to be being very upfront with me but it's interesting how one test will give a tumor size and another test will state a different tumor size OR it will say the tumor size is undetermined.  I wonder if it really matters?!  I would just like to have an accurate Stage - my oncologist says that my tumor is so close to the skin that they are treating it as a tumor AND inflammatory b.c. because I have the super treat of nipple retraction. At this point, I'm not too worried about the chemo itself.  My dr. says that they use the spray to make the area super cold and numbing so there won't be much pain when my port is accessed.  I'm sure that might change once I've actually had the round.  Since chemo is on Thursday, what day should I expect to feel the worst?  I'd love to be one of those \"no symptom\" people!",

As predicted, my newly grown hair (about 1\" long since the chemo break for surgery) has started dropping off like crazy!!! I can't keep myself from tugging and rubbing it. I can hardly believe anything is left at this point. I expect to be without it again sometime next week, just in time for my next treatment. I'm not planning on wearing a wig this time around...too itchy. Plus, I have several really nice head scarves and caps. I have had a SUPER week! I've been working every day - trying to get everything I can done before I get sick again. I'm off this weekend so I hope you all have a great couple of days. I'll check back in soon!",

After telling him the initial diagnosis, obviously a lot of guess work since I hadn't had surgery yet, he told me \"at least it isn't horrible\"!  I told him that being sick, losing my hair and potentially my breast, and having to worry about recurrence for the rest of my life sounded pretty bad to me.  He then said \"horrible is relative\". How do you respond to THAT???",
