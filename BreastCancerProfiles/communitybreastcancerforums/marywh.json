You have every reason to believe you'll be ok. I know this is such a scary time for you. Please dont jump the gun and start thinking ahead about the what ifs.

I also found some great foot balm, called Restoration Foot Balm by the Naked Bee out of Johnson City Tenn. Believe it or not I found it at the hardware store. Great for cracking and chapped skin.

They said my leg could break at any time so I have to use a walker. They wanted me to use crutches, but I cant because of the lymphedema. Don't know where they'll go from here. They could put a rod in my leg, but that would mean down time from chemo, and I cant do that cause the mets to my liver has grown a lot.

I dont have them, close, as I have alot of mets to the chest wall, but they dont consider them bone mets. Have plenty of others to make up for them though. Liver, another primary in my right breast,with lymph involvement, and a small place on my lung that was there then gone and now back again. Im on Gemzar for 6 wks straight, hopefully that will knock it back down to stable anyway. Did have a frightening case of roid rage yesterday, driving home from chemo I was so mad, and it was all directed at my sweet men who havnt done anything but put up with this shit for 6 years. Came home and took a lorazipam and was a little better after that, but it was scary. Carolben, hope you are on the mend finally, Im glad you're with your son,even in these circumstances.",
