I worry constantly about my heart/lung involvement in rads as my cancer was on the left.  I have seen my mapping photos, but I am worried because they could not effectively remove my heart from the rads field.  The info on thyroid was very enlightening as well and I intend to ask my RO about it on Tuesday. Thanks for sharing everyone! SAN",

This freaked me out because my 19 year old daughter had a brain tumor at 7 yrs old that resulted in a scary brain surgery that almost took her life, but she fought hard.  (She's grown up and perfectly healthy now ~ thank God :)  I avoided the MRI due to cost and plain old avoidance, on my part.  I finally found a chiropractor that brought me some relief and we determined it was probably a pinched nerve in my neck. Fast-forward 4 months and I stood in a Radiologist's office looking at my mammogram and ultrasound results.  He said he would compare my previous films, but that he thought it was nothing.  I actually got a letter from them saying they believed my tumor to be benign and to come back in 6 months.  If not for feeling so bad physically from the vertigo...I might have ignored the tumor longer.  When I finally got my breast cancer diagnosis, my mind went immediately to the worst possible scenario.  I share this with you because I want you to be encouraged that symptoms are not always what they seem, but persistent symptoms should always be checked out. When I finally shared my vertigo issues with my medical team, I was in a brain MRI the next day.  As I mentioned in my previous post...it was totally normal.  When my BC tumor was removed, I woke up perfectly clear headed and have never suffered with it since.  I recently shared that with the general surgeon who did my MX and she called it a miracle.  Whatever it might have been.  I choose to give God the thanks.  That vertigo might have actually saved my life.

I've learned (mostly from you Stage IV ladies) how bone and lung mets often present, but I haven't heard anything about which symptoms are evident for liver mets. SAN",

Kicks ~ I am also allergic to Sulfa drugs.  I didn't realize that might be something to discuss with my RO when I go in on 3/12.  Thanks for the heads up! Kelley ~ I am so surprised at all of you who are being told to swap out your TE's for implants prior to rads.  I thought implants didn't do well with rads, but now I'm starting to think that it might depend on how large of an area will be radiated.  Keep us posted on what your RO says when you meet with him, would you? Thanks everyone, SAN",
