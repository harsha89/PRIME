The x-ray tech showed me my pictures and said that what is on the right breast should be on the left. So I have a big white spot on my left breast and not on the right. There were some other white areas that were on both breast. She said the area on the left hasn't calcified yet and the doctor suggests that I come back in 6 months to see if anything changes. I have read a few things on mammograms and the different findings, but I haven't read anything about how both breast should be exactly that same. When she showed me the x-ray I kind of freaked out because there is this huge white spot that takes up a lot of my left breast. I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor. Thanks!
