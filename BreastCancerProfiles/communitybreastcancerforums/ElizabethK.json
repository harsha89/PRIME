You've done a great thing by reaching out. I had a lump that felt like it was part of my rib as well. It was located unusually high in my chest. Dr.s were not concerned..so..I blew it off for 4 years. It started out hard and changed over time in that it grew in size, attached to the skin, and chest wall. It turned out it was cancer. I'm way past blaming myself for not being more assertive with my concerns...but...If I had to do it again I would have stayed on top of it and pushed for more information and I biopsy. Best wishes.",
