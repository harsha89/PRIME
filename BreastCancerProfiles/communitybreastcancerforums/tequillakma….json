I was recently diagnosed with DCIS.  The diagnosis came very quickly.  I had my first mammo done on a Tuesday, the second \"closer look\" mammo on Wednesday, the biopsy on Thursday and the result on the following Monday night.  The following week I had the lumpectomy done and I'm recovering now. Of course I'm upset that cancer got a hold of me, but overall I'm glad that it was caught early.  As I'm still in the healing process, I did not yet start radiation (I was told that I would not need chemo) and then of course the 5 years of tamoxifen.  The healing process sucks.  My underarm is swollen, I can't move the way I want,  taking showers is a major undertaking which I need help with, I can't sleep well at night, etc. But I can deal with all of these things.  What I'm wondering is if the deep sadness, anger, shock, fear of another cancer showing up somewhere, the feeling of being completely overwhelmed and the pit in my stomach  will ever go away? ",

Try to stay positive.  I know it's a lot easier said than done, but it is very important.  Hugs",
