My tumor marker (Ca 27-29) just went up.  I am out a year and a half.  It has fluctuated.  Yes, I know it can and I know it is can be inaccurate.  Levels are WNR.   May 07 (right after rads) - 29 Aug 07- 15 Jan 08- 14 May 08- 25 Can you please share stories about fluctuating levels and tell me is all okay!  Thanks.   Sometimes, it's good to hear.
