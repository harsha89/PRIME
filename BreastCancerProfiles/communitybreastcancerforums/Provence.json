All I am aware of is they give a steroid and something for nausea. I just assumed that it would be given intravenously. I appreciate all the info I receive here. I am curious why some have cytoxan and taxotere but not with adriamycin. My MO said I would need all three? Thank",

I'm having further testing on my tissue for hers2 and an echo. He recommends 3 chemo drugs. Adriamycin, cytoxan and taxotere for my best odds against reoccurrence. He doesn't like ports because of further risks, so I will IV every three weeks. This all started Nov 8. They found micro calcification on my mammogram. This is happening so fast. So much info to understand. I appreciate the support Ive found here! Wishing you all a Merry Christmas",
