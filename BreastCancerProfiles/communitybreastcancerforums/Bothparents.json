    "Content": "Bothparents wrote: hi everyone! I just wanted to know whether anyone else has had both of their parents with breast cancer? Dad had a mastectomy 4 days ago and we are waiting for further info. My mum had breast cancer at 49 and survived but died of melanoma. Because they aren't in the same side if the family, there doesn't seem to be much information? Dad is also a Vietnam veteran and his best friend (male also) passed away from breast cancer last year.
