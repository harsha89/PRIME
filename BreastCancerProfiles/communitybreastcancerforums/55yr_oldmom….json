But I have no stage or type.  I was wondering if anyone from NYC, who has already had surgery, has ever been seen by DR. Hank Schmidt from Mount Sinai? He seems to know what he is talking about, except for the fact, that I have had two biopsy, two ultrasounds, one MRI and a Pet scan, but as I mentioned earlier no stage or type. He has told me that until after the surgery, then that's when I will get the results of the type and stage, is this normal?  Thank You. Log in to post a reply",
