I went onto the Susan G. Komen website and called their phone number.  They had many resources where low cost and even free services for women and breast care were available.  It took almost all afternoon but finally I found a hospital about a half hour away that offers those services.  I told the lady my situation and she took my information.  She said it would take less than 2 weeks to get an appointment and she would call me with my appointment time.  I asked her to please tell me how much I can look forward to spending for the US....she told me it was FREE!  I definitly was not expecting that, for I was expecting to pay at a lower cost but not free.  I am a happy camper now and I will keep you updated!

Well, today is the day and I will be leaving to go to the hospital in about 45 minutes.  To my surprise, I am not nervous at all.  I do wish someone was with me but all in all, I think I am doing very well.  I slept good last night.  I think I am just anxious to get it done and over with and see what the report says.  My only concern is that if everything seems ok but I feel that a biopsy is needed, I will be turned down due to not being insured.  I have less power than those who are insured.  I am saying this due to the horrific stories I have heard about tests coming out negative with no biopsy/additional treatment recommended and when the woman says she wants to get a biopsy and it is done, they find atypical cells or cancer.  So these women find their own cancer.  Makes me question who I can trust anymore.  With the doctors knowing that these tests are not accurate, you would think THEY would be the one's stressing additional tests to support the diagnostic test results.  Instead, they put 100% confidence in these flawed tests and are misdiagnosing women who in fact DO have cancer.   SAD! I'll be back later on this afternoon to let ya know how it went!  (HUGS)  ",

      "Content": "Aug 18, 2009 02:04PM - edited Aug 18, 2009 02:06PM by AmyMarie89 Hello everyone I had my test today and the woman tech was very young (early 20's).  I was able to sit up during the procedure which took only 15 minutes.  I explained to her where I felt the abnormalities and she went straight to those areas with the wand.  Lucky enough, the radiologist was actually in the other room reading the images WHILE she was taking them.  The radiologist did not speak to me but through the tech and she said everything looked normal 'so far' but had to finish the report.  My GP and myself should have the results in 24 hours unlike the 2-3 day wait I was expecting. Even thought everything looked ok, the radiologist suggested I should still 'maybe' want to get a mammogram if I still feel questionable or uneasy.  It is up to me to get the script from my doctor.  I found out that the Susan G. Komen Fund will NOT cover a free mammogram if a US or MRI shows everything is ok.  The only way to get one is to have a positive result OR if everything is ok, the radiologist must put on the bottom of the report 'mammogram recommended'.  The tech said she is not sure if the radiologist will do that. If I get a clean bill of health through the US and the readiologist does NOT put anything on the report, I will go to the local YWCA and see if they can help me get a free mammo. If anything, the mammo can either confirm the US's negative results OR save my life. Once I get the report, I will go over it here with ya'll and get some imput of the technical terms if need be. God Bless ",

I am a plus size woman, 37 and have a size C cup.  I am glad that my GP went straight to ordering a US.  My lymph nodes were swollen on the left side but now I feel them swollen on the right as well.  The left pectoral area has a harden cyst/node which I am concerned about even though my GP said I had nothing to worry about.  Since my area of concern is ABOVE the breast and not IN the breast, a mammogram would not pick up any of those areas.  I am still awaiting to hear when my US will be scheduled because I am going through a free-clinic.  It could take up to 2 weeks.",
