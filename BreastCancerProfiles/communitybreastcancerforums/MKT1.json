I have already had surgery, so I can only have chemo in left arm. That is probably why they think I'd be better with a port. Guess I'd like to avoid another procedure....but maybe in the long run, it will be easier with the port. Went to the cancer center this week to look at wigs. They are going to get it ready, (body wave, low lights etc) but they can't cut it until I either buzz my hair or lose more. I wasn't ready emotionally to buzz it, so they will have it ready if and when I need the wig. Next week is port on Wednesday, second chemo on Thursday....sounds exhausting, but we all seem to discover that we are stronger than we think. Hope everyone has an uneventful, restful day....",

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2017 07:17PM - edited Feb 1, 2017 07:43PM by MKT1 I began CMF chemo on Jan 19, 2017. Did not have a port. Arm was sore from chemo IV for about a week. My \"kitchen counter pharmacy\" managed side effects pretty well. I'm scheduled to have a port put in next week, then have second round of chemo the next day. Does that sound doable to those of you with a port? Part of me wonders if I could get through 5 more treatments without a port",
