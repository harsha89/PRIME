She was fine up untill this summer when her skin got covered with cancer bumps, her weight became 77 pounds and she did not even got chemo yet;-((  She looks so little and thin. The doctor put her on Tamoxifen, which worked  5 months, she is weak and is rapidly progressing now, her marker is going up.  She can hardly walk, has difficulty breathing and has a bad mood all the time.  Her eyes are so sad, she told me she does not want to die. The docor said she would not tolerate chemo and that she will start to fade soon and recommends to talk to hospice.  It is very hard for all of us.  The only option is left to take Xeloda. I do not know how we will survive through this.  If anyone can send me encouraging story where xeloda worked wonders or anything else taht is left to take I would appreciate.  Thank you, Nadia Log in to post a reply",

She did not have pains, was not under hospice care, she just decided to go to heaven. Sad story:-((",

For those who are getting treatment, please be strong, do not get disappointed and keep your spirit high.  In my Mom's case, she started treatment too late.  She lost all her weight in Russia within one year; only after she came to US she started hormonal treatment, which kept her alive for two more years.  She did not go through chemo.  So, there are availeble treatments and please fight for your health as much as you can!",

My Mom was tapped this week from the right side and seems like she is breathing better.  On Wednesday, December, 24 we will go to oncologist and discuss Xeloda treatment.  She is taking aromasin.  A few days ago he said to me by phone: 'Sorry, your mother is going to fade and she will  not tolerate chemo'.  Her weight is 77 pounds (was 140).  All her body is covered with metastatic nodules.  Hopefully, Xeloda will work.  Also, my Mom does not have a health insurance, so things are complicated here also.  Her oncologist is very nice, is trying to help out with sample, we will see.  The primary care doctor told me that we prolonged her life for 2 years and that it is time to think about hospice.  Those are scary words.  Meanwhile, my Mom tell she gets weaker every day, she just sits all day on the bed and looks very sad and breathless, tells me she does not want to die, she does not go outside.  My Mom worked as a physician for 40+ years and now she struggles herself with cancer.  I do not work because I take care of her.  And thank you for giving me the list of chemo treatments people try here.I will let you know if Xeloda helps and what is the outcome of it.  Do you think it is worth while getting another opinion?How long would Xeloda work till the cancer progresses?  I have read that it is about 4 months or so.  Please let me know.  All my very best for the holidays, Nadia",
