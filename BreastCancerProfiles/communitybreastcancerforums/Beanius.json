I just had my two month anniv of finding out I have bc and still have many decisions and tx's to go. I think of how I'll feel down the road and I can so relate to the vision you had while you were in the MRI. Sometimes these thoughts get me down and I let the tears come out. That seems to make way for a more positive mood again. It comes in waves every day. I also find that going for a walk helps. I go to the beach and just walk and cry and talk to God. As apple says I have to constantly redefine normal... I so wish the best for you and that the blah feelings will subside again. I just hate to see you feel badly, but I totally understand. I think, follow your feelings and if you need time to not talk about it don't, and if you need to let some tears out then do. I get tired of talking with family about it too. I get into a good frame of mind, or into a good funny movie, my mind totally off it, and then someone will call and want to talk about it and I find I need to set limits so I get enough \"time off.\" Thanks again for your post and I soooooo hope you will feel better soon. With all best wishes, Beanius",

Nice young female tech did the work and I was in and out pretty quickly. The funny part is my rt breast is where the cancer was and the lumpectomy that was done there you can't even notice anything was done, it looks perfectly normal. But my lt breast had two lumpectomies - all B9, but big noticeable scars. I had to explain to the tech that even tho lefty looks scared up, we need to blast righty because that's where the cancer was found. TMarina -- I was wondering how my arm would do, but I was okay with it stretched up, but I did notice itl I really don't like being tatooed, it's another insult to my bod that I just could do without. I am thinking of having them removed later but I'm probably just upset right now - you can hardly see them. I'm going to a lympedema specialist to get advice on keeping lymphedema from occurring.

During the biopsy, a tiny metal clip was put in to ID the spot for when I get mamos and MRIs in the future, so the doctors will know what that spot is. My understanding is that PASH is a benign situation. I also had two lumpectomies on the other breast that showed extensive ADH. I was told this is also benign, but could turn into cancer over 30 years. Since I had stage 2A IDC in the same breast that had PASH, I had a lumpectomy and I am at \"high risk.\" So I am following my radiologist's advice to have mamo's every six month on the breast that had cancer and mamo's once a year on the breast that had ADH ***and monthly self-exam, that is how I found my IDC tumor - mamo & ultrasound were benign - mamos don't detect 20 to 30% of cancers so self exams are critical***. I am also supposed to have annual breast MRI on both. I was told that breast MRI is highly specialized and to be careful about where these are done. I go to a world class cancer center. Mamo's and self exams are critical. I also had a low oncotype dx score of 6 and highly hormonally responsive tumor. My main concern is keeping estrogen from driving any more breast cells crazy. I have recently completed 6 cycles of CMF chemo (since 2 lymph nodes were +) and have 10 of 33 radiation treatments to go. I start Tamoxifen in January to stop estrogen. I'm 53 and have chosen to keep my breasts as I believe my cancer was due to a lifetime overexposure to estrogen (I did not have any children and was still premenopausal) and by keeping estrogen at bay I have a fairly low risk of recurrence. That is my choice and I feel comfortable with it, even though I realize I'm \"high risk.\" I can't say what another person would be comfortable with and I just recommend getting a lot of opinions and doing research. I found the cancer math web site helpful in making my choices. Having chemo + radiation has very similar outcomes, as I understand, to mastectomy. Mastectomy may have given me a few more percentage points, but the chemo + radiation statistics were so similar that this was the choice I felt was right for me. Plus I just hate surgery.",

I got put on these antibiotics to clear up an infection from the axillary dissection that was done at the end of May. The infection is much better, but I'm keeping thrush at bay with a lot of yogurt and acidophilus tabs. Does anyone know of a better way to keep the candida from overgrowing. I've been on antiB's since Tues night, so this is the 5th day and I'm supposed to take them for 10 days - yikes, I'm only half way through, and I'm afraid I'll be overtaken with yeast. If I look okay on Tues (6/29) I will get my first chemo, otherwise I'll have to wait (again). Do you think I need to keep taking the antiB's? I would like to get this darn chemo started (so I can get it ended!!). Any suggestions how to be in best condition for Tuesday when I meet with my oncologist for the go-no-go chemo decision.

I'm so sorry to hear about something in your bronchial tubes. I know how hard waiting is, it drives you crazy. Hope you will be able to start chemo soon and I hope we all get this over very soon. mtf2518, Gail 48, PennStater - congratulations on getting the first one under your belt!

Good work, keep on moving and having a fun life even with this BC stuff going on. tbyrd - Congrats on your first tx, hope you continue to do well. I'm taking vit D and calcium too, thanks for the info on the B's, I'll check into that. I hate those little weekly pill boxes, but I can see they would be helpful especially with my pre-chemo brain. TMarina - Thanks again for sharing your experience. I think I should just try to relax and trust that the docs know what they are doing...yesterday I was wishing for some pre-tx anti-nausea pills since reading all the info on the prescriptions I have was making me feel sick, ha, ha...I love oyster crackers too, good idea. jenweg - hope you are doing well, I am wishing good things for you! algreach - bummer about coffee not tasting so good. I've often thought I could eliminate everything else but coffee, but maybe that will have to go with tx. Good idea for alternative liquids. I hope you continue to do well.

I'll be receiving 6 cycles of Taxotere & Cytoxan, then rads, then tamoxifen for 5 yrs. I thought I was going to start last month but the radiologist found a couple of calcifications in my \"healthy\" breast so I had to have two more lumpectomies on the left and AXLD on the right. I'm still healing from surgery done May 25 but the onc says to start chemo next week. I have a question, does anyone know if starting chemo 2 weeks after surgery is okay? I will have the drain removed the day before chemo start. I was thinking of maybe giving it another week and starting chemo on June 15 ( not that I want to put it of - ha, ha). This is really happening. Is this really happening? Well, let's jump in and get it over with. So many wonderful people have shared their experiences and I'm grateful to them. I hope I can be of help to anyone else going through this. I actually got a hat and a (cheap) wig ordered today. I hate spending money on this stuff, but, I think I'll feel better if I have the stuff I might need on hand. I already bought a lot of things from the list of chemo suggestions to have on hand. Now I can add to that a wig and gel headband, hat, and a sleeping hat. I'm going to get a couple of scarves at the $2 store today too. Whoopie, Splash!",

I'm  planning to donate to locks of love too. Congrats to you for your donation. As for prep, I have a few hats now and the wig coming. I went thru the chemo prep shopping list here on BCO and got a lot of the items I thought I'd need to have o hand. I was supposed to start today but still need to heal, I relate to being emotionally prepared. My start has been delayed a few times now, but eventually I'll start and better yet, get through this phase. mspeggy4 - I haven't started yet but others have told me to keep calling the doc for relief of side effects as they hve many meds to try and each person is unique.

My delays are for different reasons, but it's hard to be all psyched up and then no go. I had a big melt down yesterday. I'm no expert, but I've been told by several oncs that the window is 4 to 8 weeks after surgery. Lauriez - thanks for sharing about your meds, very helpful. My onc didn't recommend a port for me due to that it involves a surgery in and a surgery out versus only 4 to 6 treatments every 3 weeks, I guess the tradeoff wasn't there to warrant it. Janny99 - I agree to try to keep everything as normal as possible is a good thing. Glad to hear you SE's are tolerable. Take care and let us know how you are doing. Julia2 - Glad the Look Good Feel Better seminar went well. I'm going to one of those early July. Jenweg - Congratulations for getting to #2!! Hurray! Hope you continue to get to work and don't get nausea. Mimi9186 - So glad to hear you are feeling better. Hope you find a gorgeous wig next week. Wow a 5 hour drive each day for rads will be a challenge. I'm thinking of going 3 hrs each way for chemo to a better facility than there is locally. DesignerMom - thanks for asking, I had a meltdown yesterday and that's all I could get out. This is a recap of what happened. I went to chemo class on Monday and it set me off. The \"class\" was just me and a nurse. The nurse was very kind, organized, knowledgeable and competent...and she seemed like one of the most depressed people I've ever met. To go through all this stuff about SE's with the grim reaper was a major downer. Then she took me to the infusion room which is extraordinarily drab and has no windows. It just hit home how awful it would be to have treatments there. Then yesterday, the onc in charge of infusions called and seemed annoyed that my surgeon didn't take the drain out last week and she started telling me there's no point in getting the oncotype test and that I have to start next week even if I don't have the results. I have more confidence in my other onc from the cancer center (3 hours away) who ordered the oncotype test. I was weepy in the morning, but by afternoon yesterday, I took myself for a walk and got a cell call from my DH while walking and when I heard his sweet voice I just broke down like a baby and was balling my head off all the way home. He was really nice and came home right after and opened a bottle of wine for us to relax. Quite honestly I have NEVER openly cried in public before. I can only wonder what any neighbors who saw me must have thought. I think I was a good 20 minutes from home when I melted down. I'm seriously thinking of driving 3 hours each way for chemo to the nicer place. The depressing place, all these delays, doctors not saying the same things, all this confusion just caught up with me. I also can't stand when the doctors sound annoyed with me when I am really following all the instructions. So for now, I'm just waiting till I see my surgeon and onc on Monday to see what they say. BTW I was so glad to hear you got past the constipation. I'll take the \"full of prunes\" tip when I get there - thanks for that!",

I'm also waiting for oncotype score - I'll be praying for both of us to have low scores. I looked into the cold caps but decided it was too much trouble for me and that hair loss wasn't that big a deal. I think there's a thread about it on BCO. I don't think the treatment centers like to deal with it. Workmother - good luck with your first tx, I know how scary it is cause I've almost started a few times. So many women have posted success so I can only guesss you and I will be okay too, sounds like you're all prepared. Don't let anyone pooh-poo your needs. I'm finding that my instincts and gut feelings are my saving guides, use the ice! To get on the list I sent a PM to danielas. RS711 - Another of us had this problem and you might want to PM her for a solution. I'm so sorry you are having this and hope it gets better too. Sandiddstn - I would call your doc if you're having pain, I hate to see you suffer when they may have a solution. I started to get an infection where the axld surgery was done last month as the drain just came out Monday. Called my doc last night and got antibiotics started so it's doing better again. Then the pathologist sent the wrong sample for oncotype results so I have to wait again for that. Otherwise I'm doin pretty well and looking forward to starting chemo next week so I can get it over with. My prayers are with all of you each day. Peace, love, health and happiness to you, Beanie",

MRI, MRI biopsy of another lump, transvag US, PET/CT, bone scan all are negative for cancer.) Because 2/6 nodes were positive I will be getting chemotherapy, radiation, hormone tx. (Not sure of all this yet). I would love to avoid another surgery and I'm weighing risk of lymphedema and reduced use of right arm from dissection versus risk of cancer. I work in construction and do a lot of lifting. Any words of wisdom are so much appreciated. Also thanks so much for being here and for sharing so much. Kindest regards to all, Beanie",

I've been super busy with tests and doctor visits and traveling to/from distant test facilities, then trying to catch up on work. Did get happy news that my PET/CT doesn't show cancer has spread! Still waiting for bone scan results. Had my first consult with radiologist and will meet oncologist for first time this week. I should find out fairly soon what chemo and when I start...thanks for being here and for your support. Beanie",

She was stage 4 at dx and never had a recurrence of BC after tx. I am so sorry to hear you got caught in the Chernobyl disaster. Also sorry hear you still have some time alone. I'm glad he will be back tomorrow night. Thanks for sharing about nodes. I am leaning toward the full ax dis as a precaution. I'll just have to make my husband lift anything over 10 lbs - ha, ha! So glad your PET showed no mets, what a relief!!! JennyB - Thanks for your input on the ax dis. I am looking for a way out and will talk to the onc today. My surgeon's nurse yesterday said it's up to me but highly recommended. Darn it! Have fun with your pixie doo. I suppose I'll be joining you soon. I usually have my husband trim the ends of my hair, but now I think I'll let him design me something pixie-ish. Then quickly get a baseball cap! TriciaB - Thanks so much for the info. You sound great and I'm so wishing this continues for you.! I had not heard about ice chips, or cold cap, so I much appreciate. Congrats on 0/3 nodes - hurray!! All the best to you and good vibes. dana14 - Good news, hope all continues well for you. Redbard804 - I don't know about the thread that lists things you need to have ready B4 chemo. I would be interested too if anyone finds this. I'm meeting my oncologist for the first time today so will need to start figuring out how best to prepare. Thank you for any information. Best of luck with your teaching session coming up. LauraM and msbtl -- Wishing you all the best today, let us know how it goes. Sacphotomom - I like your Chrystal light idea. I don't like sodas, and fruit juice is too sweet. I've been trying to find drinks that taste good and don't have bad chemicals in them as it sounds like drinking tons of fluids will be important through this. I was craving almonds yesterday and bought some. My friend says we have to listen to our bodies about these cravings. But if I did that I'd just eat potato chips all day (and peanut butter). Good luck with your hair cut. packjen - You have a great sense of humor, thanks for that! I've always hated my eyebrows, so I'll be sorta glad to let them go. These are the things that can go: eyebrows, nose hairs, those annoying little wild chin hairs, underarms, legs...I wish I could keep my long hair and pubs, oh well, I guess it'll grow back later. I so hope you are feeling well and please keep up the humor. RRmom43 - Thanks for your encouraging post. So much appreciated!!!! DonnaDoodle - Like you I'm finding everyone's posts to be inspiring and encouraging. It is terrible to have to meet like this. I'm so sorry you have to be here, but I appreciate you sharing as it helps to give me strength. fotopet - Thanks again for starting this group. I am so glad for this support group. I think of you May chemo heros all the time and I send you my very best wishes and prayers that all goes smoothly. Hope you have a wonderful day! Beanie",

For years I was getting mamos and the reports said my breasts were dense and they couldn't see anything. I found my 1.1 cm IDC by self-exam. Then when I got to a cancer center, the specialized radiologist was able to see calcifications in my old mamo films that were of concern but which the general radiologist had not seen. I wish with my family history and history of dense breasts that I had been getting mamos at a specialized cancer center, where they are highly tuned to look for early signs of problems. My cancer may have been caught before it went to my lymph nodes, or maybe before it became cancer. Going forward I am doing high risk screening which will definitely be done at the cancer center (MRI, US and mamos). This is an excellent reminder - thank you Aug24!",
