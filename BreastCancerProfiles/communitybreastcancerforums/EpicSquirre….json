This was after mammograms and ultrasound in February, a surgical excisional biopsy of another area in the same breast in March (that one was benign) and surgical follow up and new pain and lumps I found in april. My doc says and I believe it was lucky this one was found at all. My breasts are dense, regular pain/cysts/lumps, and the radiologist thought this also was benign. I'm thankful the surgeon wanted to look at it herself and needle biopsy it to be sure. But yeah, no telling how long it was hiding there. I'm nervous as heck waiting on the MRI (one week wait)to tell us more and see what else might be lurking :( ",

I would run away from that doctor and never look back. Sorry i don't have any specific advice or idea what it is but just wanted to say go to another doctor that will listen better. I'm glad they ruled out some scary stuff like lupus etc, but then giving up andattributing all this to stress seems lame. I wonder about something hormonal at least for part of the symptoms. (So maybe more than one thing going on?) Have her hormones been checked? How old is your wife and what was the benign mass? I am in 49 in perimenopause (told it can go on for years) and have been having the thinning hair, night sweats, hot flashes. Had a \"flare up\" of breast cysts at the same time and a solid mass that was rather mysterious though benign. Lo and behold turns out there was cancer in that breast too -- highly hormone sensitive. Barely caught it. Oh editing to add -- I do have another idea. Maybe an inflammatory reaction not to the clip exactly but to the mass itself. My \"mystery\" mass showed chronic reactive inflammatory changes. The thought later was that whatever was there (by the time they biopsied it it was just dead tissue in the center) my own immune system had attacked and killed it. I was also having some immune issues and low grade fevers last year. Hmm.",

THIS was not painful. Here is how it went for me: The technique they used was a single injection that included lidocaine in the injection, mixed in with the tracer. The injection was given at the edge of the areola. I said I was nervous and my breast is sensitive, so they sprayed a cold numbing spray on a few minutes prior. They said I would feel a prick and that I might feel the fluid going in, there might be a little burning but not too bad. I didn't feel any burning or pain. The prick was really nothing. It did take a solid couple of minutes for the shot, for it to all go in (if you have this done the afternoon prior, they have to use more of it, and the lidocaine adds volume as well) Mostly I felt NOTHING after the initial prick. Twice I did feel kind of pressure for a second or two, like it was GOING to hurt, but then it didn't. My breast now, about an hour later, feels a little weird.. hard to explain, but definitely not painful. Call ahead and ask what technique they use and see if you can find a place that uses this technique of the lidocaine mixed into the tracer.",

My surgery is very early in the morning (I will arrive when the surgery center opens), so they are having me get the radioactive injection the afternoon prior. (The surgeon will also do the blue dye the day of surgery, but after I'm sedated) I'm worried because my breasts are small, dense, painful, and full of cysts. They are sensitive on their best days. I call them my \"autistic breasts\" because of their sensitivity to everything. I've had a lot of fine needle aspirations over the past decade and the only one that hurt was the most recent one just last month on this breast near the nipple. I was cussing and crying on the table. Previous aspirations were painless or virtually painless. I also sometimes get a vasovagal reaction. The fact I'm stressed, haven't been sleeping, I think makes it more likely to happen. Also if the procedure is painful it happens. So of course now I'm also anxious that I'll have that (extremely unpleasant, I feel somewhat traumatized for a couple hours after it happens) This breast has been through a lot this year including a surgical excision. (I had pain in this breast in January and there's so much benign stuff going on in it, the cancer wasn't diagnosed until this month) I haven't been sleeping since cancer diagnosis. I'm crying every day. I can't work. I just feel like I can't take any more.. and the cancer treatments are just starting. All this, combined with the fact I'm having it the day before (so more volume of dye I'm afraid means more pain) I'm stressed out. I called the surgeons office today to ask how this procedure is done. She said it is is near but not in the nipple, it is one injection, and it is numbed. That sounds good I think but I'm still anxious about it. I also told her I'm having a hard time sleeping and they recommended Benadryl or melatonin. Some moments I feel ok but other times I feel like my anxiety/stress isn't being handled. I've never been on any drugs for anxiety or depression. I've never felt like this before. I don't have a psychiatrist or anything. I don't know what i need or how to ask for what I need.  ",

      "Content": "Apr 19, 2017 06:40AM - edited Apr 19, 2017 08:19AM by EpicSquirrel Now that I have the report from the radiologist, I wanted to post some of the text from the report here and ask for any advice. The nurse practitioner at the surgeon's office (the bs was in surgery that day) sent me immediately to get an ultrasound and aspiration because I was in so much pain and had so much swelling right under the nipple, which is just a couple of centimeters away from the incision where the previous mass was taken out. (The excised mass was benign intraductal mostly infarcted tissue with reactive inflammatory and fibrocystic cells, fat, and periphery microcalcifications. Whew!) On Thursday last week the radiologist did an aspiration on the spot to both relieve the pressure/pain and also to biopsy the fluid. She was concerned from looking at it and, as she said, how it has presented, that none of this was showing up on the ultrasounds from February 1 that preceded my surgery, that perhaps this is related to the surgery and might be an infection. So I have been calling my doctors office every weekday since then and they keep saying they don't have the results back. I don't *think* it is a major infection from how I feel -- there is no redness, the \"swelling\" has gone down *a bit* since the aspiration, but I do have a headache and sometimes feel like I\"m running a low grade fever on and off throughout the day (though when I get home and take my temperature it is normal) Is it normal to not put me on antibiotics (she said they need to know what they are dealing with) and to wait this long for results? I logged into my patient portal and was at least able to see the text from the radiologist report from the day of the imagine and aspiration. (I wasn't able to copy & paste with their system so I am typing this from transcription, will try to get it all right): 2 cm from nipple is a thick walled cyst overall measures 2.5 x 1.9 cm and the central cystic portion measures 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.7 cm. The wall is at least 5 mm in thickness and is hypervascular. Numerous additional simple cysts are present. There is an oval hypoechoic nodule at 12 oclock located 6 cm from the nipple measuring 11x9x6 mm. This demonstrates smooth margins but was not documented on the outside ultrasound 2-1-2017. Real time ultrasound guided into the complicated cyst at 12-2 oclock - Fluid complement was completely evacuated yielding 5cc of turbid, partly pussy fluid which was sent for Gram stain, culture and sensitivit. The thickened cyst wall remains in place. (I am adding a note here: After the aspirated this she said she was sorry but it seemed to be immediately refilling.. she and her assistant applied a lot of pressure to try to get it to stop, and put me in a pressure bandage for 24 hours. It does seem to be smaller than it was - and no pain now - but I can tell it isn't totally gone. Now back to her report...) The 11mm oval solid nodule features most consistent with fibroadenoma, considered probably benign. Recommendation is pending analysis of the fluid.  Ok that's what I know. Other than the fact that my breast is now bruised from this experience, has a large scar from the removal of the 4 o'clock mass, is still full of cysts, has a possibly fibroadenoma, and I KNOW from my breasts that I will be in pain in a short time again if this one fills up or the others grow. I am so thankful that I have not been diagnosed with bc, and I know this is a bc forum, but I just CANNOT BELIEVE that no one really seems to know what causes all of this, that there aren't any real treatments or help for benign but PAINFUL and INTERFERING WITH LIFE conditions like this. I feel like whenever I visit someone they are like OMG Maybe it is cancer we have to find out, and then Oh whew it wasn't cancer, go on about your business, and I'm like but I'm still in pain (sometimes literally in tears from the pain), I still have issues :(  I am editing to add: the 11mm likely fobroadenoma I found myself this week. No one seems to have seen it on the February mammo or subsequent ultrasounds. Indeed when I was having the US the tech hadn't touched that area and saidshe was done. I said to the tech: We also noticed a lump here, and showed her. Then she took the images there. Makes me wonder what else is in my breasts that no one has noticed. They are always so lumpy I feel like if I brought every lump/cyst/whatever to a doc's attention I'd need an Ultrasound Unlimited Season pass lol. But seriously, with all of the above, should I be worried that things are being missed? Can this and a 5mm cyst wall thing underneath my nipple, 2cm from a surgery done six weeks ago really be brand new  ",

I'm one year too young and perimenopausal so didn't qualify, but chose to not do the radiation anyway since mine is also favorable -- including low oncotype score, no genetic mutations, er+, her2-, stage 1 My anatomy would also not allow prone positioning or brachy etc.. and where my tumor was had an impact on my decision: left breast, and also some of my lymph nodes would be in the field even though they wouldn't be aiming for them. I asked RO many details about chance of rads induced lymphedema, heart or lung damage, new rads induced cancer, breast fibrosis, etc Radiation does cut chance of local recurrence about in half.

The radiologist thinks it is cancer but the core needle biopsy results are benign. That's why it was discordant. The breast surgeon does not think it is cancer but concurs with the recommendation of an excisional biopsy mainly because this will not go away on its own and may get inflamed/infected again in the future. The surgeon did an ultrasound and we could see the clip that the radiologist put in, in the center of the solid part of lump, where the biopsy was taken. The surgeon showed me that there IS fluid at some of the (smooth) edges. She thinks it is/was a cyst and I possibly bled into it/burst blood vessel and now there's debris in it, and dead tissue (FREAKY!) and it may have been infected (I had been on 10 days of doxycycline prior to the imaging due to appointment scheduling). Thissounds so weird I asked how this happens. She says nothing I did or could do to prevent it, these things just happen?!?! But now that it's in the condition it is, it should come out. Anyway she told me not to worry about cancer. She sees a lot and doesn't think this is it. But of course it will be tested to be sure. I'm having it out on March 2. I'm 48 and it's the first surgery of my life so I'm a little nervous. But happy with her frankness and comforted that it is probably not cancer.",

She took the entire lump but no surrounding tissue, since the breast surgeon thinks most likely it is not cancer. I will have results at my in-person follow up a week from today. It has been quite a stressful two months -- trying to get an initial appointment, being given antibiotics, waiting for mammo and ultrasound, core biopsy, waiting on that result, and then the surgical biopsy. Even with the likelihood that this is benign it has still been a lot of appointments and stress, as well as some physical pain. The healthcare system isn't easy to navigate. Thankfully I have a job that allowed me time off for all these appointments and provides health insurance. I think about all the women who dont have that, the extra worry and stress. Anyway thank you for the advice and greetings. The surgery itself wasn't bad at all, in fact to be honest the core needle biopsy was more difficult and I had about as much pain after! Anyone worrying about a surgical excision, try not to be scared, it was easy. I'll come back to share the results.",

Also she took four core samples. On the phone she said that it was discordant with the imaging/what they expected? Anyway I think you are right that i should just have it removed to be sure -- and also for my own curiosity now haha -- but of course I'm really nervous about what's going on. Re the idea of cellulitis, she originallly thought it was an abscess. But when when tried to aspirate it with a fine needle, no liquid came out. During the core biopsy there was also no puss or sign of infection. Though perhaps the antibiotics handled it? (It was a long wait for the imaging appt and I completed 10 days of doxycycline while waiting",

There's a product called Dream Water that's a little expensive that I love that has melatonin and some light anti anxiety supplement in it as well. Benadryl also helped me, though I know a lot of people don't like it. Also there's a great pinned thread in the \"Not diagnosed but worried\" area titled Anxiety that is worth looking at. I didn't sleep for a couple weeks either. I was better after surgery, felt like something had been accomplished, and then better again after all the treatment decisionshad been made.

I am actually wondering if all of the rads possibilities (LE+heart+lungs+angiosarcoma etc) is worth a net 10-15% decreased chance for local recurrence. That's what I'm wondering about -- if it seems crazy to risk that recurrence rate to avoid these possible complications (since I AM someone who tends to get comlications, and the LE complication in particular would be devastating to me given my mobility issues with my other arm). Also if I did get local recurrence I could still have rads available later. If I do rads now that's closed off in the future.",

The pain can be from a cyst (or other benign lump) itself pushing on a nerve or the tissue around it pushing on a nerve. The pain can be from an infection/abscess (can happen even if not lactating!)

But if you've found a lump and are curious about the next steps, usually it's a mammogram, then possibly an ultrasound and then possibly a simple biopsy of some sort. They may or may not do all of this in one appointment. Not 100% sure what you've already gone through so please forgive meif this is too basic of info. From my experience: For a mammo you will be asked to undress from the waist up and wear a shirt type gown. The mammo is uncomfortable because the kind of squish the breasts, but it doesn't take long and there's no damage/pain after. Then you might leave and someone looks at the film later, or you might be able to wait and talk to the radiologist right away about what was seen. They might want to do an ultrasound (not painful) and perhaps a biopsy. Personally I prefer it all in one go. Ultrasound is not painful and no radiation to worry about. The ultrasound tech won't tell you anything during the ultrasound. You will have to wait again to talk to the radiologist (doctor) about what was seen. Biopsy if it is recommended and if they do it that day might be a needle biopsy where they numb the skin and take a small sample (in my experience with a small needle, after they numb the skin it usually isn't very painful or if it is, not for very long) If there is any pain with your lump now and if it is a cyst, this will actually give you some relief when the pressure is gone right after. You can ask questions at any step of the way and ask what all your options are at each step of the way and you can stop the process any time you want to. If you are nervous just tell them. They will not do any surgery that day, as if you decide on a surgical biopsy that would need to be scheduled in advance, and you have time to get your biopsy results back from the lab and then meet with the breast surgeon to discuss all details options. Put a little snack in your purse in case they keep you there a while. Wear pants so that when you undress \"from waist up\" you are comfy. Sometimes rooms are cold so a scarf/wrap might be good too. Good luck and let us know how it goes!",

She also has set me up to speak with rad oncologist before I decide The main thing is you DO want to decide before radiation, as rads can make future healing/reconstruction harder. But you may NOT need to decide before doing a somewhat exploratory lumpectomy. Also I'm applying for genetic testing, the BRCA gene test which if I get might help me make my decision.
