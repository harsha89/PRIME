Had a mastectomy, Just finished chemo and will be on hormonal drugs. They say I am in gray zone.. wondering why they would not suggest doing the intramammary nodes?? Guess that will be one of my questions. I see others have had that area done.. what is the reason some get that area and others not?",

The MRI was done on 9/15 and was never called by my BS with results. I was told that my appt on Oct 1 was to discuss that. The MRI showed few additional lesions which led me to mastectomy and now chemo. When I met with MO I asked about additional scans and he said that I had the MRI. In my mind the MRI did not show the positive lymph node so was it really good in detecting everything that was there? . He also stated that the scans would not show anything anyway as it was too early. Of course I always have negative in my mind and figure he is not sending me for scans as to not worry me or he isn't telling me something. My BS told me I had no cancer left, all was removed when she did mastectomy and all margins were great. Pathology report freaked me out as I had one positive lymph node out of 17. Also tumor was very agressive, 1.1 cm and showed some lymphovascular invasion. My MO said I was focusing too much on that information and gave me the two chemo treatments that I had to decide on, both being preferred regimens for Stage 2... I opted for TC regimen so that I did not have to deal with heart issues with ACT.. as I have very high blood pressure and a murmur and leaky valve. As always I continue to think positive.... even though now I am dealing with the possiblity of truncal lymphodema. Going for PT and with this tissue expander in its hard to know why they at time seem to swell up more so than other times... Seems to be too much to be going through all at once.

My MRI which picked up additional lesions made the decision for mastectomy easy...but really did not have enough time to decide if I should have had both done.. knowing that I had ductal estacia which they told me was benign in the other breast. Too much to think about and wanting to get it done asap. At least having the chemo first gives you the time to think... and its also killing the cancer so that it doesn't travel.

MO was going to look into it and see if there would be any benefit and what the long term side effects may be of doing 4 vs 6. Were you offered 6? I asked about it as I have seen some people post about doing 6. I also fear lymphodema from the radiation..it ups your chances of getting it. I had 17 nodes taken out...thank god all were negative but that one that scars me to death. I am already seeing a PT for the swelling that I still seem to have under the arm area and chest...not sure if its lymphodema but just trying to do soomehting to make it it not happen.

I really need to start thinking like you. I have been trying to think positive through this whole thing, but there is always one more thing added, makes it difficult. I am guessing that my swelling is in fact the start of lymphodema...truncal. I hope starting PT will have a positive impact on whether I do end up with a diagnosis of it and hopefully its mild and controllable. I was told that having radiation might affect having implants and the PS would discuss this with me later once I know for sure. Were you given the option of radiation or not and was did you need it because of your lymph nodes. I don't know how many cc's they need to put in me, but right now I have had only two fills.. one was at 80 cc and the other was 90 cc. Not sure what was filled during the surgery. I am a C cup...so don't know how many cc's that is. but 700 sounds like I will explode.. Can't imagine them getting anymore liquid in them..seem so tight now.

She also told me to call the LE Physician that I see for the cording and see if she can see me sooner than my late June followup just to rule it out. PS said he didn't think that it was LE. He said it looked more like something that may have happened if I may have bumped it as there is a little yellowish bruising up past my elbow. But I don't remember doing anything to it.

Doesn't this mean that it can be too late by the time that they decide to do a scan. Are there other ways that they monitor, do blood tests reveal anything that they do every some many weeks, months that would lead them to believe the cancer is still there or has spread??",

She tells me it was a good surgery, 10mm clear margins.. small tumor, 11mm, Then I had one positive node, 8mm which she said is samll with extracapsular invasion, but 16 others negative, So she does not think I need radiation to the auxilla area, if they were to do radiation she would do only clavical area where no nodes were removed and the breast.

I thought about it and went back to her in two weeks with a list of questions. She told me that I had only one node positive, with Extracapusulated Extension, but to remember there were 16 others that were Negative(she said the amount of cancer (8mm) was small compared to a lot of others she has treated) She told me my surgery was great... I had 10 mm clean margins. My IDC was small only 11mm. I also had LVI...all of this scared the heck out of me. I was stage 2A, Grade 2, ER+ (98%), PR + (68%) and HER2 Negative. I did TC x 4 chemo... and I am now on Fermara. Both my RO and MO told me that the biggest bang for my buck comes from the Hormonal Drugs. My counselor also talked with me because I could not make a decision. She spoke with the RO to make sure I was understanding things. Counselor told me that if the RO thought that I needed to have radiation she would have told me I NEEDED IT. Plus she told me that my risk of local recurrence is small so radiation would benefit me only a very small percentage. I also worried about lymphedema and the possibility of having it now what would radiation do, make it worse, or if I don't have it (no one can seem to confirm whether I do or don't) would I get it from radiation. Radiation increases the risk of lymphedema. It was a very hard decision but I opted out of radiation.. Maybe if it were three nodes positive I would have said yes.",

Well, it came out orange...yes orange. And I used the same color I used all the time prior to being diagnosed. Just not permanent color. So I had to do something, went back to the store and got a darker brown...now its dark orange... Can't go without wig now! Any suggestions with haircolor??",

Don't want radiation to make anything worse or prevent implants. I cannot do a flap reconstruction, I am too afraid of that and the recovery.

IDC was 11mm with LVI and it was a grade 3. I had a mastectomy with 10 mm clean margins. So yes I feel the same as you. I also did Taxotere and Cytoxan Regimen as opposed to AC+T. (I have really high blood pressure so I didn't want any damage to heart). When I went for consult with RO...she told me my cancer was small.. I asked what pathology report was she reading. To me its big, but she seemed to think it can be a lot larger and mine was small. She told me I had a very good surgery that removed everything with clean margins.. and that 16 nodes were negative which was really good. I am not sure whether she was just trying to make me feel better.. but she did say that she was not recommending that I needed to have radiation, I was in a gray zone. She also told me if I lived out West TC would be the treatment that they would have given me. I was given a choice TC or ACT.. how are we able to make the choice?? I also have back / shoulder pain, I am assuming its from the tissue expander and the way I hold myself. Its not constant. It does go away. They say to worry when the pain is constant. So I try not to worry. I finished chemo on Feb 5th and worry as you do. I started Femara three weeks later and My MO told me that was the biggest bang for my buck. What chemo are you on? Suggestion is to see a counselor at the cancer center, I did and that helped me get through things. I have been told it gets easier each day... Did your MO give you percentages at all? I know he kept telling me not to focus on the node involvement, the grade, the lvi, or the ecn. Its easy for them to say. He also told me to stay of Dr. Google... which I have definitely taken that advice.. no longer searching for answers that I want to hear... just this site and that's about it. Everyone here is so helpful. Good luck with your treatments and try to stay Positive!!! You will do fine!! Karen",

Then an MRI picked up additional lesions which led me to having a mastectomy of my left breast. Pathology came back as Stage 2A,, 11mm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3, Ki 67 at 28%, one node positive and 16 negative. ER/PR positive, HER2 negative. Did chemo, 4 treatments of TC. Gray zone for rads, but radiation oncologist said that I had a very good surgery with 10 mm clean margins. So she was not recommending that I needed to do radiation, but could if I wanted. Opted out since I think I have chest lymphedema, my tissue expander feels like it keeps swelling so PT said it could be, don't think that would mix well with radiation, plus she told me that since I had some many other nodes negative, that was a good thing. So i don't remember the percentages / risks that the oncologist discussed...so I was trying to see if others could share what they have been told.",

You are about the same as me only I had a positive node. How can percentages differ that much? Makes me wonder whether my MO just didn't tell me the truth!!!",
