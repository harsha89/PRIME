I have been fighting severe depression for the past year two years which included a hospital stay due to suicidal thoughts. My mom was diagnosed in October with IDC and had a mast in November.  Then I was diagnosed in December.  It has made it so very difficult to function right now.  I can't trust my decisions because they are clouded by the depression.  I have a really sick part of me that wants this to become invasive and run out of control.  I know that sounds really bad.  I apologize to those women that are dealing with severe cases of BC.  I don't mean to offend anyone with my comments. I'm trying very hard to make it to my surgery date without having to go back to the psych ward.  Ativan is my friend right now.  When I start to get real anxious I need it to calm down.  I hope I get something before the surgery to help me relax.",

It does help to read the posts here.  I know that many of you are going through worse situations and I really hope and pray for you all to keep up the strength and pull through to the other side of this journey of BC.",
