Felt like my skin was badly burned and was being ripped off of my sternum. Right armpit and side of breast was red and swollen.  Knew something was very wrong and went back to mastec. surgeon and went away undiagnosed for infection under the right arm.  (Was told it was my body adjusting to lymph removal.)  Waited 'til next visit with PS who promptly prescribed 10 days of antibiotics.  Felt better after 1st day on meds. Lesson learned...be aggressive. FYI, an RN representative with my insurance company told me pain management was a VERY important part of healing and not to worry about addiction at one month after surgery. ",
