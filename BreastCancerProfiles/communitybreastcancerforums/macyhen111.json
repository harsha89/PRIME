I didn't have a lump that could be felt by my Pc Dr. I just had some pain. I was to begin my chemo on the 28th, but a pet scan showed possible mets in my hip and clivus bone in my head, so now I have mri's, bone scans, and bone biopsies scheduled for all next week. We have to keep praying and trusting that we are going to beat this. I have found such comfort coming here and talking to the other survivors on these boards. Keep your head up and try to stay as positive as you can.",

Just the taste buds are shot on treatment day, I am 3 weeks on 1 off. I still have hair on head, but cut it short and I love it. No eyebrows or lashes but I have learned to put on make up.

My chemo nurse was able to get blood once during an infusion. Strange to me because they put the port in for chemo and also blood draws as my veins are hard to use.

I've never known anyone with Bc. I got my port put in on the 21st and I begin my chemo tomorrow. My onc prescribed zofran and phen for nausea. I don't know what to expect with chemo and I am scared. I don't mind losing my hair, I just don't want to feel sick. Should I take the nausea meds before I go for the chemo, or should I wait until I start feeling nauseated. I have seen a lot of post mentioning Claritin, what is it for and does it help. I have also seen that some of you request ativan, does it help. I am so confused, any and all advise will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance !!",

I got mammos every year and was told my left breast was dense, so they did ultrasound and found a cyst, funny it is in the same place my cancer was 2 years later. The mammo in between was supposedly clear. Soon after that one (which was last year in March) my breast started hurting. I told pcp he did manuel and said everything was fine. He did last manuel on 9/19/12,said no lumps everything fine. I was dx on 10/24/12. And now the bc has met to my right hip. Sigh!!!",

I have hope and I will always have faith that The Lord will see me through this journey. I used to ask why me? I lost my mother, father, sister and brother at a young age. When I asked the Lord please don't take my only remaining relative, my brother he did. But through all of that I have never questioned why. I just know that I was strong and never lost my faith. So no matter the outcome of this journey I am on, I know I'll be alright. I have my moments but then I try to think of all the positives in my life.
