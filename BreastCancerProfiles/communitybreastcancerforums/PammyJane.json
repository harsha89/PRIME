During Radiation, I felt so good that I  panted and fixed up our the church! But for about 6 months,Slowy I have been having pain under my arm. It feels like someone pushing a shovel in it. Then it feels like I was swelling from my breast, going around my back. It took about 4-6 months to get to my back. As it would get to a new area, as it moved torwards my back, it would hurt.  The skin feel kinda mushy, but not really noticable. I went to my breast Dr. to see what was going on. He just said it was nerves and scar tissue. I was still concerned, and went to my Chemo Dr. He didn't help.   About a week and a half ago, I bent over to make up my bed. I had a sharp stabbing pain in my chest, at little above where my breast was. It was the worst I have ever felt. Since then I can't talk loud, take a deep breath, turn my head to the right, bend over, eat pee, etc. with out getting those sharp stabbing pains. My son came to get me a hug, and he barley touched me, and the sharp shooting pain happened, and I yelled! Now he's scared to touch me. I layed down in bed and when that pain hit, I couldn't move it was so intence, and yell \"HELP ME!\" Even though no one was in the house. Sometimes it feels like I'm bleeding under my arm even though I not. Finally, my breast Dr. is giving me a CT scan, and other test next week. Then he set me up for Physical Therapy. Has anyone else have these pains?? Dx 12/12/2009, ILC, 2cm, Stage IIB, 4/16 nodes, ER+ Log in to post a reply",

I'm kicking him out, and getting a new one! He's been really a \"B\" id you know what I mean! The sharp stabbing pain stopped in my chest. PRAISE GOD! But it moved to the back of my underarm. So when I move it certain ways, there's sharp stabbling pain. What can I take for it?",
