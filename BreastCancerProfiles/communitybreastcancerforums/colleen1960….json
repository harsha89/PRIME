Colleen Tricia:  I also had reconstruction on the rt. side.  They put the tissue expander in.  I had one drain which I was very neverous about, but it was relief when it came out.  I have seen the PS twice for a fill up (still sounds so werid) it felt a little strange, but it did not hurt at all.  I have about 3 more fill ups to go.  But they did tell me that since I am getting chemo I could not get the permanent expander put in until 6 to 8 wks. after my last chemo treatment.  Sorry I not sure about the radiation part, but I am sure someone out there will be able to answer your ques. on that.  If I can help answer anything else, please don't hesitate to ask.  Did they say when you would start treatment?  When do you meet with the onco? I know this is a hard time for all of us, but what I am trying to do is take one day at a time and I know we will get through this. Colleen",

Talk  later, Colleen",

I was so proud of him.  It is amazing when you are 10 and you are so sure that this is what you want to do he told me he would give up all his other activities.   I was even more proud of my husband.  They needed another character and my son asked him to take part.  He was equally fantastic and I thought it was such a special memory that they both will be able to cherish.

I was so looking forward to Thanksgiving, but my mom was admitted to the hospital last night.  She is 87 and God love her she is unbeliveable.  She has had so much going on in the last couple of mths.  She lives in Florida and she lost her house and everything in it with one of the hurricanes over the summer.  Then she was so upset about me and came and stayed with us to try and help.  She was just starting to get things back to normal and get back to Florida when she had difficulty breathing.  They say she has fluid in her lungs that they need to get out and hopefully that will make it easier for her to breath.  But it was very lucky my sister was in Fl. and she took her home to NJ so we will be able to take care of her here.  If you guys would not mind, I know everyone is going through a lot, but please keep her in your prayers.  Well I will let you know what happens and I hope all goes well for everyone who has started chemo or will be starting this wk.  Happy Thanksgiving To Everyone Colleen",

Brenda:  You can ask your Dr. to prescribe something for you.  They may be able to give you something to take the edge off a little. I will be away for the next two days.  My mom is still in the hosp.  We are hoping she will be out tomorrow, but if not I will spend the day with her in the hosp.  Be Well & Enjoy Your Holiday, Colleen",

Cindarellacleans:  Seems we are the same age.  I am on a different treatment, but I have to give meyself (or should I say my dh) neuopgen shots every day for 7 days after the treatment.  Do you give them to yourself?  or do you go to the dr.?  I find that if I take the shot out approx. 30 to 45 minutes before I give the shot it warms it and does not hurt so much.  Also I was told to take them only in the stomach.  I did have some muscle and joint pain, but not like you described.  My 3rd tx is Mon. 12/22.  It just seems like you start to get the strength and it is time to start all over again.  I go for tx every 10 days.

Good luck to anyone going today for tx.  I will let you know later what happen at the drs. Colleen",

My sister told them we were having a cancer survivor party and they apologized and said just to keep the noise down a bit.  I guess somebody did not like our singing LOL.  My mother said in her 87 years she had never been to a party where the police were called.  She was great, she stayed at the party until midnight!!!!!  I hope everyone else is doing well and a nice weekend.  The weather is GREAT Colleen ",

Simvog on finishing your chemo.  You must be so happy.  Another big step completed Hope everyone had a nice weekend.  I was on a school trip with my kids on Friday.  Very long day, we left the school at 5:30  am and did not get back until 10 pm.  I was so happy that I was able to do it.  They competed against other schools in music and then spent the rest of the day at Great Adventure in NJ.  I am happy to say the school did very well they took 1st place in all three categories.  But it was a big test for me to be able to do all that walking and not feel like collapsing.  I am so glad to see that everyone seems to be doing well and that everyone is talking about growing their hair and dyeing their hair.  What a difference a few months make!!!!  It is wonderful to see the new pictures.  We have come a long way!!!! Hope everyone has a great week!!  School gets out in a few weeks and then we can finally go on a vacation. Colleen",

I will go in for all my testing.  In some ways I can't believe it will be a year since my diagnosis.  It's like some days if feels like it was yesterday and others a life time ago.  I can't explain it.  The Tamoxifen or SE from chemo has really been bothering my feet lately.  I don't know what is causing it, maybe a combination of the weather also (very humid).  But I have been getting some really bad pains in my feet.  Anyone else experiencing that?  Tomorrow is Friday already, I hope you all have a great weekend.
