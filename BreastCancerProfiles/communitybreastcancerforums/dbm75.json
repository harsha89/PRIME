Had my lumpectomy and snb on 1/15, then took a few weeks to meet with two RO's and two MO's for 2nd opinions on what type of treatment they'd recommend. Wanted to make sure I made the right decision on the chemo or no chemo question, and got definitive \"no's\" from both MO's (also got \"no's\" from my two RO's and my breast surgeon, tho they were quick to say it is the MO who should have the final say and whose opinion should carry the most weight because that is an MO's area of expertise). So on to rads I move with much more confidence in my decision to skip chemo. Had my consult last week with my RO, and my planning session tomorrow (Tuesday 2/19). I guess that's when I'll get all the prelims taken care of, then it'll be about a week or so, and I'll get a \"dress rehearsal\" to be sure all is as it should be, then I'm good to go. So I'm guessing I'll be starting the first of 33 (which includes boosts at the end) the first week of March. I've been told to expect it not to be too bad in the beginning, that it's cumulative, and will see more SE's as time goes on. This forum and the others on radiation have been very helpful in giving us newbies an idea of what to expect. My RO, thank God, is only a few minutes from my house, work, and across the street from my kids' high school, so I'm very thankful for that, given how much I'll be there over the next 6 1/2 weeks! That is the reason I chose this RO over the other....all things being equal with both....the other was a much further distance. Other than the distance factor, I liked them both a lot. Now I'm hoping I can get a decent time slot for my daily visit, since I plan on working through these as long as I can. I've been told that can vary, depending on how fatigued, etc., you feel towards the end. Since I work in a school, I'm hoping to be able to do this after school each day, but that'll probably be a long shot since I'm guessing all the later-in-the-day slots are the first to be filled. But we'll see. I'll have to keep reading up on this to see how things are going for everyone else and to get tips on bras, creams, etc. My RO suggested the Aahh Bra, or something like that (may have the spelling wrong), which is available at Walmart, and not even as pricey as my own regular bras, which I can no longer wear once I start rads since they are underwires, which are no-no's. So I look forward to keeping up with you all as we start this radiation journey together!",

With an Oncotype score of 15, I'm in \"low\" zone, but closer to the high end of that. My first Oncologist said no chemo based on risk/ benefit ratio. And I wanted a second opinion so I can be more confident in my decision to do or not to do chemo. So we'll see if this new one agrees. When my BS delivered the Oncotype score to me she jumped right into a flurry of discussion about how I'd see a radiation onc, decide on a radiation plan, then be back to see her for my follow up Mammo in three months...not even a hint of chemo possibility....just assuming that's how I'd go. But while I know my BS is an expert in Breast surgery/Breast Cancer (and that's all she does, so I'm sure she knows what she sees and has seen it all) I want to hear it from a MO, in fact from 2 MO's, to feel totally confident in my decision. Also, while I've had every test imaginable (mammos, diagnostic mammos, ultrasounds, MRI, more ultrasounds, BRCA (negative) and OncotypeDX), I didn't have the PET scan. I wonder if I should have? I was node negative, clean margins, and no indication of LVI according to my lumpectomy/SNB path report, so I'm guessing they think it hasn't spread. Is this why no PET scan? Or do some patients get it regardless? A question for my MO, no doubt. But just wondering if anyone else out there had a PET scan despite a negative node and negative LVI report, and if so, why? You just worry that despite everything positive you hear, and I'm thankful every day of my optimistic results so far, that there could be stray little cells out there that are so miniscule that they are able to hide from everything and everyone. (I am, after all, a grade 2. And despite my Stage 1a classification, the grade 2 makes me nervous. Tho the mitotic rate was a 1). Thus the chemo question: Is 9% risk of recurrance without chemo and only a 3% benefit with chemo, worth the risks to my long term health? It's not about wanting to avoid going thru the horrid short term side effects, I know those can be miserable, but many of those are just that, short term, and will go away once treatment is over. I can get through that. It's about the more serious long term effects....side effects that never go away even tho you're done, heart issues, even other cancers that chemo can put you at risk for. So just wondering what has factored into others' decisions here.",

Because I had just one node removed in my lumpectomy and SNB yesterday, and I'm feeling better today, I realized after reading your post that I'm not being a good patient....I'm probably moving around and doing way more than I should. I was thinking that because it was just one little node, I don't have to worry. I'm glad I came across your advice. And I don't know my path results yet, either (that won't be back till next week) so I'm not even sure what's in store for me treatment-wise yet, or if I'll even need more surgery. Hopefully not, but the way I'm going, I don't want to add LE to the platter unnecessarily! So thank you for the heads up.",
