    "Content": "Momasaurus wrote: Hi lovely ladies, I just got results back from my core needle biopsy. I have what's called a Fibroadenoma with ADH. They have also added that ADH is within the fibroadenoma and not else where. I have been asked to have the lesion excised for more detailed study. I am looking for people who have had the same experience. Also just curious if anyone who went through the same was diagnosed with cancer some time later? I am a 32 year old with two small children. I have no family history and absolutely no risk factors for cancer (BMI at the low end of normal range no alcohol use, no smoking, no BCP use, no family Hx. It scares me alot to think that I am at an increase risk for cancer now. Log in to post a reply",
