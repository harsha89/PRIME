Â I'm grateful for friends and family, I just don't want to do this anymore. Â I know it's only the beginning and theer is a long road ahead of me and I will get thru this, I guess I'm just having a bad day. Â Everyone says I'm strong and cheerful with a great attitude. Â Not true I'm weak, scared, pissed and over this charade I'm putting on for everyone's benefit. Â I want to plan my annual trip to Disney not my trip to the mo.

Sam I went wig shopping tonight, it was not the easiest thing, a good friend of mine who just finished her chemo came with me for support. I ultimately picked one, not really jumping for joy but it will do. The surprise purchase was a black simple ball cap that had really straight hair sewed inside in the shape of a long bob, looking like I flat ironed my hair! It reminds me of the comedian Gallagher, he had a hat like this. It was so cool, comfortable and looked nice. I see me using that more than anything to run to the store etc. I feel a little better about all of this! Â  All I can say is One day at a time, you need to do things at your pace when you are comfortable. Â I spoke to the chemo center today where I will be spending the next 20 weeks, and they were so nice, and really made feel good. Â Heck they even told me the first thing you do at treatments is fill out a menu choice for the meal they serve you! Â Plus snacks and drinks are available, I may gain weight!",

Â Hope you have a fabulous time and fill us in when you get back! I went for blood work for pre op today, had to use my right arm now, which usually is terrible. Â I was worked up a little about it, but the tech was great and got it on the first try. Â That was a plus for me! Â  I needed this win because when I went to shower this morning, I saw where the ps had pulled off the scabs, it looked like I had flesh eating disease, it was beyond anything I thought, and I completely lost it. Â Hubby to the rescue, and after putting everything in perspective, I understand the need for the surgery to get rid of this Â and pull everything closed. Â So I am actually glad for this surgery, I just hope the healing goes better this time. Also, had my appointment for Monday with mo pushed out till Thursday, because oncotype was not back yet. Â Let's play the waiting game.... Â  Hope everyone gets a win this weekend!",

I had my port placement yesterday, I went in very optimistic that it was gonna be a piece of cake. Well it was no cake I ever want again! It started off fine except for the darn IV not playing, but when I woke up in Recovery all hell broke loose. I felt terrible, I kept thrashing around, I couldn't stop coughing. My somach hurt then I got sick and had issues with the other end as well. It was awful and very embarrassing! I just hurt all over! They couldn't figure out what was wrong. They did an EKG, chest X-day and an echocardiogram all which were normal. They were going to admit me, they had four different people try to draw blood, after seven failed sticks they gave up. By then I was feeling fine, and begged them to go home. After a while they let me go and I feel fine except for my neck which is killing me! The dr said I was thrashing around through the surgery, so obviously I had some weird reaction to the anesthesia. When I had my last two surgeries under general I was fine, this was just some sedation, apparently it was not for me. I got there at 11 am and didn't leave till 6 pm! This is not the typical experience for port placement but apparently nothing about me is typical. Hope chemo on Tuesday goes better!",

Â Lately I find myself looking at people when I am out to see if they have a wig on, or one boob, or are bald, almost to validate me going out and not being the only to look like this. Â I'm so ashamed and certainly don't wish this on anyone, but I'm jealous of those I see that I think are ok and I'm suffering with this. Â The thing is just because they look ok, I dont know what they are going through, so I try to keep that in my mind. Â But when I see a big boob woman with a low cut shirt grrrr boy am I jealous and sad! Got my Port put in on Friday and Tuesday I will try this sucker out for the first time. Â Petrified to say the least, too many unknowns for a control freak like me, Â I know many people get steroids and other meds to take the night before, all I have is Ativan, zolfan. And Emla cream. Â Def taking that Ativan, I know what to do with Emla not sure about zolfan. Â Also bought some Claritin for the nuelastra shot the next day, not sure when to take that either. Â I actually got one that dissolves so in case I get sick, it will be in my system. I had my long hair cut short in a cute curly bobish mess, the problem is curly wigs are so poofy and fake looking! Â I settled on one that looks like I flat, ironed the front and left the back curly, somewhat doable. Â My fav purchase is a black ball cap with hair that hangs out the bottom, while it is straight, again i could have flat ironed, which I did on some occasions. Â I can see me running to target etc., with this on vs futzing with the wig. Â I bought all kinds of skull caps, scarves, and a halo of little curls to peak out from beneath any hat, so I am physically ready, mentally... Not so much. Â No sure if I'm going to shave or what, I'm not sure I'm strong enough for that, although the clumps scare me. Â Did you ladies do it yourself or go somewhere. Â This is the part I'm dreading terribly. Â Thanks for listening. Â I'm usually in the February chemo thread, but I was lurking for some experienced opinions... Â Wishing everyone a great week!",
