Really struglling with the \"burning\" pain that is all the way down the leg in different places now and then - mostly burning ankle, sometimes the thigh, and quite often the butt.  Sometimes the whole leg feels \"dead\" although it is otherwise perfectly fine - ie I can run/walk stretch etc bu the pain is just there. Have given up on normal painkillers that certainly don't work at night and have my first prescription painkiller (endone) -  to try tonight. - here is hoping I get past the early hours of the morning - I could do with a reasonable night sleep! Scan and blood test again on monday to see what's going on.... So would also love to hear what works as the neurofen and panadol osteo are not enough. Nanalinda - I like the idea of no pain.. it is amazing how it influences one.",
