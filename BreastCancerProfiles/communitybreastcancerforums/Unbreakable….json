I asked my breast surgeon if there was a correlation between Vitamin D and breast cancer because I had read some articles on it.  I don't think it's conclusive yet, but she said there is an impact, but talk to my oncologist.  I asked my oncologist and she said no, it only affects your bone density. I'm just curious to know what your oncologists say. Thanks! ",

It stinks that it's just been a year.  These cells have obviously grown a little before then, since I felt it in May.  My mastectomy was July 29, 2015.  Before cancer I ate well, worked out, don't smoke, I don't drink, I didn't sleep as well so I've improved that.  After all the surgeries I've gotten back into my routine of being healthy.  I'm glad it's not cancer, but it's hard because I don't know what else I can do to try and prevent any of these cells.  There's no history in my family.    It's right on top of my implant, so I'm hoping nothing happens to the implant.  My ps did a good job making it match my other side.  Can any of you share your experiences with the surgery and an implant, and recovery time? I'll ask my surgeon this, but wondering if anybody knows the answer.  If you have atypical cells there's a higher chance of getting breast cancer.  If you've already had breast cancer does that null and void that stat out?  I went a little backwards and got cancer first.  My friend said, well God answered our prayers, there's no cancer.  We just didn't know to pray for no atypical cells.  There's so much I continually learn about this disease.

By the afternoon on day 15 my head got really itchy so I decided to wash it in an attempt to soothe the itch and tenderness. That is when the bulk of it fell off, leaving some patches. So I got my husband to shave it off for me . My family all got a turn to rub my head. We laughed until we cried, not sure why. But it felt good afterwards. I find it really hot when I try to cover it up but get cold when I leave it wide open. Hoping to find a happy medium soon. I understand the anxiety that comes with this. I was there.

Keep us updated as you go through your journey. Fatigue and bone pain has been kicking my butt for the last couple of days. Been taking tylenol which takes the edge off but it is the annoying headache that keeps coming back, that is really messing with me, ugh! I think I will try the claritin regimen the next round if my MO clears it seeing that I also have lupus and to watch meds I take. I am learning to accept help and keeping my bum on the couch. It is the weekend and next week is March break (at least in my neck of the woods). Here's to a managable SE, and a great family time🤗.  ",

Sometimes I put on a front for them and my husband as I do not want them to worry too much. But honestly, I just want to scream sometimes. I had infusion number two yesterday. I am managing well with minimal SEs. I am getting paranoid wondering if the meds are working or even if they were properly compounded or infused. Shouldn't the the SEs get progressively worse? Even the metallic taste did not happen this time. I am not complaining but I just want this to work so bad. In the meantime, I am keeping up with my hydration and rest in anticipation of the onset of SEs especially that I am just about to get my nuelasta shot. I hope everyone is doing well despite the circumstances.",

I went to a fabulous program yesterday, \"Look good, feel better\". It was nice to get together with fellow warriors to learn about skincare regimen and makeup tips on this journey.

Fingers crossed that it will go as planned because since the last treatment the side effects have been ongoing... flu like symptoms, stomach issues, taste buds out of wack, body aches, puffy eyes, fatigue, hot flashes, etc. Keep your heads up.

DebraC, good luck with your treatment. Day 4 post 1st chemo coming to a close. So far the best day since infusion. I am up to about 30 minutes of light household chores before fatigue set in. Seriously, this fatigue is no joke. And the night sweats. They are wild. Thankful that there has been no need for anti nausea meds, though they are on hand just in case. Seems the dexamethasone and granisetron kept vomiting and nausea at bay. As for pain, finally broke down and took an extra strength tylenol today for the bone pain (neck, hips, thigh) from nuelasta. Will definitely do this earlier in subsequent treatments. The pain was not bad but why be in discomfort if you don't have to? Eating...I cannot stop eating. Yogurt, applesauce, shrimp, beets, broccoli and carrots. Nothing taste good because of the annoying metallic taste but I am always hungry. I have been drinking at least 2l per day. I miss fresh fruit. Were you guys told to avoid fresh fruit? A fellow warrior at my treatment mentioned it to me. Still a little constipated. I will definitely start the senekot earlier next round. Anyone had their period delayed? I had one scheduled to start Mar 1 which it did. However, was over by March 2. Did chemopause set in? Does anyone know about when nail changes will begin to appear? I think I dread this more than my hair falling out. Good luck with your treatment everyone 😀",

So much so I forgot my password to this site and could not figure out how to reset it🤣 Groggy, foggy and achy. And last not forget the constipation. Got to figure this out for the next round. Senekot does not work. Hydration does not work. I am so proud of you and inspired by all for fighting through this. It will get better. 🤗 JAG, continue being supportive to your wife. I know you just want to fix this but it takes time. Just be there. Simetimes there is nothing you can do at the moment.
