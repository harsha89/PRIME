She went through chemotherapy and a mastectomy. After treatment, she went into remission and stayed that way until about 2.5 years ago. She was having trouble breathing and went to the doctor where they discovered she had developed lung cancer.This was being treated with hormone therapy. Soon after, possibly 6 months or so, she discovered the bone mets. The pills and hormones that she has been taking kept the lung/bone cancer from progressing up until now. Last week, we got the news that it has spread into her liver. They've caught it 'early' thanks to her regular appointments and are discussing the type of therapy today. Most likely she'll begin chemo again.Â  She's scared, we're scared. We don't really know what to do. It's devastating news and I guess I just don't know where to go for support. What can I expect? How can I help?",
