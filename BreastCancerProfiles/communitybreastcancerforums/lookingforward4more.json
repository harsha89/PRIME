Both came back as ductal invasive carcinoma, one was grade 1 and the other was grade 2. They rated them at less than 1 cm. Pathology states both PR+ and ER+ and Her2 -. KI-67 was a 3 on tumor one and an 8 on tumor two. Went for a breast MRI and the left breast is clear, but they think there is a third tumor in my right or one of the tumors is larger than 1 cm. Pet scan done and all clear, no visable lymph node involvement. I am scheduled for a right mastectomy (due to more than one tumor) and reconstruction w/implants. The team I met with included an oncologist and radiation oncologist. They are recommending chemo even if my lymph nodes remain negative following surgery. I am concerned about chemo. Do you think this is standard? I am so scared, depressed and sad. Surgery is in nine days! I am 46 and pre-menapause.

This side is actually doing okay...ever so slight swelling only when I am in really hot and humid climates. NOW...my left arm...I had only a sentinal node biopsy and prophy mastectomy. HOwever I had a blood clot from my port in 1/08 and its been a bit swollen ever since. They are not quite sure its really lymphodema but the tech measured it and it is 1.5 cm larger than my right (dominent) arm. My hand swelled up at disney last week (previous post) but went down fairly soon after. I am trying to prevent this from getting worse. Does anyone have any experience with blood clot caused swelling/lymphodema? Should I wear the garments a few hours a day or all day. I work in a fast paced enviornment and would really like to wear the sleeve when I get home for a few hours. I am also scheuduled for a series of therapy massage in July. Any advice would be SO appreciated. FYI...I got all my sleeves and gloves for free through a grant from the Komen Foundation. Thank GOD! They are so expensive. ANother worry is a family cruise that we are invited on in December. I remember my mom used to swell up a bit on cruises and I was wondering about this.
