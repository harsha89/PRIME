Starting about 5 days ago I had shooting pains in my left breast, and they went away yesterday, and this morning I noticed skin puckering in my areola, right above my left nipple. The puckering for the most part goes away after my body adjusts to a temperature change, but there is a line indentation that is there that isn't going away. I don't have any family history of cancer, and I have had yoyoing weight, but I'm panicking. Dr. Google is not helpful for that. Log in to post a reply",
