Hope to hear from others who have chosen to fight this battle naturally.  I did have surgery to remove my right breast as my tumour was very large (9cm) and very aggressive and I also had Paget's disease in my nipple from cancer cells that had broken away.  Apart from that though I have only used diet, juicing, supplementation, exercise, meditation and visualisation for my treatment protocol.  I met with an enormous amount of opposition from the medical profession, family and some friends who thought I was completely bonkers for not having chemo and radiation, but as I told them it is my body and my choice, no-one else's......but here I am 13mths after surgery, with all my scans showing no cancer.  I feel so grateful to have reached this milestone, considering the oncologist I originally spoke to, when weighing up all my treatment options, informed me that I would be dead in 1 to 2 years time if I didn't do chemo, etc.  I would love to hear what others have done naturally and if they met with the same opposition, and how their treatments are working out.  Positive vibes and happy thoughts to one and all.  Kazza xx Dx 6/7/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 5/24 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
