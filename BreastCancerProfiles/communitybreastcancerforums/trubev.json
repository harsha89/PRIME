The cuts on the fingers are another headache but I bandage my fingers & use silvadine or ointment I get from the dermatology office where I work (lucky me).  I'm not a happy camper but it helps in the healing process.  I've gone thru hundreds of knuckle bandages (got 6 big boxes from the girls at work).  Like I said, lucky me to work in a dr's office.  You can't even buy the large boxes in a drug store.  Do what works for you but keep on top of it.",
