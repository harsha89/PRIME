At 28 I had just had my son, it was October and I got the urge to start checking- found lump went in for an ultrasound, they found something so had a mammogram. Radiologist found something so I had a 5mm lump removed that had precancerous cells in it. That's all that was done though.  Fast forward a couple years-  this week I found another lump same breast... my nipples have changed color over the last year, I just assumed it was something to do with getting older though but you start googleling and terrify yourself. I really don't know about that though. Needless to say my doctor is getting me in tomorrow to check it.   Log in to post a reply",
