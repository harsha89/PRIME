    "Content": "JanW wrote: I was recently diagnosed with Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia, the precursor to possible Breast Cancer.  I saw an oncologist last week who'd like to put me on Tamoxifen in an attempt to halt the progression of atypical cells.  And after reading the side affects of Tamoxifen, I'm a nervous wreck.  I'm wondering - should I wait to see if this turns into cancer before utilizing the Tamoxifen or should I be pro-active and start taking it now - even though the health concerns are definitely there.  I'm 46 years old and have 2 teen daughters.  I worry about not being here for them due to a blood clot to the brain or lung, or even endometrial cancer.  I realize there is nothing that anyone can do to change the risks of this drug, but any words of wisdom would certainly be appreciated.  Thanks, Jan Log in to post a reply",
