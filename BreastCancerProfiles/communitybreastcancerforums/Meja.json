I also believe that MBC patients with an outcome of NED after years of treatment, inspire and motivate researchers and oncologists to keep studying the biology of this disease and looking for new targeted treatments, that match the individual cases. This is what we should hope for sooner than later, new tailored treatments, and for this to happen we need more research within the field of MBC. Take care all, Meja",

My MO is very diligent, so she wanted me to move on to TDM1. TDM1 is the recommended second line therapy for HER2+++ MBC (at least in DK). She says, she has plenty of additional approved treatment options 'in the drawer'. We did briefly touch upon possible clinical trials for the future, so she set me up to have a sample of my tumor tissue screened to see if LiPlaCis from Oncology Venture could be relevant and 'added to the drawer' for the future - I will know within a month or so, whether this is an actual option to consider looking forward. All types of MBC are screened (HER2 +++/neu ER+/ER- etc). But for now, we agreed on sticking with approved products. Hope all is well with your wife Leslie.",

I had my second infusion 10 days ago; experienced some fatigue, but not as bad as the first time, and a few days of constipation. Also some of my liver numbers were slighty elevated after the first infusion, so I am glad to hear that this shouldn't be a point of concern I hope we all have success with our treatments. Take care.",

Received the information yesterday that my pet/ct scan from last week shows slight progression of bone mets. Consequently, MO switched me to TDM 1 and I received the first infusion yesterday. Prior to this I have had 6 months on Navelbine H+P - was hoping I could have stayed stabile on that regime a bit longer. I am feeling ok physically, but a bit overwhelmed about the news of slight progression. Navelbine did give me a lot of gastrointestinal side effects, hoping that TDM 1 will have less of these. I will be looking further into and following all the valuable information on this thread. Hoping this treatment will get me to stable. Otherwise, MO did say she has more in the 'drawer'. Meja",

Today I got the results from my first scan after having started on Kadcyla/TDM1 late October 2018; i.e. after 3 infusions. The CT scan showed healing of bone met, and the PET showed no metabolic activity, - yeah! Also my blood work was normal today, - so I continue on this treatment, which up till now has left me with fairly mild side effects, i.e. some fatigue and GI issues the first week, but with treatment intervals of 3 weeks it has been manageable. It is always stressful waiting for scan results, and especially after having switched to a new treatment. Best wishes to all of you waiting for scan results.",
