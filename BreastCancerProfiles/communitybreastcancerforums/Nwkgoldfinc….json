I'm going to see the fertility specialist this week, and am getting a second opinion, as well. Bluekoala - it sounds like you and I are in a very similar boat in terms of age and proposed treatment. My med oncologist said the same thing - chemo first. On the one hand I like to hear other people's feedback and on the other it undermines my confidence that I'm being told the best course by my doctors. For instance, a lot of people have been asking me about radiation and I'm like JEEEEZ, I DON'T KNOW. the way the doctors (breast surgeon and med oncologist) explained it , the chemo, then surgery will be the most effective for a 100% cure and that's reason enough for me. I'm hoping when I go to the city for a second opinion it's more or less on point with what they are telling me here in NJ, because I did get a good feeling about the doctor here. But, we'll see. I'm not going to shut off an open mind to another approach. I think I just want some sort of plan to grasp onto so I'd rather it coalesce around what I am gradually getting used to!  ",

I'll cut to the chase: I am doing one cycle of egg harvesting after talking to my oncologist again, as well as a second opinion doctor. In defense of my oncologist - my husband told me he was only rushing because I was insisting on starting as soon as possible, fertility be damned... so, I guess I was not firing on all cylinders in that meeting because that was not how I remembered it! Two breast surgeons and two oncologists agree: chemo first, though. Pathology: ER+ / PR -/ HER2 - /Ki67 proliferation index = 95% He said the ER is weakly positive - only 16%, so he is sending it for more testing - an Oncotype test to drill deeper and find out if it is a true +. Scans: bone scan normal; CT normal. Likely chemo game plan: A/C/T --- some discussion of taking out the A if it is truly ER+, but he's leery of doing so, given how low it is. Tamoxofin/surgery/radiation later on. One step at a time, as far as I'm concerned. Thank you all for helping me through this difficult time.",

I was diagnosed just three weeks after my 33rd birthday with stage 2 triple negative breast cancer. I had no significant family history and my BRCA gene test was negative. I am married, but we had no children, so I underwent \"fertility preservation\" -- I had my eggs harvested and we made embryos which are now stored. If anyone is interested in doing fertility preservation, consider going to the Livestrong website. They give out grants, and quickly, to people who meet the income requirements (which are not terribly low, either). We received a grant and it knocked down the price tag for all of this from a little more than $10k to about $4k. I live in NJ, but went to NYU for a second opinion and once they told me they recommended the exact same treatment proposed by my oncologist in NJ (dose-dense chemo, AC-T, then most likely lumpectomy and radiation), I felt confident staying local. I am extremely lucky to say that my treatment went as smoothly as possible and I got a near pathologically complete response from the chemo, completely clear nodes, and good margins. Knock on wood, I had no long-term effects from the radiation, other than slight \"tanning\" on the area. For those of you just starting out, my heart breaks for you. This is such a crappy turn of events. But, YOU CAN DO THIS. You will be surprised at what you can do. Take things day by day and one thing at a time. Try not to let your mind go to the dark places of fear too often -- it is normal and part of the experience and you have to deal with those feelings, but try not to let them dominate. It might sound ridiculous, but when those thoughts try and pull me in and I truly don't feel like I am \"processing\" anything - just wasting time - I literally say to myself, \"Just don't think about it.\" You are in the midst of a trauma, and you can't expect to understand how it is changing you as it happens. Just do your best every day, and as you move through this experience you will have to be patient with yourself. Sending you all the best. If anyone ever needs any questions answered about fertility, chemo, lumpectomy/sentinel node dissection, or radiation therapy, please feel free to contact me. It would be an honor to help someone who is in the position I was in a year ago.",
