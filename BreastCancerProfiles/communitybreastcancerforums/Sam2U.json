Swimmom-I'd ask the doctor about the sleeve, they should have given you something to watch for the signs of LE, I got something from the PT at the hospital.  There is also a section on this site about LE.

I am so scared that this surgery might kill me, that I haven't really been able to process what this surgery will be like.

Nothing prepared me for all of the emotions either, I have been having a pity party all morning. I never wanted a mastectomy, but the location of the two tumors gave me no choice. My bs didn't want any reconstruction until after other treatment, so it appears to be a concave hole where the boob used to be. I have only looked at the edges of \"what's left\" from the bra, but it just makes me cry, I feel like a monster. I need to get over it and gather my strength for the rest of the journey.

When this journey started, my local small town hospital did the initial testing.  I never felt comfortable, and someone here recommended a NCI Center so I moved my care.  A lot of the tests weren't repeated, but just results reviewed.  At hospital 1 I was told I had multi-centric tumors, one IDC with areas of DCIS, and the other IMC, both tumors under 5 mm.  So early stage. Well the final pathology from the NCI Center is in, the two tumors were actually one large tumor that was incorrectly read on the MRI and incorrectly diagnosed at pathology.  There is no IDC or DCIS, it is all ILC and LCIS.  The tumor was 9.4 cm, 54 lymph nodes were taken, and 2 are positive, so it's Staged at IIIA.   The mo said with my stage the Ocnotype is not suggested nor would it likely be paid for by the insurance, both he and the bs highly suggest chemo, and dh and I concur. Since I still have a drain in and it has to come out first, port placement is Jan 7, and I start dose dense chemo the following week.  Hormone Therapy is planned and radiation will be a possibility. Feeling better two weeks after surgery, almost back to \"normal\" other than the drain, but that is just a necessary part of the process.  Ready to head back to work on Monday.",

I left with appointments next week for checking the drain and seeing the mo, and they are scheduling the appt for the port for chemo. What a rough boat ride we are on!",

I had a MRI over the weekend and went back to the surgeon for the results today. It was not terrible, but not what I was expecting. The cancer is IDC, doctor says less than 2 cm, but with DCIS around it. The enhancing masses seen in the MRI are 3.8(trv) x 3.4(ap) x 3.8(cc) cm in the anterior middle third of the breast. There is also an enhancing mass in the upper inner quadrant, measuring 0.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm. Apparently this area shows in the mammogram, but the larger area doesn't. The radiologist is suggesting a stereotactic biopsy of the second area if I want to conserve breast tissue. If the biopsy is positive, then BC would recommend LT MX. My husband suggests bmx, the BC doesn't think it's a bad idea given all the information, but then there is re-construction to consider. I have no idea what to do. I was planning the lumpectomy of the mass I felt because it was \"small\" but now with two areas!?! Biopsy or no? Oh, the good news? The right side was all clear. My head keeps spinning.

With all of that said I don't regret my decision--the chance at added time with my family is worth it all-I just wish someone had told me what to expect.   Each of us make personal decisions regarding treatment and you need to feel confident in what you decide is right for you.  Options in treatment are difficult, but as you said--at least you have options.",

I always forget the questions or forget the list, unfortunately, there is no one available to go with me that I would want there :). I'm really thinking that they won't know what size, type, etc until we have final pathology--I guess that is common? I have more appointments next Monday, followed by a SNB on Tuesday, then we map out surgery/treatment/reconstruction, but the SNB and genetic testing was info the doctor wanted first. Thanks again!",

My biggest decision that still looms is radiation or not.  I had a unilateral mastectomy with no reconstruction at the time, but with positive nodes, the mo and so are both recommending rads.  I have to wrap my head around radiating the chest wall over my heart and the risks vs. the benefits.  Then there is the vanity thing of wanting some type of reconstruction so I am even again.  I don't even know where to begin to research how to calculate the how radiation will increase your life expectancy if you have a mastectomy?!?  everything I find is on rads after a lumpectomy.  Any suggestions?  Hoping everyone is having a se free week.",

Katie--since the size of my tumor was mis-diagnosed at another hospital--my surgery came first, little did the SO know that the patholoy from hospital A was also wrong--it showed a 3 mm tumor, but actually it was 9.4 cm--so I too will be up for 6 weeks of radiation after a mastectomy, it's VERY disappointing. For the ladies who are having bad joint/muscle pain with Taxol, after my first weekly Taxol, I had horrible ovary pain, joint/bone pain.  I decided to try the Claritin-D 24 hr since it had worked well for the nuelesta shots.  I take the generic form of Claritin-D the day before, the day of and the day after the chemo.  It worked pretty well for treatments 2 & 3, I just had #4 yesterday, but hopefully it will still work.  It didn't totally make 100% of the pain go away, but it was much, much better.  I don't know if it would work for anyone else since we are all different, but I hate for anyone else to have the horrible pain. Edited to add-Carpe--I am still in your pocket with good scan results vibe!!",

In my case it's more of a discomfort thing, as I have long ago given up just wearing a fitted shirt. Everything is layered now, even in the summer. I have tried the bras with the lace across them, but because of the tissue removed during the mastectomy and the fuller shape of my natural breast, the concave area of the mastectomy side starts about 1.5 inches below my collar bone. Most of the lace coverage bras don't come that high. The fitter gave me some of the little pads to fill the gap, but even she said she didn't have a great open to \"fix\" the issue. Even tried the Amoena camisole/bras that work so well for other people. For me they are very comfortable, but I still have to wear a higher neck to camouflage the concave area. So I just stick to the high camisoles, undershirts and such. Modesty4me makes some great high neck camisoles as does Van Huesen. May try Jo-5's suggestion to anchor the bra!",

Even camisoles are too low and I have to find ones with high necks. I am constantly adjusting my professionally fitted bras since they migrate to the side with a boob. No matter what I try the things wont stay put! I have lymphedema so wearing the bras bothers that, but going flat on one side makes people stare, and I HATE that. One day the aggravation will overrule the fear of the reconstruction and I will change it !",

My surgeon's staff was not very supportive of my emotional state and how the need to look \"normal\" affected my overall well being. I had to search out a mastectomy shop on my own and get proper \"equipment.\" I work in construction and if you can imagine the stares and glares from people when you are lopsided. I felt self conscious and didn't like to go out. This site helped me get the courage to seek out proper garments and prosthesis. It helped a lot . I rarely go without a prosthesis of some type now, and I don't feel that anyone knows that I am a uni. It has helped a lot to feel confident and ok with my body as is. I still have challenges with the new way of dressing, and wearing a prosthesis all day can cause the lymphedema to flare, but overall it's better. I don't know that I would call any of this journey positive :lol But it's been really good to know that I am not alone or crazy for wanting to dress a certain way or find the right bra, keep one natural breast, etc, and that's what keeps me coming to this site. It's important to know there is another side to the journey and you can get there. Hope you had a great weekend Sara!!",

Most of the ones I have are made of a t-shirt material, but I did get one from there that is a polyester material. They have a higher neckline that covers my concave area. I still have to wear a bra under them with a prosthesis, but I can put the camisoles under V-necks and such. They are a soft t-shirt material that feels nice on your skin. The Amoena Valetta camisoles are a knit material that come with a built in bra and pocket for a prosthesis(I use with a lightweight foam). They are a great substitute for a bra if you are looking for that type of camisole, but they don't come high enough in the neck to cover my concave area. They also are like a t-shirt but have a higher lycra/stretchy conten(than Modesty4me) so they fit more snugly than the Modesty4me. My problem is that with v-necks, scoop necks and such is when I lean forward you can see to my waist due to the concave area compared to my size c-d cup on the natural side. So I have to wear a high neck to cover that--either a camisole or a shirt with a high neck. It would be great to have a camisole that both has a high neck and a built in bra but no luck yet.  HTH",

Unfortunately, most of the bras & forms I have purchased online have to be returned. Sometimes that's not a problem, but check with the retailer first, because sometimes it is. If you have insurance, they may pay for bras and forms, ask the fitter how they handle payment. Some of the camisoles with built-in shelf bras with a light weight form are great. I don't know your bra size, but as a uni you will have some unique issues. The weight of the natural breast may not match the weight of the form which will allow the bra to move around your chest, with lighter forms and sports bras they may ride up on the form side. You just have to try different forms to see what works for you. After living with on-line stuff for 2 years, I worked up the courage to go to a \"real\" fitting. The difference was amazing, hope you have the same experience!!",

He said that he could see that I had indecision about a umx or bmx, so he wouldn't let me make that decision while facing cancer. He suggested that we divide our plan into 2 parts-treatment and prevention. I needed a umx for treatment now, the other side was prevention and could wait until treatment was over. Again, this was because I was not 100% for the bmx and he wanted me to be more at ease. It was the best decision for me and I hope you have found the best path for you. There is no right or wrong.",
