My SEs haven't been too terrible.  Just an overall feeling of yuck.  I'm at day 10 and have more energy and less nausea.  However, I've noticed that I have a persistent feeling of light pressure at the back of my throat.  I've been blaming it on heart burn or gas, but am now wondering if it is related to the port in some way.  I think I'm thinking about it too much.  Also, my scalp is feeling funny.  I've been washing my hair lightly every three days and haven't noticed much shedding.  The texture has changed though.  My skin is very dry and I have been having little outbreaks of acne.  I skipped church today and am taking a sick day at work tomorrow.  Our students have MLK Day off, but staff is expected in for an in-service.  My boss encouraged me to work at home whenever possible, so I'm going to do just that.

I know how you feel about feeling sorry for your children having a 'sick' mom.  Even though mine are all in college, I still feel it hurts them.  I've decided to make the most of what I'm dealing with and include them in most of my treatment and decisions (to a point).  I am the child of a 'sick' mom.  My mom was dx with bc when I was 18.  She passed when I was 26.  Back then, bc was something no one talked about.  My mom was very private and we (her children) never really new what was going on.  We knew she was sick.  Everyone whispered about her treatment, but no one talked to us about it.  When we asked, we were told not to worry.  Needless to say, we worried and mourned quietly.  How sad.  I don't want that for my own children.  We talk openly about everything bc related.  We even joke about it (I know, poor taste).  Early on I told each one that I would be totally honest with them and answer any question.  I promised to not keep secrets so they should not worry about the unknown. I hope I'm doing the right thing.  We definitely have become more close and loving over the past few months.  I'm not afraid to tell them I love them and we hug a lot more now.  I go out of my way to 'be' there for them and in return they have been there for me.  I guess we can't protect our children from all evil.  However, we can use these trials to become better parents and partners. I just wish it was easier.",

I think the hardest part of working while in treatment, for me, will be letting others take over some of my responsibilities.  We just began our third quarter at school and I insisted on taking back two classes (Yoga & Health) that were removed from my teaching schedule when I went on medical leave for surgery.  My boss was a little annoyed with me since he knows me well.  He only agreed since I promised I would let someone cover on my 'bad' days.  But I feel so guilty.  My coworkers give up prep periods to cover my classes and I know how precious these preps are in our busy day.  They did this for the 6 weeks I was out on leave.  It is so hard to ask for help or accept it when needed.  Unfortunately, I think I will be practicing this skill often during the next 2 months.",

I'm on my feet all day.  Not looking forward to this at all. Our social worker sent me a text on Friday that maybe I should consider working part time.  I'm trying to avoid this at all cost. I used 7 weeks of sick time after my surgery and I don't want to use up the remaining time.  Also, I think after a certain amount of time, my boss can consider filling my position according to the FMLA.   I carry our family insurance.  It is great coverage.  After reading about all the insurance issues, I realized just how lucky I am.  As long as I receive my tx through HUP (my employer), my co-pays are virtually nonexistent.  I guess I'll just have to see how it goes.  Karen - Can I come sit in your car and scream with you?  Then we can pretend to go out for a drink or two! Diane and Kelly - The Art field is so difficult these days, especially in education.  My daughter is in her second year at the Tlyler School of Art (Temple U). We have been trying to encourage her to keep an open mind about her major and to look at job potential before making any big decisions about her major, etc. And I also agree: STUPID CANCER!",

Right after my 4th AC I was hospitalized for 2 days.  I had a high fever,diarrhea (C-diff), and I felt like crap. I must have heard  5 or 6 times from health care professionals 'how good' I looked!. I finally said to a nurse that I really should practice 'looking sick'.  All my life I've put on a strong face and got on with life no matter what was going on.  My mom was like that too.  I don't think it gets you much in the long run. At work my boss is trying to be helpful and understanding.  Twice this week he stuck his head in my office and told me to go home early. That's nice, but it doesn't do me any good since my work load (mostly paper work) is the same.  I can't go home if I have time sensitive reports or IEPs to write.  They can only be written at work where I have access to student files or intranet access.  I know coworkers are trying to help but they have their own lives to deal with etc.  I think most friends feel like its time to move on.  This BC stuff has been going on since September (for me).  Its just too long.  I think we are all tired of being 'sick'. Hopefully your daughter will be given SS disability. This can be a big help to reduce financial concerns, etc. That is certainly something that you don't need to worry about now! And by the way, many report that the 4th AC is not as bad as #3.  Personally, if you take away my little visit to the ER, #4 was manageable.  Taxol has not been too bad so far.",

I run around the house without it, usually bald, so I could imagine forgetting it.  I imagine that I will dump the wig as the weather gets hot.  Peggy, I'm so sorry you are feeling so fatigued.  I found that many of the AC SEs slowly went away.  My eyes are much better and I have no stomach issues.  My skin feels better as well. Even though I am more fatigued and my body aches a bit, I just feel better overall.  Hopefully you will too! I did learn a big lesson - stay away from people who are sick!  One of my students had a terrible cold with a fever a few weeks ago.  She is in two of my classes.  I did not protect myself and ended up with the same cold.  This led to an overnight hospitalization this weekend because I had a high fever and a cough.  Initially, they said I pneumonia which was later debated.  It was difficult to determine which of my complaints were due to taxol and which were caused by the virus.  Because they thought I had pneumonia, I was pumped full of antibiotics. Now I think I might now have thrush. My tongue feels weird.  I'll have to call the mo's office today.",

JoyceNYC - Did you have a C-diff infection?  If so, how was it treated. I was sent home with no treatment other than probiotics.  I had no active symptoms (diarrhea and fever) on discharge day, so they told me to just watch for the return of symptoms. Momof2inME - Do you think you might have thrush?  My mouth feels weird sometime too.  MO said it might be due to thrush.  My mouth gets really dry when I sleep and tongue feels like sandpaper when I get up.  Right now we decided to just let nature balance out the bacteria and fungus.  If it gets worse we treat it.",

Its grey and very soft. I can't imagine wearing my wigs during the summer.  My head sweats up a storm now and it hasn't been very hot yet. We are taking our whole school on a trip this Tuesday.  I can either go canoeing  or go on the walking tour of a famous DuPont estate and gardens. Both choices are problematic.  I don't have the stamina to canoe this year and am not looking forward to walking in the hot sun with a group of teenagers. Fortunately, my coworkers understand. Peggy - I've heard that the grey is followed by darker hair as it grows in.  I sure hope so!  While I had plenty of grey, it was mixed with red/brown as well.  I'm not ready for all grey!

The infusion itself was somewhat anti-climatic. I had a port placed on Wednesday, which worried me.  I thought that it would be too painful to use.  I was pleasantly surprised at how little pain there was when the nurse accessed it. No trouble at all!  The infusion started with two bags - saline and anti nausea meds. Next the Adriamycin was injected (2 large syringes) by the nurse into the iv line.  That took about 15 minutes. The Cytoxan was given as a drip and took about 30 minutes.  I did get that funny feeling in my nose from the Cytoxan.  Not at all bad though. I'm embarrassed to say that I ate a big chicken cutlet sandwich during the infusion.  I guess I wasn't too nervous about the procedure.  However, as the day wore on, I became more tired and had less of an appetite.  By dinner, I had soup.  All in all, not too bad!  I can do this 7 more times! I think I'll head to bed soon.",

So far, I am feeling better than I did on my first infusion.  I ate sensibly before going, sipped ginger ale and ate some cracker while there, and ate a bland but nourishing meal for dinner.  Unlike the first time, I plan to medicate at the first sign of trouble.  Zofran might not be my first choice since it can cause headaches.  I guess I'll see how I feel if/when I need something.  I did buy the ginger gum that was suggested.  Haven't tried it yet.  I hear it tastes terrible.  I'll let you know.......

I didn't realize this was an option.  Has anyone else had this option.",

I am really glad I decided on the port.  The nurse had such a hard time finding a suitable vein to get an iv line started for me today.  I can't imagine going through this each time I have chemo.  Now, as long as I can keep it infection free, I will be happy. Good luck those who are starting or having treatments this week! You are all in my thoughts.",

The nurse began the taxol around 11:30.  Within three minutes I realized that my chest was getting tight and I felt a strange pressure at the base of my throat and upper rib area.  The nurse immediately stopped the drip and called for backup.  Within seconds three other nurses came to the room.  My vitals were taken and I was given more benedryl  My NP from the MO's office was there within minutes. I was monitored for 30 minutes and more steroids were given (hydrocortisone).  The MO covering for my MO came to clear me. The feeling went away and the taxol was tried again. This time I noticed a weird muscle pain in my shoulder.  The taxol was stopped again and I was watched.  The pain did not go away, so it was determined that it was not related to taxol.  Most likely a reaction to the other meds given. Tx was resumed once again.  This time everything was fine and I finished the full dose at 4pm.  Next tx we will start with the higher levels of everything.  I will take 5 steroid pills the night before and five more before my appointment.  More will be given during the infusion. The premeds caused some restless leg syndrome. I was jittery as is from the steroids. Weird day!  But they promise that the SE will be much less trying than the AC SE.  Typically SEs show up 3 - 4 days after tx. .I will be having the neulasta shot after the first 2 txs.  We will see........... Hope everyone has a much more boring taxol tx!",

As far as isolating, I tried to avoid going to crowded places, I wipe down the grocery cart handle when shopping, I carry hand sanitizer and use it, I avoid any sick people, and I wash my hands regularly.  I skip church If I don't feel up to being in a crowded, germy, hot place.  I hope God understands!  Unfortunately, as a teacher, I am in contact with kids who have colds.  I've asked my students not to use my pens and pencils, etc.  So far so good.  We will see.

Friday was taxol tx #3 for me.  One more to go.  I've been very fortunate with this tx.  The SEs haven't been too bad.  Sat was fine, Sun was a day of rest, Mon the fatigue and mild bone pain set in, and today was better.  I made myself go out in the car. I tried to get some errands run since i'm on spring break.  As long as I walked slowly and took short breaks, I was able to get some shopping done.  Of course, I needed to rest when I got home, but that's okay.  I found that if I take an ativan at night, I can sleep pretty well.  My appetite has been really wonky! All of a sudden I like spicy things.  Very weird! I made an appointment to meet with my RO in two weeks.  I met with him in Dec for an initial consult.  Now its time to get the rads scheduled.  I think I'm looking at 33txs. I also have an appointment to meet with the genetic counselors on Friday.  We will look at my family tree and then get some blood drawn.  Meet again in 5 weeks to discuss outcome of the testing. Is anyone making plans for the summer?  The closer I get to finishing this stuff, the more I feel that I can actually plan things again.  Nothing too exciting mind you. But I think I need to have something to look forward to. We usually don't travel much and my 3 kids no longer have any interest in going to the beach as a family. So I'll probably focus on the house.  I like to redecorate during the summer (I have off).  Maybe I'll do something with the family room.  My DD wants to have a big yard sale.  That might get me to clean out the basement. Hope everyone has a good week, with no unmanageable SEs!.",

Bela - good luck with the mastectomy. I understand that mastectomy alone is rather quick and doable.  Are you having both breasts removed or one?  No reconstruction at this time?  Reconstruction can be a pain.  I hated mine for the longest time.  Now I'm glad I did it.  everything is settling down and gravity and time made the 'girls' look so  much better. Jenn - OUCH!!!!!  as Nancy said, how can someone miss a port????  I think I could it myself by now.  What a long day you had!!! Nancy - I know what you mean about the steroids!  Because I had that small reaction during the first tx, I need to double the steroids.  While the benadryl makes me tired I'm feeling the steroids at the same time.  I can't sleep or get comfortable.  I find myself walking around for an hour or so.  My ifussions took at least 3 hours.  I know I won't sleep well tonight.  Fortunately I have a good book to read.",

I got my TLC wig in the mail yesterday.  Its not too bad. Not really the right color, but a nice auburn brown.  I'm more a brown grey red.  This will be my weekend hair, for shopping and going out.  I think I might take a chance on an ebay wig.  It looks cute, close to my color without the grey and going cheap right now.  If no one bids I'll grab it.  I think I will have to limit my work wig to the one I've been wearing.  While most kids know about my hair status, they were a little upset by the change.  So, no experimentation at work. Kblack - Hang in there! I can't imagine have toddlers around now!  You are my hero!  Just keep telling yourself that you are doing this so that you will be around to help them plan their weddings. Believe it or not, time will fly and you will watch them go through all of their major and minor milestones.  I look at mine these days and I thank God that I've had the chance to see them grow, through good and bad events.  My baby will turn 20 on Valentine's Day.  I remember the day she was born!  It seems like just a bit ago. I had tx #3 on Friday and so far not too bad.  I hate the steroid.  I do feel jittery today.  Couldn't finish my scrambled eggs (5) this morning though.  The dog loved them!  She knows to hang around while I eat.  There is always something left for her.  Yogurt tastes good, so I'll eat lots of that.  I need to exercise more I think.  I do feel better if I get out to things.  But then I worry about being exposed to germs.  Purel is my new best friend. Wow, chemo brain is really hitting this time around!  I left a pile of papers on the receptionist desk after my appointment on firday.  She had to track me down in the chemo suite.  I couldn't find words yesterday.  My sentences seemed to trail off and I would forget what I was talking about. Fortunately, I was mostly  talking to my daughter, who has a good sense of humor about this whole business.  I told her i had \"chemo bread\" ?!  She reminded me that it was called chemo brain.  We had a good laugh.  I feel like my 96 yr old dad, who is slowly losing his vocabularly.

They do it on a somewhat regular basis.  At my treatment center (HUP), they seem to encourage a person to try using their veins first.  If that doesn't go as expected, they offer a port for the following infusion date (same day).  According to my RO, other local treatment centers (like FoxChase)  automatically place ports for chemo.  I guess different philosophies.",

I'm being treated at a very large university teaching hospital.  During chemo, my MO's patients all got treated on Fridays.  Therefore, all of the patients I saw where being treated for BC. There was a certain camaraderie and exchange of support and info concerning BC.  The radiation center of the hospital treats all kinds of cancers, pediatric and adult.  Now I'm getting to know people with throat cancers, prostate cancer, rare skin cancers, etc.  I met a woman from Bermuda who had to come to the states in order to receive rads.  There is no facility on the island. Her insurance co is paying for her to stay in a nice one bedroom apartment in Philadelphia while she is treated (5wks).  Sort of a mini vacation with rads! For those of you just beginning rad tx, you might want to buy your own hospital gowns.  I found some on ebay and amazon that were cheap and reasonably well made.  Since you will be changing into a gown everyday for 28 or 33 days, it feels really nice to have your own clean gown on. I have 9 more txs before I'll be finished.  My MO wants me to start the hormone blockers in a week or so.  I'll be meeting with her soon.  I believe I'll be taking Arimidex.  I have a bone density scan scheduled this week.

Annie - YAY for the good pathology report!!!!!  Rads isn't so bad.  It is time consuming and a bit weird, but not at all related to chemo.  At least, that was my experience.  I suggest that you buy yourself a few cheap hospital gowns since you will be doing alot of changing in and out of them (at least 28xs).  I found my own clean gown felt so much better than the ones provided by the treatment center.  I found some on ebay.  Amazon has them too.  Or, I would be happy to send the 3 I have (only used for 2 weeks). PM address if interested.  They are a bit big, one size fits all.",

I do appreciate every one's concerns, but I don't know if I want them.  I feel like a sick person. I had my 4th and final AC tx yesterday.  I was seen by the NP before tx.  We had a nice talk about how I was feeling.  I described my overall feeling as though my entire body is upset with me.  She said is was pretty upset with what is going on and that it should be upset.  AC is poison and very difficult to tolerate.  I felt a little better.  She also reminded me that the effects could be cumulative.  So next weeks should be loads of fun!",

It was very reassuring when my MO suggested it be removed.  She felt pretty confident that I won't be needing it any time soon.  As a stage 3 person, that sounded good to me!  I was pleasantly surprised to be given the option to have it removed under local anethesia (lidocane).  A few needle sticks around the original scar and I felt nothing.  The catheter was removed without trouble and the port followed with just a little cutting of tissue surrounding it.  I was in and done within an hour with no recovery time.  Of course they offered conscious sedation but that would have required an IV and recovery time afterwards. So far, no SEs from arimidex.  That is good.",

The neulasta shot  is a relatively new and very expensive drug that stimulates your bone marrow to produce blood cells.  Since chemo destroys these cells, the neulasta helps you body build more rapidly.  Some people experience bone pain, particularly the larger marrow containing bones - upper legs, sternum, hips.  Apparently claritin helps relieve this pain.  I don't know, I didn't take any claritin.  I did not have noticeable pain.  Some MO's don't prescribe with the first tx.  I guess they want to see how well you do?  Most people have thier cancer center give them the shot.  Mine isn't open on Saturdays so we do it at home.  It really isn't difficult.  My husband (no medical training what so ever) watched a youtube video, read the instruction in the packaging, and gave me the shot.  Almost painless. As for other medications - wow!  They gave you nothing else?  I came home with 3 anti-neausia meds, steroids to take for three days, emend for two days, and 1 pain med (Oxy) for the neulasta shot.  They also gave me a list of over the counter type meds that might help.  I also had a prescription called into my pharmacy for an antiviral med when it looked like a fever blister was going to break out. ",

My MO is targeting very specific areas - lymph nodes under arm and along neck and chest wall under left breast (where it used to be).  He might be able to reach some nodes near sternum.  He said that they won't reach any  nodes under sternum if it means getting too close to heart and lungs.  I was a little concerned about the nodes located towards the sternum since one of my biobsies showed ILC toward the inside of my breasts. He said that I should wait at least 3 weeks from last chemo to give my body time to heal.  However, the simulation can be done anytime after chemo.  My simulation was 6 days after my last chemo.  My first actual tx will be just under 4 weeks since chemo. Denise - I found my RO to be quite different from my MO.  My MO is such a compassionate and warm person.  She is just wonderful!  My RO, on the other hand,  is a very interesting brainiac who can talk for hours about radiology and statistics.  He is not huggable in the least, yet he seems genuinely concerned about my prognosis.   There doesn't appear to be a pompus bone in his body.  I really like him as well as trust him.  Very different individuals!  My daughter thinks I'm pretty cool since I now have four tattoos.  However, with my freckles I'm not sure anyone will be able to find them when they need them. Well, one week out from my last chemo tx and i'm starting to feel excited.  My SEs last week were stronger than previous txs and I really couldn't celebrate the end of chemo.  This weekend I feel good and its starting to be real - no more chemo!!!!!!!  I'm willing my hair to start growing, but not seeing any progress yet.  However, I am starting to feel stubble in certain areas (not my scalp unfortunately).I know that it is going to take time.  My poor old follicles need to repair and grow hair.  My eyebrows are almost gone and I've been without lashes for a week or so.  Very strange looking. I hear they come back fairly quickly.  I hope so.  The fatigue is the worse though.  I can barely walk up a flight of stairs.  I have some neuropathy in my toes and finger tips that seems to be going away (I hope).  MY RO said I might feel more fatigue as a result of the rads. Oh well.",

This has been quite a journey!  I didn't get a party either.  However, I did get big hugs and well wishes from the nurses on duty that day(twice from MO's NP).  The radiation center gives a t-shirt and has a person ring a large bell in the waiting room when finished treatment.  Everyone claps and congratulates the patient.  Last night an older gentleman finished treatment and gave a little speech about courage and fighting cancer to the strangers in the room after he rang the bell.  He has been battling cancer for 25 years and he encouraged everyone to fight as hard as they are able.  It was very emotional.  But then again, everything seems very emotional to me these days. I can bring on the tears at the drop of a hat! I am receiving treatment at the University of Pa medical center.  The radiation department is quite large and the waiting room is for people receiving traditional linac radiation as well as proton therapy.  I've noticed that there seems to be a a lot of men being treated for throat cancer. Last night a group of these men were talking while waiting for their turn.  Every one of them smoked for many years.  Seeing these men made the connection between smoking and cancer so real.  I wish I could get this message out to the kids that I teach.  They are so oblivious, as I guess most of us were at their age. I start my third week of rads this evening.  Time is flying by and summer is right around the corner.  Fortunately, rads has not been bad.  No real SEs so far.  Its time consuming but doable.  I'm about 5 weeks past my last chemo tx and am feeling pretty good except for some lingering neuropathy in my feet.  That could take months to resolve.  My hair is slowly returning and I have the beginnings of eyelashes.

DD decided to live at home and commute to college this year.  My once empty nest is now full.  I'm not sure if I like it.  I was looking forward to some peace and quiet and some quality time with my DH.  Once again, our attention is focused on the daily lives of our children. It sounds like you are enjoying your grandchildren.  That is a real positive and a good distraction I would imagine. The older ones might be able to help around the house.  That would be nice! The upcoming trip sounds like a good distraction as well.  LA should be nice in December. ",

As someone mentioned above, I found that work kept me sane and less focused on the negative aspects of this disease. It gave me a reason to get up every morning. I did take 6 weeks off to recover from BMX with immediate DIEP reconstruction. That was unavoidable. I also took off every chemo day (8 Fridays). I felt well enough to return to work on the Mondays following chemo. I work in a small private special education school, so I felt I needed to share my diagnoses with my coworkers because we are really close. My boss was very understanding having gone through this with his mother. He encouraged me to go home early when my classes were done and he always checked on how I was feeling. My coworkers were also very understanding and did not expect me to take on any extra responsibilities. I had the luxury of not having young children at home, so I could collapse once I got home from work. Many of my students knew that I was dealing with a health issue, so they became sensitive to how I was feeling and behaved accordingly. Some even told me later that I inspired them to work harder even though they might not be feeling 100%. I must admit that I really felt physically and mentally well enough to continue working. If I didn't, I would not have worked. It is a personal decision that must be decided based on what the individual needs and can handle.",

Both could be controlled by me (to a degree).  Once home, any pain was controlled by Tylenol or oxycodone.  I think I only used the oxycodone once or twice in order to get comfortable to sleep.  The drains were not that difficult to take care of.  I came home with 4 and cared for them myself.  There were a few issues with the reconstruction early on that made me question my choice.  My abdominal incision reopened in one place and took forever to heal.  I was out of work for 6 weeks.  I had one drain for 5 weeks post-op. My one flap (foob) had a section that was healing slowly so I needed to dress it daily. And I had a lot of swelling.  However, once everything cleared up, I love my new foobs. They feel and look real without nipples. By the way, my sister was diagnosed with DCIS 6 years ago.  She opted for a lumpectomy with rads and 5 years of tamoxifen. She had a hysterectomy this year due to uterine changes brought on by the tamoxifen.  She was also tested for the BRAC1 and BRAC2 genes and came up negative.  I am waiting for the results of the BART genetic test.  My mom passed away 30 years ago from bc.  It is such a tough decision that only you can make.  You will have to weigh all the pros and cons and decide based on your needs and wants.",

Students are sent to us by their local school districts who pay the tuition. The program is highly individualized and students are given a great deal of support and encouragement.  We have a social worker and psychologist on staff.  We have an art and music program that is very therapeutic. The benefit of attending an actual school as opposed to cyber school is that the students get to interact socially, they have access to live teachers, they receive a variety of educational materials,they get out of the house, and the day is structured for them.  We also offer guidance and support to the family. We've found that some students need to get an advocate to help negotiate the school districts evaluation process.  Some parents need to sue the district for services.  There are law firms that specialize in education law.  Also, there are many support groups that can help parents navigate the education system.  You might want to look into this organization http://www.nami.org/ Good luck!",

For me, it was a no-brainer since I'm employed by Penn. My care was almost costless as long as I saw Penn doctors. It was also a fairly easy commute by car, train or bus. I also liked the convenience of having all of my doctors under one roof. My BS knew my PS, RO, MO, and GP well. I was even able to get my tattoos at the PS office from a woman who does areola tattooing, as well as other cosmetic procedures, at the office a few days a week.

No hair problems!  I'd grab the wig and run out the door. By July, I had enough hair to put away the wig.  The hair that grew in is so new and soft.  I have a little more grey than I did before, so I'm thinking about some color to cover the grey. Just keep in mind that it is just hair and that it will grow back.  Don't spend too much on a wig and experiment with different scarves and hats.  Get a few different wigs to match your mood.  It might actually be fun.  Early in my tx, I was in the wig store looking at scarves.  A young couple came in to look at wigs.  I couldn't help but think it was such a shame that this young woman was going to loose her beautiful long hair.  To my surprise, she took off her beautiful long 'hair' to try on a short wig.  They were headed to the islands for the weekend and she wanted a short wig to wear while there.  We got to talking and she said that she was in the middle of tx and was making the best of it by enjoying life and living it up.  Good for her! ",

I'm from Media also!  I bought two wigs from Lovely You as well as a number of scarves and a nightcap.  I had a work wig and a sassy weekend wig. I found the owner to be very understanding and helpful!  She was fitting a client on my first visit.  The women who was trying on wigs noticed my lost look and invited me into the fitting area to see how she looked wearing her choices.  That really calmed me down and I was ready to shop.  My daughter (20yr) was very helpful.  We actually had some fun trying on different looks. You might want to ask your MO for a prescription for a cranial prosthesis (wig).  You insurance co might cover the cost.  Also ACS offers free wigs.  I have a large head so none of the free wigs fit me.  Some people go online to buy wigs.  The TLC catalog has very nice synthetic wigs too. Some people try to keep their hair by using cold caps.  However, I was not interested in going that route.  It is expensive and very time consuming.  You need to have someone (preferably two) with you to time and change the caps.  You have to buy and schlep dry ice to each infusion.  My tx time was used to rest and read.  The results are not guaranteed and you have to baby your hair for months afterwards.  Even with this care some loose all or a good portion of their hair.  I found my wig to be very convincing!  No one knew I was undergoing treatment unless I told them.  The wig is easy to care for and always looked fresh and clean.  I didn't have to fuss with my hair in the morning and actually slept a little latter since it was one less thing to do before going to work.  I teach high school, including a low skill yoga class.  My wig held up throughout tx and I got so many compliments on my 'hair style' I'm trying to grow my new hair to that length now.  Good luck!  If you need any more info about ACT and/or wigs just drop me a line.  I am being treated at HUP and am two years out.

Another item that came in handy was a cheap 'picker upper'.  Sorry, I don't know the real name. I found  that I had a difficult time bending over to pick up things the first few weeks.  This really helped. I bought a cheap shower chair, but found I only needed it for the first week.  I was a little shaky during my first few showers, so the chair allowed me to sit and take my time. And finally, we bought a comfortable recliner right before surgery.  I've slept in it ever since!  I hate sleeping on my back - but ps will not let me sleep any other way for the first 4 weeks.  The recliner (with strategically placed pillows) was very comfortable. Good luck, take your time recovering, and remember that every one's experience is different. Don't be discouraged if your recovery is not as rapid as someone else's.  My ps has to keep reminding me that it really takes 6 - 8 weeks to begin to feel normal (whatever that is). Janet",

And finally, I'm pretty independent.  I didn't want to depend on anyone else during treatment.  I took a train to my medical center on treatment day; saw my MO; got my blood work done; had a cup of coffee; and began treatment by myself.  This was my time to meditate quietly as the chemo was doing its job.  My husband would work a half day and join me at lunch.  He would bring snacks or treats and stay while I finished.  We would leave together.  No one ever knew I was a cancer patient unless I told them.  My wigs were not very expensive and they looked very real.  I had a work wig and a weekend wig that was a little more sassy.  My daughter helped me pick that one.   My hair grew back in better condition than it was.  I'm three years out and my hair is longer than it was before chemo. I have no regrets and would do it again if necessary (God forbid).  ",

I found that it was very important to take whatever meds I was given.  I learned my lesson early on by trying to limit the anti-nausea meds.  Big mistake.  I found that if I treated every symptom as it appeared, right away, I had manageable SEs.  I also learned how to say NO.  If I had no extra energy, I didn't take on any extra jobs.  I exercised when I could, and napped when I needed to.  I asked for help when I needed it, which was very hard to do. Fortunately, I found rads to be very easy to handle.  I scheduled my sessions for after work and informed my husband that I would not be making dinner for the duration.  I took my time driving home, knowing that I could go straight to bed if I wanted when I got home. Hopefully, you will be one of the lucky ones who can manage both tx and work.  If not, then you need to take care of yourself and reduce your workload.  It is for a limited amount of time; hopefully your employer will understand.",
