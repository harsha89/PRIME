I've been doing some reading on the possibility of skipping chemo after surgery and it appears the mammaprint may be the best test out there to determine necessity. Apparently it is for tumors less than 5cm, her2 + or - , no more than 3 nodes involved, and stage 0 or 1. It appears to be more effective than the oncotype dx, which can be more ambiguous. From what I've read, for some women the rate of recurrence or mets does not decrease with chemo. Now, having said that, I just started reading about this a few hours ago, so I may be mistaken or I'll informed about the whole thing, thus I'm here asking for input. Does anyone know about these tests? If the mammaprint is as good as it sounds, I think I'd like to have it. Thank you in advance.

My ROsurprised me by telling me he'd just read an article on how MD Anderson has had success with the Canadian method (16 treatments) even after receiving chemo and he immediately thought of me. I met all other criteria (lumpectomy, small tumor, no node involvement and over 50), but because I've done chemo I wasn't going to be eligible. Well now I am eligible! I wish I'd asked for details on the article he read. I googled a bit, but couldn't find anything. Has anyone else heard about this? It means I'm getting another step closer to putting this ordeal behind me (I still get herceptin every third week for the rest of the year), but my jaded mind is now worrying. I appreciate any information anyone can offer. I'll call his office if I have to, but thought I'd try here first.
