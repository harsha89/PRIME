      "Content": "pattybelle wrote: I am 45, went for regular mammogram on April 24. On April 28, I received a letter telling me I had an abnormality and needed to call for more testing. Got in the next day (thank you, God), for more digital views and ultrasound. Radiologist found an abnormal mass, Bi-rads 4, and advised me to consult with my doctor. Got into surgeon on May 4, he first suggested needle biopsy while working to pull up my digital mammogram and ultrasound. After viewing both, came back and said we had two options. First, lumpectomy. Second, watch aggressively and wait. I told him to take it OUT. So, I'm scheduled for wire loc, excisional biopsy on Tuesday, May 19. I'm scared, and I feel guilty, because I had noticed that my left breast had grown considerably larger than the left. I had written it off to perimenopausal changes, and the fact that I had began a pretty agressive excercise program this year. (Thought I was simply over-developing left pecs). My sister and two children (19 and 22) are coming into town for the procedure and I don't know how to deal with keeping them calm. ...not to mention myself calm. I'm having outrageous anxiety. Any thoughts? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "pattybelle wrote: Went for second opinion in Salt Lake City yesterday with an excellent breast surgeon who is affiliated with the Huntsman Cancer Institute. He checked out all my mammos (Birads 4) and ultrasound, did a physical exam, and then did a core needle biopsy. He was so reassuring, said it didn't \"feel\" like cancer, but he wanted to get the pathology done to be sure. He said if there was anything atypical at all on the pathology, he would do an excisional biopsy. I felt so relieved after seeing him, like I was finally in really competent hands. I'm so glad my ob/gyn referred me to him. I'm a little sore today, but really it is minor. He said we should have results tomorrow and asked me to call him first thing (so much nicer than...we will call you...). The 220 mile drive was so worth every minute. Peace to all awaiting resul.ts, and may your doctors be as awesome as Dr. Noyes. Patty Log in to post a reply",
