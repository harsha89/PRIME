The worst part about it is that scratching it doesn't help! The whole area is numb and the itching feels like it is coming from inside the breast - help this is agony!!!! Is it the nerves reconnecting or could it be phantom itch (which is worse as no telling how long that will go on for). Will anti-itching creams or medication help? I have to find some solution I can't carry on having this everyday of my life it is the most irritating thing ever to have a scratch you can't itch!!!! Help!!!!! Log in to post a reply",

I guess if feeling can be regained on the surface you would think that scratching an itch would cause it to go away but then again it depends how deep the itch is lol! Is there anything that can be done then about phantom itch as I guess creams, pills etc will not have any effect?",

It is such a maddening feeling not being able to get to an itch! Another thing I wondered is do we ever regain feeling in the reconstructed breast and if so how long does it take for it to come back?",

Had checked with surgeon first who was more than happy as he said there was no reason why not as no scar under breast or anything.
