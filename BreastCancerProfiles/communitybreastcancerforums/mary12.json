    "Content": "mary12 wrote: Hello, I have been having a pinchy sort of pain under my armpit going into the side of my left breast for the last month. I notice it at various times of the day, regardless of activity and when I'm not palpating it. It's a strange feeling; it doesn't seem muscular but when I press on it there is pain. When I pick up the tissues with my fingers and squeeze them, I don't feel the pain. It seems like it is in the layers of tissue above the muscle. There is no single defined stationary lump that I can find, more just a fluffy sort of array of soft masses. Palpation feels similar on the right breast (but with no pain), except it feels extra fluffy on the left. I have very small breasts. I'm wondering if mammograms get in the armpit, or if there's a different kind of test I should have (if I should have one). I'm 40 and my mom had breast cancer when she was about 53. Thank you.
