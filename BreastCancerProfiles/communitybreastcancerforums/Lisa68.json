It may just take some time for them to settle it. Good Luck! Lisa",

They tape the wire down so it really isn't that noticable or uncomfortable.  Most likely you will ck in to the day surgery a hour or two before your scheduled surgery... a book would be a good plan.  Good Luck!

      "Content": "Mar 5, 2009 08:35PM - edited Mar 11, 2009 08:14PM by Lisa68 I had my first baseline mammogram at age 35. Had my first annual mammo at 40. I was recalled because there had been a change.  The next mammo confirmed microcalcifications and I had stereotactic biopsy that same day (2/3/09) and ADH was found.  On 2/26/09 I had a Breast MRI w/ die contrast.  The results were no suspicious findings.  On 3/3/09 I had a excisional biopsy and I am extremely thankful to say I do have ADH but the biopsy revealed only fibrocystic changes. I will have follow-up mammograms every 6 months and see my Onc surgeon after Mammos.  I believe I will continue annually to have the MRI.  My surgeon offered me Tamoxifen... but I don't feel that I am ready for that yet.  Five years ago at the age of 58 my mother had DCIS stage 0.  However, the only followup recomended after her excisional biopsy was mammo every 6 months.  We have requested my moms pathology reports because she was never given a copy.  This will be an important key for both of us.
