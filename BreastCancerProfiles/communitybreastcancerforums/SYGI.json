I am given the option of doing just one side mastectomy with immediate reconstruction (expanders) , then have the prophylactic mastectomy at a later date. The other option is to do everything at once(Bilateral mastectomies and implants). Based on your experience and recovery, would you advise having it all done at once, or do one side at the time. I have 3 small kids, and also have my family support and help.",
