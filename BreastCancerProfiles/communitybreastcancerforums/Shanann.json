      "Content": "Jul 30, 2015 07:50AM - edited Jul 30, 2015 07:59AM by Shanann I decided to do the 12 weeks of Taxol, instead of the DD every two weeks X 4. I questioned my Oncologist about many things! He explained to me that people with a higher stage cancer are the ones who usually take the 12 week regime although both are equally effective, and that it is a matter of weighing which SE's I'd rather deal with. The DD would cause way more fatigue and nausea, which I want to avoid at all costs as I'm heading into my busiest season at my job. Believe it or not, the DD has less issue with the neuropathy, which was scaring hell out of me, but the nurse explained to me that I should report any and all issues as we go, so that they would know, if needed, when to stop treatment before if became irreversible. DONE! One other thing is that I don't have to drive to the hospital the next day for that nuelasta (sp) shot. So, I have to go 4 extra weeks, but the hospital is only 24 miles away, and I can better deal with having a POSSIBLE one 24 hour down time verses 4-7 days. I asked him how long it would take to recover when the treatments are over. He reminded me that I had to get through radiation, then there was the pill, but that I had get my 'game on' to deal with the second phase of treatment. Having said that, he said that it would take as long to recover as it took to take the treatment, so my treatment was a 5 month regime, and I would recover as slowly as I went down, but would gradually start feeling better just as I gradually started feeling bad. In other words, I would be feeling much better in about 5 months, and my hair would start coming in about 3 months after treatments ended. I asked him for his OPINION on why so many women are getting cancer, and he explained that one reason the statics are so high is because 'we' are catching things much earlier now, but he also felt that it is environmental. Perhaps in the chemicals in our foods, and the products we put on our bodies, etc... I am definitely trying to read those food labels. It would be much cheaper to pay a few extra bucks for, say organic fruits, and chicken that is not pumped with chemicals NOW than pay for chemo or other medications later. I'm trying to eat more greens, like kale, spinach, avocados, and trying to cut down on grains (grass fed butter and meats), and cut down on sugar. I love wine, and Merlot is dry. I asked him how he would know if I were still cancer free when the treatments were over, and he explained that they would continue, each 6 months for, I forget- 2 years- to check through my blood work, and would be able to see how my liver, heart, and other organs were functioning, as well as checking my lymph nodes. So, that's a nice safety net for a few years. I also asked about taking some supplements to help build up my system against the SE's, and he explained to me that I could take Vitamin D-3 in 5,000 I.U. daily dosage. This is something we ladies with cancer are usually greatly lacking. Got some- CHECK. He also said I could take a B- Complex, but not to worry about taking supper high dosages, because our body only absorbs 100-200, and anything over that we just pee out of our system, so paying more is a rip off. Got some- We are just not supposed to take excessive amounts of antioxidants while taking treatments. You guys are probably already aware of these things, but I wanted to share for anyone who MIGHT have these same questions. While I was taking my 4th DD treatment of AC, another elderly lady was sitting beside me getting her FIRST treatment. The nurses were upset and whispering because she did not have a port, and THEY called HER doctor while she was there. Of course, they were concerned about collapsing veins, and the harshness of taking chemo this way. An appointment was scheduled by the nurses for this lady to see her doctor about getting a port before her next treatment. The lady asked me about it when I was leaving, and I explained to her that she would be much better off to get a port placement, and it would not hurt. When I went in yesterday, there she was, and all upset, because rather than get a port she opted to get a catheter in her arm, and now the dang thing had slid down a bit so the nurses could not test it by drawing blood (to make sure they were in), and that had her worried some more. I am glad I don't have HER Oncologist. God has been good to me in directing me to the right doctors and surgeons. That Poor lady. Please, say a prayer for her. I haven't heard much for anyone. I enjoy reading what each of you has to say and your doing on your journey. In other words, I miss you!! You are in my heart and thoughts, and in my prayers. -Shan",

I'm at the halfway mark, and leaning toward continuing with the dose dense regime as my Oncologist thinks I'm healthy and we should get it done. I'm just dreading 4 more high dose treatments.",
