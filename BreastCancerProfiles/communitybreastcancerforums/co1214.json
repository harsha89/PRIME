My pathology report showed one 6mm margin (other three sides were > 10mm) so the margins were more than adequate, and the diagnosis was still DCIS and no invasion or node involvement. A few weeks later, I went in for the radiation planning, simulation, markings and tattooing, but I kept having second thoughts. I realized that my main goal was to have the lowest possible risk of recurrence - with high grade DCIS and my margin size, a study I found said that risk would still be 25% with radiation, but a mastectomy would put it at 2% or less. Also, if I had radiation and then ended up with a recurrence, I couldn't have radiation again, plus reconstruction is more difficult after radiation. I was to start radiation on a Monday, and on the Thursday prior to that, I called my surgeon and said I thought I wanted to change direction. I went to his office that afternoon and told him that I was losing sleep over my choice and felt I really wanted a mastectomy instead. I met with the plastic surgeon the following week, and had the mastectomy two weeks later with an expander placed. That was about 7 weeks ago and I just had my sixth \"fill\" yesterday. Although, I've had a little discomfort, it's not been nearly as bad as I had imagined. If things stay on schedule, I'll have the expander exchange towards the middle or end of November.",
