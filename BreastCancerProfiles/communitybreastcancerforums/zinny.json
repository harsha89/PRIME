      "Content": "Dec 8, 2015 06:00PM - edited Dec 8, 2015 06:02PM by zinny Hi folks - dropping in from the fall group on my last day of rads - I have had bilateral lumpectomies and had right sided radiation to axillary, cervical and thoracic lymph nodes, as well as right breast. Wanted to show you how things look for me at the end of treatment. The picture is a little forgiving, in real life, it is a little more red ( especially after a hot flash or a good laugh or a moment of child induced frustration). Wishing you all well!  Oh, btw, My shoulder looks lightly sunburned as well.  \"Wooohooo. Done rads!! Bit anticlimactic, really. I have been lucky to have the skin sparing approach as I still have a BMX and recon to go, and other than a bit of itch, my skin is holding up well. My last three treatments were boosts, so the most irritated bits are now 5 days since treatment, and if things max out at day 10, I hope things will be ok. Hope this is helpful to the newbies, to see some of the milder outcomes.\" ",

So, I have a question for those still following who are done - I have now had 17/28 rads and I only have the tiniest bit of itchiness on my upper back. I am really hoping to go skiing just before Christmas, and was trying to book a trip. The first day would be 9 days after my rads are done. Am I crazy? Can I guess that if my skin is good so far, I should be ok. I do have a high pain tolerance and pretty tough skin. I ran 10k the other day, and my energy is still good - appreciate your thoughts.  Also, re the nausea - I was super nauseated at the 14 treatment mark. I got into a pattern of nausea, not eating, more nausea - also taking letrozole, could have been that, also metformin, could be that too, and calcium et. Once I made sure I ate regularly and was more aggressive with drinking water, it has been much much better.",

Creative Vintage, I was exhausted for a day 2 weeks in, and realized I was not drinking enough - water, that is;) Make sure to stay really hydrated. Also, I wasn't interested in eating, and I think got behind on my food. Starting my morning with a third of a can of Rumble seemed to help. And, counterintuitively, do a little exercise that gets your blood pumping - seems to help me, anyhow. Anxiety and worry. I, too, get down if I come on here too much. It's a catch-22 of support and anxiety induction. When I am getting more tense, I visit less and meditate and walk more. A very good friend, good enough that she could say this, said to me \"You are not dying.\" It might be harsh, but if you stop and think about it, and really examine your fears, it helps. It sure helped me. Because ultimately, that is our fear, isn't it, that it either we can't get rid of it, or it will come back, and we will die from this. But, we are not dying now, we are nowhere close to dying, we are a very long way from that. What we are doing is living. So, live your best life right now. Save worrying about the scarier stuff for when it is time, which is likely to be a very long time away from now. It also helped me be less irritable with my kids, because if what I fear most is my/their loss, it puts a new perspective on how upset to get about those dirty socks/uncleared dishes/cranky responses. That's it for my deep thoughts today. Hugs to all. ",

Creative Vintage, lots of people don't have the bad side effects in the pictures - I am just back from #8 of 28, and honestly, I question if the machine is even working because there is no difference at all between the sides. That being said, I am doing the tissue sparing longer cycle so that I heal better when I have my mastectomy/recon, so they are being gentle with me, and predict my s/e to show upon another week, but they are expected to be mild. The actual rad treatment is like getting a fancy Xray with a bit of noise like an MRI machine - mine treats three lymph node areas and the whole breast and takes 5 minutes. I read all of this stuff and got all stressed and spent a bunch of money buying creams on Amazon\u2026and then when I went for my sim, they gave me very specific instructions to use only water based unscented creams like the Aveeno one, to avoid anything with petrolatum, and that there was no evidence that Aloe made any difference\u2026so, I suggest not worrying/preparing too much in advance! Itchers ( thankfully no one's name!) Benadryl is only one of many antihistamines. It is the quickest acting, which is why people chose it first, but causes way more sleepiness than all of the new \"2nd/3rd generation\" ones. Ask your doctor/pharmacist/NP for the non drowsy alternatives - some are OTC and some are prescription - some people have mentioned Atarax ( prescription) which is usually very effective, there are a bunch of others like Reactine which work, too.",

The got more blocks of tissue ( in addition to the 152 slides already done) and saw more stuff, I guess. Our team said that year ago, they would have given chemo for ILC but that now the feeling was there was no added benefit with micromets, and so we went for aggressive hormones and radiation. I was very \"for\" chemo and they would have given it if I had asked, but the oncotype quoted worse outcomes with chemo, which sold me. So, doing things a little backwards.
