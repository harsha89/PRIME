I have a problem with my husband understanding what I am going through because he had a stroke 7 years ago and his emotions just aren't there.  He does go to my appointments but not sure if he realizes how serious the situation is.  He doesn't hug me or show physical emotion and sometimes I just need a hug. I am praying I don't need another surgery but the waiting is the hardest.  I take care of everything at home.",
