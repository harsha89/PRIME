I just posted in another forum that I want a mastectomy and have my ovaries removed. I don't what this stuff ever to resurface. We are here to support one another. I have not told my father anything due to loosing my mother to gall bladder / liver cancer in 2013 and he is still grieving. I don't want to put anymore pressure on him with him being in another state. I will keep you in my thoughts :)",
