That was ruled out at the ST my heart is very healthy. So the breast pain persisted and the became a little pink like a light sunburn...on one side. The random nipple discharge of clear liquid scared me because I am not able to have any more kids and its been over 5 yrs since my last one.  So I finally decided work could wait on me for a change and went to my Gyn last week, had thyroid, cbc, and hormone tests, along with tests on the nipple fluid. Was sent for mammogram and ultrasound this week.  All tests results were good or negative for infection. Mammogram and ultrasound showed nothing of concern...in fact my bi rad was 0 which is great...but the radiologist came to the ultrasound sound room and told me everything looks great and wanted to see my breast. She examined just like the doc and my lymph nodes under my arm and collarbone. Which are painful..she told the nurse to contact my doctor and get a script for an MRI. I asked her why do I need an MRi she said just to rule everything out.She said that if they find inflammation or infection they will do a cote biopsy..that was yesterday. This morning first thing when the Dr office opens they call me to let me know that they have the results and sent the script yo the radiologist. This afternoon the radiologist calls to tell me that I'm scheduled for next Thursday first thing.  I have never had Dr react so quickly and I'm a liitle worried...has anyone else had this happen so fast.
