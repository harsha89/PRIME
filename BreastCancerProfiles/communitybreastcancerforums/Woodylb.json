As i decorated that year and prepared all for the festivities , my husband and I had tears in our eyes . So this is my fifth Christmas since my first and the third since stage IV. I want to wish all of you lovely ladies an early Merry Christmas , hoping that each and every one of us will post here every Christmas for a very long time. Remebering all those who left us here on BCO who marked our lives with their kindness and courage. Santa throws up every year in my house no matter what !!! :))) ",

      "Content": "May 18, 2015 03:10PM - edited May 18, 2015 03:59PM by Woodylb penny i just read a beautiful story, a oung women lying in bed sick and her sister next to her. She was watching from the window a tree whose leaves are falling. She asks her sister how many leaves are left n the tree , and the sister replied few why are you asking my darling? And the sick sister replies because i will die when the last leaf fall. And each day a leaf fell from the tree and they young women kept asking hownmany leaves are left , thinking that with the last one she will die. Until one day there was only one leaf left. But the young women was making the best of her time left with her sister. Still everyday she kept looking at the tree and the leaf was still there , then she started to get better and finally she healed. She went out to check what is the story about this one leaf on the tree. Only to find that the leaf was a plastic one which her sister planted there. Life becomes hard but it does not stop, we may lose hope but hope does not die, because the king of life is alive among us. Xoxoxoxoxoxoxo",

      "Content": "Feb 9, 2015 08:47PM - edited Feb 9, 2015 08:49PM by Woodylb  To Raro 's daughter, Thank you so much for the update as i was really worried about her the last time we sent private messages to each other was around the end of the first week of January. But i promised her i will keep messaging to her even if she cannot answer. I am so sorry she is not well and keep praying for her every night so that she is comfortable and peaceful. My heart goes out for you and her. But i can uunderstand why the bed scares her. I myself sleep only few hours at night. Bed reminds us of death and dying and it is scary to most people. And i know how tiring it get for you to help get up or lie down. My aunt has lung cancer and she has diffuclty breathing and she was given Zeldiar which is derived from morphine, it kept her rested you may want to check this with a palliative doctor, it may suit her. It will not make her sleep for more than 3/4 hours but it will keep her calm and half sadiated. Again thank you so much for updating us and know that we are all praying. Please if you need anything feel free to private message me anytime. God be with you and her. Love and prayers.",

Artist , ew days back was admitted to the hospital for a clot in the lung , went back home . Again at home she did not feel well nor was she able to eat. She was back at the hospital the next day for hydration and food. This was the last message i received from her. I believe if she was back , she would have posted here and send me a message. I hope she is well and we all will hear from her soon. Someone asked abour affinitor (everlominus). There was a thread here posted by Romansma, may she rests in peace. If you check her name you may find the topic , as she was on affinitor for 9 months. However, I agree with Z , i do not think affinitor is a successful treatment for Al resistant patients or breast cancer as a whole. Of course this is just an opinion. Ann/kaption as JFL mentionned i dida CISH test through Carris since FISH failed twice to prove my her2 positivity. taxol, herceptin,perjeta wwere my life savers , i got 2 years of total remission. Now i am on tdm1 (kadcyla) but my onc told if i get progression again , she will go again for taxol, herceptin, perjeta. So to all of you ladies who are turning her2+ i wish you all the luck and an excellent response. Warm regards to all ",

My advise to you is to be informed about liver mets , but do not go much into it or you would get lost and it will depress you. It is true that finding out you habe MBC is bad enough and having a progression to another organ is notconsidered good news. There is nothing in stage IV reassuring but people survive somehow. Visceral mets are worse than others. But again there is no some people live with and do better than others and others don't. My advise to you is to stay focused , take care of yourself , do not let the cancer take over your life and get a good oncologist , one you like and trust. I hope you find peace of mind and inner peace. :)",

When was it that you got Taxol? And had a complete response. This is for my own info since i have ILC too. Is your liver still clear? I responded to chemo only at my first dx along with femara for three years. The two chemo i got after my liver dx didn't do much for me. It is known for ILC not be very responsive to chemo , the percentage is low. However, taxoteres are according to the test i did chemo from whoch i could benefit. So now i am wndering if i responded to taxol ot H/P. my doc thinks it is most likely HER2 but he did say we will have to wait and see. My test is caller molecular Intelligence testing . It was made by Caris life sciences obviously their main office is in Arizona , but mine was performed in Gemrany here is the address: 4610 South 44 Place, suite 100 / Phoenix , AZ 85040 /(888) 979-8669/ fax (866)479-4925/ / CLIA 03D1019490/ Zoran Galactica, M.D.Dsc, Medical Director Caris MPI, Inc,d/b/a Caris Life Sciences This is not covered by any insurance and the cost in Germany was 6500$ While CISH is approved it is still not a standard test while the other tests are still investigational. But i went for it anyway because i know alot of onc are using it in extreme cases. Good luck. I hope this helps and i do hope the foundation performs such tests.",

On carboplatin gradually. Now on taxol which is a taxotere it went gradually but till now i still have some of it , it has mainly thinned a lot but not lost totally. I do not know if it has to do with fact that i am getting herceptin/perjeta along with it. I know it is a good feeling to lose your hair uear in and year out. But if it works on the cancer then it is worth it. I am so sorry for your bad luck this past week and the worst of them is the TM rising. The rest well you know there are always days in a year where you feel everything goes wrong at the same time. I think it is a cycle in one's life. We all were in the same situation one time or another. It sure does not help when your health is at stake but try not to let it effect your state of mind. For you to go yet through another treatment will take its tall on you and you need to preserve energy and a strong state of mind. I hope things will look up from now on and you get into a routine in which you can manage your time and your life. I want to wish you a smooth sail for the chemo, hoping it will bring your TMs down and kill the beast. If you are having a blood test, i assume you will be soon starting. With God's speed and a healing touch. ",

I am happy for your good news, as for the liver well, it is harder for it to get stable. At least they got the biopsy right which will allow you to do some further testing which could help in the way to manage your disease. I had a genomic testing done and it helped me greatly since my FISH showed negativity for HER2 but ky genomic testing showed extreme positivity. Thanks be to God i am now NED with no evidence of disease. I pray God you get to this status too and. Hope for all of us we continue to do well. I am asymptomatic too even though my liver had around 15 tumor. So have faith and i hope soon you will get all god news.",

However, a second opinion is always welcome and you go with what feels right for you. Being triple negative sometimes has its benefits. It responds very well to chemo , it has been 8 years since your last diagnosis , this is also in your favor, and my onc told me IDC triple neg may more than other go on remission. So why not believe you may be one of those. I have a friend who is triple negative her first diagnosis was 24 years ago and she was advanced and had only chemo and radiation. She was 33 at the time and the cancer was very agressive. It never came back. So i hope all works in your favor. Abraxane is a good chemo and it may shrink your tumors or even make them disappear. As for not knowing what comes next and living always in fear , it is hard , i know but somehow eventually it gets easier even with the ups and downs. There are some ladies who have been living with satge IV for years. Treatments may never stops bit it becomes part of your life and if you look at it from a positive angle , that we are luckier than the ladies who had the same diagnosis years ago and who did not have the options we have now, well you feel blessed. I know there are no positive sides to cancer but people get sick and die from dofferent reasons , there are no guaranties even when we are healthy that we won't die from something else. I know you know all this but fear is crippling and it makes our thoughts fuzzy. You may beat this again and survive for many years to come and i wish you this from the bottom of my heart. I take it one day at a time , i live as normal as i can and do my chores , while i am alive and healthy , i want to enjoy what i have without letting the stupid cancer make me forget that i am alive dispite it.",

They are rough chemo but work well on reducing tumors. I have had Gemzar and carboplatin it was very tough on my blood and platelet but not on the tumor . It reduced it by 20% and they had to stop it after 6 cycles because it became toxic for my blood. After three month on AI my tumors doubled.suggest weekly taxol or any taxotere.

I want to wish you good healing on this combo, lots of prayers , and faith. I had the same combo upon my reoccurence, it is a fairly acceptable combo as far as nausea and ill feeling is concerned. But please be aware carboplatin is rough on the blood, both red and white blood cells as well as gemzar . Also the blood platelets are badly hit. Even though your nurse vonlonteered the info of iron. My onc told me the anemia has nothning to do with iron deficiency ,mit is strictly the side effect of carbo. Eating iron rich food in not bad , but the combo disrupts our bowels enough without adding the iron lollll. What i advise to do is to know your own body . If after the second cycle extreme fatigue kicks in then call your onc immdediatelt and run a blodd test . Also you have to be careful not to bump ypurself fall or cause any hematoma on your body and of you do , you watch if in half an hour it becomes doblue the size you do not call you rush to the hopsoital . Another symptom of low platelets i itchin very badly then you may see red spot where you itched looking like pins and needles also you rush to the hostpial. This heppend to me starting after the second cycle continuing on to the third and so forth. I had to have a blood tranfusion, neupogrpen and cancel a dose and the last two cycles i got them on reduced dose. You do not lose all your hair not from gemzar but carbo. I got 20% rediction on the main tumor , amd small ones bcamce nearly visible and lower activity..so i switched to examestane which falied me after three months and i got s progression. All this sais hehehehe not to scare it really is not bad and if your blood is strong you may not be so hardly hit. But if you get hit do not painc there is awlays a soluton. I hope it gets some reductiob and stable. Stable is not bad he is nice guybut his cousin NED lollll ot a much educated guy. I hope you get a long visit from eother of them .

It is called SUV The higher the SUV is the more it is likely your tumors are prgressing. PET is not very accurate in size but 99% accurate in detectting metastatic activities throughout the body. CT cannot. In stage IV PET. Is used to be able to follow the patient more closely along with the mets. I have been having those since december 2014 every three months. So i guess this will be your baseline. Sometimes the lesions show but when there is no activity on them it will mean your cancer is there but not active. Try to keep yourself busy until you get the results. I pray you have an encouraging one. Enjoy your time with your sister. Hugs.",

My onc told me before we started carbo/gemzar that the maximum he can keep me on this combo is 8 cycles. I barely made it through six. The last two cycels where reduced. As they damaged my blood and my platelets greatly. After this my onc decided not to do the extra 2 as he said it may be irreversible. So be careful for signs of extreme fatigue, tiredness also blue spots lik needles on the skin caused by low platelets even if i scratch. Well it is time i do not wosh to remember. I was scanned after three months of the treatment and they new from the results how much the effect will be. So after six it was discontinued. I hope it is working for you and that it dicreased your tumors greatly but evenif it is so, you cannot continue in it forever. He / she have to have a second plan for you in case you responded to keep you stable and if God forbids you did not to start you on a new one. Please forgive me if i sound strange on carbo/gemzar i do not mean to be patronizing , i just heard the same thing from three different other oncs and other ladies.

These combos are most golden for cancer but halas they react differently on each and everyone of us, this keeps pharmaceutical searching for different cures. Thank God each one of us found her own golden combo. So i will be doing a lot of happy dances for each everyone on this board. :)",

I do not know what your doctor told you when you started this tx, but mine told me it will be tough and he also told the maximum amounts of rounds is 8 not more.

Your numbers are intimidating , true, but it does not mean this treatment will not work for you. One week is very short to tell if it is working or not, it may even raise your numbers a little more. This happens sometimes when you start a new treatment. But if it is working it will bring back down. So have faith and a little patience and give it time to work. I know you are axious and scared but it is the only way to tell if a treamtent is working is to wait at least three months , during which you will be monitored and your doctors can tell if they should stop or continue. I, like you run towards praying, prayers are very helpful and give us hope. So i will add my prayers to yours and wish you good response .

When markers and tests go up during treatments , like it did on affinitor , it would be mainly because the treatment has failed. When people are NED it is usually after six months it the tumors come back during this period then it would not be NED. You did not mention what type of cancer you have, is it IDC or ILC? Maybe you should request a new biopsy to see if your cancer have mutated and this will help more in defining your treatment. Unfortunately, in cancer there is no trend in treatment, it does not work this way. Each person is different in response and it depends on your type of cancer and subtype, grade, location and a lot of other issues. It is up to your doctor to decide what would be best suited for you and your needs. Ibrance is the latest meds used for ER+ patients. I truly wish you a good response to it. ",

Mine is flushed every 21 days when i get my infusion. i noticed for the last few times after each infusion it stays kind of blue for few days. It was not like that before. I guess the meds which are infused are kind of harsh on veins on the long run. I don't know the name if mine but it is the second one and it is very good and it was installed at the same place where the old one was. So it is the same vein. I sure would not want a new location yakkkk! One location is more than enough. You are right to hate the way it looks, this one is ok though , it grew on me so i wear what i like :))",

Faslodex is a good choice and is know to work well on ILC. I believe she will recommend Chemo if there is a big progression God forbids. But i am glad you feel more at ease, don't let go of the hope yet. It maybe a simple inflamation like she said. Two scans back i felt the same as you bloated and reflux and all the usual symptoms , when i did my scan there was nothing wrong. It turned out to be lyrica which i was taking for neuropathy. Femara causes all kind of SEs , if i remember correctly when i was on it , most of the time i was on nexium, ibrance may cause this also. From what i understood from the ladies when on ibrance they got high liver enzymes. Some cancer meds are good for cancer but not good for the liver. I hope this is simply your case.

I started herceptin, perjeta with taxola year and a half ago. The taxol was stopped after six months. During this time i was being checked for heart ejection every 2 months. About 8 months ago my ejection went down to 40 . I was given concor cor and ramipiril and i skipped one dose of herceptin perjeta. It went back to 55. Then we did other tests which showed my heart reserves are healthy. 2 months ago the same happened , i did not skip my doze but my heart doctor increased the dose of ramipiril. Now next week i will have another echocardiogram, if it is low i will skip the next dose. What i want to tell you , you may not have to stop it for a long time. As long as your heart reserves are good it is always reversible. If your marker is a little up but still whithin the norm do not worry. Sometimes it differs in labs by few points.

It is an ongoing daily struggle , sometimes things seem to be normal and other times it does not.

But in or order to check them and get more or less accurate results, you have to have a baseline. Tumor markers should be checked at the beginning of a dx before treatemt starts then the doctor will know if they are reliable or not. If you do not have a baseline than you would have nothing to compare it too. With some people it is a very good indicator with others not so much. I check mine but i do not rely on it completely, while with other sisters here and friends it is very accurate. The breast cancer marker is CA15-3 and in some liver mets cases they check CA27-28 . Ca125 is for uterine cancer. So it s a choice whether t have it done or not. Depending also on the onc if she/he believe in it or not. It depends on each indiviual cancer if it produces this particular protein or not. ",

Cancer is very diversified we actually don't why each cancer behaves differently. I personally never had a false positive or negative on a scan or PET scan. My tumor markers are not very reliable , check them but do not count much on them. BCD and marijuana are not available medicinally in my country and never had to use nausea meds . It was given to me on different occasions but never had nausea. So i did not use them. Quality of life is very important in stage IV cancer , i believe it helps us fight this thing and live longer. Also a good spirit and you seem to have both. I hope you will continue to give us good news telling usthe disease has retracted. Welcome again and sorry you are here.",

They are all admirable and fighters. Markers are not really very accurate but in some treatments they are required. So do not count so much on them , count on your scans and your doctors. Mine was progressing without any sign in the marker it was probably the lowest 23.5. Pablociclib seems to be giving good results in clinical trials , h hope with all my heart it works for you. As for the weight most of the time it comes from the meds but also you can make it worse by eating unhealthy foods. I am not very keen on special diets for cancer but i am watching what i eat and how often. I eat a lot of cooked veggies ¬†and add lemons salt and olive oil as dressing small pieces of meat from time to time, grilled fish , fruits and a lot of soups. I do not eat lots of bread , some pasta and some rice and potatoes mostly boiled with water. It worked for me this time around. I hope i helped. Wishing you good health.¬† Hugs,¬† Woody P.S .

We have the same cancer mine started stage IIIb and lasted three years before moving to stage four. However, my lymph nodes status was very high. When i was diagnosed with stage IV it came back the same but the pr changed and they were not sure about the her2 so they sent over seas for a fish test and it came back negative as before. At some point one of my onc wished it was positive he told me it will give him more options. I have liver mets 10 of them and the bone mets is still not confirmed. He started me on carboplatin and gemzar , i still have 2 sessions. I seem to be responding after three sessions, the big tumor shrunk by 8% the small ones ate still the same but less prominent, no new lesions. As it appears for him this is a good response as it appears if i respond after the end of the treatmen by 25% it will mean he stopped the progression , he will move to aromasin. But for you don't worry about how many meds you failed, you still have good options there is still tykerb and others and anti hormones agents like femara, aromasin . So please don't let this get to you no matter how frustrating it is. I pray your scan results come back with a good response and it stays that way. Keep your faith and your strength , after all you did survive 10 years and you will another 10 years god's willing. Big hugs. Let us know your scan results.¬†",

I sure hope that your scans on the 13th come put with regression or stable but not progression. I will pray for you tonight. I am not sure about markers you know? Mine was the lowest when i doscovered my liver mets and till now it is low so my doctor is no longer depending on it. Are your liver enzymes normal? Or are they also climbing up? In all cases there a lot of other chemo which may work.¬† I don't know if you have seen this post it is a lady called kathlyn rich , her cancer became resistant to anti hormone therapy her oncologist insisted that she tries a very old anti hormone med and it is called CYTADREN and she did and she has been NED ever since. Would you please ask about this? Also keep you spirits up i know it isnhard when your body is tired. Since i have started my combo i also felt a lot of fatigue and i got one blood transfusion, and this week my session was delayed for three days , thank god o recovered enough to get it tomorrow but in reduced dose. Hopefully this will be with another one of gemzar my last chemo, after it i will get a scan and a PET scan. So I don't know eother what tomorrow hides.¬† I really hope your scans will be clear and that hour numbers go back again and i will pray woth all my heart for you. Keep me informed also write anytime you like and private message if you want. I just want to tell you that you are thought of everyday. Be well and keep your hope. It is coincidence maybe , but if all is well and i start my anti hormone on the 13th of may i will be travelling to Prortugal in Europe with my husband to visit the virgin of Fatima where she made miracles there , be sure that you will be in my prayers.¬†",

I have to add also that even when a drug passes the three phase trial and it is approved for general the general public it will still be called a trial drug since it will be used for a longer period on a patient , and it may show other side effects, this way they can improve it.¬†",

I am sorry your insurance is refusing to pay , they are idiots, they could actually save in treatment if they get a better diagnosis. Your MO should give them an imperstive reason to accept. Since it is neither growing nor shrinking, it is not bad. Try not yo worry a lot about it. Stable is good in our case. Since mine came also stable. Go figure...¬†",

I also i understand your concern about the course of treatment. But your oncologist is right. If you were dxd with stage I,II, or III, then the treatment will be in the intent to cure, and they hit it with full force, because it will be only for one time, followed by maintenance meds. But once the diagnosis is stage four , treatments are long and different and it would depend on your cancer activity so they try to spare your body as much as they can while stabilizing the cancer, otherwise your body gets very tired and your quality of life declines. I know it is a very hard news to take but keep in mind that the treatments are more advanced and better targeted than before. After the initial shock, things will get better and sometimes worse but it becomes a part of your life and we all live with and be happy to be alive. Keep your strength, and a good spirit this will help. You will find here a lot of support whether it is emotional or educational. Everyone here is wonderful and extremely supportive. I hope very soon you will get to a stable state and like leftfootforward i hope your ups and much higher than your downs.¬† Hugs ¬†",

Until now i believe that they still treat ILC as IDC , i don't believe they did enough research on it. The norm for ILC is that it is indolent , slow and all these nice words but the truth is even though ILC has a low mititotic rate it does not mean it is not harmful because it makes it less sensitive to chemotherapy and supposedly more responsive to hormonal , well the latter is not true either, i got almost three years on femara , and nothing on aromasin except a huge progression. I don't believe they give anything with A/A ¬†because because on its own it is already tough on the SEs. In a sense i would call you \"lucky?\" Because your ILC turned her2+ but i am no longer really sure of anything. What i am sure of is that they really don't know much about our disease its pattern and the way it spreads. Still i am thankful, some of us are benefiting from different therapies and are getting to live longer . I hope your blood work turns out to be an SE from kadcyla and nothing more. Keep us posted.

Your story about facebook made me laugh becuase i do not even bother to explain to anyone anymore what is wrong with me because it does not fall through anyone's head. This time around i didn't even tell my mom , because i sensed she cannot phantoms the truth , it is too hard for her, so we decided my sister and my two brothers and I not to tell her anything. I just toled her i am changing meds, she does not understand cancer for her canceris a death sentence and all she dies is pray the wbole time , she just turned 77 . For my aunt, cousins and famiy members i do not bother to explain anything. On the other hand who told you you would go for two years only? You may be in remission fir a while , you will not be cured maybe so but the stupid cancer can go to sleep for a while longer :))) and i hope this for all of us. Now about the good part of my world lolllll , we live near the red sea and it is beautiful , it is very rich in corals , and fish. We have all kind of seafood, shrimps, lobsters, crabs, octopus, and all kind of delicious fish :p and it is cheap lolll. Next time i will eat on your behalf just tell me what kind you like !!!

My first scan after taxol/herceptin / perjeta back in Jan showed all tumors gone and no cancer activiy. Second one was 2 days ago, no evidence of cancer. Only a sceloritic iliac lesion which i had before my cancer and again no activity. Next tuesday will be my last taxol. I had 6months of weekly taxol but i am a bit worried to stop it. I will continue on H/P of course and an anti hormonal maybe tamoxifen. Hope you keep the good news . Hugs",

It is very scary to find out you are stage four with liver mets specially at such a young age. But do not dispair. Some people live with stage four for years and a lot of new treatments are available. You will meet many ladies here who have been stage IV for a long while. I am not telling you it is a joy ride but nevertheless it is doable. Once you are stable you can have a good quality of life . It has its ups and down, but the important thing is not to let the disease take over . Surround your self with family and friends and people who give you support and not people who do not understand. Keep your faith strong and your will to live stronger. You are young and even though treatments are sometimes hard being young is an advantage. You can come here whenever you feel like venting or just want to connect nd you will find how wonderful and supportive these ladies are. I pray your treatment goes well and works on your mets wonders. I took femara for three years and it was ok and the side effects were tolerable. Good luck to you and prayers that soon you will get to a good place in which you feel comfortable .",

Your case is similar to mine . I am also ILC and HER2+ upon my reoccurrence. Some people do refuse treatments yes, but after a long battle. I did have a lot of digestive problem before my liver diagnosis and it disappeeared after treatment. The sense of fulness does comes from liver mets and the inability to eat. I had an extreme case of acid before i was diagnosed and irregular stools also and was loosing weight. My liver mets were too many with one larger . Frankly i do not think size matters. I am sure your onc knows better than me, but to me what you are feeling are related to your mets. Even though your liver enzymes are still normal. But i want to tell you and ask of you kindly to reconsider before you refuse treatment. When my cancer changed to HER2+ i was offered herceptin/perjeta/taxol. After three months i was clean and i am still clean since a year , thanks be to God. I hope you and your onc reach a decision and i hope it is the right one for you. Stopping or refusing a treatment is a very individual decision. If you respond to treatment you may be able to buy more time. Stopping the treatment will entail treating the symptoms and letting nature takes it course and this also depends on your type of cancer and how fast it is spreading. Time is not the essence in this case as it depends on each individual and no one can predict any turn of events not even your doctors. I hope you take your time and make the right decision for you. I pray and wish you health and long life. ",

No one is ever the reason why this stupid disease keeps popping all over us. So please d not add guilt to the stress of alleged progression. It is good that you will be able to talk with your onc soon and maybe convince her to see you. Here i can see mine whenever i want, it is not restricted and frankly , i think she should see you and listen to what you have to say and also check on your new symptoms. A/A is a good option if prigression is confirmed and her liver guy is also another one. Aromasin was not good for me in controlling the disease and the SEs were terrible. Have you taken faslodex? Since you responded very well to taxol another chemo maybe a good option , like abraxane. I hope you are able to talk about all this with your doctor. Thank you for your kind words , my symptoms are very mild , i will not be pessimistic lolll until i have my scan then we will see. If i have a progression, then another i will require another liver biopsy to make sure i am still her2+ because i am sure they would suggest kadcyla( tdm1). But cancer mutates. I will know next week. Meanwhile, i hope you soon find the answers you seek and feel better and get back on track. Be kind to yourself.",

We have to work around it and do the best we can aslong as we are alive.

Sometimes people tend to forget that we are fighting everyday for our loves, just because we look healthy. I think it is ok to tell someone you trust and you like of your fear and of your disease. You should not be worried about how they feel but about how you feel. You have been through a lot this year and ot is within your right to vent about it. Where did they see a 1cm ? Keep us informed about the MRI . Meanwhile, do not lose hope or give up until you know what is and how to deal with it. You know that many of us on this board are dealing woth different mets and yet still alove and kicking. I am not saying it is easy but it is doable.

But please remember each person reacts differently , s side effects may vary fron one person to another. For me it was ok until the last few cycles. I got tired and put on a lot of weight. But my doctor from the begining told me not to worry about the weight , that i will lose it once the treatment is over. He preferred weight gain rather than loss. Keep you strength, and rest when needed. Good luck to you.",

Even though MBC is a devastating disease and terminal , there are also a lot of stories and hope , and there are people living more or less normal lives and longer lives. It is definitely a deadly and un curable disease but with new treatments it is sometimes manageable and controllable. But so are all cancers. Please check other threads like stage IV forum people with multiple mets , these ladies were dxd stage I and ¬†II yet it came back with vengeance to either stage IV or metastatic.

I simply requested the slides from the hospital where i made them plus all my records , they were given to me and i used them in two dofferent places , one in my country and the other was sent to germany. Usually they are well kept . It is your property not the hospital and it is whithin your right to request them. Of course i am not in the US so i am not sure about the rules. However i am sure of one thing they are your property. Listen also to Stephanie what she posts is usually correct. I hope you get a good advise from SK and that your next combo is successful.

I hope you feel better soon and this incident does not happen ever again. Good news about your mets being stable and very sorry you are progressing again. Your onc is right to request another biopsy to check the status. I requested the genetic testing not my onc, i informed him i wanted to do it . I had read about it and seen it here , so when my cancer reoccurred it showed + 2 on the HER2+ front which was equivocal. The FISH came back. Negative. Later i decided to perform the test through the American hospital in my country and was told they will send it to Germany but they will have to perform anpther histological test again before sending it and they did , it showed +3 for HER2 they did another FISH it also came back negative. I was really losing hope when the results came back ( three weeks later) with a CISH and genetic testing results. Which stated extreme positivity to HER2+ and that they must start me on anti Her2 meds. The test performed by the research lab was called genomic testing. My MO called it intelligent genomic testing. It also showed all the genes and what chemo and treatmebts are likely to work for me backed up with scientific research and their level of credibility. Thanks be to God i got full response on the regimen. The test is not standard and is not covered by the insurance and the cost was 6500$. But it was worth every penny , it bought me more time. The headquarters of the Lab is in Arizona. If you like i could forwatd it to you. I hope you will get a new break with the biopsy. My prayers are with you . Let me know if you need more info. Hugs.",

However, I , like RonnieKay never experienced any pain except a little when i started my last combo and it was minimal and no change in Enzymes. I am sorry i cannot offer this much help here. If i remember correctly your mom had also have cirrhosis , i don't know if this could be the reason that the liver is enlarged with high enzymes. But the fact that her billirubin is not high is good, it means that the liver may be over worked but not damaged, at least this this what i know. An ultrasound is a good idea to see what is going on and how the treatment is going. I hope the pain is a signal that the treatment is working . Still inforn her onc for the pain , for some pain meds to make her feel better. Prayers for you and her and hope verything will be sorted out soon.",

I was on neupogen on the second day after each session. So WBC were always ok , however i was not so lucky with RBC they plunged big time and caused me fatigue and shortness of breath and sleeplessness. I had one transfusion since the plunge is not an ordinary anemia, it is not caused for lack of food it is the side effect of carbo. My onc advised immediate transfusion. I am very happy for Isy and you that his combo is working on your cancer and your tolerance for it is good. I was not so lucky , it barely shrank my tumors and it did a big number on my blood so much that the last two doses were reduced and skipped one. I will continue parying it will keep working for the both of you with the minimum damage. Hourrayyyy for both of you ! I hope it keeps working for a long while and abolishes your tumors.",

I hope you all find comfort and support in our group who is a wonderful one filled with care , compassion and wonderful advice. I just want to give you hope with good news of my own. Today i had my CT/PET scan results are still NED . i would have passed 1 year and 5 months of NED and pray and hope for more. Keep in mind with this disease everything is possible, it is not easy but doable to have a good quality of life . Even when you are TNBC still NED is possible and i wish it for you all. Leftfoot, very good questions and list Mattiefang and Maryk , people react differently to cancer news , give them some time to assimilate the news and to learn how to deal and live with and become supportive. Sometimes you will have people around you act like there is nothing wrong with you and it will infuriate you and others will think this is the end and depress you. Speak your mind kindly, because they simply don't get it. Wishing you all the best results and hopefully NED . Loads of love to all of you",

About chemo brain, please do not worry , we all have it. Taxotere cause me speech problems , carboplatine also , the rest neuropathy and the forgetfulness is normal . Now perjeta is causing a lot of neuropathy , if you notice in my psots alot of mistakes my fingers are stiff and they do not always hit the right key lollll. I am much older than you but my memory was my strength , well not now. But i practice a lot of memory games to keep it working and i am doing better but the chemo brain , well it is better but not totally gone. I use a game called peak it has a lot of brain activities exercises , mental agility, focus, memory, emotions , language and it works. I hope you lovely new ladies will be around for alongtime to support others",

Nothing turned out wrong , even though every time i thought it was back . My onc did not disregard my symptoms either but all looked normal and was seen normal. I have only fatty liver infiltrations but no lesions or activities are seen. But i understand how all these symptoms make you nervous and worry you. Hopefully they are only what they are, SEs from cancer and meds also. My colon has never been the same since the first cancer treatment and the bloating sometimes is part of it, as well as reflux and a tiny pain on the upper abdomen but it comes and goes. I feel it specially after my herceptin /perjeta. I hope you soon put your mind at ease by knowning what it is. But i would not worry much specially that your Tms are ok and other tests. Hugs.",

Yes prigression could make you feel fuller quicker and it could give some pain also. But pain sometimes cones from chemo also when it is killing the cells but only for few days after administration. But do not freak out or think about death, carbo/gemzar shrunk my tumors only by 20% after six months. Then i was on aromasin for three months and i progressed like crazy my liver mets doubled more than 15 and i had spots all over the bones. Six mnths later all disappered. So please do not freak out , you need to think clearly and make sure your MO Is taking all measures to insure you are getting the best treatment. There are still options and good ones. Just don't go to that dark place again and think it is all over. It is not, one of these meds will work for you. Ask for a CT/PET scan as a basline before starting your new treatment. Hugs.",

Fatty food are not good in general less if your liver is effected , artichokes are excellent to cleanse the liver and quite tasty. Just buy fresh artichokes put them in water for a while so the leaves open and you can clean them well , once cleaned put them in a pot and boil them until cooked to your taste and in a seperate bowl crush a clove of garlic with salt add lemon and olive oil , then take the artichoke and peel the leaf dip in the sauce and eat the meaty bottom until you get to the heart clean the heart and eat also. It is quite tasty. Also when you wake up in the morning and before you open your mouth drink a medium size bottle of water, it cleanse everything in your body . I hope this helped.¬†",

I know how frightening and stressful is the unknown. But, i am sorry to tell you about how important it is to biopsy the liver. Without it there is no way you can get a treatment. The liver of all organs cannot be left untreated, i know how scary is the word \"biopsy\" specially when it is in a sensitive organ. It is done by a specialized radiologist because it has to be a CT guided biopsy. It is not painful, and after one day you feel as good as new. I am sorry to tell you that biopsy cannot spread your cancer more than the breast reconstruction can. If your biopsy ,God forbids is positive, then your cancer is already circulating in the blood through the liver. They have to perform a biopsy in order to specify the kind of cancer if it is the same or it has changed so they can treat you properly. I am like you ILC with metastases to the liver numerous , and i do not have any symptoms and my CA 32 , and i look very healthy. This being said , it does not mean your biopsy would be positive, it could benign¬† tumors. Until you get your answer, please go ahead with the biopsy and choose someone you are comfortable with, but do not delay. I will not tell you not to be worried, but i will tell you to breathe slowly and make an effort to be positive. We are all here for support, and i wish you negative results. My prayers are with you, keep us posted.¬†",

It sounds like so much fun shuvelling and preparing for after the snow , here all i could do is watch endless date trees and sand oh ! And a beautiful sea. I love my doctor here he is very protective of me lolll he even called the hospital thieves as this combo will cost my insurance a lot. Just first cycle about 25,000$ but they approved it. We will see what happens next. I am still so thankful and happy for you. Love and prayers are always heading your way. Xoxox",

You have not mentioned if you are IDC or ILC and you hormonal status but i presume you are at least ER+ and HER2 - . The fact that you have intensive bone mets is not as worrisome as having the liver and the lungs . They are most important because they are vital organs. I was on Aromasin last summer and it failed me too. After you had taken other anti hormonal Aromasin alone does not do much. Eribulin is halaven. I have not taken it personally even though it has been suggested to me. But i know few who had taken it on this board. To some it worked while to others it didn't. But in the studies it has shown to increase the progression freebperiod by a median of 4.5 months. As for the side effects well it is a chemo and to some extent they all have the same SEs nausea, vomiting, and low blood cell count etc...but i suggest if you feel this is not working for you and if you still are highly ER+ to ask your doctors about Aromasin +affinitor as they seem to be working together even with in some cases a lot of undesired SEs but they are working. Affinitor works well with Aromasin by stimulating and doubling the effect of aromasin for people who have been before on anti hormone . People are getting stable or shrinking of tumors for quite sometime. Do not be scared, i know it is easier said than done , everyone is scared every time there is a progression because one wonders if this is the end or not. No one can tell not even your doctors as they are wrong also sometimes. Some people they are told you have 6 months or so much time and they go on living for years. Just trust your guts and fill your self with faith that you will do what is supposed to be done to feel better. It is very important that you do not lose hope. I am sure a combination would be the right one for you. Talk to your treating doctor about your fears and worries and let him explain. As for here you can come anytime you like to vent, talk , and say anything you feel like saying. As you will find out soon , there are some amazing women on this thread and this board. They are full of hope , life and energy to last a life time, as wellas compassion, care and giving hearts. My prayers are with you .",

So what i want to say even though it is not our favorite diagnosis but you will find there a re a lot of options , plenty of new medication som will work fine other won't but you will be ok god's willing. It is your right to be scared and cry but ince you start treatment ou will feel safer and stronger to face this disease. Did you get these chemo before your liver met diagnosisor after? It is not quite clear ...if you are highly hormone positive then femara should do a good job in keeping the disease. Stable or shrinking it. I wish you good luck and good health . Feel free to pop anytime here, to vent or to ask any question you like and you will find plenty of nice wonderful ladies ready for help and support.",

Hourrayyy! However , i would advise you from knowledge to keep your diet low on fiber , since fiber tends to empty your intestin they also take away the good flora which makes the intestins a bit tighter to push out the dirt. Try to find yougurt with probiotics and if you eat one a day it will add the good flora while keeping your intestins healthy. Dieticians, and doctors do not always speak the same language and most often do not agree. While on chemo stick to what your doctor says not your dietician. Of course this is only my advise the rest is up to you. But congrat on your stable status and i hope soon you will annouce shrinking. Happy holidays.",

Praying your tumors will keep shrinking . My whole second cycle continued without major problems a slight a neutropenia which did not need me going to ER . I was supposed to have my first PET for this combo this last Friday but it was cancelled the last minute due to logistics in getting the nuclear injection . So i will have it in one month after i finish my 4th cycle . Keep us posted on your new regimen. RonnieKay, i missed you my friend but i am sure you had a grand time with your grandchildren, and i am so happy you are getting ready to leave to CA i hope the trip will boost you back to full energy and i hope you will have a wonderful time. Hydeskate, i am sorry you have to go through all this because of past treatment , and the worst is that they make us sign for this before each chemo. Unfortunately for us if we want to be treated we do not have much of a choice. I pray your new treatment will help your auto immune disease and i pray for you for a better quality of life. The good thing is you are still NED and i hope you continue to stay NED my prayers are with you. Dear Penny, how are you feeling after your first SIR-SPHERE session? And when is your next? I am happy you have a good team who seem to be on top of things. My prayers are always with you. Leah_S any news from your doctor? To all of you wonderful ladies a year filled with renewed hope, an abundance of of joy, and hopefully a cure !",

It is a CT guided biopsy, he will choose the easiest and the least dangerous to biopsy and guided by the scan he insets a gun like needle and take a sample from your liver. For me it took like 30 min and i went home for three days i did not wash the biopsy site , there was a slight discomfort but no pain. How come they didn't biopsy from before? My doctor told me yesterday the latest european studies on cancer it shows that most cancersare mutating, normal testing is not showing the gene mutation, so we get treated as if it is the. Primary cancer . The fact is , it is the same type but with a twist which could save your life. Good luck on your biopsy .

As you will see there are many of us here and we are all eager to help in any way we can. Of course we are in no way a replacement for doctors but we can share experiences and knowledge and give each other courage and hope. I conquer with Penny you have to be your own advocate , and if there is something you are not pleased about , then you make sure you tell it to your onc and make sure he answers. Second opinion is another option . Sharon not all people are able to have a surgery on any other intervention with liver mets. Each body is different and each cancer is different you will habe to ask a specialist so he can tell you if you are candidate to any of the procedure Penny mentionned. At stage IV you are always on some kind of treatment. It is not a curable stage ( only 1% are cured) but it is a manageable stage now woth new medication coming up every few months and we are lucky there are so many options. Allyme , i would ask my onc if there was any regression and how much taxol/herceptin/perjeta is a good combination and is giving good if not excellent results though the scan should be done between the third and fourth cycle of herceptin/perjeta and taxol and you have to leave at least one week between cycles to have the scan so you can get accurate results. After three months on this combo my liver and spinal mets disapeared there was no indication of any activity on the PET. now in april i wll have my second PET and see what is there. Then my onc will decide a course of action according to the results. I pray you have the same results soon God's willing. Both Sharon and Ally tell your doctors of any discomfort you have and insist on a solution specially you Sharon he has to find you aneffective med for vomitting as you need a good nutrition. I , along with my onc i have a family doctor whom my onc reffers me too when it is something he cannot handle . Usually he goves all meds related to side effects but she helps me manage them. To both of you i wish good results and it is a long way and hard at times but very doable have faith, patience and be sure you are physically and emotionally fit enough to endure it. My orayers are woth the both of you. Keep us posted",

Having liver mets from the begining is sure not a nice diagnosis. But your onc had no right to tell you what is the median survival before at least the first therapy. While it is true in stage four surgery on the primary cancer is obsolete because it is already outside your breast it does not mean you are condamned. The therapy you are gettting now is the new first line therapy for her2 + cancers and people are getting excellent results on it. The results will show after your third cycle and will continue after that. Actually, there are some studies which show that people who are stage IV from the start do better than those with reoccurent disease. I also like Penny find it odd that no one will see you until you finish your treatment. Even though this treatment if it works for you will continue minus the chemo. There is a lady here who was diagnosed with liver mets from the begining 13 years ago and she is still alive and kicking. So 15 months is really too generalized it is median true but if this one is successful you will get 56.5 months and i do not advise to think ahead of this much as each cancer is different and respond differently . Who knows your may go into remission for a long time . There is no way of telling or knowing. Wait first to see how well you will do on this one and take it step by step. Already after few weeks you are not feeling the lump this isgood news right? So focus on that right now the rest will come later. Statistics are done as a guidlines not as a must do or must happen. People respond differently. Stay strong for your family and yourself and have faith. I know it is not easy but it is a start. God be woth you and please keep us posted.",

The reason i am asking is that i am a bit surprised of the choice of Eribulin for her from the start, as Eribulin is given to women with progressing metastic cancer after they have received at dour other treatmens of chemo. Also what is her cancer status is she triple negative, er+ , her2 negative or positive is her liver mets fron breast cancer or another? Sorry i am asking so much but i found the treatment strange if it is her first diagnosis or second. Having said all this , i wosh your mom good health and improvement.¬†",

I know how scary it is to find yourself in stage IV and with liver mets, but thank God for all the treatments available. Sloan keatering is the place to be for this and i hope you get a good advice and a good oncologist.mit is very important to chose one who makes you feel comfortable and whom you trust. If you liver mets are Her2+ my guess is that they will start you with the latest and most succeful combo to date. Which is taxotere/herceptin/perjeta this is if your liver mets are still the same as your original cancer. I am getting this combo since november and the first scan showed complete response, and a week ago the second Pet scan showed the same . I will be stopping chemo this week and staying woth herceptin , perjeta and will add tamoxifen. So you see no one can tell , and i wish for you the same results hang in there and keep us posted.",

Even though ILC is sneaky and unpredictable it grows usually fairly slow to medium, i am sure your doctors will find the right meds for you to keep it stable. Mine came back after three years of the original dx and i have 10 tumors spread on both lobes with unconfirmed bone mets, until now i seem to be doing ok and fairly well with minimal symptoms or pain, thank god. Tomorrow i get my last session of chemo , than scans. So don't feel alone and most importantly don't become desperate as it will effect your overall health. I wish you good luck on your treatment and a stable condition. :)",

The Xeloda will be my third line of chemo since my first Dx. ¬†With carbo+gemzar we could not even finish the whole treatment because of cytotoxicity so i got the last two doses extremely reduced because the risks outweighted the benefit , aromasin didn't do anything at all even though i 85% estrogen positive. If i take xeloda or halaven, or nevalbine or any other, ( they are against two agents together for me, because after the carbo gemzar it will be too toxic for me) so if i fail any of these they do not believe i will respond to others. I had asked my MO on my second Dx and i made him promise that if at anytime they believe treatments are or will be no longer responsive to stop treatments so i can go home and stay near my only son and be surrounded by my family . ¬†If a treatment gives one month , or one week and it destroys your body will you still do it? I am seeing him next week , since now i am still on summer vacation and settled my son in college back home and i am seeing here also two different oncologist of which one wants to make me a lab rat hehehehe. I wil, understand exactly what he meant when i see him next week and keep you posted . I want to thank all three of you so much for all the support and care you are giving me . My love and prayers with you all. (((HUGS)). I will of course keep you posted .¬†",

He told that from the ¬†intense progression on Aromasin they can assume that i am hormone retractive, therefore an anti hormonal is no longer an option. Until now they don't have a proof that i am chemo retractive and i am still healthy and have no symptoms they expect that i will have to get a good response on xeloda. If not he told there are trial medication but since i told him i don't want that he told my husband , they will treat symptoms. He said there are no rules against doing a 4th , fifth and six but from experience they know that after the 3rd there is no response there usually is no response on others.

Navelbine, is very effective on liver mets, it is given sometimes with xeloda, so hopefully it will compensate your allergy on xeloda. But like the ladies said it causes constipation and low white blood cells. Neulesta will help the blood, it does cause bone pain for a day or two , you may want to ask for neupogen because the shots are take over a period of 5 days not one shot like neulesta and it causes no pain. My husband gave me the shots in the upper arm or upper leg you alternate. I wish you good response on navelbine. Keep us posted:))",

Fatigue was mostly towards the afternoon.i am close to finish my second cycle with increased dose. Until now i am fine, no major side effects but my bowel movement changed , i go more often. I will see when i do the blood tests of my WBC are affected , till now my blood tests are normal. My MO told me that during my one week break he may give me Neupogen as preventive measure to boost the whilte blood cells. We will talk this week to decide. He also informed me that the side effects will mainly show after the third treatment. I am not sure i am continuing with xeloda since my her2 status changed to positive. They may either add herceptin to xeloda or give me instead , herceptin, perjeta + taxol. Not decided yet. It is all so confusing. :)) ¬†",

If your T8 indicates her2 +2 then yes it is eqivoque and they will perform a FISH test which is more sensitive. However, i got two FISH test performed , they both cameback negative, even when i had + 3 at the lab. When i sent it for genomic testing a CISH test was done which came back extremely positive along with all the genes. If your Dr. Says the bone mets is not dependable she may be right since bone biopsies are so hard to pin point. But if you had a biopsy on the liver before, you can ask for the block and haveit tested in a different lab. As it appears each tumor can be in one slice negative and the other positive it depends on how it was sliced. A cancer cell can be heterogenous which means you can have both positive and negativein one cell. I am not sure CISH testing is covered by insurance since it is not a standard request.¬† I know long tirm use of xeloda would cause the blood to go crazy , i am not sure about xgeva, what i know about it is that it can bring you calcium exyremely low , so i am taking 3 tablets osteocare a day . My onc refused to give me something for low platelets when i was on carbo, he said they were too toxic he prefered to wait for them and hold the treatment until they got back to a level in which i can get the dose. I got only one blood transfusion, with WBC. I was getting five shots of neupogen after seven days of each cycle, so i never had a problem.¬† You are right it is a web lolll a never ending one :))¬† All the best to you and all of us. Your post will give hope to all the ladies on xeloda , thnx for posting.¬†",

My husband since the beginning of my disease is with in every step. He knows the truth but he choses faith and hope. My son on the other hand is the only one who knows he can lose me at any moment. He deals with by trying to make me proud of the man he is becoming and by getting closer to me at times and distancing himself at other times. I just believe it is a lot easier for me to accept what people are and deal with my problem my way. My prayers, and learning to get close to god are the strength behind all of this, and suddenly i am no longer scared. I take each day as a blessing , and live it as is.

So stay put and i hope you will see more shrinking, plus do not worry the chemo effect stays a long while in the body. Guess what ? I may not be able to get my second dose of taxol tomorrow either. My platelets plunged to 75,000 and if by tomorrow they are not up to 100,000 they cannot give me taxol, now i am worried. I will also check the tumor marker tomorrow. Yukkkk. This all messing up my plans to be with my family back home for Xmas. So pray i get my dose tomorrow. I love margaux 's name it is so french and there is no harm in revisiting Sesame street hehehe i will bring back the ever existing child in you . Do not worry too much about the fatty liver if you look you will find mist american have it, just make sure to watch the fat intake and carbs plus exercise which i am no longer doing by the way hehehe so i cannot ask to do something i don't do hehehe. Everytime inam eating my seafood i will be thinking of you and praying that one day we may meet and enjoy it together and i will eat for Chichi too even though there no lobster tastier than the main lobster.

I missed you , i hope you enjoyed your trip and took advantage of the sun to relaxe and do these walks of yours. I saw my Mo yesterday just before my session of herceptin/ perjeta, taxol he did a physical exam on me and since i told him iwa sfeeling some discimfort around the liver snd some dull pain , he told me he cannot feel the liver it is soft , it does not feel inflated or anthing, however , he thinks i have some gastro issues so he requesed a stool and urine tests and culture. And already started me on antbiotics of course plus the neupogen for the blood i get weekly three shots to keep my blood in line. I am doing fine so far on that level. Believe me i feel blessed also to have an in maid who does all the cleaning and irononing and specially when i am tired after a treatment. But here it is not as expensive as the US plus she is like part of the family. On the 22 nd , i will be heading back to lebanon with my son for my PEt on the 28 and then head back to saudi to start my fourth cycle of taxol and my fifth in herceptin cycle. I am praying a lot these days for all of us. Xoxoxoxo Spring, i had carbo / gemzar and it was very tough on my blood both carbo and gemzar , so my protocol inculded neupogen ( like neulesta ) except it is not one shot it is five daily after the 8th day, with all this i still got one blood trasfusion for red blood cells and the last two sessions where reduced because of my blood platelets low counts. It is a tough combo, eat well, and rest a lot and keep monitoring your blood , any extreme fatigue or difficulty to breathe should be reported immediatly to your doctor. Good luck on this combo , i hope it gives you good results and does a good job on shrinking those tumors. You are in my prayers. Penny, i am glad you are feeling well thanks be to God and i hope your next appointment with your Mo will give you more to be happy about. Hugs.",

I don't think the nurse can answer can answer your question , the your cardiologist and oncolgist can do that.

But it is not the end. There are many options xeloda is one of them or traditional chemo. While xeloda worked very well for some people , it did not work for other , the same as chemo. It is enough that your doctors find the right combination for you. But do not think it is the end. Most of what you used till now are anti hormonal. Chemo works very well also in controling the disease and sometimes at dessimating it. I hope your doctor finds the right one. Focus on getting well and get ready to fight. Paryers and love.",

They were many and not two only, till now i had no symptoms and my blood work is perfect. Liver mets can be with or without symptoms.

Meanwhile i hope the Nevalbine would be doing a good job on your mets. My FISH test came back negative from Roche itself and from another hospital, yet when i aksed for a genomic testing they did the CISH along with it which came back completely positive for HER2. It is worth a try. Glad to know nevalbine Is being eaiser on you than other chemos. Keep us posted .",

Then i lost most of it on my reoccurrence with liver mets , last year and the i started this combo i lost some of it but it looks fine and i didn't cover it. But in preparation i had bought a russian fur hat it is very warm and very fashionable. I know it feel bad to do the same thing over and over again it is depressing. But this is what is takes to beat up the beast. Two hours is a long way , can't you find somwhere closer? At least just a place where you can get you sessions. FISH test is done only after the biopsy in done and they determine the kind of cancer you have, and if it is ER+ /PR+ it also shows af you have an eccess of a protein called HCI if this shows as 1- then you are HER2- and if it shows 2+ then they will check with a more sensitive test called FISH to assert or deny but if your HIC is 3+ then you are HER2+. In either cases it will give them more insight on how to treat you. It is good you are changing oncologist , it is very important to be with someome you like and well read on the latest treatments and more importantly with someone with whom you can communicate , trust and be able to ask her anything you want. Ask her to explain to you all the things you do not understand. Do not be afraid of treatments no matter what they are and be a part of everything and if you do not feel right refuse it , it is your right. Yes cancer at stage IV is a full time job but you will learn very quicly to live with and embrace it beccause you want to live. With time things will settle and you go into a routine and live and function like everybody else. I am not bilittling what we endure, i am simply saying the sooner you deal with it the better you will feel and the stronger to beat it God's willing. We are all here to help you go through but of course we do not replace a good oncologist. Still anytime you want to vent, express anything need, we are all here to help and support. My prayers will be with you so you find a doctor who gives you hope treat you well . Have faith it helps. ",

It is not so strange for your TM to go down or up when there is a change in pattern during treatment. TMs tend to play up and down before settling either up or down. But i do hope it is a good sign that the treatment is working on containing the disease. Do not think much about it , rest as much as you need and if you are very tired then inform your doctor and let him fix your blood. Prayers for you all the way. Hugs.",

You did not mention if you are IDC or ILC. Even though they are both metastatic they differ slightly in treatments, and respond differently to the same treatment. I have been on taxol for almost six months. But i am not on taxol alone i am also on herceptin/ perjeta and weekly taxol. After three months my PET showed no tumors in the liver, spine , and hip and iliac bone. Many people on this thread where also on taxol and got good results. I think the choice of your doctor is a good one and i hope you respond to it as good as everyone else. I have to mention that my response was not only due to taxol alone , it was the combination of all three meds. The SEs also are different from one person to another, mine are mostly digestive ( colon) and neuropathy, i also lost my hair for the third time but not all of it . I do not wear wigs or cover, my hair thinned but is acceptable and i cut it short to make it look cute lolll. As for SBRT , ablation or anykind of invasive treatment, my doctor is like yours against , and not only my doctor. i consulted with two others they gave the same answer. To my knowledge and research very few metastatic BC patients are eligible to such procedures. Had the tumor had originated in the liver and one tumor only and not metastased then yes such procedures are successful. But once a cancer becomes metastatic and visceral ( meaning everything related to blood organs) such as bones , liver and lungs do not fit such criteria. Once the liver is hit by mets, it means that the cancer cells are circulating through the body because of the function of the liver which is to cleanse the blood. This means if you remove the tumor it will disappear but it will not stop the other circulating cells from forming another one or to set colony in other parts of the body. This is why most oncs prefer to treat the cancer systematically rather than locally. Of course this is my opinion and that of the doctors i have seen and i happen to agree with them. You should do what you feel is right for you and take into conideration the opinion of a doctor you trust and an expert in the field. I hope this helped you and wish you excellent results on taxol. Prayers and God bless you.",

If it was IDC it would have showed i have had 5 pathology reports whoch states otherwise. It would have showed . My PR disapeared the second way around , my doctor said it is normal for my age i am 56 now . What i meant it is acting like IDC is that it seems more aggressive than the traditional ILC. My doctors do not believe my response is to taxol they believe it is the her2 targetted therapies because of my history with other chemos to whoch i had barely responded. They told me before starting this combo that if the response is 20% it would be the taxol and if it was 40 to 50% it would be the HER2 meds. They certainly did not expect the complete response from what i understood . Of course for them there is no way of proving this until i pass the 6 to 8 months wothout the taxol. Even though the response of T/H/P was best ever in cancer history in a manner of progression free period the complete response was only 30% , these results are not based on people with ILC since ILC is almost never Her2 +. So this is new ground for them too. When i saw your post that you responded completely to taxol i got scared because what if mine also responded only to taxol also? So i contacted my onc who said according to my history with chemo he does not believe so, of course he cannot certify it , no one can. But he believes ot os a response to her2 meds. Our choice for tamoxifen is based on the fact that it is the only one i did not try, except for faslodex. My ER + status has also change the second way around and gace dofferent results in two different labs. In one ot said i am 85% in the second one it says i am 60% . Still my doctors believe an anti hormonal is still a viable option in my treatment. Just to make sure we close faucets for her2 to sneak in. The last scan which was almost 10 days ago showed no evidence of disease NED. This after six months of H/T/P. So now after three months we will scan again and see. It is a good idea to open an ILC thread for stage IV , there is already one but they are all under stage IV , there ILC on stage 4 forum but since each has a different treatment you may find them on different threads of the forum. I found only three or four like me who are ILC with HER2+ one i haven't heard from for a while and another who posts from time to time and who i believe created a thread for ILC her2+. I stick around here more often because i am deep in liver mers and also because i made some friends and i love the ladies here. I skim all threads from time to time of course and read , sometimes i help and others i am helped. BCO have been a great source of information support and kindness.",

Your fear is completely validated. I just want to tell you that cancer nowadays is not necesseraly a death sentence. Sciences have advanced very much in the last decade and treatments are better. I understand your fear and frustration specially when you live healthy and do everything right. Unfortunately, cancer does not differentiate between healthy or not, there are many factors when it comes to it a lot of which make no sense. From what i understood is that you had no lumps, this sounds like you have ILC , which stands for invasive lobular carcinoma. It is known not to cause lumps. This is only my guess, of course after the do the pathology report you will have all the details. Cry, scream, yell do not let anything inside, it will help you to calm down and get a clearer picture. It is not one you would have hoped for yourself but it will help to be ready to fight , survive and thrive with cancer. May you one day look back and see it as a bad dream. Good luck to you and wishes from the heart that you will go into remission for a long long time. My prayers and the prayers of all these wonderful ladies on this board are with you.",

Keep your feet well hydrated after treatment , use petrolium jelly (vaseline) it relieves the tightening you will feel in the feet. Warm bath helped me. There is also some bones pain. Of course each one has different side effects. It is a good chemo for cancer , so i hope it will stop the progression and and stabilize you. My prayers are with you. Hugs.",

You see i am a transformer too and an unlikely one since i am ILC . but all of my oncs and there are four of them opted for the one I mentioned . And they were right, after three months of treatmen it got me to NED and that was a year ago. My advice to you is to ask your onc why he chose kacyla? And why not Herceptin/perjeta taxotere? After six months on taxol i was put on herceptin , perjeta only every 21 days till now. Please ask him and insist on using this combo first. As kadcyla has some success stories but not nearly close to H/P . Good luck to you. ",

I am glad and happy your husband was able to attend your treatments. I am not sure xeloda and taxotere are good together they maybe too much. Since you responded to taxol the first time and may respond to docetaxel as well and then go on xeloda alone. Seek a second opinion if you are not comfortable with this one also like kaayborg said check out cancer centers. I hope taxotere on its own will do a good job , it is a tough chemo and it is likely to lowe your WBC. On its own but you can always get a neulesta shot or neupogen after each dose to keep your WBC in check. What you have in your mouth is from taxotere not xeloda . The worst of xeloda is hand and foot syndrom which is neuropathy , unfortunately taxotere also causes it. So you were getting a double effect. I hope you onc finds soon the right combination in which yoy feel comfortable and is tough on cancer. You are in my prayers with wishes of good health and healing thoughts. Happy Thanksgiving.",

Wishing you a clear second scan in the coming months. :)) Kaayborg and Artists, My initial reaction on my second dx with liver mets was horrible because it came around Xmas. My husband and I had a tearful one thinking this would be my last. But as i started my tx and even though they were not famous the little voice in my head stopped all my energy was focused on the now and the thought that i may actually survive this , ( well at least for a while) . I thought for now i am alive and i do not want to think about later because it will hinder the one i have now. It is not easy to shut that little voice but once it is done , you feel the difference and it pushes you further. I hope you both get to this place and enjoy your lives for a long time.",

However, it was helpful in assreting that i am Her2+ after two negative FISH. it changed my whole treatment to which i responded very will and i still do. My second dx my her2 was equivocal which was totally negative in my first dx. To me this was the right test to do. I was about to request the sensitivity test but then i had a change of heart. I can tell you that genomic testing will name each gene your cancer has and a recommendation as a conclusion as to how you may respond to each chemo or targeted therapy. I read on bco that there is a genomic testing kit in the US and it costs 200$ it was not the one i did. Mine was fairly costly. I hope this helped , my advise is for you to choose the one you feel is more adequate to your case. :)",

I also like you have been NED for a year and five months. But lately like you , i have a little pain on the right side, reflux and indigestion. I , like you feel that something is going on. My last PET/CT showed fatty changes in the liver but no activity , lesions on bones but also with no activity. When i told my onc about the right side pain , she ordered an xray. It showed nothing. What i want to tell you is that there may be mild changes and your markers have doubled but still in the normal range, even if not for your usual normal. This does not mean your treatment will not work whether your onc waits one month before changing or not. I know talking is easier than doing. But like Alissa said , have a good cry and then sit and think. Do not make rash decisions out of panic. If you trust your onc , then you wait this month. If you do not feel comfortable with her decision then look for a new one. From what i know liver mets are not resectable except in rare cases . If you have only one lesion you maybe be candidate , you can always check it out. Please do not think it is the beginning of the end even if there is a mild activity. There are options and resection may be one of them. Your symptoms maybe be something else. If God forbids it is a progression , then you prepare yourself for a fight, don't let cancer beat you and most importantly don't let it ruin what you have with your family and your life. My prayers are with you and i hope you soon get to put your mind at ease. I will be thinking of you , please keep us informed. Hugs",

Chemo does not shrink the liver it shrinks the mets , once the tumors shrink if your liver is enlarged , it will go back to its normal size. However, the pain may not be the same pain you felt before chemo, it could be from the treatment. Since your numbers are down it could be that the cancer is dying and when it dies it hurts. It is a sign that the treatment may be working and the dying cells hurt. Wishing you more and more decrease in numbers .",

I was diagnosed in 2010 with stage III ILC , i was treated with ACT and femara. December 2013 went for check on hip pain and was dxd with liver mets 10 spots on the liver the largest less than 1cm, confirmed by liver biopsy . So now i am stageIV ER+ , just started my first carboplatin+ gemzar round. My onc opted for chemo for three rounds of one week combo and one week gemzar alone. After three rounds he will scan . I am so happy and glad to have found you ladies , you are all heroes and you gave me hope. I had a fatty liver since my first chemo but never had liver pain, just some bloating which I always thought my colon. Now after chemo i sometimes have a very faint pain along the stomach level and right rib side which is subsiding. I wish you all a long life and i hope we kick this cancer to hell. One question is a reoccurrence of ILC with mets considered metastatic breast cancer? I never got this part... üòäüòäüòä ¬†",

You seem to have become a triple negative from what i read in your post. Of course this limit your treatments to chemo only, but it does not mean it won't work. There are some ladies who are on chemo only and they are doing well. Liver mets usually are harder than elswhere in the body since it is visceral meaning it hit a vital organ and also it means that the cells are capable of travelling somewhere else in the body and colonize. But is is not hopeless. Your doctor cannot predict any outcome unless he tried everything in his power, to stop the disease from progressing to other parts of the body. Find an oncologist with whom you feel comfortable and who knows his stuff instead of one who brings your hope down. Don't get discouraged and find a doctor who can treat you right in order for you to survive. Hope is half the treatment for this disease. I hope you get a right treatment to stabilize your cancer and gives you a good quality of life. Good luck and keep us posted.¬†",

It fills me with pride and overwhelms my emotions. It is such an adult review on cancer in the family and so perceptive. Love to all. I am a very proud mom.¬† American University of Beirut English 203: Reading Response 1 Professor Rima Deeb 201501175] A FAMILY DISEASE1 It spread through our family like the Black Death, a plague that ate away at the insides of every single one of us in a way that was worse than any real malady could have caused. Itdevoured me in such a way, that I got to a point where I really could feel nothing anymore. Iwas a walking emotionless drone, wandering around waiting for his life to end. I stopped talking to my friends, I stopped going out, I was just lost for so long. I even started trying to distance myself from my mother, subconsciously I think maybe I didn\u2019t want it to be as painful when it was time to say goodbye. Thankfully, that part of my life is over now, I have decided to take whatever time I have left to make something out of my relationship with my mother and to try making her happy and proud of who I have become. Dad on the other hand, he was pretending everything was fine. Not being the most vocal person about his emotions, he uses this as a way to cope with such situations. And to this day, and now, where to me everything seems worse than it has ever been, I think he still doesn\u2019t really understand the gravity of what is going on. \u201cDon\u2019t worry habibeh mom will be fine\u201d he said (habibeh is Arabic for dear), when even the doctors said at this point, all they can do is slow the progression and perhaps if lucky stop it. My dad is not very social, coming from a rough background and a difficult childhood; he has given me everything I have ever wanted because as a child he got nothing from his dad. He\u2019s living his dreams through me.When he is faced with the possibility of losing his wife, his only true friend, his best friend, he just blocks it out. Instead of dealing with it, he pretends it is not there, and who can blame him really? Mom shocked me. She became a stronger person than I could have ever imagined. She turned into Supermom. In her mind she had to teach me all the lessons she learned in life in a structured daily schedule of lengthy lectures where attendance was mandatory. It was like taking an intensive foreign language course. All she really wants is to make sure that I will be alright when she\u2019s gone, even when she knows that after eighteen years with her I know how to take care of myself. She spent those last eighteen years not only giving me lessons on morals and values but also teaching me to care and love and have hope for the world through the unconditional love and care that she has offered me, and that I regret to say I take for granted sometimes. You\u2019re probably wondering by now, \u201cWhat in the name of God is he rambling about?\u201d I think it\u2019s time you found out. Let me take you back to the first day when this all started, five years ago. I was lying down on my couch in my bedroom watching televisionwith my cat gently purring at my side. When suddenly I get this feeling that I had to go see my mom. So I get up and go to the living room only to find her on the phone with the mostserious face on. That\u2019s when I knew she was talking to her doctor. She had recently had surgery to remove a small benign tumor from her left breast. Right under that tumor though the doctor found an even smaller (under than one millimeter) growth which he removed and biopsied. He called to give the results. My mom started sobbing and that\u2019s when I had realized what was going on and went into shock. My mom was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma, a relatively rare form of breast cancer that affects five to ten percent of all people who get breast cancer. Seeing as her tumor was so small the doctor thought that it was still in its early stages. However more surgery proved that in fact the cancer was now metastatic and had probably spread to other body part with no visible effect yet on any scan.Chemotherapy was started immediately and for a year we all went through hell. This brought good news though, the cancer was gone and she was in remission. She was also to start a hormonal treatment for five years and have regular scans every six months. Everything was fine for three years. Everything except this giant hovering black cloud above my head that maybe one day, this thing would come back to haunt my family as it once did. Sadly, last year, it did. But not only had it come back it had also come back in her liver. A second round of chemo was started, and this only reduced the size of the tumors by about twenty percent, we were hopeful. However the chemo put her body in really bad shape and the doctors had to stop or she would\u2019ve died from treatment. Subsequently a second hormonal treatment was started. Three months later, when she did her scan, the cancer had proliferated extensively and had now also invaded the spinal column and the hip bone as well as increasing its grip over her liver by a great deal. At the moment she is on another type of chemotherapy, all we can do now is slow it down, hopefully stop it for a few years, but that\u2019s it. My mother is dying from this disease at one point in time or another so all I can do is make her happy and spend my time with her. This is made difficult by the fact that at the moment I am living in Lebanon alone and she went back to Saudi Arabia because her insurance does not cover the medication here. I talk to her every day though, and I know that getting an education is what is important and it\u2019s also what she wants for me. I miss her sometimes, but at least I see her every month and a half or so, so it\u2019s not too bad. Some part of me still hopes that I\u2019m going to wake up and this was all a dream, or that by some divine miracle bestowed upon my mother for her unimaginably strong faith, her body would be completely clear of this disease. So I pray. I pray that whatever God has planned for this family, let it be for the greater good even though it may seem bad for now. I also pray that when it is time for her to go (hopefully a long time from now) she goes inpeace. Not in pain, not on drugs. It\u2019s a lot to ask considering how this disease functions, but maybe God will grant his unworthy believer this one favor. ¬†",

I got my results for molecular intelligent test because my liver biopsy showed some change in HER2 status so a FISH test was performed and came back negative. However, the genomic test came back positive for HER2 and showed that i may benefit from all Her2 targeted therapies and all HER2 pan inhibitors. It also showed that i would benefit of all anthracycline such as taxotere , doxil paclitaxel , ellence etc... It also showed another kind camptosar as a potential benefit. However, it showed no response on Gemzar ( i got gemzar as first therapy after my reoccurence) . It is confusing as a result and it requires a multiple options and opinions. I am waiting for two cancer boards to decide what to do. For now i am still on xeloda till further notice, with a little increase in tumor marker. I hope these info helped. Love to all. ¬†",

But don't be scared, be strong and fight to get better, there are options and treatments , you have to believe that or it will destroy you. Xeloda seems like a good option, i am on it for the time being and on high dosage 2500mg twice daily for 14 days and rest one week. So far no major side effects, but my onc told me it will start showing after the third cycle.¬† Your results for pathology for hormonal status will most likely be the same as your original tumor the PR will depend on your age .¬† After my liver biopsy showed some action on the Her2 front and there was a big confusion about it, i had a genomic test to determine my cancer genes. The results showed that i would benefit from her2 therapies and taxanes. So the test is helping in shaping my next treatment , god forbids i get a progression on Xeloda. The test may not be covered by insurance or medic care. I paid for it myself. Since i sent it to Germany it was quite costly 6500$ , i do not know if it is less expensive in the US since it is done there. I hope this helped. I personally told my son the truth since the beginning he was 14 when i was first diagnosed the second time around he was 18 . So i explained everything to him calmly and i told him i am not scared that i will fight this. We are fighting this disease as a family and with the strength from God.

Before my cancer mutated to her2 positive, i was put on aromasin and it didn't work alone, then i was put on Xeloda which succeeded partially in containing the disease but didn't finish the treatment since my change in .her2 status compelled my doctors to consider another options. But before that, my doctor had told me that if xeloda does not work he was considering putting on Avastin and taxol . He told me he knows Avastin is no longer part of the treatments in the USA however , it is widely in use in Europe and with some people it is giving good results. So i hope your mom is one of those people , already taxol should do a good job and hopefullyy Avastin will continue the rest. You did not mention what was your mom's first diagnosis was she IDC or ILC, lobular or ductal cancer? I hope soon your mind is put at ease. Keep us posted. You may want to check on the stage IV forum if there is a thread in Avastin. I know some ladies on the board had it, but i do not remember whom. Good luck to your mom and prayers",

He had told me he will be checking it every three weeks , but the fact that one session was cancelled and before he does the next he checked again he wanted to know my CA level, but it worried me . If this could combination is not doing any good then i am in trouble. Did u have your CA rising before you hit the second session of your first cycle? Now i know simetimes it does that, and he told me not to worry and that it is not an indication before we finish the cycle . Still my mind is over working. Any toughts? ",

Enjoy your ride of shrinking tumors and be happy. All chemos almost all of them, are cumulative as far as SEs do not worry but be aware that if the fatigue hinders your daily activity and you are unable to do small things and regular things you should inform your doctor so he can check your blood low white blood cells will cause the fever and the fatigue may be caused by anemia, so he can give you proper help. The foot pain may be neutropenia which is caused by may types of chemo if it is low it will stay low but if increases you may feel tingling in the tows growing pain in muscles and somtimes bones. Again if the pain grows and u feel some swelling inform your onc. These pains can be also caused by low blood counts . I hope nevalbine will continue shrinking these tumors to oblivion. I had my herceptin/ perjeta yesterday in which i napped again for 4 hours hehehehe. All my infusions are given to me me very slowly to avoid and watch anallergic reaction. So far so good. I am travelling today back home to lebanon , to spend the holiday's with my son and family, my husband will follow on the 23rd. I will have my second cycle entirely there. Holiday cheers to all of us ! Hugs.",

Syrmom, you should never be sorry on how you feel or how this disease transformed you. It did a number on all of us. None of us is the same. It is ok to feel how you feel , otherwise you are not human. It is so hard to keep a brave facade , when every one around is living and getting on with their lives. Nothing about this disease is normal, everytime you think you forgot about it , it keep coming back to remind it is still here and it is in control. It takes it's toll on all of us. So get angrey, aloof , rebel against it , it will still be ok. I completely am with you. Sometimes i would be talking about something in the future tehn suddenly, irealise that i would not be here to do it, sadly , i shut up and i cut the discussion. Then other times i am ok and i want to defy the disease and i keep talking. You are not alone in this believe me. I hope , you start again your chemo and this time around it will be gentker to you. Keep us posted and take care of yourself. My prayers are with you.",

This is the TM i do and the last time there a drop in number. So let's hope it is a good sign that the combo is working. Still , istarted to get nervous because the results will be decisive of whether i continue with it which would be great or ... Well really not too many options if it is not the case. I am back home now in Lebanon , my son start uni on monday and my scan will be wednesday. Ususally, they make me wait to talk to the doctor afteri am finished with the scan and he can give some pointers. But will talk to my onc she can get a verbal results by wednesday night.

Which blood is low the red i presume since you are talking about iron. I do not think you should take iron pills anyway usually they are not gove with chemo. I do not get why you are so fatigued how much are you getting on the reduced dose? My fulls dose was 80mg per square meter of my weight they reduced ot to 60 after my first session because it tired me so much and lowered my blood, they had to postpone the next one. At low dosage of taxol i am feeling ok. I have a little anemia but not enough to get me so fatigued, i just get a bit tired mainly because of my lack of sleep. Also the low dosage is not effecting the efficiency of the med. ask your doctor about this. The food does not taste good to me specially i cannot taste salt , so add more sices to make it appealing, my appetite is fine but i am not likng the food so much but i eat anyway. Instead of iron tr to eat liver , it is know to strengthen the blood , lentils, spinach these foods are know to strengthen it. Also have from time to time a glass of red wine , it is a lood booster and not harmful if taken spearingly. From your SEs i am guessing they are giving you docetaxel ? If so then the side effects are warranted because when i took it at my first dx it was horrible, then really the food becomes tasteless and you get tired. I am getting paclitaxel it is much kinder . I am though and so proud of you of the little walks you are taking, and little by little is not so bad it will build up your strength and boost your immune system specially that you are breathing well. This is wonderful. I am glad you like your new cardiologue and i hope he benefits you and follow you meticulously. Keep taking these small walks as they are good for the body and the soul and try to eat better don't weaken your body from lack of food. My love and prayers are with you and my our sweet lord help through this treatment and all God's willing will not be in vain and you will get good results. Hugs. ",

I know how it is to hear and feel the fear of running out of options. But a lot of drugs are coming out and being tried, i did not hear about the drug you have mentioned and i hope and pray it is the right one. I know however, of palbociclib along with another drug was newly approved and is used for he2 negative who did not respond to other chemos , you might want to check this with your onc . I hope you soon start on a new journey one of many with this disease with a new lease on life. Hope and prayers are with you",

But do not panic , some cances really do not respond to Adriamycin it does not mean they will not respond to another kind of chemo. You are only on the second line chemo and still have plenty to try. So please, take a deep breath and focus with your doctors to get better and get the right treatment. Your daughter isn't she the one who was drunk last time and had a fight with her husband? If so , you should not give what she says too much attention. If she drinks often then you know that alcohol changes people and make them detached completely from reality. I do not believe she hates you but hates the disease, because maybe she is scared of losing you , even if she is an adult. Give yourself and her time for both of you to calm down so you can eventually talk. Right now focus on yourself and on getting better and God's willing you will. But you need to keep your inner strength and get ready to fight yet again and again against this disease. For this you need to be hopeful and strong to be able to beat it. Having your tumors markers rise does not mean you are going to die, it means the cancer is active again and rising and your doctor will change therapy. My prayers are with you and don't be hurt from what your daughter says , be sure she does not hate you , she is just lost and eventually she will come around. Love, hugs and prayers are with you , keep us posted.",

I also take xgeva every 4 weeks till now i have no problem with it either. While xeloda did not work for me completely , i say completely because it has some kind of mix response which my doctors did not like and consiered a failure. But xeloda did wonders to others . You can find a thread here it is called \" all about xeloda\" whoch will be helpful for you. It is taken twice a day and off one week. They may increase the dose later.wishing you good luck on the new drug and prayers it will do wonders for you.",

You mentionned you had after twelve 12 years seen liver spots and were started right away on anto hormonal. Was a biopsy performed on the liver in 2012? If not then this is all wrong , a biopsy should be performed to identify if the liver is consistent with your primary tumor 12 years ago , if it has changed or if it is another type of cancer all together. You are stage IV cancer and yes stage four unfortunately we are continously in treatment. It is crucial that you have biopsy performed on both liver and lungs to corrolate with your first cancer and see if it is the same or stauts has changed in term of ER ,PR, or HER2 or if it is totally a different cancer. Some of us started in stage four on chemo and others on anti hormonal , some on both some on other therapies. The main prpose of the therapiesare ti conain the disease or to stop progression , in very rare case to cure. It is along process and patienc is the key word. A lot of us lead almost a normal life. With some ups and downs of course.i urge to make sure you are well diagnosed and this includes biopsies so they can treat you properly. Chemo is a big part of treatment if this fails then you are put on trial medicat. i Hope this helped. ",

Once the biopsy is done you doctors will be able to choose the right med for you. Have hope , i am also lobular and it has been a year since my liver and bone mets. I am still here and so are others. Inoray you soon get a clearer picture which will ease your mind, heal your body and lift you up. Keep us posted",

At first since my WBC were low i had neupogen but later i quit neupogen all together and i am doing fine. I still have one dose and i will finish with taxol yayyy. I will co tinue though on hercept/ perjeta every 21 days. I hope halaven keeps working for you with ease and few side effects.

I think getting a lower dose is helpful while increasing the number . For me it was either 80 per m2 every 21 days or 60 weekly. I went for the latter and cut down on neupogen after a while. After next week i will be on tamoxifen and herceptin/ perjeta as i took before aromasin , i didn't work and femara for three years, arimidex is the same as femara so my on. And I decided to try tamoxifen rather than faslodex. I hooe halaven is doing a god job for you . When will you scan ? Hugs and prayers.",

By the way salt water pools are actually very nice it is very fashionable in my country since they make the pools along the beaches so they use the sea water and filter it to the pool. Tbis way the water is always clean plus you get the benefit of floating like in the ocean lollll. It is quiet enjoyable. I hope you get to try one. Love and prayers to you all. :))",

I do not understand why PET/CT is not reliable for you. I use the same and it is very informative. And i am ILC . it could be the bones. Mine showed three months after my initial treatment for liver mets. I had no symptoms and was feeling fine. If your onc thinks it is the bones maybe this is why he is requesting MRI even thoughif it is bone the forst thing he should do is a bone scan then a PET or a scan . PET shows all the hypermetabolic activity in the body and most doctors rely on it to know where the cancer is ir where it is headed. Whether you are ILC or anything else. Keep us posted on what happens. My prayers are with you and don't stay too long without posting :))) missed you .",

I do not take a lot of pills , i was precribed solpadeine when i was first dxd after the surgery , it is basically paracetamol , codeine and caffeine. I frankly never used it so much. Now i have naproxene which i also rrarely used. I do have some pain between now and then but i choose not to take anything as long as it is bearable and the pain goes away. All the treatments we are subjected to cause pain . As for drinking . I am not a heavy drinker , i am an occasional one. I do have a beer or a glass of wine between now and then. Some meds will raise thenliver enzymes this why onc prefer to have us quit them so there is no confusion between progression or the liver reacting to some med. i was taking a statin my onc stopped it and told me to go on a cholesterol diet because it was rasing my liver enzymes. Anything can raise liver enzymes from panadol to the chemo we take. So i am carfeul but not onssessed about it. To all the newbies i say welcome to this thread and i am sorry we are all here and to the rest i say do everything in moderation unless you are told otherwise. Prayers and love to all ! ",

All i know is that CISH gave me more options which in turn gave me more time. It is also not standard yet so it is not covered by insurances or others. It was apprived by the FDA in 2008. But my liver biopsy was borderline Her2 this is why i was tested for FISH , also after my genetic testing on the sample sent to Germany my cancer showed to be hetergenous. Meaning, this same sample contained places which were full of her2 copy while another slice showed none. But the doctor who studied the sample told my onc to start me right away on her2 targeted therapies. The test also stated what chemo i will most likely respond to and which less likely and which not at all. All results were backed up with scientific studies ranging from reliable to less reliable.

Because PET scan are used mainly to meausure all hypermetabolic activity in the body , they use a specific acticity called FDG uptake and the SUV is the speed which indicate how fast the activity is. So even if it does not show the activity is read on the hot spots in the body. PET scans are not used only on one area of the body they are used all over to check for mets . My liver mets showed first on a contrast scan , however bone mets were neither confirmed or denied by MRI or bone scan. They did not show on the first scan or they did show but with no activity. After using Aromasin for three months they lit like a christmas tree. You are right ultrasounds with contrast are effective in detecting liver mets. But please inquire more about PET to my knowledge it is still till now the most accurate in detecting mets in the body because it counts on tracers injected in your body and not only on the scan. Thank you for your warm and genuine happiness for my results , i wish the same for you and everyone on this board. I am very thankful to God and overwhelmed . I take it day by day and let him lead :) . I hope your next scan will give you good results and for real nothing shows. Kisses and keep me posted and don't disapear lolll.",

Meaning mybreast tumor was very small less than 1cm but the lymph nodes status was very high including two axiallaries 21/23 grade 2. So i had lumpectomy, lymph nodes dossection and Axilliaries. Did ACT full cycles for four months . Then i had radiotherapy and started Femara for three years . Then jan 2014 i was dxd with liver mets consistant with the primary tumor ER+PR-and HER2 equivoque meaning borderline. So it was sent for FISH Which came back negative. I had a total of 10 tumors in my liver the largest 2.5 cm the rest minimal. So i was started on carboplatiin + gemzar for six cycles each which reduced my tumors by 20% . Then i got Aromasin during summer of 2014 for three months after which i had a PET which showed progression in the liver and unmber of tumors increased and also showed bone mets on the spine, right hip , lower back plenty of them. They sarted me on xeloda , and was told i was running out of options. Xeloda failed but during this time i had received the results for the genomic testing which stated that i am highly her2+ . So i was started taxolH/P after three months a PET showed complete disapearance of both liver and bone tumors. They were totally gone nothing. No activity . Nothing. I did my PET a week ago still showing the same results . Tuesday will be my last taxol dose. My onc intends to strat me on tamoxifen along with herceptin Perjeta . And we will take it from there. . We will see . I also take xgeva for the bones. As i took pills for the bones , once monthly before. My cancer is ILC but it seems to be behaving more like IDC the strange thing is that my mitotic rate is too slow. It is really confusing so i will take it day by day. I told my onc about you , he said it is extremely rare for an ILC to respond completely like you did to chemo.. So i have to wait and see .",

Plus it's specific function. True i seem to have a very variated cancer in each cell. I was told the same thing by my onc when i was first dxd , that ILC is indolent and very slow growing. Well mine does not seem to fit this criteria it may be slow grwing but it seems to be diffuse. Being able to use her2+ therapies was not only helpful it was a life saving option. I was nor responding to any kind of chemo known. So even though her2 is very agressive , the option i got actually saved my life or i would have already moved to palliative. The reson i am using tamoxifen instead of faslodex , is that there are no studies done on herceptin/perjeta and faslodex. There are some studies regarding femara and others and the recommandation is moderate. Since i got the maximum time with taxol plus maximum response , i have to go on hercept/perjeta alone and since i am still fairly ER+ my onc and I made a decision to take an anti hormonal to cover ER+ possibility for the cancer to soread through it. I have already taken femara and aromasin . One worked for three years and the second got me to bone mets. Arimidex is the same family as femara so we decided i would try tamoxifen, since before the aromatase inhibitors it was the drug of choice for all cancers and it worked. Meanwhile we will keep the PET scan every three months for a year if there is no progression , then we will start doing it every six months and so on. Faslodex by itself is very strong. I have been on very heavy chemo for a year. My body needs to rest and frnakly my doctors prefer me healhty and well rather than heavily medicated and in bed. As long as there is no need for it. I am satisfied with the decision and we will see how it worked three months from now. As for opening a section for ILC stage IV advise you to open it in stage IV usually all stage IV topics are together and anyone who is not stage IV should not post in them. Frankly it may be depressing for those who are in a lesser stage and it may scare them or cinfuse them. To tell you the truth and from what i understood from my doctors and the reading i have done. No one really knows much about ILC since it is not a very common cancer. Only 15% of all cancers are ILC in the last few years it became 20% and it started to get noticed. ILC usUally happen to women of age 50 and above except now younger women are getting it . So it was usually treated the same as IDC. it is only in the last two years that doctors started to think that maybe they should use a different strategies. Since treatments are becoming more indivualized for each person whether IDC or ILC. As you may have noticed each person with the same thoe of cnacer resoond differently to the same regimen. So even if you ask each persin what treatment they got , it may give you option but not a solution. For example a lot of women and mainly ILC took xeloda and it worked for them, yet other s it did not do anything , me among them. The other one is chemo ILC is know not to respond to chemo fully like IDC due to its low mitotic rate and the nature of the cancer , yet you responded totally to taxol. While i didn't respond to three major chemos. This is why my doctors are not sure that it was tacol who got me to NED. This is why they will wait . I could go either in remission or reoccurrence , both possibilites are valid in my case. All i was told is that in the regimen i took and in the stage i was in and the intensive tumors in both my liver and spinal bones a complete response is only about 20%. As total remission is 10%. I do not know where i stand in all this but i can only hope and pray. I do not go that deep anymore into this like i use to because it is very tiring and it prevents me from taking advantage of the time i am alive to actually live and enjoy it. But of course when a new decision have to be made , i would like to take part in it. If i feel it is right for me i do it and if i don't , i refuse it. Lollll i am sure i lost you somewhere , but i hope this helped you. I also hope you get the right treamtent one with which you feel comfortable with and one which is able to stop your cancer or eliminate it. I pray for each and everyone of us to have a long and healthy life. God bless you. :))",

I took xeloda during this time it didn't work for me as it gave mixed response . My doctor started to talk to me about palliative care. But something great happened after two negative FISH for HER2+ i got the results of my genetic testing as you know i got positive results. So i started another treament for her2+ plus taxol. With this combo after three months my PET showed clear both in the liver and bones as well as the second PET after three month. Now i am due for scanning in August and hope my stauts did not change. Usually onc do not scan before three cycles unless there is a need. I hope your treatment will show the same results after three months. But remember also with stage IV stable is good. The most important thing is to containthe disease so it won't spread somewhere else. I am glad you are enjoying your time with your son and wish you few side effects and a great response. Be patient loll.",

But now i am off taxol , only herceptin/perjeta plus tamoxifen. My next scan will be in September. However, my tumor markers showed some increase whch my onc dismissed. It rose to 32 from 28. It worries me . We will see in september or on the next blood test whch will be in 2 weeks. God bless you , you are always full of energy and i hope you stay like this for a longtime . Xoxox",

The only one who can advise you about SIRT and ablation to the liver is Penny and she is presently at the hospital. But to my knowledge not many people woth liver mets are canditate to invasive procedures. Even though one tumor disappear another one comes out instead. So i will advise you to see more than one opinion before you cnsider such procedures. I hope you get inspired and a good onc who will advise you correctly. Welcome again and hope to see more posts from you with the same lively spirit as this one.",

However, i am a bit confused why was carboplatin added to the regimen. The regimen is usually only taxotere /herceptin/perjeta. Every 21 days for six months or reduced weekly taxol with every 21 days herceptin perjeta. Some people continue for a year. This regimen is very doable and not so bad and the quality of life is good. I did carboplatin before this one , it wore me down completely because of the effects it has on the red blood cells and general fatigue. It wore me down with very little effect , only 20% shrinkage on the liver. Taxol/herceptin/ perjeta after three months gave me complete response. And my second scan just before i stopped taxol gave me no evidence of active disease. My last taxol was last week . Now i will start tamoxifen along with herceptin /perjeta wvery three weeks, and see what happens. If you are ER- your doctor may continue this regimen for a year or stopit due to toxicity. But to my knowledge carboplatin cannot be given for more than8 cycles max. You could ask him to drop it completely and continue till the end of six months with taxol/herceptin perjeta and see what happens. As for invasive procedures i happen to agree with your doctor. Liver mets are very rarely candidate for such procedures. While a procedure may make a tumor disappear amd you feel well for a while another one will pop out , plus the procedures tire the liver eventually. So think about it carfeully before you push for it more. Stage four has no time table you are always on medicarions and it depends on progressions. Taxol/herceptin/perjeta has the longest progression free periods in the history of Her2+ cancers when the body responds to it. I understand how run down you are but i am fairly sure it is the carboplatin side effects not the rest. Meanwhile, if you continue to six months , i hope you get complete response , this way they can give some rest from chemo for a while. I am very happy for your results and i hope it reduces to nil. God be with you and guide you to make the right decision. ",

I heard that when tumors die in some cases they cause the tumor markers to go up but i am not sure of the accuracy of it all. But i do know sometimes they do rise for other reasons then progression. In all cases believe if it was worrisome your onc would have investigated further. Mine rose 4 points after i got results on my scan of no evidence of active disease. As for feeling something in the liver , i feel a bit of pain after each session , i also have discomfort on the right side upwards. But nothing shows on the PET. Again congrats on the wonderful news, i am celebrating with you in spirit and prayers for us all.",

If your bone mets were rightly controlled it would not have gotten to your liver. It is wrong to start you on a combo without biopsy to the liver. Because once you started the chemo , they will not be able to get good resutls or accurate ones. Cancer mutate yes, some don't but a lot do. If your cancer status have changed then you may need a different treatement.it may change from ER+ to minus the same for PR and HER 2 status also. I really think something is wrong when you are progressing so fast and you have notseen your onc since May. This is not good nor responsible from his side. Who is relating all these info to you? Not getting your chemo before biopsy is really bad. YOU MUST INSIST on one. It will not kill you to wait a little. Your onc should help with the appointment. Getting a second opinion is beneficial for you , because it may save your life. My cancer is ILC which is usually ER AND PR positive , the first thing my onc asked is for a biopsy. Eventhough i had extensive mets in both lobes, we waited the results then started on a treatment. My her2 became equivoque, my ER WENT DOWN TO 60% my PR went to zero. So i took the specimen to another center and had sent abroad, while being treated (which was failing) after six months i got the results from abroad that my status on HER2 was deffinitly positive. I was running out of options and my tumors were barely controled , i had progression to my spine, hip, and some other areas. So i was started on her2 targeted therapies plus taxol. Since januray i have no evidence of disease anywhere in my body. I hope it continues now i am only on her2 meds plus nolvadex. My next PET is in august. So as you can see biopsy is important , you may not get the results you want but i will surely give a map to your doctor on howto treat you. Ablationand all these procedures are not suitable for all metsters specially when the liver is envolved. Very few havesuccesful results on them. Some of these ladies here did it but after a while another mets popped out. If you are not cnadidate for it i advise to forget it. I realise it is hard to do all this on your own with no one to help, but you have to do this for yourself. You have to be able and aware of all your options and everything should be explained to you. All the alternatives discussed. It is your right. I wish you the best of luck and i hope you soon biopsy and get started on your treatment which i hope would be a successful one. Praying for you . Please keep us posted .",

Cortisone is effective in such situation but maybe you should get a shot and nota topical treatment. Sorry i cannot help you much as it never happenned to me. I hope you soon get some relief.",

Just last week i had an xray to both my ribs and sides and nothing showed. Nothing is showing on PET and i am currently NED and considered in remission. A week before that i had an xray to my knee which was hurting also it. Turned out i have a bad case of arthritis , nothing to do with cancer. So your pain may not be necessarily related to your cancer but it can be related to treatments, age, weight and so on... I hope it is the latter , it is better to investigate then worry or wonder. I have the same pain you have and i have no liver mets at least not one which are seen. I hope you soon have a clear reason.",

I am not from the US but i do know the area and lived in New York longtime ago. The first thing you have to do is have a biopsy done on your liver mets to make sure it is cancer and if it is the same type as your primary cancer. This is very important before starting any treatment. The second thing is that if it is cancer and confirmed treaments depends on what your oncologist decides to give you , but i can tell you that it will be in the least every 21 days and in some combos it could be weekly. As for driving that far it depends on how the meds will effect you as side effects varies between individuals. But you defintely need to start in a good centre . Stage IV cancer entails constant treatment with maintenance treatment. It is for as long as you live and respond to the treaments. It would be much better if you are able to be closer to a good hospital. I hope my answers helped. I hope more than the biopsy denies the liver mets and if not do not be afraid there a re a lot of efficient treatments and you will make it. My prayers are with you and your family.",

I hope you do not let this comment get to you. You are newly diagnosed and this is overwhelming for you it is understandable. But you may to relate to him, that MANY ladies are living with a stage IV and many other have lived with it for years. I am stage IV since 2014. I had more than 15 tumors in my liver both lobes and multiple bone mets on most of my skeleton , i have been with no evidence of disease since a year and a half. Two treatments before failed and one worked. Also it is true that sometimes mets hurt but others like Shetland said they hurt when they are healing and the cells are dying , they hurt just as much. Think about it this way . Please, do not listen to anyone , learn to listen to your body and do not think that every pain is cancer just because you have cancer. Other things hurt too and treatments hurt also. Keep in mind there are some ladies who have been living with the disease for 25 years other for 15 and other and others. Positive thinking is part of the treatment and so is faith and belief in yourself unless you have a reason to believe otherwise do not be afraid. I am really insulted by your friends words and it made me angry but I hope you rise above this and beat the disease , this way you make him swallow his words. We are here for you anytime. Hugs",

But let me tell you your onc is not wrong iv chemo is not much worse than pills or any other. It all depends on each individual and how we respond to it. I had four courses of chemo and lived pretty much a normal life without the hair of course but the quality of life was ok. As for xeloda my feet were hindering my daily life . If you still have some place where you still progressing and others no then the treatment is not fully benefitting your cancer. Taxol is a good chemo for cancer , i took it weekly on low doses for 6 months along with other meds and it worked wonders for me. There is also another lady who did only taxol it got her to NEAD for one year. It really all depends on what your doctor believes , he still knows best. And do not be afraid of chemo . Our bodies are beaten every day by different things not only chemo. This is the reality of cancer. You have to be comfortable with yourself , keeping your strength has nothing to do with the meds. It is you inner strength which will fight your cancer not your body on his own. I hope you soon find your way and find peace in the decisions you make.",

As i see you have been on abraxane for a year , how are the side effects and how long does he intend to keep you on it? And how is the quality of life? As it seems i am the only one of the ILC group who did not do a mastectomy or a prophylactic one. With the extent of my lymph nodes status i decided against it. I don't know if this effected my reoccurrence scientifically, but frankly in Germany they don't remove breasts since 20 years ¬† And women are living the same as the one who has it.

Therefore of the blood is not treated it would be of no use to treat it locally. Most of the time metastatic breast cancer patient are not candidate for a resection. However, i've seen few who went through ablation and other stuff but very soon after they got new tumors. I know it sounds very tempting when you hear that you can just cut it or burn it, but i would advise to get more than one opinion mainly from an oncologist because he is the best in predicting how the cancer would or may spread. ¬†My MO was against it from the beginning and preferred to do a systematic treatment to treat the whole body. Since the blood is cleansed through the liver the odds is that it could be traveling already somewhere else. I personally do not listen only to surgeons or rad doctor because each one will advise you in his own specialty. I hope this did not deter you and at ¬†the end i am sure you will do what you feel right. I wish you well.¬†",

These are the first rules of safety i was told at my first Dx. I never had an infection during any treatment thank God. Please be very careful with this specially stage IV we are always under treatments therfore our immune system really suffers and sucks . :)",

Xeloda causes diarrhea and its side effects are cumulative not sudden. The symptoms you are having may not all be related specifically to xeloda , you have also two other medicines , it could be a combination of all three. I do not know much about the stent , but i am surprised your onc would consider a blockage before scans and tests. My advise is to wait for your scan and see what it is , instead of worrying yourself. I hope it is not a blockage and that it is simply just a side effect which could betreated with meds . Hugs :)",

Some have them and others don't. As for digestions problems , i had some before diagnosis which seemd more like colon and reflux but nothng else. With chemo now i do have some digestive issues. If you are taking hormones they do disrupt the digestive tract, you just need to watch for excessive symptoms or unusual ones and always inform your onc og any change. I do welcome you here, you will feel comfortable as all the ladies are helpful , loving and kind. I feel there was some neglect in deaing with your case whether medicare, insurance or other and it is a shame. But i do hope now you foundthe right doctor and the right medication, and i hope they will work for you.",

Who knows? You may be able to get back to normal again and be able to take both meds or continue on one. Either alternative is better than nothing. Your doctor is right to be careful and monitor you closely , it would be stupid to die from something else than actually the killer disease, that would be really ironic. Let's hope mine is still norma after two months on these meds. I also took adramaycin and taxotere on my first dx, this is why i am closely monitored also. This time. Unfotunately after my reoccurrence i never saw NED , iT was progression all the way, till my cancer seemed to change direction to he2+ , i was really running out of options. So let's keep praying that all this somehow ends well. I wish both of us fresh aor to breath and a lot of God's presence in our lives. Hugs.",

So i sent ot for an intelligent genomic test in Germany where they performed a CISH test and genetic testing it came back fully HER2 postive and my treatmen worked. I am ILC and ILC is never her2 + except for a very few numbers around the world. But the doctor in germany said the same sample could be depending on how it is sliced both her2- and from the Other positive it is called hetergenous cancer. I hope this helps you.",

But to answer your question if your cancer is the same as the primary ususally it is the same grade but it might undergo some changes such as becoming hormone negative or HER2+ . If you are triple negative to my know ledge chemo is the only way to combat it. Even if your cyberknife is succesful, the tumor is in the liver which means it is circulating in the blood. Therefore, he should use chemo even if the procedure is successful , but if there some cells lurking around chemo should be able to control them. As i see you only had one line of chemo . Telling you he will not use chemo is very strange. I would advise you to seek urgently a second opnion from a good reputed cancer center as soon as possible. As for the insurance i cannot help you since i am not from the US but i am sure one of the ladies here can advise. Good luck on your cyberknife and i hope you get good advise so you can be treated properly.",

I understand you fear and inability to understand all this, it is hard but not undoable. Stage four is rollercaoster ride to all of us. There will be good days and bad ones. Somehow, we learn to live with it. Some are doing just that. You will get to this place , just give yourselves time to let the idea sink in. Being mentally strong is very important as it contributes to your well being and ability to endure. However, i do not see anything wrong with either of you taking Ativan , if you feel you need it. I take stilnox ( ambian) and half a xanax every night since 15 years, i only take them when i want to sleep. I never took at any other time. Some cancer meds will cause insomnia , i am an insmoniac by nature. So if you feel it is helping you , i think you should take it. Frankly addiction is not the problem at this stage. As soon as either of you start treatment, things will get better once you have the plan and know what is being done. It is a hard situation for the both of you soecially when there are children involved. I wish you both good luck on your upcoming treatments hoping they will be successful.",

Some of these chemos we do have less side effects others more. I hope you do no have to go through a lot of them. Somewhere the right combintion is waiting for you.

Also the number of tumors in your liver are not so many to me it feels more clear and manageable more than having more than 10 and having you liver light up like a christmas tree lolllll. I am puzzled why are they doing a biopsy now didn't they biopsy your first tumor? Even though i believe it is good to have a second biopsy , cancer somtimes changes status which may help your doctors a better outlook on how to treat you. My prayers are with you and truly hope you get some peace of mind.",

Thanks for hands and foot advise , i hope ¬†it takes a while before it starts ...i will keep you posted. Some oncs seem to think that if you show HER2 but still negative in FISH , there are some studies which show that it can be effective ...let's wait and see .",

I am sure the fact that you were tired during Kadcyla is due to the fact that you have been on meds for a long time , it takes its tall on a person. I wanted to pm you to tell you that o got my PET results . All tu ors cleraed from both liver and spine and hip. No SUV was found. However TM is 36.5 the normal is 28. But it came down from 50 , to 38.5 , to 36 . I will continue treatment woth taxol till the six months are over then evaluation they may continue to a total of eight months , if status os still the same they will keep hercept/perjeta an anti hormonal . All remains to bee seen. Hugs and prayers are with you and with all the ladies in this board.",

I hope kadcyla gives a long run , i think personally they will keep you on it as long as your body can take it and as long as it is working. I am not HER2+ but i know a lot of ladies who were on it for a long time then it was stopped either because the cancer became resistant to it or because it started to give them heart problem. I met a lady last week who is tnb she was on herceptin for a long while then it stopped working, last month she was put on kadcyla she could not tolerate it and the progression continued , now she was put on carbo gemzar . She has been tnb for 6 years. Only 47 years old. I hope the kadcyla will keep working for you for a long time with less and less SEs. Be well dear Denise and god bless you . :))",

Only your doctors can advise you and even them , cannot put an expiry date on your life. Some people respond even after 4th or fifth treatments . Some people choose to stop and others don't . It is a personal choice. Like the ladies said some have been living for a long while with many and multiple treatments. So cheer up and gear up and get ready to fight your battle , your chances are like all of us , you are not less and we are all surviving with some ups and downs but alive and well.",
