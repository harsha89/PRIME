Got myself checked from 3 different surgeons, U/S was done 2 times but nothing appeared only one surgeon said texture of right breast is comparatively hard after physically examining, anyhow they sent me home saying it is nothing . But 3 months ago I felt a hard lump in my right breast while I was examining it is too much painful I cannot even perform my daily life activities. Two weeks ago a red mark appeared near my right nipple and yesterday a purple dot like mark appeared near red one. Moreover my right axilla swelling has also increased seems like a third breast. I am totally freaking out due to pain and all these symptoms. I don't feel comfortable about the idea to see a doctor because of my past experience none of them took me seriously because I'm only 22.. has anyone been through these symptoms? do these symptoms relate to some kind of hormonal problem?
