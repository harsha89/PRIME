Funny, I used to think I was a very patient person. Good luck on your surgery. It does get better with every passing day. I guess you will be spending Thanksgiving Day in the hospital?",

I just got the pathology report after surgery and it says ER + PR - and doesn't even list the HER2 status at all. It also says grade 1 now. Can you go from a grade 2 down to a 1? The tumor was 1.7 cm. It also said there were microscopic tumor cells in the sentinel node. Is that important? I have been doing some reaseach on the PR negative tumors. Some think it doesn't make a difference in treatments and others think it means chemo is a given. I don't see my onc for another 2 weeks, and if he decides to do the oncotype test, I have a long wait ahead of me for the results. I will go crazy before then wondering if I need chemo or not. Anyone has any ideas on the changing results and whether you think I can expect chemo? Thanks",

Partly from the steroids and partly from nerves. The best news the nurse said I will not be needing the Neulasta shot because my treatment is once every three weeks. She said in that amount of time, your bone marrow has a chance to build back up again. I have been reading that SE's from that can be quite painful, so I was very relieved to hear I won't need it.

That is where I ordered most of mine. I am only on day 8 of my first treatment, so I haven't had to wear them yet. I am dreading that day. I too went out and stocked up on things I would need post chemo, and so far haven't needed any of them. Good luck on your first treatment.",

My wonderful rock of a husband told me I'm beautiful with or without hair. I know he's lying, but hey, I 'll go with it for now. I was hoping that since I had no SE's from my first treatment that maybe miraculously my hair would stay at least through the second treatment. I guess I'm going to have to remove those price tags off the wigs after all. Sigh.",

I had already started reconstruction with an expander. I was supposed to be getting the exchange surgery the last week of January. Now, he says that has to be delayed until May or so. I am so upset and scared. At least we will all have each other to help us through this. I don't know what I would do without these boards.",

However, this morning I woke up with a sore throat and watery eyes. It could just simply be a cold or it could be the beginnings of SE's. I was told to stay away from crowds from day 7 to 10, so I think I will just stick close to home this week just in case. I, too, thought I noticed my scalp tingling a few days ago. It has to be my imagination, right? Ha",

Meaning the tumor had branches like a star projecting off  it. Another website described it as fingers. I went crazy too and spent hours upon hours on researching. Unfortunately, mine turned out to be IDC. Try and stay calm and learn as much as you can. The ladies on this board are a great source of information and will help whenever they can. Good luck!",
