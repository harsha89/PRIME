I will admit that l was addicted to pain medications for years and found relief from the madness of addiction through Suboxone maintenance treatment. Since Suboxone is an opiate receptor blocker my prescriber and surgeon want me to abstain from the Suboxone for three days in order for the suboxone to get out of my system in the event l need an opiate for pain control after my BMX on the 29th. Then l am to resume my Suboxone when l no longer needed an opiate Doing this will put me through terrible withdrawals but l want to follow my doctor's recommendation. While my surgeon has been very supportive today at my pre-op with my PS he was not supportive at all. Initially he told me he would send me home with pain meds. After he left the room his nurse came in and said she was unfamiliar with Suboxone and had educated herself regarding it, talked with the PS, who stated he would not send me home with pain meds. She told me this with her back to me as if l did not warrant a discussion of the matter. I have not cried throughout my testing and diagnosis but l broke down today. I felt so stigmatized. I would not put myself through withdrawals for pain meds related to surgery. I just don't want to hurt and feel like l should be treated like any other patient. Now l have bad feelings toward my PS. IF l was not so close to surgery l would find a more compassionate PS. Part of this post is to vent and l am sorry it is so long. But l do have questions. Is it possible to make it through recovery without pain meds? Had this happened to anyone else?

Since the breast surgeon was very supportive l will call him tomorrow and see what he can and is willing to do. I appreciate all replies as well as no judgment regarding my addiction history. Thank you for your support.",
