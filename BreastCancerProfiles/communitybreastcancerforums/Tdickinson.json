Since they were not able to get all of the DCIS with the lumpectomy, and I have high grade, I decided on the mx. I chose bilateral because I have very dense breasts and have had a biopsy on the right side due to something showing on the MRI. It was benign but I don't want to worry all the time about getting it in the other side, plus, matching sides is important to me. Hoping that after this no other treatment will be necessary and worries should be minimal. I did have the BRCA test done, it was negative and I have no family history of breast cancer but every person on my dads side has had cancer of some type for the last two generations.",

I doubt anyone out here thought it was easy or didn't second guess all their decisions. The only thing you can do is what is best for YOU. Everyone takes different paths and have different reasons for doing so, everyone's cancer is a little different and every one handles theirs different. Once you decide what you are going to do, don't look back and wonder...move on, enjoy life.",
