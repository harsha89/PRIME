    "Content": "ALICIAB wrote: Hello all. I was just diagnosed yesterday and its just so surreal. I am 28 and I found the lump myself one night just scratching and felt something. I had my painful biopsy last week and, as my doctor called and said, \"the results are not good.\" I just feel so young. I don't have any kids. I thought it was smart to wait until I was in my 30, and now I am so plagued by worry that I won't be able to have them. My tumor is .5cm and is a Favor Grade 1. I don't have staging information yet and I don't know if it has spread beyond the lump itself, and I am praying praying praying that it hasn't. I met with the surgeon today and I see the oncologist tomorrow morning. I have small breasts- small A- and so he told me a lumpectomy would leave a considerable dent. I feel so vain for even thinking about being disfigured but I am. I am not married though I am in a long term, live-in relationship, and he is being wonderful. He is wonderful. But, I am also fearful that he will be unattracted to me and not see me as a suitable mate, especially if kids are ruled out. I really hope I can have one. He says it does not change his feelings for me at all and that we will get through this together. In the grand picture, its all silly and not important really. Life is important. I just have to accept that my life is changing big time.   I feel overwhelmed with the decision of doing a lumpectomy, mastectomy or a double. I don't know if I carry the gene yet, as I still have to have all the testing done. If I have it, I may get a double. The idea of not having to deal with it again sounds really nice. But I know many people that have had my same diagnosis and just got the lumpectomy and have had no recurrence. I have to try to not think, but then I have a lot of thinking and planning I have to do in regards to work and if I should apply for state disability and the surgery stuff. I just don't know what to do with myself.   I have to remind myself that I found the lump early (I had had a pap and a breast exam in late Dec. and found the lump mid-March), that its small, and just hope its at Stage1 and that it has not spread, and that I don't have the gene. I know I am hoping/asking for a lot, but can't hurt to ask. I have a hard time staying in the moment and keep having these dramatic scenes playing out in my head of being a boobless barron spinster. I don't indulge those thoughts for long and am trying to keep doing my normal things, but I just feel so weird.   Ok. Sorry for the long post. I talk like I type, randomly and too much. I am just scared and needing a friend who is on the same rickety boat. Dx 5/23/2011, IDC, <1cm, Grade 1 Log in to post a reply",
