I have now also crossed the finish line today!!  6 rounds behind me and NONE more to go!!  Woohooo!!  My mom made brownies, bought an orchid plant, a thank you card, and sparkling cider for the nurses/staff - they loved it.  I did bring an edible arrangement to my treatment that was the Thursday before Christmas and that went over well too. I'm hopeful that with extra hydration the SE's will stay away.  I'm just glad that now my body can start to truly heal itself from the chemo very soon.  I've been reading a little bit about the lupron and how long it takes for a 'normal' cycle to come back and it sounds like it can be several months.  Some people need extra drugs (and a D & C, lovely) to coax it along - never thought I'd be cheering on aunt flo but really would like to not have the stupid hot flashes anymore. As for paraben/aluminum free beuaty products, I've been using one of those crystal deodorants and while I can sometimes notice a little 'natural body odor' I have to stick my nose in my armpit to really notice it.  It's called crystal stick and I found it at my regular grocery store.  It's made of natural mineral salts and looks like quartz crystal.  I've been using it for a few years and like it.  Tom's of Maine are good too, but if I use the long lasting kind it makes my armpits itch.  I do use their toothpaste and like it a lot.   Next up is surgery but I don't know exactly when yet.  I think my onc is going to order new images be done in the next few weeks and then I probably need to call the surgeon for next steps.  Some time after that will be radiation.  I plan on sticking around 'til everybody is done with their treatments and once ckk adds me to the group on fb I'll be there too.   Keep your chins up and kick this crap to the curb.  You can most certainly do it, I know you can!!

I am actually lucky (oozing sarcasm) enough to get not just 4 rounds but 6 - yay for me (not).  My next one is on the 12th and then the FINAL round (can't believe I'm almost there) is on Groundhog Day.  I'm hoping the SE's continue to be at or below the level they've been through these first 4 rounds - keeping fingers crossed. My neuopathy has taken a painful form rather than tingly.  The toe next to my big toe on my left foot has been hurting and the pinky toe on my right has a dark nailbed and is painful.  Sorta like when you wear shoes that you have to cram your toes into, that sort of pain.  They are actually feeling a bit better today, which is good.  To the ladies that used ice on fingers and toes - did you do it while getting treatment or after?  Just curious if I should bring a cooler with me next week :) I had sort of a nasty surprise nosebleed in the car on the way home from work tonight, lovely, huh?  My bloodwork has actually been really good so I'll be interested to see if it's dipped tomorrow.  It's actually been hot the last few days and dry so maybe it's the weather... And I too, take dexamethasone (generic for decadron).  They give me an infusion of it before I get the TC infusions and then I take 8mg once/day for the 3 days after chemo.  It tends to give me indigestion so I take a zantac along with the steroid and problem solved.    Anyway, that's about it for now.  Hope all of you are hanging tough.  My mantra, especially at the beginning of this road, has been 'one day at a time'.  Before you know it, all the treatment days will be behind us and we'll be the ones left standing.  We will.  Heather ",

We are plugging along, aren't we!  I have to share that I really challenged myself yesterday and actually had some success!!  Before dx I was hiking once a week with some friends of mine in a wliderness park in Newport Beach after work.  As the sun started to set earlier we stopped going but then some co-workers of mine have been going on Saturday mornings.  I finally felt up to giving it a shot this week (timing wasn't right for previous hikes) and actually hiked close to 6 miles yesterday!!  Had some lunch afterwards.  And, I volunteer on the weekends at the dalmatian rescue shelter walking dogs so I went over there and did a couple loops afterwards.  My friends, family, co-workers are all pretty surprised how well I've held up through this process and I must admit I've been glad it hasn't been worse.  The phlebitis is a pain, and I'm hoping treatment #5 on Thursday will not have the same result, but really, I know it could be a lot worse. My last treatment is Groundhog Day :) and I can't believe that it's less than a month away now!!!  That should be my last Lupron shot too, which I'll be very glad of saying goodbye to.  Never thought I'd be happy to have aunt flo back lol.   The other thing that continues to remain encouraging is that the chemo seems to really have done it's job shrinking my tumor.  It was roughly golfball sized when we started (didn't feel quite that big to me but from the images that's what they tell me) and now we can't feel it anymore.  Hoping it will make surgery go as smooth as possible.   Hang in there, ladies!!  We're going to get through this very very soon!!  You all ROCK! ",

We are moving right along!!  I wish I had known more about the cold caps when this all started but oh well.  The hair will grow back :) I had my 5th round yesterday and things went better this time than last.  Last time they used a vein in my forearm instead of the in the bend of my elbow and I wound up feeling a burning sensation for a bit.  Then, a few days later I developed a burn mark on my arm and phlebitis in that vein.  Apparently the veins in the bend of your elbow are bigger and not as likely to get the burn (probalby because it's easier for the nurses to seat the IV properly) so we went with one of those this time and things went smoothly.  Hopefully I won't get the phlebitis again, good grief. LeesaAnn - I agree with the other ladies - I'm betting your nose issues are likely from the chemo.  That's been the one side effect that seems to linger the most for me.  I haven't been prone to nosebleeds since I was a kid (I would get them in the winter time when the heat was on and the air was dry - would wake up in the morning a mess) but now with the chemo I blow my nose that first week to week and a half after and I get some blood in the tissue.  My last treatment I actually did get a few bloody noses - my counts have been low but not dangerously so, so they haven't been too concerned. Today I wound up waking up flush pinky red on my chest and face, and a little itchy.  I thought I was having an allergic reaction - I mentioned it to the Onc and that I was going to take benadryl or claritin to relieve it.  He agreed either would be fine but maybe do the claritin since it's non-drowsy.  Well, the claritin didn't clear it up and I happened to be talking to one of my staff and she thinks it's the steriods - they do it to her when she takes them.  Any of you had that SE at all?  It's since subsided, even after taking the oral decadron today, so who knows. All I know is, I'm almost done with this part!!  Just ONE more to go on Groundhog day.  I think several of you are in a similar boat - feels good, doesn't it?   I pulled the trigger on the Komen walk and have already raised $1,030.00 (my cousin gave a very generous donation of $585.00, which helped A LOT).  Walk isn't 'til November so I think I won't have my trouble meeting my goal.  Really excited to do it! Take care of yourselves, ladies - there's light at the end of the tunnel and I promise it's not a high speed train! :) Heather ",

It's been a few days again - work has been nutzo and this weekend was packed in a good way.  I love that there has been excitement about my tattoo/NED idea and love that some creative forces are at work on it.  I actually wrote to a favorite artist of mine (her name is Jen Delyth, she's from Wales and does some amazing Celtic art if you are into that kind of thing) and while she said she doesn't currently have time to do custom stuff it definitely did peak her interest and said if it comes to her she will definitely let me know.  I can't wait to see what your friend has come up with, Erica!!  And, I also think the idea of the heart with NED in the middle, carved into the tree is fantastic.  Btw, I think the shamrock areolas are a fabulous idea!!   I too, am getting ready for my final treatment this week (number 6 on Thursday).  Something that I definitely think has helped me minimize the SE's has been to really ramp up the hydration the few days before, day of, and after treatment.  My mouth tends to go through several phases the week after treatment it was a lot less pronounced this last time and the only thing that changed was the extra water.  Also, for those of you that are having a hard time finding something tolerable to ingest - I have found Starbuck's passion tea lemonade is really good.  I get it sweetened but have also had it without the sweetener (I think the lemonade has some sugar in it already) and it's still good.  The lemon is refreshing and I don't think the passion tea has caffeine in it so that will help with hydration.   Question for you all.  I learned this week that one of the blood tests they do (I get blood checks weekly but this one in particular is monthly) is a tumor marker test (CA 27/29) that measures the protiens in the blood that the cancer tends to give off.  An elevated marker 'can' give an indications of whether the treatments are working or not (read elevated = bad).  Well, not only did I just learn these tests were being done but also learned my marker has been elevated each time the test was done.  The nurse was the one that told me about the test right before she drew my blood.  And, of course, after I got my blood drawn I had to sit in the lobby for 15 mins waiting for the tests to be done on this draw and then wait a little longer to see the doctor (googling it on my phone and worrying - trying not to let my mom know I was worried as she was there with me).  Needlesstosay, I was a bit freaked out.  The doctor explained to me that what often times happens when undergoing treatment is elevated markers (but didn't say why) and then once treatment is finished it goes down.  Have any of you had this test done and have any further information from you oncs?  I'm trying not to worry about it because the doctor doesn't seem concerned and everything else has been going well but good grief. On a happier note, I had a very full day today.  Started at 7 am for a kickoff breakfast with my Komen team - really great group of women (and one guy, he's been doing this for 10 years - he's actually the team lead) - some are survivors, others have family/friends affected.  Really nice to have another group of people that can directly relate to this struggle.  Wish all of us could meet weekly in person too!!! Btw, I fully intend to stay attached to this board 'til we are all through this process - and rads too as I'll be going through that but not for a few months - I have surgery next (and am still nervous about it).  I want to make sure each of us navigates this dark path in the woods and comes to the clearing safely. After breakfast my friend and I went to see Wicked - if you haven't seen it please see it!!  It's wonderful!!  I actually read the book when it first came out (15-20 years ago?) and LOVED it.  The Wizard of Oz is my all time favorite movie and love when authors take a different view on an old story.  Teared up quite a few times watching - I  could really relate to Elphaba (i.e.Wicked Witch of the West) currently - feel like the 'odd' one with this cancer thing where people feel sorry for you, or chat about your lack of hair in whispers, etc.  She rises above the ignorance tho and makes some great friends in the process.  Perhaps NED is a little green witch :).   To all of you having your last treatment this week - this is that point in the race where you can SEE the finish line, when your strength seems like it's completely sapped, but when you see that finish line, you find what runners call your 'kick' and you find this previously unknown source of strength and you run and run like you've never run before, and you cross that finish line CHEST FIRST, arms high in the air.  YOU CAN DO THIS!!!  I KNOW YOU CAN!!!  AND YOU WILL...BE...VICTORIOUS!!! For those of you at the halfway mark that the outside world wants to high 5 - I know so well how it seems like the end is so far away.  I have been jealous of some of you that were halfway at treatment 2 to be honest but also glad that you wouldn't have to endure the extra treatments too.  Just remember to take it one day at a time - that's all we can do - that's all we should expect from ourselves (and what the outside should expect from us) and before you know it you will have that finish line in sight.  And you will find your kick.  And YOU will most certainly be VICTORIOUS too!!! Continue taking care of yourselves, ladies.  I keep all of you in my thoughts always - for the Komen walk I'm going to make a shirt with a list of the names on it of the people I'm walking for - I'm adding the whole discussion board as a group to it.  I walk for you.  And will continue to walk 'til a cure is found.

So sorry some of you have gotten colds/strep during this process - definitely sucks having to delay treatments because of it.  I had to delay treatment for one week because otherwise I would've gone right before Thanksgiving (my treatment should've been on turkey day actually) - was sort of nice to feel more normal for an added week tho.   Dumb question - what are cold caps and what do you use them for? Kimdy - I am on a 6 treatment regimen and have completed 4 so far.  I'm going in for #5 on Thursday.  And, other than developing phlebitis my SE's are similar to yours - I feel extremely fortunate.   LeesaAnn - Really sorry you have a bad reaction to the taxotere but glad they've figured out a good 'cocktail' to give you to prevent it.  By the time they are about to administer the chemo drugs I'm pretty loopy too (it's the benadryl and atavan) and so I wind up just sleeping through most of the chemo infusion.  At my first treatment I remember turning my head quickly after the benadryl/atavan and it was like my vision was delayed a half second behind my face turning , was very odd - mostly because I've never done recreational drugs in my life (I drink but have never smoked or done any other drugs) and can only imagine that's what it sort of feels like.   Heatherb8 - I am keeping fingers and toes crossed for you on the greyhound adoption.  This year has been challenging for me in a few ways.  In July I had to say goodbye to my sweet dalmatian, her name was Ashes - I had her since she was 9 weeks old and when she died she was just shy of 14 years.  It was really hard for me because she's the closest thing I've ever had to having a child.  While I wasn't ready to 'fill the void' right away I decided to volunteer at the dalmatian rescue near my home.  I saw it as an opportunity to help me heal from my loss, help make some very deserving doggies happy, and hopefully bond with a few of them so that I could give them a forever home.  In October, not quite a month after diagnosis, and a week after my first treatment, I brought two sweet boys home with me, and am so very thankful they are in my life, especially now.  I almost feel like my Ashes knew I was about to face such a huge challenge and made her exit before so I could concentrate on taking care of me.  At the end of her life I was carrying her everywhere (had to carry her outside to potty, handfeed her, etc) so it was time for her to go.  Having my rescue dogs (names are Mickey and Romeo) in my life has definitely provided me a very bright spot in my heart - that unconditional love is like a magic pill for sure. Theresa - Thank you so much for joining our discussion!!  It is very uplifting to hear from someone that has weathered this storm ahead of us.  Your view on staying positive but having knowledge of the bad stuff is important, but not dwelling on it of course.  Be armed but not neurotic, right?    Anyway!!  Another novel - I'm really not a chatty cathy normally - I suppose I just wait 'til I have something to say and then look out!   Take care of yourselves, ladies - you ARE strong, you ARE winning this war.   Heather ",

On the chemo front, I've definitely started getting some sensitivity in my hands and toes - I'm going to mention it to my onc on Thursday when I get my blood drawn again (I've been getting mine drawn pretty much weekly, not sure why since my counts have been really good each time, need to ask about that too I suppose) as far as what to do to help alleviate it.  I feel fortunate that my bone pain has been minimal, then again I'm only getting one shot after each treatment where it sounds like some of you are getting mutiple shots after each round?  And it's bizarre that the claritin works for pain, who knew?  I also feel fortunate that I haven't felt all that tired - today I did after walking 8 dogs but it was also 80 degrees here today so I think the warm weather didn't help :).  I too suffer from restless sleep - I've found taking a motrin PM and a regular motrin (total of 400 mg) usually does help but I try not to do it every night.  I managed to take a nap today after dog walking which was nice.  I think it would be great to all meet up if we can figure out the logisitics.  I intend to really celebrate big once this is over - I'll be turning 40 at the end of May and I should have all treatment behind me at that point - definitely worth a big party I'd say! We rang in the new year playing poker and I managed to actually win this time!  I hope that's an indication of how this year is going to go.  I'm going to have faith that it will! Fight the good fight! Heather ",

      "Content": "Dec 30, 2011 01:41PM heatherweather wrote: Hi ladies! I'm a little late joining a discussion board but figured better late than never!  I'm on a 6 round regimen, once every 3 weeks and just had my 4th round last Thursday.  My experience has been like many of you - it's doable, not a walk in the park, but not debilatating either.  I've generally only taken the day of treatment off from work (I missed one day after my first treatment because I had been up all night on the toilet) but otherwise have reported to work regularly. My oncology team has been great - definitely taken good care of me through this process.  One thing I think was super helpful - the nurse on my first treatment day gave me a list of the drugs that would be administered, in the order administered, and why they were giving them to me.  I'll share that with you now: 1st infusion of emend (long acting anto-nausea med), 2nd infusion of zantac (counteracts the stomach irritation from steroid), 3rd infusion of decadron (steroid for anti-nausea as well as assisting in fluid excretion), then 3 shots directly into IV - first benadryl (because the taxotere can cause allergic reactions), then aloxi (another anti-nausea med), then ativan (anti-nausea and anti-anxiety).  Once all of that is in my system I'm pretty groggy (benadryl and ativan have that effect :)) and they are ready to start the actual chemo.  Taxotere first for 2 hour infusion and then cytoxan for 1 hour infusion.  Lastly, they do a 30 minute saline flush. I usually sleep through the actual chemo infusion, which is nice.  And, because of all the anti-nausea meds I haven't had any nausea - I've had some indigestion that OTC zantac has worked on but other than that, no nausea.  I'm not required to take any drugs pre-treatment day but I do take oral decadron for the 3 days after.  I've learned taking a zantac with the decadron will prevent the indigestion, btw. In addition to the above regimen I am also getting Lupron shots - I'm 39 years old and do not have any children.  The Lupron is supposed to have a protective effect on my ovaries that in the event I want to have kids one day I'll have a better chance of coming out the other side still fertile.  What to know about Lupron - it basically puts you into menopause temporarily, so expect hot flashes.  Kinda cool tho is that aunt flo dissappears while you are on it so that's one less thing to deal with! Neulasta shots - I get them the day after treatment each time.  It was never described to me as an option, I sort of assumed it was necessary.  I do experience bone pain (1st treatment was the most noticable) but I've managed it with motrin.  Day of treatment, am pretty groggy for the remainder of the day so usually don't plan to do much.  The week after treatment is when I notice side effects the most.  Nose gets irritated and feels congested - I've been applying a saline nasal gel and neosporin and it helps a bit.  I've had intestinal challenges - not really so much constipation (I do try to keep as hydrated as possible so that may be why no constipation) but I get loose/crampy bowels on and off the week after treatment.  Fatty foods only make that worse so stay away from them.  And, spicy foods - I usually enjoy kung pao chicken and the week after one of my treatments I tried to eat it and my mouth was on fire!!  Haven't had actual mouth sores but have had a sore/sensitive mouth.  Nail beds have been a bit sensitive and have just noticed recently that I have some ridges near the cuticle.  Hoping I don't lose the nails.  The last 2 treatments have caused phlebitis (inflammed vein) where the treatments were administered and the treatment for that is warm moist compresses.  I found a reusable moist heat pad at Rite Aid that you can heat in the microwave, definitely helps. The hair loss was what I was worried about the most at the beginning of this process - I wound up preemptively cutting it short and saving the hair to make a halo.  Once it started to fall out my boyfriend, who happens to be bald, gave me a buzz cut.  Then when it was really looking rediculous we shaved it to the skin.  Hair loss started about 2 weeks after first treatment.  I haven't shaved my head since we took it down to the skin and I have what I'd call peach fuzz that is about a half inch long right now.  I wear a wig to work (I have the halo of my own hair and another human hair wig that I usually wear) and then when not at work I wear hats.  I've discovered I have a nicely shaped head :).  Just need to be patient with the process and know that eventually the hair comes back.  Fortunately, so far, I haven't lost eyelashes or eyebrows - hopefully I'll get through this without losing them. Well, ladies, that's pretty much a novel so I'll stop for now.  You are all doing great - for those of you not yet baptized by the chemo, try not to worry too much about it, it's not as bad as you think it will be.  You are NOT alone here either.  Take care of yourselves and FIGHT ON!!

Stay strong, ladies!!  We'll beat the crap out of this thing!!! Heather ",

Managed to get over to the shelter yesterday and walk some doggies again - I'm planning to go today too but am still sitting on the couch :).  Actually went out and saw our friends' band play last night - haven't been out to do that in a long while.  They were super appreciative that we made the trek and it was nice to do that again (I used to spend many a weekend doing just that - great people watching!). ckk - I am still trying to get my arms around all the details but from what I read on the Komen website it sounds as though each person on a team has to raise the required minimum and once a donation is made to one team member it can't be transferred to another.  Seems silly, really, but maybe there is a method to the madness.  I figure starting this early on it I should at least hit the required mimimum ($2,300) and hopefully my goad of $5,000.  So many people are touched in one way or another by this monster that I'm keeping fingers crossed I won't have to resort to begging lol. I'm trying to be more proactive about getting ahead of my SE's this time in that I finally invested in a humidifier, am applying aquafor to my hands and putting on cotton gloves each night to wear while I sleep, rinsing with biotene when I brush, and shooting the saline stuff up my nose.  I'm only day 3 after round 5 but things seem pretty good (mouth is a little sore but not too bad).   LeesaAnn - hope you are feeling better!  heatherb8 - yay for the doggie!!  You'll do just fine with the in-home visit - having the doggie there will give you a natural energy boost so the shelter is comfortable you and your family will provide the perfect home for the pup.   Enjoy your days, ladies!!!

I've been a bit quiet again but have really enjoyed reading everyone's posts.  Love the story about the book - it's funny the serendipity of life when stuff like this happens.  I wound up reconnecting with a childhood friend of mine on facebook shortly after diagnosis and found out he works for a company that makes chemo drugs :).  Also, a few weeks ago, was feeling pretty down one day at work.  Went to lunch (by myself, as I often do) and as I was finishing up the man at the table next to me told the waiter he was going to buy my lunch for me, truly made my day.   I wasn't as lucky as some of you when I got 'the call'.  The whole process was a bit ridiculous really, as I had actually found the mass myself and my gynecologist initially blew it off - I think I knew in my heart of hearts that it wasn't good but rationalized a false sense of security for about 3 months based on his 'assessment' that it was just fluid build up.  Anyway, once I finally got the biopsy done on September 29th it was Friday, September 30th that I received the call at my desk at work from my gynecologist.  Needlesstosay I left for the rest of the day.  I spent the following week a bit lost - the only good thing the gynecologist did was refer me to a good surgeon.     I'm a little worried about my finger nails.  They are looking pretty bizarre at this point.  They are all rippled and I'm seeing what I'd call bubbles in some of them.  I'm hoping I don't lose any of them.  They all seem to be pretty securely attached to the nail bed, so we'll see.  My eyebrows/lashes are still there, I think they are a little thinner but still look normal.  I also have heard people lose them after treatment.  There is a doctor that offers free latisse to chemo patients that are 3 months out from their chemo.  Not sure whether I'll take advantage of it because I have green eyes and I understand it can permanently change your eye color to brown.  May need to start learning to stencil my brows if they come out :) The really good news is I too only have 1 more treatment to go and if all goes as planned it will be on groundhog day :).  Can't believe I have 5 behind me.  I feel very fortunate that my SE's have been pretty tolerable - I feel so bad for all of you that have dealt with more severe SE's.  You have all been so strong tho, in so very many ways, lesser folks wouldn't be able to hang.  No way. Thank you all for being such a great support group.  I really do hope we can all meet up when we have this behind us.   Keep your chins up, ladies!!  Did any of you ever see West Side Story?  My English teacher in junior high was a big fan and when we graduated from 8th grade he whispered to each of us, \"Walk tall, you're Jets!\" from the movie/musical.  I think that's appropriate here - walk tall, you are SURVIVORS!!!!

Been several days again, but have read all the posts since my last visit.  Josie, thank you so much for the www.headcovers.com recommendation - I will definitely keep in mind should things deteriorate with my eyebrows.  Heatherb, I LOVE Nitro!!  So awesome you have him in your home now - I tell my two dalmatian boys everyday how much I love them and that I'm glad they are with me.  You never have to worry about them telling you you're half way through now! :)  Rachel, so glad you had a happy bday - and you kick ass to have played for Pirates - I really miss playing sax and piano, I was fortunate to play in the pit for several musicals in high school.  I went to the NAMM convention this past weekend and that always makes me want to pick it up again.  Definitely need to look into that!! My dad is crazy with forwarding me email jokes and stuff on a daily basis (he's relatively recently retired so has a lot more time on his hands).  He forwarded me this today and just thought it would be nice to share with the group.  Thought it was kinda fun: www.flixxy.com/jive-aces-bring...  Also, my dad's donation to my Komen walk this November pushed me over my required minimum of $2,300!!!  Now I don't have to worry about having enough funds to participate - I'm hoping to get to $5K and since I've got quite a bit of time I don't think I'll have a problem with it.   As far as imaging is concerned, before I even started chemo I had a total of 3 ultrasounds, an MRI of both breasts, mammogram of both breasts, and a PET scan (and I too have dense breasts).  I did hear from one doctor that depending on where you are in your menstrual cycle the MRI can light up like a Christmas tree.  Fortunately, all images taken showed no evidence of the cancer anywhere but the tumor itself.  My onc told me after my last chemo he'll be ordering another MRI - not sure if the BS will order any additional scans before my surgery - I may give him a call this week to see when I need to visit with him next.  All I know is I'll be super happy to get my 6th, and FINAL, treatment out of the way on Feb 2.  I'm going to add my treatment days to my signature too - really good idea! I hope that video brightened your days a bit.  For those of you in the 'pit' right now - this is DEFINITELY your safe place to scream, cry, swear, punch a wall, whatever.  I too seem to be emotionally up and down through this process - on top of the chemo regimen I have lupron in my system too, putting my ovaries asleep, so I'm sure that only adds fuel to the emotional fire.  And I think I get a touch of roid rage those 3 days after my treatment - I've never had patience in the car but holy crap look out on those days lol. Fingernails are still hanging on - I asked my onc about the cold caps and icing fingertips during treatment and he said it doesn't work.  I'm glad to hear the cold caps have worked for some of you - wish I had known about them.  But, I figure my bald head is my temporary battle scar for now.  It's good to know I have a nicely shaped head anyway :).   And, I'm considering getting a tattoo when I'm on the other side of treatment.  I'm thinking of a tree (since the taxotere comes from the yew tree), the rune for the yew tree, and an ouroboros (snake eating its tail - symbol of eternal life/rebirth).  I'm also considering adding an Ernest Hemingway quote, \"The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.\".  Also, may add NED (no evidence of disease) - seems like NED should be a little dude but can't imagine what he'd look like.  Have no idea how to compose all those symbols into a unifed image yet but that's what I'm tossing around.  I don't currently have any tattoos but going through this battle seems worthy of marking.  I may chicken out and just get a third ear piercing and wear an earring with a pink stone.  Can I just tell you, I've never been a fan of pink, and I now have more pink stuff than I would ever want?  Is that bad?  I'm really much more a purple gal :) Alright, I think that's enough for now.  Keep on boxing that cancer biatch, ladies!!  It's nearly down for the count now...and soon you will rise up victorious!!!

Heatherb8 - yes, you do wet the crystal to use it.  I usually just quickly pass it under the running faucet so it's not drenched and then I lean over the sink when I rub it on.  As long as the thing isn't dripping with water you should be fine. GracieG - not a stupid question at all.  I actually wasn't sure what the answer was either but it appears as though parabens can mimic the hormone estrogen - so for those of you that have hormone receptor positive cancers, particularly ER+, it would seem as though it would be best to avoid.   Other than that, I think I'm going to wash my wig, eat something, and then head to bed.  The benadryl and ativan keep me groggy all day (I get some noticable dark circles around my eyes I've noticed on treatment day, how lovely) so I think I'll sleep ok tonight.  My mom got me some breathe right strips to try and alleviate the nasal congestion too - I'll let you know if it works.   Have a fantastic night, ladies!!  Almost the weekend!!  Yay!!
