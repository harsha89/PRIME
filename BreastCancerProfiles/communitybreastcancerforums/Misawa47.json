I do hope you go back to the BS and get an MRI at the least. You don't want to ignore this, especially since it has grown over the past 2 months. don't let this arrogant doctor throw you off track. You are your own advocate for your health. My prayers are with you. Bernice",

All flights go out of the Narita Airport in Tokyo which means I have to either fly or take the bullet train which costs $250/each way then the airline ticket is the same to Okinawa or Hawaii. I am going on a business trip to Okinawa in April so could see about seeing a doctor while I am there. Actually the doctor I saw here about the mass ordered an x-ray for me; however, I don't believe the bone itself has changed and that is all the x-ray will see is the bone. The Radiology department agreed that an x-ray will not see tissue. I was actually hoping for a ct scan. How are you doing? Bernice",

For MRI's, catscans, etc., I have to visit other facilties and pay the travel/hotel expense out-of-pocket. I pay 25% for actual medical treatment. Thanks again everyone!",

I had to fly to Atlanta GA in Aug 08 for a stereotactic biopsy; however, the Dr missed the spot. I, then, had to fly to Hawaii in Nov 08 for another stereotactic biopsy. Came back b9; however, the Oncologist reading the report wanted me to have an MRI done due to my family history of ovarian cancer (mom and sister). I found out the end of Dec that there was a 6mm mass in the RIGHT breast! The doctor strongly recommended an ultrasound and a biopsy. It is extremely expensive for me to travel for these medical procedures and it is all out of pocket. I am retired military but they don't cover travel, food and lodging, only free medical.  I have also read about the many false positives from an MRI so elected to wait 6 months then fly back to Hawaii for another MRI for changes. The Oncologist from Hawaii called my office last Wednesday, 14 Jan, urgently telling me to get the ultrasound \"just to be safe\" ASAP. I didn't know doctors makes those calls to patients long distance, and does he know something more than I know? I am so paranoid and scared. I spoke to the medical facility here (Northern Japan) and after my films arrive back here in Japan, they will schedule me for an ultrasound and even if they find something they don't have the equipment or the expertise to perform a biopsy. My concern is that I have very dense breast so what if it doesn't show up and I get a false negative from the ultrasound?  If you are able to get the biopsy,  I would definitely do it based on the stories I have read from other women. Mine is a financial reason to hold off.",

I get free medical at a military base; however, I have to pay out of pocket for travel and hotel expenses to get to these places. Of course Tri-Care covered part of the expense to see the Emory Cancer Institute in Atlanta; however, I still had to pay air fare and hotel.  Great news...my biposy results were benign. I had such a horrible stereotactic biopsy in Atlanta where they weren't able to numb me and they were still able to get 12 samples with me in excruciating pain.  I vowed I would never have another stereotactic biopsy done; however, when I learned they missed the spot, my doctor here at Misawa insisted I go to Hawaii for ANOTHER stereotactic. I was a nervous wreck. Of course, I could have seen a doctor locally with a referral; however, I would have to pay a percentage where if I went to a military hospital I didn't have to pay anything so I elected to to to Trippler Army Medical Hospital in Hawaii. I took a Xantax prior to the procedure as I was so concerned they wouldn't be able to numb me as before. They gave me 10cc of lidocaine and I didn't feel a thing! This was done on a Friday (21 Nov) and I went for the results on the following Wednesday. The doctor then examined me and felt 2 lumps in the other breast (right) that they were concerned with so insisted that I have an MRI before heading back to Misawa. The doctor that performed the biopsy did an Ultrasound on the lumps but didn't see anything to be concerned with. However, the second doctor said a mammogram AND an ultrasound can miss a lot. Due to Thanksgiving, I wasn't able to get in until the following Monday (1 Dec) and they MRI'd both breasts to \"make sure\". I understand it will take about a week for the pictures to be reviewed.  The doctors/staff at Trippler were amazing. They were very knowledgeable and spent a great deal of time explaining to me every step. I actually was able to get a room at Trippler Lodging; however, it was so far from the city and there were no eating establishments within walking distance that I ended up moving to the Hale Koa Hotel. Fumi, thanks so much for your information. I have been inquiring about specialist in Japan but was told there are no cancer specialist in Japan. This was from my surgeon here at Misawa! I will keep this information and pass it on to other people here at Misawa and for myself if needed in the future. I heard the past wing commander's wife that just left here this past summer, was just diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. So sad. She just had a baby and has other small children. Vicky, I agree with you, it would be nice to have a site dedicated to give people information in their area about clinics/specialists, etc. I can't believe you are getting \"ignored\" on your symptoms. It sounds really serious. You know your body best and I would be persistent with getting an MRI. My mother has cancer for the 3rd time now. The first time was stomach cancer and they kept telling her it was nothing. She knows her body so well so went to another doctor insisting that something is not right. That is when they found the stomach cancer. She then got ovarian cancer and now fighting cancer for a 3rd time in her stomach area. You are right that if there is something, they key is to catch it early. I will keep you in my prayers. God Bless all, Bernice",

My question is if I do nothing and they do another MRI in 6 months, if it is something would it have gotten larger? I have heard of so many stories of ladies preparing for the MRI or Ultrasound-guided biopsy's only for the doctor to send them home as the tumor \"disappeared\". I also know MRI's provide many false-positives so would rather \"wait and see\"; however, if it is something I am scared that my waiting may jeopardize my health. Bernice",
