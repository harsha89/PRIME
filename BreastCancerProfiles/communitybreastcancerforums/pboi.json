After rads, I started to taper, about 1/4 mg every week or two. I used a nail file to cut a tiny bit more every night. When I got to 1/4 mg stopped cold turkey and used Benadryl for about a week or two. I have insomnia I believe from my instant menopause or maybe the AI and knew I couldn't stay on the Benadryl long term so I tried melatonin with pretty good success, sleeping better. I'm not able to get enough hours of sleep with the melatonin so am now on Trazadone which works great for me. I have 3 young kids and I understand your frustration trying to get off the Ativan, take care of them,and still sleep. Please feel free to PM me with questions.

I spent 5 hours at the chemo center today and then picked up my 3 kids from school, shuttling to practices, getting homework done, and dinner and dishes. I think my husband thinks chemo is a breeze because I've been lucky to have little side effects, and continue to do much of what I did before. But even with little chemo side effects, I'm not the same physically and emotionally. He doesn't quite get it. Only a handful of friends know about my Stage 4 diagnosis, for a few reasons. For the most part I amchoosing not to tell people at this point. It's been 3 months since my mets diagnosis, and it's hard for me to talk about it to others, I'm having a hard time accepting that this really happening, but I'm slowly getting there. With my first diagnosis, it felt like everyone knew. Some avoided me because I made them uncomfortable and they just didn't know what to say. I really found out then who my friends were. I was very active at my kids school, and my kids have asked that I notdisclose my diagnosis there. The last time I went through this they had to field a lot of questions from well-meaning teachers, friends, and parents. They don't want to have to do that now, especially not knowing what to say about my having a mets diagnosis. They see enough of what I go through with cancer at home, so I don't want them to have to think about it when they are at school too.",

I happened to notice you taking Benedryl as a premed for Taxol.

I'm 46 and married with a 10 year old son and twin 13 year old daughters. I was diagnosed with Stage 2A in 2014 and had a BMX, chemo, radiation, and after that did 3 years of Arimidex and Zometa every 6 months for osteoporosis. In early August this year, felt fullness in my right quadrant and bloating. CT discovered widespread mets in my liver, largest measuring 13x8x16cm. The size of this mass freaks me out, as I have not seen anyone on these boards with anything this large! I feel no pain, but do feel the mass under my ribs as you described. So you are not alone in that. A radiologist told me masses this size can go undetected because there is a lot of space under the ribs in the intestinal area that it can grow in. I never noticed the mass until after diagnosis. I started Gemzar/Taxol at the beginning of September. I also sought a 2nd opinion with a MO at Stanford. She thought Gemzar/Taxol might be too aggressive and suggested weekly Taxotere, but was ok if I wanted to go with the more aggressive Gemzar/Taxol, which I did choose to do. It's been 6 weeks now and a repeat CT shows no progression in any lesions, and a slight decrease in largest lesion 11x7x14cm. Im disappointed that there wasn't more shrinkage but my MOs tell me that no progression/stable and some shrinkage is good news. My liver enzymes which were elevated, are trending down now. So I continue with the Gemzar/Taxol for 3 more cycles. Positive thoughts for you for a good scan next week, hoping you get great results. I have never felt such fear in my life...and the sheer size of my mass is so scary. Thank you for posting...I hate that you are going through this nightmare too...but now I don't feel so alone. PB ",

Bubblebeard...I'm amazed that if you get shrinkage that you can move to the anti-hormonals already, that's great. Both of my MOs have mentioned a possibility of anti-hormonals in the future, but not until my large tumor shrinks by a lot. Their plan for me if the next scan continues to be positive is to drop the Gemzar and continue with the Taxol. PB",

I would love nothing more than to get off chemo now, but honestly would be a bit scared to go to the anti-hormonals. So I'm very curious to hear what your 2nd opinion MO says. Just curious...because I'm seeing you have resolving bone mets, are you on any bone strengthening drugs like Zometa or Xgeva or something like that? I was put on Arimidex after treatment was done a few years back, and had a dexa scan which revealed I had osteoporosis even before the Arimidex started, so was put on Zometa and have been on that for 3 years now. I was a bit puzzled when I developed the massive liver mets that I didn't have any bone mets, and my 2nd opinion MO suspects that the Zometa may have possibly protected my bones. Just something to think about if you're not on something already. Both of my MOs don't believe Y90 is an option for me due to the large tumor size. Though I'm still interested in this as an option down the road. I was enlightened to read a previous poster mention maybe its not an option because its not offered at my facility. That never occurred to me. But still...something I want to pursue. PB",

There was a whole bunch of different mutations they test for. The results took about 2-3 weeks to come in. I only tested positive for the FGFR1 amplification. My facility used Strata testing, which is similar to the Foundation One testing that I think is frequently used. My MO uses the results to enter into some database to see what treatments or clinical trials might work out for me. PB",

      "Content": "Dec 2, 2015 07:44PM - edited Dec 2, 2015 07:45PM by pboi If you do OS I don't know what impact it will have on your ovaries. I did do OS for 4 months before my oophorectomy. I couldn't have surgery right away and wanted to start the AI. I didn't like getting the Lupron shot, I didn't feel right after each shot and got very bloated and fatigued. So it's possible to have side effects. Plus it was a pain to go in monthly for my shots. I don't believe OS protects you from ovarian cancer, I think it just stops the ovaries from functioning. This is why I had the oophorectomy as soon as I could, to eliminate the possibility of ovarian cancer. You can definitely try the OS first and see how you do with the menopausal symptoms and then do the oophorectomy later, if you choose to. PB",
