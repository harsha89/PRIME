Anyone out there that had to continue to go back every six months, for several years, that once finally biop, it was cancer?  Do they normally do an exc. type Biop?  It seems to me, from all of my resears on various boards, that even if several years elapse, the diagnosis is usually cancer.  I have been followed now for 2 years, and still have to go back in Nov, I just had a mamo in May.  Can I demand a biopsy?  I am tired of this???  Please advise.  Also, my mother had BC in her late 50's.  I am 50, and have a gut feeling that is not good.

I really appreciate any and all replys!!!",
