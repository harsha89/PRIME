I leave yellowish greenish slime on everything, my DH says he thinks it is the Silvadene mixed with old skin, I think it almost looks like an infection. Does anyone else have this? And how am I supposed to get this Silvadene off for rads, no way can I directly wash this area, rinsing is bad enough but it has the consistancy of lard! I am so disapointed I really thought that rads would be so easy, but I am in so much pain and no matter what I do to improve my skin it is just getting worse.",

RO told me not to wear a tight bra, well I only own tight bras and having boobs as big as mine I have never experienced a \"loose\" bra??? My RO gave me a cream called Biafine to put on 3 times a day which I've been doing since day 1 with no results. Today I looked for 100% aloe at Walgreens, none found, I bought some aloe burn gel that has some lidacaine in it for pain I guess??? Do I keep the boob lubed with cream or dry underneath??? Thought of trying a maxipad underneath to keep cream on boob but sweat off??? I am VERY confused. Any suggestions?

I am 16 weeks PFC and my hair is growing in the opposite of yours thick on sides and back, thin on top, I still wear a baseball cap everywhere I go. I hear alot of people that say their hair is thinner on one side than the other; I am convinced it has alot to do with sleeping one side more than the other, remember when our kids were babies my daughter had hardley any hair on the sides from laying down and rolling around from side to side. My husband also thinks my hair is good enough to go out without a hat, but oh well it's not good enough for me yet! You will know when it's time and that will be when \"you\" are comfortable!",

I'm sorry you are going through this, I know how you feel my mom was diagnosed at age 49 and I was diagnosed with BC at age 39. Hopefully it is nothing, maybe an infection of some kind. Go ahead and get to the Dr. and put your mind at ease. {{{HUGS}}} Donna",

She was diagnosed with BC in August of 1998, 11/11 positive nodes. She had a radical mastectomy followed by high dose chemo and what she called stem cell rescue, maybe a BMT? She lived cancer free until November 2004 when she was diagnosed with a large met to the brain, this was also removed, shortly after this she was diagnosed with Acute Myloid Leukemia from all the BC treatments. When I was diagnosed with my BC almost 2 months ago and talked to my Oncologist for the first time she said \"wow, they very rarely do that treatment anymore\". What a difference 10 years makes. Anyway, when I saw your group I thought wow my mom would have for sure been a member, lol. She was a ICU nurse for over 25 years and also had alot of co-workers diagnosed. Although she never questioned enviromental factors in her work place, I always have. Anyway, your group just made me think of her so I thought I would say hi and best wished to you all!!",
