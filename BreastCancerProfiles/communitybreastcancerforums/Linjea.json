      "Content": "Linjea wrote: What is the right way to do lymph drainage massage on your arm? I have conflicting information and am not sure what is the best technique to use. How long should I spend doing the massage? Also, I can get my hand down to normal size and appearance although when I get up in the morning within 1/2 hour the blood vessels in that hand and wrist are swollen. My index finger and my hand tends to swell at times and my hand and fingers have gotten to the point of having no knuckles or bones showing - just a big fat ball - but so far have been able to get it down. I am concerned about my forearm. There really isn't a measurable difference in size anymore from my other arm, but there is a visible difference. When I hold my arms up against my chest there is an indentation that runs down my forearm in my good arm but none at all in the lymphatic arm and the arm aches with a burning kind of feeling and feels different to the touch. I am wondering if I should be wrapping that arm at night or what. I have read here that there can be an increase in fluid in the arm of about 30% without any evidence of measurement increase. I have never been shown or told anything about wrapping except what I have read on this site but am thinking that there is still fluid built up in that arm. Am still waiting for a new sleeve the fitter ordered. Very discouraged in that area. The old sleeve is wearing out. My arm gets really burny achy wearing it after a bit. The old glove causes my fingers to look like I have spent hours in the tub. They have deep indentations all down the fingers that match the fabric in the gloves and are squished looking when I take my glove off. The indentations are still there the next morning and never go away because I put my glove back on in the morning. I don't think my gloves should do that but the measurements for the gloves seem ok. I have ordered a sleeve and gauntlet from the Lymphedivas internet site and I loved it but my index finger swole a bit. The sleeve was a bit tight in the forearm but so very comfortable otherwise - the measurements for the size small I got were good except for the forearm. I returned the sleeve and am waiting for the next bigger size to come to try that. In that one the wrist measurement is a bit too large but will try it and see if the finger issue is better. Worth a try, I think. I may not be able to get away with the gauntlet. The saga never ends. I want some brownies! Hugs to all, Linjea Log in to post a reply",

The massage therapist is Vodder trained - gave instructions and showed me the shorter routine which only massages the neck on both sides, lymphatic arm and chest on affected side. She has done massage on my arm twice now.  I cannot see any difference in measurements using either method. My forearm ranges from 1 to 1.5 cm larger than my other arm. I don't know if I need to be wrapping my arm at night - no one has shown me how - or if I should be wearing a night sleeve or just to keep elevating it at night. Nothing seems to reduce it more. It is as far as I can get it down now. Lots of burning aching feeling in the arm often. The fitter is difficult to talk with and is the one who took my measurements over my armsleeve. Still waiting for the reorder of the sleeve to arrive. The one she got has a gauntlet without thumb and made my thumb and index finger swell right away. She sent for another made to measure with a thumb in it but it does not come with fingers. She likes the sleeves to be really tight and really firm. I get discouraged even thinking about it. Thank you for your awesome site. There is so much information here and support. Blessings and hugs, Linjea",

      "Content": "Oct 24, 2010 09:06AM - edited Oct 24, 2010 09:09AM by Linjea Thanks Binney. My physiotherapist gave me a sheet showing lymph drainage that says to start by massaging the neck, then the armpit of the good arm, then that side of the chest to that armpit, then the rest of the chest to the side already done, the shoulder of the bad arm to the neck, the upper arm to the neck, the upper forearm to the upper arm, the lower forearm to the  the upper forearm, the hand to the lower forearm, then the full arm to the neck, then side of the chest on the lymphatic side to the good side to the armpit area. There are to be 10 strokes on each area and it takes 30 minutes or more to do. The arm is massaged on the outer arm. She said I could also massage the under side of my arm in the same way if I want to. Then my Vodder trained massage therapist informed me that I should clear the neck, then the upper outer arm to the neck, then the full arm to the neck, then the hand and full arm to the neck, then the underside of the arm to the outer side of the arm in each area, then stroke accross the base of the neck from the bad side to the good and I was done. This is using just a few strokes on each area. Much faster but don't know if it is as effective so not sure which to do. What do you all do? ",
