Maybe I'm just losing my mind on top of everything else! I intend to keep up with this site, as there's so much collective wisdom here.",

Have had tiny non-palpable fibroadenoma on right which has been stable for years (removal never recommended). This year's mamm showed new nodule on right, so had additional views and an u/s. Breast doc and radiologist leaned towards possible new fibro but said imaging wasn't as clear cut as last time. Said I could re-image in 6 months or have u/s guided core needle biopsy for definitive answer. Was freaking out, so opted for biopsy. Final diagnosis: Intraductal papilloma with extensive apocrine metaplasia and focal apocrine adenosis. Report reads: Several fragments of fibrous and adipose breast tissue contain portions of an intraductal papilloma, which shows extensive apocrine metaplasia. Despite a crowded-appearing epithelial surface, the papilloma is apparently well-organized with a predominantly double-layered epithelium, but there is a focus in the third level containing back-to-back glands with variable apocrine epithelium apparently embedded in the stroma of the papilloma. Immunostains for calponin, p63 and smooth muscle myosin clearly demonstrate a myoepithelial layer around those glands and throughout the papilloma excluding the possibility of an invasive neoplasm. The embedded glands appear to be a focus of adenosis within the papilloma. No atypical or malignant changes are identified in this material. Breast doc has assured me it's benign and has not recommended removal; no pain or nipple discharge. Barring any other changes, he says I can return in a year. He does not feel that this puts me at higher risk, but I worry anyway. Once you've had one of these, are you more likely to develop more, either in the same or the other breast? Also, biopsy was done almost 6 weeks ago, and I can still feel swelling from what I think was the actual needle track (literally feels like a straight line) under the skin. Is this typical? Anything I could/should do about it? They put in a clip but told me I wouldn't be able to feel it. I'm concerned about all the additional mamms I've had on the right over the years. And between the papilloma and the fibro both occurring in the same breast, I worry whether b/c is inevitable. Anyone out there who can put some of this report in layperson's terms? I've done some googling but would prefer to hear from someone with first-hand experience. Are my feelings normal? It's like I can't even enjoy good news when I get it. Apologies for this long post.

Diagnosed with a very tiny intraductal papilloma, no atypia (B9), which my surgeon said could be left alone as it was causing no pain or nipple discharge. Just when I thought I could take a breath..... Last night I did my monthly BSE. I'm 53, perimenopausal. My periods are getting lighter and skipping around. I do my regular BSE on the first of the month but feel as though I'm always checking myself in the shower anyway, almost daily and to the point of distraction. Last night I found something in my left breast. It's very small, and it feels like it's very close to the surface, maybe an inch and a half above the nipple. Chalk up another sleepless night. I spoke with my breast health center first thing this morning, only to find that the breast surgeon I've dealt with for the past 10+ years is on vacation this week. The first day he's back is Friday the 12th, and I have an appointment then. They suggested that I might want to see my GYN so that she can do a manual exam and order further testing, if she feels it's necessary. If so, the tests would be ready for my breast MD when he returns. Will be seeing her tomorrow morning. I know that I shouldn't panic until I definitively have something to panic about, but when you're prone to anxiety, the \"what-if's\" descend pretty quickly. Any shared wisdom would be most appreciated. I've learned so much on these boards, and I'm looking for help again. Log in to post a reply",

I can't stop touching or thinking about my breast. Then today I went to a specialty lingerie store to have a bra fitting because I wanted to find something without an underwire that still gave me support. I'm a 34B and have always been saggy, but I guess perimenopause and gravity have taken their toll also. Tried something on and liked it, only to find when I got home and looked at the tag that it  can accommodate a breast form! So now I'm totally freaking because I'm thinking, \"Well, this could be in the cards for me, so I'd better get used to it.\" Nuts, right? Has anyone else had a lump described as \"tubular?\" Also, could someone explain what \"dimpling\" looks like? Is it circular, linear, etc. in appearance? It's going to be a long wait for my diag. mamm and u/s on the 16th; follow up with my MD at the breast health center on the 19th. I'm so hoping that the testing will show what this is without having to have a biopsy again. Please know that all of you are in my prayers. I am grateful for all of you. Even women I consider to be close friends are weary of hearing about my breast misadventures.",

As soon as she walked in the door, she said right away that she'd be happy to check me out and get the ball rolling as far as ordering any tests, but that the breast doc would be the MD in charge. That's exactly what I thought she'd say, so no surprises there. Bottom line, she said (twice) that she doesn't think this is anything worrisome, but she did order a diagnostic mamm and ultrasound. Both of these will be done week after next. But then when I got home and looked at the order, the \"what-ifs\" started all over again. She wrote \"tubular lump\" and \"? vein\" and \"? other\". So naturally I can't help myself and start googling around. I find references to Mondor's Syndrome (rare but benign) and tubular cancer (also uncommon, but cancer).  I've been seeing this GYN for 10+ years, and I still don't know how to read her. Should I take comfort in her saying that she doesn't think it's going to be terrible news, or is she figuring that the ball will be in another doctor's court anyway? It's going to be a long 2+ weeks until I get to see the breast doc, for sure.",

Can anyone tell me how long I'll continue to feel scar tissue at the biopsy site? At first it's as though I could feel the actual needle track, if that makes sense. Now that is feeling less defined/hard and the area is feeling a bit more bumpy. Is this what happens as the scar tissue starts to dissolve? As I've never had anything like this done to me before (anywhere on my body!), I have nothing to compare it to. I had an annual physical at the end of Dec. with my primary care practitioner. He did a very thorough breast exam and said everything felt fine. I'm not scheduled for another mamm at my breast health center until the end of October, which is my 1-yr date. Even though everything turned out fine, I still feel quite rattled by all this. Friends don't want to hear about it. They say that since I got good results, I should just put it behind me and move on. I know that what I experienced isn't even a bean in a hill of beans compared to what many of you brave women have been through. But I feel absolutely paranoid about my breasts at this point. Turning 53 this week, perimenopausal, and just wondering whether the anxiety will ever go away. Log in to post a reply",
