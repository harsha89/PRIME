I had a total masectomy on the affected breast ...But I constantly worry about the remaining one . I feel so guilty.. Some of the other women have had it so much harder than me ( because I opted for the masectomy no chemo no rads) And I am still so anxious . Right after my surgery I was on a high . All I have had to do is take Arimidex every day My oncologist ( I see him for the Arimidex) said this was a \" bump in the road\" and re occurance was less tha 1 % . Yet still I am on pins and needles when mammo time rolls around again . Does anyone out there do the same ? I look forward to feedback . Thanks All , Debbi",
