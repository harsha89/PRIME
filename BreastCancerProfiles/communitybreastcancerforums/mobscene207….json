My MO laid it all out in simple terms -- she even drew pictures! My best advice is to listen first, then ask questions. She covered just about everything I had questions about, and brought up things I hadn't considered (coldcapping, which I am doing; and getting a port, which I did). I immediately liked and trusted my MO, and that has been key for me. If you are not comfortable with yours after meeting them, consider looking for someone else. Good luck",
