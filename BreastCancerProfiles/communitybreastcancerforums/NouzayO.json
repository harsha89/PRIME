I agree with ShetlandPony, I too noticed that those with bone mets only tend to do better and live longer but once the liver mets kick in things get complicated unfortunately. I was diagnosed stage 4 de novo with liver and bone mets and struggled with short lived medications and now trying to choose a different one and really want to make the right choice, if there\u2019s such a thing with MBC! I appreciate all your stories, insights and encouragement!! Please, if you\u2019ve started doing things differently to augment the medication effectiveness, tell me about your experiences!! Certain excercise, alternative medicine or dietary restrictions.. anything!! I noticed that alot of you tried Faslodex and were successful for a long time, I was never offered that .. I tried Ibrance and femara for 6 months before it failed me. Now I\u2019m considering Halaven, but not a lot of you seem to have it under your statuses?? I\u2019m tired of IV chemo after 8 months on Abraxane! And the Xeloda did nothing for me! Z - you mentioned working with an immunologist in Japan?? And something about adaptive cell therapy?? Would you be willing to share more info?? I\u2019m also considering doing a foundation one test or a CARIS test, anyone got good advice on how to proceed with those??? Did the results change your treatment plans?? Thank you ladies for being an incredible source of hope and virtual support to all of us metzers out there!! I love you all !! Heba",

I had that on Ibrance in the first month and that landed me in ICU for a week and I had just left the hospital after delivering my baby. So alot of PTSD when it comes to neutropenia!",

Thank you for leading me to this group :) I'm sorry you are having a hard time with SE .. those drugs never conform to any norms when it comes to SE or even efficacy.. ugh 😑 Doxil is really easy and I was really hoping I can get it to work fir a year or so but oh well.. nothing ever goes according to plan with this freakish disease! It's a once a month injection with low incidence of allergic reactions, no hair loss mostly, no weird GI stuff either, mainly the only thing is hand foot syndrome which most people are ok with but of course I'm the exception! This can be mostly managed with urea creams before its onset and of course during, I love udderly smooth cream, epsom salt foot bath, full body baths are great too but I didn't have time for that with 3 kiddos, if things get really out of control then decadron and a reduced dosage should improve things. Some people did icing of hand and feet during infusion but I didn't because I felt it didn't make much sense since SE actually show up in the third or fourth week! The major concern for Doxil is cardio toxicity but they monitor that with an echo every three months. There's a maximum number of infusions you can take due to that.There's also a doxil thread, that is active despite only being a small group. Some people on there actually stayed on Doxil for more than a year!! If you get the brow gel watch some YouTube videos on how to achieve a natural look .. you may have to adjust according to how much hair you have there already .. I found I needed to use more than they recommended as I lost more hair ...it's amazing how there's a YouTube video for anything these days 😜",

Currently I have elevated liver functions since the Y90 .. one of them just won't come down!! They were also very high when I was put on Ibrance immediately after giving birth and I had neutropenia. It was probably due to all the rapidly dying cancer cells .. my tumor markers were in the 4000s !!

Unfortunately I will be leaving Verzenio and moving on .. I don't have a ton of treatment options I think and ready wished Verzenio would last longer and be effective for some double digits months but it is what it is. After my Y90, my scans showed that the procedure seems to be successful in terms of liver mets refuction in both size and activity.. actually two of three are non active!! However, bone cancer is more active but the report never stated exactly how much. Against a couple of MO's advice I decided to stick with Verzenio a little longer on the basis that I haven't been taking it regularly during the month of recovery from Y90 due to severe side effects. I did take it religiously for two months 150 at night and 100 in the am. The first month the tumor markers stayed stable and I took it as a good sign. I had my scans right before Christmas and it came back showing again « more bone activity » but also a few new liver mets!!!! In just one short month and my tumor markers rose by 30 points. I'm so bummed right now because that means that all the Y90 suffering was for nothing and may have to go through all this again if my next treatment didn't work. I'm trying Lynparza next even though I only have a somatic mutation not a genetic one. I was also offered Afinitor but the comments on that thread have been very discouraging. I also have Halaven as an option but aside from trying to avoid IV chemos at the moment I'm trying to save it when liver mets are a lot worse because then I'll need something that can act fast. Hopefully I made the right choice and can live with the new side effects. Good luck to you all my fellow liver metzers ❤️",

It\u2019s really disheartening to see someone develop BC around pregnancy..I honestly never suspected it in my case! It\u2019s becoming more common, I have two friends that also had BC during pregnancy recently but thank God they discovered it in early stages. I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s working for you! Hopefully for a long time.. what made you stop? Were you off medication all together when you reached NED ? What are some of SE with the treatment for you? I know we are all different but it kind of helps to be prepared psychologically to what\u2019s coming .. I also benefit a lot from people\u2019s insights regarding how to handle side effects and stuff .. those boards got me through a lot ",

I have been on Lynparza since December after Verzenio failed me. I had Y90 done in September because Verzenio was working at the time at least for bones but as some of you may remember I had a tough recovery from that surgery that messed up with medicine metabolism then Verzenio failed. Lynparza worked well for bones the first 3 months but not liver .. I had two new spots in liver apparently they were there when I did Y90 but IR said they were too small to detect so they got bigger. My options were move on to Halaven, start a phase 1 trail or do another Y90. Against my vows not to mess up with the liver again, I chose doing another Y90. I did the shunt study, I had a plan and it was time to do my regular PET and MRI after 2 months since the medication I'm on seems to be failing (usually it's 3months between scans). I figured let's schedule surgery right after scans just in case there are other minute tumors, the IR would have the latest image before going in and hopefully can make last minute adjustments. He said don't wait for scans but it only added one week to wait so I waited. I was scheduled to have the Y90 tomorrow but I got the results yesterday. The 3 mets I had got bigger and I have 5 new ones!!!! All in a span of two months!! They are in different locations. One of them actually is in an ablation zone that I did a year and a half ago. IR said let's just do the surgery regardless and we can have a plan for the other mets later. But that means I will have to wait at least another 4 weeks to address those, I can't switch treatments and apparently Lynparza is doing nothing for liver. So in 4 weeks I may have an explosion in liver at that rate! I asked him to consider postponing surgery for a week or so and have a plan to get them all done at once. After consulting with his team he said there's no way he can do it all at once and I may even reach my maximum allowance of radioactive medication and have to resort to ablation for a couple of them. Yet he still thinks doing Y90 is better option. I told him why don't we do chemo again now to shrink them then hopefully deal with less mets if we need to. He responded that recent research suggests that doing Y90 after chemo has a higher risk of liver damage and less success rate. I'm really overwhelmed, disappointed yet grateful I didn't do the surgery a week ago! I'm leaning towards Halaven but really not mentally ready to go back to IV chemo with all its drama: neutropenia, hair loss and other side effects.. ugh! Besides, I feel Halaven is my only real last option.. going there so soon means I'm nearing the end :( Any words of wisdom?? How was Halaven for those who tried it? Anyone tried fasting with it? Any supplements that made it work longer?? Did cold capping work?? Please pray for me ..",

I haven\u2019t thought about doing a biopsy for the new mets, great idea! It\u2019s interesting what we wish for sometimes, if this thing is mutating to have new receptors it will open new doors! I pray and wish for you the best outcome with the upcoming biopsy results.. keep us posted! I\u2019m a bit worried about getting a biopsy from liver though but I\u2019ll definitely consider it!! I did have foundation one done before but nothing of real interest came back from that .. that\u2019s how I ended up with Lynparza (based on a BRCA somatic mutation not genetic mutation). If I get a biopsy and it turns out different I\u2019ll consider sending it again even though my insurance didn\u2019t cover it the first time after they said they would.. 😑 My MO did mention Afinitor a few times but reading about all the horror stories with this drug on these boards is making me very nervous to try it.. I can\u2019t believe you got such a long run on that ... That\u2019s amazing !! How interesting that our bodies work so differently yet we are all offered the same treatment options. A friend f mine is currently on Gem/carbo for ovarian cancer and she\u2019s having such a rough time with it but it is another option I guess. JFL, you\u2019ve been on my mind too.. I sent you a pm but I got worried when I didn\u2019t hear back from you.. I totally understand though .. I did also ask my MO about Navelbine but she wasn\u2019t too excited about it but I guess it\u2019s an option as well. JFL why didn\u2019t you go back to Halaven after the clinical study ?? I\u2019m assuming it didn\u2019t fail you, you just switched, right? I'm praying for a miracle for both us and all of us .. we all deserve to get some good news!! . Thank you all again for your input !!! Please keep them coming",

I knew I had to do it and that it\u2019s not something I can hide for long .. I also had an added complication because I was 32 weeks pregnant with my last baby when I got diagnosed and it was a horrible, painful pregnancy every step of the way .. they saw me deteriorate and endure so much pain with no real explanation as to why all this is happening to their mom. To me it all happened so quickly from the day I got diagnosed to the day I had my baby it was only two weeyand my husband and I decided that we should discuss my diagnosis before I go in to have the baby just in case I never came back home. I took a week to understand what\u2019s going on, do all the scans and get some answers and wrap my head around all this which as you can imagine was a nightmare and a few days before delivery we sat them down separately to talk to them according to their age, ability to undetand their character. They were 12 and 8 at the time. I made sure to explain things honestly but not too negatively and give them a chance to ask questions and made sure to stress that they can come to me st any time with more questions whenever they feel like it. I used a guideline from the American Cancer Society for inspiration.. I can\u2019t find a link to the exact one I read but I put a link to one of the several ones they have .. it\u2019s very useful. I also emailed a copy to all the family members who would be spending more time with my kids than normal so they don\u2019t get cornered and not know what to say. I also asked them not to approach them before I talk to them first so they hear it from me. Good luck.. hope this helps https://cancer.org/treatment/children-and-cancer/when-a-family-member-has-cancer/dealing-with-diagnosis/how-to-tell-children.html",

Candy, I feel exactly the same way about radiologists and even oncologists .. I\u2019m questioning the whole healthcare system as a matter of dact despite having several family members who are medical doctors!! I spent the last 2 months going through the exact same thing. I had a scan after my Y90 both PET and liver MRI though they diced abd sliced the liver in their report they brushed the bone mets leaving me with an alarming note that prompts change in treatment without giving me any real numbers.. they said I have five more active bone lesions in such and such places but no SUV numbers or even tumor size. I refused to change treatments based on that report and requested to know more .. my MO, who btw are obviounot trained to actually read the scans and rely heavily on the reports, said sge tried contacting radiology to have them reread the scans but they wouldn\u2019t!! I get treated at Emory University a big medical establishment and as JFL said the residents usually read the scans first and the attending signs off on them. But to feel that you\u2019re too important to go back a read something based on a single patient request is really beyond me!! I feel private practices are more harmonious in their care when it comes to stuff like that because the radiologist is there abd the doctor can easily go to him and read the scans together. At least that\u2019s what a medical oncologist friend in Colombia does. I decided to continue on my treatment for teo more months hoping that I\u2019ll get a better response or at least stability.. then my late December scans are done and lo and behold the report not only fails to include numbers and specifics regarding the bone lesions they even compared this scan to one from five months ago!!! So basically There\u2019s no way I can monitor the progression of the bone mets based on that report.. ugh!! I emailed my MO over the break and drew her attention to that mistake and she said she she\u2019ll take care of it. After many failed attempts to get tgem to answer her questions she walked to their department and read the scans with a radiologist finally!!! She came back saying \u201cyes, they seem to be more active\u201d!!!! That\u2019s it! I saw her last week and requested that the report be addended .. they finally did that and surprise surprise they found a few liver mets that were not reoprted on the initial report!!! Wth??? I call my IR doctor who answered immediately (that\u2019s not the norm btw) and he said yes they are indeed new liver mets that were not included in the PET nor the liver MRI report.. he suggested another surgery or a change in treatment. I\u2019ve been very frustrated with all this so I completely understand your concerns. Now I have to change the medication because it seems in just a short month all this happened.. I was taking my pills religiously that past couple of months and the first month my TM was stable which I took as a good sign but I just got my TM for my last visit and it is 30 point higher .. which probably means that when the liver mets appeared only last month. I feel that it\u2019s not fair that we have to do the legwork fir the doctors and keep pushing all the time we should at least have the peace of mind that we are in good hands! Sorry for venting but hopefully this experience would at least help someone out there",
