It took me a while to make a connection between these bras and my rashes.  I checked the label and sure enough, the pads are made if polyurethane.  I thought this was a kind of varnish.  I intend to call Nordstroms and make them aware of the problem.  In the meantime, I can't seem to find any repacement bras as they all seem to have polyurethane padded cups.  I wonder if there are any companies which make padded bras using safer materials.",
