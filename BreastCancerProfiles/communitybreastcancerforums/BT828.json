The 4 boosts at the end were easy and gave my breast where the blisters were a chance to start healing before I was done. I finished on a Thursday and by Sat turned the corner and started seeing improvement. Now, 2 1/2 months out, it's all good except in the last week have developed some pain and stiffness from my lx scar (10:00) up into my armpit. RO told me it could happen as breast tissue heals, he showed me massage technique but said if I needed some help they have a great PT that works with the BC patients. So far, so good...My range of motion is ok but still wake up with a swollen breast which resolves shortly after I get up. I've been fortunate so far with letrozole. A little stiffness in my toes & hands but that's not all the time, a little insomnia that seems to have gone away since I changed the time I take it to AM instead of PM. A few headaches but ibuprofen takes care of that. It's been very doable. ",

You can keep them in the fridge so when you put it on your breast it totally sucks the heat out while it hydrates. The only problem with them is you have to be laying down to keep them where you want them, not made to wear while moving around. I had 2 sizes, 4x4 & 8x8.",
