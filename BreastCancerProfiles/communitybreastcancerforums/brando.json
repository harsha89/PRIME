Now, my radiation oncologist says BECAUSE I am thin, I have a higher risk of getting LE. She says this because I do not have enough fat to redistribute the lymphatic fluid in my arm. I would like to know what everyone's take is on this information. I am just finishing up rads and on my left arm (the bc side), it aches and feels like there is a blood pressure cup on it (a tightening and squeezing feel). I have gone to a physical therapist and so far they have not detected any swelling or anything. I just want to know if this is a start of LE even as no swelling has occurred. I feel the rads are what will do me in and LE will be just around the corner....

There is only one test site in the United States (and, really the world) that tests for the BRCA gene mutations. Once those results are available there are really no protective devices around in terms of info leaking out to life insurance companies and such. Also, if you do test your daughter and you falsely claim no knowledge of her having this higher-than-average chance of getting certain cancers and it is found out, it could lead to her unable to be insured. Since 1994 when the BRCA gene mutation was \"accidentally\" discovered, no real protection of the carriers have been firmly in place. Matter of fact, even if someone who carries these mutations and knows about them, yet do not have cancer, they could possibly have to pay higher premiums for life insurance, or worse, be denied. There are no laws protecting the carriers of this genetic mutation in terms of obtaining insurance. I just want you to know as much as you can before you make your own, informed decision. It is a lot to think about. --brando",

Like all laws, they are never concrete, often very wordy for the lay person to comprehend, and often do not deliver in all its intended purposes. The main point here is to be careful with health information for minors. It may seem trite, but you do not always have protection when it comes to any information regarding your health...I have worked in healthcare for many years and there is not a week that goes by where health information is not violating the HIPPA guidelines set forth from congress and the president. --brando",
