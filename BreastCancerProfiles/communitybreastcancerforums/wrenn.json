My breasts are large and basically a nuisance now that I am 66 years old. The bilateral is for balance. I think I might have given it more thought if I was younger because i would be thinking more about appearance but for now I just want them gone. I feel like they are monsters who betrayed me and I would always be wondering when it would hit the other breast. Rationally survival won't be affected by my decision but emotions will be. I feel lucky that the decision was an easy one for me. I hope you can decide and be happy with your decision once you have talked to your surgeon. ",

Apocrine tumors, even when triple negative, are less likely to involve the lymph nodes, are more responsive to treatment, and may have a better prognosis than more common types of invasive ductal cancer.

It is one thing after another isn't it.  I have a feeling my sponge baths are harder than others than me since I am getting used to smelling funky. My dressings go under my arms so impossible to wear deodorant.  I have a chemo teaching class tomorrow so am going to slather it on even if it wrecks the dressings.  I expect my dressing to be saturated tomorrow anyway since I am finally seeing surgeon today and she might take out the remaining drain. That means the dark red blood will be on a dressing instead of in the tube but at least it is movement finally. I am hoping removing drain is all that is required and that something else isn't going on making the output red instead of yellow. I may have to take an ativan before I go. I used to take ativan about 3 times a year but lately it is becoming more necessary. arghhhh. Take care everyone. xo",

I am waiting for a good day.  What frustrates me is that I have never had such a long recovery from other surgeries. This damn well better pay off. P.S.

I think it is worth it in the long run even if you have to catch up financially eventually. I hope it turns around for you soon. I think the reason I didn't want to start now is because I am feeling sick with the cold and I want to be at my best when I start because I don't trust myself to not quit chemo if side effects are bad. I think because I am sick already I might attribute anything negative to chemo and quit. Truthfully, I am not 100% convinced that I want to do chemo and I am working on that. I am not sure it is worth it and I feel guilty admitting that since so many people insist that it must be done. I feel like someone will think I am suicidal if I opt out so I want to be sure I am feeling strong going in since it won't take much for me to walk away from it. My MO is one of the top guys here and is reasonable but insists using Claritin doesn't make sense. He is also very casual too so wouldn't care if I took it but just doesn't believe it would do anything. I will check to see how it affects blood pressure since mine is high and I will use it. He has said to take ativan or clonazepam when I want for anxiety too. I am fed up with not feeling well. I never get colds and so I know I am run down. I am also nauseous all the time (stopped the blood builder yesterday in case it was that but will take it again today since nausea is still there without it). I am sick of having a dressing pulling on my chest and itching because of the tape. I am sick of having home care come in to pull out icky packing and repack. I want some energy. I keep hoping that I will start to feel stronger and go into chemo with a gung ho attitude saying \"I can do this\" but right now I don't feel energetic enough to do that. In the past I could fix things by determination. I could easily lose weight by focusing and could get rid of arthritic pain by focusing on icing and avoiding certain foods but I feel like no matter what I try I am still feeling shitty. I think this might just be one of those days so I apologize for whining again. At least I have learned from here that things do come and go in waves and it WILL get better.

Nevertheless, 33%\u201386% of MBC patients receive chemotherapy and are, in fact, twice as likely to receive chemotherapy as similarly matched patients with IDC [8, 11, 19]. Single institution retrospective studies and genomic profiling suggest that these tumors are largely chemoresistant [19]. A report from the Mayo clinic detailed 27 patients treated at their center over 20 years in which 33% received chemotherapy. Ten different regimens were used, resulting in one partial response [11]. This resistance to chemotherapies is likely a product of the complex genetic and nongenetic mechanisms within MBC that result in phenotypically diverse subclones and intratumoral heterogeneity.\" That's from NIH and makes me think I should just trust that the cancer is gone thanks to BMX.",

The anxiety is my only obstacle and I wonder if that ever goes away? I have a friend with multiple myeloma and she is in a panic over a possible cyst on her breast. We sometimes laugh over every little thing being the cancer back but when you see so many cases of it actually coming back no wonder. I am so sorry your fears were real. Although I know you will be fine I also know that it is a nightmare regardless of how easy the routines and treatments are. The fact that you were 'done' so recently makes it so much worse. Another thing that makes it easier for me is that I am almost 70 with a daughter who is about to be married to a man I really love so I don't have to worry about her. I can't imagine taking all the crap you have been dealt while having children at home. I have 3 nephews who are paramedics (2 paramedic/firefighters) and two who are firefighters alone and I know they have great work teams so I imagine you having that support to turn to but they don't have cancer let alone recurrence so you must feel pretty alone sometimes. I am keeping you in my version of prayers and hope you can do this again without too much of a struggle. Take care of yourself.",

I was that sure I couldn't make it a few extra feet. Once in there I seemed to get 'muscle memory' of what it was like to shop and my body said \"hmmm this is familiar.

It was only a block but I felt like a toddler taking it's first steps and was so proud. Now today I want to try it again and may go to the corner for a hair cut.   I still have my bloody (literally) drain. Even though it is down to 20mls and less it is bright red and worries me. I see doc thursday. I still have dressing on the old removed drain side from when it was infected so assuming getting the last drain out won't mean immediate shower since it will likely have a dressing for a few days too. But, I feel free having walked and am getting used to being aware that I might not smell floral any more. Poodle I hope you get your freedom back soon.

I worried that it was something abnormal for me so it is good to know that we are proceeding as we should and that this nightmare recovery is somewhat \"normal\".  I agree that the tubes being gone makes such a difference though and we don't have to worry about protecting them from being yanked out.

Poodlemum sorry things are not going well and I hope the family emergencies resolve so you can focus on getting better. Lisa, I have a feeling my MO went easy on me because of my age and my panic disorder.  I also have a family history of heart attacks so they are using something that doesn't damage the heart. I have been reading that taxol works better than taxotere so wondered if I wouldn't really be \"covered\" as far as getting any stray cancer but I decided that I will just go with the flow as much as possible because if I don't tolerate chemo I worry that I will give it up.  I think it is a fine balance with me as far as nerves go and I like you am terrified of anyone messing with my chest (ports) and am terrified that any serious side effects will send me running away from treatment.  I am also stage 1 so that might make a difference. I noticed you are doing the same combination as me KBeee and you aren't triple negative. It is confusing to try to figure out how they decide what will work for us.  KBeee are you doing every 3 weeks and for how long. Mine is every three weeks for 12 weeks. Seems short to me but until I know how bad it is I am happy with it. I will be following you closely although you are way more upbeat than me in general which I think makes a huge difference. :-) I've been trying to read more books on healing or being in a relaxed state of mind because I really think I have to work on that angle more. I was reading 'Spontaneous Healing' by Andrew Weil and am going to try to do some meditation (have never been able to pull that off).   Do any of you use ebooks? Thank you again for all of the information and sharing of experiences here. I really couldn't manage without it. What a great place to go for information and support. whew.",

It does make it easier knowing we aren't alone because most of the time we are SO alone in all of this. My daughter was supposed to come over yesterday to help with some things but had to work late and although I know she has no choice when it comes to work I felt sorry for myself as if she didn't care. This ordeal is so horrific to me that I am puzzled that people just go on as if it is no big deal.  I find it hard to be rational.   While I feel bad that you are going before me I am also relieved to know I can come here and read about your experience and everyone else's.  We really hit the jackpot with this site.  I was not even told anything about triple negative all through this and when I saw the term on here I went back to look at my pathology report and deducted that I had 3 negative notations and so that must mean I fit that category.   My surgeon couldn't see me until 5 weeks post op and then said \"everything is fine. See you in a year\".  No word on why I look like I was attacked by a shark and I really didn't feel like she had time to answer any questions so I didn't bother asking. If this forum hadn't been here I would have felt really lost given the lack of help from my \"team\".  I am hoping the chemo \"team\" is more responsive but if they aren't I still have you wonderful women. I hope everyone has an ok day. xoxo",

I will have to read again tomorrow. Lisa, I am so sorry for the delay. I can't believe it. You finally got to the day and that had this happen. As if surgery and chemo weren't hard enough to handle there always seem to be delays and changes along the way. argghhhhh. I have a massive infection and the infection that was deep in my chest burrowed a tunnel to the surface where my incision was so now I am having this 7cm hole packed with long stips of dressing. It doesn't hurt but I can feel it deep in my chest and back and it is worse than scratching a chald board as far as creepy. Back on antibiotics and dressings (still no showers) and not sure what it will do to chemo schedule. The silver lining is that I have a new team. I refuse to go back to the original surgeon who dismissed all of the comications and refuse to go back to the hospital. I spent 4 and a half days in a good hospital with attentive staff and am blown away by the difference. I am really fed up that it is such a mess but am hopeful that the problems might be solved finally. I wil follow up with the new surgeon next week. Thank you for the support and good wishes. I was reading on my phone and thanks to the iOS upgrade the battery was dying fast so I didn't get to it much and was unable to post without going through an ordeal. I will try reading again tomorrow with a clear head and Lisa I hope you can have an ok evening given all you are going through. grrrrrr. One more thing...helped me put my frustration in perspective. The woman in the bed next to me was diagnosed last year with IBC with bone and brain mets and this week discovered to have a bowel obstruction. Yesterday they removed part of her bowel and installed a colostomy. She now has bowel mets and woke up still being upbeat. She actually looks good and will be in hospital 8 more days to recover from this major surgery but will be taken by ambulance to the cancer agency in about 6 days for her chemo treatment which is part of a study. I think she will make it. ok. goodnight special women. xo",

Positive thinking has become the standard, and those who do not, or cannot, think positive thoughts often feel guilty for not measuring up. But a diagnosis of cancer is a sad event. The disease brings loss, even for those who are cured. People who have cancer lose parts of the body. The cancer or its treatment may make them ill. They lose not only thier health, but also a sense of well-being and security about the future. Some even find that former friends disappear, unable themselves to face the losses. Those who pretend to others and to themselves that everything is fine do so at a cost. False cheerfulness takes energy, at a time when they may have little to spare. Emotional dishonesty keeps others at a distance. We live in a culture that does not acknowledge sadness as part of life, that considers it evidence of weakness or moral failing. Sadness is unwelcome, a social barrier that makes others uncomfortable. When people with cancer pretend to be cheerful they may make it easier on their family and friends, and health professionals, by not requiring them to face their own grief. Sadness is not depression. Major depression can take the form of despair, a bleak outlook that colours everything. It can be obsessive rumination, paralyzing guilt, or an inability to face the day and accomplish what needs to be done. Depression is a legitimate disorder that deserves to be treated. But Sadness is part of living. We are sad because life does not match our dreams, because we lose what we love and we lose what we need, because others let us down. Because our own bodies let us down. People with cancer usually try to return to the person they once were, but most will be changed in some way. Those who allow themselves to be sad can recognize the losses and grieve for them. When they can admit that the old life and the old self are gone and find the strength to let them go they can create a new self to respond to the new situation. Some gain a new perspective. They may see life differently than they saw it before. Those who want to be supportive of someone with cancer can do so by allowing them to be real, to feel what they feel. Those with cancer need someone to cry with, someone who is comfortable with the sadness. When they can count the losses they can grieve for what is gone and can move on to the next chapter of their lives. by: Karen Ritchie M.D.",

Ridley, I wonder if you can tell them how it's going so far and then tell them of changes? Maybe they would like to hear about it from you. I am lucky to not have to face decisions like that since I am retired. There are so many angles to this damn disease. sigh. I hope you get things organized for you soon. KBeee that is ridiculous about the \"bug bite\". The day after surgery the home care nurse came to check on me and couldn't get a blood pressure and finally got one of 86/37 and I was very short of breath and passing out. She called 911. I was bleeding. When the ambulance got me to the hospital and not much later the ER doc came to my bedside and said \"I think you had a panic attack\". I said \"Panic attacks raise my blood pressure and they don't make me bleed\". My sister insisted on them checking further and a CT Scan showed a massive hematoma that was bleeding outside the drain site. It lowered my Hgb and is still what is causing problems two months later. I mostly have had good luck in emergency depts but sometimes you run into some dolts. Pam, it's nice to see you here. I hope you are feeling better. I guess it takes time but little improvement maybe. What a relief to be around people who get it. Hope everyone has a good sleep. ox",

Did or does anyone feel heat under the skin post mastectomy? I have been feeling hot near my armpit (not the node side) and not really near my wound and it is making me nervous. Home care said the wound doesn't look infected and skin doesn't feel warm on the surface so she doesn't know what it is from. I worry that the damn hematoma is still there festering up again but the surgeon had said last visit that it is unlikely. Since I have only 2 weeks before I finally have chemo I don't want another infection. They will do chemo with an open wound but not if there is an infection. I am just wondering if this heat is a normal sensation from muscles or nerves regenerating 3 months post op.

I am always being asked to clarify and will finally see where what I said didn't make sense. Hoping that is \"chemo brain\" and will clear up. Because I had numbness and tingling with periodic severe pain in my hands and legs (especially burning on feet) my internist said it was likely peripheral neuropathy from the chemo. I went to a neurologist who did EMG studies and she said that I don't have neuropathy. Because I was recently diagnosed as hypothyroid the neurologist said the pain could be from that and treating the hypo might help. I have a friend who developed severe arthritis after her chemo and so I wonder if my pain is my pre-existing osteo arthritis just getting worse (way worse)?  I am holding out hope that taking synthroid for thyroid will help. I do think I see a bit of a difference after a week and a half on thyroid meds.  I think taxotere really does a number on many systems in the body. My oncologist (who I see today for first follow up since he cancelled treatments) said in a tv interview that his goal is to eventually see a time where they can avoid such dangerous toxicity to women's bodies. That would be nice. I have two friends who sailed through chemo. They had colon and liver cancers both stage 4. They did not lose hair and were never laid up (out shopping etc). They also didn't lose hair and unrelated...since I feel so mutilated....you can;t see where they had the surgery. I think breast cancer and it's treatment is a nightmare all around and I still feel guilty that I dodged most of what you women are going through. Maybe if their colons and livers were on the outside of the body and they had to have them reconstructed it would be different.  I am sure their nightmares are similar given that any cancer is life threatening but watching and reading here has made me amazed and impressed with the strength and courage of breast cancer people. Take care everyone.",

I had surgery August 16th and had homecare coming daily or every other day until boxing day. I still feel weird getting in the shower without wearing plastic bags. It is so freeing. I had a BMX and 6 clear nodes removed. I am triple neg so should have started chemo earlier than the date I started (Nov 25th). I developed diverticulitis so was cut off chemo and saw onc in 4 months and now see him every 6 months. I am about to have a D&C to biopsy my thickened uterine lining. I was spotting and cramping (not good at age 67) and am not looking forward to another anesthetic but for some reason I am not worried about outcome. I have peripheral neuropathy which shouldn't happen from one infusion of taxotere/cytoxan but I think that combined with the cipro/flagyl for the diverticulitis the same week is what caused it. I am having trouble walking but still really feel pretty good especially when I read what other's endure. The weirdest chemo side effect is my curley hair. I had really straight hair before and now I look like I got an old lady perm. It is growing very slowly but picked up some after starting on synthroid. I became hypothyroid in the spring and the meds seemed to make my hair grow faster. I guess my post seems to have a lot of complaints but really I feel lucky and am happy to be here. I hope more of the woman check in. This was a nice idea to start this thread. Take care everyone. xoxo",

The sinus goes 3cm deep and then 8cm across and veers off another 4cm so I am trying to not picture that as they are stuffing that tunnel with a long strip of packing. Ick. It doesn't hurt though. I am surprised still that recovery from a BMX is still happening going into the 7th week postop but I guess it is not unusual.  I will find out this week if chemo is delayed again but I am not that worried since I don't really feel like I have the strength to deal with it anyway.  I have started reading books to change my attitude or to trust the gods more to try to decrease my anxiety level and this forum is better than any book as far as helping me to keep a perspective.

I like the sound of 3 out of 3 better and you will be there soon. :-) Also, thanksgiving and christmas will make time fly I bet. Lisa, I think of you when I get discouraged because you always bounce back. I am glad you are already starting to feel better. You have also taught me that you can be discouraged and down and climb out of it quickly. I tended to stay down too long. I am seeing the surgeon today but don't expect to hear much. He basically got stuck with me when I quit my first surgeon and is only following up on the wound care. One good thing that happened yesterday was that I got a new family doctor and I really like her. It felt like finally someone was paying attention. It felt so good to sign the papers requesting a transfer of all of my records from the other clinic. I had gone to it for years and loved my original family doc but it has gone down hill since she retired (just before I was diagnosed) and I am happy to move on. The new doc had me do some blood work and my hemoglobin is up to 118 which is better but my ferritin is low so I am anemic. I will start eating more iron rich foods. I suppose this won't help my cause for chemo but I am now thinking it is what it is and will trust the universe. In some ways I think I have a better chance of it not coming back if I just work on getting healthy in general and chemo will set that back big time. I will do it if it is approved but am starting to be ok with not doing it. Have a peaceful day friends. xo",

If cells had already moved the chemo could take care of it but the longer you wait the more cells would be released and it would be too overwhelming for the chemo to catch them all so the chemo would be a health risk not really worth it. It is worth putting your body through chemo if it destroys random cancer cells but after a point (which they said was 3 months) there was more of a chance that the chemo wouldn't catch it all so they wouldn't risk it. Seeing that many people have a recurrence even getting chemo 'on time' I worry about the risks too. If the chances of cancer coming back are high I wonder whether I am better off skipping the complications (and set backs to my healing). I am leaving it in the hands of the oncologist though so that when it comes back I won't blame myself. :-)",

He said he could do it now even with the wound and couldn't guarantee that it wouldn't become infected. He also doesn't think it will be closed up by the 25th but I am hoping that my general health will have improved (have a cold ) and so that I will feel more ready for dealing with the wound not healing. It might be closed to healed by then or at least I will feel stronger and ready for whatever comes up. He said that I do have Invasive Ductal Carcinoma AND metaplastic carcinoma and that he doesn't know if chemo will work on both or not but that it is a gamble with any chemo and the only way to tell will be if it doesn't come back. Metaplastic is a more rare type so I am going to do some more reading about that. I had seen the \"sarcomatous (metaplastic carcinoma) as a \"differential diagnosis\" on my path report and wanted to clear it up about whether it was IDC mainly and he said it had features of both. I have no feeling one way or the other on this since I am feeling sick but will give it all some thought and really hope to get healing. I am so glad to hear that you are all 'managing' no matter how hard it gets with SE. You make me feel like I can do it. Hope everyone has an ok weekend with minimal SE. xo Oh, I asked again about the Claritin and he insisted it would have no affect and didn't understand why anyone would use it with neulasta. He is kind of a big shot on the BC tumour board and seems to be up on things so it is confusing since there are so many who swear by it.",

I am anxious to see if my Hemoglobin has gone up so I can prove to him that it works. I took ativan last night and slept well and intend to use it liberally from now on. I worry a bit about being too tired to get out of bed for the home care nurses to change my dressings because I usually make sure the dishes are done and things are tidy for them coming but I decided I don't care about the mess and if I stink from lying in bed for hours they can wear a mask. :-) Thank you for posting. It really makes starting off this morning easier. I am taking a volunteer car service to chemo and they asked me if I had one or two support people (they allow max of 2 in the car). I wanted to say \"many many support people\" because I will feel this forum in my pocket. xoxo",

She told me they save it for severe cases and that I should continue with metoclopromide and ativan. I don't feel like I will throw up but just feel 'off' so not bad really.l am looking forward to the steroids being finished. I will take another sleeping pill tonight to get over that last dose. I hope you can get some of this resolved. I can understand you not wanting to be around people when you feel pissy too but if you really do need something more I hope you can force yourself out.I hope you have something for the diarrhea. Something I am finding interesting is urine incontinence. I think I might have to go but not urgent and stand up and it runs down my leg. Weirdest thing ever. No pain from the poisons touching me though. :-) My wound that was 1.8cm on Friday was .5cm today. I was thrilled and so was the home care nurse. It could really slow down actually closing for a while but so happy to hear that it is that close. Take care of yourself in whatever way you can.

I am actually afraid to have my remaining drain removed because of the seroma fear.  I had a huge mess of drainage come out of the side where my first drain was removed more than a week after removal. It was yellow gunk but the remaining drain although down to 20cc is still bright red blood and I don't want to be seeing that coming out a week later...or worse....not coming out. I wonder if all this fear and panic over drains is a distraction for me from the upcoming chemo. I can't imagine how badly I would be handling it if I had to do the massage and worry about seroma.

It is doubly hard to watch sisters struggle through treatment and reconstruction (which I was lucky to avoid) and still not be done with this stuff.

I am in such a fog that yesterday i went back and read all 16 pages of this thread to try to get a handle on it. Because i was told to not shower until drains were out i just did my morning bottom half with hand held and drain in a baggie held by my teeth and am now resting before wrapping myself in a garbage bag to wash my hair. Good grief. I hope your labs are good tomorrow so you can get started. It is a lot of information to take in but sounds like you are ready. My chemo starts 8 weeks post surgery. I hope yours starts soon. Enjoy your day as much as you can considering Hope everyone else is having an OK day as well. Take care all. Xoxo",

I like KBeee's idea of online Christmas shopping. It has to be so frustrating to be stuck there when you are feeling ok. Poodlemum, what a nightmare for you. I am so glad you have this forum to come and talk. I know it helps me and I really hope things improve for you soon. Lisa, sorry to hear about the fatigue. I like the way you describe it because I too was thinking \"ok, I'll be a bit more tired. No big deal\". But now I see what people mean by \"fatigue\". Ugh And I can understand you having to rest in the mall Pam. You seem to adapt well so I hope you got some shopping done in spite of it. I saw the surgeon on Thursday and he said the pocket open is about the size of the tip of his thumb but thought it would be better to get going on chemo because a non healing wound is less dangerous than avoiding chemo. The wound had started to bleed a bit and although the home care nurse said it was fine because it meant the wound was getting more oxygen (?) she did worry me when she said to call right away if it bled lots. I am still so paranoid of gushing blood since it happened before that she ruined my day. :-) I am seeing the nurse (probably a different one which means each day brings a new perspective) and hope the bleeding is minimal. I don't look at the wound and the dressing doesn't show the drainage. I think much of my problem is related to anxiety. I have a sensation of heat under my arm (wound side) that drives me crazy and every little twitch and sensation makes me worry that it is bleeding. I know there will be sensations with nerves regenerating but because of my couple of bleeds they make me nuts. The surgeon said he thinks the heat might just be regeneration but he is not sure. He says he can't say for sure whether the hematoma has cleared up but that he can't feel any pockets of fluid or any lumps so he thinks everything is ok. He did say \"I am usually wrong\" which I thought was cute. I am also tired of being uncomfortable and I don't think it is related to the wound but just normal healing after BMX. I still feel very tight across my chest and I think it is normal to feel anxious with any tightness in the chest area. I am also lumpy under my arms.....might have motivated me to not get so fat if I'd known this would affect surgery outcome. I am getting more anxious as chemo day approaches so I am so glad to be able to come here to see how you guys are doing. I just hope I can be as brave. I may have to start taking anti anxiety meds soon. I was holding off until chemo but haven't been sleeping well. I think I am lucky to avoid the A drug. It sounds like it is a bit rougher to manage. I hope everyone continues to soldier through this and it looks like you all are. Thank you again for the support and generous sharing of experiences. Hoping for a good weekend for all of you. xo sorry this is soooooo long",

He just said so we are here today to decide whether you have chosen to have chemo or not. Then he gave me the numbers.....75% chance of being rid of it if I don't do chemo and 85% chance if I do. He read the bottle of blood builder and said it was fine. He also shrugged about Claritin and said it was ok to use it but still doesn't make sense to him. I told him there were clinical trials so someone thinks it does something. He shrugged and said to take it if I want. He also said take ibuprofen or tylenol or stronger if I want and he doesn't expect me to have nausea but if I want to get ginger gravol I can. He said there is a 90% chance that I won't have it. I was surprised that I have to take 2 doses in the morning and 2 in the evening of the dexamethasone the day before chemo and 2 the morning of chemo. I think I will need extra ativan after that. So, I have the weekend to get caught up on all the tips you guys have (crappy memory so need review) and to pack up my chemo bag. I am actually more excited to get started than I am anxious.....but then I took an ativan while the blood person was struggling to find a vein for my blood work so the anxiety is drugged. :-) Thank you again for all of your wonderful support.

You have all taught me that woman with breast cancer are not only brave but so compassionate. After expressing what a hard time i was having last night I woke up with a stronger feeling that I could handle this. Even if they don't allow me to have chemo i will deal with it.

It doesn't look like a lot of research has been done on metaplastic. There was even something i read saying they think chemo used for lung cancer works better for it since it is sarcomatous. I actually thought \"oh well maybe i will get rid of this when i get treated for lung mets\" i am losing my mind and can't even blame chemo brain I actually live in a neighbourhood where there are tons of alternative medicine clinics happening and some of it is covered by my benefits. I have still been too uncomfortable or feeling vulnerable with chest wound to seek anything out. Ativan and relaxation apps help a bit. MO also says \"you may already be cured\". I had very wide margins and neg nodes. He said there is a 70 percent chance it is gone and won't be back",

I mentioned to my doc this week (because she agrees with you that i should be taking them NOW) that there will be a lot of people post treatment going to rehab and she said many develop PTSD because breast cancer is such a nightmare. We can't see that part of our colon or lung is removed but having no breasts is a constant reminder let alone just missing \"boobs\".

I then use the sink to wash the upper half that doesn't have dressing. It was an ordeal when I was still weak from surgery and would have to put drains in a baggie and hold the baggie in my teeth but now that I have no drains I still have a dressing for a wound that developed when a huge hematoma opened up my incision after I got the second drain out so I still can't get that wet but have more energy. Now it is just my routine and I don't mind. It will be heaven to just jump in the shower and do it all though. I can't wait. My case was unusual though and most just have the drains in a week or two and are fine. Even with the complications it has been a nuisance but bearable.",

You will find answers on both sides (likely tomorrow when more people are around) so you really have to think about what will work best for you. As far as recovery I had unusual complications but no pain. I used plain tylenol the day after surgery. I was surprised at how little pain there was given that I had two large breasts removed and axillary dissection.  Given that it is late on the west coast and not many around I wonder if you are in Vancouver and have Dr. U Kuusk. She is the best. I am glad things are moving quickly for you and that you found this site. I could not have managed without it when diagnosed. There are many knowledgeable women here and great support. It seems like so much information but it will fit in to place a step at a time. Ask questions as often as they come up for you. ",

I worried about that because my cancer is aggressive. But then I started reading the stories of other women here and I could see that there were so many who were worse off. That made me realize the universe hadn't singled me out to torture. I think it would help you to stick around and see that you are not alone. Ask Farmerlucy how she is doing. She has really reached out to help you and put her own concerns aside. Read about experiences of the gazillion other women in your shoes. I think it really helps. If you leave the forum you will continue to believe that this only happened to you and then you will stress. Bodies really don't heal well under stress. Stepping outside yourself is the best way to forget about what happened to you. It takes a while because a breast cancer diagnosis alone is enough to put most over the edge let alone all that goes on with surgery and treatment. There are some horror stories. I went to a breast cancer support group last night and was amazed at the bravery of the women there. I was in tears at one point because of what one woman had gone through and was still enduring. I came out of there feeling so lucky. Hope you will stick around WT. Take care.",

It looks like at least one underarm lymph node is positive but they could not see lymphovascular invasion. (Cancer travels to distant organs through lymph or blood). They are still testing hormone receptor status. To see what treatment is best. Get copies of all reports so you can go over it later.

I am so glad your husband is doing better (my sister does in home dialysis so I am hoping he gets a nurse like her). She loves her patients. I am also relieved on your behalf that you found care for you daughter. Regarding the new doctor and all that entails it seems like so much to deal with but maybe having to rethink reconstruction is not a bad idea. I watched my friends go through that and although for most it was worth it some didn't think so. I myself had a BMX without reconstruction and only needed plain tylenol the day after the surgery. I was able to do everything on my own. It is something you will have to be sure of no matter what your prognosis. I wish you peace. I am going to trust the gods that it will work out in the end but in the mean time sending you hugs. Take care.",

If someone can go with you to the appointment to take notes it would help or take notes yourself. I had double mastectomy even though only one breast involved. I would have been fine in a couple of weeks to attend a wedding but you will have to ask the surgeon about timeline and surgery planned before you can decide. I think they usually wait about 4 weeks after surgery to start chemo unless your chemo is happening before surgery. Some people breeze through chemo and others have side effects but if you time it right. Chemo is often done 3 weeks apart and there are times in those 3 weeks when side effects are minimal. It would help if you enter your information from your pathology report in the profile to get more answers here. I was 66 at diagnosis and was told that if it was genetic I (or one of my sisters) would have had breast cancer at a younger age. One sister paid to have genetic testing done anyway and she was negative. My daughter didn't qualify because of my age. I would ask your doctor what they think about that.Hopefully someone with more knowledge will be along. It is quiet here at night so you will get more answers tomorrow. Wishing for a smooth ride for you or as smooth as it can be. Take care of yourself.",

A non event as far as medical testing goes in my opinion but I am sure there will be horror stories as well since these things are different for everyone. If you are anxious you could take anti anxiety meds but I don't really think you will need pain medication.

She called an ambulance. In emerg they did a CT Scan and saw the hematoma. The drain on the left turned yellow/orange as it should but the one near the hematoma stayed red for 5 weeks and the surgeon had the nurse pull it out. I had been asking about it not turning yellow/orange and she said it was fine and to see her in a year. Two days later I felt sick and had a fever and went to emerg and about 10 minutes later blood started gushing from my incision (which had been healed but the blood from the hematoma tried to find a weak spot and the surface and burrowed a way to one end of the incision). I was on IV antibiotics and stayed in hospital for 4 days. I am still having the wound packed 7 weeks later but it is shrinking. I had an infection when the normal (yellow/orange) drain was removed too and developed celulitis so I had 3 days of IV antibiotics as an outpatient (went to emerg every day for that) and then a week of oral antibiotics. I believe yours is surface or you would have other signs and I don't know whether IV antibiotics are necessary. I fired the surgeon for ignoring my concerns about the drain and now have a new surgeon who monitors the wound. I learned from that experience to speak up. I was unhappy with my oncologist for not talking much and rushing until I sat there and just asked questions. I didn't care that he was in a hurry. I found that he was quite responsive and informative once I decided to speak up and demand answers. I wish I had done that sooner when I noticed the problem with the drain. I think you should call and talk to the receptionist and insist on a consultation. I also agree that the family doctor should initiate a treatment that he thinks is necessary as well. The decision to give me IV antibiotics was made by an oncall physician at emerg. You don't need to take the word of a doctor you are not happy with. It is sad that we are forced to do this when we are already dealing with enough but I think it's worth it to either insist on communication with surgeon or tell your PA to \"step on toes\" and treat you with what is needed. It could very well be that oral would work and it might be worth trying it but if you don't want to do that you need to speak up. I hope you find a solution. It is sad to read about what some of us have to go through but life is not fair. Let us know how you make out.",

I think in general doctors answer questions but many people don't want information and just want to do what they are told.  I think docs tend to wait for the questions.  My friend has lung cancer and gets less information than me because she doesn't want to know whereas i do.

I agree that a doctor should see it but would let them decide if a mammogram was warranted. \"mammo\" makes a lot of people think \"cancer\" and it is very unlikely that something that comes up a year apart is cancer so please don't go that route automatically. If you developed a red patch on your knee last year and again this year you wouldn't assume it was cancer of the knee and you certainly wouldn't be referred for scans. Edited to add that it is irresponsible (in my view) to suggest someone demand scans when they are clearly worried. It doesn't help to decrease the worry. ",

Your inclusion of the definition of the word follows the theme in your posts...condescension. Your posts have a scolding tone as if we are all stupid or not 'getting it'. I think the unhealthy attitudes and behaviours are when someone refuses to be open to anything that might be considered \"conventional\". It is like me stubbing my toe and blaming Obama. BTW, men get breast cancer...even the sissys. ",

If you wait until after the tumour is removed you won't have any idea whether it is doing any good. If the tumour shrinks during neoadjuvant then you will feel some pressure off regarding recurrence. Side effects from chemo can be deadly so I would want to know I wasn't taking on those effects for nothing. All the best to you.",
