Have been privately to a dermatologist as breast surgeon  didnt know what it was. I had a punch biopsy that was clear and he told me he thought that it was radio dermatitis but had no specific treatment. I have been back to rad consult and he put me on a regime of meds which helped a little. That was 6 mths ago and it has flared up again and so I hope to see him soon.  I also have lymphadema in the breast which causes me pain too. Hoping to have a custom made bra with cotton made to help with it. It just seems that nobody is certain about it and that can be scary as you depend on the \"experts\" to know! My surgeon did say to me before rads that there was more of a possibility of SEs because I was large breasted. Just wishing it would clear up so that I can try to put the cancer behind me.",
