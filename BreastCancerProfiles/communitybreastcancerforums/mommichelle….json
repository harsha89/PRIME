I try to do this every August because I remember (although more distantly) all the feeling and worries you have. I started my chemo August 2010. I remember wishing I saw more posts from the people who had been through it awhile ago. I know everyone says that once people are finished with treatment and start getting on with their lives after cancer, this site becomes a memory. Sadly, that is true. There are too many wonderful things in life to do! These boards kept me sane and feeling in touch with people who knew exactly how I felt. Hang in there...it is a long road, but doable. Keep your eyes on the prize and lean on each other when you need support. I know where you all are, and it gets so much better. If you haven't already checked out the Success Stories thread, do so! Whenever I felt down, I would log on and read some posts from that thread. There are pages of them! Thinking of you and wishing you success! Hugs! Michelle",

Cal - Thinking of you and sending lots of hope, hugs, and prayers your way.  I pray for the best news and quick, painless recovery.  Sorry about the little boogers asking you for payments.  Even though we know the financial aspect is part of everything, couldn't they do it at a more appropriate time? Libraylil - So sorry to hear the margins were not clear and you need to go again.  Prayers and tons of happy thoughts going out to you for a quick date, and sucessful surgery. Sptmm62 - Totally agree with wishing both had been taken.  I didn't know there were calcifications in the other breast until after my mastectomy.  Surgeon was not concerned about them and told me that if he performed mastectomies on all women with mammos that looked like that, most of our town would not have breasts.  Still, not reassuring enough.  I think I will be opting for another surgery to remove the other side sometime this year. :( Iowa Sue - Hope your vacation goes well.  I am so jealous!!!!  I would ask to come along in your suitcase, but with the 12 chemo pounds I put on, I am sure I wouldn't fit! Lizzy - So glad you are feeling good enough to be getting cabin fever!  Remember, not too many days ago you couldn't get out of bed.  Glad you can't wait to get out of the house! Ginger and Lady - so sorry you are both having issues getting in to see the doctors!  Ginger, is it really only three minutes?  My extra body surface area, compliments of chemo, would make getting moisturized all over a challenge, even if I started before I got out of the shower!  Gotta loose this extra weight, weather has not been helpful for getting out!  Sweeney - Hope you are having fun while the rest of us are dealing with all the snow and cold!  I am so glad you got away and sad that you will be heading home soon.  Goes fast, doesn't it? Have a great day ladies.  I think about each one of you throughout the day and pray you are all well and safe.  Once it warms up, and we are all heading outside, hopefully much of the disaster of the last 6-8 months will be behind us with happy thoughts ahead.

Been doing well, but very sad.  Lots of body aches and pains that make me worry something is going on.  Never sure if it is residual chemo stuff, herceptin, tamoxifen, old age, or the extra weight I have put on (or...cancer).  It seems like most days my neck and upper back hurt.  My side has been bothering me too.  Just not sure.  I keep reminding myself that there is a good chance it won't come back...but I feel myself just waiting for it.  I am alone in that fear?  Will we start feeling normal again?  I know there will be a new normal, but will cancer move from the forefront on my mind to somewhere in the back (or even the passenger side)?  Just wondering how many still feel rickety and are still worried.  Hate to bring it up, but I feel alone (not that I want you guys feeling this way). Hugs to all, Michelle ",

Haven't been able to read through all the posts.  I have been trying to take a little break from the boards.  I tend to work myself up into having brain mets, liver mets, or bone mets on a daily basis.  I have decided to seek some counseling to help me deal with my fear of reoccurance.  We will see if that works! Lady - so glad you are done!!!!!!!!   Lizzy - It sounds like you are having surgery soon.  Best wishes for a speedy recovery! Sweeney - I sometimes think Tamox is the devil.  I was doing alright for months, but I have to wonder how many side effects are actually linked to it!  Like the longer you are on it, the more time it has to disrupt your body.  Much like the chemo side effects that seemed to be cumulative.  I do get headaches, body stiffness and mood swings/quick temper.  It does seem to be somehow related to times in my cycle.  I am thinking about having my other breast off this fall so I will not need to take it (and for my piece of mind).  I see a surgeon Monday to discuss that and maybe some new boobs! Hope you all have a great day.  Although I think of you all often and pray we stay healthy, I am glad to not be in a place where, like last year, I needed to be here everyday.  You ladies have been an awesome support group!

Texas - I have to agree with the other ladies - you are amazing!  How lucky are your niece and nephew to have you?  Hope your transition to school days goes smoothly!  Sweeney - Sending good thoughts your way on the bone scan.  I had one at the beginning of the year for some shoulder/back pain.  It is amazing how much are bodies take going through chemo.  Lizzy - You certainly have had your fair share of troubles.  Hoping for continued recovery and a much smoother road. Sptmm - I also had the DIEP flap done in January.  I had decided after a year and a half, that I couldn't stand the thought of it coming back in the other breast.  I had to have it done.  Lizzy is right when she says how much you don't realize how much being lopsided or dealing with inserts can get to you.  I always thought I was fine being flat on one side after my mastectomy.  It wasn't until this surgery that I realized how happy I was to be able to get dressed without worrying about those inserts being in the right place, to put on a swimsuit and feel normal!  I have a 5 and 7 year old.  The surgery was tough, the weeks following were not easy, but I would never go back and change it.  I did have a lot of help from my family, but it was so worth it.  If there is anything you need, let me know.  I had been in touch via telephone with IowaSue before my surgery.  She had the procedure done too.  I would be happy to talk to you.  It is a hard decision, but you need to do what is best for you. Good day all.  Trying to get back into the school routine with my little guys too.  How they hate to get up early.  I hate waking them so early too.  Wish my work started later!  Off to rouse the monkeys! ",

Ginger - thoughts going out to you on your migraines.  I know they are not fun!  Did the doctor have any suggestions? Sweeney - It is good to hear that the doctor is going to check again in a few months.  You would certainly think if they were super worried, they would be investigating further right now.  I am sure, like so many other stories you hear, that it will be nothing.  I want to tell you to try to keep your mind off of it, but I know how difficult that can be.  Prayers and hugs!  Rachel - Glad to hear that the doctor is giving the all clear.  The abdominal pain thing stinks though.  It is always unsettling when you have random pains.  It is amazing though, how many people have pain all the time without having cancer.  Hope you are feeling better.   Felis - Hang in there!  It is a tough road but you can do it.  Hope you are feeling better and your cold is going away.  So many people have all kinds of colds right now in our area.  Debbi - When is your surgery scheduled for?  Do you have a date?  I had plenty of abdominal area for them to use.  My replacements are a little larger than the originals.  Not necessarily what I would have chosen, but they are only slighly larger.  The doctor told me he went a little bigger because you can always go back and decrease the size, harder to increase.  I just do not want any other surgeries! Hope everyone has a great day! Michelle ",

So sorry to read about insurance issues...it is a shame to have those worries now.  I hope some how, we can get this country to realize what is important.  When CEOs are bringing home multimillion dollar bonuses, we have a problem.  That is more money than most of us will see in a lifetime.  How many people could be given a job for an entire year on that \"bonus\".  It is not good enough to have companies making billions, they want to make trillions.  Cut the headcount, stress everyone out, and make more profit so we can give the presidents, CEOs millions.  Enough on that! So happy to see people finishing up their chemo treatments.  One week from today for me, with the exception of my herceptin. For those moving on to radiation, surgeries, or more chemo - be strong, you are survivors!  So thankful to LIZZYMACK1 for starting this thread.  It is wonderful to have such a great group of people to talk to, read your experiences, and know I am not alone.

Sorry to hear so many are having problems with LE.  It doesn't seem fair to go through so much only to have more to deal with.  Cal - Glad to hear that you are coming out of Tamox fog and feeling a little better.  Sorry about your oven too...I know what you mean about the money, wasn't expecting to have to buy a new computer. Texas - Been thinking about you and hoping recovery is going well.  I guess if you are running all over town, you must have pulled through with flying colors! Blessings out to everyone.  So nice to be back here.  It is hard.  I really realized how much I rely on you ladies!  Thank you for being there for me!  Have a very happy Valentine's day! ",

On aches and pains - yeah, feel like I am 85 when I try to stand up.  It seems like once I am moving all is good, but for the first couple minutes it is rough going.  Not sure if it herceptin, old age, tamoxifen, or chemo related.  The joy! Wanted to share this story, kids were pesting this weekend for me to go topless.  My son has been very shy about me being bald, so when he told me I didn't need a scarf, I thought, well maybe I don't.  The neighbor down the street asked how the hair was coming in, showed her, she said that I didn't need the scarf.  My hubby said, I think you can start going without your scarf.  Had my son's birthday party with all family this weekend and they were excited to see me without the scarf.  Co-workers said I look good without the scarf.  Day two and feeling a little more comfortable with it.  I went to pick up my son at school, rang the doorbell, and I heard a kid say, \"someone's dad is here\".  I guess the hair itself might be there, might be growing, and might look alright.....................ON A MAN! Have a great night all!",

Happy thoughts and prayers to all.  My kids are drawing on my head tonight to prepare for Halloweeen.  They have been excited since I first told them I would loose my hair to \"decorate\" me!  I can't wait!  Peace...............",

Lizzy - It has been a crazy long road to recovery for you as well.  I hope things get back to normal soon for you.  No more complications!!! Things have been good here.  Been so busy with my 4 and 6 year olds.  Soccer season is over but boy scouts and school are still here.  I have also been going to a ton of doctors appointments.  I am thinking about having the other breast removed in January with an immediate DIEP reconstruction.  Been seeing plastic surgeons and breast specialists.  I am nervous about it, but I know I need to take the other breast off for my own piece of mind.  When I had my mammogram in June this year and then when I had my very first breast MRI a few weeks ago to make sure there did not appear to be any surprises, I was a wreck.  Plus, I have been walking around lopsided for almost a year and a half.  I never got a real prosthetic and have only been using the soft form they sent me from the American Cancer Society.  I am nervous but looking forward to it.  I will feel great to put on a bra and not have to continually move my form around.  No more looking down and realizing it is up near my neck! Wanted to stop in and say hi.  Scouting for food this morning with the cub scouts and then painting the garage.  Hope you all have a good weekend.  You will all remain in my thoughts and prayers!  Hope to pop on more often!

Hugs, Michelle",

Hang in there.  Maye someone could go along to her appointments so all the information is gotten.  It can be very overwhelming.  These first weeks of scans and waiting are the hardest.  Do not get locked into any one diagnosis at this point...things unfortunately (or fortunately sometimes) change.  It is hard because you want to understand what you are dealing with and just when you think you have a grasp on it, it changes.  It will get better! Hugs to both of you, Michelle ",
