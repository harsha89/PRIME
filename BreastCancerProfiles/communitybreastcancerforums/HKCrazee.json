My scar (on the side of my breast) is feeling very hot and my nipple and aeroli is very tender and feels hard - would that be the radiation? The four days I was having the rads were absolutely fine and I wasn't even bothering to put on any cream. Next weekend is also a holiday weekend of 3 days so its 3 days or rads and 3 more days off then back to \"normal\" life Monday to Friday. I am so in awe of you ladies who have a \"long road' to go and so upbeat! Enjoy those bunnies!",

I have fair skin too and rarely go out in the sun (I live in Townsville, North Queensland, Australia) as it is too hot for me - I am concerned that I will burn too. Mine is on the left side too and they do the radiation from under and over - I also had a bit of a thought about the heart and lungs but I guess they have done it a few times before with no ill consequences.",

My BC is only small and my treatment has been / is only small too but I am so in awe of you girls who are coping so well. I must admit I didn't want to talk to anyone at first, but the more I have, the more I have spoken to such inspirational people who have gone through it - and a lot more serious than me - and lived to tell the tale!!! ETA Yes, all the rad people are young guys and girls and they are just so lovely and don't make me feel embarrased at all - the guys joke about saying their job is looking at girl's boobies all day long! Actually everyone in the Cancer centre are just so supportive - I can't praise them enough.",
