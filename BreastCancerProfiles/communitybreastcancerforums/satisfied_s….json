      "Content": "Mar 8, 2011 06:49PM - edited Mar 8, 2011 06:51PM by satisfied_survivor I had a DMX a little over a year ago.  I had implants during the intial surgery so it may have been different for me.  I felt like there was a tremendous weight on my chest for the first 4 -5  days.  I transitioned from NORCO fulltime to a triple dose of Aleve 3 times a day with half a NORCO midmorning and at bedtime on Day 7.  Ice packs brought me a lot of relief whenever I felt really uncomfortable.  It is worth a try at least.  The discomfort did taper off beginning on about day 5 and got better daily depending on how active.I was.  The more active I was,  the more discomfort I had.  Riding in the car was the worst during the first 2-3 weeks.  Carried my ice packs with me when I was riding in the car for any distance. But I was back at work fulltime at the end of 4 weeks so I think that wasn't bad considering what my body had been through.  I am not a young woman, but I do have a failry high pain threshold.",
