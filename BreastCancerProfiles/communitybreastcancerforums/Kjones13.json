This could be the case, but I take calcium supplements and pain meds, so I have the opposite problem. I have had very few side effects, if any. I have noticed a little more fatigue and a little nausea. Nothing to write home about. My best news to share is that while on just h/p (and tamoxifen and Xgeva) I have had continued regression of the liver tumors and spine tumor! Two of the tumors in the liver are now undetectible! I really hope you can get these drugs. I didn't hav any issues with my insurance for approval. Best of luck!",

I can't imagine that choice being taken away from me--to have kids. What I can identify with you is your feelings about your husband and your feelings about yourself. At an earlier point in time, I would have sabotaged my relationship to push him away for his benefit. Now, I believe that this is happening to me, my parents, my whole family for a reason. What? I don't know. I'm working on being ok with not being able to see/understand the big picture. I was a college athlete and have always thought of myself as a \"take it in stride\" kind of person. Now, I take it, hide it, put on a smile. I've done well. I've only cried like 5 times in two years...lots of good meds...but I did have a conversation with my husband. Like you, I felt like I was taking away from his life and adding misery, as he had lost his father many years ago. He told me \"I wouldn't want to be anywhere else with anyone else.\" I know he means it. That's who he is. And if the situation were reversed, I would want to be with him no matter what. You don't stop loving someone because they are sick, can't work, can't have kids...whatever the case may be. Love is so much more than that. I have met a lot of other young people with cancer. I have two people in mind that I would love to connect you with. Not sure where you are located. Please pm me and I will check with them to make sure it's ok to give you their info. I'm sure it will. And, if I could suggest something for you...apply for the couples retreat through little pink houses of hope. They will start taking applications the first of January. Go. It will be amazing! I'll be thinking about you. Hoping that peace will find you soon. You sound like an amazing, loving, kind person.",

Making sure the money goes to research. After watching Pete Frates documentary on ESPN...talk about an awful disease! There was another guy who had a video on FB...I agree with one of his statements...he feels like not much money goes towards Als research because people die from the disease...it's kind of like why put money towards something in which there is not much hope.

The first month is so incredibly crazy with appts, scans, biopsies, prep, etc. like Karyn said, once you get your treatment plan in place, you will feel like you are doing something to fight! I remember not understanding why they just didn't cut it all (the cancer) out of me. I did a lot of reading. Then I stopped and starting writing. Also, at some point, you may want to check into these non-profits...inheritance of hope and little pink houses of hope. They are similar in that they offer retreats for families, all expenses paid and all but travel paid, respectively. You don't have to be strong all the time. You want to see, hear, feel your kids true emotions and I bet they want the same from you. Please check out the Ativan and then most of us are also on some depression meds as well. Unfortunately it's how I cope. Went from never taking meds to taking a dozen or so...blah. It sucks and I'm sorry you are here. Maybe see if you can find the thread in here called \"life does not end with stage iv diagnosis--really.\" Many women have found joy and life after diagnosis. It just takes time to get adjusted. Keep us in the loop! We need to support each other.",

Not what you want me to do or where you want me to go, but if I have all the information possible, then I feel like I can make the best decision for me. Does that make sense? My father had a major heart condition when I was in high school. I was in 10th grade. He was given a 30% chance to survive. In college, especially my sophomore year, I would call home crying. Telling him I wanted to quit school and come back to be with him. He told me absolutely not. He told me I was in the best place I could be and getting my education etc. at my school was what would make him the happiest. And I know he was telling me the truth. So I stayed. He is still with me 18 years later. But that is not cancer. It's different. Just wanted to through my thoughts out there. Take them or leave them :) best of luck to both of you!!",

I am so blessed to have such a supportive family close by. Friends and people i don't even know coming out of the woodwork to help in anyway. This has been such an up and down ride so far. I have a caringbridge site. Such a great outlet for me. I try to stay positive for kids sake. Pretty sure I'm still in denial about the whole ordeal.

I have jumped through a ridiculous amount of hoops through the years spending thousands of dollars and countless hours at physical therapists, neurologists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, general drs, hospitals, gastrointerologists, hospitalists, etc you get the picture. I had to fight tooth an nail to get Ritalin two years ago so that I could get up and function and actually be a mother to my children. My oncologists office has prescribed all pain meds and all antidepressants for the past two and a half years. I went to specialists to get the right dosage/med combo but the oncologist office has always prescribed all meds. Friday, I go in for treatment just like I have every 3 weeks for the past 5 1/2 years and the PA on call will not fill my prescription because she is not \u201ccomfortable \u201c with the combination of drugs. I asked to speak with her and my oncologist nurse said no! My chemo nurses came unglued...as did I. I did get to speak to the PA and she told me her reason she doesn\u2019t feel \u201ccomfortable \u201c prescribing and says that they treat cancer. They don\u2019t treat side effects of cancer or their meds. I about lost my shit! I hate that I cry when I am mad and that\u2019s what happened. She said she would talk to my dr on Wednesday (the next time they worked together). Well I just got a call from the oncologist nurse and she told me that I will need to see a psychiatrist (even though I am in therapy) and that I will need to see a PA or LNP when I need my pain meds refilled. What the f$@*!!! ??? And who knows about the Ritalin. They question me about that EVERY single month. I am so mad right now. Trying to hold it together so I can cook supper for the fam.

They had been filling those prescriptions for me (this exact combo) for a year and a half before they took me off of tomoxifen because of the drug interaction!

I do think what you put in your body is important because it is fuel. In saying that, I do not eat as well as I should. I had a dear friend pass away recently. She was on a 80% raw foods diet. She made her own milk from nuts. She was very aware of what she put in her body. She was stage 2 in 2009. After she completed surgery and chemo she had no traditional therapy or scans. She thought that the scans could be harmful to her. She instead had a thermography test. Not sure what that is...all seemed well until early December. She was diagnosed with viral pneumonia. She broke a rib coughing. In January she was not getting better but was told it takes a long time to get over that mess. She ended up in the hospital and within three days died. Cancer had come back. She didn't do anything wrong. And who knows if the outcome would have been any different for her if she had scans. I personally think so. But I can't help but wonder about the diet as well. Was she getting enough fuel? I remember one day she was telling me about the woman who helped train her on this new diet. There was another patient who was also getting the info at the same time. My friend said \"well I heard from xxxx who told me that the other lady had passed away. She wouldn't give up eating BBQ. (Laughing) well if you don't give up foods like BBQ then you are going to die!\" My friend made that statement 6 months before she died. For me, I take away from this that cancer sucks! We can try this or that but until there is a cure, it's probably not going away. Just like we didn't \"do\" anything to get cancer...I don't think we can \"do\" anything to cure ourselves. I am so sad that cancer took my friend away.",

He is so smart but he holds everything inside. I have only seen him cry one time. He just needs me so I can hug him, hold his hand, kiss him. Because he gets no other physical contact from his dad and that side of the family. I want to see him graduate high school and pick a university. I'm so excited to see what he does with his brain!! Not to mention I would love to watch him play basketball all thru school. 3. My husband. We started dating in oct 2009. Got married sept 2010. Had daughter march 2011. We haven't had a lot of time together. Some of my friends have been married for 15 years or more (western nc)...and with the rush on having a baby, we didn't get to have enough newlywed time. He is an amazing person. God fearing, kind, generous, strong, hilarious! He has had many deaths in his family including his sister, his father, and a very dear aunt--all before he was 30. i don't want to put him through another tragedy. 4. My family--my mom, my dad, my brother and really all of my extended family also. We are close. No parent should have to bury their child. That's one thing I am \"grateful\" for--I am sick and not one of my kids. I want to see my brother get married and have kids of his own. He has been through medical hell himself. He deserves a nice family. I want to be an aunt!!!!! I'm afraid if I die, it will push my parents over the edge. They both have major heart issues and one has cancer also. 5. Friends. Travel. My animals. Horseback riding. Volleyball. Hiking and camping. I have too much to do. Sorry, can't quit....not yet. Thank you. Now I have something to remind myself on bad days :)",

I just can't seem to get on a normal sleep schedule!  James 1:2-4 Dx 9/14/2012, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 11/11 nodes, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Surgery 10/9/2012 Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel Targeted Therapy 10/17/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Targeted Therapy 10/17/2012 Perjeta (pertuzumab) Chemotherapy 10/17/2012 Taxol (paclitaxel) Hormonal Therapy 3/1/2013 Surgery 10/24/2013 Mastectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",

I worked for the state before bc (so bcbs for state employees) and that insurance is secondary. For me, that works well. It pays the 20% after Medicare and has decent drug coverage. Before Medicare, I was paying between $12-15,000 a year out of pocket on medical expenses. Huge difference this year (haven't tallied it up yet). Just my story",

When I started taking Xgeva I asked what I can and can't do because I knew something would come up eventually. My onc said no extractions. So when my dentist sent me to the endodontist yesterday I decided to go ahead with the root canal without consulting my onc. Both dentists were aware of my situation and I felt like I couldn't very well let the infection in my tooth get worse. I don't know. Maybe that was stupid of me, but I made the decision that made the most sense to me. They will hold the Xgeva for 30 days and then I'll be back on track. Hopefully no harm done.

These pictures were taken at the Biltmore House in Asheville, NC. It is the largest private home in the country. Of course no one lives there now. It is open to the public. The house and priceless antiques in the house are astounding. The grounds are immaculate. At one point the Vanderbilts owned most of three counties. They donated their land to the government and it is now protected national forest. They actually were the pioneers of the (national) forest service. The first forestry building was air lifted from the estate and flown two counties away to a place now called the Cradle of Forestry. It's just a fascinating story. Google it if you want to see more (I can't figure out how to download pics from the internet). You haven't checked in for a couple days. I hope you are resting easy, comfortable, pain free, and at peace. Much love. Kristin ",

It seemed to work  for about a year and then after a surgery I had, I went rock bottom. I am currently taking 10mg lexapro and 125mg of Wellbutrin. The combo is great. I have energy and I can cry!

What I mean is, when someone you love dies, there is a sense of the world going by, other people are moving on with their lives, and you are stuck in your grief. Your world seems to have stopped and it's easy to get stuck there...even for years. I would think death affects older kids more. The younger ones seem more confused by it more than anything. I have talked to two of my friends who lost their mother when they were in 2nd grade and 6th grade. They older one said she remembered her dad and her aunt sitting them down to explain what was happening (at the end). She was glad her mother was at home and she was able to say goodbye. But she said after her mother's death it was all very confusing and her dad was not really the talking type. She also said she wished her mom would have left something for her, like a note. I was a school counselor at a high school before I went out on disabity. I really should break out my books and re-read a lot of stuff. It seems to hit home now. I also have so much guilt because, unfortunately there were close to 10 kids at the school, maybe more, that I knew lost a parent in the last couple years...and I did nothing. I mean I had one on one sessions if they were referred to me, but I didn't reach out! I could have started a group...why didn't I do more for them?! Like how I would want someone to treat my kids... I seem to shut down when I get over whelmed. Which makes things worse because then nothing gets done and just puts more stress on me and my dh. I want to be organized. I want things to be a certain way. I have been able to still do a lot with my kids, unless I feel really lousy and then I just try to lie in bed with them and cuddle and talk and hope that is enough. For the most part, I have been feeling better, physically, since January. I have three vacations set for this year. I hope to do a lot of little vacations too...my dh worries about how much money we are spending and I just tell him it's fine! Just want to cram as much good stuff in while I feel good, no matter the cost! I am just rambling...really putting off cleaning my room...how old am I?",

I am not in your situation so I don't know if this is helpful or not--are you on soc sec disability? I am on that and on short-term disability from work. For this time frame that the state( my employer) has said that I am disabled, the two monies are seperate. Therefore I am making almost what I was while working. Another thought, do you have life insurance? You can get (crap my mind is not working and I am forgetting the correct terminology) accelerated death benefits with some plans. Maybe check with the American cancer society to see if they have any aid available? And then with my hospital bills, they are more than happy to set up a payment plan...like $20 a month, I guess depending on what is owed. Actually my brother is an expert in this area...he lost his job because he was completely disabled by a disease but yet soc sec kept denying him. He didn't pay his mortgage for over a year. Stopped paying credit card bills...of course he got rid of any extra things like tv phone etc. I'll see if I can get info from him on how he got out of the mess...because he has and is doing great!

Most people say that taxol is an easier chemo...I don't have anything to compare it to, but it got harder as time went on. The side effects were cumulative. The se's for me (if I can remember)--Fatigue, lots of diarrhea, neuropathy, runny nose, loss of hair, nausea, decreased white blood cells (I had neupogen shots that had their own set of se's), dizziness and weakness. I would suggest lots of water. I drank constantly. Do some kind of exercise everyday. Just a thought: I am in the live strong program at my YMCA. If I had known about it during treatment, I would have done it then. The exercise and support group is amazing! There are also supplements you can take to help with the neuropathy. If you get a chance, read up on the cleopatra trial. That is where this combo came from. Pretty amazing results! Stay strong. Easy to say...really hard to do. You will have highs and lows. Feel every feeling and then move on. Oh...and I'm on Wellbutrin and lexapro to help me out!!! Sending you lots of good vibes!",

I know I was as honest as I could be and I have always said that he will be the first one to know when anything with my health changes. He has always been the kid who likes to know things in advance. He doesn\u2019t like surprises. He likes to have a plan. My daughter, on the other hand. Can\u2019t handle being told anything ahead of time because she obsesses over every detail. Will have to write more later. Phone is being at",

That would be easy and I can sit in the floor and take my time.\" Instead I went to bed. Slept for 3 hrs. Up now. Cleaning their rooms? Nope. Sitting on the couch watching ncis. The couch is notably sunk in where my butt resides. I have so much to do around the house. I want to. I want a clean house for my kids and husband. Yet here I sit. I have a horse who is boarded on 10 minutes from my house. I have loved horses my whole life. I love my boy. How many times have I ridden him? Once in over a year. Riding requires a lot from my body, but I could do ground work with him or just go spend time with him...here I sit. For me, I'm not even sure if it is an energy issue. Sometimes, but not always. It's like I talk myself out of things. If that makes sense? I too have been searching for purpose. I am not going back to work. I just can't see myself sitting on this couch doing nothing!! Well, I can see it, but that is not what I want. My job was rewarding. I want to work part-time or volunteer...not sure what is holding me back. What am I waiting for? I do enjoy my time with my husband and kids. I don't participate in everything, but I am trying to do better in that area too. I went to a different church yesterday with one of my best friends and her family. I haven't been to church since last October. It is kind of freaky how the message seemed to fit. We all have a cross to bare. We can deny it or we can carry it. I think, for me, I needed to hear that. Yes I have stage 4 cancer at age 36 with two young children. Does it suck? Yes! Is it unfair? Yes! But...right now, at this point in time, I am better off than a lot of others. I thank God that I am the one with cancer and not my children! Maybe I just need a good quick kick in the butt! I hope I don't offend anyone. I believe in everyone's right to worship or not. But for me...maybe going back to church is a good first step. Thanks raro for saying what so many of us are thinking!

The people before us had planted many dogwoods, but way too close together. In the back yard there were several trees and huge bushes completely out of control. I was dx a month after moving in. We were very blessed to have my family and friends come to the rescue! We had to cut down dogwoods so the others would survive. We had to take out everything in the front of the house and replant. In the back we had to cut down trees (that were rotted and would have fallen into the house!). And then there was the wisteria. I had never heard of it. My dad is retired us Forrest service... A tree Doctor :) we cut and pulled and cut on that invasive vine! To our surprise we found a basketball goal intertwined and completely hidden from sight! It almost killed all of our pine trees! We have been able to keep it under control but we have to stay on top of it! I went to the biltmore house one spring day to stroll through the gardens and saw wisteria! They had it wound they huge trellises (I don't know how to spell that). Anyway, it was gorgeous and smelled so good! I can see why people thought it would be nice to introduce in America...but I guess they had no idea how invasive it was! Let me see if I can find a picture from the biltmore estate. ",

Depression--thank you stage 4 diagnosis Runny nose--the damn thing drips before I can get a tissue! Annoying but manageable. Neuropathy--got it with my taxol. Not sure if it's just left over or what?

I have three liver mets and they have shrunk to mm's and been stable for almost a year. But I have noticed recently that I have a spot below my rib cage that is very sore to the touch. I think I remember someone saying on here that they were able to point out their liver met too. I was hoping to get a scan now as I'm not due for one until end of February.

For me, they did a ct or ultrasound (I can't remember now) guided biopsy. They drug you up pretty good. I was kind of in and out. It is uncomfortable. Would not want to do it again, but I made it through fine. I also had my node biopsy and port put in at the same hospital visit, so I'm not really sure what after pains I had...not sure what I can attribute it to.

Since the end of taxol in feb 2013, I have been scanned every 3 months. 2 of 3 liver spots are not longer detectable and the 1 may be scar tissue!

I was expecting to feel so much better after I was done with taxol. Which I did, a little. My first thought is that it sounds like depression...I talked to my onc and pa's about it from the time I finished taxol (feb 2013) until December. I finally decided to go to my family doc. She put me on 10mg of lexapro at night and 150mg of Wellbutrin in the morning. I finally feel like I have my life back! I hope the doctors will work with you. They kept telling me \"it just takes time.\" I agree, but 10 months of it was enough! I have a 9 yr old and 3 yr old I need to take care of! Best of luck.

That being said, I think my husband would find me more appealing if I did have the surgery. He has never said one way or another and he never will because he is awesome. I just have noticed little clues like he doesn't take my shirt off anymore while we are messing around. He doesn't look at me when I get undressed to get in the shower. Maybe I am reading him wrong. We have been through so much hell these last 18+ months. I know he is tired, frustrated with my health, etc. I feel like he deserves to at least have some boobs to play with with all that I have put him through! :) I'm 35 so I'm not ready to give up on my sex life just yet.

I can't imagine how hard all of this must be for you all physically and mentally. I think Lego have some great suggestions that were helpful to her mom. Another thing I thought of was scent...is there a fragrance that is soothing to her? I love lavender. Whenever is smell it, I calm down. Maybe something from a spa? Again, thank you!

I agree that if you want to write letters or scrapbook, it's better to do it when you feel good. When you are given the \"you have 6 months to live\" speech, you may not be able to do it then. I should speak for myself...I am going to try to carve out one day a week where I work on things for the kids. I have put it off because it's too hard to go there emotionally...I'm just going to have to change my way of thinking to make it fun. I remember as a kid that I felt like my parents didn't tell me things to protect me and that made me so angry! But, as an adult, I know now the \"secrets\" and I am so very thankful...amazed...not sure of the right word...for what my parents did to keep our family together and as \"normal\" as possible. That is an incredibly selfish statement. But, now I understand why my mom made the decisions that she did. She put us kids before herself. And I want to do the same for my kids. I just don't know how to balance the normal childhood with my very not normal health. I can only hide so much. I am actually starting a little part time job with inheritance of hope. In the coming months I will be gathering some information that I will share here too.  I remember the moment the dr put my oldest on my chest after birth...I never knew I could love someone so much at first sight! I will never let go of that feeling.",

I truly believe with my whole heart that God gave me Cora to help me through the bad times. She brings me so much joy and laughter! She is hilarious! The bad thing is she knows she's funny...so we are working on not laughing at her all the time. My son will be 11 in may. He just finished youth league basketball. For the first time ever his team was undefeated! He was so proud. And I think he is finally starting to understand the game. I am going to be his coach next year. I might as well. And then I won't have to bite my lip at all the stupid things his coach says and does! They got lucky and had very good players on their team. I do keep my mouth shut in front of my son because I don't want to undermine authority. Cole is a different kid. He can be shy and quiet which can come across as rude. He has come a long way! He is the brains of the family. Seriously has an iq about 15 points higher than mine. What I'm most impressed with is how he keeps up with everything going between 3 houses--mine, his dad's, and grandparents. He keeps up with all his school work, organized! I hope that continues. He has all a's at this midterm. He is so sweet. He's my cuddle buddy! And for the most part he is super sweet to his sister! I'm also planning a little surprise party for my hubby...turning the big 40! I hope it all comes together. You all have such a special place in my heart. Prayers to you and yours!",

I have heard of cancer patients using it for more energy. I need it!! Another thought that crossed my mind when reading your post--I think back to my childhood, which was near perfection, and my parents really didn't play with me very much. And that didn't seem weird to me at the time. They were/are great parents. But nowadays, parents seem to always play with their kids. I do or did or I try to. But I also think it's ok for them to play by themselves. IMO. I just get a weird feeling about all the pressure there seems to be around this issue. I think doing something special every now and then is more meaningful. My favorite times with my kids are when we are laying in bed talking and cuddling and reading books. That is when I feel closest to them.",

I could do a little every day...that's not really enough of a challenge though. I have to wait until I can't carry the basket downstairs. Then I have to wait for my husband to carry it down for me...it's a ridiculous amount if laundry to do at once. Then I have two couches in the den which hold the clean clothes. Lately the clothes don't even make it back upstairs into the drawers. Everyone just gets dressed downstairs! Pathetic. I have a super sweet lady who cleans my house. I was using her twice a week. Then it pushed back to once a month and now it's just whenever I remember. And the bad part is I don't really do anything between her cleanings. I did end up having to clean all 2 1/2 bathrooms a couple weeks ago when my daughter had a stomach virus. My other shame is shaving. I am my husbands 3rd wife. His previous ones were very girly and prissy and cared about their appearance...me...not so much. Bless his heart. What you see is what you get. I can't remember the last time I wore make-up. Although having a date night with him does sound like fun and I would probably at least shave under my arms. Edited to say--not twice a week! What a freak! Every two weeks...",

Not only do you get to make memories with your children, but there is also counseling groups and an opportunity to make a legacy video. 2. Little Pink Houses of Hope--they serve families with breast cancer, any stage. They also send families on retreats (mainly east coast destinations). Everything is paid for except transportation. There is no counseling aspect to this retreat. They also offer couples retreats. If you have questions you can pm me. I went to Orlando in may of last year with inheritance of hope. Changed my life. My husband and I will be going to St. John USVI this may for a couples retreat.  Sometimes, I think they kids feel just as isolated as the parents. That's what I appreciated about the retreat mentioned above. My son was with other kids going through the exact same situation. Luckily, one of those kids is close by, so they can hang out!

I will give you the info and you can tweak it however you see fit to use with your child. 1. Draw a picture of \"me and my family\" 2. Changes in my home: when someone in a house is sick, changes happen. What has changed in your house? Has any room changed a lot? Draw the rooms that have changed and explain what is different. 3. Color you heart: pick at least 5 colors that match different feelings you have right now in your heart. Use the key to match a color to a feeling (just have a red dot for angry or whatever). The. Color in the heart to show how much of each feeling is in your heart (my son used percentages). 4. Sickness feels like a swamp: when someone you love is sick for a long time, it can feel like the whole family is in a swamp. And though you might wish you could fly over the swamp, sometimes you just have to wade through it. Let's build a swamp together, and think about some good things (there might be islands or stepping stones and other people in the swamp with you to help) and some bad things (goop, snakes, quicksand, stinky slime) that happen when you're in a swamp.--this was an actual physical activity where they drew a swamp and glued stuff on it... 5. Worry yarn stories: sometimes it feels like we have lots of worries tangled up inside us. Some worries are little and some are big. If we have some yarn, we can show each other how long each worry is, and then we can show how they get tangles up together. But as we talk, we all get a better understanding of what's inside us. And we can help each other think of ways to handle anxiety.--I'm sure they probably used yarn for this, but my son also drew like a line graph on paper of each of his worries...he worried about his sister's life about 2 inches and state end of grade tests about 6 inches haha! Ok I'm going to post now so I don't lose it. I will finish tomorrow.",

I feel like my family can't catch a break. There are 6 of us who have major medical conditions. It's too much sometimes. I have mixed feelings about my grandparents. This may be totally selfish, but in a way, I think they would say the same thing...they have lived their life. A long life. Don't dwell on them. But then I think of my own end of life issues. I want to honor their wishes just like I hope my family will honor and respect mine. Don't know if this makes any sense.",

You just do the best you can, and that's all you can do. When I was going trough taxol, my friend and her mother got me a housekeeper for twice a month. It was a huge help. Although I had to clean before they came, they did all the heavy duty stuff. I have kept her. Not on a regular basis, but as needed. My grandfather pays for her now. He doesn't want me over doing it. So very sweet. In my area there is a resource for free house cleaning and such for cancer patients. Maybe a social worker at you facility can look for something for you? In the grand scheme of things, it's not a huge deal if the house is 't clean. But having that done for you might give you a little boost to do the other stuff you want to? I don't know. I sure am glad you are feeling a little more energy this school year. Just one day at a time. Be kind to yourself :)",

I can get up in the mornings and do stuff. I do have to take breaks but I can do stuff and keep up with the kids for the most part. They are pretty easy. They are what keeps me going. It makes me feel so good when I pick them up from school and they are so excited to see me! I know some of my friends and family probably wonder why I don't keep my 3 yr old at home...she goes to preschool. I feel that that is the only way I am able to keep up with them when they get out of school. I feel guilty though. Like maybe I'm waisting my time away with her. I should be with her every second I can. I want that. I really do. I don't think I would be able to function and take care of my whole family if I did that though. I really want to go sneak into her room right now and cuddle with her! I am also enjoying my time with close friends. Lunches mainly. And a few of my friends are having babies so I love to go and hold them and give the mommas a break! I love babies. I am just really thankful that it is me that is sick and not my children. I can't handle children being sick. I think I do need to take some time for myself and do things I want to do and forget about cleaning the house etc. like spending time with my horse. Hiking with my dad. Shopping with my mom. I also just want to get out and do activities. Try new things. Travel. Pretty much seeing the smile on my kids faces will make all right in the world! Be kind to yourselves. Your body and mind are going through a lot. Your children love you and they just want to spend time with you. If cuddles and watching movies is what you can do, great! If you need to rest while they are home, rest. You have to take care of yourself first...they love you anyway! ",

So, now that I'm done with taxol, I have so much more energy, which is great! I've been able to do so much more. It always seems like i have some complaint...so now it's my muscles!

My husband and I have been round and round for the last four years. We haven't talked about divorce but I'm sure it has crossed both of our minds at some point. With stage 4 cancer....everything is stressful! Finances, work/no work, laundry, cleaning, fatigue, emotions, friendships...the list is long. In the beginning, My husband did not handle things the way I thought he should. I tend to do this often. He didn't read up on things like my dx and treatment options...etc. he was very understanding and tremendously helpful with the kids and the house during taxol. Once I dropped that, I guess he thought I should go back to normal. We have both struggled mostly with my fatigue and depression. I have thought to myself, if I leave him now, the pain for him will be less. And the kids too. They can go on with life and not have to watch my die slowly. Not sure if that makes any sense whatsoever. One thing I would suggest...as the patient, we get all of the attention and support. We (usually and not always the case) have an army. I imagine being the caregiver is way more difficult! My dh has had no one to talk to. No one in a similar situation. Until recently. An old coach of his insisted they start meeting every Monday before school and talk. It has made a HUGE difference! He even asked me questions about my treatments and apologized for not being more vocal and supportive (for the last 4 years). I told him that it was ok. I have lots of people to talk to about cancer. I just need you to be my dh and a father. He hasn't been super involved because he can't stand to think about our situation much less talk about it with me. I'm not sure what the issues are in your marriage. Just giving you my thoughts/experience. Would your dh consider counseling for himself or with you? Guy's usually aren't very willing to go to therapy. They are fixers and our dh's can't fix this so they are kind of lost. So sorry for all you are going through",

They were more concerned with playing with the other kids. I would say a lot of the sick parents were much like us...fighting like heck to stay alive and function as best they can while looking relatively \"normal.\" I did have a talk with my 8 yr old at the time and gave him a heads up that other parents there would be sick an some may be in wheelchairs, etc. also, I asked the organization how the counseling sessions would go because my son knows people can die from cancer but he doesn't know the full extent of my diagnosis. They do not say--you parent has a life-threatening illness how are you coping? They have activities on how to release stress. They have a workbook. It's all about the kids. This info is re: inheritance of hope retreat.  Little pink houses of hope, I don't know. I do know that they try to take breast cancer patients who are in treatment or very recently done with it. So maybe some bald heads there. But they take any stage of bc. So may have a harder time relating to lower stages?",

We played and worked outside all day!  I had an interesting conversation with my ex-mother-in-law, who I love and we are very close. I can't remember what was said to bring it up but for the first time she told me how she felt about her son, as a father. My 9 year old is from that marriage. She said that she doesn't know what they do together if anything at all. And if were up to him, he wouldn't have cole play sports because it's an inconvienance to him. That's the first time she has said anything about her son to me. I try to avoid talking about him because I really have anything nice to say and I don't want to put her in the middle. I  concerned though. Cole has been missing his dad recently...enough that he has vocalized it and cried a couple of times. His dad and I split time, but cole is with me a little bit more...his dad works out of town so... I tried to talk to his dad and tell him that cole wants to spend time with him and he just makes excuses or says nothing! And this is the man that will have full custody of my son when I die??!!! Cole is such a sweet, fun, loving, and brilliant child! I just don't understand his dad...but that's why I am not with him.  I would much rather have my ex-in-laws have custody because I know they would take care of him and love him like he deserves! Or have my now husband keep him on the same schedule we have now...which cole's dad would probably go for. He is remarried and I really like her a lot! I think she is more invested than he is. Breaks my heart and makes me more determined to keep on keepin on!",

She had a blog called \"mundane faithfulness.\" She was a Christian. She made her name known when she wrote a letter to Brittany Maynard. I don't want to start a discussion on that. Kara was diagnosed around the same time I was. She died yesterday, leaving behind her husband and 4 children. Something she said resonated with me--it's like I'm at a party and my father is trying to get me to leave and I'm throwing a tantrum...I'm not afraid of dying...I'm just not ready to go. That may not be verbatim but close. I was in tears because, for me, that describes my feelings to a tee. Also, I have mentioned before the non-profit inheritance of hope that sent my family to Disney. There was a young man with his ex-girl and daughter. They happened to be in my counseling group...the one where we tell a bit about our cancer experience. I remember him being very uncomfortable. He said he didn't belong there because everyone else had it so much worse. Well he died today. And this is just unbelievable...his ex-girl, mother of his child, she must have remarried and had another child who is around two. That man ALSO passed away two weeks ago! Wth?!? I'm sorry to vent here. I just can't even process bad news anymore. I didn't think about having \"relationships\" with terminally ill people...it affects me greatly the losses here and with others from these non-profits. It brings it closer to home. It's not just somebody out there dying, it's tangible people I know. Now this may be craziness, but all this senseless death makes me think--why her? Why him? Why not me? Some type of survivors guilt I guess. Why do some fly thru treatment options and the cancer keeps taking over? Why do some live with Ned for 7 years? It makes no sense...and if I weren't so sad, I would be mad.",

I took some time during our trip to do/feel/be purposeful. This picture of me gives me peace. I hope that is what your trip did for you.  You have been through so much already. I think it's great you know what you don't want to do (tax). I hope whatever is next will get you to a place of stability. Prayers for you",

I've always heard port placement was just the surgeons decision. At my cancer center they are all surgical oncologists, so my dr put mine in. He likes them higher up centered between neck and shoulder. I've noticed some women who seem to have it way far down. Like where the boob is! I try not to stare but it seems strange that there are that many places to stick that thing! I have to agree with some others; I love my port. I'm a chunky girl so it can hide easily.  You can't see the entire \"tail\" but you can see the vein it goes up because it protrudes more than the other veins in my neck. Will be thinking of you patty!! ((Hugs))",

Would hate for all that money to be tied up in education and they take a different route! I just want them to be happy and to love learning! I can't remember--were you going on an Inheritance of Hope retreat? Running events is their main fundraiser. Glad you and your son have the running in comman. That is awesome! Romansma--so glad you got to have the talk...at 10! Wow, you are good! I would be fumbling my words! What a great foundation you are laying for him. Sorry to hear that your daughter has to fear any of this. Glad she is going for check-ups. Praying that the biopsies show benign! Torridon--so so sorry you are here. Cancer sucks! Your son sounds like a great little man. It is all very upsetting and not fair at all. What is your treatment plan? It takes a while, but things calm down. You will adjust to your new normal. Sounds like you have a great hubby to support you. Just enjoy that little boy! We will be here to support you. Shazzakelly--I have kept up with you on the taxol thread...wow what a run you have had! Your daughter sounds amazing! What a sweetheart for taking such good care of you! I'm not too surprised about your boys taking it so hard. I hate that the oldest has kind of shut down. Would he be open to some counseling? Maybe family counseling? I'm sure they were all terrified last year when they thought they were going to lose you! I would be traumatized from that for sure! Thanks for joining in! Wildrumara--there are lots of treatments, but hearing that doesn't automatically make you feel better and everything ok. It sucks. And it's scary. We just have to help each other through. One day at a time. Well I'm up because my 3yr old daughter threw up in her bed. I hate throw up! But luckily my mommie instincts take over and I just do it! But I'm terrified that it's norovirus and that I'll get it and miss treatment and miss my colonoscopy and upper endoscopy Tuesday! How freaking selfish is that!?!? Thankfully her daddy is taking care of her now, but just pisses me off that I even have to think about anything other than taking care if her! Stupid cancer! ***carolsue63--I missed you! So sorry! You are right. New treatments coming along all the time. It really is amazing. I've been at this now for 19 months, stage 4 from get go. I'm on perjeta which is a new drug...I've been stable and even had some periods if regression over the last year!!  I think for you newer girls, the boards can be a godsend or it can be doom and gloom. What I mean is that there are women on here who have been disease free for 5+ years and then there are women who are really struggling and preparing for the end. Just last week, we lost three women. It's heartbreaking! Sometimes people have to take a break from the boards because it's just too much sadness (again I'll speak for myself). I had to take a break last summer. 1--I wanted to spend all my time with my kids while they were on break. 2--I was having a hard time processing my own stuff and didn't have room to take in more info especially super sad stuff. Selfish? Maybe but I needed that time to focus on me and my family. Don't know if this is making sense.",

I don't necissarily think that you have to wait until your child is visibly not handling things well to seek outside help. They can do a pretty good job putting on a good face (just like us). I don't think it would hurt to let him/her talk things out. The school counselor should know some local counselors. Also, if you have a place of worship, maybe a pastor may know of some outside resources as well.  So glad we are here to support each other. Milestones or hardships...love to you all!",

Hopefully you will find these boards to be a wealth of knowledge and support. It's never easy telling children. I think them crying is perfectly normal...no matter how well you prepared. There will probably be more of that too. It's painful to see, I'm sure. When you get a treatment plan in place, things will settle down.

One, he wouldn't want me to see him suffer. Two, he values education more than anything else. That may not be the case for everyone. I know you two are very close. You cannot dismiss how he is feeling. Maybe it's time for some extra support for him. Does his school have a good counselor or social worker! Look for \"LPC\" or \"LCSW\" after their name. If not, the school may have a contract with an outside agency in which a therapist comes to school a couple times a week to see clients. Ask the school counselor for a referral. I know this is breaking your heart. I am so sorry you are in so much physical pain and emotional pain. Know that I am praying for you guy's. keep us updated, if you can. Sending love!",

Hopefully removing that original tumor does the trick. Glad it won't get you, but that doesn't make it any easier. I think you are right by going to the people in the school. They spend more time with the kids during the week than parents do. They will keep a look out and probably give some extra special hugs. I do a lot of faking things around my kids. The things we do to try to keep their world as normal as possible. Sending lots of love, hugs, and healing vibes your way.",

They get paid to see patients on a scheduled basis...school counselors are not able to serve students in this way for many reasons. I also think that a group of peers in similar situations would be beneficial. There is an organization called inheritance of hope. They serve families who have a parent with a life threatening illness by sending the family on an all expense paid trip to Disney world or New York City. Around16 families attend. During the retreat, families are broken up into counseling groups based on age--adults, older teens, middle teens, elementary age, and toddlers/babies. A counselor has designed a program for each level of children to work through their challenges. What I appreciated about this group time was that the counselors did not say \" your mother's terminal illness...\" They just let the kids explore what is different now about their lives and they process that with others their age going through similar situations. And you are creating awesome memories at Disney! Just my thoughts...good luck to you. You will know what is best for your son.",

For me, I had biopsy of liver o confirm mets. The spine was weird. My mo did send me for a biopsy but it came back negative. The spot was on the inside next to the spinal column. So we think the doc doing the biopsy may not have gotten to it. The spot has responded to treatment so my mo does think it's cancer. Not sure though in your case that a biopsy was needed. Were they supposed to cut you in every spot you lit up? That's craziness. The scans showing a response to treatment should be enough \"evidence,\" right? How frustrating",

I'm going to see a psychiatric nurse practitioner tomorrow...my depression has kept me from living these last 4-5 months...and I'm 2 1/2 yrs out. There is no taking it one day at a time...but yet we do, physically at least. Why would God do this to us? I don't know. I must admit I never really went thru the why me thing. Maybe I was too doped up on new depression meds and had no feelings whatsoever. I'm not sure if you know about Kara tippets. She had a Christian blog called mundane faithfulness. She passed away a few days ago. Her spiritual journey thru cancer was unbelievable to me. I am not her. I do not feel driven more towards faith, God, because of cancer. I do feel that I am still here for a reason. This dx is life changing. It takes your world and everything you thought you knew to be true and says--nope! Let's shake things up a bit! I had this revelation in 2001 when I was a bank teller. A guy came up behind me with a gun and forced me in the back door (I was opening the branch). So me and the gunman chilled in the vault together while I helped him back his bags full of money. He ran off. The police caught him. Justice as served. But for me...I was a wreck! I was totally traumatized at 21 yrs old. And every person I talked to for the next five years heard about my incident. I told it over and over again. Until one day, I didn't. That incident no longer defined me. Now, I wish I could say I have wizened up in the last 15 years...no. Although this time, with cancer, it didn't take me 5 years. I still talk about cancer everyday. I think about every hour. I don't know how to move on from here. I would love to be one of those people who can live moment to moment. I have done that some. With my crazy kids who can be quite a distraction. But cancer never leaves me. For me, I do find comfort in the many, many people who are praying for me. Why did God choose me? I don't know, but I will one day.",

The co-founder Kristen Milligan, wrote a book called \"pure joy.\" For me, the book came at a point in my cancer journey when I needed it the most. I didn't get to meet Kristen because she passed away last October from a 10 year battle with liver cancer. Her husband, deric was at the retreat and sometimes their 3 children come along. Not trying to toot my own horn, but at the retreat I realized that my new job was to help pay it forward. Earlier this month I raised over $6600 for IOH! Just felt so strongly about being able to help another family like mine! Tarheelmichelle, I hope your whole family gets to attend and that you make life long friends/supporters!",
