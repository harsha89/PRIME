I feel guilty about worrying about my health when I have an 80 percent chance that it is not malignant and you both have been through actual breast cancer. I am going to try to put this out of my head until I get the results. I knew the lips thing was silly. I have a new respect for any woman that has battled bc. I can honestly say that I never really empathized with a survivor before. That is terrible and I'm not proud to admit that",

Remember that 80 percent of the biopsies are malignant. I keep reminding myself that. The odds are totally in our favor. Ask your doc to prescribe something for your nerves the day of your biopsy. It really helped my nerves today. I just have to get through tomorrow and then I will know",
