In 2012, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my left breast. I had a lumpectomy and radiation. In Oct 2016, I was diagnosed again, in the same breast! I just underwent a double mastectomy with tissue expanders on 12/14/16. My plastic surgeon was concerned about the radiated skin and previous scars. He said I would be at a higher risk of the skin dying and longer heal time, but \"we would see how it goes.\" I've gone to him weekly for expansion & check ups and he is in shock at how well I've done. He said I'm out of the woods for the skin dying & the major complications! He even scheduled my exchange surgery.",
