So how do I choose the right color and fix the one I've got?  I wanted it to be a more golden blonde than reddish blonde. I bought a temporary \"Ash Blonde\" color that I'm going to try in a couple of weeks.  I just want to get some of the red out.

Do your best to research the different chemotherapy drugs.  A site I found useful for looking up the different drugs (any prescription drug) was: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginformation.html Make sure you understand all of the side effects - short term as well as any possible long term effects.  Weigh those against the benefits you would get. Once you've done some research on your own, if you need to, meet with your onco again.  Or get a 2nd or 3rd opinion. Good-luck with your decision.",

Organs and bones clean but lots of lymph node involvement and nasty frustrating skin mets. Been on every chemotherapy out there including hormone blockers xeloda tykerb faslodex you name it and I have been on it. Even have done drugs twice. In July I felt very scared skin mets out of control and running out of options. Searching clinical trials I did all the research on TDM1 and I felt this is the drug I need to be on. My onc did not agree and said I was not a candidate. I emailed all the sites with my story and sure enough got an appt. In Fairfax Va cancer center. I live in N.Y. But trial was not offered here. After a ton of tests and 3weeks of no treatment they let me in the trial. Not a blind study the expanded access trial. So I knew I was getting the real thing. I did six cycles in Va. After six cycles and a much improved pet and healing skin mets, they allowed me to transition to Sloan Kettering in N.Y. I just finished my 2nd cycle here at Sloan and another good scan. Skin mets not gone but under control. I have felt better in the last six months than I have in 6 years. I have not a side effect. nothing! My labs are all great and my energy level is like new. I feel so blessed to be on TDM1 and pray it works for a very long time! We really have to be our own advocates when it comes to this horrible disease. This drug needs to be approved! I started this trial in Aug and they closed it in sept. I just made it, but I definitely fought to get it! Peace to all!",

So far, I still have my eyebrows and eyelashes.  You should check to see if there's a Look Good Feel Better class in your area.  The class was fun for meeting other women undergoing chemotherapy and learning to apply make-up to give the look of eyelashes and eyebrows.",

A friend at work cousins daughter, 11 years old, was diagnosed with bone cancer in her knee earlier this year.  She had been getting chemo at Memorial Sloan Kettering in NYC.  Last I heard they weren't sure if they would be able to give her a knee replacement or if they would have to amputate her leg.  It's very sad when cancer strikes anyone, but particularly the very young. Too bad you can't go to a radiologist that you like.  Especially since you have to seem them so often.",

Does your boss have a hard time with people working from home in general?  I think some people do and don't trust that people get as much done working from home.  I think most people get MORE done working from home as there are fewer interruptions, etc.",

We had lots of rain this past week so all the leaves on our big oak trees came down all at once.  The yard was covered with brown leaves so thick that I couldn't see the grass underneath.  So yesterday was spent cleaning up the leaves.  I even went up on the roof with a leaf blower to blow the leaves off the roof.

Last year, my Mom was diagnosed with Uterine Cancer.  She had a hysterectomy.  It turned out to be a rare cancer called Leiomyosarcoma.  She then underwent Radiation Therapy to her abdomen.  She recently had a CAT scan which showed some spots on her lungs.  She had a biopsy done and 1 turned out to be benign and the other the leiomyosarcoma.  They cannot do surgery as the spots are spread in different areas in both lungs.  The Oncologist said they cannot cure it, but can treat it with Gemzar and Taxotere.  So she will be starting Chemo on Tuesday.  We'll be going Wig shopping on Saturday.  I'm taking her to the store where I got mine. It sounds like she'll need to be on chemo forever - but they will give her breaks.  They will do a few rounds then repeat the CAT scan and see if there are any changes.  I hope it works as this is an aggressive cancer.",

My hair is continuing to fall out.  I'm amazed at how much hair I find in the drain after a shower.  Yet I look at my head and there's a lot left to go.  It just looks thinner.  I think I'm actually looking forward to when it's all out so there won't be any more shedding. Funny story.  My husband and I went on a diet in December and have lost a lot of weight.  So I'm much thinner these days.  Last night we went food shopping and I was wearing my new wig.  I went off to a different aisle in the store to look for something.  I guess I was gone quite a while so my husband started looking for me.  He went past the aisle I was in because he didn't recognize me!  When he looked up the aisle, he saw a thin blonde woman.  He did find me on the second round and we both had a good laugh.",

Then there are about 20 or so private rooms.  Each of these rooms has a comfy chair for the patient, a not so comfy chair for a visitor, a small TV and a VCR.  Some of these rooms have a window with a view of the roof top.  I get to go to one of these rooms for my tx.  If it's too noisy in the hallway, I can close the door so I can hear the movie.  It's pretty nice. They also have a \"kitchen\" area with a coffee machine, hot water for tea and a refridgerator stocked with soda (ginger ale), juices, jello and apple sauce.  We can just help ourselves to what we want. Then there are volunteers that come around and offer to bring us something from the \"kitcen\" or graham crackers. ",

I like to think of my chemo treatments as something that is going to make me well and rid my body of any cancer cells.  I don't think of it as \"oh, this is going to make me sick\".  It's better to think this going to make me well (even if you feel a little crappy for a bit).",

I looked up Taxotere on MedLine Plus: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a696031.html and it indicates to call your doctor if you experience certain symptoms like muscles aches, bone pain, flu-like symptoms, swelling.  So you should call your doctor ASAP as there may be something they can give you or tell you to do to relieve the symptoms.",

Brush:  Use a special wig brush.  Anything else may pull hairs out.  It's a wire brush with widely spaced \"bristles\". Before you wash it, brush it out. Put cool water in a sink, add a bit of shampoo (I've been using baby shampoo) and swish the wig around in the soapy water.  Rinse it with cool water.  I then roll mine in a towel to get most of the water out.  Put it on wire wigs stand or paper towel roll to dry.  You want air to be able to get to it from all sides so it will dry quickly. Do NOT put the wig on the styrofoam head while it's wet.  I was told this would cause it to stretch out of shape. Do NOT brush it when it's wet.  If you want to, use your fingers to put the hairs back into place a little. When it's dry, you can brush it.  I found I didn't have to do anything to get it back to it's original style. You can also find wig care tips on the Look Good, Feel Better site: http://www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org/women/hair_help/wig_care.htm Also, be sure to keep it away from HEAT.  Do NOT open an oven door when you're wearing it ... it will frizz up. I'm glad you switch radiologists and now like the people in the office.  It will make your treatments more pleasant.",

I've received numerous cards, flowers, gifts and e-mails from friends and relatives.  Each one brought smiles to my face and warmed my heart.  A friend's daughter made me a special card with pictures of Bearded Collies (my breed of dog) on it that she found on the internet and she made me a puzzle.  That was just so sweet and thoughtful. My co-workers gave me a beautiful good wishes Teddy Bear.  I took it to the hospital with me when I had the mastectomy and the tyroidectomy.  I slept with the bear - imagine a 50 yr old sleeping with a Teddy Bear!  But it helped me to feel better and less stressed.  Now I keep it by my bed and think of my friends at work when I see it. Another friend sent me a Guardian Angel Teddy Bear.  That one sits on my dresser. It is truely wonderful to have the support of family, friends (both those we know in person and in cyberspace), and co-workers (those are also in the friends category).",

If you're going to get a wig, you should go to a wig shop before you lose your hair.  They can then match your color and style more easily. Hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas.",

My husband shaved my hair to 1/2\" all over.  He was afraid to cut it shorter.  At this length, the hair is able to lay flat on my head in the direction it grows.  I only feel a prickley/sharp sensation on my scalp if the hair gets rubbed to the opposite direction from which it grows.  Sometimes I feel it when resting my head on something and moving it around. If hair is shaved shorter and the hair sticks up at that length, I'm thinking if anything touches it, it would be uncomfortable. What do you ladies think?  Does this theory make sense?",

Natalie:  Yea!  Half-way there!  I'm glad that your tx went smoothly and hope your nuelasta shot doesn't leave you too achy.  Tylenol helped me with the aches I felt.  I was told that \"most people\" have the same reaction to the tx, though some of the side effects (like fatigue) are cummulative.  Mine all went smoothly, and I hope all of yours go smoothly too. Debbie:  Hope you're able to get rest while you're working (and with a child at home and all). I bet the office pizza party will be fun.  I love pizza and because of a low-carb diet I'm on haven't had any since cheating in August. Linda: My eyes feel a little weird.  Not really too watery, just different. I never lost all my eyelashes or eyebrows.  I don't put any mascara on or eye-makeup.  The snow must look beautiful (at least while it's white and clean).  We had some snow followed by frozen rain so now whatever wasn't shoveled up is a sheet of ice.  We shoveled our walks and driveway and the sun melted it nicely. But my neighbor across the street (she's in her 90's), her driveway is ice even though a plow came and cleared it.  I put some rock salt on it yesterday and that helped, I'll have to go put more down today.  How many more treatments do you have to go (3 down, xx to go)?  Your ethnic dinner sounds like fun each year.  We do the same old same old. TexasKaren:  I'm going to check out the all pictures from your benefit later.  I took a quick peek and saw the signing of your head.  That's was great!  Did you charge extra for it?  I think my legs did get a restless feel to them but I don't know if it was from the steroids or from the neulasta shot.  I did get \"hot flashes\" at night and would have to throw off all the blankets and then put them on when I got cold.  I think that will get worse when I start on the tamoxifen. Karyll:  Glad your sense of humor is going strong.  I laugh when I read your posts.  And yes, I read each post about body hair with interest.  Just when does it start growing back? Karen R:  Hope your chemo today goes smoothly.  We'll all be thining about you.  Good-luck with your shopping trip too and that the stores aren't too crowded. Just want you all to know that you've inspired me to put up a small Christmas tree this year.  I haven't put one up for several year.  We had central air put in a few years back and when they put things up in the attic they just piled everything on one side of the attic or the other.  I've been afraid to go up there to find stuff.  Well, all you ladies putting up decorations for the holidays made me get off the couch and go up there to find a few things to decorate the house.  Thank-you for the inspiration!! Hope everyone is feeling great today and has a great day.",

I've been back at work for 2 months now and on Tamoxifen for 2 months.  It's fun being back at work and getting back to normal ... mostly anyway.  Sometimes I think I have some short circuits in my brain and don't think quite clearly.  The other day at work I went into a friends office to get some M&Ms (he keeps a jar in there for everyone to snack on) and noticed that water was dripping from the light fixture on the ceiling.  I saw a wastebasket in the office and even thought it would be useful for catching the drips instead of the carpet, but didn't think to move it myself.  I told a friend about the drip and called the building folks to come take a look at it.  My friend was more clear headed than I was and moved the waste basket to catch the dripping water. My sister got me started playing with WebKinz.  It's really geared for kids, but hey, it's fun.  Hope you all enjoy your weekend and vacations.  I hope we hear from Karyll again soon too.",

The Friday before I was to start Chemo, I discovered an absyssed tooth (one I'd had a root canal on earlier in the year).  I ended up having the tooth pulled and Chemo delayed another two weeks.  I bet the oncologist thought I was trying to avoid him.  My first Chemo treatment was on October 1st. And the oncologist kept asking me if I was okay; if anything else  happened in the last 5 minutes.  Nope.  I was fine. I received Taxotere followed by Cytoxan.  It probably took about 2-3 hours.  I did not have any reactions during the treatments ... well except the cold arm/hand from the cold IV.  A jacket helped keep my arm warmer.  I watched some movies during the treatment and ate lunch. I guess I was pumped full of steriods because I did have a little trouble sleeping for a few days.  I'll ask the oncologist if I can take Melatonin or something to help next time. I got the neulasta shot on Oct 2nd and only felt slight twinges now and then in my joints/bones. I feel good and have even been able to continue exercising on our Nordic Track machine and taking walks around the block with our dog. I have the anti-nauseau medications on hand (just in case).  I did take a stool softener (to keep things moving along) and then was fine. I haven't cut my hair short yet.  I do have a wig on hand for when I need it. 1 down and 3 to go! Hugs to all. Karen",

CAT scan, brain mri (due to melanoma on face) and bone scane.  Due to prior history, my breast surgeon recommended double mastecomy with reconstruction (due to prior history of LCIS on right breast).  Surgery was done on June 27th.  Met with the oncologist and was supposed to start Chemo in August (6-8 weeks after surgery).  Found out I had thyroid cancer so had to have that out on Sept 4th.  And Chemo rescheduled for mid-September.  Right before that was supposed to start, I had an infected tooth and had to have the tooth pulled ... and chemo delayed another 2 weeks. Finally started chemo on Oct 1st and had 2nd one on Oct 22.  Hopefully everything will stay on track from here on out so I can be done before the New Years.",

I just finished 4 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan 3 weeks apart on December 3rd.  I felt pretty good throughout.  Some constipation (get peri-colace) and fatigue.  Some foods didn't quite taste the same.  I seemed to have tolerated the TC well.  I was also on disability from work during that time so I was able to get plenty of rest.  It was scary not knowing what to expect.  I didn't know how I'd feel during the treatment or afterwards.  I really didn't feel much during the tx, but my arm and hand did get cold (take a soft small blanket with you in case you need to wrap your arm up for warmth).  I felt about the same during and after each tx. I just want to stress to you ... LISTEN to your body and get REST when you need it.  Don't try to do too much too early. Keep a count-down of your treatments going.  It's nice when you can start checking off each treatment and can see the last one coming into sight. Here is a link to some helpful tips for dealing with the side effects: http://community.breastcancer.org/topic/69/conversation/478386?page=1 As for wigs, my insurance company said they didn't cover a wig.  I had my Dr write out a prescription for a Hair Prothesis and the Wigs store wrote Hair Prothesis on the receipt.  I submitted a claim to my insurance and they paid for the whole thing!!  Even though they said they don't cover wigs.  Submit a claim for it in case they will pay for it.",

I think I only used it once or twice the first day - the drugs make you sleepy.  I didn't take any pain medications once I was home.  Maybe I have a high tolerance for pain. They get you up and walking again the day after surgery.  I didn't really want to walk and it was hard getting out of bed.  I had to walk hunched over a bit so as to not pull the stitches.  It was very hard but walking does start to help you feel better and relieves the neasusea.  As others mentioned, you have to be very careful when you get up.  Your body will let you know the right way to move.  Listen to it!  When you're home you will need to sleep propped up using pillows.  My husband bought me two pillow wedges to put under my head/back.  That helped.  I also slept on the couch sitting up for the first few nights home. I think I was able to drive again about a week after surgery providing I wasn't taking any pain medication. About a week after surgery, my plastic surgeon had me put into a surgical girdle ... did anyone else have one of those??  It had hooks & eyes and zippers up the sides and ends just below the bust.  It keeps the abdomen compressed.  I had to wear it 24/7.  I'm sure it helped keep things in place and fluids from building up. A week later, they put me into a surgical girdle without the zippers and in one two sizes smaller!!  It took two nurses to pull it up on me and when they did, they lifted me off the floor!  It was so funny.  I was worried about getting it on again at home after a shower, but it does stretch.  I ended up buying a 2nd one so I'd have one to wash and one to wear. Don't try to overdo it.  Take the time to recuperate.  I started going for walks around the block (slowly) until my plastic surgeon told me that was too much like exercise and not to.  It caused some fluids to build up and he had to drain it using a syringe.  Not fun, so take it easy and let your body get the rest it needs. My breast surgeon gave me a CD and book \"Prepare For Surgery, Heal Faster\" (I think that's the title).  It uses guided imagery and relaxation techniques.  It must work because I'd fall asleep while listening to it.  (www.healfaster.com) Best wishes.
