We suspected it was due to an anti-nausea drug I'd taken and avoided thereafter. For whatever reason, I didn't get another headache after any of my subsequent infusions. For me, the nail pain was associated with my nails separating from the nail beds. It's been three months since that started (at the end of my treatment) and, while annoying, hasn't been too bothersome. A couple of the nails have broken off, but they don't hurt. I recommend keeping your nails very short. Also, I used this as an excuse to try dark, opaque nail polish. I feel so hip in my OPI Lincoln Park After Dark. : ) Hang in there. It will be over before you know it!",

I had my last infusion three months ago, and it is already starting to feel like ancient history. So hang in there. You will get through this and be better than ever. I found it therapeutic to summarize my experience in an essay, and friends who've passed it around have apparently found it helpful as well, so here it is: https://medium.com/@AShepherd/how-i-lost-my-hair-found-my-groove-86628c04b894 Stay strong!",
