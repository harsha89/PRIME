Being quite scared of the possibilities, I have been doing some reading, including the many inspirational stories, presented by all of you brave women. I have noticed, that some of you have noted, your biopsy results, were negative, only to later on, find out, it was indeed, IBC. Seeing as my only current symptoms are the rash, which has almost cleared up, and is only a rough patch now, and breast pain, which included shooting pain, as well as an aching, some times I think my arm is sore, as well, but the mind is a powerful thing, I am concerned with either, the biopsy missing (it), or the biopsy not being performed, in the (right) place. How realistic are these concerns? Should I be adamant, my breast surgeon address them? Should I request additional biopsies? My anxiety is working on overdrive!

I always enjoy reading your responses, on the boards :) Let me clarify this, a little better. In December, I had severe pain in my RIGHT breast, that was pure torture, for months, along with my breast being heavier, and more full, than my left. My doctor insisted it was just mastalgia. Not being content with their diagnosis, I had googled my symptom, and of course, it brought me to IBC information, which is where I first learned of IBC. Thankfully, my breast pain subsided in January. about a month after seeing my doctors. Fast forward to two weeks ago. . I was getting dressed one morning, and noticed a bright red, raised patch/rash on my LEFT breast. Having previously learning about IBC, it was the first thing that came to mind. I decided before calling my breast surgeon, and becoming irrational, I would treat it at home, in hopes of it going away. I took antibiotics, and applied creams. No change, just spread. I saw the breast surgeon on Tuesday, and he scheduled a biopsy, for this morning. I have also developed shooting pains, aching, and when I lift my arm, it is sore. My previous statement about 'Not knowing' if my arm was sore, was in regard to my anxiety. While I KNOW my arm is sore, especially when lifting it, I am uncertain if my anxiety is on overdrive, and there is a true correlation, between that and what is going on with my breast. My apologies, if NO ONE HERE, has experienced, what I spoke of, in regard to a negative biopsy, I might have read it elsewhere. I will find the article. The following is a portion of one of the articles, in which I read, on one of the IBC support pages. 'My story begins on February 6, 2001 in a lingerie fitting room. At age 60, I was looking for my first-ever red lace bra to wear on Valentine's Day, which is also my husband's birthday. As I took off the bra I had tried on and glanced in the mirror, I noted bright redness all around the nipple of my left breast. I was sure it wasn't there when I had showered in the morning. \"The redness must have rubbed off the bra,\" was my first thought. Closer examination led to the alarming conclusion that the redness was coming from within my breast. I had no other symptoms of what I now know to be ibc -- no swelling, no warmth, no peau d'orange, no pain. Just the very puzzling redness. Ten days later I got in to see my primary care physician. By now the redness had faded to pink, but it was still clearly evident. The doctor mentioned that this type of redness was typical of an infection in nursing mothers called mastitis, but that mastitis was unlikely in a woman my age. He also mentioned that mastitis is typically treated with antibiotics, in which case the infection -- and redness -- generally disappears. I told him that I was already on antibiotics for a severe sinus infection, confirming that we likely were not dealing with mastitis. His exam showed no lumps and no masses -- the \"typical\" red lights for breast cancer. I was so relieved -- I didn't yet know that you don't have to have a lump to have breast cancer. However, he did note swollen lymph nodes in my arm pit and immediately called a breast surgeon and made an appointment for me. The surgeon first ordered a mammogram, which appeared \"normal\", except for showing the swollen lymph nodes. Only after the mammogram was compared with my previous one, did we see a new thickening of the breast tissue. So the mammogram was followed by an ultrasound-guided \"punch\" biopsy of breast tissue and skin in the area that appeared to be most affected. The pathology report came back with no evidence of malignancy. . I rejoiced at my good fortune! By now I had researched enough to know that my doctors had been looking for evidence of inflammatory breast cancer, and it was something I surely did not want to have! However, my surgeon was not satisfied with the pathology report and vowed to determine the cause of the redness (now almost completely gone) and the swollen lymph nodes (one by now the size of a walnut). She performed a stereotactic biopsy in a different location in the breast, and this one yielded the frightening news that it was, after all, ibc. She told me the plan of treatment would involve chemo, an MRM, more chemo, and radiation.' This is where my question, in regard to biopsies, comes from. I have not been obsessing for six months, as a matter of fact, I have not thought of (it), once since January, but I am however, glad I learned of IBC, as the rash I have, would have never been a concern for me, and I would not have sought doctors advice. Thanks, for your insight, kicks. I am amazed at the strength, you all possess, it is quite admirable. ",

I have such respect, and admiration, for all of you brave women, who face BC, and continue to share your stories. Continued well-wishes, and good health! ",
