Robin, what is the breath hold technique? Carolyn, how are your treatments going?  (I was kind of surprised at how easy and smooth the whole treatment was my first time. I guess i imagined visible beams or something. My DH laughed at that!) Good luck ladies! ((Hugs))",

Is it a different kind of machine?",

The American Cancer Society website suggests cancer patients-no matter when you had cancer- get the inactivated vaccine in October/November and their family members be vaccinated as well.  There are anti-viral medicines that you can take within one or two days of coming down with the flu if you do get it, but you need to call your doctor right away so you can start it.  It says cancer patients and survivors are at greater risk for having serious problems if they get the flu, even if they are cancer free now.  If you didn't get vaccinated this year, remember those anti-virals that can help if you do happen to get the flu. Everyone's situation is a little different, so you should check with your doctor before getting the flu vaccine.  Good luck, and don't forget your hand sanitizer!!:)",

Had my lumpectomy 11/29 and just finished 31 rads yesterday. I will start my Tamoxifen in two weeks and will switch to AI when they're certain I haven't had a period for one year. A friend of mine has been on Tamoxifen for two and a half years and has only had issues with hot flashes. I've heard great things about organic apple cider preventing hot flashes. (Bragg's vinegar) Ask your homeopathic about it. You can also look it up on the web. The claims for what apple cider vinegar can do are amazing. My mom always used aloe straight from the plant on minor burns we'd have as kids, and apple cider vinegar on sunburns to take away the pain. i hope you have a grand celebration for your birthday!! My sister came to Wi from Ohio for mine and we saw Pat Benetar and Journey in Milwaukee on my birthday!! It was soooooo fun and greatly needed stress release for me. This whole experience has made me realize how much I take for granted in my life and to appreciate life and to live it more fully. My daughter just texted me from college and told me the Zac Brown Band will be in Wi in June. I told her it's a date! Good luck with rads and stay positive! Prayers to all of my BC sisters!",

I had a lumpectomy on the 29th of Nov. so I'm ready to get on with the next phase of treatment. I need to decide whether to join a phase lll study comparing the standard 6 week treatment for early stage BC to a 3 week course of treatment which uses the same total amt. of radiation as in the standard but in larger doses to finish in 3 weeks instead of 6. My RO will discuss it in more detail tomorrow. It would be nice not to have to drive 45 min. into Madison and back, but I'm concerned about the side effects at the higher dose, especially being on my left side.",

So now I'm getting paranoid.  I guess my MO (who has since moved to Colorado at the beginning of June) mentioned the possibility of IBC to my BS (but not to me) after my first bout with cellulitis.
