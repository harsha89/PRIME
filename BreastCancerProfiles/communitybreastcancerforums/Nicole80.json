      "Content": "Apr 22, 2017 05:34AM - edited Apr 22, 2017 05:35AM by Nicole80 I'm a 36 year old female with infertility and no family historyof breast cancer. I have an itchy, scaly, flakey lesion on areola (no nipple involvement) that has doubled in size in the 3 months since it first presented. It seems to be growing toward the nipple. About a month ago I realized that a lump had formed above it and was promptly sent to imaging. I had a diagnostic mammogram and breast ultrasound which revealed nothing and was given a clean report. I was still not completely relieved so I met with a dermatologist on Monday and he performed a punch biopsy of the lesion. I'm absolutely terrified that it's going to turn out to be Paget's. I'm impatiently waiting on the path report to come back. I hate waiting!!!!!!! It's soooooo hard!!!!",
