About 16 weeks ago, my left breast started to itch.  The first doctor gave me cortisone cream, which did nothing.  Four weeks on, I found a very small lump and was sent for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, both showed nothing (I am 38 years old).  Many weeks later, the small lump is now the size of a pea.  I am still waiting to get into the public hospital for a consultation with a specialist.  In the meantime, I parted with a large sum of money to see a private breast surgeon who told me the lump is a breast lobe or lobule which I can feel now because I've lost so much weight (17kg in 6 months).  She found it on an ultrasound and insists it is a lobe/lobule.  I have the public hospital appointment in another 3 weeks, should I insist on a biopsy?  I find it strange that a lobe/lobule would be directly under the nipple.  I was under the impression that they are arranged in a clockface sort of pattern further back from the nipple.  Your thoughts?
