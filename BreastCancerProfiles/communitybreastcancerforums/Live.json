I hope your \"crazy\" dreams go away soon. lolÂ  I also feel my vision has changed. I keep cleaning my glasses. Hope you can really enjoy this week. Before you know it you will be on the other side! Madison Good luck today! Sending you healing hugs! Josie, I had cording \"webbing\" soon after surgery. I went for pt and they cleared it up with massage and exercise. ckk sorry the train has arrived and you are feeling ick. Amazing story with you DD. So glad you got your purse back! Big hugs till you feel better. Rachel, great that you got to take your friends out and show them around. Your energy level is amazing! Glad you held on to your hair! I never lost mine. It does move around at times and ends up too high lol. Oh well, it is what it is....... Heather so glad you got out and felt good! I think not napping is a big thing. You know you are on your way to recovery! Bailey sounds like you had a great time at the party. Good times with good friends is the best medicine! I'm still having hot flashes day and night. Night is so much worse. Not getting a full nights sleep takes a toll and I have to push myself so much more. Days are starting to feel more normal. If I could only get rid of this water retention I think I would feel great. YesterdayÂ I did 40 minutes on the treadmill.Â I can't believe just three weeks ago I could hardly walk in my yard. Still I'm going at a slow pace. My legs have achy and I can't tell if it is from the water or the exercise. How is everyone doing with the water pills? I am so impatient. Today my DH and I are going to a meditation at the local library. He is so not a meditation person lol. I can't wait to see this. He is more a hockey/fishing/football guy :)",

Matthew was the one who mentioned the generic taxatere and the reaction I got. I cant imagine giving that toxic crap in generic form, what assholes! Ann, I had to laugh at the saying \"ten miles of bad road\"! I've never heard that one! Without makeup I look like that too. My eyes look hollow and the rims are red and I have hugh dark circles fromÂ interrupted sleep. It wasn't easy staying up late for my D. I called her to tell her I was coming early but couldn't get off the couch and ended up ten minutes late. Still I was very happy I was able to do everything I needed to. It gave me the boost to increase my activity and I am feeling much better for it. Glad to hear you are having no problems with the Arimidex, hope it continues. Rachel, I can't stand mosquito's to begin with, now I have to be afraid of the little bastards! Agh! Hope your arm is alright. I noticed a small cut on my cuticle a few days ago and freaked out. I was putting hand sanitizer on it in the car, then neosporin when I got home. I have a great fear of knives now, lol I have always been one to slice into my hand cutting things... I'll have to ask DH to cut my meat now lol Ckk, I like the way your RO is taking preventative measures with the creams before treatment. It makes a lot of sense. I'm going to look for that cream you are using. Thank God we have each other to learn these things! It sounds like our daughters are tough as nails. We should both pat ourselves on the back. They had to have gotten it from us! My D told me I am the strongest person she knows. That I went through this and still kept my sense of humor and smile at people etc. I love that she notices these things. Little does she know I get my strength from her. Good luck with your MO appointment tomorrow. I am curious to hear what he says about the taxotere. Bailey have fun picking up your new addition to your family! Have you picked out a name? Heather I hope your energy picks up soon. I think you are about a week behind me. This week I am feeling closer to normal than ever. Let us know how you do with the Tamoxifin. Karmil,Â  YouÂ know what they say, you can take the girl out of Jersey........Â Today my DH and I made an offer on a house in our homeÂ town! Â We both grew up in southern Bergen County. When my D goes to college we will be snow birds. Glad your flashes have calmed down. Wave, welcome back to the land of the living! It feels great to have energy! So glad you have feeling so much better. I still have the fear like you, that something is wrong with my heart or lungs but every test I have comes back normal. I think the chemo stays in the body a lot longer than the doctors say. My MO told me it was out within 24 hours and we are only having the side effects long after. It sure doesn't feel like that....Good for you getting the handicap sticker! Lisa, the muscle thing has been the one SEÂ that has lingered. I am going to try magnesium for it. Its supposed to help maintain normal muscle and nerve function.Â SomeÂ chemo and Lasix can cause a deficiency.Â I am surprised the epsom salts didn't help. It usually takes away the worst pain.Â I have been drinking hot water with 1/2 lemon morning and night to detox my liver. I think maybe the water retention is causing the muscle/leg pain. My legs are so much better but I still get pitting on my shins, so I know it is still there. Â Wow! you have eyebrows coming in! thats great! Well, DH is back home now after a plane ride from hell. He thought they were going to crash. Storms from Charlotte to Florida were tossing the plane around. I'm glad he is safe at home. We had such winds here last night that the umbrella on my cast aluminum table ripped right off and blew over the house and onto the side of the house. The table is ruined. I found out today there were tornado warnings last night... Wishing all a good nights sleep zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz",

Thankful for yourÂ brotherÂ keeping us all safe. My prayers are with him and your family. My H was a first responder to WTC, he was a Port Authority Police officer. He did his last five years after the eventÂ then we retired here in Fla. I still don't watch orÂ listen toÂ stories or anything about 9/11. I totally understand PTSD.Â I feel like this is what we are all going through on some level. Maybe not to the extent of a war veteran but still difficult. After watching my H, and going through it with him, then dealing with this IÂ feel numb at times. Sometimes it is hard to even think of something to right after reading posts. Like I have checked out to be able to deal with BC. I keep thinking, more time..... Rachel I am hoping you continue to feel good and avoid any trying se's. Karmil the burger and fries were great! The next day my stomach didn't feel so good though!Â I am feeling much better with the bp thing, thanks for asking. Hope you are doing well. I was thrilled to see I have nose hair again! lol. My eyebrows are coming in quick and all I do is add a little pencil and they look pretty normal. Eyelashes are mostly gone with new short ones coming in. I agree the eyelashes look pretty freaky. I have none on the bottom and when I try to use pencil my eyes water so it doesn't last long. The hair on my arms is coming in. I didn't realize it was gone. lol My LE app went well. I was measured for a sleeve and given exercises and massage movements to maintain the arm. The therapist made it sound easy and manageable. He said if I do what I should there should be no problems. It's when it is left undone that it gets difficult. What a relief! Ckk your post is so true. Today in Church I was having the same feelings. It's spring time, a time of new beginnings. We have a lot to be thankful for, especially each other. I am happy to have found all of you here and can't wait until we meet in July/August. It is going to beÂ a wonderful celebration. Enjoy your D jazz concert! What does she play? I asked my RO about supplements and she said don't take anything to stop the radiation from working. I still take my D, C, B-c, multi, AC etc. I don't see how replacing will do anything to the Rads, the rest of my body needs to rebuild. Lisa, I am glad you are feeling better and getting back into life. Good luck tomorrow with your friends. I hope you have a great ride. I'm glad you talked to your MO and they have a plan for you. One less thing to worry about. Wave, good for you! I'm so happy you are feeling better and enjoying company. The wine sounds good. Maybe I will have a glass this evening. I haven't had anything since August. Hope everyone has a good evening!",

It sure is a strange experience. When do you start treatment? Â Lisa, I am hoping I won't have to have blood drawn every week. I thought the shot was given to everyone to make sure our white count was taken care of. I will ask this afternoon when I go for it.Â  Â Your cording sounds mild. You could probably work on it yourself. It is just very gentle tapping and light motion from your elbow into your armpit working across your upper chest and down to your stomach to get things flowing. You may have a small blockage. Also while in the shower just massaging with soap in warm to medium water down from the arm into your armpit and across the upper chest. The focus is redirecting the flow of lymph fluid.Â  I hope you both enjoy your weekend. It is beautiful day in Fla, sunny and 70's. I'm going to relax over the next few days and see how things go. I'm also going to focus on staying positive. It makes things so much easier.Â  Sorry about the revved up post yesterday.

It is so true! My hair hasn't started falling out yet. My head has been feeling sore though. I think that happens before it starts.... Annie, its so hard to see those commercials. My heart just about breaks watching children having cancer. I don't think I will ever watch another movie about cancer. On a funny note I remember going to see \" Terms of endearment\" in 1983, I was 22 and with my husband and his mother. While in the theatre I was crying and wiping my face. When the movies was over I went to the ladies room and when I looked in the mirror, my face looked ten years older! I said omg! that movie aged me! I realized when we got home that I had been reading the news paper before we left and the print from the paper was on my hands, when I wiped my face from crying it dried on my face. lol Heather, I hope you enjoyed Christmas shopping!

I had some water retention because they added a whole bag of saline to prevent the burn I got the 1st time on my arm. My blood pressure shot up to 180/97 and I had a 40 pulse. The doctor said it was because of all the salt. I was up all night in a panic and felt drained yesterday. Today I started with the bladder pain again. Even after all the fluids and drinking a ton of water. I was peeing orange this morning. Beside that I am feeling pretty normal. We will see after the shot this afternoon. I will be taking the claritin and tylenol. On a good note my doctor said my counts came back so well last time, if they stay the same he will lower the neulasta.Â  Lisa! wow, so sorry you went through such an ordeal. Amazing they brought you out of it so quick... You look absolutely adorable in your penquin hat and your long hair makes me so jealous!

We are all here for you, so chime in anytime.Â  I also struggle with the idea of making someone so sick to get them better but I continue to hear success stories from people who have gone down this very path and are 15+ years with no recurrence. I have also heard of people who tried only alternative and are not doing so well. I guess it is a personal choice we have to unfortunately make. I can say this, I will be making much healthier choices in the future, with diet, exercise, herbs etc.Â  Heather glad you are feeling better. Good luck with your hair! It actually felt good taking charge. Nice to know you have such a short drive now. I have an hour drive and at time wish it were closer but I love my doctor and wouldn't change for anything...

Maybe because some of the people who I was sure would be there for me have not called even once. Though facebook is probably the easiest way to communicate these days... Glad you got support! Day 3,I think I still feel the effects of # 3 so this one I will spend taking good care of myself. I finally got some sleep last night but was still out of breath this morning. Just a note, on Yahoo anyone can start a private group. You can name it what you want and you have to be invited to join..... Wishing everyone a good day!",

Glad you are feeling more energy. Feeling 80 is scary! Ann, Wow! your hair is really taking off! Mine is just peach fuzz that is really short. I also have the strays that were left from buzzing. I became very attached to them and refuse to cut them. They are about 1/2 inch. My sister asked me the craziest question yesterday. She asked is your hair growing and I said yes, and she asked me how does it feel to have hair! really? I told her I'll let you know in six months.. Â Rachel, I have a cleaning service and LOVE it! It will be a sad day when I stop. I put out clean sheets and they change the bed. They also do the inside windows. Ahhh heaven! Josie, I also freaked when I first saw the bill coming in but they told me that after the discount for the insurance company it would be much lower and it is. Now I have a pile of checks here and have to sit down and figure which goes to what bill. I am dreading it. I think I will just bring all the checks in and have them do it. Try not to stress too much. Nice to hear you are feeling well so quick! Karmil, accupuncture was wonderful! very relaxing . I am using it for the water retention and it is working great. My stomach was huge too. Now it is just normal huge from having children.. I hope you get it under control quick. It is so uncomfortable. Ckk, good to hear your feeling better and back to baking with your daughter. I'm so jealous your getting snow. I miss it soÂ much. It is sunny and going into the 80s here. It's nice but not all year. I love the seasons. Well, I am four weeks out now and feeling much better. I still have muscle aches, I guess it will fade with time. I was supposed to start rads on the 12th of march but I'm not sure now. I was going to go to Mayo Clinic but it is 3 hours round trip. I saw someone closer to home yesterday and he wants to start four weeks later. I've never heard of this. That would make it 8 weeks from chemo! He said there are less complications because of the chemo still in the body. It makes my decision hard. I want this over now! Wish all a good day! :)",

This morning I started reading a very good book \" Saving Generation next\" by Debi Waldeck. It is about achieving universal healthcare by restoring the health of generations to come. How the gut trains the immune system and how to restore health. Its very interesting, it covers everything from allergies, fatique, auto immune diseases and cancer. The sea veggies sounds like a good idea. Also green drinks, I just bought kale for salads and soups. It is one of the super foods, it helps to prevent cell damage and prevent cancer cell replication... Band performance with your D sounds like fun! Enjoy! Â I had mentioned the Aloe I am taking now. It is Herbal Aloe Force, its organic and raw.Â Â Its for immune support, it can be taken with chemo and radiation. You can read about it by typing in Herbal Aloe Force Â Juice. They also make a topical gel. Â I'll let everyone know how I feel after taking it for a while.... Hope everyone has a good day.Â ",

Gracie, good for you, listening to your body. Hope you get some good weather so you can begin again. Karmil, I have lost most of my eye lashes on the bottom. The top have hung in but by a thread. I bought fake ones yesterday. My eyebrows are in sad shape too. They are growing in now but falling out quicker. I got some of those too, I hope I don't look too Elmo in them. They are real hair and look freakish in the box. Ckk, good luck with your 1st rad treatment today. It is so quick you won't believe it! Momof3, good for you with the lashes! Hopefully your bw will rebound and you will be on your way again with rads. Well, i really want to just lie down and take aÂ nap but have to shower and get ready for my trip to Jacksonville. I have a 1:30 app today, then its all mornings. I'm wondering if I'm already feeling the effects of radiation. I will ask someone today. Hope all have a good day",

My heart was racing so fast I could hardly breathe. today it is much better. I slept 10 hours, I'm still fatiqued but pulse is hanging around 80 resting which is a real rest after dealing with high 90's for weeks. Don't feel bad about feeling bad. It goes with the territory! Chemo sucks! Lisa sorry your having an issue with your vein again. My first was pretty bad quite a large area. It hurt like hell! I still have a mark. It took its time leaving. You will be okay. I think I was put on antibiotics for it. With every treatment after it would get a little warm. My last visit with my onc he mentioned it and said he thought it was because they were using generic chemo! It sure makes one wonder huh?..This treatment not one mark on my arm! Ckk for round 3 I used to take a ice bag to bed with me for those flashes because it was so hard to get up and get one while having them. lolÂ  enough already!!!!Â  I will pm you with my facebook name. Feel better! Anniebell I am keeping a close watch on my foot. It looks a bit better. I'm waiting for the nurse to call back to see what they are going to do since my wbc is so low. How are you doing? I hope all is well since your friend went home. I was surprised to hear WI is in the 50's thats great! Wave, I have been treatingÂ my footÂ as if, with antibiotic cream and now I'm on antibiotics again.Â  I think I caught it in time. It never uclerated. Just nasty bright red and very sore.

Glad you have your Mom to help out! What a gift :) Keep us posted Rachel really??!! we can sleep on our stomach? I thought with the node removal anything but the back was not a good idea. You have made my day! I so miss sleeping on my left sideÂ but stomach sounds good too!Â  About the hair thing. I have managed to keep my eyebrows and eyelashes but they are thin and I have gaps in the lastes. It is a pleasure to not have to shave my legs and armpits. I just want to know one thing.

About the hand foot problem, are they going to lower your meds? They lowered my tax for my last. I had to beg. Good that they are keeping a close watch... Taking B-complex may help. Heatherb8 Â Can't you just drag it into the hallway or something. I think they come apart real easy. I wish I could help you... Be careful with your walk, its only been a few days since your infusion. :) Karen glad you are feeling better. I have heard lemons also make us lose water weight. I have been drinking it also. Yum! Ckk my family is loud too lol. I swear we get looks when the whole family is out for dinner. Its pretty insane but lots of fun. Momof3 and Bailey Good Luck! waiting to hear good news! hugs! Okay, day 10, I have exercised inside and now I am venturing out for a walk with my guy. Â I am hoping for a 30 minute walk today. Please pray! Robin xoÂ ",

My mom had one put in over a year ago, she is doing well with it. She was filling up with water. Her legs were hugh! Now they are normal and she is feeling good, all her problems with racing heart etc are gone. She will be 92 in May. Sending prayers for a speedy recovery. Hope you get some relief with your eyes. Momof3, so happy you didn't have to get the neulasta shot. They were def worse than the chemo! I loved your story about your son. He is a smart one! lol It's hard to believe the hairdresser didn't know. Is yours real hair? I think for the most part people just don't pay attention that closely. Good for us! Bailey glad your settling in with JD, who is the alpha male in the group? When we introduced our firstÂ Cocker SadieÂ toÂ our new Cocker, although the new one was only 9 weeks old he took over right from the start.Â Poor Sadie didn't know what to do. Taz woud just whine atÂ her and she would drop her toy and walk away :(Â Â Â  Unfortunately we ended up giving him back to the breeder after a year. He went after my D face when she was just three years old. Now we have a six lb malti-poo Coco who is pure white and is so sweet. He perches on my husbands shoulders like a parrott. I will send a picture. Josie, I am going through the same thing with my hair. I look every morning to see what progress it is making. There is a race going onÂ between the dark and white. Right now white is winning the race. I've been massaging my scalp to try to increase blood flow.Â  I hope the dry mouth thing goes away quickly for you. It sounds like the se's are minimal, thats great! Gracie, good for you, not having to do rads. I was so torn between mastectomy or lumpectomy. It felt like I had no time to decide, everything went so fast. I hope your fatique gets better soon. Are you exercising? Lisa, I was hoping to hear some good news about the tamoxifen. Can they lower the dose? I will be having the same... Hope you are able to ride your bike to work soon, it sounds wonderful and yes, the price of gas is crazy high. Be good to yourself! Hope you get some good sleep tonight. Heather, do we have pain to expect with the rads? I know the skin will be sore like sunburn but pain? Ugh, not wanting to do this shit anymore :(Â Â  I was told no deodorant while having the radiation but will ask about Body Luminosity. I thought I would have to go everywhere with baby wipes cleaning myself from time to time. I don't want to stink!Â  The weather hasÂ been crazy here in Fla. too 89* a few days ago and now 60's. Glad you had a good winter after the last two. Hope your fatique tapers off and you are done with it.Â I am anxious to get back to a real normal. Ckk, Hope your able to enjoy the beautiful weather today! I think we need the naps now that the chemo is done and the anxiety of \"another\" one is over. It feels nice to rest easy.. I was mapped out two days ago, they are using a sharpie pen, no tattoos. I start rads on Monday, 33 treatments to the whole breast. I chose Mayo. The bedside manner is really not there but I feel safer havingÂ itÂ done there versus a small town hospital.Â So it will be long rides for the next several weeks for me. I still feel like my body has far to go with getting back energy and rebuilding muscle tone. I am up to 30 minutes on the treadmill daily and have increased the pace. I do get achy but will deal with it to get stronger sooner. The water retention continues to get better. I am still getting accupuncture twice a week and have dropped 10 lbs. I have taken sugar and most almost all white foods out of my diet. My house isÂ filled with fruit and veggies that I snack on,Â lol almost wrote snake! My brain is officially fried. It is scary, I forget how to spell, use the wrong words, make up my own words. I have become an idiot! Does this ever get better? Hope everyone has a good day!Â  Rachel, my thoughts are with you today!Â ",

Heatherb8, congrats on almost being atÂ the half way point! Woot!Â Its great to hear you are getting out in the beautiful PA weather! After the last two years of snow, I'll bet it feels great to have such an early spriing/summer.Â We will be in Milford the 3rd week of June then staying until the middle of August.Â I can't wait to be under those tall oaks! Florida trees don't do much to shade anything and the sun is so hot I have to wear long sleevesÂ spring and summer.Â Hope you enjoyed your golfing today! I found an amazing website for lymphedema sleeves at my RO's its called lymphedivas.com. They are really pretty andÂ come in different patterns and colors to compliment different outfits. They are also light weight and supposed to be very comfortable. Two breast cancer patients designed them and started the business. Sadly one has passed and now her brother has taken over the company. On the brochure they picture a woman wearing one and bowling! I had no idea we can bowl with the node arm. My RO said we can! I felt so good after leaving my appointment, not so disabled.

I had an appoinment with Onc this morning. They said I would be getting a base line marker test done after rads then will follow up forever. I am happy that someone has my best interest in mind.Â  Lisa I would call your MO and make another app and be sure you don't see theÂ PA. It just doesn't sound right whatÂ she told you.. They just can't leave you hanging. It doesn't make sense. Â I have been feeling dizzy/off balance lately and found out my bp was only 85/47 this morning. They took me off the beta blocker that was keeping my pulse down.Â I was going to get hydrated but they took it again and it wasÂ 106/60 so theyÂ sent me out for a juicy cheeseburger and salty fries. It's not something I normally eat but tasted wonderful! Yea for junk food! My rad breast is red and sore and I'm glad I have the weekend to give it a rest. It usually calms down by the next day. Momof3 I totally agree with you, this is tramatic. My doctor was telling me today not to think like that. She said we had pains before and we will have them now but this whole experience makes life feel so fragile and short. Life as we had known it changed in a split second. Its just too muchÂ to face sometimes. One way to stop worryingÂ \"though I have not mastered it\" is to put up a stop sign when you start to worry and refocus. Or give yourself a certainÂ time a day toÂ worry then put it to bed until tomorrow.Â You try it and let me know if it works! lol Bailey your idea sounds good.Â Hopefully in theÂ future there will beÂ something to prevent BC. Too many opinions make itÂ so much more scary. Like they don't know what they are doing. I saw four different doctors for myÂ FCÂ because my doctor was having a baby and they all read my report each time and said somethingÂ different. WTH!Â  well, my S is here for coffee hope everyone has a good weekend! While at the clinic I went to look at the wigs they had and had the good fortune to get a Pantene beautiful lengths wig made with real hair!!!Â I didn't even realize it until we were on our way home andÂ I read the tag.Â ItÂ feels so nice, I guess I forgot what my hair felt like. :(",

Deep breathing from the diaphragm works wonders for sleeping and bp also. Along with muscle tensing and relaxing may calm you enough to doze off.Â  For me the dryness has caused some nose bleeds.

I have been sitting without any hat/scarf on. I'm hoping it passes soon. Â  I've been reading all the posts about emotions and fears. I also worry about it being somewhere else. I am always feeling lumps lately. Its just plain scary.Â  Â Its good to hear everyone is faring well. Just think just six more weeks for some of us and we will be done and on our way to recovery! I can't wait... I need a long vacation........ Take care everyone",

You really can't tell with this stuff. Thanks for the tip, I will be sending my husband Â to the store to get some. I can't walk outside without something on my head like this! I'm happy you are up and feeling well. It gives us all hope. ckk, sorry you are in the yuck phase. You have company. Don't despair you will feel better and no, there is no way of telling from one day to the next, I am just learning this too. Nice that you washed your hair, and nice that you have some! Feel better soon :) Â This train you speak of is becoming the Â Bi-polar express! Michelle, good luck with the wig! Have some fun. Try to get a comfortable cap for under it. Mine was too tight around my head and it became very sore.Â  Josie, wow! too funny how your children jump at the thought of giving you a mohawk! Thats just great! Â I did mine when it started coming out in the shower, it was about two weeks in.Â  Peace to all......Â ",

I had to force myself to walk around the house yesterday for ten minutes. I think walking really makes a big difference. I also drink a small bottle of gatorade and a bottle of water first thing each morning for dehydration/fatique. I also have this low grade fever now for four days with antibiotics, it must be the taxotere.Â  Baily, good luck tomorrow, keep us posted... Michele, sorry you didn't have fun with the wigs yesterday. Paulayoung.com has some nice wigs starting very low and going up. I got one at the clinic but my best experience was at a beauty supply that carried them. The sales person was wonderful and would not let me leave until I felt pretty. I must repay her someday for her kindness. Josie, no spicy, hot or coffee for a few days. It will get better. I lived on pudding for the first few days.Â  Lisa, neulasta or chemo, it gets you one way or the other. Thank God it does get better! Â Wishing everyone a good day....",

I was very happy how they planned it out. It hardly touches it at all and is nowhereÂ near my heart. I'm still on the treadmill daily, though I have aches and pains on and off all day. I can't seem to figure that SE out at all. I think most of the water retention is gone. My new addition to regaining health is aloe.

So, your packing up to get off this train! Sounds like a great plan. I like that you are sending thank-you notes. It makes it sound final. You are yourself again!

I'm not up to four miles, my goal is two. I have increased my pace a lot and I'm getting stronger all the time. I notice my walking in general is more normal. Normal feels good!! Keep up the good work:)Â  Â  Jen, Welcome! you are in a good place here with a great group of ladies! Â  Rads is def easier than chemo thus far. The ride is a challenge. It takes a little over an hour and they want me to be there 15 minutes early. It takes a good part of the day. The sad part is the waiting room. there are mostly elderly people and they look so weary. It's hard to see them suffer. I'm trying to be up-beat and keep a good attitude, when I really could just break down and cry.Â  My head is a sweaty mess most of the day lately. My neighbor was over today and I just whipped off my scarf without even thinking lol. I just kept on talking to her for a few more minutes before I realized I was topless!

Rachel, I'm glad you were able to vent your feelings after being strong for so long. Its more than okay to let it out. It is healthy!Â I can't believe what your BC friend said to you. How insensitive! There is a \"silver lining\" in it. You really find out who your true friends are when you go through this! Just blow it off and keep onÂ moving forward. You are a strong, amazing woman!Â I have no doubt you will come out on top.. About the lead feet, hang tough! you will make it through and regain all your strength! I clearly remember after myÂ 4th PFCÂ trying to walk \"with a walking stick\" in my back yard and I was hanging on for dear life. Now I am running around doing things I neverÂ dreamed I would be doing so soon. Don't get me wrong I did have a wake up call this weekend. My D hadÂ a dance comp and I had to walk up two flights of stairs about five times. I was so tired by the time I got home I went straight to bed, but I did it!!!! You will too! Karmil,Â I hope everything went well for youÂ today. Â  Jen, I haven't heard about taking a baby asprin after chemo. What does it do to protect? I think acting as if is a great idea. The brain can't tell the difference and soon all will be well. It just takes time. Heatherb8 I think we need time and more time. We will get there together. When my SIL finished rads I felt the way everyone else does. That it was over and she was well and could just get on with her life. I felt she should be happy. What I didn't know is what she went through emotionally. Now, she has totally blocked it out. If I ask her a question I need help with, she says she doesn't remember. I can only hope I \"forget\" too.Â Â  ckk, ugh, sorry you had the stomach flu so soon after chemo. UGH! Hope everyone is feeling better soon. Glad you are taking a zen approach toÂ your hair. When we all meet I will probably still have my salt and pepper hair and wearing it proud! Wave, what your wrote about the life of the patient is so true. That is why we lose ourselves. We are so introspective for so long. Then weÂ panic when we don't feel like our old selves. Well, I know that under all these feelings we are still the same and we will find our way out gradually. Just the way we got here. Momof3, I love that you have so many resources available to you. ItÂ will beÂ great to do something healthyÂ while having rads. I am too far away fromÂ Mayo to use all they have. One of the disadvantagesÂ of taking this route. I would love to find a personal trainer to show me whatÂ to do. Tomorrow I meet with a lymphedema specialist. I have been having some swelling in my arm and want to take care of it before itÂ becomes a problem.Â  No tattoos for me either, IÂ didn't care what they thought. I didn't want one more reminder. Bailey,Â I'm sorry you are having a tough time starting rads. I was so cranky in the beginning too. It was so hard not to cry while lying on the table. I am still freaked everyÂ day. Its soÂ surreal. This is one of the things I said I would never do to my body and here I am, my brain fighting it all the time. TodayÂ I tried toÂ tell myself it was only doing what it had to, killing any stray cancerÂ cells. Idontdosick,Â  I also pray when I getÂ rads that they get the same spot. The way they measureÂ so carefully you would think so. Sometimes they just push my body so gently it doesn't feel likeÂ I have even moved.Â  Â Â  Wave and Heather I got the same reaction from someone I know when I was dropping off my D at dance. I said hello to her and she looked right through me and said nothing. She did say hi to my D. WTH! Rachel sorry about the ticket.Â We used the \"trump\" card when my H got pulled over for speeding on our way to Rads, it worked. The trooper let us off with a warning. We got lucky, we were doing 92 in a 70! Well, good night to all. Have to get some sleep. I have an early start. xo",

They are fine now. No problems since. Iam about 10 weeks PFC. Hang tough you will get through this. Take good care of yourself. Wave Â your poem is beautiful. Glad you decided to read it and share. Â LOL about the music! It reminds me off the music at the clinic. It sounded like the Titanic music. I wanted to bolt the hell out of there!Â I've been thinking of the 6 month mamo too OUCH!!! Hope we are all healed by then. Bailey Congrats on your half way point!!! Rads has been a picnic compared to FC. Rachel, Â the last one just about did me in! lol not really funny.... I expect you will rebound faster than most of us. Its hard when we are in the moment and dealing with it but soon you will get back to where you want to be and I know there will be no stopping you! Sending you healing hugs. Â ",

I have some peeling underneath too, it sucks! I put the aloe on three times a day and fan myself until it dries. Hope you feel better soon. Damn! your doc really asked what you were crying for? I wish i were there with you, I would have kicked him in the groin then asked him why he was crying. Cancer hurts! physically, emotionally and mentally. Â F him! Â  I guess my hormones are kicking into gear too. Sending hugs until you feel better...",
