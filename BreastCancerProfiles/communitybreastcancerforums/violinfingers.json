I've read about the drug and am excited to be getting it (especially since I'm having more and more difficulties with breathing and coughing). Has anyone else been on it or know someone who has gotten it? I know SEs are supposed to be more manageable than chemo. But still, it's discouraging to have advanced on my current regimen. It was working for about 5 months before scans showed growth in the lungs and liver. I could use any helpful information or encouragement you feel like giving. I start this tx the 20th. Thanks!
