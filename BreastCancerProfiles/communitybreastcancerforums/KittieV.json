I didn't get much input from others with BC from my original post so that's why I shortened it to aim at those who have been diagnosed. I am becoming more and more convinced that it is nothing because it doesn't seem that many people have only the retracted nipple as a sign. I'm thinking the itching and pain is because I have been obsessing about it lol!",

I had nonlactational mastitis which cleared up right away with antibiotics but I ended up with an abscess a few months later which I have been dealing with for months now. From what I have read and understand nonlactational mastitis is very hard to get rid of but the fact that the antibiotics are making a difference it great news. I hope your infection clears up soon ðŸ˜Š",

It has now been just over 6 months since I received my B9 biopsy confirming that my lump was caused by an infection. After the biopsy I was given a 6 month wait and see period. So now here I am. I recently had a follow up ultrasound which confirmed that yep the abscess is still there. My question is why the heck would he just leave it there? It seems to me like a ticking time bomb having this ball of infection just hanging out in my breast. Maybe he has a logical reason but I can't think of one. I am going to meet with him to tell him I want it OUT and I hope he gives me no issue. I would just ask for it to be drained but the main reason I had a biopsy in the first place was because the rad said it was too solid to aspirate. Thanks for any insight any one may have.

I understand that but she also complained about how it was so small and she couldn't find it which I think is crap. I have a freaking target over it considering it is directly behind my nipple. She said because she can't feel it it is likely she will cause too much cosmetic damage. She is not comfortable doing something only a cm and it is already on her threshold for what she will operate on. If the surgeon isn't confident she can do a decent job I am certainly not confident she can. I will quit smoking but I will not go back to that doctor for the procedure.",
