      "Content": "Jan 5, 2011 07:11AM - edited Jan 5, 2011 07:40AM by islandmom JulieH  thank you for keeping us in mind.  I am praying your follow up goes well and you are all clear.   I was supposed to start chemo today.  However, after getting a second opinion I changed oncologist and I start tomorrow. My first oncologist recommended TAC x 6 and I was very ready to start but because of the holidays we postponed.  During that time I started to research, the more I learned the more I started to question whether TAC x 6 was the right thing for me.  So I decided to get a second opinion.   I jumped through a LOT of hoops to get an appointment with a recommended oncologist within a short period of time during the holiday season.  Whatever I had to do was so worth it.  She throughly reviewed my case, I had to find mammogram films dating a few years back, biopsy slides, etc. Her recommendation:  Taxotere /Cytoxan TC x 4, exactly what I had seen again and again for women with similar dx. At the end of the visit I told her what my first oncologist recommended.  She explained clearly the risks of  Adrimyacin  outweigh the benefits in my particular case, she cited recent studies.  Furthermore, she would have never bothered with the Oncotype test.  She recommends I do chemo no matter what, because the size and grade of my tumor.    My first oncologist's location was very convenient, so I called the office and explained that I wanted him to review my case and discussed changing my treatment.  The answer was that it was his way or no way.  So I will be driving a few more miles but I take that any day.   ",

I have two nails that have a lovely brown/gray color and they hurt.  I lost my hair, but I noticed couple weeks ago that there is new growth  and upon closer inspection I noted that they are all gray.  Since I have been coloring for a few years I do not know if I had that much gray to begin with.  I will not complain since it is hair.    I do not know if my workout routine is a habit yet but I have been going about 5-4 times per week.  I am begining to feel that I really want to do it.  On the weekends my husband and I go for long walks on the beach.  In the begining I could not go as far, now I can keep going. AimeeMac Congratulations!!  That was so nice to get a purple star and cider.  I did not get any such goodies.    MayMeg  Congratulations with being done with AC.  The second part should be milder in comparison.   I laughed at you taking a nap during working hours.   baf4292  Hopefully you are having an easy time with you last TX.  I think the nurses were happy to see me finish since they had such a hard time finding my veins.  Yesterday, they kept looking at my arm shaking their heads and poking until finally finding one.   Have a great weekend. ",

Bosum, we all go through those phases of feeling discouraged, but instead of looking at all that you do not like try to accentuate your positives, we all have them. About the thickness of the hair, even if you did not do chemo hair just gets thinner as we age. My hair is definitely thinner than few years back, however, if I compare the new growth to the hair after chemo, the new growth is thicker. When I put the hair strand ends together the new growth is at least 40% thicker. In regard to hair length the best thing is not to have expectations, just enjoy every stage. Since my expectations were very low I have been happy at every stage (except the 6 month mark, when it was impossible to manage). The long hair just happened, because I could not bring myself to cut it. Last week I went to the bank, where I have been going forever. Anyway, there was a new teller helping me, the young woman kept looking at me and looking at the picture she had on the screen. She ended up calling the manager to verify it was me. My picture on file has me with very short hair, the teller apologized, she said I just look so different. I thanked her for doing her job.",

The \"hair obsession\" is only understood by us, only we know what is like to check the mirror many times a day. I know it is not an easy road, but here we are making the best of it. I cannot believe you are 16 months post chemo. I am glad to hear you got some hair now. We would love to see a picture... Sometimes we are our worst critics and cannot see the beauty that other see. I think that finding the right hairstyle is really key, it does not matter if it is short or long. How is your texture compared to before? Lorbgoo, You got some serious hair and bangs, to boot! My hair was definitely not that long at that point. I do not see why you could not cut the back just a little, it will make it look fuller. Just make sure the stylist understands though, some like to cut. If you plan to let it grow just start babying it, because you will have some strands for many years. It is probably best to do little trims along the way, that way you get rid of the dry ends. (I am taking a break from doing yard work, but will take a picture after I get cleaned up).",

I started taking Biotin because my hair started falling out at that time. Taking a shower was a stressful experience, because that is when I would see clumps of hair. After I showed my oncologist how much hair I was shedding per day, she tested me for many conditions like thyroid, but everything was normal. After a few months it stopped. BosumBlues, I hear you about the challenges of taming your hair without heat. In the early days I used a blow dryer everyday because I had no other way of making the top behave. Once it got a little longer I stopped. It was then that I decided that I was going to let it grow.  The less heat the better.  About texture, something you cannot see in the pictures is that I have two very distinct textures. The top hair is straight with wavy ends, the back hair is wavy all the way to the root. If I do a half ponytail the difference is very clear. About hair removal, electrolysis is cheaper and probably more effective than laser. I found BIG price differences between spas, so shop around. I had laser done on my face for about $100 and electrolysis for about $50. I know this varies depending where you live.   ",

I am almost four years from PFC, the hair on my head is very long, the hair strands are thinner and I have less quantity compared to before BC, but I still have a lot of hair. The hair on my body is another story, I got a couple of bikini laser hair removal sessions in the past, now I do not have to. I shave my legs every couple months and there is one hair here and there. The hair in my arms is very thin, hardly noticeable. The only hair that still grows and is thick is the one under the arms, since my workout involves lifting my arms (Bodypump), I shave almost everyday. My face got hairy right after finishing chemo, so I had laser done, probably did not need to, but it bothered me so much. These days I get electrolysis on my upper lip about once per year for maybe 30 minutes. Overall, It is nice not worry about body hair. I am 52 so it might be a combination of menopause and all the stuff we have been through. In the past I have always had lots of thick dark hair everywhere, the woolly mammoth would have been envious.",

Keep in mind that I am short so the hair looks longer on me. My prior hair was very very straight. Sorry the pictures are not the best quality. Here is a link to the earlier days.    I am lifting the top hair so you can see that underneath the back is more wavy than the top and it is not frizzy. I basically have two textures. ",
