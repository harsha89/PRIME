If I knew if I would need radiation even with mastectomy I'd opt for lumpectomy if possible but I won't know until after surgery of course. Tough decision!

It is looking like I will be doing a nipple sparing left UMX (or BMX if the mass found during my MRI in the right breast turns out to be cancer too) with immediate direct to implant reconstruction. I will talk to my surgeons about getting back to kickboxing again some day. Did you do a lumpectomy? I might still be a candidate for that but I am leaning towards UMX to hopefully avoid radiation. I fear if I do a lumpectomy with radiation and come back carrying the gene after radiation my reconstruction might be hard if I need a BMX. And I am notreally a candidate for any flap reconstructions since I have no extra cushion at all.",

My mom was an eight year survivor of breast cancer with three tumors in one breast (the largest around 2.5cm). She passed away from something unrelated. So, she would have kept thriving! My doctors were trying to get me to have a lumpectomy and rads too. I have opted for a nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction, and I want the other one done later too. It is totally a personal choice though. Have you done genetic testing? Also, do you know what your BIRADS score is on the other tumor? 50/50 is an interesting comment, and most come back as benign. I had a lump in my other breast too that required a biopsy (it was found in my post-diagnosis MRI). It was benign, lumps and bumps are common. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a benign finding for you on the other side,and clear nodes for us both, and all others awaiting surgery and/or results.",

They're supposed to call me this afternoon with the time. My chemo is aduvant and doesn't start until August, so this is truly the first big step in ridding my body of the cancer. I had a full blown panic attack on Saturday. Tunnel vision, cold sweat and my mind was going 100 mph. That was fun. I was getting ready to take my children to a birthday party for a friend's 5-year old and I just couldn't see myself pretending nothing was wrong to all the people at the party and, well, I lost it. My husband ended up taking them and I did yoga and took the dog for a walk. I worked through it. I did call the oncologist office and they told me to call my primary care physician to report it and see if there is anything they can prescribe. I said I don't have a primary care doctor, I don't get sick. Before cancer I truly never got sick. My family doctor retired to florida about 10 years ago and I can count on one hand the number of times I've been sick in those 10 years. I see my ob/gyn once a year and that's about it. We picked blueberries yesterday and finally told the kids about my surgery and the \"bump\" in my breast. We told them that I'd need lots of help for the next few weeks and they'd be staying with their grandparents for a few days. Also told them that I'd be getting some medicine that \"might\" make me lose my hair. My 8-year old was like \"how much might? You might not, right?\" Then she went on to say that I should probably try not to lose it (my hair). This is my first day out of work. I'm calm now. I have an appointment later this afternoon with the plastic surgeon to get marked for surgery. Then I have to take a shower tonight with the special soap and another tomorrow morning. Question for those who have already gone through surgery- did you wash your hair both times? I'd like to wash it in the shower tonight and then blow dry it so that I can get all the knots and curls out. I'm afraid I won't have time to do that in the morning.",

I know how rough things have been for you and shingles are so painful. My husband had them a couple of years ago and he was in agony. twills, I'm so sorry you had to have the expander removed. I know you were hoping they could salvage it. It seems like treatment is never ending, doesn't it? Kae, it stinks that you're still in so much pain. My pain had improved, but the te's are still very uncomfortable and I'll be stuck with them for at least 5 months I am doing much better since the infection. After I got out of the hospital, I was on 2 oral antibiotics. I finished the levoquin on Saturday and still have 5 days of the doxycycline left. I saw the ps today and had my second fill - he had suspended fills for the past 3 weeks due to the infection. I'm still very flat and I think the tissue expanders are so uncomfortable. I'll get one more fill next week and then stop for chemo. So I'll have these flat, hard kidney bean shaped rocks for 5 months before he resume filling and then the exchange. I had my chemo port put in on Friday and I,start chemo next Friday. I'm terrified but will get through it. I haven't gone back to work yet because the infection set things back. I plan to try to go back after my first chemo depending on how I feel. Did you ladies who had chemo before surgery work during chemo?",

I heard I might not go in until early afternoon so I'm not sure how late it will be before I wake up. I also had knee surgery, acl reconstruction- which was the worst thing that's ever happened to before bc. Every time I've had anesthesia I've thrown up violently. I got sick after my wisdom teeth were taken out, after waking up from knee surgery and during the epidural when my first child was born. It was so bad with my son that when I had my daughter I decided to go without the epidural so that I wouldn't be vomiting like I did with my first. I have had a few moments where I just want to call it all off. Happy birthday lifeisgood!",

My biggest complaint is the surgical tape they used to attach the drains.

On Saturday, we had family and one of my sons friends over for his 11th birthday. My sister in laws did all the prep and clean up. I felt great all day but I hit a wall around 8 on Saturday night and slept about 12 hours! Then I was in a lot of pain yesterday with those odd stabbing pains. It's weird because the pain seems to be in the middle of the tissue expander where there used to be breast tissue. I find out Wednesday what the chemo plan is. im getting nervous for that. Hope you are doing well and no pain! Edited to add- Kae yes I have the tightness too. Sometimes it's tighter than others but it doesn't hurt. It's a strange feeling. My ps has me wearing a surgical bra that I think is really uncomfortable. I've been wearing another low impact sports bra too because it doesn't hurt like the one he wants me to wear. I am going back to work next week and I'm wondering what bra I'm going to wear. Are you all able to put shirts on over your head? I started this weekend and it is not uncomfortable. I'm able to raise my arms and reach easier than bending over to pick things up from the ground. My dad brought me one of those grabber things because I can't pick things up from the ground. Lol. At least not comfortably.",

      "Content": "Jun 24, 2017 02:39AM - edited Jun 24, 2017 03:18AM by toughcookie_21 Edited to add- sorry if this is TMI! I don't know where else to ask questions like this. My surgery is scheduled for July 18 and by my calculations, I'm due to get my period on July 19 give or take a day or two. I have 2 concerns: 1) My periods are ridiculously heavy and 2) I typically have terrible PMS with breast soreness for several days leading up to my period. I have brought both of these issues up to my OB/GYN and PCP in the past, but they have both told me that it is perimenopause and that it will go away eventually and unless I'm willing to take hormonal birth control, I have to deal with it. I don't do well on hormonal birth control and thankfully, I haven't taken them up on that option considering I've had an ER/PR+ tumor growing in my breast for who knows how long. I'm curious here has ever had surgery while on your period and what did they do about the bleeding while you were in surgery? My second question is- what does everyone think about the breast tenderness and soreness and having surgery while my hormones are obviously so out of whack that they cause that much pain. My BC is hormone receptor positive! I mentioned this to the surgical oncologist and they said that the breast soreness is not a concern. They looked at me like I was nuts when I asked about having my period too. I can't imagine that I'm the first person to experience this.",

I guess the chemo makes it hard for your body to heal quickly. I didn't notice any swelling in my arm but I ended up calling the MO office early this week because I was so worried about lymphedema. The nurse practitioner at my MO office took measurements of my right arm so that I will know if lymphedema starts. I'm going to be super careful with that arm to prevent it. I am finally feeling better from the first chemo session. Just in time for the second one next week. I still have diarrhea every day but the accompanying stomach pains are better.

My surgeon recommended lumpectomy and rads but I opted for an MX. That's great that you get to see a surgeon that fast. I didn't get booked until after my biopsy results were in. Keep in mind that even with birads 5 it isn't cancer until the biopsy says it is.:) Someone has to fall in the 5% not cancer. I have had so many appointments all over the city at this point since I was diagnosed. It will feel like a whirlwind but it will slow down. I worked right up until the night before my surgery and there were days where I'd have to leave for hours of appointments, but it trickles off. When I received my diagnosis I was alone, I'm 33 I found the lump assuming it was a fibroid or something. Seems not! Now I usually bring someone with me to appointments, unless a follow-up with the PS. And take notes and write down questions before hand as you think of them. Anyhow, if you have any questions let me know. My breast and plastic surgeon were great. I finally get to meet medical oncology tomorrow. I have also attended a Breast Cancer Action support group in the area, they typically mention it at the group pre-op session at the Breast Health Centre if you attend, but if you want more info let me know. The psychological dept at the Irving Greenberg Cancer Centre is also a great resource.",

It was however a very busy and stressful time at work, in my life (my mom had just died and I was renovating a house on my own). So it may have just been a coincidence. I was however anemic years ago, and the fatigue I experienced when anemic was severe, and in line with your symptoms. There are so many things that could cause you to be tired that are way more likely that breast cancer. As Aliceinchvains mentions, even the stress of thinking about the lump could cause added fatigue. And of course most breast lumps turn out not to be breast cancer. It is great you are getting the lump checked out ASAP, however the odds of it not being breast cancer are on your side, so try not to stress out about it (hard, I know). I found a lump in my other breast last week, I got an ultrasound, and it seems it is a clogged milk duct. :)",
