I've joined a bc support group locally and it's been a good experience, but I find that at age 45 I am the youngest one in the room.  No matter what the treatment - lumpectomy, surgery, radiation, chemo - we have all been touched by this horrible disease and should lift each other up and support each other.  I actually had someone on this website who was stage 2 write that she would gladly trade diagnoses with me when I expressed concern about my chances of recurrence with my aggressive type of bc.  It upset me for a while, but then I had to let it go and realize that she was just dealing with her own fears. And yes, some days I do cry, even though I am almost a year out from diagnosis.  But it does get better with time and I'm finding that I think about bc less and less.  Hang in there and know that we are here for each other.",
