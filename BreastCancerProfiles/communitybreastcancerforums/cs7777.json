Regarding the units of prevelance data that I brought up, thanks for your input on that.  To be clear, I wasn't asking you to give me the stats, just suggesting that we need to be careful to include timeframes since that's an important part of the data.  However, your comments about what's measured is just as important.  (I'm a biomedical reseaercher and read literature all the time, so I'm familiar with the need to distinguish such details.)  After reading your note I realize that any compilation of data must include the measurement method, the cutoff/criteria for LE/no LE, as well as the time frame (possibly multiple time points if they were taken), and of course any relevant patient characteristics for the study cohort (e.g. SNB vs ALND etc).  The data just aren't understandable otherwise, nor are they comparable from study-to-study as you say, but they are what they are.  If you're actively trying to survey the available data on prevelance and can use some help let me know (we can PM about it) as I have some time right now and might be able to help. Thanks again - CS",

(Palo Alto CA) by Dr. Stanley Rockson.  He has several studies, but the one I'm participating in is to try to identify blood biomarkers for increased risk or the very beginning of onset of lymphedema.  They take blood and do arm measurements every 6 months.  I've just done one and it only took about 10 minutes once I arrived.  They're studying patients with lymphedema already (a positive control), patients at risk but w/o lymphedema, and people w/o risk of lymphedema (a negative control) over time, and will compare the blood measurements they take to see if they can predict who's at high risk or about to develop LE even if you can't yet see it in the tissues.  You can find Dr. Rockson on the web here: http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/Stanley_Rockson/.  This study isn't listed on that page (not sure when last updated) but you could contact his lab at the phone given if you're interested in participating. I would encourage anyone else who's taking part in LE treatment, biomarker, or diagnosis research studies to post them here, as it could be a valuable resource to others who might like to participate.  CS",

But if you had a radical mastectomy many years ago, you may have had arm swelling, or you may still be at risk for the condition.\"  While both sentences are literally correct, the way its written implies that if you didn't have a radical mastectomy that you don't really need to worry about this. Given the terrible toll LE takes in the BC community, this seems like an inappropriate message to even imply.  While I recognize we don't want fear-mongering either, it seems like these points could be made differently to eliminate that implication.  For example, \"Current methods of breast cancer treatment lower the risk of developing lymphedema, however, the risk is still real.  In addition, if you had a radical mastectomy or other treatments many years ago, you are still be at risk for the condition\".  I see that the moderators are reading this thread and say there's some modification of the LE prevention pages underway.  How to make these suggestions to BCO writers? Regarding the quoting of % of women who get LE, I would like to point out that all these numbers need a time frame attached.  E.g., 5% within one year post-surgery.  W/o the timeframe the data aren't very helpful, since, for instance, a 5% incidence in one year post surgery is a much greater worry than a 5% incidence in 20 years post surgery.  I'm really really impressed by the depth of knowledge of many participants in these LE threads and I'm truly not trying to nitpick, I just point this out because everyone can understand the data will be much more understandable if the timeframes are attached.  Thanks for listening. Regards to all, CS",

Perhaps you could request to unpin that thread so its no longer so prominent until they update the LE pages, since it's sending newbies to out-of-date info.  Or request to modify the post to include a link to the LE step-up speak-out website (or other uptodate LE info) as well.  It was started by someone named Melissa.  Is that a moderator?  You could provide the exact language for the post so it would be easy to make the modification if they're willing.  I'd do this myself but I'm much less informed about LE than many of you on this thread are and am not as able to make the case as you would be.",
