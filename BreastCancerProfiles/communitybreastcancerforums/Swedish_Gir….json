I'm not sure what testing is available for me, since I live in Sweden the healthcare isn't funded by insurance which is normally a very good thing, but it also limits the options. We get very good healthcare for almost free (there is a fee for approximately 150 dollars per year), but if the cost/benefit isn't there, you can't get it. But like I said before, I'm not worried about my sons. They are so young and research will make progress.",

So I'll participate in that one, and have to wait 3-4 months for the result. I don't think there is much more I can do at this time. She said that one of the mutations they will test for have a very high increased risk like the brca ones.",

If you really can't do it your oncologist might be able to change the treatment or just lower the dose. Docetaxel is very effective, but there are other alternatives. Talk with your oncologist, quitting chemo altogether is not necessary even if you choose to not go through with docetaxel. Docetaxel is very hard on you, but also on the cancer... Chemo is hard, and my husband basically had to drag me to one of the treatments, I really didn't want to go. And I have been feeling quite well during treatments compared to many others. It's not uncommon to want to give up. You are almost there. Two more to go.",
