I wouldn't dwell on the veiny part a lot, I think it probably varies from woman and woman, I myself have very veiny breasts. As to your lump question, mine is quite big, feels like two large peas stuck together, although the doctor quoted \"I don't expect there's reason to be concerned\" which has helped me be less nervous about the ultrasound. The mind can do remarkable things to your body, which can inturn freak you out. I can sure tell you that your body can throw strange pains and aches at you which aren't related to your fear, although you should still be aware of them. Bring up your fears about the aches and pains so that you can be reassured. It seems to me that you are looking way too closely for symptoms, I would try not to analyze yourself and let the tests run their course and ask questions.",
