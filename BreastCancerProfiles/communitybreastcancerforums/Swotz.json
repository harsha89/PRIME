Very next day i rushed to my gyn and he asked me to go for an ultrasound and i did. It turned out that i have fiberadenoma at 1'o clock position with a size 2.31 cm. My gyn assured me that it's not dangerous and definitely not a 'C' thing but asked me to go for ultrasound after four months. Second time when i went for the ultrasound, it was still there almost the same size.   Just a week back i noticed that my right breast has gone bit larger than the left one. I am worried to death and on Tuseday i am going for yet another ultrasound. I am so scared. Can it be any serious? P.S: I am just 24 yrs!",
