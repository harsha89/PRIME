She had a lumpectomy and 7 lymph nodes removed.  Because she has the genetic mutation, the doctors wanted to through the book at her. But she refused chemo and radiation and kept her breast. Which was a pretty bad idea considering hereditary cancers can be very aggressive. Now fast forward two years she said she feels great and still believes she dodged a bullet. Then in February she came home from traveling overseas and found a lump in her neck. She went to a doctor and sure enough her cancer was back and in her lymph nodes.  The doctors were finally able to get her to do chemo and radiation but I fear it's too late. She told me she is stage IV but never mentioned if it's metastatic, which finally brings me to my question. Can you be stage IV without it being metastatic? ",
