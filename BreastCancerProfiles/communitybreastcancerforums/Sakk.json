The technician told me my doctor would have the report by the end of the day but that was Thursday. Today is Sunday. I called several times Friday but the results still weren't sent to my family doctor. I spoke to other people and they have told me the radiologist talked to them right after the ultrasound. I'm so worried that it's bad news and they want my family doctor to tell me. Also the radiologist took measurements and then did under my arm. That's worries me because I think she was checking to see if it has spread. I'm very scared Log in to post a reply",
