I guess if you get a port maybe you don't have this problem. Don't worry too much- it's no fun, but nothing's as bad as what you think it'll be... Drink so so much water, all the time, and walk as much as you can, around the house, up and down stairs. Both seem like the worst thing ever when you feel bad, but both help A LOT with the side effects. Take water to chemo with you, drink a lot during. Also before you go in cause in makes it easier to get the IV in. Use some kind of a laxative- I used miralax- it's over the counter and easy to get down. The nausea drugs are very constipating and not only is it sooo unpleasant but the side effects are MUCH less bad if you stay ahead of it. I couldn't believe how much difference it made- I never knew! And call your doctor if you have questions- they should be available for you right now! good luck!  - check out the just diagnosed section for advice threads...",

Nice full head hair tho very curly (was always straight) but that's temporary I hear. My hair is perhaps a tiny bit thinner in the front, my eyebrows are a bit thin, but no one but me would notice and I think that is the estrogen deprivation and not the chemo. One thing that did happen is the regrowth of lashes pushed out the few stragglers that had lasted thru chemo, making it seem like i was losing my lashes still post chemo, but the short ones were nice and full and grew in relatively quickly (easy to say now, i know, it didn't seem quick then). I think permanant hair loss is pretty uncommon- I wouldn't worry too much.",

I mean, I don't know what other people think, but I think we can take it, and help each other through it maybe? I hope so. In any case, I'm here to say that sounds incredibly stressful and anyone would've freaked out. I would've anyway. I looked into these camisoles. They seem good but I think I might just sew some pockets into a tank top for the drains. My insurance won't pay and I bought everything I was told I needed early on in all this but then didn't use a lot of it so I stopped. Some people talk about using a fanny pack for the drains too but I don't know about that. Won't do anything about being flat but I guess I'm just planning on toughing that out by thinking of my nice fake boobs down the line. It's hard to imagine though. I think I'm a lot more freaked out the thought of a whole big part of me just being a numb spot, forever. I know sometimes some sensation comes back but no guarantee... It's not about sex even, just...I don't know. I already feeel so weird about my body now...and it's just getting more and more unfamiliar and strange to me... So yeah.

I wrote it as an email to a few friends and thought it made sense to put here... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So...surgery next week. I waited a long time for it to start to seem real, and I think it finally is.... Now I'm scared. And worried. I'm not afraid that something will happen that isn't supposed to, an accident- what happens if everything goes smoothly is bad enough! I'm scared of recovery, of how much it will probably suck, but I'm sure it will be manageable. I mean, it will suck. But I imagine it will be like chemo- a really scary unknown, but when it's happening, you mostly just deal with it. I'm scared of being in the hospital, after last time was so terrible, when I was hospitalized during chemo. I definitely have a lot of trauma around that, mostly un-dealt with (there's just been so much else to think about). I hope this time will be different. And I've arranged things so I won't have to be alone at all, which will make me less scared I hope. A lot of the trauma I experienced before had to do with being powerless and neglected and not having anyone there to help me. But that experience definitely makes it harder to face this. But mostly I just hate that I'm signing up for something that I really don't want to do! I know I've talked to some of you about this before, but I just can't get past it- having to choose these terrible things. It almost makes it worse! Because I know that in theory, I could say no. I could stop or refuse any treatment or intervention. But I don't feel like that's an option, at all. So it just puts me in a situation where I don't feel I have a choice, yet I feel like I should be more okay than I am with these things because at least it's my decision. I would never choose to have surgery at all, but especially I would never, ever, in a reasonable world, choose to mutilate my body, which I really genuinely love- and hey! have become attached to!- in this way. I am looking at the bright side. I can expect a cosmetically very good result. I can expect a medically good result. I probably won't get lymphedema. I probably won't get MRSA. I will get over it and get used to it and deal. In the old days, if they suspected breast cancer, they would take you in for a surgical biopsy immediately- while you were knocked out, they would get the results- if it was negative, they'd sew you back up. But if it was cancer, they'd do a radical mastectomy on the spot. No consent, no time to prepare, nothing. In the really old days, they'd try to burn out the tumor with chemicals which would burn a hole in your body, and then you'd die anyway because it didn't work. I know how lucky I am. Even these days, today, in most parts of this country (I don't know anything about breast cancer care internationally) people are given many fewer options than I have been, surgically- many women fly far from home to get less advanced surgery than is offered as a matter of course here in SF. But I'm sad and stressed out. So I thought I'd share a little and see if it helped. Next Tues, when I'm in surgery, and then in the hospital overnight, please think of me. Send me luck and wishes that I don't get lymphedema or MRSA, two real nightmare scenarios, and that everything goes really really well. Thank you!",

If it's nothing, great, but if it is a problem, waiting until the end of your pregnancy could be a really serious mistake!",

It sounds to me like there isn't much medical necessity fot the bi-mx, and like you know that, but that you want to do this anyway. Well, why shouldn't you? If you were acting out of fear, I would think you should not. But it sounds to me as if you're saying you don't feel that attached to your breasts anyway, or invested in having them, so why not take care of this problem in one fell swoop? I don't necessarily think that not being very invested in your boobs is a body image problem. You should be aware though, that without reconstruction mx are not just being flat chested- there's concavity, and scarring... You should look at pictures. They are possible to find online. And of course, you can also do reconstruction. Use this opportunity to have the boobs you always wished you had- I am! (and you won't have to worry about them changing size anymore that's for sure!) Do you have to decide right away? If you have to rush into surgery, can you do less now and retain the option of more drastic surgery when you've had more time to think it through? (btw yes, you do probably have this option) As someone who has just this minute been dianosed, you're in a really intense place with a lot of fear and strain- it's still scary for me, further along, but I doubt I'll ever feel like that again. And you probably won't either- so take it easy, think about it and if you still feel it's what you want, you have my full support. good luck!!!",

Is this b/c of the kind of surgery or does it reflect differences in who makes what choices? It's complicated and hard to say, but if one is opting towards havin both breasts off despite it feeling really hard to make that decision, this does suggest that it might not be worth that sacrifice.",

I hadn't thought about this board in a while, but here you all are, so I think maybe I'll ask you about the question that's been on my mind lately. I had an ooph. in Oct 2009, my Bi-mx in apr 2010, (like the rest of you), and got expanders at the time (I had already done chemo), had exchange surgery in Aug thinking it would be the last one, but it was awful. They just did a terrible job!So I found a new surgeon and had One More surgery in Dec 2011. I promised myself I would be happy with the results no matter what and not put myself through that anymore (I had been having an increasingy harder time bouncing back from the surgeries- the last two I was in really really bad shape afterwards. I just can't even describe how terrible I felt) and they look...better. They're pretty ok, i guess. But I'm not happy with them, and I still feel like I have to moniter what I wear all the time and there are so many kinds of clothes I can't wear because I have to hide the fact that they look kind of not right. I love having boobs! I didn't decide on reconstruction for no reason! I don't want to hide them! But is it worth more surgery (and the accompanying increasing risk of infection and real disaster)? Imagine how unhappy I'd be if I went for it and got an infection and lost one of the implants!! So if anyone has feedback, please- I'm all ears.",

It sounds like they have reasons for what they're recommending for you, but you should find out what they are! I had the neo-adjuvant chemo (pre-surgery) and was really hapy with that decision as it made it possible to track the progress of the chemo. But if it's non-agressive and smaller you may not need chemo at all, which they could only determine by doing surgery, so this is probably why they want to. You should ask ask ask whatever you want to know! if your dr is too busy or hard to reach, find an RN you can talk to in their office. As far as staging and stuff, they didn't tell me either- I was asking for copies of everything and found that stuff in reports on my own. I think some people don't want to know and they have a thing about waiting for you to ask. I didn't want to know at first. Good luck  first week ladies!!",

Perhaps the TE is pushing on a tendon, or causing you to move/hold yourself differently, or to sleep in a weird position that is pinching something? Us FM sufferers have such senstitive ligaments and tendons-- I've seen it theorized that they are more dry and frayable, less elastic. So something that was fine for someone else could cause problematic damage for us, sadly. If I were you I would pay attention to whether it gets worse with use, and if so, talk to a PT!

Sorry it's so long!   Anti-HIV Drugs Inhibit Emerging Virus Linked to Prostate Cancer, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Four drugs used to treat HIV infection can inhibit a retrovirus recently linked to prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, researchers at Emory University/Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the University of Utah have shown. The results were published on April 1, 2010 by the journal PLoS One. The findings suggest that if XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) is proven to be a cause for prostate cancer or chronic fatigue syndrome, those illnesses may be treatable with drugs already approved for treating HIV. Discovered in 2006, XMRV has been detected in some prostate cancer patients' tumor biopsies by several investigators. However, its precise role in driving prostate cancer is unclear. A recent report (from the Whittemore Peterson Institute in Nevada) detected XMRV in a majority of chronic fatigue syndrome patients, but these results have not been confirmed by other laboratories. \"Not all studies that have looked for XMRV have been able to detect it in prostate cancers or in samples from chronic fatigue syndrome,\" says Ila Singh, MD, PhD, associate professor of pathology at the University of Utah School of Medicine. \"We will need to see the results of clinical trials before these drugs can be used in a clinical setting.\" Singh and Raymond Schinazi, PhD, DSc, professor of pediatrics and chemistry at Emory's Center for AIDS Research and the Atlanta VAMC, and colleagues teamed up to test 45 anti-HIV compounds, some of these discovered by Emory researchers, and other antiviral compounds against XMRV in cell culture. The most potent drug against XMRV was raltegravir, produced by Merck and sold under the commercial name Isentress. The FDA initially approved raltegravir in 2007 only for persons whose HIV infection was resistant to other drugs, but in 2009 its approval was expanded to all HIV infected persons. Raltegravir represents a new class of antiretroviral drugs because it inhibits the integrase enzyme, preventing the virus from invading a cell's DNA. Other drugs against HIV inhibit either the reverse transcriptase enzyme, which copies the virus' genetic information, or the protease enzyme, which carves up newly produced viral proteins so that viruses can be assembled. However, none of the protease inhibitors inhibited XMRV in culture. Besides raltegravir, three other compounds -- another integrase inhibitor and AZT and tenofovir DF, two reverse transcriptase inhibitors -- also inhibit XMRV replication. This suggests that these drugs could be used together in combination therapy, a particularly effective tactic against HIV that helps prevent the emergence of drug-resistant forms of the virus. \"Our study showed that these drugs inhibited XMRV at lower concentrations when two of them were used together, suggesting that highly potent 'cocktail' therapies might inhibit the virus from replicating and spreading,\" Schinazi says. \"This combination of therapies might also have the added benefit of delaying or even preventing the virus from mutating into forms that are drug-resistant.\" Although both XMRV and HIV are retroviruses, there is little similarity between HIV and XMRV at the protein level. Scientists have been able to show that several retroviruses cause cancer in animals, but only a few retroviruses are known to infect humans: human T-lymphotropic viruses 1 and 2, HIV, and now XMRV. Singh and Schinazi are now investigating the development of resistance in XMRV to raltegravir and other drugs. Singh led a recently published study that demonstrated the presence of XMRV in 27 percent of prostate cancers examined, with the virus more likely to be found in the most-aggressive tumors. XMRV may promote cancer by integrating into the host cell DNA and warping the cell's regulation of its own genes. Anti-HIV Drugs Show Activity against XMRV Retrovirus Linked to Prostate Cancer and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome SUMMARY: The integrase inhibitor raltegravir (Isentress) and certain other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV are also active against xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV), a distantly related retrovirus thought to play a role in prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, according to a study described in the April 1 2010? issue of the open-access journal PLoS One. By Liz Highleyman XMRV is is classified as a gammaretrovirus, belonging to the same broad family as HIV, but more closely related to a group of viruses that cause cancers such as leukemia. Identified in 2006, XMRV has been linked to prostate cancer, and last fall researchers reported in Science magazine that more than 60% of individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome carried XMRV in peripheral blood cells. XMRV was the subject of a plenary presentation and an oral abstract session at the recent 17th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI 2010). Researchers from the University of Utah and Emory University tested 45 compounds, including 28 drugs approved for human use, for activity against XMRV in a laboratory study. They found that 4 anti-HIV drugs -- raltegravir, tenofovir (Viread, also in the Truvada and Atripla coformulations), zidovudine (AZT; Retrovir), and the experimental integrase inhibitor L-000870812 -- also inhibited XMRV replication. When used together, these agents exhibited synergistic effects, offering the potential for combination therapy to delay the emergence of drug resistance. However, the study authors noted, XMRV has limited genetic diversity compared with HIV, indicating less capacity to develop drug resistance mutations, and suggested that 2 drugs may be adequate; notably, they were unable to select for raltegravir-resistant XMRV after trying for several months. \"While it is not yet clear if any illnesses are directly caused by XMRV, our data indicates that XMRV infections might be prevented or treated with specific antiviral agents,\" they concluded. \"In the presence of any evidence of causality of human disease, our findings should provide the basis for designing clinical trials to treat them.\" Below is the text of a press release from Emory University that provides more details about the study and its findings.

There's no getting around it though- the treatments might be worse for us, but you still have to do them! I will tell you, however, that despite having pretty serious chemical sensitivities, I did not react that way to chemo. I had a hard time, a lot of fatigue, but not abnormally I don't think- just on the hard end of the regualr spectrum. And I haven't had any pain/reaction to my silicone implants. But how to know? If you feel okay, treatment-wise, about the lumpectomy option, it seems like a good way to bypass that worry. And you can always change your mind later and have the bigger surgery- many women do it that way. I think it's fabulous that you have an allergenist that acknowledges that you might react to the implants- it's so common to just have those (legitimate) fears brushed off and discredited! During chemo I took A LOT of supplements and herbs and I think it really helped- I'm still on a lot of what I started then and my fibro is actually less bad now than it has been in years. I went to a place called the Pine Street Clinic-   pinestreetclinic.com/?page_id=17 - it is in my area but they did everything by fax anyway, so maybe anyone can go through them. They specialize in complementary care for people going through conventional cancer treatment and have really researched this stuff, ie what you can and can't do during chemo for best results. I would recommend it to anyone trying to figure this stuff out. It is sort of expensive, but they have a sliding scale. And I agree with Barbe- let your onc and whoever else know about your fibro/any symptoms- who knows- they might be really sensitive and helpful! I know my onc is good about that stuff- because he sees so many of us :(. And as for being \"too healthy\"- perhaps you should let your dr know that FM appears to be caused be a virus and can hapen to anyone!!",

It's easier for the hospitals/nurses, but it doesn't make a difference to your treatment protocol- just tell them you don't want it! Unless you had lymh nodes out on both sides, in which case you would need to I suppose, but that seems unlikely. The advantages are (as I'm sure you know and they keep telling you) that you don't have to get an IV each time, which is hard- since you had surgery already, if you had any lymph nodes removed, they won't be able to use an IV on that side, which will make things harder for you. I made it through chemo without a port, but without being able to switch arms it would have been very difficult- even with both, it was not good by the end, and we were down to having to use the wrist/hand sometimes while my other veins rested. If you have a hard time with your veins already, or difficulty dealing with them digging around for a vein (not that anyone doesn't have an issue with this, but I really gained an immunity after all this. I don't even flinch at blood draws anymore, and I was always squeamish pre-cancer!) you might want to think about whether you'll end up with a port 1/2 way through anyway, in which case so much better to go ahead and get it over with, both so you don't have to recover from the insertion surgery during chemo (infection risk) and to spare yourself going through all that and then having to do it anyway. But that said, like I said I didn't get a port and I did just fine, through 6 months of chemo. So if that's what you want, fight for it! I really don't think they can make you. I'm sorry you feel discouraged. Who can blame you? It is hard to always have to do all our advocating for ourselves! But it seems that is just how it is. Maybe some bra shopping (soon) will cheer you up!",

And switched oncs. I'm not saying you need to do that- but you should certainly get a 2nd opinion. Everyone should anyway! Insurance will pay, and all oncs are different- the more information we have, the better to make decisions with. I personally can't see why you should need the DD with your dx, but if there is a reason, a 2nd dr would say the same, and then you'd know. I did regular doses, couldn't tolerate it and had to cut it almost in half, and had a terrific response to chemo- so more isn't everything. your body has to work hard too, and keeping it able to do so isn't trivial.  By the long term pill, I assume you mean the tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors? People do have SE issues with those- I am on them (femara) and have had a hard time with SEs off and on (am currently on, again, a reduced dose) but oddly not the increased pain that I had expected, despite having the fibro. So, it's unpredictable- you may not have problems at all. I'd say, hope for the best, and if it doesn't happen that way, deal with it then. Just do what you can to get through chemo for now- it's miserable and stupid, and the other stuff won't seem as bad after you've dealt with that. This board is so helpful for chemo tips though, you'll see. you can cut your SEs in half just by getting the benefit of everyone's experiences and tips.  I don't know about marijauna. I meant to try it- even got some- but never did. I have always hated the feeling of it so much- it makes me anxious- that I'd be miserable with nausea but still not try it it because i'd get afraid of being more miserable. Not very encouraging; sorry. On the other hand, I know people who take it for anxiety and Fibro pain and swear by it so who knows? Maybe give it a test run before you need it? Good luck!

Coincidentally, or not, my D levels are now up to 70 from a dx era 20-something. So definitely worth a try! (PS-hi kate!)",

I feel like I went to school for this stuff sometimes! Re: menopause. Oh yeah. Fun, huh? I will say this though- I do not miss the monthly pre-menstrual inflammation and corresponding increase in pain. It would start getting worse 2 weeks, sometimes only 1 week after my period, gradually worsening until I bled. I would run around like crazy the week after my period trying to do everything while I was pain free enough to be able to! Now- better all the time! There are other things contributing I think, but it's a big piece. I thought for sure it was my thyroid but we tested and tested and tested and i have finally accepted that I guess it really isn't. I do have a lot of the same symptoms though- well the fatigue mostly. In my case I think it's actually neurological, and adrenal. But who really knows?",

I believe that I experience, basically, phantom pain in the nerves in my muscles (among other things). My fibro pain tends to be unrelated to actual muscle or joint stress, and be triggered by less obvious things, of which I can't think of a good example right now for some reason, but I'm sure you all can relate to the pain for no apparent reason experience. My thyroid was tested extensively, and I too questioned the tests when they came back neg b/c it seemed so clear- my PCP finally said (and she had been pretty convinced it was hypo-thyroidism too) that I was actually testing HYPER thyroid (not enough to matter, but enough to convince her that that was not what was going on). And the fibro dx makes more sense anyway- I have so many symptoms that are more CFS than anything, and I have the chemical sensitivities (common w/ the fibro and CFS). I think a common thread between the two, though is ADRENAL FATIGUE which is also such a huge problem for us BC patients (causing long time post chemo fatigue, for example).  MAGOB- CFS= chronic fatigue syndrome- sort of a sister complex, in my opinion,(as someone who suffers from what seems to be a hybrid of the 2) to fibromyalgia. They share a lot of common ground, but manifest differently.",

She was kind of stumped by my special problems (too much fatigue and pain to do what she wanted to recommend). I feel better than I have in years these days and I'm so proud of myself for being able to do so much- I can walk fast on the treadmill, almost every day, and even run some, and go on bike rides sometimes!!- it's depressing to be reminded how messed up I really am, still.

But you know, just because things are a symptom of fibro doesn't mean everyone has all of them! I sleep ok often and never wake up stiff, but I definitely have fibro. With the lymph node enlargement, though, it sounds more like Chronic Fatigue, or some mish mash of the 2- which is kind of how I experience mine. I call it fibro but it took years to settle on a dx b/c in some ways it was CFS-y and in others fibro-y and neither quite exactly... there's a lot of gray area. Honestly though? It sounds like lyme! Can you get a second (or 3rd, 4th?) opinion? The hard thing about the fibro/CFS set of problems is that while the onset of symptms is brought on by something external (an injury or illness, it could have been the BC) removing that doesn't make them go away. It seems they are just dormant in your system (us lucky few!) but once activated it's very very hard to to turn back off. Not much good news in all this but I hope it's useful at least? And remember- it's not the cancer spreading! It just isn't. When you have aches and pains already it's hard not to think so sometimes, but you know it isn't- just turn those thought off!!!",

I sincerely hope it was a one time thing and I can now just be much more vigilant, because I just can't take it. The idea of another chronic, no cure condition...well you all understand, right? I kind of can't face the possibility. So I'm still in denial. The swelling has gone down, and maybe it will be okay....But yes, I am taking it seriously and dealing with it. But I just...my feelings about adding this to the list of things wrong with me.... Disabling tendonitis, both arms. Fibro. Chemical sensitivities. BC. BRCA+. PLUS lymphedema? I'm 37 years old, I should be, you know, young and healthy! On the BC front- I might get switched from femara to tamox. I actually feel pretty excited about this. I might, could it be, maybe...want to have sex again?? It sounds too good to be true...",
