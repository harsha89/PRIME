I am a 35 year old african american female, I was diagnosed with invasive stage 1 and insitu stage 0 in jan 2013 in the left breast. The cancer was ER+/PR+/HER2-, I had two lumpectomies in which we achieved a 4mm clear margin, thank GOD for his blessings, I am now having chemo once a week for 12 weeks(Taxol), then the big 3 for 4 treatments, then rads for 4 weeks, then tamoxifen for 5 years. I've had two chemo treatments and so far so good, no major issues, seems normal, just a little tired at times. I'm a police officer and the only time ive taken off has been for a week with the surgeries. Ive still been patolling the streets feeling fine. I recieved the results of my genetic testing which advised no mutations found, thats BRCA1&2, thank GOD for his blessings, I have three beautiful daughters, that my husband and I are raising, and I'm glad to know there are no DNA mutations. Back to my chemo, I had very long beautiful hair, that always grew fast. I cut my hair to about 1/2 inch all over (it's quite cute on me) just in case it started to fall out. Well I haven't lost any as of yet, I hope I don't, but if I do, so what, its hair, it will grow back, I love my life more than I will ever love my hair. I want to do the blog thing,I just need to figure out how to get started with it, I want to share my story, my journey, this brief walk with breast cancer. As far as I'm concerned, we all became survivors when we were diagnosed and decided we were going to fight!!!!",
