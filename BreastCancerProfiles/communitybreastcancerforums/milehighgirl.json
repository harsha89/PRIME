I bought a bottle of the Boswellia and began taking it on Sunday.  The instructions are to take one tablet three times a day (330mg).  I took two the first day.  One mid-day and one at bedtime.  It seemed to take about an hour to kick in but the pain did subside.  Since then, I've noticed that it still takes about an hour for it to work but now four days later, I still have low grade pain.  Not enough to be debilitating but enough to remind me that it's there.  I did start taking it with tumeric two days ago but I didn't notice much of a change. My question for those of you taking this, does it take a while for the Boswellia to get into your system so it works all the time?  Does it take a day, a week, a month?  Does the regular dose work for 4-hours or more?  How often do you take it on a daily basis? Do I need to up the dose to four tablets or more a day?  I've had no side effects from taking it three times a day. I am so hoping this will be a winner for me and welcome any and all suggestions you might have! Thanks so much.  Blessings. Sue Log in to post a reply",
