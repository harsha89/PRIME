The doctor said from the time I walk in the door to the time I leave, it shouldn't take more than 20 minutes. Door to Door from my house, add another 20 minutes. So just 40 minutes per day. But sometimes I feel that it is all I think about and can be so consuming and I have to push myself to do things. Shorten - sunburn on your neck? Was this expected?",

I didn't even want to do radiation therapy. I read an article and seriously thought about refusing rads until I researched recurrence statistics. That scared me.

I read somewhere you see your MO for the rest of your life. Really? That depressed me. I also would have made a concerted effort to find the right MO instead of just agreeing with the Surgeon who suggested him. ",

I was happy it was done but got very emotional when I got off the table. When I got home my husband asked me if crying was another side effect of rads. This whole experience is still surreal to me. Even after four months (from diagnosis) I'm still in a form of denial and would like to put this whole experience behind me but it continues with Hormone Therapy and follow up doctors appointments. But it could be much worse and for that I count my blessings and vow to give back. There is a local organization that makes up gift bags (mints, water, magazine) for chemo patients. They need donations and I will be going to Walmart. My breast is tanned with the boost area a bright red. It's swollen but it looks good! Some zings from time to time and sore nipple but overall ok. Sorry Elem that you are uncomfortable and in pain. I'm sending you hugs and hope that the pain fades. Do you feel there is some improvement from day to day? The photos you posted are gorgeous. I'm sure being on that beautiful beach helped a bit. Let us know when you start Tamoxifen and how it goes for you. Has anyone started Tamoxifen yet? I thought someone on this thread was starting.... Pamela - 2 more weeks - it will fly by! All of you helped more than you can know. Thanks so much....I will be sending good wishes to all of you. Will always check in here but will probably meander over to the Hormone Therapy Boards for the next step. PS -- Saw Chris Botti last night (great way to celebrate end of rads). What a show! Not sure if any of you are fans (I love jazz, but trumpet, not so much) but he puts on a good show. ",

I was scheduled for a week of boosts but the RO changed it to 7 saying although my margins were clear they weren't as wide as they would like (if I'm understanding correctly). When I met with my Surgeon she said I only needed 3 weeks of radiation therapy but that all changed when I met with my MO and RO. We are on the same schedule, I see my RO today as well. ",

Having said that, you never know what cancer cells are lurking about, and I'll do whatever I can to avoid reoccurrence. I was told if I had a positive node I would need chemo.",
