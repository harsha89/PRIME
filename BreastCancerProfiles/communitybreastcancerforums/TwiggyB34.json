The tumor is 1.3cm and positioned 7oclock right breast and this tumor was the one that was biopsied with fine needle 3 months ago result was inconclusive. It seems to have concerned him more than the rest of the 8 of the tumors. The 8 others did look nicer than the one he wants to focus on. This one looked like ot had a T in middle with some clouds. He insisted thebother tumors will have to ve monitored closely. Im guessing im waisting my time with core biopsy on this one tumor too.",

This did not put it to rest as i expected. I was then referred to breast specialist for recommendation and his recommendation was wait 3 months for follow up ultrasound and mammogram if needed and go from there. This morning i had the ultrasound done and the same lesion/mass is still there and 5 new mass has been found easily and they were sure none are cysts so a total of 6. No pain no nothing. All surprises and new since last ultrasound in late February this year. I also have 2 new and 1 existing in my left breast as well. I was sent for mammogram straight after. This morning for my doctors appointment (appointment was for something else entirely different matter) she has mentioed that she had already got the report for mammogram and images from yesterday and all are solid tumors and \"suspected\" fibroadenomas but my doctor said the mammogram report isnt 100% so i just have to wait to see my breast specialist again and see what he says. Most likely core biopsies as that is the best way to confirm if it is fibroadenomas or not and my last biospy which was fine needle biospy was inconclusive so have to see what breast specialist recommends. I see him Tuesday afternoon. I hope nothing serious and comes back begnin. My aunty died of breast cancer tht spread to brain in december last year just before christmas and my mother had early stages in her early 30s but thats it. Im 34 so i dont think i will have anything sinister. Log in to post a reply",

I like your thinking to call the shots for once and for all to get to the bottom of it. My biopsy back in February came bsck inconclusive with blood cells which doc said it meant the radiologist at the time thought it was a cyst but was infac a solid tumor and i should have had a core biopsy not fine needle aspiration. So instead had ultrasound and mammogram done on 17th 2 days ago which confirmed same tumor biopsied still there plus all new other once all 6 in right and 2 new ones on left. The left one first was found near my armpit that is 13mm. Biggest out of them all apparently. I was happy that report for mammogram was already sent same day in afternoon as my scans were done in morn. Tuesday arvo i see breast surgeon for his thoughts and recommendation. My doctor said it will either be core biopsy on all of them or excisional. I dont think it will be excisional as thees to many and i honestly think to many for it to be cancer?",
