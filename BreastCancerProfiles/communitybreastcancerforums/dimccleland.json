I found a lump in my left breast three weeks ago but as I was going away on holiday, I didn't do anything about it. I thought it might just be a blocked duct or a reaction to the medication I take for Ankylosing Spondylitis and that it would go away on its own but it didn't. I saw my gynae on Saturday who immediately sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound and, sure enough, there it was, a \"probably carcinoma\". I saw the breast surgeon today for a biopsy and to quote her, \"it feels like cancer, it reacts to the biopsy needle like cancer and it bleeds like cancer so I am almost 100% sure it is cancer\"!! My ultrasound shows no lymph node involvement although my surgeon seems to think there might be one node that is affected. Next steps biopsy results, PET scan, MRI and lymph node biopsy ... absolutely terrified at this point!!

I have IDC in my left breast and my tumour aka \"The Beast\" is a whopping 8cm!! She has recommended that I have a course of chemo first and surgery later. I must admit that, initially, I just wanted the tumour gone but listening to her today, I think that I am comfortable with her recommendation. My PET scan is scheduled for Sunday and I see the oncologist on Tuesday next week so, hopefully, after that visit the full plan will be in place and I can start taming the monster :-) Hugs xx",

I was diagnosed with TN lung and lymph node mets in mid-July this year not even six weeks after I had finally finished all my treatment following my initial diagnosis in December 2014. My diagnosis was made following a routine check-up with my oncologist where I happened to mention that I was feeling generally unwell - I had put it down to the summer heat here in the Middle East and, also, the fact that I had just finished 18 months of treatment. She decided to do a CT scan as a precaution. My last CT-scan in February of this year was clear so neither of us were really expecting anything. However, the scan showed numerous nodules spread over both lungs and, also, numerous swollen mediastinal lymph nodes. She followed the CT up with a lung biopsy and PET scan. The PET scan showed multiple enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes on my left side, the largest measuring 0.5cm, multiple nodules scattered through both my left and right lung fields, the largest in the left lingular segment measuring 1.4cm, and multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, the largest measuring 1.6cms plus small pleural effusions on both lungs and in the pericardial area. The lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis and the pathology showed that it was TNBC. I've just completed my first cycle of Abraxane and Avastin - each cycle consists of Abraxane once a week for three weeks with Avastin on week 1 and week 3. I then have a week off. I start my next cycle this coming Wednesday. Once cycle 2 is completed, we will do another PET to check on the progression and if the treatment is working, I will carry on with this delightful cocktail for another 4 to 6 cycles. If its not working, we'll move on to something else. I'm really struggling to come to terms with my diagnosis and the fact that I will likely be on some form of chemo for the rest of my life but I guess I will ge there eventually. I look forward to getting to know you lovely ladies. Take care Di x",

Donna, so sorry to hear you are struggling with a cough. I have also been coughing for about six weeks and my onco referred me to a pulmonologist who has diagnosed me with acute reactive asthma. He says that the lung tumours and the chemo are causing the lining of my lungs to inflame and this is causing the asthma ... we're currently treating it with oral steroids, a steroid inhaler and I am using a nebulizer regularly. Not fun, especially after my 2 month PET showed that I have fractured a rib (from coughing) so now have to have bone density scans etc as the onco is concerned my bones are weakening. My PET was done after two cycles of Avastin and Abraxane and, unfortunately, it doesn't look likes it is working. Some of the larger tumors on my lungs are slightly smaller and less active but there are a number of smaller tumours that have grown and are very active. Also still lots of activity in the mediastinal and subclavicular lymph nodes and new evidence of disease on my thyroid and some inguinal lymph nodes close to my liver. PET also showed changes to the bone marrow in my spine, sacral joints and hip. Was supposed to start Cycle 3 of chemo on Wednesday but the onco has postponed it, she is waiting for a second opinion on the PET which we should have tomorrow and she will then decide what to do. This disease is just so unpredictable. Hope all you lovely ladies have a great weekend. Take care x",

This was the first forum post that \"Dr Google\" brought me too - I have not yet had a confirmed diagnosis and only had my biopsies done today however my doctor feels that I should expect a Stage 2 or 3 diagnosis with the possibility of one or two lymph nodes being involved. The last few days have been absolutely surreal and I feel like I am walking around in a fog - so much to take in and so many decisions will have to be made - quite frankly, I am absolutely terrified but can honestly say that having read your posts has given me a strange sense of comfort. You ladies are fabulous x",
