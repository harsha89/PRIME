I went to my gyn last thursday and had an ultrasound that revealed a 10mm nodule under my nipple.  The radiologist said that he couldn't remove it because it was too close to the surface, so is sending me to surgeon.  He did say that it was round.  Have my first appt with the surgeon tomorrow afternoon.  I am so scared, I am nauseous and pretty non functional.  All I can think of is my 5 and 9 year old kids and how they need me. Sorry - talking about it makes it better and the more informed I am.... Log in to post a reply",

If I wasn't crazy before, I am now! ",
