I was already on a low dose 1500 but man did my cancer take off in the 3 mos I was on the lower dose at 7/7. I did not have an office visit or labs for 3 mos due to a mutual decision with my onc. I was really tired of the every 6 weeks meet and greet. If you opt for 7/7 just insist they give you close f/u. One plus to halaven is I got my hands and feet back so when chemo fatigue isn't bad I can really enjoy my good days and sheets free of bag balm.",

Yes old favorite photos are out on my desk and a few of my mother's newsy notes where now I appreciate how scarred she was as her cea kept climbing. The art and my writings will be for my son and daughter and future generations to someday discover who I became in the final phase of my life. The objects sources for my kids to tell their kids about the blueberry picking, apples, donuts, glacier, Nantucket. Memories now bring sweet peace and healing. Just because my physical self is gone is no reason to shed everything representative of my spirit. I feel yes maybe the young adults have moved on for now but perhaps decades from now they may wish to know their Mother, to hold what she held, cherished and loved.",

I listened to Shirley Metz and she invoked the hiv/aids analogy. I feel it should have guidelines but not like others who want the ribbon represented for uniformity. Like those lost in the early years of hiv/aids the panels represent so much to the people who made them and those lost lives represented. We are so much more than our disease. We are in a war and we don't have a memorial, I only have to think of the children without mothers who bear witness to the collateral damage. During the pink haze month have the quilt on the nfl playing fields. If people gave the cost of one beer to fund metastatic only research maybe alot of children would have more time with their moms. penny",
