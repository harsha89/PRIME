She was diagnosed with IBC, finished chemo in july, radiotherapy in Aug and is on herceptin every 3 weeks. She was not really troubled by this during treatment. Her recent head CT was normal as were her bloods, BP and echo. Has anyone else had a similar experience or any advise to offer. Obviously this is making her very nervous and she is thinking about reoccurence. Please help. Thanks Koo xx PS i will be forever in debt to this site which has given me so much imformation and support as a very close friend  Log in to post a reply",
