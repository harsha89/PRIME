However, I am facing another issue. I just get a new job offer. This is a full time job and  it is one hour driving away from my home. The company is asking me when I can start to work. With the breast cancer comes in, I have no idea when I can be able to work. Assume I need surgery, radiation, chem. Based on your experience, how do you think I am able to have energy to work ---- Is it possible that I am able to work at the end of August? How the radiation.chemo treatment will play on our body (will I be very tired when I get those treatments?) I have another option, which is staying in my current job (but this is a temp part time job.I need to find another job after one year. the new job I found is my dream job ---- I have hoped to work in this position until someday I will retire. I get it, but now I am afraid if I have the energy to keep it at all when I am dealing with the breast cancer. If you are me, which way you will choose? Your inputs are highly appreciated! Thank you.

I am more concerned about if I have energy to work if I am going through all of the treatments. ( maybe my surgery will have be done by the end of August. With Grade 2 IDC, I might need radiation / chemo...) So I am not sure how these will affect my work. Do these treatments take long time to finish or just a couple of hours per day? This is a new job and I am not sure how people will look at me... if I can keep this job.... Thank you.",

I think the treatment is very individual and eveybody's response will be different. I will talk to my doctors and find out what my treatment plan will be. Then I will notify my new employer the whole situation and see if they are willing to work out a feasible schedule for me and for them also. If they agree, that will be so wonderful. If not, I will forget about it. Overall, without the health, everything will be meaningless --- I have to take care of my body first. --- That is my plan. Thank you all so much. All my best wishes to everybody!",
