Here it is: The play by play of my excisional biopsy:  By the way I had a headache all day probably due to no caffeine, water, or food.  They did the wire localization in a mammogram room with a rolling chair.  There were 3 people there.  They did all mammogram compressions while I was sitting.  They took a couple of views and then while compressed, gave me a lidocaine shot.  They then inserted the hollow needle and took a couple more mammo views.  I felt tugging when they played with the needle but not pain.  It took them a few minutes to get the needle right where they wanted it.  Then they stuck the wire in and took 2 more views.  They put the needle through the side even though my stereo was through the top.  They taped the wire down with a gauze pad on top and a lady walked me to the elevators and up to the surgery floor.  I was offered a blanket and I took it because it was freezing there!  I had to wait 45 minutes or more in the waiting room until a pre op bed was available. I had my own little room for pre op where I'd spend the next 4 hours!  I had my vitals taken, medical history questions asked, went to the bathroom twice, they did a urine pregnancy test, and then they inserted an IV (no drugs just fluids).  I took about a 2 hour nap which was awesome! Finally 1 and a half hours past my scheduled time, the surgeon came in the see if I had any questions.  Then the anesthesiologist came in and I told him I wanted twighlight sleep.  Everyone was fine with that. Next a nurse put a shot in my IV to relax me (verced I think).  Then I got wheeled to the OR.  I noticed it was big and drab.  There were 3 people across the room fiddling with equipment.  After that, I don't remember a thing!  I don't remember the surgeon walking in or seeing the anesthesiologist.  I don't remember being wheeled to recovery either.  It was fantastic.  I stayed there for 45 minutes and they gave me apple juice.  My sister in law showed up to take me home.  I was fully alert and dressed myself with no problem.  I only have a 4 by 4 inch gauze pad covered by an even bigger square piece of tape,  I can't take a real shower for 48 hours!  We went through a drive through and I devoured a chicken sandwich.  I was starving!  I don't have hardly any pain right now but I think I'll fill my vicoden prescription just in case. The surgeon didn't mark the box about using ice packs but I am anyway!  I hope that's ok.  I didn't even see the surgeon afterward but a nurse said he said it all went well.  No pain yet but I remember my breast starting to ache 5 hours after the stereotactic biopsy.  It was tolerable though.  I think that's it!  I finally got my first surgery ever out of the way :-)",

Mel,  I'll definitely report back how the surgery went.  It isn't until 3:30 on the 20th (California time).  I just had my pre-op labs done (blood, urine and EKG). I didn't learn too much more from the pre-op.  He said that 5% or less come back showing cancer.  I can choose to have IV sedation if I want but even if it's general, he said they won't stick a tube down my throat.  My brother, an anesthesiologist, confirmed this.  He said he'd make the incision along my arreola even though the area is a good 2 inches above that.  Dissolvable stitches.  I asked if he'd remove about the size of a grape and he said a little bit more than that so if they did find somethink, I'd be less likely to have to have another surgery.  No food 10 hours before, and no drink for 8 hours before.  I'm doing good about not stressing too much.  It's a simple and short surgery.My motto right now is \"just show up\" :-)  I asked him if I could plan on going to dinner and a movie the next day and he said yes, I'll feel totally fine.  I asked about walking on a treadmill and he said to just wait a couple a days.  5 days for weights.  I think I'll wait a little longer than that!  Recovery doesn't sound that much more difficult than the biopsy but I didn't have the hematomas like you did.  That's a bummer. Let me know what your doctors say!",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2009 06:47AM - edited Aug 12, 2009 06:53AM by Juliecc I also have a radial star that I am having excised next Thursday (first surgery).  I had a small cluster of calcifications and from the stereotactic biopsy I had no atypia but the report did say columnar cell alteration and radial scar.  One of the docs called the pathologist and I guess there was part of one in one core - a very small one since it didn't show up on mammogram.  ( I had 12 cores removed, vacuum assisted, 9 gauge needle).  I've read studies that when there is no atypia, there is about a 4% chance of something malignant nearby.  I also read in one study that when 12 or more samples are taken, no malignancies were found.  I read that this might double our future risk of BC whether it's removed or not since our breasts made these radial scars in the first place.  Here were the recommendations of 3 breast doctors: 1. Dr. #1 who did the stereotactic biopsy - \"If it were my wife, I'd tell her to have a follow up mammogram in 6 months.  I've never seen one of these come back positive in my 20 years of doing this.  If it does, I'll buy you a steak dinner (ha ha).  But if you do decide to remove it, that wouldn't be wrong because there's always a first time.  And if it gives you piece of mind . . .\"  This was definitely reassuring to me! 2. Dr. #2 and the pathologist both recommended excision.  The Dr. had called the pathologist since the report was so vague.  Since there was only part of a radial scar in one core, they both recommended excision.  Dr. #2 said better to be safe than sorry and that I had \"very complex\" breast tissue in the area.  Dr. #1 also mentioned I had architectural distortion on the mammogram.  I definitely have very dense, fibrocystic breasts and this increased greatly since my last mammo 2 years ago.  3. Dr. #3, the one who will be doing my surgery, said it's best to remove all radial scars.  I meet with him this morning for a pre-op and I'm trying to come up with my list of questions to ask him about the surgery (wire plus excision).  I'm hoping he'll do IV sedation instead of general anesthesia.  I'll let you know if he says anything interesting this morning.  Did you have any atypia?  I'm going to ask him what percentage of cases like mine come back with cancer. I decided to go for the surgery yesterday and actually feel good about it now.  I think a scar on my chest and a few days of pain are worth not having to wonder if something was missed in there.  The area is about 2 inches above my nipple so I'm going to ask if the scar will be there or if they'll do it along the arreola.",

I feel great today. The excisional with wire was yesterday.  I only notice an ache when I lean forward.  I'm still doing the ice pack thing in my sports bra even though it doesn't hurt.  Just trying to avoid bruising.  I took a Vicoden last night for good measure and a Tylenol this morning but didn't really need it.  I forgot to mention that both the radiologist and the surgeon both had to intitial my right breast with a marker to confirm they were operating on the correct side.  I must have been asked a total of 6 times what procedure was being done and on what side for confirmation.  I thought it was sort of funny.  I'll probably get the results next week. Elizabeth, I hope you get your results today so you don't have to wonder all weekend.  You might just want to call today and ask if they are in!  Sometimes they don't call right away and it sits on their desk. Barbgale, I hope all goes well next Tuesday with your stereotactic!  Mine was a couple of weeks ago and it really wasn't that bad for me.  Only the lidocaine shot hurt for a few seconds and then I felt nothing.  Ice the heck out of your breast afterwards even if it doesn't hurt to avoid a hematoma.  It helps to have 2 ice packs so you'll always have a cold one to switch out with.  It is very soothing.  Update us how everything goes.",

For a few hours after my biopsy, it felt like someone punched me in the upper arm.  That pain went away after about 3 hours.  My breast started to ache 5 hours after and I was icing it alot.  I worked the next day and it was totally fine.  I snuck an ice pack in there every once in awhile because it was soothing.

Mommysta, here's the play by play of my excisional biopsy for you:  By the way I had a headache all day probably due to no caffeine, water, or food.  They did the wire localization in a mammogram room with a rolling chair.  There were 3 people there.  They did all mammogram compressions while I was sitting.  They took a couple of views and then while compressed, gave me a lidocaine shot.  They then inserted the hollow needle and took a couple more mammo views.  I felt tugging when they played with the needle but not pain.  It took them a few minutes to get the needle right where they wanted it.  Then they stuck the wire in and took 2 more views.  They put the needle through the side even though my stereo was through the top.  They taped the wire down with a gauze pad on top and a lady walked me to the elevators and up to the surgery floor.  I was offered a blanket and I took it because it was freezing there!  I had to wait 45 minutes or more in the waiting room until a pre op bed was available. I had my own little room for pre op where I'd spend the next 4 hours!  I had my vitals taken, medical history questions asked, went to the bathroom twice, they did a urine pregnancy test, and then they inserted an IV (no drugs just fluids).  I took about a 2 hour nap which was awesome! Finally 1 and a half hours past my scheduled time, the surgeon came in the see if I had any questions.  Then the anesthesiologist came in and I told him I wanted twighlight sleep.  Everyone was fine with that. Next a nurse put a shot in my IV to relax me (verced I think).  Then I got wheeled to the OR.  I noticed it was big and drab.  There were 3 people across the room fiddling with equipment.  After that, I don't remember a thing!  I don't remember the surgeon walking in or seeing the anesthesiologist.  I don't remember being wheeled to recovery either.  It was fantastic.  I stayed there for 45 minutes and they gave me apple juice.  My sister in law showed up to take me home.  I was fully alert and dressed myself with no problem.  I only have a 4 by 4 inch gauze pad covered by an even bigger square piece of tape,  I can't take a real shower for 48 hours!  We went through a drive through and I devoured a chicken sandwich.  I was starving!  I don't have hardly any pain right now but I think I'll fill my vicoden prescription just in case. The surgeon didn't mark the box about using ice packs but I am anyway!  I hope that's ok.  I didn't even see the surgeon afterward but a nurse said he said it all went well.  No pain yet but I remember my breast starting to ache 5 hours after the stereotactic biopsy.  It was tolerable though.  I think that's it!  I finally got my first surgery ever out of the way :-)",

Good luck and I hope they find nothing more than the ADH. I think I'll get my results next week.  I am going to enjoy my weekend for sure!  I'm even going out with the BF tonight.  I drove the kids to school and everything has been easy.  I have to remember to take it easy even though nothing hurts.  Tomorrow I get to take the gauze off to take a normal shower.  I took a lower half shower this morning :-).  I can't wait to see what the excision looks like underneath.  I'd peak but it's taped down pretty good and I shouldn't mess with it.  My mom lives a couple hours away and I haven't told her I was having the surgery.  I didn't want her to freak out and drive up here.  I'll call her today and tell her I did it and that it was easy.  Should be interesting.  I'll probably be in trouble with her!",

I read a lot about radial scars back then and there were arguments about whether it increased your risk of breast cancer or not. I was diagnosed with BC in 2014 but in my OTHER breast. I don't think the radial scar had anything to do with me getting cancer years later in the other one. Best wishes to you.",

I posted my results in the pleomorphic thread.  I'm also happy to report my results were benign but they did remove a piece of a \"radial scar\" so they will probably excise the area just to be sure nothing was missed.  I'm not as nervous about surgery anymore since I was referred to a woman surgeon I had met with 2 years ago for cysts.  I really disliked the first one.  He was really lousy about explaining anything.  He's the one that failed my first stereotactic. Again, congrats to all of you!",

Feel free to share this post. Breast cancer is a very sneaky disease. I was diagnosed earlier this year with IDC (Invasive Ductal Carcinoma) and had a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction. Unfortunately, I will always live with the fear of metastasis. During my last reconstruction surgery in August, I had 2 areas biopsied and they were ok. Now I have several new hard bumps we are watching that are probably just scar tissue or dissolvable sutures. I am checked every 3 months and will be on Tamoxifen for 10 years. \"Approximately 5% to 10% of breast cancers are metastatic at diagnosis; of these, approximately one-fifth will survive 5 years. Depending on prognostic factors, up to 30% of node-negative and up to 70% of node-positive breast cancers will relapse.\" Yes even stage one, node negative breast cancer can recur as stage 4. There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer. So breast cancer is always on my mind, every hour of the day it pops up in my head. Hopefully that will get better as time passes. I really appreciate all the love and support from my friends and family this year! You have all been amazing. Remember 1 in 8 of us will be diagnosed in our lifetimes so please check yourselves often. The earlier you are diagnosed, the better your prognosis. We are now in breast cancer awareness month and we will be seeing pink ribbons everywhere, from our bucket of KFC chicken, to our box of cereal. Here is a post I'd like to share from a fellow breast cancer survivor: As many of you begin to participate in the Annual \u201cBreast Cancer Awareness\u201d activities coming up, I just ask you to please consider these things: 1. Does the activity TRIVIALIZE breast cancer? NOT GOOD! This is a very serious issue. 2. Does the activity SEXUALIZE breast cancer? NOT GOOD! There is nothing sexy about breast cancer. 3. Does the activity generate income to be donated to a reputable organization that provides direct services to women in need? GREAT! Low income patients need all the help they can get. 4. Does the activity generate income to be donated to a reputable organization that funds research for a breast cancer CURE? GREAT! We all have \u201cawareness\u201d\u2026 what we need is a CURE. 5. If you put a \u201cPinkwashed\u201d product in your shopping cart, have you checked to see exactly how much money from that sale is donated, and the name of the organization where the proceeds are donated? GREAT! If it is not stated, then the MANUFACTURER is making money off the misery of breast cancer patients everywhere. NOT GOOD! Pink ribbon advertising is not enough.",
