I do not have lymphodema - but like many of you are at risk due to node surgery (I am node positive).  My axillary dissection surgery went well and the scar has healed nicely.  I am travelling From FL (sea level) to Keystone, CO (base at 9600) next month.  I have been advised by my onc. to get a compression sleeve 20-30 to wear during the flight.  Thankfully I will be able to fly first class so space at least will not be an issue and I can stretch my arm and move it/exercise it during the flight.  I will stay hydrated and do not drink any alcohol ever. I am age 49, 5'7\" 108 lbs (underweight and trying to gain) and prior to bc I was very active and athletic, not to mention 11 lbs heavier.  My questions: (1) I do NOT plan to ski, but the elevation of my home there is 9600.  Should I wear the sleeve during the days while in Keystone since I will be at such a high elevation? (2) I went to be fitted today and the licensed therepist indicated that I DO NOT need a guantlet or glove;  however I have read that you should always wear one.  The script from my onc. did NOT include a glove.  The sleeve I am getting is a JOBST - the newer fabric with wider band at the wrist.  Should I insist on a glove?
