Can't make Wednesday get here soon enough. Thanks for answering my questions. Have a great weekend to all. Blessings.",

I went to the doctor for my regular checkup and also had some discomfort (bruised feeling) along my bra line.  I figured it was my rib from a poor fitting bra or something?  She sent me in for a Mammy & Ultrasound & xray of the ribcage.  They did the Mammy & then called me back for 5 additional pictures to try and get closer to the chest wall (very uncomfortable)  they used different sorts of trays (if that makes sense to anyone).  There was a spot that needed to be looked at closer apparently.   Also when the tech was taking the pictures, she kept putting an arrow towards the breast wall on the bottom....  Next I went to the ultrasound room where they did all of 45 seconds (not exaggerating) and only looked at the base of my breast (nowhere else?)  I am assuming this is good news?  The us tech didn't seemed concerned, however no one gave me definative answers.  In previous Mammy/Ultrasounds, They have always said everything looks good.  Now of course, I'm worried.  I can't feel a lump or anything.  AND I've heard in most cases breast cancer is Not painful. Now I have to wait and see I suppose.  I'm not sure why I decided to post other than I am very antsy, and would love to hear other stories that might be similar (or not) to mine.
