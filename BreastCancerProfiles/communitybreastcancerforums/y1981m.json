Unfortunately, he can't see me until July 7. I'm trying my best not to worry and continue with life as normally as possible the next few weeks. Things will be fine until I get an itch or pain in my breast and then I feel the panic wash over me. Any ideas on what to expect at my appointment? I truly appreciate all the wisdom that has been shared with me on this board. Thank you!",

      "Content": "y1981m wrote: Nearly 3 weeks ago I found a lump in my left breast. The next night I had intense burning/itching near my areola on the same breast. Three days later my gynecologist conducted a clinical breast exam. She was certain it was a cyst but ordered a diagnostic bilateral mammogram and ultrasound.Last week I went in for the tests, they also did digital tomosynthesis which I believe is a 3D mammogram. I was beyond relieved when the radiologist came in and told me that based on both exams he was confident I had a single 2cm cyst. My gynecologist called me later that day to confirm the radiologist's interpretation. The cyst is still there. I have symptoms in my left breast ranging from itching, a sunburned feeling, pain, fullness and a feeling similar to let down when I was breastfeeding may years ago. These sensations come and go. I'm 33 years old, two children, no family history. What should I do? I'm concerned this is more than \"just a cyst\". Should I get it aspirated? Am I making something out of nothing? Thank you!

My gut feeling often gets hijacked by my anxiety so I struggle with discerning what is actual cause for concern sometimes. I posted my question on the John Hopkins \"Ask an Expert\" board as well and the response was that my symptoms are most likely caused by the cyst and/or hormonal shift. That being said, I will be contacting my doctor on Monday to request an aspiration. From what I have read the appearance of the fluid would let the doctor know if a biopsy was needed, correct? ",
