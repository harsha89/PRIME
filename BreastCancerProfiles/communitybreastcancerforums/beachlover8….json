I seemed at ease until several friends mentioned to me that I should seek a second opinion and that how could they make determination without ultrasound and/or biopsy being done.  Should I seek second opinion or just wait for the twelve months and follow up with my yearly mammogram?  Very confused right now -- have heard horror stories of this being precursor to breast cancer -- not to mention everything I googled online mentioned biopsy.",
