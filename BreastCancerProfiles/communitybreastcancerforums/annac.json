I had 10 treatments and went to the ER with severe chest discomfort (shortness of breath, real discomfort breathing or moving, especially lying flat was terrible -thought I was having a stroke or heart attack), and got a diagnosed of Radiation Induced Pleurisy -inflammation of the lining of the lungs.  HOWEVER, the radiation doctors/nurses/therapists I talked to afterwards said that couldn't be so, doesn't happen until a month after treatment ends if at all, and nothing in my heart, blood or CT scans showed any indication of pleurisy.  All the same, even with steroids prescribed in the ER, days later still feel wheezy and lightheaded with sensitivity in the chest area.  Goes nicely with the hot flashes/rapid heartbeat caused by chemo!   Would like to know if anyone else has had this.

Can I ask at what point you developed these symptoms - during your radiation or how long after? Also, was it your regular MD who referred you to a pulmonologist and why? The radiation oncologists I spoke to did say inflammation of the lung linings (pleuritis) could happen due to breast radiation, and if so happens a month after treatment ends, so that could be what you have.  If so, steroids do seem to be the treatment and apparently it goes away after some time.  Like you I'm concerned about what this might be doing to my heart.  ",
