I've been going to a physical therapist and suddenly, one morning I noticed a hard lump in the center of my elbow about a cm above the crease. I thought it was part of the cord and showed it to the PT. She said it wasn't part of the cord but didn't seem worried and said it could be a swollen lymph vessel. It's still there weeks later and I am starting to FREAK OUT. Afraid it's a tumor/recurrence in a lymph node. I'm going in next week when I get back on vacation and the nurse said we could always biopsy it. Great. Which made me freak out even more. Has anyone had a hard, pebble like lump due to cording? And does anyone know if we even have lymph nodes in the center of elbow crease? Everything I see says lymph nodes are on the medial/inner side of the elbow. Thanks. Trying to breathe.

Leggy and farmer lucky: my husband felt it and thinks it's a cyst so that's what I'm hoping for! It is really tiny, like size of a grain of rice. I am really crossing my fingers that I'm just crazy.",
