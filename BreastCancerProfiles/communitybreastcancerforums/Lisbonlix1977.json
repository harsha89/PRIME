    "Content": "Lisbonlix1977 wrote: hello, I juts turned 40 in January and what was a regular annual physical turned out to be a huge health scare. I have extreme dense breast, and have had fibroadenomas removed from both breasts in the past. But this mammogram came is as Bi Rad 4 with one 9 milimeter anterior depth with suspition of malignancy on left breast and a 1cm middle depth mass indetermined. They requested the prior films (had them done at a different hospital) for comparison, but biopsy was recommended with a note stating prior films needed prior to biopsy being scheduled. I do have calcification in both breasts, but they do not elaborate further. I have always had extreme cystic breast, with 2 lumpectomies (fibroadenomas) and 1 aspiration. But I don't think I ever had (or read) a mammo report that said suspition of malignancy. On top of it all, I had a 4cm polyp removed today at only age 40. The proctologist surgeon said it was huge and that if I got a colonoscopy at only age 50 ( when recommended) I would have cancer. She seemed pretty positive that it is not cancer now but nonetheless, I won't know until pathology comes. I am trying to stay positive and not freak out, but I keep playing all these worst case scenarios in my head... and with a double whammy to test my sanity. Log in to post a reply",
