The fear to know you have cancer is truly horrible. Then You go into surgery and in my case get a double mastectomy with reconstruction. You wake up in pain and then the journey beggings of pain and being so uncomfortable and like you lost your body. The doctor told me that I would lost all sensation on your breasts and the reality of mentally accepting it. Is truly a different and difficult thing that no one really talk to you about. Yes, there are support groups. But, what happens in the middle of the night? When your in pain and you feel you have lost control of your body completely. Your breast and cheats feel so uncomfortable and not YOU! You find yourself crying because just a few months ago i was normal and here I am with this situation that came out of nowhere. How do you deal with it? Your heart and life feel so sad. I am truly broke... my heart and my spirit feel broken and so sady at times. I know am not the only one. I known sadly that somewhere in the world there may be another woman feeling the same thing I am! Is just not fair we have to have cancer and go through all that is expected of us!

I was really mess up the night before crying because I didn't want more pain. The first surgery was extremely painful. That stayed with me. But, am so glad and happy to say that I am not in pain. I am uncountable but I can deal with that. I am taking pain medication but I believe I can stop taking them by tomorrow. I want to give myself time to make sure I don't need them and start Tylenol only. I don't want to make an error and get pain. But, there is a light and am seeing it! Via Log in to post a reply",

But, you ladies understand me. When they told us we had Cancer a tsunami came into our life and truly destroyed our life. We as strong women that we are have dealt with the surgery, treatment, side effects of whatever treatments we need. Now that the tsunami has pass we are left with a mess to clean. I personally feel my mental health have gone through a very hard journey and somehow it is time to deal with it! Make myself feel safe again. I am cancer free now and now I have to move on with mylife. But, it can't never be the same. I have change in this months. I have also learned that things do happen to anyone including myself and there is this vulnerably in me. I don't know if many of you understand what am trying to say. But, this group has help me so much just when I think am walking alone many of you write letting me know you are in the same path as I am. I thank you all for that! Via Log in to post a reply",
