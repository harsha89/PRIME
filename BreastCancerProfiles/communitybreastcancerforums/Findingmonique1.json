I recently found a lump in my breast after having an ultrasound the radiologist told me she thinks it might be a fibroadenoma but is worried because the margins are irregular (almost looks split??) and the size is bigger than 2cm (it is 2.5) she is sending me to a breast surgeon to have it removed, I guess my question is even though it is 2.5 cm and doesn't have clean margins has anyone else ever still had the tumor come back benign? I am only 20 years old and had a baby about a year ago. I am so scared. The doctors weren't very nice and seemed to not want to answer my questions I had left feeling as if I for sure have cancer.
