My doctor was thinking it may just be Mastitis so he ordered Dicloxacillin. I've been on 2000mg a day and today is day 4 of 7. The left breast they were checking on still feels full and tender like it has been. The lump under my left armpit went away before I started the meds along with the lump in my left breast. I'm 33 in December and I still am only 85% \"feel good\" about my results. I've already schedule a followup with my doctor after my Dicloxacillin course as a just in case. I haven't breastfed in 9 years and I haven't injured my breast AND my U/S is clear....what's wrong with me? Log in to post a reply",
