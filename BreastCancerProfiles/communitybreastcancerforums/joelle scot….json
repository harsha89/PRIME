You may have a hard time as a family yet but there is definitely light at the end of the tunnel. Be strong for your mum and stop all the people who think it is the end of the road to address her directly as IT IS NOT. I have been diagnosed with stage 3 in april 2008, had a radical mastectomy on my left breast on 30 may 2008 with immediate reconstruction from abdominal tissue (free flap with no  muscle transfer, only a small strip for blood supply). Clear margin around the tumour and only 1 node diseased out of 23 removed. On that base and because nobody was in a hurry to give me invasive treatment, I declined chemo and radiotherapy and started on tamoxifen on 22nd of July. on 11th of august after a bone scan that showed nothing, a CT scan and an MRI I was confirmed stage 4 with bones metastases, so added Ibandronic acid (Ibandronate) to my hormone treatment to support my bones. It went ok for a while but wasnt enough. Had a second op on my right breast to size match the reconstructed one and started in february 2009 a new hormone treatment Arimidex in conjunction with Zoladex to stop my ovaries producting oestrogen. It seems to work better as the tumour markers are decreasing. I'll see my oncologist next wednesday for confirmation of detail. Do ask all the question you want to understand all the options for treatment. Chemo is not the answer to all cases, it wouldnt work for me, only as a palliative.  I am really doing well. I try to eat as healthy as possible (lots of fruit and veg) little animal products due to hormone receptive cancer cells, and also take all the immune system reinforcement I can think of like vit.C with zink for healing, omega 3 to help the growth of healthy cells and glucosamine chondroitine to help the joints affected by treatment side effects. I have now started to drink green tea as an anti oxidant, flaxseed and flaxseed oil. I did all the excercises the physio told me to at the hospital on my 1st op and have recovered full use of my arm. I remember the nurses laughing in a nice way when they could see both my legs and arms moving as soon as I could after the op although still bed bound. \"you must feel the pull but not the pain\" said the physio, I applied it all the time and as often as I could. They all said I needed 6 weeks of rest after the op, after 2 weeks my husband couldn't stop me getting up and wanting to go for a walk. Started with 10 min and worked it up, now I make sure I get at least 30 min to an hour of excercise every day. Walking is my best but I also like swimming and cycling ( the two latters I still have to improve, gently does it, it will come) I have 3 boys (15, 12 and 8 years old). I just had my 50th birthday and intend to have plenty more of them. I also go to our local \"healing rooms\", they are wonderful people and did so much for my positive thinking, helped relieve stress and anxiety. I know they do exist in the US, ask around or let me know if you dont find any and I'll get a US site for you, may be in your area. They are a christian organization but you dont have to be from any particular faith or at all, they are just willing to help. I cried bucket of water the 1st time but since I dont have tension in  my back and hardly any pain. I am a believer though. I am also in our church choir which has been a great support to me. Singing forces you to breath deeply which help the upper body to function due to oxygen intake and  get the upper body lymph working faster, same when you walk. I will be thinking of you and your mum on 19th with all my heart for a strong recovery. Just let her take her pace when she is back home and encourage her to be positive all the time, make every little achievement a great step toward recovery. You might need to find yourself somebody you can talk to, a family member or a friend to help you keep strong as well. Obviously any one online will be more than happy to contribute. Much love and blessing to you, your mum, your family and your medical team (I had a great one over here in Scotland). Joelle",

      "Content": "Jun 12, 2009 07:58AM - edited Jun 12, 2009 08:01AM by joelle-scotland Hi Nicole, have been away from the forum for a bit trying to help thru a couple of friends dealing with different form of cancer.Your mum still has her greatest asset at her side and its YOU! Take turn with other member of the family to be by your mum side and have a breath of fresh air doing whatever you want to do.That way you can bring your mum a good story back with plenty positive thoughts. Strangely enough, I didn't mind loosing a boob, its was all the treatment afterwards I was more scared off because of the side effects. Chemo can have its toll on some women but you can beat it. Get some gentle excercise in fresh air is a good way to feel better with yourself and also help coping with side effect. The other excercise your mum can do, if the main room is not above the main street but a garden is breathing excercise. Gently first and work it up. Oxygen is very important to move around the blood and increase activities in the body healthy cells. It also help treatment to go faster round the body. Since I last wrote I have got another great improvement in myself which my GP said is fantastic and due to all the walking and breathing excercise I am doing. It is the ability to feel my chest lifting properly when deep breathing. I had felt my upper body was stuck to my abdomen since my op last year and complained about pressure around my upper body, likely caused by the cancer in the thorax part of the bones. I AM FREE were my words, when I first discovered I could lift my chest freely when breathing and no pain in the chest, back or abdomen. I didn't say anything at first worried it might not last but it is now over three weeks and I am convinced the bone disease has reduced and the pressure around my thorax has been removed. My swimming has gone better too. Sickness, fatigue, headaches are more than likely a side effect ot the chemo for your mum. I was told that a very healthy diet with little animal product, plenty fresh fruits and veg can help. I had joints pain with the hormone treatment, I couldn't push down door handles in my own house and had to push down with my whole body, so much my hands were sore. Coincidence or getting used to the treatment, since I seriously started my healthy diet, the pain has now gone and I have to remind myself not to lift anything too heavy. I get lots of diet infos from american web sites. Animal products are inflamatory to the system thus can increase any type of pains. Decrease all animal products and choose organic was the answer and it seems to work for me! Again, make a big fuss of every little achievement and success your mum gets every day and all those positive steps will help her and you through it. Body, Mind and Soul. TLC for all 3 added with plenty love.  Much love, prayers and positive thoughts going toward you Take care",
