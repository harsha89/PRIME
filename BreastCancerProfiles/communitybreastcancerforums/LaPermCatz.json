I was really ill after 1 dose and then had low platelets and the Gem part was delayed a week. I think my body was in shock from the drugs.My Carbo was dropped, and I have had no blood problems since then, and on Cycle 10. The combo reduced my lung tumours and kept it stable since then. I hope you get your treatment soon... Best Wishes Lizzi",
