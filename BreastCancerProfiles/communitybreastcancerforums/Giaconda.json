Initially as it seems to be hormonal related she just sent me away and I went back after my daughter was born as it felt larger and more painful and had an ultrasound and needle biopsy which just came back OK. I then went on the genetic screening programme as I have a family history of BC and have had annual mammograms and MRI scans for the last 4 years and nothing was picked up until my last MRI a few weeks ago. Finally the consultant decided to investigate what she described as a large abnormal area and I had 4 core biopsies taken last week and PASH was diagnosed. I had a Titanium chip put in to mark the area and now have to return for another mammogram and MRI scan to mark where the chip is and make sure they took biopsies of the correct area. I feel rather nervous reading about PASH that mine has been left for so long especially with a family history of BC and that it could mask cancer as I have very dense breast tissue which they always remark on when I have a mammogram. I feel that I should have it removed and it might be a lumpectomy because the size feels large - 5cms plus. they say that PASH isn't painful in most cases but mine always has been very sore - it wakes me up at night when I lie on my right side and I feel a tight, drawing sensation up into my armpit and down my right arm to the elbow. I'm 42 with small children and little help with childcare so surgery is going to be difficult but better that than risk the alternative so I guess I will be asking for more information. Glad to find other women with PASH as had never heard of it til last Friday! Good luck to you all.",
