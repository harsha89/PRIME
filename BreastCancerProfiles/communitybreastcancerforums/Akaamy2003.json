      "Content": "Sep 18, 2018 11:13PM - edited Sep 18, 2018 11:21PM by Akaamy2003 Hello all, I am in the home stretch of PALLAS (cycle 21 of 24) and in the drug arm so I wanted to chime in here. As we all know, it can be hard to figure out what is causing side effects when we are taking so many different things. I have joint pain, particularly when I first get up in the morning or if I've been sitting a while. My hair is thinning, and I have some neuropathy and edema in my ankles. For me the worst side effect by far is the \"hand and foot syndrome\" (similar to what KammyMN mentioned above). The skin on my thumbs, index fingers, as well as my heels, big toes and the balls of my feet is \"hyperkeratotic\" which means it is thick and hard. It cracks and peels, and is driving me crazy. The treatment is to apply an assortment of creams and wear gloves and socks to bed, which seem to do nothing. Walking is painful when the skin on the soles of your feet is breaking down! I can stick it out for the remainder of the trial, and hoping that eventually my skin will recover. I don't want to discourage anyone from doing PALLAS -- I'm told this particular side effect is rare. But since others have mentioned it I'm now curious about how rare it really is.",

The reason it didn't show up on my MRI on 6/28 is that this type of lesion does not enhance on MRI, apparently. The doctor who swore it was not present on my ultrasound last December was apparently mistaken, according to my breast surgeon. At any rate, I'm relieved to now have the chance to have my remaining breast removed without having to take lymph nodes. It will be outpatient surgery and will take about an hour. Already scheduled for November.",

I don't have noticeable side effects even though my counts are consistently on the low side. Things are going well so I'm planning to finish all 24 months. One thing to keep in mind is that the drug is free but the doctor visits, blood draws, and labs are not covered by Pfizer. You have to pay for those. In principle I don't like footing the bill for medical research but I decided that I would rather stay in the trial than to drop out to save a few thousand dollars.",

I wanted minimal surgery, minimal drains, fastest possible recovery. So I did UMX without reconstruction, no chemo. My plan was to recover from the UMX, finish the PALLAS trial and then go back and have the other breast off once I was totally healed and in my right mind. But last week, I had a BI-RAD 4 ultrasound of a new suspicious mass in my remaining breast, only 10 weeks after a normal (BI-RAD 1) MRI. This lump did not exist in July, and in September is already 1.6 cm! I had my ovaries removed last year and am on anastrazole so this is no fibroadenoma or ER+ tumor. Am awaiting biopsy results now... I already have an appointment with my surgeon to take this breast off no matter what the results are.",
