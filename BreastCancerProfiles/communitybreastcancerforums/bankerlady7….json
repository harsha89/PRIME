I initially went in to see my doctor for a yearly clinical exam in 2013 at the age of 37. I had some nipple discharge for the last 16 years prior after the birth of my first daughter. I had it checked out several times prior and every doctor had looked at it, put it under a microscope and told me not to worry about it. My doctor wanted me to have it checked out again & sent me to the hospital for an ultrasound. Nothing was found on the ultrasound and I was sent in the next room for a mammogram. While doing the mammo they found clustered calcifications which led to a needle biopsy and then a surgical biopsy. ADH was found and all the cells were taken out with the surgery leaving me with clear margins. I decided to forgo the Tamoxifen knowing it would throw me into early menopause. Here I am now, I just had another suspicious mammo and then a follow up with more images. They said nothing was really found of importance but my doctor is having me have an MRI, speak with a genetic counselor and start going to a specialist. My mom had breast cancer is 2012 at the age of 72. I am just worried that this will turn into a lifetime of testing and repeat biopsies.",
