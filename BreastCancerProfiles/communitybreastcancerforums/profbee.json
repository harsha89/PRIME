My plastic surgeon was moving from one hospital to another.  I had trouble getting an appt for my surgery.  So finally, I called  my breast surgeon (who did the first half of my mastectomy) and said I need a referral for another surgeon since I can't get an appt with my plastic surgeon.  They set me up with someone else...and then lo and behold my plastic surgeon called me himself an hour later and set aside a surgery date for me.  :)  If you're not happy with this guy, I would totally get a recommendation for someone else. They don't need to hear all about WHY you want someone else (docs do tend to protect each other)...I would just say I'd just rather have another surgeon.   Oh, and I think cleavage is like really hard to get with the implants, but maybe I'm wrong.  I don't know...these TEs are pretty darn big on me, but I've always had a space between my boobs.  I can't imagine how big they'd have to be to get cleavage!  Scary!! Good luck.  i'm sorry this has been so tough. ",

That's so nice of you to say.  And I totally hear you--at the beginning it's one foot in front of the other, but then looking ahead feels like a LONG road.  I just started my Tamoxifen yesterday and the thought of taking it for FIVE years...crazy.  I had nutso thoughts about how then Jack will be ten..and even that (although it feels like such a long time) is still too young to lose your mom.  Nuts, I KNOW.  I know that I have a great prognosis, but those awful thoughts sometimes creep in.   Dogeyed, I've totally considered a BC tattoo--and I've never wanted a tattoo.  It just feels funny that my only tattoo will be of something I didn't choose that should be there in the first place, nipples!  ugh.  I've thought of some little boxing gloves (hubby got me a charm of little boxing gloves for my charm bracelet as I finished chemo).  We'll see.  You may want to just go to one of those places that specializes in undergarments after mastectomies.  I hear they can be really awesome.  Someone on the boards said they are just going to go there and hang out b/c the ladies had all been through it themselves and were totally upbeat, supportive, and knowledgeable.   Sara, I think I'm filled to 540.  I went to Vicky's Secret and she said I was between a B and a C.  This is just with the TEs.  I felt kind of weird about them..they're just so hard and don't move at all...so I went and got one pretty bra to make me feel better.  I wore it like twice.  :)  Exchange surgery is Dec 19th for me!  I'll be able to send you pics and everything before you do yours!   Love to all!  So jealous that lots of people are putting up their trees tonight, but I think if we cut one down now it wouldn't make it to Christmas! ",

Best of luck.  Take your time to make this decision.  It's a toughie.   ",

Ask what the results are for ER and PR (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor--it will indicate which chemo meds will work for you) Ask if you are HER2 positive (this is a protein that also changes your treatment plan--this test takes a few days, so often you don't hear this at the initial diagnosis)  These next things can change as they go, for instance they can think it's 2 cm and get in there and it's really just 1. How large is the lump?  Are there any signs of invasion?   You could ask what stage she thinks you'd be (again, this can change and he may not be able to answer, but you may want to know what she thinks) Ask her what she thinks the next steps should be (surgery, chemo, radiation, etc.)--but I would recommend getting a second opinion before you go ahead with anything anyway.   Ask her what you should do now.  (Call a breast surgeon?)  Specifically, is there more testing that we should do now to get a complete picture (MRI? Another biopsy?)? I'm sure others will chime in, and I'd bet there's a list over on BC.org somewhere.  :)   ",
