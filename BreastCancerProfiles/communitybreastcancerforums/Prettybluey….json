I think I'm most frustrated that I found the lumps in my breast back in February while pregnant and my OB did an exam and told me it wasn't cancer and that breast cancer isn't painful! Grrrr. How old are your children? I have DS 14, he'll be 15 on the 25th DD 13, DS 7 & DS 10 weeks. Hugs to you and your family. How did you tell your kids? I'm not sure if I should bring them to my Oncologist appointment when he tells me my actual diagnosis. Thoughts?  ",

Because back in February when I had my 1st mammagram and ultrasound they only saw dense breast mass. So in 6 months I'm here now. Thank you for sharing about the liver lesions. I'll try to remain calm and not eat everything in site until I get confirmation haha!!! 😁😝",

Is it in my lymph nodes up along my collarbone and along my neck?That's where I have soo much pain radiating. It makes it hard to sleep. I guess it's pointless in calling my surgeon until the PET scan report posts, right?! ~Joseanna",

My arms were aching pretty bad afterwards but for being claustrophobic, I was quit calm. I just kept my eyes closed the whole time and took big deep breaths😁😎👍💪 Yesterday was TORCHER I tell ya! I was checking my online file ALL day and finally around 8 it popped up! I jumped off the couch n read it out loud to DH. Most of it I just don't get. Why can't they tell what it is after ALL these scans?! My heart dropped when I read about the liver lesions. I'm not really a heavy or regular drinker for that matter or smoker or any kind of drug user. Soo now I'm obsessed with trying to find anyone with a similar reading/ diagnosis. I'm happy to hear you made it through yours too 😊 fingers crossed for good results for you. I feel it's going to be a long weekend for us. Hugs n positive healing thoughts. ~ Joseann",

My friend is a nurse and she is going to come over Monday to help me read them which is great because I have my MRI tomorrow and I'm hoping the results will be posted! Then I go the 13th for PET/CT and the 17th, my 42nd Birthday, for my biopsy and the 18th I get to meet the Oncologist and get my results! Eeek!!! I'm so happy that you get to keep your breast. I too can handle losing my hair! My 15 year old wants me to get a Mohawk and dye it before I lose it! Ha! Ha!! Hugs to you ~ Joseanna",

I've tried to stay away from the boards because I've just been obsessing over every cough and ach n pain I'm feeling!😝😁 But alas I've missed you all and I'm back!  I was supposed to have my PET/CT last week and had been eating my low carb diet and resting and drinking my water for 2 days and then the night before I get a call and the darn Technicians were BOTH out sick! Ohhh I was so frustrated! But my Dr. Got on it and got me rescheduled for this Thursday! I did have my MRI Saturday. They only let females do the breast so she only comes in on Saturdays. It went surprisingly smooth! I didn't get sick, although laying on my stomach was a bit uncomfortable and I had to take some deep breathes, I made it!!! Yippee 😁😎 So now I have my PET scan Thursday, biopsy Monday and Oncologist Tuesday with my results/diagnosis. My hubby is taking my step son to scout camp from Thurday-Sunday and his parents are coming out this weekend to be there for us during my Birthday, Monday, and my diagnosis. So I'll be super busy cleaning house and maybe doing some yard work. Ohh we went shopping g and I've started collecting HATS! Dr said he's pretty sure I'll be doing chemo so I'm getting a head start on my newest accessory!! Ha! Ha!! Hugs, strength and positive thought to you all. ~ Joseanna ",

I'm not sure even what it will say or if I'll even understand if it's bad news or not. I'm sorry you have to go back in for another scan. Sounds a little scary.

So far my Ultrasound, mammagram and MRI are showing a 4.7 cm large mass on my right breast. I also have suspicious nodes in my axillary and a swollen node on my collarbone and 2 very large swollen nodes on my neck that shoot pain up the back of my skull. My right shoulder has been numb now for a couple of months. My MRI showed lesions on my liver and so I'm over here freaking out about Mets too. I had my PET scan yesterday and biopsy Monday, my 42nd Birthday. Then we meet the oncologist the 18th for my diagnosis. It's going to be a VERY long weekend. Ohhh and I too have kids!
