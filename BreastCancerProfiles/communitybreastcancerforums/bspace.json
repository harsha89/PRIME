Let me first say that I'm planning on going to another doctor, and I already saw one at my university but I think she got it all wrong. Whew, okay. By the way, I'm 20 so I understand my risk is lower, but I'd rather be safe than sorry because it does happen to young folks sometimes. So I've been having this issue where my right nipple has a little part where it bleeds sometimes or has pus come out, and usually it takes a little effort on my part to get the blood or pus to come out, but sometimes I notice that my bras have very tiny spots of blood on them. If I'm remembering correctly, sometimes the blood or pus is already starting to come out but it's not a lot but it's already on the surface of the nipple. This issue popped up in September, and I thought maybe a lover was too rough on me, and eventually it would heal up if I didn't mess with it, but the issue still persisted. I also thought that maybe it was because I have nipple piercings, but I've had the piercings for 2 years, the thing is healed, and the area around it seems fine minus a few crusties here and there. Sometimes my nipple looks crusty and maybe that's because of the pus, but it looks almost like it's dry skin. So I'm kind of at a loss. I decided to finally go to a nurse practitioner at my university, and she checked out my breasts and told me that I had a cyst on each one and it's probably because of my period (I'm currently on my period), but I never even felt the cysts before. She says it's normal so I didn't really worry about that. She told me to get my blood tested the next day for my prolactin levels I guess because she thought I was lactating even though I've never had kids, and I'm not pregnant. I asked her if she thought it was anything serious and she said no, but she was getting me tested because the issue is confined to one breast so she wanted to check it out just in case. My prolactin levels are fine apparently, and I think she said to come back in a month or a week after my period ends (I can't remember exactly, sorry!). I think I need a second opinion from a real obgyn. I already have anxiety problems so this just really makes me more anxious and I'm convinced that this is a serious problem even though maybe I'm being a hypochondriac. When I looked up Paget's (yes, I know I shouldn't look up stuff online that'll make me even more worried but... I did), I have the symptoms of the bloody/pus discharge, and the dry skin. I looked up pictures online of early Paget's and it looks kind of like my nipple. My roommate's mom (who is a nurse) says maybe a cyst burst which could be the issue but I'm just not sure. Plus, if I have cysts, I haven't felt any pain.... Any advice? Am I worrying too much? Thanks for any and all help, and for taking the time to read this! Log in to post a reply",
