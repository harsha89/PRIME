Went to the gynecologist who says he couldn't feel anything though he says maybe there was a Fullness under my arm. He said let's get ultrasound to make sure. They did find an enlarged lymph node under that armpit..and when she was using the rollerball for the ultrasound it was sore like a pinching. I am getting it biopsied next week. Still confused ..always heard cancer doesn't cause soreness? They said they have to rule out lymphoma also because my mother is asymptomatic but has had B cell lymphoma for two years. They did assure me it could be a reactive node but they need to make sure and rule everything else out. They said I would get results within two or three days and I am getting a biopsy on December 4 .. they are doing a core biopsy as a needle biopsy they say doesn't get everything they need for diagnosis. Any comments are welcome thank U thank U God is good ",

My right under arm was so sore when I felt it there is a soft what feels like an enlarged lymph node? I am on hormone patches for my hot flashes so Gyno always says to tell him any symptoms. My primary says it could be from my upper respiratory to give it some time. Just so uncomfortable feeling a lump so I still called my Gyno who says stay on the antibiotic and if it's not gone in a a week to come in. Just wondering if anybody had a lymph node soft lump and soreness under their arms which led to BC? ( Plus it's further away not close to the chest wall ) I always thought the auxiliary under arm lymph nodes were not associated with respiratory sicknesses? Praying and being positive.
