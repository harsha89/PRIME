Now I am going to prepare for my surgery which I chose to have a mastectomy because my breast is small plus I want to remove it as clean as possible. Now my main concern is lymph nodes and how many should I have them removed. I visited 3 surgeons and all of them told me the standard way after neoadjuvant chemo is: check 3 nodes, most likely sentinel nodes during the surgery. If all of them are negative, then no more nodes will be removed. If any of them is still positive, then axillary dissection will be performed which will remove all level 1 and level 2 nodes. But for me, I know I had one, and a fairly big one before chemo. If now they pick 3 and all of them are negative, they will remove no more. Will that put me on a big risk of local recurrence? Of course I want to do everything I can to minimize the chance of recurrence and I don't want one day, If I have local recurrence, I would regret I did not do enough this time. So if I choose to do axillary dissection no matter what, will that be a good, or wise decision? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

That is what the Dr told me too, \"But I was told that nowadays they do not go back in and take out the rest of the lymph nodes, they just radiate them, and it works as well or better, and less chance of triggering lymphedema.\". It is just my mind, or my heart has a very hard time to believe it which I don't know if it is right or wrong.., :(",

Has anyone done such test before? And better get one done before surgery? Originally I learned the test from here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ie8Fl...

      "Content": "MoonBlue wrote: Hi, all, I have one lymph node positive and I am doing chemo before surgery. Most likely I am going to have mastectomy with axillary dissection. My question is, how can the surgeon know which lymph node to keep, which one to remove, especially I do chemo first so they will not be able to see any active cancer cells during the surgery. Another thing is, even they can tell, can they tell right away or they have to send the samples to lab? If they need to send samples to lab, then how can they make sure they can clear all necessary nodes during the same surgery? I don't want to do surgery over and over again until the lab results finally show as \"cleared\". Thanks Log in to post a reply",

I know the big impact of removing level 1 & 2 nodes, that is why I feel so difficult to make the call. I will try the other board and see if someone has similar experiences. Thanks.",
