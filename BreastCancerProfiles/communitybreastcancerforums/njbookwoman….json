Here is the link to the page to view Dana's Patient Introduction at the MBCN conference last year that some have mentioned. (Her video is toward the bottom of this webpage): http://mbcn.org/special-events/category/video-presentations/P6/  If you didn't know her, I think you will feel like you did after viewing this. Peace to Dana and her family and friends.",
