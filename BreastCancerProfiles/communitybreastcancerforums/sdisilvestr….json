Like so many of the others have already told you, do not lose hope!  You will definitely find your new normal and your kids will be a big part of keeping you grounded.  Life goes on, different, but not always bad.  In fact, there are many blessings that this all has brought me.  I have liver and bone mets, and all are currently very well controlled.  My first prognosis was 18 months \"tops\" and now I am hearing much better (decades, perhaps).  Treatment works, there are many options, and you can do this! Best of luck! Suzanne",

Nonetheless, my recent PET shows that previously intense metabolic activity is now gone from that particular met so I can't say I regret the procedure.  It (along with a rib that also received radiation, albeit the traditional kind) was my only active met and since both are now resolved and all is quiet, I am very pleased with the results. I am now considering that the pain was never related to the cancer (none of my other innumerable bone mets ever caused me any pain) and perhaps I have a slipped disc or something of the sort. PM me if you have any other questions. The procedure itself was painless and quick, but I was REALLY tired and weak for a few days following.  And now I have some strange numbness lateral to the area in my ribs but have no idea if that is related or not. ",

We are staying with good friends, the older boys are doing football camp while I take the smaller ones to the beach or the park and actually listen to what they are saying to me for a change. I have unexplainably had very little appetite since March and lost about 15 pounds. Since I have been here, however, my appetite has come back completely and I have gained at least 5 of them back cooking and eating with my friend and getting treats with the kids. Makes me wonder if it isn't related to the day to day stress of dealing with this illness and nothing more. It is not healthy for us to think about cancer constantly, yet that is certainly what I do. This vacation has been the farthest I have been from cancer clinically, emotionally and physically since I got on this roller coaster. So, yes, ladies, go on vacation. It is a much needed break from it all! When I get home next week I have an excisional biopsy, a brain scan and my regular infusion to look forward to. But this week?

Good luck!",

Heard great things about City of Hope and Cedars both.  Don't think you can go wrong. ",
