She assured me that she thought it was just stretch marks from weight gain that caused the redness and inflammation. She did not think it as IBC, however she still tested it and also for Paget's as well. In the meantime I have had extreme fatigue, naseau, and throwing up. My breast are also very tender and sore. Should I be worried about the punch biopsy results while experiencing these symptoms? Log in to post a reply",

The dr said it was most likely a bug bite. When she examined my Breast she was worried about the color, shape, and size of my right Breast. My nipples were also inverted. She treated me for a breast infection but also scheduled me with a ultra sound. I have gained 25 lbs in the last 6 months so I have really bad stretch marks. I can't tell if the redness, tenderness and ridges are from my stretch marks orif it is Cancer. My doctor also found two lumps around my left nipple. I also should mention that I ihave no kids nor am i breastfeeding. My paternal gma died from breast cancer. Should i be worried??? Log in to post a reply",
