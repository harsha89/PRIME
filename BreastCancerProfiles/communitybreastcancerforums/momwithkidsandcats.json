    "Content": "momwithkidsandcats wrote: I was diagnosed with Stage IV, bone mets, from the start. I had a hysterectomy two years before being diagnosed. I went thru a year of chemo and have been on Armidex, then Aromasin. Recent CT showed mild progression in hip, where mets originally were. My Onc tried to add afinitor to my aromasin, but I turned into a rashy, canker sore filled mess with massive headaches. Yesterday, he said he wants to start me on Zoladex. From everything I have read, this seems to be a treatment for women who have not hit menopause. He is well aware I have had a hysterectomy. Anyone else out there who is post menopause, stage iv, and now on Zoladex? Is it helping? Dx 2/2011, ILC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 9/9 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
