I did ask to see a counsellor and very excited that I will have my first appointmet this Friday. Having cancer is so big that I do need some help to process my feelings, fears etc.             I'm also feeling very unmotivated and have a hard time to do things but since I'm single if I don't do it it's not going to be done, so it's more of a no choice situation. I'm lucky that I'm not working much at the moment so I can concentrate my energies in doing the must dos.I'm also glad we start together, it's good to have somebody to complain to that actually understands what's going on. RS711- I'm so sorry to hear that you are so young, I can understand the shock, it's never fun but you should have to deal with illness at such a young age ):  . I'm 45 and have three kids, 16, 12 and 9.   I haven't spoke with my doc about the BRCA test yet. I certainly will want to do that since I have a daughter, but maybe a bit latter down the road, we have enough to deal with at the moment. ",

I still have to check the scarfs. DesignerMom- even speaking about wigs and stuff sounds sureal...happy that your treatment went well. Today I'm going out on a first date!!

A day before yesterday I did get my period and not only that it wasn't weaker that usual but the bleeding was so heavy that I was worried that I was hemorrhaging, I had one really heavy day  and today it went back to normal but I do feel a little more weak than usual. Other than thatI haven't had almost any se's. Today, a day before two weeks since treatment, my hear started falling , have to glue some, my wig is coming only in a week, Sorry for all of you that have been having a hard time, hope that you all get less and less se's, with every day that passes we get closer to the finish line",

I got into a clinical trial with a drug called Metformin to hopefully reduce the chances of a recurrence.  Great Holidays to everybody andhope that we all have a great, healthy 2011 !  Daniela",

Since I'm on a trial I'm not sure if I'm taking the Metformin or the placebo (keeping my fingers crossed that is the real pill), Sherry - sorry to hear about your grandma, my grandmother died almost 4 years ago and I really miss her, she was 94.  Really happy to hear that the spine thing was only a scare. ",

I have been diagnosed in February and also still feel new to all this. ",

I also feel a bit weird just going like that to my first chemo, especially that its starts at 3pm, .

There are three different exercise  options,1/2 hour aerobics, 1 hour aerobics, and 1/2 aerobics 1/2 weights. The different programs are assigned randomly and I have to wait for the next weeek to find out which one I will be doing. Hoping for the weights one. I heard that exercise really improves well being during chemo and I know that by myself I won't do it. I will provably just lay on the couch in front of the TV and feel sorry for myself . Hope everybody is feeling well and have a good weekend, and welcome for all the new, I hope that I haven't made any gross mistakes in the list, if I did please let me know, Daniela",

I'm also encouraged by the research I got in and seeing the other women in the gym looking so good during treatment. I decided to go alone tomorrow, I do have backup in case I need a ride back. If someone comes with me I will afraid that I will that I have to talk or entertain them in some way during the long wait. I suppose that this is a time in which a partner could come handy. (-: Do you think that it could be possible to bring my laptop to watch a movie during the infusion? I'm happy to hear that you are doing so well ! ",

I had a lumpectomy, my right breast looks a little bit smaller that the other but not very noticeable, also because the scar is on the side the breast, from the front it looks pretty normal. The surgeon suggested a lumpectomy since I have a breast big enough that the results would be good. By the way I lived 25 years in Israel, out since 2001 an live now in Vancouver, Canada  ",

I just sometimes feel that we are being to hard on ourselves wanting to be strong, stay possitive etc.etc. part of that is all the new age psychologies that make us afraid to even feel what we are feeling, there is always this message hanging in the air that we bring to ourselves sickness by having\"negative\" feelings. Like you Sherry  I have always been the strong one but when I was diagnosed I couldn't stop crying for almost two months, and I think that is was good for me to allow myself grief, be terrified, angry etc. Cheyenne, I'm sure it won't continue like that all the time, luckily there is always more supplies of tissue , I believe crying can be only healing, if it is allowing ourselves to feel what we feel and not judge ourselves for that. Being sick sucks.  Anyway...hope that it doesn't sound like preaching just wanted to share some thoughts. Even if I don't ussually write I follow your postings and you are all in my heart.",

I was just wondering if you have any suggestions about the questions that you should have asked your oncologist and you didn't because you didn't know that it was important. I have my first appointment with the oncologist this friday and would like to make the most out of it.   Thanks, and hope that your se's are not too bad, Daniela",
