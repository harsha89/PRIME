For me a shocking process to get here; First ever mammo nov - find small calcification say watch it / 0.7cm Feb - follow up with mammo /ultrasound , they say biopsy it April - biopsy say it looks fine - turns out DCIS /0.7 April - second opinion different centre - they do tests again and MRI / find new areas / biopsy on spot and find invasive cancer May - skin saving mastectomy / first pathology says 13.9cm invasive cancer!!!!! 2nd path that week says only now 3.5cm invasive rest is DCIS So with all these tests andat different places things get missed - does this happen often? No lymph nodes thank god. Her neg. Estro ps. Onctype 48 4 chemo doses and 7 wks radiation as giant tumor had small margins! Good time!!",
