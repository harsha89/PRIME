Part of my \"education\" was that I was given 4 simple exercises to do daily morning and night if I got issues OR just to do them as a prevention thing.. Well I believe these are very beneficial and I have to say they have definitely helped me with pain. I get, with regular monotony, burning and or aching pain under the affected arm (upper) and more recently around the albow AND my shoulder as well as some around the mast sites and axilla when my bodies is TIRED of any thing that passes for a bra (lol). The exercises are very simple and probably well mentioned in other threads so you probabaly know about them anyway... (theyre quite hard to accurately describe) 1/ 30 x \"fist pumps\" - I do this with arm raised straight above my head. I was given a \"cancer ball\" (about 3inches across) and use that to squeeze which I find better than just opening and closing my fist. 2/ 10 \"elbow lifts\" (arms bent) out to the side 3/ 10x \"elbow lifts\"  directly in front, arms bent, fists end up more or less behind your head on the lift. 4/ 10x  \"arm lifts\" (arms straight) out to the side and lifted to above your head. HTHs some. Hugs",

I recall some time ago us talking about your issue and it bothers me that you are still in the woods on this. This must be really AWFUL for you.  LE is something we just cant ignore because if things turn nasty like cellulitis ...well we all can do without that! The crazy thing about all this is measuring up for sleeves and especially gloves is it's anything BUT simple. One little mismeasurement can render a glove useless. I take it, Jobst garments have always tended to be kinda very robust, though the materials my last sleeve is made of is softer. My glove is really good except there is 2 little hard nobs of sewing between the mid and 4th finger at the base. Hard to describe but they actually dig in and leave an indent right at the base of those 2 fingers. Kinda annoying, but overall they help with the swelling on the top of the hand. Mine is minimal though. Another thing to take into account is there are so many variables with this...like not only the heat of summer but so my LEist said, the change in seasons also, which can bring a flare. We have our activities and whether we've overdone that lifting escapade, or if we're not doing enough. We have to factor in our own particular bodies and how we know they function. Has the hospital person said why they don't encourage continued wrapping? From what I read here, the general consensus is that sleeves only \"maintain\" your situation, but its wrapping that actually helps because of the gradual reduction in compression as the bandaging goes to the top of the arm and thereby helping shift the lymph away from the extremity. I've heard others say the wrapping doesnt help and sleeves do so I guess it comes down to our own indiviual situations. Have you been given a time frame for your weekly massage appt's or is that indefinite?",

The fact is NZ is hit and miss and I know Ive gone on about this before, as have others, it would be good to see more consistency. I know somewhere down in the South Island people get supplied with 2 sleeves a year. My LEist told me a custom made Jobst sleeve is a jaw dropping $300 !!! and the glove is the same. I just about fell off my chair...seriously.  I wonder what they are in USA. Oh and the off the shelf ones (Juzo's I think) are a whopping $150! Well I'm anything but out of the woods with this wrapping. I exactly hear you on getting the tension right. ... things are all over the place right now. Seems Ive been doing it too loose and it was worse this a.m after an attempt at re-wrapping last night in fact the whole outfit was slipping down when I got up this a.m. GRRRRR...  ..so I used the sleeve today and there was an improvement tonight when I took it off. The fluid had definitely shifted up some instead of being stuck at a certain place below the elbow. It felt better, but Im getting quite a wide disrtibution of burning pain to the touch around the top of arm (that rounded bit) as well as the usual place in a strip under the upper arm and shoulder blade. I also have been tiring of the sleeve by night time which usually isnt the case. I see LEist on Monday. I'm of the same mind that you definitely need help in learnig to wrap. I feel I should really be seeing her daily until I get this thing sorted, but the sad reality is there is a woeful lack of trained LEists right across the board here. My one is someone I prefer to be very appreciative of because she is so overworked  and overstretched it is ridiculous. I know this is not ideal but we have to do the best we can. I really hope something turns up for you. Another thing I should have done and havent is learn to measure myself properly. Just another thing to add to the growing pile of all that is LE. I literally spent hours getting organized with LE tonight.",

I wouldn't ditch it though, because it MIGHT come in handy somewhere down the track. Ive heard of ladies \"stretching them\" or otherwise dealing to them. The point is ill fitting garments can make you worse off. Hence the necessity of proper fitting. Just as an aside,  like Binney says, we can use old garments for temporary stuff if we know we're gioing to get dirty or something. It'shard for me to come to an exact and accurate description of how things (should) work because I've found my LE has been somewhat sneeky especially in the swelling dept. Its not as if Ive had anything blow up suddenly, or in a marked way, until this recent sceneario. Ive had what I call \"episodes\" of issues like aching, sensitivity and burning pain on an intermittent but ongoing basis right from the start.  These have been helped by 4 simple exercises I was given at the outset. Ive also had minor swelling (odema) issues b4 BC and LE and so that muddies the waters as to what is responsible for what. OK, now for the bandages etc, I'm still finding out exactly what, if anything, will be supplied. I think this all will be out of pocket. Ill report back after appt tomorrow for sure plus I'll also get prices if I can. I was given a couple of rolls of the small bandages, tape, etc, but these current bigger main bandages Im sure were only lent to me.  These were put on me in the following order... (excuse my lack of correct names...Ive just described them) - Finger gauze bandaging about an inch wide (which sorta sticks to itself)...is supposed to last for about 3 washes. ( I cant for the life of me envisage how anyone would be successful at this!)  - tubular cloth (like mutton cloth) with thumb hole cut out...goes next to skin ... overlayed with... -  a soft cotton wool type bandage (about 1/4\" thick) - 3 bandages (not crepe) which are different widths, starting with the narrowest at the hand to the elbow and - Sticky white paperish tape to secure bandages. Yes if we're going to be forking out for this stuff, we want to know its going to work. Musical",

Purple yes please, I d appreciate that re the piks. As for my watch... its on my \"suspected LE\" arm (non dominant). That hand has never swelled as in LE type..., and my watch doesnt bother me, but only the pathetically ill fitting sleeve.....The fact is my arm got SUCH A HARD TIME with chemo, blood tests galore,  BP and everything else you could imagine, it finally said ENOUGH !!!!!    . In the face of much pressure to the contrary, which I withstood BTW, now everything goes in my foot or leg (for BP). Moira How are doing ? Well I asked LEist about prices and she has to \"dig into the system\" to find out as things (products) are changing. The stretch bandages she's lent me to see if they will be suitable. If so she will order me some. As I said they are about 14 to 16$ depending on size. Those crazy lil finger wraps are $3 a roll and at that price you'de be wanting to get a couple of washes in if poss. Reckon Ive worked out a way IF youre careful enough in removing them. If ya scrunch em up...welll NAH... dramas galore and you might as well spit into the wind.. She will supply me and I will get things cheaper by the sounds of it. She's not pleased with the cotton wool padding type bandage which she wont be able to get soon. The new ones apparently are cheaper but you cant wash them, so they'de more than likely work out dearer. Anyway shes put a new padding type on me this a.m.. This time I videod what she did plus I got her doing a test that measures the fluid somehow. She said the testt was more for unilateral patients and because I have issues both sides the results could be somewhat subjective. She had to pay for the machine herself which WASNT CHEAP, but theres a new one that does bilateral patients. It's twice the price and she said she wont be getting that anytime soon. DHB wont pay out for this stuff. The strange thing is in comparing measurements over time, my arm appears to be quite \"stable\" with only very minor variations ...so what about the puffiness thats going on??? go figure! I mentioned Dunedin and the services available and garments supplied for LE patients, and LEist \"thought\" it was good down there. Moira have you asked the people you've been dealing with, what the story is on sleeves being supplied? Please don't let them fob you off. I know this is hard but youre obviously suffering. Well its onto round 2 and LEist has done another nice wrapping job on me.  ",

Binney I was thinking of doing just that. Ringing around. Surely there MUST be something. If we contiually hit a brick wall well hubby will make up something. My dad always had a \"can do\" attitude when it came to such dilemmas. He'd always pull something out of the bag. Lol we still have egg beaters with a screwdriver handle on it. Love it. It epitomizes my Dad to a T. Well, no losing the plot this am! (Binney pass the Choccy please) and I didn't drop any bandages ....but I don;t deserve any really, because I haven't started on the finger wrapping. Im just using my glove. Hey Purple and Denise, I didnt know kinesio was used on the fingers. I'd love to see some piks of that or how that works. I had 2 lots of kinesio up round my shoulder and top of arm, and it irritated me. The 1st app was orange tape and was much worse. I ended up with welts and rashes galore. The questions on bandages and their useful life are also something Im interested to know. Looks like I'll be paying for these out of pocket. NZ has a very different system to US. for things medical.  Some district health boards in NZ fund things differently. For example, in my region I only get one supply of sleeves and gloves per year... other areas get 2. Im sure there would be differences between LEists and how they wrap even if they have the same training or stick to a certain protocol, plus taking into account each individual and their unique needs. That said,  I would strongly advise anyone learning like me, to video the experience. Even with my \"backwards\" version, it has helped immensely. Unfortunately Im one of those who some might call pedantic but I like to pay attention to detail and get it as right as I can.",

Thats one reason why I'm hesitant to get one (paying out of pocket) without trying on one thats the right length. From looking at the specs, it looks like theres only 2 lengths. There is an option for custom made as well.  On the good side, I think it's a garment that would be great if you were able to consistently get that pressure right.",

I thought it would be strong and going woody/stringy but alas it's not strong at all and only slightly stringy on the base part of the larger leaves.  For years I've known that it's commonly used as a crop for stock here (not sure about other places) but I didn't know we could eat it until I heard great reports of it here on BCO.  We also have a local farmers market, and I frequently see it at an Asian guys stand. Ive noticed his variety has very wrinkly/curly leaves. I'm kicking myself cuz I can't remember where I got my little plants from and so don't know if the seed is going to be viable.  I like natural (heirloom) seeds that havent been fiddled with.

Use a knife to make a longitudinal slice just to the skin level and on the \"inside\" of the banana. 3/ prize open with your fingers and the skin will come off as a jacket. If the skin tears or sticks to the banana just leave for another minute or so. 4/ dice and put in bowl or suitable container for whizzing 5/ pour in VERY COLD milk and if its a special time a little cream too! 6/ Add cocoa to taste Thats it.

Enjoyed it. I can see it is going to be a great idea for me. The plan is to get out in the fresh air as much as possible but only use the TM when the weather really packs a sad, or when theres chemtrails. Other than that Im rural and have a fantastic quiet road. I get going early. Things are doable with PN then.  sonson, welcome. I'll let others weigh in on your question. My 2cents If it was me, I wouldnt. Too punishing me thinx.",

That said, ill fitting garments can do more harm than good. From what youve described it sounds to me like your fitter is incompetent. Is the fitter qualified?  I'll try to answer some of your questions with some tips... If you wash your sleeve in water too hot it will shrink and that can make quite a difference especially with a new sleeve. The shrinkage is typically length-ways. It shouldnt take 1/2hr to get sleeve on. There are devices to help donning easier. The ease of donning can be dependent on the grading of the material. Mine is a heavy grade and sure took some getting on when it was new, and yet once on it didn't feel like it was clamping me.  Your thumb should NOT go numb (I have experienced this) BUT, depending on whether the fit is just \"somewhat\" off then yes you can stretch it out with something slightly larger than your thumb.  Im not sure if you mean the garment with a wrinkle, or skin that wrinkles. The elbow area can be VERY problematic. I have some skin wrinkling around the elbow area. Often you'll also get a red line on inside of elbow and that goes as the sleeve is \"broken in\". It's very hard to say \"how tight is right\". You dont say how long your marks remain, but the silicon grip spots can leave little indentations for a little while, maybe an hour, again especially if the garment is new. Aside from the minimal discomfort that accompanies \"breaking in\" it should not cause more swelling and other issues like pain. These are red flags that your garment is ill fitting.  Lastly do not be afraid to stand your ground with your fitter if these garments are not to your satisfaction. Im from NZ and Countries differ widely in what procedures you must go through in dealing with LE. If you are from US, lets hope the US ladies will chime in and give you a heads up on what you should do. Hope this helps and all the best.. Musical",

As usual I don't look forward to summer in this respect. No doubt most of you guys will be very familiar with the (American) TEVA brand and I find these a boon as they cushion my feet well and are the least heat inducing footwear I can find. Anything that buffs your feet are OUT!!! Even on a frosty winter's morn with a brisk walk I find I have to rip my socks off midwalk and just have the Tevas on or my feet are on fire before Im done. You learn your work-arounds because you have to. LOL If it was a competition Id be at the back of the line...indeed any progress is good. For that I'm grateful.",

What I do I do under duress. I have permanent non chemo induced PN (peripheral neuropathy) and if theres anything worse than LE, its that. My feet BURN like they are on fire and as many people on BC.ORG testify, (because its a side effect of some chemos) you can only stay on your feet for so long beofre they ache and burn and get VERY crazy. My work around is this: I walk most days at the crack of dawn (the colder the better) and I try to do about 2 miles a day. Ive recorded my walks and distance for about 4 years. The only time I miss is when its hosing down or something unusual has come up. Without looking and doing some number crunching my guesstimate is Ive averaged about 2 miles a day 6 days a week this year so far. I went to GP appt and he was very pleased that even though my bad cholesterol was up, so was my good cholesterol which somehow counteracted it. (not sure how it all works) He said my exercise has definitely helped. Part of this aspect was taken into account to assess my risk for heart attack and he said at my age he couldn't have been more happy. Im soooo pleased. A little good news goes a long way! It's not easy with Arimidex playing it's part in making my bones and joints ache but I feel the exercise has really helped here too and overall the aching is not what it was. Hopefully this will encourage the less fit amongst us that every little bit helps.",

As a lot of us lament, its one of the last places to shift.  Up until a couple of weeks ago was doing really well on the Treadmill but its only a momentary setback. I feel I'm gaining in fitness overall. The little setback is I probably pushed a little too hard on the stretchies afterwards and I think I strained my upper thigh/groin area or something. Its still quite grabby and I'm taking care to do longer warm-ups. Im getting there, but noticing these things take longer to come right these days.  I'm also using a \"stand-in\" treadmill albeit at no extra cost as mine has \"belt wandering\" issues and has done almost from the start when I purchased it at the end of January this year. The issue has run into months now and I'm starting to get pretty annoyed. Apparently I'm not the only one with this model and there's in fact a recall so I was told by the service man.  We'll see what happens. Been doing quite a bit in the garden. Spading weeds etc We all know gardening definitely counts as excercise! The main spud crop is just about done so really pleased. Hubby is a great help. Recently tried my Kale and yum.

A few months ago I pulled a muscle in my buttock doing stretches. Been going to a physio and for such a minor injury I wouldve thought it would have been healed ages ago. Before this nonsense I was fair crackin along for me, and now Ive had to reduce both distance and time dramatically and slowly work back up. Also my faulty treadmill has finally gone back, after a long wrangle with the company who sold it. I'm LOST without my treadmill. In the interim Ive got options- replace my tired raincoat - I'll probably purchase some time at the local gym - Fortunately the wild spring is behind us and I can do my road time again. So Im up to doing 2K in 1/2hr. (approx) My speed is 30% slower :-(. If I get pain spikes above 3/10 then I have to reduce. Those are getting less now, so heres hoping.   ",

With precautions you greatly lessen your chances of getting the dreaded cellulitis, and it isn't necessarily so that we will get it when we have a cut, bite etc, but wisdom tells us we must be careful. Of course prevention is always going to be better than cure, but we need to live as well. We're not going to stop every scratch scrape and nick. Aside from the regular precautions like moisturizing area,  keeping hydrated etc, I carry an antibiotic cream at all times, and I can't tell you how many times its saved my butt.  Hopefully with your situation you can find one that you can tolerate. I would definitely talk to your doctor if I were you and get something so that you can have more peace of mind.  As for it starting elsewhere, I'm not sure about that. Perhaps someone will chime in on that. I would think it's probably more likely to occur at the injury site, but I wouldn't rule out that it depends on where your LE is more troublesome.  First there was BC then there was LE.

I'm pretty sure with cellulitis it finds a way in through the skin. As for me, I had it once a few years prior to BC in the shin. I had no scratch, bite or other little injury. I was puzzled until the my GP told me it can come through the slightest microscopic skin crack, even that which we can't see. In my case I may have had some fluid retention which caused the skin to be tighter than normal. That's what I put it down to. It certainly makes sense. I was within an hour or so of being hospitalized. Thankfully I dodged that bullet. If you have any type of swelling it's all the more reason to keep the area well moisturized as a preventative. I'm not sure what C Diff is, but it doesn't sound nice. I really hope you can get this sorted. I don't think you would get celulitis from Hubby but if it's a bug which generally needs antibiotics then obviously prevention is a very wise course for you. When I was doing Chemo, I would not go near anyone and I made sure my Hubby was vigilant too. I still managed to get ill being neutropenic on the 1st round spending over a week in the dreaded hospital, but thats a bit different. My doctor said it can come from within you and quite often they can't find how you got a bug.  All the best.",

It is important if your allergies drive you crazy with itching, which is usually the case, to see your Doctor about which ointments which are right for you because a lot of them will be hydrocortisone based. These vary in strength and my understanding it's important to not have these any stronger than you need but rashes and such need dealing with ASAP. I have battles with these but my ointments have kept me out of trouble so far. It's also important to deal with any itching as soon as possible as you can scratch and then it can become infected with a real risk of getting cellulitis.

Another lady who is part of my onc team also didnt discourage me either, in fact they gave me the idea that they thought it was a reasonable action to take. I guess its each individual persons choice as to how \"proactive\" they want to be and of course measuring that up with the liklihood of risk for your situation. For me, theres  no way do I want to get a clot. I also base my decision on the premise that some people are more at risk of getting clots than others, like if you have varicose veins for example.  My understanding (which is far from complete on this) is that Tamox stays in your system for 2 weeks and so its also minimal risk stopping it briefly. This info is all pretty new to me and its only been recently that Ive been able to actually able to face getting  in and doing some research.  All the best for your surgery on Wednesday.",

I caught it from an old peoples home earlier on this year. I'd NEVER want a repeat of that. Ughhh. So much for the so-called 72hr quarantine. There really is some nasty bugs around.

It is a very wise thing to have this cream on hand at all times and I have my lil bag of goodies I lug around too. Did you have a qualified person who measured you up for your sleeve and glove.

You are doing the right thing with MLD and exercises, as long as you have been shown properly what to do. I don't know what your dx is but Im sorry to say LE is a condition we do have to watch and learn to live around. Sometimes the learning curve can be steep, but overall it get easier as time goes on. There are many great articles on here and knowledgeable ladies plus the stepupspeakout website to help you along the way. It is best to tend to cuts etc as quickly as possible.

I have had so many dramas with this I cringe at the thought of my next appt and what it's going to entail. One of the many episodes Ive had was when I was in Onc ward for being neutropenic after 1st chemo, an incompetent doctor tried to do a foot draw and dug and dug and turned and twisted...... and failed. I was sooo distraught and angry I cried for hours and hours through the night. I went so far into orbit I can't even remember what they did or who they got to finally get one done. After many issues and nightmares, earlier on this year I was able to have an official meeting with the appropriate people and my idea was to put forward that BC patients need to be given extra care when it comes to BP, draws etc. OK some DON'T have issues and I'm happy for them, but some us DO! My reasoning was that other patients get the equipment and services pertinent their needs, why not BC patients who veins are tricky! This is NOT a case of being demanding and wanting favouritism as some might imply, but a NECESSITY. My veins are such a problem I was able to recount and put forward how beneficial it was, when I had a procedure which required an anesthetic, the anesthetist very easily got a vein in my foot using an US and with a local A. It was sooo wonderful. So, I have all needles done out of/into my foot. There is a nurse who is very good at blood draws and as long as I'm lying flat and do what she says, there isn't  a problem, but anything that goes \"in\" they have agreed to allow me the afore said service. As for my my prophylactic Mx side, its curtains due to chemo and everything else it's had to endure like BPs. It's still saying enough!!!! No more. My BC side seems to be doing much better then Prophy side, which is deemed as having  \"suspected LE\". They even did my final chemo in the LE side. Gentle hugs to all who fight this monster.",

I would be spitting tacks too. Gentle hugs. The good side to this is that the chances of you not getting LE are good, but nevertheless the downside is that now, you will always have it hanging over your shoulder that you just might. There are things you can do to minimize that risk considerably which shouldn't be a total deal breaker. In addition to what BayouBabe has said, just be careful of bites nicks scrapes burns hangnails and the like etc and that you have antibiot cream handy at all times to ward off possible cellulitis. Try not to subject your arm to too much heat or cold. Keep well hydrated, and keep arm welll moisturized. All these are doable without too much disruption to our lives. I hope you never have to deal with LE",

The idea for me would be to just sit my breast forms in there and I reckon theyd stay in place. Only problem is they only come in black and that is a dodgy option for me.

Exactly mimikitty. Sorry you are going throguh all this.  Now, I was told that RT posed no risk to getting LE. I tend to think that is  rubbish. I was OK then straight after RADS wham along comes LE. Also, I later had a prophy and even on prophy  'good' side  when they dont mean to take lymph nodes out, because of the nature of the surgery, there is a chance that some can be still be taken. Also your 'good' side is at risk as well, for the rest of your life. There is a recent study that proves this.  You are doing the best you can and its sad that we largely have to be our own advocate in all this, but in the end, vigilance is far better than blissful ignorance. If LE comes along , there,  most certainly the bliss ends.  Theres only one way to deal with LE and thats properly. Im glad your sleeve is not troubling you so much. My skin is super sensitive and I uese sunlight soap... I dont know if US ladies have it there (Im NZ). Its extremely mild and no fragrance. A lot of the time fragrances can really cause problems.  Youre right about LE being worse. I can totally understand that. LE is for the rest of your life...with cancer its fine, after all the drama, IF  it doesnt come back. How the heck are we supposed to forget, with all this hanging over our heads??? That makes me livid when people say that.  Fine if they want to do that, but dont push it onto those of us who have issues after the fact. djls some good info in your post.  I really have been thinking about measuring my arm myself. Again...so much for forgetting, but we gotta do what we gotta do.",

Theres some real neat ladies on here who know so much. Kira and Binney are amazing as are others. I'll give you a headsup on what I know and what Ive learned here.....  Cellulitis is THE pits BIG TIME. It has the potential to be extremely dangerous turn very nasty and it is life threatening. Another thing Ive just learned form here is that every time you get it it does more damage, like an accumulating affect. Gee, great isnt it. (NOT) What the general concensus is, is this. -  Dont overheat your arm.   -  Dont scratch or injure your arm if you can help it -  Stay away from BP tests, needles ( blood draws, etc)  -   Keep your arm well moisturized -  Dont overwork it Always have antibiotic cream for bites scratches and anything that punctures the skin. Apply immediately and if it doesnt improve get help. Somebody might want to chime in on a time limit here. For me, for example, last night I was getting a peice of wood to put on the fire. I got a little splinter  in my finger crease of COURSE of my LE arm. It was hurting and I had to dig it out with a needle. So it was straight under the tap to wash, dry then put the cream on and cover. I was off to bed and if it wasnt better by morning it would be off to GP. Well this a.m. its as good as. NO pain. no extra redness. I find the cream is EXCELLENT, and its saved the day many times.  If you do get a little injury no matter how small watch watch watch for any redness that spreads. The 1st sign get to Doctor ASAP. These all can be forerunners to cellulitis.  Remember for the rest of our lives, we will forever have to be on guard that we dont compromise our arm/s.  Hope this helps",

One fairly recent addition I can add is stabbing pains. Thankfully they don't last for long, but they are intensely painful. I take a minimal dose of gabapentin so it only just takes the edge off. Any significant walking is absolutely out for me other than first thing in the morning, though I have a bit more flexibility in the winter as summer is much worse.

In the end 3 doctors apparently had to agree before they would go in my Lymphoedema arm.   I was extremely neutrapenic after the 1st CHemo and had to go to Hospital for 5 days on IV antibiots. Knowing that blood tests were going to be a part of it all I tried to be very brave. They couldnt get anything off me and started going for the foot. The guy left the needle in and poked and poked and POKED! Well folks I lost it. I think I cried all night. That experience NEVER leaves me. I shudder every time I think of it. Well this sad tale has a good side to it and I dont know what happens in America or elsewhere but FWIW in NZ I was able to ask for a finger prick. WOW! It made a HUGE difference. The head Onc Guy told me, everything they needed to know could be got out of a finger prick.  There are other times though they have to go for the veins.  Fortunately I NEVER saw another needle.     Pity they didnt tell me that straight away.

I don't know if there's any studies done to substantiate this  though. It could have all sorts of side issues like what else a person has going on health-wise.

The first generation using this technology was introduced with the Finapres™ device developed by Wesseling et al. [47] in the early 1980s. UNQUOTE I know things can change quickly where technology is concerned, but I've never seen any BP units where there isnt a cuff involved for your arm or leg. Are these common in the US? The finger cuff method looks great!  I havent read all of the very long article but I skimmed through trying to find out what they mean by invasive and non invasive. I saw reference to an arterial canula (YIIIIKKES OUCH! ) as the Invasive method so Im not sure where this all fits in to LE risk. It seems to me they are saying Cuffs are non invasive. That said they still can cause damage and compromise our lymph system. ",

I'm one of those who doesn't see the point in downplaying the facts and I do try to tell it like it is BUT laced with plenty of warm gentle hugs too. If there are good options then as some have stated here, we should take those into account too. It's a balancing act but there is ABSOLUTELY NO POINT in burying your head in the sand about this LE either. Im saying this because Ive heard more than one person here say LE is actually WORSE than having BC. So, knowledge about this SCUMBAG condition is the key. You have every right to be worried and upset. As having BC I think it is HARSH to be called out for \"not doing your research\". Let me tell you... the medical profession are the ones who should be informing us and whats more, when you've got a dx to try and get your head around, well if you can stomach research then great, but don't slight those who don't because they can't (for whatever reason). We're all different. I couldn't. I was so in shock nothing would sink in anywayz. While I'm at it Ill say this. You never know what anyone else is going through. Just because we've had a Cancer dx it doesnt mean that is all there is to life past present and future. LE IS a scary prospect and though its good to quote figures, the fact is those figures mean squat if we are the ones who are in the 1% crowd. Its as simple as that. In other words, the fact is YES you most likely will not need to be concerned but on the other hand there's ladies here who have only had ONE node out and have bilateral LE. Its ALWAYS a double edged sword for ANYONE who had had nodes out. The question is, then, how much are we going to do or take on board to circumvent LE. (Preventatively) I can guarantee it wont be as much a dealbreaker as if we get LE because we did nothing. These days people don't bat an eye about bareface lying and other insidious behaviours. The medical profession is NO exception. Please consider my little piece below. What SpecialK says is probably right. Me thinks it would be very wise to have facts and proof otherwise legal action could be more trouble than it's worth. AUDIO RECORDING After catching up on this thread I am only too well reminded of some advice I wrote up somewhere, a few years back on BCORg. I can't understate how convenient (in more ways than one)it is to take a voice recorder to ALL your appts. Caveat: Make sure you are aware of your relevant laws for your jurisdiction. The law for audio is actually quite different to video and indeed can be more restrictive. In my country only one person in the conversation has to be aware it is taking place but this is not so in other countries...which brings me to this point: either way, its a good thing to let the people know you want to record your meetings/appts. I got the odd one who didnt like it but most were OK when I said things like theres too much to take in and we find it helpful to go over the info later. Youd be surprised how much you miss, even if you have a support person with you. HTHs.",

Gee doesn't it make us feel great when we have to deal with obstinate Meds and barge our way in to get even simple things done. NOT. I still would stand by what I say about getting a family member to do it for you pre surgery, ADDITIONALLY to a prfessional. Why? Because you have your own measurements to fall back on if for some reason you can't get the same person measuring you after surgery, OR you get someone who is not that great at it.  BUT, in saying that I think consistency has a part to play here and it would need to by someone accessible (like hubby) and that they measure in the same places and at the same tightness. Just as an example, my hubby at first fumbled (lol, and was VERY patient at my impatience) but in a couple of days got the hang of it and measured very consistently at the same tightness. \"For a time there, I thought I was being silly about pushing this.\"  LOL now you know different! Definitely not silly. Binney - Thankyou for your comments on rashes. I'm finding I have to look sideways at anything to do with \"sticky adhesives\" or tape. It's a real pain because even ordinary plasters are suspect. Fortunately theres more than one way around this and one can use gauze bandaging then put the sticky over that. I remember having so many dramas about this through all my treatment, like waking up from surgery and a hospital pillow (with some kind of plastic covering) had come into contact with my shoulder giving me a very nasty rash which took ages to get rid of. Even the gel they use on ultrasound gave me a rash...UGH. Next time I will have to remember to wash the area ASAP afterwards. (Better still, I hope there isnt a next time) \"Water displacement is rarely used--it's messy, but accurate when done well. -\" I never knew about this method until very recently when I followed a link from a post here somewheres. I was fascinated with it, but the study didnt describe exactly how this is done. Do you know of any links so I could see how they do it? I imagine it would be VERY accurate but Im still trying to figure how they would do it...LOL right now Im dreaming up things like arms dropped into small long cylinders of water but .... would you need to be standing or lying down?....I would LOVE to see a pik. SpecialK I wouldnt change a thing either with what I did even though I HATE LE and how it interferes with my life (but that might change if I learn something I couldve done but didnt know about...or have just plain forgotten). As I keep saying, there are no decent choices with BC, its always the choice of the lesser of 2 evils. I wanted to throw everyhing I had at it. Indeed it does come down to a personal choice of how you want to balance risk with QOL with dare I say it whether you want a life.",

Of course because our health systems can be based on a totally different premise, like things are funded differently etc. that has a major bearing on how we can effectively discuss this aspect. The foot naturally poses more risk (LE risks aside) because it has a dense concentration of nerves, veins, ligaments etc and its great when it goes right but brutal when it doesnt. I can't imagine how \"dangerous\" I might get even thinking about the sole of the foot Midnight! I better laught instead... Someone please correct me here if Im wrong or indeed giving correct but incomplete info....Im not totally sure but pretty sure that a tumor on the opposite side to the 1st ocurrence can only be a  PRIMARY tumor and means you havent had a reocurrence as such.  In other words its not metastatic, or secondaries from the primary tumor on the 1st side . Regarding node removal,  it would naturally figure that they would only then take nodes from that side. Let me put it another way to also include when people simultaneously get BC on both sides... Whether BC occurs in both breasts at the same time or not, they are both independant of each other and both have \"primary\" tumors. I know nexxt to nothing about the other lesser known BC types but I'm talking mainly about IDC.",

Once you manage to actually get it, then you have to get someone whose competent at it. I would unequivoacally state that the difference here can be night and day. Long story short, I had an incompetent doctor (unsuccessfully) attempt to do this when I needed a blood test when I was in hospital after 1st chemo. It was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. He wouldn't stop driling and twisting and turning. I was SO ANGRY I cried all night. I was neutropenic as it was and had numerous attempts in my \"good\" arm. Equally painful or worse was a surgeons effort to give me a sedative in the foot for a procedure which left me with a damaged nerve. There is a couple of ladies of much \"lower rank\" who are both excellent for blood draws. Im mentioning all this to encourage people that there can be a big difference and that difference is not necessarily from some high up dude with big credentials although I relaize theres a difference between \"input\" and \"output\".

I would have to say this is one of the worst things I have ever had the misfortune to experience. They reckon outside of kidney stones this is the most painful thing there is. I dont know about you others but they sure are a miserable business. My type of shingles were the Herpes Zoster type. I know of Herpes simplex, (coldsores) but are there others?  My understanding about HZ is that rarely do you get it when youre young, (pre 30ish )  it is always or usually one sided. ( Im a bit rusty on the details) I had mine in my late teens.....also Im sure they said something about you only get them once. I remember the Doctor sending me to hospital because of abdominal pain like you wouldnt believe, but nothing to show for it, and this got worse and worse all night and I had some pain killers which barely touched it. I remember moaning in utter agony and a nurse thought I was putting it all on. Unbelievable but it was another patient who saw the rash in the morning and correctly diagnosed what it was. I wont tell you what I said to that nurse. As soon as the blisters broke out, the pain started to abate. Cant remember how long it took, but probably inside a week. Well that was the easy part, because let me tell you, that was NOTHING compared to the itch that followed. It took something like 6 weeks to even start to abate. I will never ever in all my days forget the itch. It took years and years to completely go away.  I would hope that no one would ever have to go through that hell with the modern drugs they have today. Has anybody had this same itch and successfully fixed it with meds? ",

That parts hard to swallow coz I like to be organized about things and have some common guidelines and the more the merrier. Makes life easier. That said I sure seem to be one of the ones thats dragging the chain for working out what works for me. LOL sneaky little dickens alright :-). Yeah. Im watching and the latest new kid on the block is sundry burning sensations in new places. LEist told me I had a hot elbow last time I went. I know this year the LE has progressed and so yes I must admit I've found it hard. On a good note, the other night after I was getting more and more annoyed but still kept persevering, I had really good results (the best so far) from wrapping. Hubby helped me and he had to put up with my agro. (He deserves a medal) Measuring specialist is back next week and Im having another appt midweek so we'll see what he says about my jobst which is STILL leaving a red welt on the inner bend of my arm and though the weight of fabric is more robust its still not maintaining my overnight arm size. Weird. My glove also has two little hard \"tits\" that develop at the base from the stitching, in between the two middle fingers. The last glove did the same thing.",

Bet I have to do all sorts of hoop jumping to make sure this is followed up on, meaning, you can never relax about being your own best advocate. On a procedure before all this an anesthetist used an ultrasound guided placement. It was EXCELLENT. Thats how tricky my veins are. I'll say this FWIW. *NEVER* let anyone incompetent poke you in the foot. NEVER!!!!!. That includes surgeons, doctors or the humble learner. It must be someone who knows what theyre doing. If there IS no-one, then look at other options like the neck which, granted, sound extremely scary but Binney says its not so bad. It could be an option. Back to the foot....As we all know, there is a close network and plethora of veins, tendons, nerves and they can slide all over the place. Clots aside...there is a real risk that you can suffer nerve damage as I have from an ill placed needle and that was from a SURGEON! . Yes we all face risks anyway but my point is, we've had enough on our plates already without this added risk of incompetency, and DONT START ME ON THE ARGUMENTATIVE TYPES  GRRRRRRRR!!!

This may carry on like this for a while til one day they overdo something or take a long plane trip somewhere of lift something heavy....next minute their arm blows up or they get some worse pain.  I was ASTOUNDED when my LEist who covers a wide area, effectively told me I was the only one of her patients who wrapped!

I have allergies too, and I experienced exactly what you did, but Ive not had it since. OTH it just may be that your sleeve was a little too tight, as it still may be in the \"breaking in\" period. It's always best to \"introduce\" ourselves to our new sleeves, slowly increasing the time. Of course that will depend on each of us and is very much an individual experience. It's common to have that red mark to start with in the crease of the elbow as is the case with slightly redder hand. These could be indicative of a bad fit or an off the shelf sleeve, where possibly you need to be fitted. It's a fine line as to when these things need to be taken further. That you were pretty active and your sleeve pretty new, may have been the cause. I see it's a couple of days since your post. How are those red dots now?",

I take it they alter these rather than give you a straight out new garment? IF they do this and return it, how long would I expect to wait? I'm picking something like a month, no? Also this garment has been causing a VERY red mark on the inside at the elbow area. I know this is a pretty common complaint but this is quite bothersome by the end of the day. Ive been wearing it just over a month. Shouldnt be doing that now. Anyway if this happens, I can see me making real good use of the time by : a/ getting into wrapping again ... LOL just the catalyst I need. b/ See if I get much joy out of my 1 month old OTS juzo which I wear on my prophy side. You never know. Im also dealing with my Jobst glove (for the 2nd time) where there is a little hard notch right at the base between my 2 middle fingers. The last glove had 2 of these notches and my new one has one (so far). Essentially they dig in and by the end of the day the area is very sore causing me to take the garment off. As such, Im pulling from my various \"backup bunch\" (lol) Has anyone else had these little contemptuous notches develop? Im thinking its maybe just the shape of my fingers causing it because we looked carefully at the new glove before I donned it and it definitely didn't appear to have any doubled up sewing or anything. When I told the measurer about these notches he told me if this happens again to let him know, so my LEist already knows and it looks like I'll be seeing him in a month or so again. Also in the meantime I have been lent a \"sample\" Juxtafit which I have to return in a week. It is just to \"play around\" with. It's waaaaay too long but Im just trying it on to get the concept of how it works. Any caveats about this garment anyone? Anyone tried it and loved it? When my LEist tried it on me very briefly at the end of appt before last, I was STUNNED that in just a few minutes it had taken the swelling down below my elbow!!! Binney, one thing I have heaps of confidence in is my LEist certainly knows how to wrap. The trial and error for my LEist and I has been to watch my fingers. The one time I thought it MAY have been just a tad tight at the top, (because my fingers were getting redder) and she thought so too, so she loosened it off just a tad and a couple of hours later it was all baggy and had to be redone, so she had it right the first time. Ive found initially when she wraps, my fingers definitely go more red but she told me when you push your finger if the red doesn't return reasonably soon then get it off, or if the fingers go blue. The initial redness which I consider OK disappears pretty soon, like generally between 10mins to a 1/2 hour. I guess this is all just part of that learning curve we all have to do as individuals. Linda Ive just this minute taken my glove off because my finger ends are swelling a little and Im using an old gauntlet I was given just to try and told not to bother returning. I've found its comfy and doing a better job around the swelling of my hand just below the wrist. I hope the garment you are waiting for is the right one so you can get your swelling down too! Awww Soorrrry for the long winded post.",

Sorry its back to the drawing board with your sleeves and gloves. I wear a Juzo OTS (off the shelf) for my prophy side which has \"suspected\" LE. That sometimes leaves indentations at the wrist but I dont find it causes any issues and theyre gone before long. I reckon I'm going to try and REMEMBER (sigh sigh) to take it off earlier each day instead of wearing it all day like my LE side. Hoping you find something works great for you.",

You don't say what type of chemo you've done, but it's a well known fact the taxanes can cause neuropathy. That said, I did 4 rounds of FEC and my PN (peripheral neuropathy) got worse. I had PN before BC though. Even though there are different types of neuropathy, those symptoms you describe are pretty much par for the course. I had nerve conduction tests. Maybe you need to press for a nerve conduction test? If your doctor won't listen, maybe its time for a second opinion. You shouldn't have to put up with this. From what I can remember some peoples chemo induced neuropathies can get less over time although others not. All the best for you getting this sorted. Its a horrible debilitating condition.

So...my understanding is that both arms are still at risk even if we only have a unilateral Mx, but the risk would be naturally be more with a BMx.",

Thanks for your post Carol. I have been thinking about a recent measurement difference of 5cm and your explanation has helped me get a wider picture of that. Ariom, I have very minimal (almost zero) swelling in the hand and that is only fairly recent. My LE started in my upper arm and just this year has become quite a problem below the elbow for no apparent reason. Lili never ever ever feel embarrassed to ask questions. The only dumb one is the one you don't ask. Hope that puts you at ease. Gentle and warm hugs. :) Regarding drains, I remember being told that the longer drains stay in the more chance of infection and the general consensus was that it was about 3 weeks max that they would leave drains in. Maybe things have changed now but one thing we all either know or come to know, there is a serious lack of consistency as to what constitutes dx, treatments,etc, but maybe that's because we're all so different. Sometimes we wonder...the only consistency is the inconsistency of it all and LE sure falls into that category. proudtospin I hear you on the wrong bras... just last night I had to ditch em because they decided they werent going to be good girls like they usually are. The trouble spot was where I had a seroma on my prophy side (11mths after 1st mx) and the fluid has never really dissipated. BS told me it was just fat .... yeah right, great deduction since my BC side doesn't have this \"flab\". jarris thats an unusual situation for sure. Good on you for getting onto it. At least you were informed that it's possible, unlike some of us and it is a good thing to be informed early on about LE. Lets hope your appt goes well for you.",
