I think the lesson to be learned though, is to be your own best advocate.  If you have one Dr. telling you there's no need for an MRI, and in your gut, you think you should have one, you need to push until it gets done.  Get out the phone book, and dial every dr. there is, until you'll find someone to do it for you.",

Depending on the unclear margins, there are options. 1. re-excision 2. mastectomy with or without reconstruction 3. start chemo now, and do surgery after I had a lumpectomy first, then chemo, then bilateral mastectomies with reconstruction, then a year of herceptin. I just think a second opinion will be helpful in your mom's case. Good luck, and she's lucky to have such a GREAT and smart daughter!!!",

Here's a link of what to ask when you consult with your surgeon: http://www.breastreconstruction.org/Section1/What_do_i_ask_my_doctor.html Also, If you have one breast reconstructed, by law, you can have the other breast match as well... here's more info: http://www.breastreconstruction.org/InsuranceCoverage.html If you wondering what the difference is between immediate and delayed reconstruction: http://www.breastreconstruction.org/Section1/ImmediatevsDelayed.html As far as your decision to take one or both breasts, it should be based on a variety of things and this decision should not be rushed. The girls here will give you great insight as to why they did what they did- but keep in mind that everyone is different, and we all made decisions based on things that work and fit into our lives. For me, the decision to take the healthy breast was based on my age at diagnosis, and high risk of recurrence, the fact that I wanted a matching set for vanity reasons, I didn't want to have to deal with mammo's and ultra sounds every 6 months to a year for the rest of my life, and for me, the risk of developing cancer in the breast (remember, that doesn't mean you're in the clear to never get cancer again) was lowered to 1-2% for the rest of my life after having the mastectomies-- for me, it worked. But it's a process- and it will never be an easy decision. As for your friends telling your you're strong- this is one of my favorite lines given by our non cancer friends-- the truth of the matter is, that this has nothing to do with strength-- you're in this, no matter what.  The choice is easy, fight the cancer, or bury your head in the sand, and clearly, you're not going to do the latter-- so you fight.  I don't need to tell you that you're strong-- but I can tell you that you have everything you need already inside of you to get through this, and this sisterhood will be the added bonus for you.  My advice is to try to take things one step at a time- I know it's a lot at once coming at you in the beginning.  I agree with the poster above who wrote you should make a list of the Pro's and Con's to having one breast removed or both... Come here to talk, and of course we are here as your sounding board!  I'm sure family and friends are givcing you a ton of advice-- you've got to trust your gut, and go with what you think is the best thing for your body, mind and spirit.",

My favorite explanation which was given to me by someone on these boards about why we got cancer, was b/c we're women, and Sh*t happens. I'm in Long Island- so not up near you, but I was drawn to your name-- my brother is a farrier, and does travel upstate for a few horses from time to time. You won't have to give up riding during treatment, there will just be more days when you're tired, and don't feel like tacking your horse by yourself.  Welcome to the sisterhood-- we'll be here for everything.  If you scroll down further on the boards you'll find a forum for stage 3 gals, and I know you'll get more sound and wonderful support and advice. Of course it's hard to imagine having cancer at this age, and at this stage, but you're young and tough, and it sounds like you're not taking cancer sitting down.  The journey gets easier.  I promise.  The beginning is the shock/surgery/information overload.  Then the active treatment actually gets easier, b/c you have a plan, and a schedule, and all you have to do is rest and heal.  Before you know it you'll be entering the world of moving beyond-- this I can tell you.  Time flies even when you're not having fun.

I'm wondering why your surgeon told you to wait for reconstruction?  Have you met with a plastic surgeon to discuss your options? It's very rare for young women (especially our age) to have delayed reconstruction unless there are more than 3 nodes positive.  Obviously, there are more psychosocial issues that come along with getting breast cancer so young, and studies show that immediate reconstruction can be very beneficial. I know all the girls at the YSC will give you great advice- I'm glad you found the site.  Let me know if there's anything I can do for you.",

But, this really is just temporary, and it will get better. There are some things you can do to help with healing. Be very mindful of your lifting restrictions, and don't over do it with laundry, vacuuming, or over exerting yourself. Now is the time to take care of you. You should eat a diet that is full of lean protien mixed with calcium, to speed in healing. Drink plenty of fluids, and get as much sleep as possible.  The internal dialogue thats racing through your head won't help your external healing at all. I know, it's hard to just silence your feelings and thoughts, but your body just went through a big surgery, and you have to honor that, and just try to sit back while your body does its thing.... some of us are slower healers then others, so just be patient.  The thing about expanders, is that you've got a lot of time before you get to the final result. You are officially a work in progress, and even though there will be some hiccups along the way, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And you will get the results you desire. If your skin is thin, and you can't get the expanders filled at the rate you had hoped, there are still other options, like adding a dermal matrix, or a latissimus flap to give you the size you desire. Give yourself a break. All of these moments where you feel broken, or damaged... well, those are just moments. It's not who you are, and I know you're not going to let cancer have one up on you. Screw Cancer... You'll take back what it tried to steal away--trust me on that one. We're with you all the way. Every day won't be this hard. You're in it for hte long haul, and you've got to just trust in the process. We'll be here for you to lend an ear, hold a hand, or give you a much needed laugh.",

It will end up being a very frustrating, at times maddening process, but there needs to be some negotiating with the amount of that bill. That price just doesn't sit well with me. My PS was the surgeon that headed up the AlloDerm and now Strattice trials, so when I get a chance I'm going to ask him if that price is reasonable. Even still- everyone over charges, and then there's bargaining that can happen between all parties involved. Femme-- your situation is so unfortunate.  I can't even imagine everything that you must have gone through.  How is the recovery and healing process going?  I can't help but wonder instead of using more AlloDerm than permitted by the data from the trials, why wouldn't the PS have done a lat flap, or is that what he did? Either way, I am so sorry for everything you're going through.  I hope the new PS that you are seeing is able to repair everything. Lifecell was recently bought out by Kinetics (the company that makes the wound vacs) but I'm pretty sure the lifecell web site is still active.  You can get a list of doctors that were in the trial if you are about to undergo surgery and need AlloDerm.  Then, if that PS isn't in your network, you could argue with your insurance, and possibly bargain about using an in netwrok PS, but having the AlloDerm covered. Obviously, this is always going to vary on an individual basis.",

As far as not having safety standards for AlloDerm: this is from lifecell: Since AlloDerm® is derived from human tissue, there may be a concern that it might harbor disease carrying viruses. However, with more than one-million implants and grafts to date, the safety of AlloDerm® has been proven, as there has never been any evidence of viral disease transmission to any patients. Tissue donors are screened and tested for transmissible diseases, and a comprehensive review of each donor is completed by a medical director before allowing the tissue to be processed. It doesn't have to be FDA approved b/c it's tissue, not a medical device- that was my understanding. ",

You can have radition, and if it damages the breast, then there are options to fix it.  If you decided on Mastectomy that is still an option too.  I would talk to you surgeon about it.

I opted for a lumpectomy first. I was healed in time for the party, although there were times I had an icepack under my shawl of the dress. Then, knowing the cancer was out of me, I moved forward with treatment.  The lumpectomy left my breast pretty deformed.  It was a whole size smaller than the other breast.  I began chemo, and started researching about my risk for recurrence, and I also was thinking about how much I did not want radiation. After chemo, I had bilateral mastectomies with immediate reconstruction.  I had plenty of time to do my research and figure out the type of reconstruction that was right for me, and I didn't have to be without a breast. The only downside was getting fitted for my bridesmaid dress a few weeks before surgery.  I was trying to explain to the lady that my top size wouldn't be the same, but she told me they would alter everything. So, I got to skip radiation, and after reconstruction I did my year of herceptin, and that was that. I know the order I did things was backwards- but it totally worked for me. I didn't have to make a rushed decision about the mastectomy, and being able to have immediate reconstruction played a part in giving me a great aesthetic result. I know this isn't easy.  I just wonder if your breast surgeon would maybe give you that option-- to do the lumpectomy now, to get all the cancer, and then you'll recover before the wedding--then when life slows down for a second, you can revisit and have more time to decide.",

For all the moms who are BRCA positive, and wondering about their young daughters, there is amazing information at www.facingourrisk.org Mammos are not the answer for young women. Dense breasts generally prevent mammos from working effectively on young women. BSE's every month two weeks after your period, and alternating an ultra sound and an MRI yearly is the safest way to go. I learned alot after being diagnosed at age 26, and knowing that 15,000 young women will get cancer in the US this year, I think every woman should be armed with knowledge. There are several statistics that I think we will see adjusted over the next few years, one of which is the whole 5 year you're out of the woods theory, and that mammos should start at 35 instead of 40. I also agree with whoever above talked about BRCA 3 and 4 genes...and with the new statistics, I hope we see new drugs, and ACTUAL research being done for all of you guys with mets. It makes my blood boil to hear this early detection bullshit, and no where near enough money going to research advanced disease.",

I feel like reconstruction isn't always fully explained to most patients.  In a perfect world, you'd see a breast surgeon, that would instruct you to immediately consult with a PS, and tell you all of your options.  But that's almost never the way it goes.  Also, when you meet that surgeon, how do you even know what to ask? We had this discussion a little while back, and it prompted us to write the What do I ask my doctor section of our site, and make a printable version for women to take to consults with a PS. I think being informed carries over into all aspects of our treatment.  I mean, how many of us, learned more about chemo side effects from the girls here, rather than from our oncologists?",

For me, it wasn't so much as statistics for not getting a recurrence by having a prophylactic mastectomy- I fully understood that I could still get cancer back in my nodes or elsewhere in my body. It was the statistics of having a recurrence b/c of my age at diagnosis (26). So after chemo I opted for bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction.  Almost four years later, and I know it was the best decision.  My oncologist still checks my breasts when I see her twice a year, and my breasts match, and have great symmetry. While I know if I choose to have babies I won't be able to breast feed, it seems like a fair compromise for me. I think you need to go with your gut on this one.",

August 31st of this year, I will celebrate 5 years since being diagnosed with cancer when I was 26 years old. So much went through my mind- like how I would feel about losing my breasts, and my hair. How I would feel if I lost my boyfriend, my job... how would I pay the bills, how would I put my life back together... and probably all the stuff thats going through your mind and more that I didn't write. I can tell you there were lots of ups and downs in the beginning- information overload, trying to make a ton of decisions in a short amount of time- but mostly, knowing that no matter how scared it may feel- you're going through this, you have to fight this, and the truth is-- you will beat it too. Some of my fears were realized.... Getting new breasts and being bald was actually more of an internal growing experience then a devastating tragedy, I was dumped, and almost went broke, and definitely had a few brushes with being pretty sick.... but you know what? Time passed, and I got better. I beat cancer, met the man of my dreams, a new career, paid of my debt, and went on with my life. My new hair is longer then ever, and healthier then ever! And I may have scars on my breasts, and they don't work like the old ones- but I love them all the same-- and sometimes more. So I know you're just starting out- and it's going to be a long, bumpy ride-- so just hang in there sister. Time flies, even when you're not having fun. And I know in a few years, you'll be sitting where I am, writing this same msg to someone else. PM me if you need any advice and support. Know that protocols in the US and UK differ, so sometimes if you hear people doing different treatments- you may want to see where they are from- and that could tell you why.... All you have to do is wake up every day-- and just do the best you can with what you've got. Welcome to the club that no one wants to join-- but once you're in-- you've got sisters that will have your back for a very long time to come. xoxoxo",

The chemo protocol in UK is usually different then in the US... please note, that one protocol called CMF, is really toxic to your reproductive system, so that's not the one for you.... Usually FEC is common in the UK-- whereas in the US AC followed by T is more widely used. www.fertilehope.org can shed some light on the fertility thing. Basically, the ONLY good thing about getting cancer at 26, is that even if chemo shuts down your ovaries, and puts you into chemical menopause, when it's over, the likelihood that your period will come back, and you will be fertile is very high.... whereas, if you were 36, and wanted kids-- its more likely the chemo may push you into early menopause.... Your first shot is your best shot to kick some cancer ass-- so be aggressive, and kick butt- and then you'll go on to have babies when the time is right.

BUT, if rads are skippable with a mast, that might weigh in your decision making. Also, you have to think about what you will be comfortable with later on down the road.  Your age, your life expectancy, how you handle BSE's and the bi-yearly follow up mammo's and Ultra sounds... For example, if your the worry type, and at any little lump or bump you would go into freak out mode, (which is totally normal by the way) then maybe mastectomy is an options for you. If you love your breast, and want to conserve it, then lumpectomy chemo rads could be for you too. I started with a lumpectomy first.  Then I did chemo, which gave me PLENTY of time to research and figure out what was best for me in the long run.  I then opted for bilateral masts with immediate reconstruction, got to skip radiation, and went on to a year of herceptin. The decision doesn't have to be made now-- you can always wait till after chemo.",

Definitely call your surgeon. Worst case scenario, he snips the stitch, and pulls the drain at 60 cc's... you may have to get aspirated for a week or two.

Kathy, you've been through a hell of a lot, and I'm so glad your fipples have helped you take the next steps to restoring your body image. I often talk about how great I think my breasts are, but that's because I had reconstruction over 2and a half years ago.  Before I had nipples, you couldn't get me to take my shirt off. period. I was so afraid that if anyone saw me they would forever have that image emblazoned in their mind. For me, finishing reconstruction was helpful for boosting my body image.  So was getting hair, and eyelashes, and brows, and all the other good things that come with finishing treatment. I still struggle with body image b/c I have gained so much weight.  But I make sure that my own concerns don't stop me from living a full life.  I focus on the good, and I don't kick myself over the opportunity areas.  I'm a work in progress... we all are.

      "Content": "BethNY wrote: This past weekend BreastReconstruction.org exhibited at the YSC/LBBC conference, which this year was backed by Komen too.  Throughout the course of the weekend, I was approached by at least a dozen ladies with mets, that wanted reconstruction. Their stories all varied.  Some had oncs that were not on board, while others couldn't find a PS to get on board.  Some women weren't candidates as they could not stop chemo long enough, while others had a 12 week break, and stable mets, and still no hope for reconstruction. After hearing so many stories, we decided to write a section called Reconstructing the Metastatic Patient.  We are consulting with oncologists and surgeons as we write this section, but in my opinion, it's truly important to hear the voice of the patient. If any of you have thoughts on this topic, I would love to hear what you have to say.  One woman I met was 36, and her oncologist said she should take an antidepressant, and live without a breast...and I just can't help but feel that something's not right with that. I know there are so many different scenarios- and if you're dx with stage 4 from the start, that changes things too... so any comments and feedback on this subject, plus any experiences you want to share are more than welcome.

Your healthy breast should be screened every 6 months to a yr depending on your surgeon and your risks. The breast you had removed by mastectomy, and then reconstructed with an implant ONLY needs to have an MRI once every 2-3 yrs if you're having a silicone implant to screen for a very low risk of a silent leak. Otherwise, the only screening the reconstructed breast will have is by hand-- by your oncologist, your breast surgeon, even your GYN... which is why you should spread out all of these appts over time. The risk to get cacner again in that reconstructed breast is about 2% for the remainder of your life. In the case of a recurrance in the reconstructed breast, more often then not, the occurence is found on the scar line of the mastectomy. So keep up with healthy breast screenings via mammo, U/S, obviously you can't do an MRI with one expander in... for some reason I thought you did both... I hope that helps.",

What's done is done, so lets focus on going forward from here.  If you are uncomfortable with the nipple, you can always have it removed later.  If the tumor location was not near the nipple, and had a small invasive component, the likelihood that cancer can return in the nipple is very small-- something like 1-2% after mastectomy. Did you have your lymph nodes tested?  Are you scheduled to meet with an oncologist soon?",
