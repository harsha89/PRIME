I schedule an appointment which was schedule a month after I found a lump...December. My OB/GYN did indeed felt a lump and she said I needed to set an appointment for a mammogram and a sonogram, my appointment was set for the beginning of February. I went to the appointment, was questioned on why I waited so long to set the appointment. Test should that I had not one, but two lumps on my left breast. . As you can mamngine I went crazy!  They told me that I have to go do a biopsy ASAP. I called the next day to set an appointment. First questioned they asked was if I had insurance, no I don't. I was told that before I do my biopsy, I have to speak to a finacial advisor. My appointment  was set for March 16. I recieved a phone call from my doctor and she said it may be breast cancer, but  the biopsy would determin that. Do you think because I have no insurance that they pushed my appointment so far behind or because I'm young. HELP! I need answers! Log in to post a reply",
