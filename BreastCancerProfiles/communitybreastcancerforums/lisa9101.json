Right now the only thing that is a little uncomfortable is the nipple area, but it is not overbearing. I have some redness starting under the armpit. I have continued to work through all the treatments, and there are some days that I am overly tired, but I just go to bed earlier. I am now worried about starting the tamoxifen, does anyone have any input on the pro and cons? I do smoke....(I know bad habit) my oncologist said that the percentage difference for people who  did radiation and tamoxifen verses the people who did radiation alone, is not the much difference. He recommended we just try  it for a month and see how it affects me. ",

When I got home they called and said he would like for me to have an ultrasound done on the soft tissue of my neck because my lymph nodes are enlarged. Has anyone had this issue???
