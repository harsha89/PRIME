Personally after having both a mammogram and ultrasound done, I'd prefer the ultrasound.  I was actually able to view the screen while my dr. was scanning. I'm surprised the doctor didn't do more examining based on your mothers history. I would push it if I were you. I think it would be best for your own peace of mind. Wishing you all the best. Jen",
