    "Content": "donnajean wrote: I had a mastectomy of my left breast 5 weeks ago on August 20th 2014, When I first came out of surgery and for the first couple of weeks my chest was flat with a bandage across where the stitches were. I had come home with 2 draining tubes but they were taken out 14 days after the surgery. I also had lymph nodes removed which came back cancer free as well as the outside of the tumor . However on the left side where  my breast had been  and above the breast line I have been experiencing a lot of pain and swelling. I guess this is normal as the body  is trying to heal where the lymph nodes were taken out. My main concern is that my breast is so swollen it looks like it has grown back. I know this isn't what's happening but am concerned about whether this is normal or not and worried that it may no go back to normal on its own. I tried to call the surgeon today but she is away for another week Just wondering if this is normal . I was thinking it may be a build up of fluid and am hoping the body will absorb it on it's own, as I am not up to any more surgery at this time Log in to post a reply",
