THEN I asked my doctor about it and she said was possibility. I didn't lose all my hair during chemo (Taxotere, carboplatin, Pejeta and Herceptin) which also concerned me (I'm told it is a silly concern but I wondered if not killing all hair than maybe not killing all the cancer cells) but I shaved it completely bald because the hair that was left hurt and looked awful. I had no idea there was a chance it may not come back. So far so good One of my bosses said that the company warned about this in Europe long ago but never in the US until 2016. Wtf",
