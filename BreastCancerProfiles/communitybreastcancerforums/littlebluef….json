First, shaving can take off skin cells, and during radiation you want to hang on to every one for as long as you can, because radiation causes skin break down. Second, the skin of an armpit can be numb after axillary lymph node dissection. Radiation can slow healing, so an unnoticed razor nick could be a problem. Third, as radiation goes on, the skin becomes very rough and sore. Also, the hair stops growing and falls out. All that said, my RO said I could shave if I was careful, but my armpit is way to sore to even think about it. HopE this helps!",

By that I mean, marrow bone broth, bread dipped in olive oil, and a spoon of coconut oil every day. I'm having trouble eating and keeping weight on I've been so sick, so I'm hoping this will hwlp.",

I'm wondering why they even give us taxol at all then? It also said most of the side effects are from the solvent used in paclitaxel, not from the taxol itself. I know they both come from yew trees... then I got to thinking,apparently the way to cure cancer is to first turn us into sweaty bald fat boobless men, then to inject us with tree sap.

If it's caused by post nasal drip from the chemo flu, and not infected, that's what my MO recommended. Again, though, definitely call them! Well, other than feeling like I have been beaten by a gang of tiny elves from the inside out and left for dead, not feeling too chemonasty on this, the 6th day since my last dosing. Low grade nausea and fatigue. Trying to avoid crowds for the next few days until my WBC counts start to rebound. Hiked up the trail behind my house..more tired and achy than usual, but I expect it's normal for this time in the cycle. Hope everyone is feeling OK this evening!

I had to wrap my head in a heating pad which helped, and my MO said tylenol and mucinex..for me it has to do with the fact I mostly sleep on my left side, so that's where all the mucous drains and irritates and makes my throat swell.

Don't know if any of you lovley ladies are forgoing recon, but if so, the styles right now seem to flatter the boobless. I found a lot of drapey layered tops with high necklines that look pretty good. Most of them are sleeveless, which I'm not sure of, but I think I can layer a tissue weight long sleeve shirt under, or a cardigan over. I even got a couple of snuggish ones in busy patterns...figure everyone knows I had my boobs off, and no one cares. Trying to force myself to accept the body I have now. We shall see...",

Hope your side effects continue to be minimal, and those blueberries continue to be delicious...I can't wait for blueberry season up here. Last year my Mom picked 35 lbs. at a U-pick farm.. Princess, I get a taxol rash on my forearms and hands, mostly the first and second knuckle. Also, my face swells up and gets flushed, but I think that may be the 'roids..I get it the day after infusion, and it last for a few days. Benedryl helps. Rpayton, radical self care sometimes means laying on the couch. Its such a hard concept for me to grasp, but it is what it is, and its what our poor war torn bodies need now! Good for you for taking care of yourself now! Gingeel, I hear you on the Taxol pain. Are you doing dose dense? I feel like I got run over by about 10 horses...and it seems to settle in old injuries and piss them off again..but whatever, anything is better than AC! Lynne, my feet have been bugging me with blisters and pain all through this. Have you tried toe socks? They keep your toes separated and seem to help with the raw feeling. Injiji makes good ones..they are all I can wear now. I can't stand to wear regular shoes with socks at all, my feet just tear themselves up. On taxol, I also have the raw throat. Steroids on infusion day help for like 24 hrs, then its back, along with post nasal drip, body pain, and mucous membrane swelling like ears and nose. Basically, the flu without fever. But I get hot flashes, which are awesome!!!!!!!! Ginger, You still hanging in there lady? Sheshe, want us to go hold a sit-in at your path lab? I will totally come and park myself bald and boobless on someones desk if it will help! Praying for good results! Sunshine100, you gotta call your MO about your symptoms. As everyone here will tell you, they are there to help, and its also their job. Don't let it go, you don't need any stress in your life right now! As far as Taxol goes, the first few days after infusion it feels like my legs have a hard time completingmuscle movements, if that makes sense. It goes away the further out I get. Sometimes I get random pains and smashed feelings in my fingers, and my finger and toe nails are turning black. Please call your MO today! We are all hear for ya!  Well, I think I brought on the post Taxol steroid crash a few days early by going for a jog the day after infusion. Don't know if that's good or bad, but I sure felt like crap yesterday! Body pain, sore throat, emotional...the usual. Little better today, which is good, because I had my first eval by a Physical Therapist. She measured me for lymphedema and is recommending sleeves and gauntlets prophetically, since I have cording and pain already. She also gave me some exercises to start doing, hopefully get me in shape before radiation starts. She said it might have to do with the amount of blood and swelling I had during my post-surgical bleedout, rather than the surgery itself. Apparently my scars look really good. So, I seriously recommend to you ladies who have not visited a lymphedema specialist PT, give it a try. Its going to help recovery so much! And now, I am having weird emotions surrounding the end of chemo and starting this next phase. I feel like there is going to be a lot of fear and readjustment, when my body isn't feeling so sick. Kinda weird...the better I feel physically, the worse I feel emotionally. Its scary too, because my MO told me he is currently treating 11 women in their 20s and 30s for breast cancer here..",

You look like someone who has just run a marathon and is fighting to rebuild her system every two weeks. You don't look tired. You look triumphant. Or..I wish someone would say that to me LOL!

You guys, I'm having a hard time keeping my pecked up, as Andrea says..threw my low back out and am afraid to take flexeril or go to the chiropractor without talking to MO, who is closed now, of course. It's really stressing me out, because back spasms have put me in the ER paralyzed from the waist down before. It's jacking up my whole bad cancer side. I see adds for anti aging makeup and stuff on TV and it makes me so depressed worrying about dying from cancer..and my eyelashes and brows are jumping ship. What a pity party huh? Sorry for the whine...",

Keep posting those round 4 symptoms please....I know it's different for everyone, but it sure helps to know what to look for! Hope u feel better soon and Taxol is kind to us all... So I love the idea of getting to know each other outside of tumor land! Here goes... Born and raised in Montana and the west. My husband and I met in college, when I showed up to class a month late and sat next to him. At my school, during bad fire seasons, they would allow students who were wild land firefighters and were on assignment when school started to show up late without penalty. I had been on a fire in California. We were both dirty and feral lol. After I got my masters in Archeology and he got his BA, we worked in Colorado for a while. I worked for Mesa Verde NP as an archeologist. He is a career helicopter based firefighter. We moved to Alaska for 3 years and had a blast in the rain forest. Then we moved back to Montana, and I worked for Glacier NP for 5 yeqrs while he ran a hel itack program in central MT. Glacier was amazing! I'm totally serious about taking whoever wants to go hiking there next summer! Now I work for the Forest Service as an archeologist and get to live with my husband! I love my job so much! We don't have kids yet, but are hoping to adopt once my treatment is over. We have two cat children and hope to get a dog soon. I've been doing a lot of work for FEMA lately, which I also love. I've worked on Hurricane Sandy and the MC 252 oil spill in the Gulf, most recently. In my real life, I love to trail run, garden, work out, cross country ski, and snowboard. I'm a county search and rescue volunteer and occasionally work as a fire dispatcher. Fitness is very important to me because when I go out on fires, I have to be able to hang with 18 yr old boys. Now I also love to embroider and crochet, and obsessively check this site. Guess that's about it for me....who's next?😊",

Ok ladies, time to think about our Glacier NP for next summer! I don't need firm commitments, buT here is what I'm thinking. One big day hike, maybe shangri la basin or the Dawson Pitamakin loop. I can reserve a group camp site over on the east side, and there are numerous other lodging options..a beautiful historic hotel, several less historic motels outside the park but very close. You can fly into Kalispell, and rent a car, take Amtrak to East Glacier, or drive. I'm figuring a week or so all told? Maybe 3 nights? If you don't want to hike, there is Going to the Sun road over Logan pass, visiting the histoic lodges, boat tours, fishing...we can grill dinner or eat out, Two Sisters or the Luna cafe are awesome! Of course, drinks at the lodge one night..virgin or otherwise! Any thoughts?",

Well, go fitted for a lymphedema sleeve and glove today at PT, and learned some manual drainage techniques. That stuff seems like magic..I'm not used to any therapy working unless it hurts LOL. I don't have lymphedema and I want to keep it that way! On the plus side, my PT said that the cording and scar tissue has reduced even since Monday! Those freaky scar nodules that sent me to the MO are smoothing out, and I've started to regain range of motion in my shoulders. Hope everyone is having a good day!

Let's all look eachother in the eye right now and know, really know, that we are cancer free and will remain so. No guessing, no hope, no faith, no positive thinking. Just know. We got this! They wouldn't put us through hell for nothing! Same goes for all my sisters here. I'm so excited to see everyone moving on to new phases in life and treatment! Can't even believe we got this far when I look back two months ago. It's so great to learn from each others experiences and know we are not alone in this weird plce. It is so good to see everyone lending a hand and leading eachother through toward the light. As for me, at this time every cycle I'm questioning my will to go forward. Nausea and mouth sores are hitting hard and fast, and blood counts might be down (they don't check) making me depressed and weak. May take part of tomorrow off from work tomorrow and sulk. Or go for a jog. But what the heck, I'm alive and suffering from chemo, not cancer, so every day is one more putting that monster in the Ground for good! Yarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! (Pirate battle cry)",

I don't know about starting then stopping treatment, but after surgery, I had to wait 4 weeks due to complications to start chemo. I was freaking out, and my MO said there is about a 3 month window to start chemo. Don't know anything further than that, but it seems like you are well within that window...definitely worth asking!

And what a beautiful sign and fiber art piece! Eyebrows- I never noticed how much sweat I produce until they fell out- now sweat just beads up where they used to be. I actually got pissed at the 15 long snaggly hairs that were left and shaved them off, so now I look like a jackass who shaved their eyebrows, not a cancer patient. Nope, not true. I still look like a cancer patient. Kbeee- Ok, where's the picture of your dancing slipper??? Did you bedazzle it? Lady, you do what your Ortho says, ya'hear? Loving the hair pics from those who have posted them! Keep'em coming! Anyone know anything about adoption post-cancer? Ok, so this is Day....8 PFC. Energy is up and down- early in the week I was my obnoxiously bouncy self, I think because I finally asked them to cut down my steroids. Yesterday was kind of a crash day- producing lots of mucous, scratchy throat, swollen eyes, mild nausea. Went out in the field, and got pretty carsick because my lunatic friend (Mr. I always go 10 over) was driving. Rallied after work and jogged 5 miles. Slept poorly last night due to hot flashes and cats (aka the critters I am raising up to make slippers out of LOL. Lil darlings :\\) Woke up this morning with muscle pain in my lower back, neck, and left foot (where I broke it last October.) Still pretty congested, mildly groggy, mildly nauseous, sore fingernails, stiff armpits and little surgical pains. Soooo..pretty standard first week after chemo. Radiation will start for me in Mid-August. I need to call them at the end of the month and set up my first appointment, if they forget to call me. They are planning to cook all of my left side watershed, it sounds like. After 1 appointment, I love my radiology team. The RO runs the same ultramarathons that my brother does. So, practically family. They are down with patching me up so I can exercise as much as I can stand. I told them I would be that idiot who pushes it to the limit- just being honest. Which makes me happy, after reading that radiation study on here that says extra rads for early stage cancer produces a significant drop in reoccurrence. Which I'm all about. Even though it was for women who had a lumpectomy, not a mastectomy. Another interesting study that Sas-Shatzi posted on the port removal thread is regarding a lower chance of reoccurrence in women who took NSAIDS post surgery. Maybe worth reading up if ya'all haven't had surgery yet? It was interesting to me because I was accidentally prescribed giant doses of ibuprofen post-surgery. It almost killed me but...hidden benefit?? Pretty to think so, and I'll take any ray of hope! Port incision looks ok- have to keep it covered because the cats like to give me cat scans all night by running up on my chest and feeling for lumps. I air it out when I can and dab it with peroxide. It doesn't hurt at all except for a tiny twinge now and then, but it looks like some mad scientist went after my heart, but got the wrong side and sewed it up. Kind of crashing because my friend (Mr. I always go 10 over) finally told me his sister died 4 years ago from breast cancer, and that's why he has been avoiding me through all this. First- Wham, sympathy for his family. So, So sad. Second- Wham, fear. Cold, hard, gut clenching fear for us all. Third, and unexpected- Wham. Survivor guilt. Its always a dang roller coaster in my head. Its also hard, because my friend's mom was diagnosed as stage 4 about the same time as I was diagnosed as stage 1. I want to support her in any way I can, but I don't want to be presumptuous. Fear and survivor guilt. Survivor guilt and Fear and social awkwardness. At this point, I'd be happy just for a blah, no ups and downs day in my brain. I'm scared of cancer, but I want cancer to be more scared of me.  Sorry for the long meandering post! Its nice to have a real keyboard rather than my tablet to type on! Wishing everyone the best this Friday- For real, I'm praying for us all, as long as you don't mind that I'm not totally a Christian. xoxooxox",

D was low, and I'm in the sun a lot, so its probably a good thing to get checked. I see my MO again in 2 months, but I'll be doing radiation for most of that. Other than that, I don't think there will be much followup other than 2-3 month check ups. Its pretty much up to me to feel myself up.",

Its pain in the exact same spots as it always hurt before cancer, its just lasting longer. Wondering if Chemo made our tendons and such extra stiff and inflamed? I even told myself to map it, because eventually my crazy mind would get around to thinking \"mets\". And, last night, it finally did get around to thinking that, and I couldn't shake it, to the point of bringing on a panic attack. I was even working with a PT before radiation started, on the exact same issue. And that was during chemo. And I will be going back. That side has always been messed up since a horse fell on my when I was 17. I know all this, but I'm documenting it here to talk myself down. Addie, I have always had a bad back too. Ok, thanks for the hand up out of the hole. I'm going to be re-reading your posts as my life-line a bunch today I think! You guys are absolutely the best!",

But, I didn't do recon, so that would probably lead to a longer relationship. Bladder issues: It feels like I have lost feeling in my bladder or something. So when I have to go..I have to go RIGHT NOW. No slow warning buildup. Neuropathy: Smashed feeling in a few of my fingers even 3 weeks out. and the tops of my toes itch. Don't know if its neuropathy, but its been going on since mid taxol. Super annoying. Sad day- I think I've developed an allergy to coconut oil. I am on my 3rd jar since chemo, and its making me itch. Grrf. Anyone else have a good non-toxic all natural cruelty free non-carcinogenic option? Also coral reef safe and preferably edible and retained in post consumer recycled container?

That's total bullshit, and I think the person who didn't show deserves a junk punch. Hiiiiiiii ya!

Weird thingnis, with wig, makeup, eyelashes and brows and sexy clothes, we all look hot. It just feels so fake right now, to me. Lynne, it looks like you are having a beautiful vacation with your family. Sorry your losing toe nails, that sounds painful. What do you think is causing it? Injury? Chemo? Both? Have you tried toe sox? They help my feet because then my toes don't rub together in my shoes.. it sounds like you are comming on some decisions regarding your DH. We are totally hear for you if you need us! If I forgot anyone, I'm sending good energy to you all for a peaceful nights sleep. We all survived today. We will survive tomorrow too.

Ok, so I totally did the bad thing today at Rads, but only in my head. I saw a lady walking down the hall bald and was all \"Damn, she looks good, and isn't it sweet of her to shave her head in solidarity with someone.\" Luckily I didn't say that out loud! I'm still not totally sure she was a patient and not a caregiver LOL. Also, got a shout out at the grocery store from a lady who completely thought I just shaved my head because I didn't like my hair, and was going on and on about wishing she was brave enough to shave all hers off because it was straight and she hated it. I just went with it and encouraged her to brave the shave. I'm like a bald social ninja lol. OK, new rant. Without hair, what do you use to floss your teeth with in an emergency?? Come on, we've all done it. On the topic of Rads, my tech told me I could shave my pits- I didn't even ask. They must be pretty hairy LOL. Guess its time to buy razors....",

Well, on this, the Friday before my last two whole chest radiations, which precede 5 boosts to my scar (but who is counting??) I have learned a few things. First, when I'm scared/stressed out I do stupid stuff like drink water out of a cattle trough, thus giving myself the galloping trots for the next 3 days. Uh huh- that will help stave off dehydration. Duh. Also, Oncologists hand out psych meds like M&Ms, but never really address the fact that they are damn addictive, at least mentally. I have a HUGE ativan habit now. I'm throwing it out there because I'm trying to break it. by smoking pot. (shrug) And one of my co-workers, who is very very bald- is sad my hair is growing back. I'm not his bald sister anymore. Oh well. Sad face. Also, does anyone else not sleep past 4 am anymore? Yeesh. Its awful. They aren't hot flashes, ladies. They are stress flashes! Anyway, its Friday! So we got that going for us!!!! I'm gonna go see if I can con a ride in my friendly neighborhood cop's new mustang. (midlife crisis car). Its good to have goals, right???",

I did get a little peace of mind from my surgeon- mostly along the lines of \" well, when I had cancer, he knew right away, so if he thinks its 95% scar tissue/sutures/granuloma/ then he's probably right.\". So, I am doing my best to let it go until my next appointment. Lynne, on Rads- I never heard corn starch- just lotion, lotion, lotion. I'm a little over half way, and my hide is holding up, for what its worth. Also, I am in the same dark place as you, I think. I'm going to meet with my Onc. here in a week or so to talk antidepressants, and start seeing my therapist again. Seems pretty normal. Addie-LMFAO the BloodHound Gang. YES! I think my DH still has one of their CDs rolling around in his truck somewhere. Good stuff. Bet you never thought you'd be getting so many requests from women on the internet to see the girls LOL!

Maybe sing pirate songs in the bathtub while doing so. (You know I'm just kidding, right?) Although I've done it, pre-cancer... Kbeee- I like your style. I bet Tamoxifen will burn great, especially with just a dab of gasoline on it. I am trying to plan a burning party, which will probably include playing chicken with the cops and the VFD, what with fire restrictions and all. My brother has purchased illegal fireworks and exploding targets. Why this is a bad idea: We are all over 30, I work both for the Fed and in law enforcement and fire, and its really irresponsible. Why this is a great idea: FU cancer! Which is what I yell every time I accomplish a new fitness goal. Finally harassed my RO into calling me back. After talking me down, he said the radiation window for effectiveness is 3 months from last chemo. Buuuut...I get my sim next Monday. You know I will be blasting \"Light'em up\" the whole way there.. Ok, my brain only extends to one page of replys- stupid site won't let me scroll back when the reply window is open. Hope everyone is doing good and counting down today! ",

But.....women who have had breast cancer have a 50% chance of developing melanoma, so I'm doing ever 6 month skin checks indefinitely. Also, no moldy spots at this time!!! Yay!!!!! She also said skin cancer loooooves to show up in scars, so pay special attention to them- ugh. And now we know. And now I have a Gyno appointment next Wednesday to freak out about. I sure wish there were other options than Planned Parenthood around here. Not that they aren't awesome, and I'm sure they see a ton of cancers. What's annoying, is there is only one preferred provider for my insurance around here, and he's booked out 6 months. And, I have no interest in seeing a male gyno. The thought makes my skin crawl. So, Planned Parenthood it is! fingers crossed i have no reproductive cancers. Actually kind of whiped out today after Rads- I think its psychosomatic though. That and stress.",

I know the standard American diet is full of nasties, but there are so many standard Americans out there who don't have cancer. I was super health conscious, and here I am. With the worst kind of breast cancer. Seriously, for some reason its getting to me today. I hate every food I eat right now. I want my god damn veggies, fruits, and artisanal cheeses. Ok, just reading at that makes me laugh. I'm such a whiner. Can I have one more dose of good sense, please, and then I'll shut up? No rain in the long range forcast. I can't even see 5 blocks from here. My DH just I A'd a new fire, and he's having a melt down (inside) too because they almost got burned over on the last fire they were on yesterday. Yup, that happens and its part of the job, but for some reason we are both a little raw and not bouncing back like we used to emotionally. Doesn't help that we haven't seen each other in over a month. So, in liu of worrying about him, and his dangerous job, which could be made more dangerous by an upset mental state, and me and my suck ass probably deadly in the nastiest way cancer, I'm complaining about vegetables.

Another weird thing-I have been having neck, jaw joint, and armpit tightness and pain. My MO did an ultrasound and said it's just tight muscles and cording. Well, woke up today with no pain from cording! Guess all it took was a grease injection!

Now, it hurts in exactly the same way it hurt befor cancer, kind of a constant pain relieved by excercise...more of a tight tendon feeling in the groin and a knot where the bones twist in my sacrum. It's been going on since basically the end of chemo when I started exercising hard. Chiropractic helps, but he yanked my leg two weeks ago and agvrated the groin tendon. Standing helps, sitting hurts. Lately since I started rads I'm fatigued quite a bit. You know where this is going right? Wondering if the beast somehow avoided all traps set for it and moved into my hip area. Of course, since I'm an emotional cutter, I've been reading all the worst case scenario info on here and I think k tonight I finally drove myself around the bend. Doesn't help I feel a bit like I'm getting a cold. So now I sitting here wondering if any of this was worth it. You know, to the point of wondering if I've stockpiled enough ambien and pain pills, if and when it comes to that. Because I'll be damned if I let my family watch me die horribly while they suffer. Sorry. I guess what I'm looking for is either a pat on the head or a kick in the ass.",

It went really well, I am trying not to Get too excited yet. She went over all my options, including flap and BRAVA, and which ones she did and which she would refer me out for. What she prefers is two rounds of fat grafting and then TE placement, then exchange. She is a member of all pertinent professional organizations and is from Montana, and wants to be close to family. So I'm feeling cautiously positive. I'll meet with guy number 2 next week... Edited to add-ok so you want to move fat from my belly and saddle bags to my chest? Ummmm....yes please lol. Maybe the silver lining is finally becoming visible? Cautiously hopeful?",

I want to have children and outlive my parents. And, that fear is natural and appropriate, and needs to be faced, And, dissociation from our bodies is a healthy defense mechanism at times like this. But, when the fear is recognized, it is possible to re engage the higher functions of the mind. Our bodies are not the enemy. Cancer is the enemy. Cancer is what we fear and face. Cancer has a name. Names have power. My Doctor says the cancer that I had is gone, removed by surgery. With the power of the name, comes knowledge. All of medical science is intending to CURE us with these brutal, barbaric poisons and surgery. We can now fight with tools. I am angry. Sometimes is a berserker rage, like what got me through surgery. Rage is energy. Rage is fire. Rage is natural, and must be faced. Rage can not be sustained. My rage is NOT the rage of the powerless. I have power over this disease. Like a coyote in a trap, rage let me cut my boobs off without a second thought to save my life. When I face my rage and fear, It isn't comfortable. It hurts. I cry. And then I realize these basic emotions led me to all these tools to fight cancer. medical science, which intends to CURE us. Billions of dollars, hundreds of years. Complimentary medicine. Yep, my MO is all for MJ, and it works so well! Radical self care right now, to learn to know and love our new bodies. constant vigilance, against a known and familiar enemy. From you ladies with reoccurance, I have learned that this will save your life. Thank you. my friends, my family, my work family, volunteers, you guys..all of us praying together and supporting eachother. we are never ever alone, even in the depths of fear and rage and sickness. Never. There is always someone who values your life,and is doing everything in their power to heal you. Let that in. This is one time when going your own way isn't best. Follow group oppinion and GET BETTER forever. It would be rude not to! I am praying for all of us. Right now.",

At diagnosis, I found out I had cancer on a Friday and boobs off next Monday, so no time to think. If there is a good option available. That works with my work schedule and life style, and a surgeon I like, then I may consider it. My husband and I had a talk last night about why he is such a dipweasle- seems like a lot is guilt for abandoning me during treatment. And he doesn't feel sexy. Um....I'm the one that looks the world in the eye and spits, remember? Whatever. Upshot is- operation NOOBS is his baby to research and I.element and take ownership. This should be interesting. Because I could go either way. The only thing about not having breasts that bugs me is sexually....and that's not that important. Otherwise, flat is fine. But maybe having noobs would help everyone who helped heal me move on? In which case, to see my parents less scared- I'd do it in a heart beat. We shall see.",

Here is what I learned at my sim- I've seen scarier machines comming at me in the dentist's office. No big deal. CT didn't use contrast- I know I was wondering about that. They gave me 3 freckle sized tatoos. again, no big deal. I tried to convince them to start work on my sleeve, but they wouldn't go for it LOL. I asked about using lotion before getting microwaved- RO said the deal is, that radiation is like a bowling ball through a field of pins. It may not hit any in the first line, but eventually, it will hit some. Lotions just add another line of defense against that bowing ball. Not a huge deal, he said, but I'm gonna go with what I learned here, which is no lotion 2 hrs before. I will be getting fried at 8 am sharp starting next Monday. It sounds like they are going to see if holding my breath helped the heart situation at all- they took CTs with and without. I am covered in stickers right now, but I can peel them off. I will be getting a bolus every time- explained as a way to trick the radiation into staying on my skin rather than going deeper. RO said the first two weeks will be fine, then we will see how my skin is holding up- they may ease off on the bolus. I asked him about using Bodyglide to protect my skin- he said he'd look into it, but he'd never heard of anyone using it. I'm thinking of applying it to my armpit to reduce friction while excercising. He's a runner, so he's down with that. He also said he'd help me train for an ultra in January. So yep- what I know. What has anyonwe else learned?",

No coffee, no green tea, low on the fruits and veggies- I'm basically afraid to eat or drink anything that isn't meat or bread (neither of which I particularly enjoy). Its making me crazy. My RO said to eat normally, but normally for me is basically organic vegetarian, and that gave me cancer! So, I've gone from a super healthy, excercise 3 hrs a day, non-smoking vegetarian, to a slug who eats fast food- just because I don't want to do anthing to f*c$ up my chances with treatment.

I showed up in flip flops last time and they had to wrap my feet in surgeon's hats LOL...someone had sewed mittens for patients to wear under the gloves out of t-shirt material. As far as occurrence, I think all of us right now in treatment have less chance of getting cancer than the rest of the normal population, if that makes sense. It isn't going to grow while we are on chemo, my MO said. So, deep breath, we don't have to worry about it during treatment! When people ask if I'm in remission, that's what I tell them. I have less chance of getting cancer right now today than you do. Maybe I don't totally understand the medical use of the term remission, because to me it implies an impermanent abnormal state. If everyone has the potential to develop cancer, than isn't everyone in remission, or premission, or something? Or, conversely, if medical science returns us to a physical state in which no cancer is detectable, haven't those of us who completed treatment been returned to normal? Jeeze, I think that meeting I just got out of fried my brain, but I really am curious. Can someone with medical knowledge weigh in?",

The hormones made me 100% miserable..exhausted, body aches, bad skin, bloating, migrains, constipation, you name it. There were days I just wanted to stay in bed and cry. BUT..most days I could push through and at least get some housework done. Does this sound in any way comparable to the chemo experience? Again , I'm so sorry if this is in bad taste, I'm just scared and trying to prepare. Thanks for your understanding!",

Kbeee- I laughed when I saw your picture- your chest looks identical to mine down to the port scar. Fatigue seemed to lift this week, and no breaks in my skin yet, although my armpit is really dark/black. Getting a little more sore, swollen, with little pinpoint dot rash. I get a bolus every time, and you can definitely tell where it lays- my supraclavicular area isn't near as rough looking. Mostly using the lotion my RO gave me, with emu oil and burts bees- although it was too cold in my house for the Emu oil to come out yesterday, so I stuck with cetaphil. Next Monday, I'm getting a little surgery on my prophylactic side- found a freaky lump under my scar near my sternum. Now, I think its a leftover suture, but I still want it gone, because dammit, my surgeon said he's 95% certain its not cancer and that's not good enough for me. So it will be interesting to see how having a wound so close to my radiated area will go. 10 more. just 10 more. Then a week of boosts.

I think rads are so hard because we have lost the rage and fear that got us through chemo. At least I have. The warrior spirit is tired, the war shave is growing in. Its battle fatigue. Yup. I have no rage left right now. Just fear. Which is funny, because my sister's husband is a minister, and he was talking to me right after chemo about how I will have to take time to grieve what I've lost. I was just to agro and hopped up at the time to listen. Huh. Wonder if that's what this is? Sometimes, when I haven't had enough sleep in 6 months, I like to psychoanalyze myself. So anyway..",

What do you all do to prep your systems the day before treatment? My nurses didn't really recommend anything specific except to hydrate. Last time I was radically nauseous for 9 days, zofran and compazine didn't helP much.",

What has helped is gargling with baking soda and salt like 4 times an hour. Anything to keep it from getting infected, because he said if it didn't heal it would delay treatment. It's even got my Eustace an tube swollen up. Today, it seems to be getting better. I've added gargling and drinking very diluted apple cider vinegar to the mix. Figure it works on regular sunburns, it might work on chemical burns as well. Plus it will keep thrush confused and hopefully at bay. It seems to sting at first, then sooth.

I read that the Yew tree that give us taxol is sacred to the Celts and many NW Coast Native tribes as a powerful healing plant. How did they know?? Kind of interesting. I never thought to oil the clipper blades, but that sounds like a really good idea. Maybe disinfect them as well. I wonder what kind of moisturizer is the best? I'm thinking unscented something with a bit of tea tree oil mixed in? Feels gross to have a wig on all the time at work LOL, but whatever. Good to know to wash the wig ever 14 days. I have been doing it once a week. I got wig wash, but don't like the smell. Wonder if Dr. Bronners soap would work the same? I feel like its mostly the cap part that needs to be washed. Its funny, because in real life at work, i'm such a dirt ball LOL. Not much point in shampooing if you are camping for 14 days at a time or working out 2x a day and hiking in between. Now, though, I'm the biggest germophobe!  Positive Spirit, you truly live up to your screen name, and you look beautiful! Is you hair already growing back? Steph, BIG HUGS, girl! What kind of tree do you want to be? I'm scared too. Its a shit sammich. We have to remember, though, that we are NOT numbers or statistics. When you read stats of survival for this, remember that A., the odds are in our favor of beating this by a large percentage, and B., death rates are just that. death rates. from everything, not just cancer, within the first 5 years or whatever. So yeah, a certain percentage who are being tracked die from cancer, but another percentage dies of something else, like getting hit by that damn bus that everyone says is coming for us. Also, clearly reoccurance is not a death sentence. Witness our fearless leader, KBeee. Its an annoyance. Now all this doesn't make it ok, but after enough Ativan, it does help me sleep at night. Sorry to go all Pollyanna on you, just wanted to share some thoughts that help me sleep, like I said. KBEEEEE, I can't freakin believe you are doing a half marathon tomorrow. I know I said I'd do it with you, but It may take me a few days to complete LOL. Still pulling for ya! You are an inspiration! So, do you actually heal muscle tears from exercise faster on Taxol than on AC? Just curious if i could start ramping up a bit after being a lazy chemoslug since the 16th...just felt so crappy with this 4th one, wah wah wah. I have 30 miles of road to survey sometime this summer....last summer, it would have taken me two days. Now???? Rpayton, Good luck at the spa today! Another one bites the dust!  ",

Fluids....Nope, I don't usually go in after to get them. I did after my first AC because I was vomiting so much, and I did after my first Taxol for the same reason. I do make them run the full final bag of saline, even if the infusion drugs run out first (and they usually do). Figured, I paid for it, and it can't hurt! My blood doesn't get monitored either except the day of infusion, but so far everything has been normal..even my hemoglobin continued to improve from its all time low before my first AC.  My DH just bought me two pairs of leather pants off of Amazon, and a pair of heels. Do you guys think he is trying to tell me something??? (deadpan look)",

On the other hand, I feel like its keeping me safe...So glad you guys all get it. No one else does! This group is the best! My husband has totally checked out through the whole process. Hasn't been to one treatment, hasn't even driven me. He has managed to be gone for most of the last few months. I bet he won't go to my Radiation consult next week. Luckily, my parents are making the 3 hour drive over to be with me, and my Dad has been staying with me this week and cooking me breakfast every morning. He's so sweet.

She has me activating all my core muscles, working on upper back strength, and trying to stretch my scars. I also got a lymph sleeve and gauntlet. It seemed like a good idea, and what do ya know, wearing the sleeve feels good. the gauntlet may be too small. So anyways, throwing it out there if anyone is on the fence about PT..I was super fit before cancer, and now I'm really not, but physical therapy is going to be a great tool. She said that they used to just kick people to the curb after treatment, but now that so many women are getting treated early and surviving, they are starting to be aggressive with QOL things like PT. Yup. Surviving. Not dying of breast cancer. And they treat a LOT of young women at my hospital, unfortunatly, so she knows wheroff she speaks. It ain't no bad cold, but it ain't no death sentence either. I know we all know that, but it never hurts to reinforce it!",

I'd have to look again at my report, because as per usual, I was doped to the gills on Ativan and not really tracking. All I know is, my MO and BS said my case wasn't as dire as they had originally thought, and I was clean. They also did blood work- tumor markers and such at that time, and it all came back normal. This was all after surgery and before chemo. So who knows??? My understanding is every human has cancer cells in their body. I guess I believe them because its their job to know. And my fingers hurt too- they always do about this time. I think I'm going to lose some finger nails..",

Ksusan posted her super awesome regime on the summer rads thread a few pages back when I was freaking out. Its very comprehensive, and I'm going to adopt a good part of it, depending on how my skin reacts. Right now, before rads start, I'm using Burts Bees baby bee unscented lotion to keep my skin in good order. Once they start- I'll probably step it up. I have emu oil and a lot of people like Miaderm or Aquaphor, or natural stuff with calendula. Also, on the Summer Rads group, several of us have posted playlists to keep from freaking out. My personal go-to is Light it up by fall out boy- What's yours??? :)",

Good idea about sealing the skin- wonder if it would help with sweat? I'm worried about chafing the little dog ear on my side, which is so gross and i want the damn thing cut off, but that's a whole nother issue. Lynne! Yay for meeting Positive in real life! At least we get awesome friendships out of this... My RO didn't say anything against deodorant, lotion, anything before treatment. I think i'm gonna be careful though- no deodorant on that side. I wonder if having a tattoo on that shoulder is going to mess things up? Grrrrf. Hopefully all will be made clear on Monday. FUCANCER! I want my damn life back!!!!!! Sorry, sometimes my inner monologue gets away from me... Ok, i really must suck at eyebrows. Today some lady I have never talked to before at work tracked me down and said I looked like I needed a hug. Very sweet- but really???? I think I need to bite the bullet and go to Macys and get some help. Also, my tech keeps staring at me..She finally said its because my natural sunscreen makes me so pale she keeps checking to see if I'm about to pass out. Gahhh.

On the plus side, he seems confident he can treat any skin issue that arises, up to and including me being non-compliant on the running issue. However, I do have an appointment to look at a gym tonight- see what my options are for minimizing armpit chafing. If I can get a good workout on a stair climber, I will be ok with it.

Thinking of you!  justnwent in for my second round of fat grafting and a biopsy on a lump. The grafting was no big deal. I'll hear biopsy results at my followup. Hoping and praying for b9 results and for my PS to say I don't need any more grafting, my skin is healed enough for expanders! It does look more obvious this time on the radiated side, the skin is plumper. I expected to have new cannula scars both at the donor site and the treated site, but it looks like he went back in through the same scars, I didn't know they could do that! My donor site (stomache) is swollen a bit, but not painful yet. I'm still a little woozy, which I expect to last a few days, but not too bad!",

Most of the pain is in the muscles of my armpit and side of rib cage when stretching like breathing. RO says that;s normal. Crackling when breathing would not be normal and a sign of radiation pneumonitis. Wouldn't that be fun? My armpit is a little sore and starting to turn almost black in the part where the bolus crosses it. I think its dying hair follicles lol. The most annyoying side effect is the crackly/inflamed ear, even though they arent irradiating very far above my collar bone. I think the irritation is turning into inflation of the Eustachian tubes. Good times! I still use the steroid cream right after, and then Phytoplex throughout the day. At night, emu oil, then a few hours later, a thick layer of ctephil from the jar. We shall see....What's everyone elses routine?",

Cry as much as you need to, then draw your sword and FIGHT, girl, you can do this. Try to look at it this way. You were dying, but luckily enough you went to the Dr and didn't live in denial, and so now you are not. Now you are fighting and planning to LIVE. My advice is, you are going to break down. Plan for it. Set everything up during moments of mental clarity, so that when you are losing it, you still just have to move forward. If you trust your breast surgeon, no need to get a second opinion. Its completely up to you. I did not get a second opinion, because I completely trusted my surgeon and his reputation. Find out if your treatment center has a nurse navigator or a social worker who can help be there for you at appointments. These people are there to help guide you through this scary time. Find an Oncologist, or get referred by your surgeon or nurse navigator. Again, if you trust your Oncologist, no need for a second opinion. I did not get a second opinion, because my MO by the grace of God is one of the best in the nation. Find a therapist for you and your loved ones. The American Cancer Society has therapists on staff who will counsel you over the phone. This is a terrifying time, but you are young and healthy and you can fight this and win! you got this, girl.",

I also did lots of home made broth with lots of natural gelatin from the bones in it, and blended soups with meat veggies cheese and heavy cream. Anything to get calories and protein down. McDonald's burgers sat well also. It's mind over matter at this point. She's just gotta eat like it's her job. For me surgery wasn't that painful, but it does kill your a petite and constipated you and limit range of motion. Good news it, it's way better than chemo. Talk to a nutritionist for sure, and maybe a therapist. Trust me, she will be able to retrain herself to eat, but it takes work. I had to set an alarm to remind myself to eat every hour.Good luck!",
