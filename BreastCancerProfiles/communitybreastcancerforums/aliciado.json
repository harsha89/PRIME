A dermatologist mentioned something about they way i sleep and that maybe i am pressing the breast there. I have an appointment for US this Friday. I also noticed when pressing my breasts together that on my other (right) breast, 2 dimples appear. On that breast i have a fibroadenoma and some cysts. Could that dimpling be caused by any of these?",

I'm so sorry i'm posting here with my insignificant problem, but i was really scared.

I know because my aunt and grandmother had BC.. Anyway, these doctors didn't see the redness thoroughly. Most of them were dermatologists and all of them said they didn't know what this is (they didn't say it is \"nothing\"). How can this be reassuring? I can't believe something that gets bigger is \"nothing\".. Also where i live(Greece) and with our insurance system i can tell you that this is not a place to rely on this kind of doctors. I cannot afford a \"better\" doctor so this is why i'm worried since IBC is something uncommon and a doctor should have better experience to identify it or be alarmed to get more tests.. This is a small country and even some of these doctors weren't familiar with the term.. Btw the redness is now about 2inches",

The last doctor said my neck lymph nodes are not swollen (he examined them thoroughly but i ll check it with US too) and there is nothing wrong with my nipple. I have never had discharge or flaky skin on my nipple/areola neither it is red, painfull or flattened. Are there any other breast cancer types that include just pale redness?Would it be better if i asked for an MRI?",

Yes i have seen 2 breast surgeons(1 of them didn't know about IBC) and they told me to put some cream on it which didn't work. I don't have other breast changes although my left breast has always(since i was really young) been sensitive and hurted from times to times. Also i have some itching in both nipples rarely.. but i guess that's normal? The doctors checked(with their hands) my neck lymph nodes and didn't comment on them. Could this be a bacterial infection? Its shape is oval, not itchy, flaky or anything else and its color is pale pink. Are there any IBC cases that are left undiagnosed for so long but haven't progressed more?",

He said it might be an old bruise that has become faint and refused to test it more although he wasn't sure what it is. I asked \"why does it get bigger?\" He said \"i don't know\"..! I am starting to really worry again. He didn't even give me antibiotics. I am seeing another dermatologist tomorrow just in case. All i am thinking is what if it is something serious and i am just leaving it there for so many months..? I know that there are cancers that don't necessarily include a tumor.. Also this week it started feeling very sensitive there and i m feeling something like pinching under the skin from times to times.. What else can i do? They are not taking me seriously.. Another thing is that my neck lymph nodes feel swallen and every time i lie down or bend over to reach something (and my head goes lower) i feel them to get too much swallen.. like they are choking me.. I know it sounds weird and i have no idea if it has anything to do with that red spot..",
