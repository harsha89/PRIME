The problem started when I was on Xeloda (now on Doxil) and my hands were beginning to look like hamburger meat. A friend told me about the B6 and I was amazed. Now I've developed a rash on both arms that looks like psoriasis, particularly on the elbows. After some online research I decided to try pure, unrefined shea butter along with black soap. I just ordered both online from nasabb.com. Hope it works. I see my onc next week and I suspect he will tell me to take a couple decadron pills.",
