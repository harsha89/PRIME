First 24 hours were terrible non-stop vomiting followed by feeling extremely nauseous for another couple of days. Hospital brought me in on Friday and put me on a drip for a couple of hours to get some fluids in, and gave me a white blood cell booster injection. They also gave me some different nausea meds in case it started up again. I have lost 4kg so far and am trying to keep up the fluids. I'm utterly drained and the chemo fog is really bad. Finding it difficult to concentrate on anything. Today was the first day I managed to actually get up and do a little housework. Luckily my son (13) just got Spring break so has been surviving on instant noodles and pasta while I'm out of action. Very furry tongue and mouth but I'm starting to get used to it. Will try peaches!! Tomorrow I have to go back to the hospital for my Thyroid pathology results after the lobectomy 2 weeks ago. Amazingly it seems to be healing up well, so at least I have that to be thankful for. Hoping some of the fatigue is down to the thyroid as it's really hit me for six.",

Got to the hospital at 9am, had the blood test, then had to wait until 11am to see my doctor as it was a public holiday the following day so totally packed. Got the all clear and went up to the chemo center where they had lots of trouble finding a suitable vein, and we spent an hour trying different ones with saline. Finally found one they were happy with and got going. Took 6 hours at the hospital in all. I felt quite lightheaded coming home and because I hadn't eaten I decided to have some lunch. Big mistake. About 1 hour later the nausea and vomiting started. I went to bed feeling terrible and have stayed there ever since.Slept on and off but I feel the same this morning. I'll take the meds - hopefully I can eat something a bit later for the steroids. Phew, really wasn't expecting to feel so bad on the first day. Thank god my son is off school today to keep an eye on me. He's been fantastic. Just hope the vomiting stops as I'm only bringing up water now.",

Half of the battle is the complete exhaustion too. Is she nauseous or just finding it hard to eat and drink enough? I have started adding a little juice into the water which helps with the taste. I really find straight water very difficult to stomach. Jelly, grapes and watermelon have been good too. Any food with water content.I also drank some rehydrating electrolyte powdered drinks. I know it's difficult but sounds like you are doing an awesome job in caring for her.  ",

IDC 2cm with LCIS throughout breast, Grade 2, Strong (8/8) ER+, Strong (8/8) PR+, HER2-, 10/15 nodes, Ki67 26.5% I am going to do 4 cycles of FEC for 12 weeks then 4 cycles of Docetaxel for 12 weeks. After that, hormone and radiation therapy. I had a right mastectomy on Jan 25th with sentinel and axillary dissection. I also have a tumor in my left thyroid lobe which is being removed on March 8th (popped up on a CT scan and is completely unrelated!) then off to chemo on 20th. I live in Japan and since my Japanese isn't very good some things tend to get lost in translation, but I usually manage to drag along a friend to translate when my husband can't make it to appointments with me. I trust my doctor and I feel we have a good relationship, and Google translate has been our friend! In the whirlwind of info I completely forgot to ask about what stage that all works out as but I'm guessing stage 3? I'll check at my next appointment. I'm struggling a little with how to prepare for chemo. My doctor said my hair will start to jump ship after 3 weeks or so but I'm not too keen on wigs (summer in Japan is ridiculously hot and humid). I have shoulder length hair so I guess I'll get a pixie cut before thyroid surgery on March 8th. Anway, I'm sure I'll have lots of questions and I am a little apprehensive about chemo but we'll get through it together! I'm really grateful for this forum. x",

They said I'd be in for about a week (everything is a 1 week stay here!) so I'll only have a few days at home before starting my 1st FEC100 chemo on March 20th. Bit concerned that I'll be starting chemo just 12 days following surgery but I guess it's fine or they wouldn't have scheduled it. Mastectomy and ALND was on Jan 24th so really eager to get on with it now! Anyone had trouble with cording? I've had pain on and off in my arm since surgery. Feels like a ligament running from my armpit to elbow which stops my arm extending right out. Back of my arm from shoulder to elbow also has nerve damage and feels numb/sunburned all the time. It seems to be getting a little better over time but maybe I'm just getting used to it! I'm doing the arm and body stroking to move the fluid but it's really annoying when you have a few good days and then suddenly it's back to square one for no apparent reason. Ah well. Hope everyone that has started chemo is doing ok. Thinking of you all. x",

My dog has been glued to me since I got home, son (13) glued to his Nintendo switch! 😅 Neck is healing amazingly well (partial thyroidectomy), and you can actually see the difference each day. Voice gets tired towards the end of the day and sometimes a bit uncomfortable swallowing, but I really have very little pain unless I cough or sneeze. I've been told to take it easy, keep the scar covered when I go out, and absolutely no headbanging. 🤟 Have to go back for a checkup and pathology report on 26th, but as my first FEC chemo session is on 20th I'm hoping I'll be ok. 🤞 Guess they'll just have to wait if I'm not! For chemo I've been told to go in at 9am for a blood test, then at 10am meet with my doctor, and if everything looks good I'll go up to the chemo suite and get started. Infusion is straight into a cannula in my arm or hand, so no port. Have been told the infusion should take about 2 hrs and was given the aftercare meds in advance so I don't have to wait around in a pharamacy. I don't have anyone that can come with me for the first one but it'll be fine. I live very near my hospital so can grab a taxi home. Have to go back on 22nd for an injection (not sure what that is but I'll ask on Wednesday). Anyway, I'm really glad that eveyone is managing ok. It's great being able to read the reports as you all get started - makes me less anxious about what to expect. Poky❤️   ",

It's pretty much impossible not to be emotional about your hair (and everything else!). I keep catching glimpses of myself in reflections while I'm out shopping and having to remind myself that it's the new me. We're all here with you on this one - on the positive side you're rocking the short cut. Looking good ",

Blood test came back with extremely elevated liver enzymes, so I was immediately sent for a liver ultrasound. 30 mins later of waiting and panic googling liver mets, my doctor gave me the all clear and that it\u2019s chemo damage. Have to go back for more blood tests in a week. Oh well, at least I have another week of feeling good.",

Had myself psyched up for it too which was kinda disappointing. I wouldn\u2019t mind but Ialready had an extra week this time as there was a 10-day public holiday here and #3 had been postponed. Not sure what will happen if levels stay elevated next week.",

Liver enzymes on Wednesday were just low enough for my doc to cautiously give the go ahead with infusion #3 of 8. Same old vomiting and nausea for the first few days - I\u2019d almost been spoilt after a 5 week break and forgot how much it sucks the life out of me for the first week or so. Fog\u2019s starting to lift though. Amazing that some of you are almost done with your infusions. Serious congratulations on that! I\u2019m almost at the half way point... just seems like never ending sometimes, but I\u2019m trying not to let it get me down. Making the most of the good days.   ",
