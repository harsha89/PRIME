The sleeve and glove are all one piece.  No matter what I tried wearing them as  separate pieces, I had the tourniquet effect and my hand swelled up like a baseball glove.  I had minimal swelling until I started taking Arimidex last February.  Then, BAM!  My question for you all is, if you have a custom sleeve, did your insurance pay for it?  Did you have to submit the claim yourself?  Is there an insurance code?  I have to submit my receipt soon and I'd like for it to go as smoothly as possible.  Paying $500 for one sleeve, I can only afford one at a time.  I'd love to have at least one spare.  Also, my sleeve now has a snag and it seems to be growing, and one hole in a not-so-important place.  What are the warranties on these?  Thanks for any advice!
