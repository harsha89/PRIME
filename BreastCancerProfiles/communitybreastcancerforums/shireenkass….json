We are in Canada where the Oncotype DX and Mammaprint tests are not covered or readily recommended by Healthcare Providers. I have heard about them though, and we did ask our Oncologist about the Oncotype DX test. She said that because it does not take LVI into consideration, that it probably won't help with her recommendation for or against chemotherapy. Do you think it would be beneficial to go ahead with the tests anyways and then take them back to her to see if her recommendation changes? Thanks again for your support, you're an inspiration!",

Your experience is inspiring and we just looked into the cold caps which seem to be a great resource that will take away from a lot of my Mom's anxiety and fear. She just spent the last 2 years growing out her hair and I think it is a big deal for her! I checked out your blog, its nice to see you kept a positive attitude throughout your treatment! What brand of cold caps did you use? Was any of it covered by your insurance provider or other agencies? Thanks again for your support!!",
