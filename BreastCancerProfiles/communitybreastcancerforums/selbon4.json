I don't think I would worry as much if it weren't for this stupid bruise like spot over the lump. One minute I'm okay and the other minute I'm a mess. I'm needing lots of positive thoughts right now girls! Reading some of these posts is the only thing that has kept a little of my insanity Log in to post a reply",

I went to my gyn Monday. He seems to think that it is a cyst that has formed behind my breast implant causing it to push the implant up. He said he doesn't think I should be concerned. I've never really heard off that before, but anyway he wants me to have diagnostic mammo Monday. What is really added to my worry is that this same breast has lots of visible veins on it and there is a bruise where the lump is. My mind is taking me in all different directions. Does anyone have any thoughts or opinions? I'm 43 and extremely scared. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
