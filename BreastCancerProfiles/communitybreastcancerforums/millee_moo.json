I have lots of women on both sides of my family (aunts, cousins, etc...) and all lived to old age with no health problems. No one was diagnosed with or died from any type of cancer at all. I had my parents check and I got it from my dad. I am making an appointment with a genetic counselor to be tested with an approved method, but my mind is spinning and I'm extremely scared. Is it possible to have this mutation and not be at an increased risk due to family history? My parents are pretty convinced that since no one has had it I don't need to worry too much, but I'm not so convinced. BRCA1+ Log in to post a reply",

I am Ashkenazi descent so hopefully that allows insurance to cover it. My dad has the same mutation as I do. He has a sister (age 70) who has a daughter (age 40), so if I'm positive they will probably want to be checked. His mother died of natural causes around age 90.",

I have started a screening plan and will have surgery in the next few years as well. Thank you all for the support!",
