My last steroids were 2 weeks ago though (only during infusion, didn't take any after), so it doesn't seem like they could still be doing this...probably chemo related still. Hope it goes away, reassured that yours did!",

I finished the 4th cycle 2 weeks ago.  (Starting abraxane next week). I wake up and my eyes are sooo swollen. They get a tiny bit better as I'm up and around, but nowhere near normal.  This is from the chemo (or induced menopause?), I did not have it before.  I suddenly look very old and very tired.  For my work, I meet lots of new people, but I'm even just embarrassed seeing my neighbors, etc. (I do have dry eyes too, use drops, eyes aren't red or anything).  I eat well and walk every day, I'm not laying around all day (though wouldn't mind being able too...). So, anyone else with this? Does it go away? Any tips to help?

Probably doesn't help the overall look. So your puffy eyes got better too? Weird how its bugging me more than being unibreasted, etc etc. Maybe because its because its where people look - at your eyes - and its harder to fake health.",
