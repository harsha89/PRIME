He also made the good point that both those countries have government healthcare so it is advantageous to get patients treated faster.   If there is new info, I sure would like to know as I am about to start 6 weeks of rads. I have not heard that they think the sentinel node biopsy is not necessary.  There is some thought that the full lymph node dissection may not be necessary.  As I understand, those nodes are taken out more for diagnostic staging, not to remove cancer.",

I would have a serious talk not only with your RO, but with someone in the hospital who is in charge of hospital infections. Ask if you can make a written complaint. Every hospital has a team that tries to prevent transmission of infections in the hospital. I have a feeling they need to look into their sterilization and cleaning. I find my own hospital truly lacking. During chemo, I refused to sit on the only chair in the blood drawing room because the fabric on the chair looked stained and filthy. I told the tech why when she insisted I sit. She actually insisted it was NOT dirty. I asked the supervisor why the chairs were upholstered in fabric that could not be cleaned. She basically said it was not her fault. When I worked in nursing 32 years ago, things were much cleaner. I know how filthy hospitals are, I can see it .....and the hospital does too, even if they won't admit it. By the way, the doctors are the worst offenders, they rarely wash their hands. Just watch them. Hoping you get it cleared up soon. I'm not sure about MRSA, but usually once you are on antibiotics for a few days, you can not spread an infection. Ask your doctor if there is any contraindication to your working with food.",

The upset stomach is a common SE from antibiotics because they kill all the flora in your intestines. Be sure to eat probiotic yogurt in between doses or take acidophillus to replenish it. That should help the stomach. StacyA- Welcome! I just finished #12 of 33. So far just a little redness and a little itchiness. My RO is a huge believer in Aquafor only (3-4 X a day). As it is so sticky and greasy, I got him to agree to let me use Aloe vera (only from a plant that does not have additives) and Homeopathic Calendula Cream by Boiron (Whole Foods).

Drink 2 quarts fluids a day.  A lot of ladies say exercise or walking helps with the fatigue.   Best of luck!",

I just watched Dr. Oz (droz.com 9/28).  Very interesting and relevant to us.  He had a doctor who specializes in thyroid cancer and also the former head of the Amer. Cancer Soc. (who is a BC survivor).  It seems that thyroid cancer is the fastest growing cancer among women.  Dr. Oz recommends asking for a thyroid shield when you have dental x-rays or mammos (not just the lead apron, a shield that covers your neck).  They said if you had 5 dental x-rays in a year, you were 4 X as likey to get thyroid cancer.  The BC survivor (who had rads) says now that she has had so much radiation, she always asks \"why is this x-ray needed\"?  If it is just routine, she declines, says she doesn't want any additional rads that could cause cancer.  I hope this doesn't stress anyone. I am going to ask if I can have a thyroid shield during my BC rads.  Unfortunately, it is up to US to protect ourselves.  My doctors just do whatever they have always done.",

I have read about the creams that the ROs recommend and have my concerns. As many of you have noted, they are filled with parabens and chemicals.  I stopped using things with these ingredients LONG ago and don't plan on using them now.  She said to use Dove unscented soap. It is filled with chemicals, not even soap.  I have done so much research on bodycare products.   I was in the process of developing my ownline of all natural bodycare products when I was diagnosed.  It came to a screeching halt as I couldn't trust my sense of smell during chemo to deternine what essential oil blends smelled best.  Man oh man did things smell weird! I plan on being my very own little radiation guinea pig. For now, I will use my unscented, all-natural shea soap and creams.  I'll let you guys know what works.  I just hate that the only options these ROs give us are samples of chemical-laden pharmaceutical junk.  I'm going to have a good time educating my RO about better options!",

All you ladies who are headed for Taxotere.  I remember reading somewhere around here that Oncs are recommending taking Glutamine to prevent neuropathy which is a known SE of the Taxanes.  I also think they said you had to load up on this supplement for a while before starting the taxanes in order to have it work best.  I would definitely ask about it.  I find my Onc is not very interested in vitamins, supplements etc, even though research is showing true benefit.  When I do bring it up, she acknowledges that they might help and she has no objection. dsa deb-  I'm with you about the weather.  I am SO looking forward to cooler Autumn days so I can get outside again.  I had a thought about your prickly hair problem.  Sherry suggested Nair or Neet for my numb lymph node-less armpit.  I know these hair removers are made of chemicals, so they might irritate.  It might be worth a small \"patch test\" experiment to see if it removes the stubble and doesn't irritate your scalp.  I know you are used to living dangerously by now!

There are lots of very good meds for nausea. Also don't wait till you are really nauseous to take the meds.  Take them at the first sign.  Once you are truly nauseous it is hard for the meds to knock it down.  Ginger is a natural anti nausea cure.  Sipping ice cold gingerale always helps me.  A lot of people say they get relief from the ginger roots candies (health food store).  I can't tolerate plain water when I am nauseous.  You have to hydrate to flush stuff out.  Try to find something you can tolerate.  Hang in there!  It won't last forever.  Hopefully they can find some meds that will work better nest time.",

Bon- Oh you poor thing.  There is nothing worse than itching (well, maybe nausea). Ages ago, when I was in nursing, I got measles at the age of 21.  I have never been so miserable.  When the Benadryl and other stuff didn't work I ran out in the yard and ran around and around the house in frustration.  My mom just sat on the porch and watched me go round and round!  I do remember oatmeal baths being soothing, worth a google. Hooray for all of you wrapping up part of your treatment.  I am celebrating with you. RS711-  Thanks for posting the list of Dos and Don'ts. I know Dr. Oz had alot of tips too, can probably get more from his website.  I know drinking 2 cups green tea a day can reduce BC by 50% according to a study in Japan.  He says everything in the cabbage family as well as seaweed is very cancer-fighting.   As so many of our doctors are focused solely on the medical side, and, in my opinion, neglect the huge area of nutrition and quality of life, I am starting to research on my own.  A lot of the May chemo girls were talking about a great cookbook, which focuses on nutrition during and after cancer.  I just ordered The Cancer Fighting Kitchen, There are 2 cookbooks by Rebecca Katz: One Bite at a Time and The Cancer Fighting Kitchen. Both deal pretty exclusively with nutritionally sound recipes for patients undergoing cancer treatment and dealing with nausea and bad taste in the mouth, etc.They say the recipes are great, I'll let you know.  The way look at it is we are all trying to optimize our chances, it just makes sense to make our bodies stronger to fight cancer cells and other things too.",

I know you know all the things to support your body.  Remember to sleep and rest as much as possible, even catnaps help.  Stay in the AC if it's hot. Try to avoid anything that takes extra energy to allow your body to re-build and re-charge.  BREATHE to get that oxygen into your cells.  I actually find that I forget to breathe deeply and almost feel short of breath.  When I take a deep breath it is almost like I'm coming up from being under water.  I can feel it! For all you ladies beginning rads (I'm headed there soon), there is a very informative thread called \"Radiation treatment in a prone (face down) position\".  I know that is the \"new\" method, but some people actually think the supine (on your back) is safer for the heart as the heart falls back and out of the way of the radiation.  I have this same concern as my BC is left side and almost where the breast attaches to the ribs.  I am meeting with my Rads Onc again soon and will let you guys know what I find out. ",

Oh, one other thing.  As I was struggling with which chemo to do, and my Onc could not tell me which would be best,she said \"Chemo is not a science, it is an art\".  If your Onc is honest, I bet they will tell you they really don't have proof on chemo regimens.  Every body is so unique.  ",

I would LOVE to lose weight and you are trying to GAIN it.  As someone who has always had to watch my weight, I am pretty conscious of what I eat.   One pound of body fat = 3500 calories.  So if you want to gain 1 pound a week, you need to increase your calories by 3500 calories/week or 500 calories a day.  Two bowls of ice cream a day should do that!   Steady, consistent increase in your calories somehow will work.   I certainly don't mean to make light of this, I know it is probably just as hard for you to gain weight as it is for me to lose it.  Best of luck!",

See any of you there if you want to talk about Tamox.  I was just on the Dr. Love site (for the first time).  It is a great site with very clear explanations of medical matters and studies, including Tamox.  Worth taking a look. http://www.dslrf.org/breastcancer/content.asp?CATID=19&L2=1&L3=6&L4=0&PID=&sid=132&cid=646 I have to take my 11 year old to get his meningitis vaccination.  Now I am fretting about SE of vaccinations again!  What happened to the happy-go-lucky girl who used to ride on motorcycles with no helmet and hitchike alone to California?  Yeah, I know, God protects children and fools!  ",

Needless to say, we are all immune suppressed, anything that helps makes sense to me.  I am off to my primary doctor to show her my butt spot!  She was concerned that because I am immune suppressed, it might get infected.  I hope she doesn't want me on antibiotics, enough with the meds!",

Latte-  You are not alone with the reaction to tape.  Even before chemo, I had the worst reaction to that plastic sealing patch that they put over my surgical incision.  I wasn't supposed to remove it for 48 hours, but it was red, itchy and irritated so I did.  The incision healed beautifully, but my skin, destroyed by the plastic tape patch took longer.  So many of us have reactions to this modern tape, I wonder what chemicals are embedded in it? kitty- Yep, pretty lady....inside and out!You stick to your guns when you talk to your manager!",

It comes in capsules so I don't have to drink that gloppy, yucky slop.  The key is to take it regularly.  I take it 3 X a day with meals and water.   I also have been eating about 3 Fuji apples with peels each day.  Voila!  I'm a happy camper!",

I think it is important not to get too rigid about any way of eating, or it is doomed to failure.  Just try to tweek everything you already like.  So instead of buying a milkshake, make a nutritious fruit smoothy, things like that.  Both these books have been out for a while, might even be in the library.  And like a lot of you, I don't eat out much and when I do, I only eat cooked foods, nothing raw.  OMG, years ago when I was in nursing school, my Microbiology teacher made us culture a restaurant.  You would not believe what grew in those petri dishes!   Carol2-  Welcome!  Best of luck with your tx.  These girls are the best, best, best!  Let us know if you need anything.

Not to mention the risks of hospital infections etc... Genetic testing might ease your mind.  Also, perhaps taking some of the proactive lifestyle steps may give you reassurance.  Walking 5 X a week reduces chances by 30%.  Drinking no more than 7 glasses of wine a week reduces it by 30%.  Making sure your vitamin D levels are normal.  Drinking two small cups of green tea daily reduces it by 50%. Reducing or eliminating sugar, white flour etc...  There is lots of good information on the \"natural girls\" thread. I figure if I keep racking up these lifestyle benefits NOTHING is going to be able to catch me! Bon-  Oh you poor dear!  You just can't get a break!  I am praying they figure out  this latest ailment.  Like you, I am SO over this ordeal. How's your acid reflux?  Has that settled down? My rads hospital is operating with only ONE machine.  Of course they did not tell me this before they signed me up.  SO!  Any time a hospital patient needs the machine or the rads doctors need to do a special procedure, we all get delayed.  So far I have had two appointments and both have been nearly 2 hours late.  They also keep changing my appointments the day before, so my times are all over the place.  This is going to be a VERY long 6 weeks.  And guess who is starting to get a bit cranky?

No mention of Rads Onc, can't imagine she would treat herself. Perhaps she chose a MX and no rads (interesting).  If her Oncotype score was low, chemo was probably not beneficial.  So maybe she just did MX plus hormone therapy?  Whatever, I wish her Godspeed in healing and am forever grateful for this BCO where I have made friends with you wonderful ladies! ",

Okay, the weird Duluth connection has surfaced again.  My cousin who I adore, but rarely speak to, contacted me to say my Aunt, who I am also out of touch with, is near death (Alzheimers and Parkinsons).  Her kids want to cremate her and bury the ashes near her parents (my grandparents) in the Duluth cemetery.  When they called to inquire, it seems my grandparents bought SIX plots!  None of us knew.  We can only theorize they were buying them for their two daughters and their spouses??  My cousin had to get our permission as my mom was the eldest child and heir of these plots.  How weird is that??? Yes, I was jubilant to see those miners rescued and emerge into fresh air and daylight after 70 days.  Such good news! One of my friends works for Campus Crusade for Christ and just told me they (along with some others) provided those t-shirts with the writing on the backs that the miners were wearing.  She said it was in Spanish and quotes Psalm 95:4 \"He holds in his hands the depths of the earth and the mightiest mountains.\"",

I just posted this on another thread, but thought some of you would be interested too.  Just read this on BCO. A new study found that women who take ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure have more than 50% higher recurrence of BC. Wow! I think the study says that if you take ACE inhibitors with beta blockers or beta blockers alone, it does not increase recurrence risk. I don't have high blood pressure, but if I was on ACE meds, I sure would discuss switching to something else. The details are in this link. www.breastcancer.org/risk/new_... ",

I just read this study linking elevated CRP blood levels to breast cancer outcomes.  I will be asking my doctor to test this along with my D3 levels.  Another good reason to focus on anti inflammatory diet and fish oil supplements.  It irritates me that our Oncs don't advise about these lifestyle things that are obviously very important.  Here's the BCO link (sorry linky thing won't work) www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/...  Birdy and Sarah- Welcome! Do you guys realize we are the June 2010 chemo group? Of course we will all try to help you as much as we can, but there is something extraordinary about going through chemo at the same time with people. We have all become such close friends this past year. There is a new thread called \"Jun 2011 chemo\" that you should also check out. If you copy and paste this link, you will find it. Wishing you the best of luck as you go through this next phase!  Let us know if we can help.  Golly, we are veterans by now. community.breastcancer.org/for...",

I have a feeling that not only are your emotions overwhelmed (understandably), your body is too.  Definitely call your MO and tell them you are vomiting and not getting a lot of fluids and wonder if the Vicodin could be causing this. They may want you to come in and get some IV fluids which might help immediately. Rather than canceling your last chemo, could you just postpone that decision?  You can always cancel it the day before!  I'm afraid if you make that decision, you will become totally entrenched and not consider doing it.  Also, I can't remember where I read it, but I think that if you don't complete ALL the chemo cycles, it is almost as if you did not do it at all (as far as benefits).  I would hate to think that you went through this misery for nothing.  I sure hope you can get time off of work, I'm sure that is impossible in your condition.  If your employer can not provide temporary disability, perhaps your state can?  I think there are options. Also, I am seeing that you are triple negative, so I think the chemo is even more important.  Maybe some of the triple neg ladies can speak to that.   Praying for you Vicky.  Come back here and talk to us and we will try to help. For all you ladies wondering about drug interactions, I have found this site helpful.  www.drugs.com/drug_interaction...   You just type in any meds and it spot checks their interactions together.  You need to know the complete name of your chemo (Cytoxan, not just C).  I think it may even check interactions with food.  I think a pharmacist is more knowledgeable, but this is a good \"spot check\". Jackie-  Oh you are a better woman than me!  Motorcycles!  Camping!  Horseflies!  Don't over do the travel thing.  You are still probably immune compromised.  How are your blood counts?  Might give you reassurance or more need for caution.  My white counts were only 900 last Friday before chemo and I went ahead anyway so by now they may be lower yet.  I am the \"germ cop\" big time right now. I'm trying to avoid crowds, kids etc...  Nothing like being paranoid!",

Many years ago I worked as a nurse so had seen some very serious allergic reactions. When I arrived for my first chemo I interrogated the poor nurses about all the emergency procedures etc... Thankfully, my lovely chemo nurse reassured me. She told me 1st timers got a special chair right next to the oxygen and she showed me how she had already prepared all the emergency meds on the counter behind my special chair knowing I was a first timer. She also said they did the drip extra slow on the first day and she would stay right by my side watching for any side effects. She barely left my side during the whole infusion and I was very grateful. Be sure to tell them about your allergy history and reassure yourself by asking about emergency procedures they have in place. I'm sure they will take good care of you. I pray it all goes smoothly for you.

He was in remission for 12 years, but it came back and he is now in heaven waiting for us. At his memorial, a gorgeous, young girl told of her memories at the cancer camp they attended each summer. She, too was a survivor and remembered slow dancing, as a bald, ill, young girl with this handsome boy. Imagine a \"normal\", 14 YO boy choosing to slow dance with a sick, bald girl, it probably would never happen. It struck me how, once faced with cancer, we are more able to truly see the real beauty in people. It's as if I see right through the nonsense to the important things. I have met so many brave, beautiful, funny, BALD women during this journey. I feel forever changed in a good way. As for all of you beautiful friends. I will love you forever....bald, fat, skinny, wrinkled or whatever!",

Sometimes people are \"stupie\" as my son and I say.  Also, sometimes they don't want to presume.  Something that has helped me help all my \"want to help but don't know how\" friends is a list of chores on the fridge.  That way, when they ask \"what can I do?\"  you can say \"there's a list on the fridge, pick anything and it will help.\"  Not to mention, with your chemo brain kicking in, YOU might not remember anything to tell them!  Have a wonderful day everyone.  I'm off to see Toy Story 3 with my 11 year old son.  I know I'm going to cry, as my guy is growing up just like Andy.My friend told me her 17 YO son and his friends also confessed to crying.",

Haljen-   Definitely stay in touch with your Onc, especially if he starts running a fever.  Be careful with giving Ibuprofen too much because it is very hard on the stomach and liver (and his liver is working overtime with chemo).  Never, ever give it on an empty stomach. Make sure he drinks tons of fluids, especially with a bladder infection.  If he can't handle water, find other things, even juicy fruits.  My favorite was watermelon.  I sure hope he can book out of work for a while.  He really needs to rest, he doesn't realize how hard his body is fighting.Oh!  If you do eat beets, be prepared for red urine.  It looks like blood, but is from beets.",

I am still in the research mode.  I think the bigger your recurrence risk, the bigger your benefit.  With a lower recurrence risk, your benefits are also lower.  Tamoxifen has a lot of SE including heart, stroke, blod clot and uterine cancer.  As I will be getting radiation on my left side, very close to the chest wall, the radiation may \"kiss\" the heart and lungs, which may cause some heart damage.   If Tamox can cause additional heart problems, that's a concern. I also have a non-sympomatic blood condition which caused me to miscarry three times (due to clotting in placenta).  So I have to weigh whether the benefits outweigh the other health risks.  If I was at higher risk, I might think differently. Also, I am perimenopausal.  Tamoxifen is usually given to premenopausal women.  I think then you switch to Aromatase inhibitors.  I think there is new information just out that seems to say the Aromatase inhibitors can be used as effectively.  SO much research, my poor brain is exploding! jenweg- I haven't had nose sores with chemo, but my son has that problem in the winter.  I found this rather \"old fashioned\" ointment called Boroleum.  It comes in a tube and seems to work well.  Like with everything else, nausea, constipation etc....it's best to be proactive.  A little on a q-tip every night will keep your nose happy.  Once cracks or lesions start, it is harder to get rid of them.  I also swear by tea tree oil.  However DON'T use it undiluted.  I have actually used the tea tree oil chap stick (on a q-tip) and it works too. JFV- So sorry about your Onc's scary statistics.  It is her job to tell you everything, including the worst case scenarios.  Just know there are countless people who BEAT the odds, even lousy ones!  Just today I ended up sitting next to a gentleman in chemo. DH and I couldn't believe it as he was a former colleague of DH.  Small world or another \"God Wink\".  This guy has been through such an ordeal, tumor on the spine which they said would leave him paralyzed after surgery.  After surgery they kept \"testing\" his legs for feeling.  He finally told them to leave him alone, his legs worked fine.  The doctors just couldn't seem to accept that he was NOT paralyzed.You just keep your eyes on the prize and beat those odds! Thanks to everyone for the BRCA feedback.  More research!  Okay, I think I need a snooze now. I didn't sleep much last night and chemo tuckered me out.",

The recipes are fantastic and we have never eaten better!  I even serve them to company and they rave about them. It seems a lot of you are monitoring your Vitamin D levels.  My Onc hasn't mentioned this, but I know it's important.  Are all of yours being monitored?

Once you get some possibilities, you will be able to research better.  I couldn't research because I didn't know the particular chemo regimens which would be right for me until I met the Oncologist.  Don't hesitate to say \"could you repeat that, I want to write that down\".  Good luck tomorrow.",

It concerned me that your Onc didn't bring you in when you were SO sick.  As a matter of fact, most good Oncs ask if you would like a second opinion.  They should never think that it is because you are doubting their recommendation, simply that you want to confirm it is the best aproach.  This is YOUR life, you have to be sure of your treatment.   Bon-  I totally agree that SO many people just don't know how to deal with someone with cancer.  I think it is sort of like I used to be about babies and kids.  I THOUGHT I knew what it was like to have kids.   NOT!  Until I had my own child, I really didn't have a clue.  I now think back and am embarassed about my sometimes intolerant attitude about kids.  That old \"until you walk in my mocassins\" quote is so true.  I commend you for taking the time to help the people in your life become more comfortable with cancer.   And yes, The Wizard of Oz has to be one of my very favorite movies.  I sang \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\"  to my son at bedtime every night (when I wasn't spoofing on him and singing \"Somewhere Over the Bananna\").  I believe ANYTHING is possible, just like in the movie, and that includes long, healthy, happy lives for all of us. On a related note, I am still trying to find time to make a sign for my bedroom office that reads \"No one gets in to see the Wizard, no way, no how\". ",

If the pharmaceutical companies had a pill with those stats, we would all be paying big bucks to eat it!  I think it is smart for all of us to use ALL aproaches to get and stay healthy.  Now if I can just get motivated to start exercising!",

Sherry-thank goodness your Onc is rethinking your treatment.  There are many alternatives.  Like my Onc said, there isn't a better, stronger chemo.  They all work in different ways.  You will accomplish what you need with a different regimen.  I pray you will be SE free!  You have earned it.  Now that you are feeling a bit better, try to boost your fluids if you can.",

It also analyzes your specific cancer to see how it will respond to chemo. I believe you can still have the test done as pathology labs are required to keep your tissue \"on file\".  I would call the Oncotype folks to discuss.  They were very helpful and informative",

Who knew Duluth, Minnesota was such a destination?  Though my mom talked about it so often, I have never been there.  I would like to go someday, but not in the winter.  Mom told me they put their car up on blocks for the winter, too cold to start them (1920s). I love the t-shirt slogan idea!  I bet we could all come up with some terrific sayings!",

If you guys haven't read it yet, I highly recommend Anticancer by Servan-Schreiber.  It is written by a doctor who is a cancer survivor who has researched nutritional and lifestyle things that are beneficial to keeping cancer from recurring.  Some cultures have low rates of cancer (Japan, India, China). There is lots of evidence that diet can help (brocolli, geen tea, turmeric).  It seems the western way of eating is the worst.  The book is footnoted throughout with studies.  It is fascinating.  It also gives me the feeling of doing something, now that I am finished with surgery, chemo and rads.  Of course I am thrilled to be done, but it is weird too.  Kind of like surviving a ride on a wild, runaway horse!",

Their phone is on the report.  I don't know if they are there on a Saturday, but it sure is worth a try.  I would also think that this would be a TOTALLY legitimate reason to call your Onc's service on the weekend and tell him your concerns.  Especially as you are scheduled for chemo Monday, he will understand.  You need this all clarified before proceeding with your chemo ESPECIALLY if you might have to change.  This must be awful for you.  Let us know what you find out. chey-  good your are tracking your temps.  You will get through this, just like all the other things! Bon-  I could see how that would not be easy to take.  I know a lot of ladies have as bad or worse SE from the steroids.  As you appear to be sensitive to meds, it could be the steroids.  I'm wondering if there is a thread on here for Cytoxan, Taxotere+Herceptin users.  You could get a lot of long-term info if there is.  I know the CMF thread has been going since 2006 and I have learned so much there. ",

Okay, I'll tell you guys why I know so much about essential oils.  Last year, being totally underwhelmed with all skincare products, expensive or not, I started developing a skin and bodycare line of products. With a laboratory,  I perfected two lotions and was almost finished with the scents.  I am using only pure essential oils and botanicals, no synthetic fragrance.  THEN!  Boom! I found the lump and I have been riding this wild BC horse ever since. So everything screeched to a halt. One of my scents, inspired by my lovely German grandma, is predominantly lavender, also has other essential oils in it.  If you guys want to be my little chemo skincare guinea pigs, I will gladly send you free samples.  Just PM me.",

Bon-  Fabulous photo.  I think it is more \"you\"  than your old photo. I have had the priviledge of getting to know YOU, not how you look, but your heart, during all these months.  Like Gin said, your other photo was certainly pretty, this one is beautiful and radiant.  I LOVE beautiful silver hair.  Mine is all salt and pepper, I wish it was completely gray.  My favorite fashion model is Carmen, an older, gorgeous woman who allowed her silver hair to shine.  She was so much more interesting than the others. I love the description of the pearl, especially knowing that pearls are formed when angels pass through the clouds of heaven.  Bon, I am so glad your vacuuming mishap helped us choose our perfect jewel.  We are all true pearls, beautiful, luminous and uncrushable! I have been struggling with the \"what if it comes back\" conversations in my head a lot lately. I bet a lot of you have those too!  Now that I am finished with active treatment, I need to stay positive and try not to live in fear.  I read the following post from one of our BCO sisters and it just put it all into perspective.  I don't know why, but it just helped me shift my stinkin' thinkin' a lot.  I thought you would all appreciate it. Posted by BrandyB April 4, 2011 \"One dream that I had early in treatment gives me peace. My dearest best friend, who happened to die recently in a fluke accident, came to me in my dream. She told me in her California valley girl accent \"Brandy, just because you have cancer doesn't mean you are going to die, just like not having cancer means you're going to live, hello?!?!?!\" Before she died and before I had cancer, we were busy helping our two friends that had cancer. We felt sorry for them and assumed they were dying. Well, those two people are in remission and my dear friend has died. Before that dream, I felt robbed of a secure future. After God sent me Steph in my dream, I realized that the only thing I lost was a FALSE sense of security. None of us know what the future holds. Cancer or no cancer. Try not to make up wild stories of the future in your mind. One thing is for certain, those stories are NOT true. If you want to envision yourself well and happy then I encourage those thoughts... The negative ones need to stop. Literally tell yourself that those bad thoughts are lies and falsehoods that your mind created, NOT the future.\"",

Although one of the doctors said he thinks it might be Herpes Simplex, like a cold sore. What fresh hell is this??   I had chicken pox as a kid and it remains dormant in the body. With my suppressed immune system, it seemed to kick up the Herpes Zoster virus and hence, shingles.  As it seems to be healing on its own, she thought I did not have to take the huge initial dose of Acyclovir, just a prophylactic dose so that I don't have a worse outbreak with the remaining chemos.  I have read that the pain from shingles is some of the absolutely worse pain, sure wouldn't want a worse outbreak.   And on we go!  So the plan is that I have to stay on Acyclovir till the end of chemo. tmarina- I'm sorry you are so pooped and might not make that long trip to KC.  I bet the sisters will have fun, too bad you may have to miss it.",

Maybe it will help with sleep.  Their web site is www.auracacia.com.

I can't imagine that they don't have some kind of exemption for women with tissue expanders! Maybe if you google about it? I'm so sorry you have to be put through this. You have been so brave and optimistic through this ordeal. This is the last thing you need! Bon- You are SO close! Hang in there! I am trying to walk a LOT, trying to trick the rads fatigue Some days I just get carried away in this great city and keep going! Walking is my favorite, and only exercise. I don't even have a car, love exploring New York even after 26 years. So far I have only had brief waves of fatigue. Finished #9 rads today, only 24 more to go! Have a great weekend everyone. As we are experts in everything scary....let's go out and scare someone for Halloween!",

Sherry-  Nice new photo.  Even if walking is tough, just do a little at a time so you get stronger.  Maybe just make the goal to go to the mailbox every day and then build on it?  Yeah, when I click on any of the BCO threads now, it takes me to the top of the page.  Maybe they are having technical problems.  There is a \"jump to the bottom\" sentence that at least gets you to the most recent posts. I can't tell you how good it feels to be moving this old, tired body.  Today I walked about 80 blocks through the park.  I find if I do it first thing in the day, it sets me up for lots of energy and positive thinking for the whole rest of the day. gin2ca-  Have you had an LE evaluation?  I know it is important to jump on that early, it really makes a difference.  It's important to get baseline measurements.  Have you been fitted for a sleeve?  If you have swelling, I know it's good to wear it, especially if you are working in the garden.  ",

I did not have to take the Neulasta or Neupogen. Some people report less pain from Neulasta.  I know it is more expensive and insurance can contest it.  If he is having such pain from Neupogen, I think your doctor could request that he needs to try Neulasta.  It might be worth a discussion.",

I believe the majority of those of us who had AND (whether we were ill informed or not) are not having problems, certainly not to this degree.  As many of us had our nodes removed, and live with plenty of fears, it is wrong to use these scare tactics.  Do I need to wonder if I will end up looking like your photos?  No!  It takes enough stamina to research and stay healthy and positive. Does anyone remember reading a study that said the chances of LE were dramatically reduced if no more than nine nodes were removed?  I can't find it.  I recall that it is a new recommendation, enough nodes to stage, but still leaving enough to reduce risk of LE.",
