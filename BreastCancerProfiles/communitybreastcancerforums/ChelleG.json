Yuck!ü§¢ I am NED on this stuff,so I don\u2019t dare change tx. I have to take so much crap,just to feel somewhat normal. All in all,it\u2019s worth it! I have a ton of scans coming up. Breast MRI,hip and pelvic MRI as well as a brain MRI. Fun stuff! I had a little vacation at the hospital earlier this summer.During my stay,they did a brain scan to see if I had mets. I did not have Mets but they found what appears to be epilepsy. I\u2019m hoping that it is just from my childhood.I have no seizures, but I\u2019m still a little uneasy about it,because it looks like a form of epilepsy that can not be treated. Ugh! Always so much crap going in our lives. Wouldn\u2019t it be great to just effing forget about this for a few days? The weather here is so crazy! We had snow last week and it will be near 80 today. Going to grill hamburgers! My Dh loves to grill and smoke meats. My favorite thing in the whole world,are his smoked baby backs. Yummyüòã Mel- please stay in bed and rest as much as possible! Drink a ton of o.j. And water. I hope you are feeling good soon! Lynn Manchester- I am on pills for hypertension also. I only take them every other day now,due to the same thing that you are dealing with. Ugh! Mae- those little brain mets,messed with the wrong girl. You will kill them and scare them away forever! You go girl! I want to get to know all of you better. I have been feeling very lonely for a friend lately. All but one of my friends,still speak to me. After dx,they all seemed so supportive,then they just disappeared. It hurts,but I don\u2019t need them. I am all about family. My husband Patrick, is everything to me. Yes I have three daughters,but we have always put our relationship above everything. Because if Pat and I aren\u2019t good,nothing would be. I have also set a very high standard for my daughters,they see him and I love each other everyday. They expect that from their men as well. We are beginning to run into some trouble,concerning his accident and recovery. Denver is refusing to pay for his medical care. If they put him back on the street,before he is 100%,I will be one pissed off lady. I will sue the crap out of them!! We have a lawyer for this work comp crap. And also a personal injury lawyer. Beyond that, we have put it in the hands of God. There is no sense in getting all up tight about it. It is what it is. Worse case scenario, medical retirement...... He is only 44üò†üò°üò§ We were only in our new house,for two weeks and one day,when this happened. Me with my bone mets,put everything in place,hung the pictures ect.... we have been unable to do any landscaping,due to his physical injuries and lack of money. Hard to make money,when you can\u2019t work!! Now I\u2019m ranting. Better stop,before I get all worked up. I am an avid gardener,so this was really a tough summer for me. We have almost three acres of buffalo grass. My SIL has nearly finished a backyard fence,but that is all. I am looking forward to spring,like never before.üå≤üå≥üå∏üå∫üåπüå∑ü•Äüåªüåºüíê I should really try to get to sleep,now that I\u2019m all drugged up and dry. Love to you all. Chelle.",

She told her that she can\u2019t handle being away from me so much. I have an appointment with her tomorrow,to discuss what can be done. They are tailoring her a curriculum, to be done half at school and half at home. She will only need to be there two days a week. Katey loves school has many friends. Always been an excellent student. But this dx. Has torn her apart. My whole family of course. But Katey is the Baby.... Can\u2019t imagine why this happened to us. But I do know that we should always make the best of everyday.with or without cancer! We have only one crack at this life thing. So we need to not only endure this dx. But embrace our world. As much as this sucks. There are still things to be happy about,laugh about,be excited about. I spent my entire summer feeling sorry for myself. When I should have been thanking God for my husbands life. And mine as well. I don\u2019t know when I will die,but when I do,I will have a smile on my face because I will have lived a life of love. The one friend that I have left,is having a party this Friday. We are going to try and go for a little while. I haven\u2019t seen some of these people since before dx. I hate having to explain why I still have hair. Why they haven\u2019t cut my boobs off...... I\u2019m so sensitive, I don\u2019t want to end up crying. Grr. This is such a difficult thing to have to go through! Mae- my dh makes philly cheese steak sandwiches too. Sooo yummy! I haven\u2019t watched t.v. For years. My kids were always interrupting me, so I gave up. I need to start watching again. I just have no idea where to start. With Netflix I guess. I need to try to sleep now. Much love to everyone!

Who needs a group,that makes you feel like poo? Stay here, where we understand! A dog for Emma sounds like an amazing idea! Claudia- so sorry for you,to have lost Anastasia. But certainly skittles happiness makes you feel better. Your little grand man is adorable!!! Mae- your trip looked amazing!! Love all of the pics! Enjoy your dh! My Dh and I have some decisions to make. DPD is trying to get him back to work. They really have been wonderful,through this whole ordeal. The commander out at the airport. (Denver international airport) called him. Wants him out there. So, he might actually be going back to work! He just wouldn\u2019t be working a beat. He will mostly be giving people directions,walking the terminal and concourses. Something to think about!!! Love to all of you! Stay warm!!",

I get the feeling,that Gracie has too. But let's just talk about dh accident today. March 10,2017 my husband a 20 year vet of the Denver police Department, went to work. Like any other day over the last sixteen years,he hopped on his Harley,and proceeded to go run radar. At 3:00 in the afternoon,He spots a guy doing 60 in a 35. Busy three lane street in downtown Denver. He got in behind him ,lights on. The man went from 55 to 0 in the middle of the street. He stopped so suddenly that the rear of his car, came off the ground. Of course my dear Patrick, hit the back of his car and then flipped over it, landing on his head. The guy jumped out with a fresh tattoo across his chest reading thug life. He said the fucken pig wanted me to stop, so I fucken stopped. His decision has changed our lives, forever. Patrick is healing from a traumatic brain injury,broken leg,shredded bicep and all of the tendons in his shoulder needed mending. He has not worked a day since the accident. But he is expected to make a full recovery.‚ù§Ô∏èüòä I can't even begin to tell our story, until I tell you my past. Let me give you all of the basic info. We have three daughters. 27,22,15.

Our little community on this thread will have the greatest holiday season! It is so nice to put the scans behind us! My DH is likely going to be medically retired.

But they can\u2019t put him back on the streets in his condition. Trying to not think of what the future might hold for us. But it is hard!!! He would retire with only forty percent of his current pay. In the grand scheme of things,money doesn\u2019t matter. But we will be moving somewhere cheaper than co. I\u2019m thinking rural Texas. But am up for any suggestions. Our house here is $ 500,000.00. Just to give you an idea of what would be less expensive! We are both suffering our own major medical problems.

Always drawing strength from all of the well wishes and prayers sent our way.keep them coming! We need them as much as ever!! I hope everyone had an awesome thanksgiving! I have been cooking like crazy. We had the big turkey dinner on the 18. They only day all of our kids could be here together. Then on the 23rd, I made cheese enchiladas,rice,beans,chili rellenos ,green chili,and beef flautas, as well as bean flautas for the little ones. I am not cooking a single thing this weekend!!

Claudia - would hiring a little help be an option? I can\u2019t imagine doing everything on my own. How is that pain in your side? Your thumb? Is bigb alright? How was his vet visit?you can melt like butter and still be my hero! Good news Mae! Gracie - wish I could be there physically to help you along. You are in my heartfelt prayers. We are here for you.

Hoping you and dh and son are all doing much better very soon! Claudia- your property looks like heaven!! Why NC? If it's mountains you want, come and be my neighbor!!! Mae- sounds wonderful! Where is your cabin? Do you want to adopt a 48 yr.old? I would love to live in a small secluded cabin!!! That's how I picture heaven for me. Gracie- I am sooo glad that you had the whole crown thing figured out!! I hate that you are alone!!!! You are stronger that Samson!!! You may not feel it sometimes,but you are a true warrior of life!! Again I am humbled!! Micmel- such a cute doggie!! I have three. Two little mutts and two big ones!! I love them to pieces! The little ones sleep in bed with us. They are so comforting!! Lynn- I just love reading your well written, heartfelt posts. You are a true sweetheart! I bet New England is beautiful right now! Would love to see it someday!!! I see the pictures of the fall foliage,and it looks like heaven on earth. Beautiful!!üçÇüçÅ I have already written so much,but figured I would continue on with the next oprah segment. As you would imagine,while my sister was declining,I was becoming an adult. I married very young. 19 years old. I thought that shaping my own life,would give me some of the stability I was looking for. Haha!! My husband began cheating on me,two years into the marriage. I could feel that there was something missing,but never knew for sure, until he told me of his many affairs 10 years into our marriage. We went to marriage counseling and figured out our problems.... At the same time,Teresa was deemed terminal and was put on hospice. I lost forty pounds that year,due to stress. I was able to put the marriage problems on the back burner and focus on my sister. He was jealous of the time I spent with her. Even if it was to feed her and change her diapers. He didn't care. I wasn't giving him enough attention. I also had a four year old daughter of my own,to look after,as well as Teresa's daughter Elizabeth 9 years old at the time. Teresa passed away November 19,1999 I don't even remember Christmas that year. But I remember New Year's Eve. My ex said that he was going to take me and the girls to the fireworks. He never came home that night. By Valentine's Day, He came to me and told me that his girlfriend was pregnant, and would I please forgive him!!!! Hahahaha I loaded up my pick up with my kid and her toys. Pulled out of the driveway and threw the garage door opener in the lawn. I was done!!!! I have never looked back. Funny,I thought that I loved him. I had no idea what love could feel like,until a few short weeks later...... My ex has now been divorced four times and filed bankruptcy three times!! So glad that I didn't stick it out!!! 11 years of marriage with him. I still hold the record. His other marriages have lasted five or less. He still cheats and lies. He even has a tinder account. People never change. Love and hugs to everyone!!!! Chelle",

If he should find another job,or just stay home and do the yard work. It is hard to believe that it has been a year and a half,since his accident. For the new ladies and dear Daniel,my husband is a Denver Police Officer,he was hurt intentionally while patrolling on his motorcycle. He suffered many fractures,surgeries but most worrisome has been his traumatic brain injury. He can no longer handle the stress of the job,with a brain injury. I have been on tamoxifen for 36 months. For the first time since dx,I am having an increase in my pain. I have a pet scan in September. I think I will just wait it out. I have my first appointment with the pain clinic in a month. Ridiculous wait times for these doctors!! Tanya- I had cancer cells in my bone marrow. They have disappeared!! And so will yours! I am praying for you! Mae- Hooray on your brain mri results!!

I love that you have always lived in your home town. As well as most of your kids and Mother. It sounds so quaint. I have always wanted to see the northeast. It looks so beautiful in pictures. I know that my posts are few and far between. But I do love each and every one of you! I am always asking Mel how the ladies are doing. I am just so busy with ten people living in my house!! I never have a moment to myself. It is 3:15 am this is my alone quiet time. Crazy,I know Congratulations on your new addition Kathryn! There is nothing better than the smell of a babies head.

Ready for another oprah? I was born in San Antonio 1969. I was healthy at the beginning, but by the time I was three,I had enlarged tonsils and adenoids. Not the usual enlargement. I couldn't taste or smell. I was only 19 pounds when I was a three almost four year old. I made it through surgery,they only gave me a 50/50 chance. All seemed well for a year or so. When I was five,I started having seizures. Several a day. I now had epilepsy. My childhood was spent by my mothers side. Never swimming,riding a bike,nothing. I had an older sister to keep me company sometimes. She was only two years older. We got along great. Best friends,shared a locker in high school. I can remember as kids,even teens,spending the night together. We would bring our blankets ect,in the others bedroom. A very close sibling relationship. My epilepsy medication was more than my parents mortgage payment. I had the best neurologist in the 1970's. His name was Dr.Moe. I can remember seeing him several times on the Jerry Lewis telethon. He told me that I would be able to drive,have children and just be a normal person. So I learned to swallow pills when I was five. And Dr.Moe was right. I haven't had a seizure since I was ten. Things were good for a couple of years. Then my sister Teresa began to have trouble lifting her feet off the ground. Would stumble and fall sometimes. I can remember as cheerleaders together,she would sit out,when she got hot. After a few months of this. We took her to the Dr. She was dx with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis at 19 years of age. She decided to live as hard as she could, until she could no longer do anything. She had a baby girl when she was 22. Elizabeth Ann. But sadly,she lost even more physical ability after childbirth. She spent the next nine years in bed, before passing away at home at the very young age of 32. Mom and I took care of her with the help of hospice. It was the most heart wrenching experience of my life. I am proud to have adopted Elizabeth and can now call myself a grandma. Elizabeth is her legacy. It will be eighteen years since her death this November 19th. I never went to college,never partied with friends. Life's biggest lesson was taught to me at a very young age. I don't regret a minute of it!! I don't blame her illness. I would do it all the same,if I had to do it again. A career be damned. Love is everything. The only thing that matters the only thing that lives on, after death Love you ladies!!!",

Sometimes I feel high. But it's not an out of control feeling, like you get with alcohol. More warm and fuzzy feeling. It has also helped with my mood swings and anxiety. I'm not real sure what's working, but right now, I won't change a thing!!",
