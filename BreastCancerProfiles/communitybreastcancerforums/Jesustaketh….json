Finally, someone replied! üòÅ my indentation is only on my left breast, and same like yours my left breast gave me this weird look/ shape after taking off my bra but eventually somehow after sometime or if I'm massaging it, it goes back to being round (shape) but I don't experience nipple inversion. I hope you get your ultrasound soon, pls. Keep me posted. And I do pray that we're just freaking out or worrying about nothing. It's hard, like I sometimes lose sleep trying to read everything on the net. Googling drives me crazy, but I can't seem to stop. ",
