At the same time, I felt extremely ill - chills, just could not get warm, headache, sinus like infection, etc. My breast was very painful. I had some left over antibiotics for a prior breast lift (a year earlier) ... just a couple ... which I took (I know, I should not be using left over antibiotics :() The night I took my first pill, I had horrific night sweats and woke to what felt like sleeping on icicles. I went to the an urgent care ER - of a very good large hospital. They did an ultrasound and put me on Clindamycin as their diagnosis was cellulitis (I'm 54 years old). The ultrasound did not find anything unusual other than thickening of the skin which said could support the diagnosis of cellulitis. They did tell me to follow up with my OBGYN and get a mammo. I met with her the next day and she is calling in an order for a mammo as well as a breast MRI. But it may be a week until I get the breast MRI. Needless to say, the doctors have mentioned IBC to me and of course, I'm in a panic. I have been on antibiotics for three days ... the swelling has greatly subsided, the pain is almost completely gone ... however, the redness is still there!! The redness is minimal in the morning but as the day progresses, the redness is more predominant. If it is IBC, does the amount of redness change throughout the day? I wake up happy with minimal redness and by lunch it still looks like it did before ... I'm hoping someone can weigh in on the redness please ... Log in to post a reply",

I did not take my temperature but I was so sick feeling at the exact time the breast started to 'swell' and turn red. I don't know if it was a coincidence but it happened at the same time. I had something akin to flu like symptoms. I had another medical scare two years ago that just made me go a bit crazy. At 52 I stopped having my period - assumed menopause until I had a several episodes of expelling blood clots. Memorial Herman hospital diagnosed me as having a very large tumor in my uterus - endometrial cancer. Was confirmed by my OBGN and an oncologist at MD Anderson .... that is until finally someone looked at my pregnancy test and everything changed. MD Anderson thought that I had a molar pregnancy or choricarcinoma as a result of a molar pregnancy. The pathology at my hysterectomy said no molar pregnancy, no choriocarcinoma and the large tumor that I had ... no longer there. Only a very small nodule that they determined was a rare pregnancy related malignancy .... only 100 known cases in last 17 years. Md Anderson said that they did not really know how to treat. Ended up having the top expert in the country redo my pathology and he said that he definitely ruled that out as well as choriocarcinoma. His diagnosis - atypical pregnancy and miscarriage. My blood levels all returned to normal and I'm fine except no longer having all my women parts. It was a scary experience and this is just bringing everything back ðŸ˜•   ",
