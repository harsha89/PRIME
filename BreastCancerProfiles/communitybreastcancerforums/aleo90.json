Because she wanted to see if  he wanted to take more images earlier in the mammogram.  I guess I'm just freaking out now and over thinking things.",

When I first went in for my appointment, the technician told me that we may not do the mammogram because I'm young. She then told the ultrasound technician, \"she's only 27, so we may not do the mammogram.  I went in for my ultrasound and the technician went over the lump a couple of times. I can feel the wand going over it every time, it was painful. She then gave me the wand and told me to go over the lump myself, I guess to verify that the lump is there (idk). She then told me to wait, she left the room. She soon came back and told me that we'll be doing the mammogram. It was my first mammogram, so I was nervous.  The technician took two images of my left breast. She then said (referring to the lump), \"it's nowhere where you told me\". She indicated that it was in a different position. She then took another image.  After the mammogram, she asked me to wait so she can talk to the doctor. To me, she was acting like suspicious (I guess its just me being nervous). She then came back, looked at me then looked at my paperwork and in a sad voice said, \"You're just a baby.\" I asked her if she found something but she only that she doesn't know what the ultrasound found and we have to talk to the doctor.  I heard whispers out in the hallway (I'm not sure if they were talking about me), it made me feel like something was wrong and they weren't telling me.  Then all of a sudden, she comes back in the room and she looks surprised and says, \"the doctor says your fine.\" That's it. It was so nonchalant. I know they can't lie or anything but I feel like she was so abrupt at that point.  My doctor will get the official results this week, so I will wait until my next appointment to get the determination.  Is the way the technician acted kind of strange?",

She told me that the ultrasound didn't find anything, nor did the mammogram. After that she said, \"but I felt it.\" She then continued to say that its probably just lumpy breast and since the ultrasound didn't find anything; no masses or microcalcifications, that I'm fine.  However, the report stated, \"Clinical indictaion: left breast lump, outer lower quadrant. So I asked her what it was and why is it hurting, she said it could probably be that my breasts are just lumpy, especially due to my age. Also, she said the pain can either come from my period or if I take birth control.  I received a copy of my report and it states that I'm BIRADS 1 - Negative. My doctor did mention that the mammogram is not always accurate but she sees nothing, everything is negative. She told me if the lump gets bigger and it still hurts to come back to her and she will order a MRI.  I'm happy because I was extremely worried but if they didn't find anything on the ultrasound and mammogram, how can they be sure that nothing's there?  And doesn't it sound unusual that I have to wait until the lump gets bigger because another test is ordered?  I just want to dot my i's and cross my t's.",

This aggressive pain just started happening last weekend and this week.  I am going to my doctor next week to see what going on and most likely get the breast MRI ordered. Has anyone had experience with getting a BIRADS 1 - Negative result but feeling more pain in the same breast later, with the pain moving to a new location?",

I hope everything goes well for you. I received a letter in the mail today from the imaging office and it said my mammogram was normal. It also stated that I now need to go for yearly mammograms.  My appointment with with PCP isn't until next Monday, so I don't know the actual results yet.  While I'm extremely relieved that the letter said my mammogram was normal, there was nothing within that stated why it was normal. Also, I had my mammogram and ultrasound on 7/7/14 and the letter was dated the same day and mailed out that same day. Is it normal to have such a fast turnaround? I'm still worried because, I still have this lump and it is still painful to the touch. I hear so many bad stories about the results that state that its normal and then something comes up later.  I'm hoping my appointment with my PCP on Monday will alleviate all of my fears.  Thank you so much everyone for \"listening\" to me vent and for your support.",

About two months ago, I did a self-exam and felt something out of the ordinary. I felt a lump that was hard and it felt like it was moving at the time. I had pain under my arm and at that area.  Yesterday I went to my doctor and she did an exam and her face immediately changed when she felt my breast. She told me she feels the lump and its not moving. She then gave me a prescription for a mammogram and an ultrasound.  I'm nervous. I have a family history of breast cancer. Three of my relatives have already died from the disease and I have an aunt who is currently battling it.  Today, I called the imaging clinic to schedule my mammogram and ultrasound and the receptionist told me that they will do the ultrasound first, because I'm \"so young\" and then the radiologist will determine if I need the mammogram. Is this typical?  The last thing I need right now is for them to not take me seriously.  Log in to post a reply",

What is GC?  I spoke to someone about genetic testing. They told me about how my insurance won't cover it for someone my age and if my aunt who has breast cancer has tested positive for the gene, then I have the gene.  I'm going to contact another clinic about genetic testing because I'm not comfortable with my other experience.",
