Bil mastectomy, w/TRAM reconstruction, sentinel node biopsies: 2002/3, Salpingo oophorectomy 2002.  ACT x 14 mos. PMPS since nipple reconstruction, which included lift, in 2003.  Shooting, stabbing, searing breast pain bilaterally.  I have not slept through the night in 7 years.  I can no longer work full time--a real issue for a single mom with a 12 yo son. Also neuropathy: fingertips & feet & stomach (gastroparesis).  Permanent hot flashes.  Have tried absolutely everything, including PT, massage, yoga, acupuncture, rolfing, exercise, meditation...  Neurotin, cymbalta, lyrica, all kinds of opiods, ultram, NSAIDS, sleeping pills...  Nerve blocks, epidurals, lidoderm, capsaicum, topical ketamine...  (The only thing that I haven't tried is botox.  Haven't found anyone willing to treat.)  Have consulted with three major pain centers, including Sloan-Kettering.   This year, I decided to try everything again, in the hopes that my body would respond differently. So far, no changes.  I'm an advanced practice nurse, and teach undergraduate nursing, so I stay current on the research.  There's nothing out there for us.   I work hard to stay positive, but really--what a crappy life.",
