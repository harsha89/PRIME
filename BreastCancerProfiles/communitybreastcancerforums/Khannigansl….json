After the first three cycles I figured this out and did better when i took two collace in the morning and two in the evening, plus drinking SO much water. My daily goal was 100 ounces, though I always hit a minimum of 70 or 75 ounces. I dreaded drinking all that water and it never tasted good, but it helped my numbers stay in a good range and it helped me feel much better than the first three cycles when I wasn't taking so much collace and water. Best of luck.",
