I was going to cardiac rehab due to having 95% blockage of my LAD, due to radiation. One week after starting using the weights (only 3 pounds) my hand swelled up. I had a ring on and could not get it off. Went to physical therapist that helped me with cording and getting my shoulder back to normal. She did some manual decompression so we could get my ring off. WHEW! It was my Mother's ring my husband bought me after my 3rd baby. Â We went through many different sleeves/gloves/wrapping and nothing helped. She lent me a compression pump and had to pump for an hour a day and that is only thing that helps. Now I have a fitted sleeve/glove and also a night one that looks like a huge oven mit. Funny thing. My physical therapist (specializes in breast cancer patients) had never saw lymphedema present in the hand before me (in 20 years), but she has since seen 3 more patients with it. Your pictures lindalu53 look alot like my hand. I have to have a little padding on back of hand, under the glove/sleeve so there is a better flow of the fluid. If I didn't have that, my hand looks like those surgical gloves blown up. Between the Neurapathy that I have and the Lymphedema, I don't know which is worse. But, I am ALIVE. 2 year survivor of Inflammatory Breast Cancer.",
