      "Content": "Oct 11, 2014 12:20PM - edited Oct 11, 2014 12:23PM by nursiellp Boy, do I feel your pain.  Some history here.  I had a excisional biopsy in my early 20's that was a fibroid.   Years later they found some microcalcifications.  Had stereotactic biopsy.  It was benign.  Then next mammo had more microcalcifications and a cyst.  2 more stereotactic biopsies and an U.S guided biopsy.   All benign. I got so sick of these multiple biopsies that I just stopped getting mammos.   I would joke that my surgeon. was removing my right breast millimeter at a time.  Fast forward, THE LUMP.  It was very small, the size of a pea and I mentioned it to my medical Dr. and she wrote a script for screening mammo.  I thought awww, it's probably just a cyst and let it go, again.  Now a year later I am a menopausal 51 yr old and the lump grew tremendously in the past 3 months.  I also have skin thickening and it is attached to the skin of my areola.  You can actually see it . I know, I was stupid and I'm a nurse to boot.  I should have never let it go so long and frankly, I'm sick of my friends saying that.  I got a diagnostic mammo and they kept doing more and more views.  Then they sent me in for an U.S.  radiologist came in to do it  that took forever.  Had this happen before, no biggie.  The radiologist starts talking and I not only have this lump but 2 more suspicious microcalcifications and multiple cysts.  BI-RADS 4B.  So, I go the surgeon a week ago.  That morning I found another lump just above the big one.  Mammo says it's a cyst but I totally didn't feel it before.  I bring that up to the Dr.  Now, I know this Dr. well from previous biopsies and from my being a nurse at the hospital.  I start joking with him, as we also do, I said I've been falling all over the place in the past 3 months and actually fractured my wrist and I'm limping because I just fell on the way to his office.  I say \"So now I'm convinced that I not only have breast cancer, I have mets to the brain too!  lol\"  He looked at me over his glasses, straight faced and said \"lets just look at this first\".  Hit panic button!  I am scheduled on Wed for 2 stereotactic biopsies and then they're going to turn me around to have an excisional biopsy.  Since then I found 2 swollen, painful lymph nodes under my arm.  I have been differing to Dr. Google almost every waking moment..  I can't even watch my favorite TV shows because I can't pay attention that long.  I'm surprised that I could even write for this long on the subject but it's very therapeutic.  I absolutely am convinced that I have breast CA and MAYBE mets to the brain.  So, writesthings, after that long sob story, I have to say this. If you look at my history you will notice that I've had 4 stereotactic biopsies an US guided biopsy and an excisional biopsy and they were ALL BENIGN.  After 2 more stereotactic biopsies and another excisional biopsy I will probably be saying it again.  I know that a BI-RADS 4 is good news and nothing to panic about.  The rational thing is not to panic but it's your natural reaction to your body's fight or flight response.  The good thing is that the panic will stop when you get your results and you can either drop the whole sorry mess or the fight will come out like you've never seen before!. . Praying for you all.  It's the only thing to do right now besides panicking!    ",

All that being said I have a question.  He told me that there is no need to talk to a oncologist at this point because they won't know about the lymph node involvement until after surgery.  He said that the plan of care with oncology will be totally different.  I understand this but it came as a bit of a shock.   The first thing to pop into mind was I need an oncologist stat.  Is this a normal course of care?  Did you have the same assessment?   Just asking because you women at the pros at this! Writesthings, I will be following you closely because we seem to be diagnosed with just about the same thing at the same time.  I have become your new fan and I am your new stalker! LOL.  Hope to hear from you all soon.",
