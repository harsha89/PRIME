I'm 25 and at the beginning of April, I noticed a raised, hot, red bruise-like area on the left side of my left breast, a little bigger than a quarter I'd say. It was raised at the time in the middle, and did look like there was a clear point of entry like with a bug bite etc. It also had two white circles of flaky skin around it. I waited about a week to see if it would improve and when it didn't, went to see a couple of PCPs who both prescribed antibiotics. The swelling, size, and color started to improve after a few weeks so I felt a little reassured, and also saw my gyno twice in two weeks-she confirmed things were getting better. A couple of weeks later, I woke up feeling like my left breast was very warm. I went into a bit of a panic and my gyno ordered an US which came back negative, although very very mild skin thickening was noticed but no one seemed too concerned. Also saw my dermatologist who is great, her opinion on the redness was that as it wasn't getting any worse, it seemed benign and like it was resolving itself. A little after this I noticed what at first seemed like a deep stretch mark line under my left breast (I have tons of deep stretch marks on both breasts so wouldn't be abnormal), but then realize it seemed more like an indentation. I went to see a breast specialist at a great breast center and she thought the most likely scenario was a burst or ruptured cyst which initiated Mondor's. She said no chance of IBC in her opinion but obviously to come back sooner than a three-month follow up if things worsened. A week after this appointment I noticed I could feel the blue veins in my left breast like they were palpable, thick lines and it does feel like there is a thick line in the area of indentation too. It doesn't quite look like Mondor's photos I've seen online but I could see where there are similarities. I also have had some on and off pain in that breast and armpit but nothing I'd be bothered about if so much else wasn't happening. Anyway, as this has been going on for awhile and of course it's stressful I just thought I'd see if anyone had been in a similar position. Small red spot still there, but more just fading and hanging out-no change in texture in that area. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
