      "Content": "paradiseflower wrote: Can bone mets cause any symptoms when they are microscopic? Can you have pain from bone mets and have them not be seen on an xray? Please answer as soon as possible....... ....well let me tell you my concern. I am having bone pain in my upper left arm. Sometimes I can not lift it. My ribs, sternum, collarbone, and spine hurt as well. I have not been diagnosed with breast cancer. My xrays and bloodwork are all clear except for an elevated SED rate. I have deep breast pain and itching for 3 months now. My doctors refuse to give me an MRI since my mammos are all clear. I do have dense breasts and calcifications, but they are not concerned about that. I am so worried that something could be going wrong in my breasts, and now that I have these mysterious bone pains, I just do not know what to think. I know that many women have been diagnosed with bc because bone mets were found first. My bones hurt and burn, but nothing is showing on the xrays. What's a girl to do? Thanks and I hope everyone is doing well. Love Helen Soon, no resident will say, \"I am sick!\"- Isaiah 33:24. Log in to post a reply",

How much breast pain, breast itching, sternum pain, rib pain, thigh bone pain, spinal pain, arm pain do they need to get me a scan?!!!!.....On top of that, my foot bone breaks out of the blue! No trauma!!! I keep telling them that my arm hurts, I can't lift it........My sternum feel like it's going to crack, my ribs hurt......and on and on. Oh, no, they want to tell me it's hormones, fibromyalgia,  arthritis, or stress. I DON'T THINK SO CHARLIE!!!!! I am mad!!!! So now, the Rheumatologist they send me to, (because they think I have fibromyalgia), is pissed off because no one has done a scan or investigated my bone pain.....So he has ordered a bone scan to rule out any malignancy/cancer.......Thank you my Father! Now my breast is dimpling, and it is quite possible that I could be sitting here with advanced breast cancer! I have dense breast tissue, and my mammograms have always come back clear and so has my recent breast ultrasound that I had to demand be given. There are invasive, aggressive, demonic breast cancers that are out there ladies! And they are sneaky, and elusive. And they kill! So do not let anyone tell you just anything about your body!!!! Demand care. Do your homework! Cuz, I bet I know more about breast cancer than 10 so-called doctors, and I learned it all in the last 4 months, while trying to figure out what is wrong with me!!
