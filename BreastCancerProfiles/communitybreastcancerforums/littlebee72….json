Chemo and radiation will follow, but I just want this thing to be out of me. Good luck on your surgery and keep us all posted!",

I keep getting told that i will most likely need chemo and radiation but i dont understand why if there was no lymph node involvement and my margins were clean? I hope everyone who has had their surgery this month is doing well. Those with upcoming surgeries....good luck and lots of prayers!!",

Brittgirl, my biopsy didn't really hurt, it was a little uncomfortable when they inserted the titanium marker (there was a lot of pinching and burning), but it subsided quickly. I was told to use ice packs and take tylenol, but I really didn't need any of those. I don't think I have an abnormally high pain tolerance, but I did have 2 c-sections, so this was a cake walk compared to those! ",
