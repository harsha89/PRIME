I'm interested that your mom was able to take both together and had good results. That's great! I would guess that a 10 day break won't be detrimental. I think all the drugs stay in our systems a while, so 10 days should be just fine. Hoping for continued good results for your mom.",

Then either they pat it down themselves (they always call over a woman to do that part) or they ask me to pat it down myself while they watch, and then they swab my hands. No biggie. Wear your hat. If they ask you to remove it, feel confident about saying \"no thank you\". They'll figure out a way to make sure you're not a security risk without making you go bald through the airport. :) The only other bit of advice I have from my onc is to get up and walk/move at least once an hour during the flight (don't know how long your flight is). So many of the meds we're on can cause cramping and/or clots, so move when you are able. Have a great time!",

My cancer story: Diagnosed at stage IIb in 2008 at age 38 after finding a lump myself. Lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, started on tamoxifen, but only stayed on 2-1/2 years. 6 months after stopping, last fall, I noticed some nodes in my neck that were \"swelling\". Had biopsies and CT scan done that came back clear. My onc. was checking the nodes every 6 weeks and kept telling me they were nothing to worry about.  February was time for my yearly \"once-over\" workup, so he added another CT scan. This time it showed some \"problems\". I have mets in the nodes in my neck and sternum area, plus a bone scan showed mets in my spine and hips.  Just started last week on Zoladex (since I'm still premenopausal) and pamidronate injections. My oldest sister was diagnosed in September 2009 and passed away in June 2010 (way too fast!). At that time, I was offered genetic testing, and I'm BRCA2 positive too. My story otherwise: I have 2 terrific kiddos, ages 6 and 9, and I'm engaged to a great guy (who is, understandably, a bit shell-shocked, but still great).  I work full-time from my home. Currently in Ontario, but since my fiance lives in the US, we were (are?) planning to move there and get married... Everything seems like it's been cartwheeling out of control this past week, but having found you all here and spent some time browsing around, I'm feeling more calm already. I hate that we're all here, but so very glad to have found you.  Stay-at-home mom to 13-yo daughter and 11-yo son. stage iv, node and bone mets; 03/2013 liver mets; 05/2016 brain mets; hospice care.

I had a really hard time when I was dx'd with liver mets last year. Like you, I had sort of found my groove with living with bone mets and then, wham, something new. But, do you remember those very first weeks/months after your bone mets dx? When it felt like the world was caving in and life was over? And then you got a treatment plan in place and things started to normalize, right? That's how it will be this time too, if it turns out to be skin mets. It's going to be scary and crazy for a little bit until you get treatment in place and find your new groove. And you WILL find your new groove, just like you did after the bone mets were found. Try to breathe. One breath in, one breath out, and repeat. That's all you have to do for right now. Wait for the biopsy results before you get to a full-on panic -- otherwise you might be wasting precious otherwise-happy moments filled up with worry for something that's no more than an infected pimple.  More hugs.

Now, after 10 cycles I have red, hot, dry, sore hands and feet pretty much all the time. Days 12-14 of the cycle, I have some trouble walking because my feet are so painful, but as soon as I start the 7 day break, I get relief almost immediately. That is the worst of the s/e's for me. No nausea or tummy troubles. I'm tired and need a nap most days, but nothing unmanageable. But, as I said, my liver mets are completely gone, and the mets in my bones and lymph nodes are smaller than they were at my last scan in October. The side effects are well worth the good work Xeloda is doing on the cancer. I hope that if you have to start Xeloda, it will be great for you too.",

My cancer story: Diagnosed at stage IIb in 2008 at age 38 after finding a lump myself. Lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, started on tamoxifen, but only stayed on 2-1/2 years. 6 months after stopping, last fall, I noticed some nodes in my neck that were \"swelling\". Had biopsies and CT scan done that came back clear. My onc. was checking the nodes every 6 weeks and kept telling me they were nothing to worry about.  February was time for my yearly \"once-over\" workup, so he added another CT scan. This time it showed some \"problems\". I have mets in the nodes in my neck and sternum area, plus a bone scan showed mets in my spine and hips.  Just started last week on Zoladex (since I'm still premenopausal) and pamidronate injections. My oldest sister was diagnosed in September 2009 and passed away in June 2010 (way too fast!). At that time, I was offered genetic testing, and I'm BRCA2 positive too. My story otherwise: I have 2 terrific kiddos, ages 6 and 9, and I'm engaged to a great guy (who is, understandably, a bit shell-shocked, but still great).  I work full-time from my home. Currently in Ontario, but since my fiance lives in the US, we were (are?) planning to move there and get married... Everything seems like it's been cartwheeling out of control this past week, but having found you all here and spent some time browsing around, I'm feeling more calm already. I hate that we're all here, but so very glad to have found you.  Stay-at-home mom to 13-yo daughter and 11-yo son. stage iv, node and bone mets; 03/2013 liver mets; 05/2016 brain mets; hospice care.

At home, I let my daughter take some time for herself, doing something away from her brother (who is usually the source of her irritation) and just get some space. When they are at school, there's nothing I can do. I just tell her she is going to have people throughout her life who get on her nerves and make her crazy. She needs to start now to figure out how to deal with it on her own when I'm not there and she can't get some space. My nephew, who used to live with us, has Down Syndrome. He's 30, but operates at roughly at 7-year-old level and, though not autistic, will repeat the same \"jokes\" over and over if it gets a laugh the first time, etc. Redirecting him to a different activity or even just a different topic of conversation usually helps too. But when it comes down to it, we can't expect to change other people; only our reactions to them. That's something that your 12-year-old is not too young to learn. Good luck.",

This is going to be a scary time, but once your mom gets started on a treatment program, there's every chance that she will improve. There are stories of women living 10 or 20 years with bone mets. There's no reason that couldn't be your mom's story too. The stage iv forum here has a thread for questions, and there is a good caregivers forum too. You might want to check in there once you have more information. Hang in there.",

When I was diagnosed stage iv in April of 2012, my doctor told me median survival was 2 years and I shouldn't expect more time than that. I seriously considered just curling up in a ball and waiting to die. But I didn't. I moved across the continent with my children, got married to a wonderful man and created a new life (with a new medical team!) in California. In the past 3 years I've seen my children grow and blossom, we've made amazing memories and life has been good -- even with chemo and se's thrown in the mix. But it still shocks me, somehow, that I'm 45 years old. I honestly, in some part of my being, never expected to find myself at this birthday milestone. So, as the saying goes (sort of), I've come a long way baby. Let's see just how much further I can go!

I was surprised by the idea of another scan too - especially since I just had one less than a month ago, but the onc says if it's flaring up in my breast, she wants to know where else it's flaring up too, before we go any further. We'll see what the next week brings.  Thanks for listening. :)",

I was in the church choir during my first run with chemo and I mentioned to the choir director that I thought I would take a break from choir because I wouldn't feel comfortable at the front of the church the way I looked. He took it to the rest of the choir and they decided, as a group, that if it would make me feel better up there, they would all shave their heads too! I said it wasn't necessary, but it did show me just how much they cared about me feeling comfortable and the lengths they would go to to help me. It was a moment I'll always remember. But, strangers wearing bald caps for charity? That's just stupid. I don't get all the Facebook petitions about the bald Barbie to make little girls feel better either.  How does it help, exactly? For me, all it does is remind me of this damn disease, especially in those too brief moments when I may have been able to put it out of my mind.",

In my own case, I was on tamoxifen for about 9 months, progressing all the while. Then we tried letrozole/Femara and I progressed on that too, so now I'm onto a chemo. Once things are under control, I'll probably go back to the hormonals again. Hormonals tend to be easier on us, so they are used before jumping to harsher treatments. The first few months after diagnosis are hard, but once there is a treatment plan in place things should get easier. Good luck to you both.",

But what breaks my heart every single day is knowing that I will be leaving my children behind to grow up without me. And being BRCA2+ to boot, means that there is a good chance that one or both of them will also have to fight this battle themselves when they are older, without the support and love of their mother to help them through. I love my kids and can't even imagine my life without them, but if I could turn back time and change one thing, I'm not sure I would ever have brought them into this world if I knew then that this is how my life would play out. I can't bear to think of the hurt that I will cause them and the void that will be left in their lives. Emotions aside, though, I'm lucky that my kids are in school full-time. I can't imagine having to sort out childcare arrangements for every single appointment and treatment. Being a mom is exhausting on its own. Add the cancer exhaustion level to that... whew. I hope you don't feel that I'm lecturing. I just wanted to let you know how it is for me. I hope that you can find the answers that work for you. Sending you strength and peace.",

I'm currently on anti-hormonals only. I got my Canadian doctor to give me an extra couple of months' worth of my tamoxifen and scheduled my luperon and pamidronate for as close to my departure time as possible. Then I got a new doctor here as soon as I arrived and got started with treatment again in just a few weeks. The move went well. I'm happy with my new medical team, and very happy to be living my life to the fullest instead of putting my life on hold with the status quo and waiting for the end to come.

She's hoping that the lump will start to behave itself and not get much bigger while we wait a few more weeks to see what the Femara is going to do (hopefully, good things!).  If that's not the case and the lump continues to balloon, I'm to call her at the beginning of next week -- she'll schedule another PET scan and a biopsy to make sure we really know what we're dealing with and then, likely, some chemo to try to get this runaway train under control.

I get my teeth cleaned and a checkup with my dentist every 6 months and have been on bisphosphonates for more than 2 years now. You need to let your dentist know what meds you are on, but, as far as I understand, surface work like that is no problem. Even fillings should be fine. The problem would be if they needed to go below the gum line (ie root canal, extractions, etc).",

      "Content": "kebab wrote: I'm frustrated with my stupid leg/lack of mobility. Just venting... I'm only 3 weeks since my stage iv dx. I feel fine. Actually, since starting the Zoladex, I feel better than I have in months. The pain in my neck and between my shoulder blades (that I thought was stress/stiff muscles/tension, but turned out to be neck/spine mets) is gone. For the first time since Christmas, I can look over my shoulder!  But my left hip/leg has gone dowhill, fast.  I'm suddenly walking with a cane, at age 40! What kind of crap is this? If I didn't have people constantly asking about the cane/my limp, I wouldn't have to explain my health at all. I'm on oxycodone and gabapentin, and sometimes get relief if I take 1 pill of each, both at the same time. More than 100 mg at a time of gabapentin makes my leg muscles seize up completely and I can barely move. More than 1 oxy just makes me too stoned to function. But the 2 together seems to loosen something up and give me a bit easier mobility for a short time. I complained enough to my onc. and he set me up with radiation. I got one shot to my left femur on Thursday and I am scheduled for a shot to the back of the hip this week. No change yet from the first zap though.  I really have a feeling it's more like something pinched in my low back that is causing the problem. If I concentrate and go slowly, I can put my leg/hip through a full range of motion. The muscles are tight, but the will move. I just can't put any weight on it. Stepping onto my left leg sends pain down into my knee and sometimes my ankle. I can stand on both feet with no pain and no trouble, but if I lift my right foot off the floor, I fall over to the left. No balance at all. And sometimes when I step with my left foot, even with the cane, my hip just sort of \"buckles\" and I stumble. I'm really glad my doctors are so eager to fight my \"pain\" with drugs and rads, but I can't get them to understand that this isn't so much a pain issue... I don't know where else to turn.  Normally, I would head to my chiropractor, but he \"fired\" me after learning I have spine mets. Doesn't want to \"mess\" with that. Physiotherapy? Acupuncture? I'm terrified to try anything not suggested by my onc, for fear of messing things up more than they already are. Anybody ever have issues like this? Or suggestions of what to try next? I can get my head around this diagnosis but I cannot get my head around walking with a cane for the rest of whatever time I have left. Not acceptable!

I have learned that my fiance's health care plan, which will cover me for any treatment I need, doesn't cover any \"end of life\" care. No in-home care, etc. It covers hospice, but there are limited beds available and it's in a city 60 miles from our home. The numbers he got were that out of pocket, in-home care would likely run about $5-6K per month. I am hoping that this is a long way off for me (for all of us!), but I'm a planning kind of girl. I need to know how things are going to go. So, I'm wondering if this lack of insurance coverage is normal in the US or how other people deal with this stuff. I know that there is long-term insurance, but with already having a stage IV dx, I'd guess it's a bit late to get onboard with that. What do people do when it comes to end of life care?

I thought regression was tumors shrinking. NED and remission I would use interchangeably for no measurable cancer activity anywhere.  Honestly, I just can't use the word \"cure\" for breast cancer. I think people get good long periods of NED/remission, but once it's in the body it's just too easy for it to lie dormant for a while and then rear its ugly head again sometime down the road.  There is no cure for breast cancer. I cringe every time I hear someone say they are cured -- not because I'm not happy for them. I certainly am! -- but because that is the word that their listeners latch onto and then expect all of us to be cured... and then we're not... and somehow it's our own fault (didn't eat enough lemons and baking soda maybe?), because they know so-and-so who had breast cancer and was \"cured\".  People (perhaps the one originally mentioned in this thread) who state that they have survived (past tense) stage iv breast cancer make me cringe for the same reason. I'm certainly happy for them, but their words just seem to make it that much harder for the rest of us to make the reality of our situation understood. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.",

Those wired for it will be triggered somehow, by something, and those not wired for it can be exposed to the same triggers and be just fine. That makes sense to me. Partially genetic and partially environmental. But those of us \"wired\" for it can't spend our lives living in a bubble, can we? There are just sooooo many possible triggers, it boggles the mind -- the food we eat, water we drink, air we breathe, clothing we wear, etc. I go back to my \"crap shoot\" theory.",

Seriously, I have been in tears this week thinking about how wonderful it would be to get to see her \"before I die\" (... granted, it's scan week for me, so emotions are running a bit high anyway...). I think seeing her perform live might really be the only thing on my bucket list. I'm interested to see the sorts of things other people have on their lists too.

They know about the spread. They know I am in treatment and will be forever, but we haven't discussed the end of the road, as it were, or how long \"forever\" might be.

I don't think any celebrity is obligated to share any details or specifics about their disease. I know many of us here have kept our stage iv status on a need-to-know basis with people in our lives. Why should we expect otherwise from celebrities? I think they're entitled to keep their specifics to themselves. It's their health, they can be as private as they want. Though I understand the need to come out with a statement, because if someone were to take a photo with them looking less than stellar, it wouldn't take long for rumors to start. Best to get the info about their diagnosis out there. I get that. It's when they start spouting the tired old pink rhetoric that drives a spike through my heart. Just say you have been diagnosed and you're in treatment, and move on. Fine. But shut the heck up then. Don't start spewing about how early detection has saved your life or how your going to start a crusade to get mammos for every woman on the planet or how you're going to be cured. Just don't. That's where the celebrity speeches lose me.",

I would recommend letting it come to room temp or at least taking it out of the refrigerator for even 15-20 minutes before. When it's cold, you feel it going in. Not that it's painful, but why make it any more unpleasant than it needs to be? I don't know how long you'll be on it, but for me the effects were cumulative -- barely any side effects from the first set of shots, but increasing pain in my thigh bones with each cycle. By cycle 8, I could barely walk without feeling like my femurs were going to snap... but on the positive side, after a couple of my \"rest\" days had passed, the SEs subsided each time. Within a week of finishing the last cycle, the bone pain was completely gone. I can't remember any other side effects specifically.  Hope that helps.",

Normally it will infuse over 30 minutes, but after the 7th infusion it should be reduced to go in over 2 or more hours, to try to reduce the possibility of a reaction. (I just had my 11th infusion pumped in over 30 minutes. When I said I was suddenly hot and had itchy hands and feet, THEN I learned about the possibility of reaction... not impressed...)

My TMs are up just a smidge but are still half of what they were when I started the trial, so I'm going to look at that as positive news. The reports from the bone and CT scans arrived in my inbox within 24 hours and seemed to say (to my eyes at least) that all is still stable, aside from \"mass in rt breast 2.8 x 1.8 x 2.7 cm (previous measurement 2.6 x 1.5 x 2.1 cm)\". This is the same mass that I was blissfully ignoring for an entire year (while in tx for stage iv) because it didn't show up on my PET scans and my regular onc was assuring me was nothing to worry about. I got on the trial, it shows up on CT, and suddenly we're calling it a tumor. Sigh. Anyway, the trial onc has asked to review the actual scans herself this time so I'm delivering the CD to her today. I think I'm allowed a 30% progression from baseline to remain in the trial. Fingers are Firmly crossed that it's less than that and I can continue. Thanks for being here, hanging out in the waiting room and sharing your support. I can't tell my friends or family how scared I am, but you all just get it. I appreciate all of you!",

      "Content": "Jun 11, 2014 08:30PM - edited Jun 11, 2014 08:33PM by kebab Welcome to the forums. :) I think Peterborough has a fairly decent oncology department. When I was doing my ATC chemo, I went on vacation in that area and my own onc was very happy that I'd be near the Peterborough hospital should anything go wrong while I was away from home, as he was confident they could take good care of me. Also, you are going to be spending a lot of time at the hospital while you are in treatment. For me, I was at the hospital at least 2 days every 2 weeks. You are going to feel crappy and be tired. That 2 hour drive between Peterborough and Toronto is going to become miserable really, really fast. That's just my opinion though. You need to do what feels right to you, and we will support you in your decision. As for the possibility of the spot on your spine, try not to worry until you know for sure that there is something to worry about. You have enough on your plate just now. You don't need to think about the what-ifs until you get more information. Sending you strength. hrm. edited to add: It may seem out of left field that I'm talking about Peterborough but my profile says California.... I lived in the Kitchener/Waterloo area when I was first diagnosed and treated.",

I'm hoping that either my mom or my sister will be able to come and stay with us right at the end, so the kids can be with me til the end. I try not to think about it too much. There are too many what ifs involved. I think the craziest part of the disease is knowing we are going to die too soon, but not knowing if it might be 6 months or 6 years down the line. It throws a real wrench in the ability to plan anything.

If Xeloda is what you will be on, check out the All about Xeloda thread here. Tons of tips in there for dealing with the various side effects. But the good news is that Xeloda is pretty well tolerated and does really great work for a lot of people.  I ended my time on Xeloda after about a year and my liver mets came back, but so far, I'm not sick and jaundiced and weak and all the other things I thought would go along with liver mets.
