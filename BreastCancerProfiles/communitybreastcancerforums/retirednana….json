      "Content": "retirednana wrote: this is the third year i have chosen to have a 3D annual screening. I have been scheduled an ultrasound for \u201cpossible mass Inferior left breast 6cm from nipple\". I am quite worried since I was told the 3D was quite accurate. I am 62 with very small breasts,heterogenously dense. I cannot feel a lump. How often are false positives from the 3D mammogram and how can a mass be 6 cm in a very small Breast? Also, what does \u201cinferior\u201d mean on this test I still have 8 days until my ultrasound. Log in to post a reply",
