In and out of the hospital in less than 6 hours and have had little to no discomfort other than some tenderness. Lumpectomy and SNB completed, my surgeon was optimistic he got clear margins, but he is naturally optimistic - nice to hope that will be the case. Waiting in the pathology report which will come online through my hospital's medical records portal. I took the week off from work and am glad for the down time but am feeling good and staying active with walks, going out to eat with friends, a few art projects getting completed. Hoping everyone else with surgery this month is doing well and gets the rest they need for the next step in this process. Anne",
