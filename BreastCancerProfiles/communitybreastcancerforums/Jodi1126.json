Both biopsy locations came back with \"Breast tissue comprised predominantly of dense stromal fibrosis. Negative for epithelial atypia or malignancy.\" My primary care doctor was shocked and happy, as was I. Anyone with a BI-RAD 5 ultrasound result know what it's like to wait for the impending 95% chance of a malignant result, so hearing this was shocking and wonderful all at the same time. I am 57 yrs old with multiple risk factors. My mother was a 22 year survivor of BC having had it in each breast, 5 years apart. I am an Ashkenazi Jew, progesterone deficient, no children, birth control pills starting at age 16, smoked until 10 years ago, and have had some major stressors in my life the past 8 years. I have 2 questions: Has anyone here ever received a negative biopsy result with a BI-RADS 5 diagnosis and gotten a second opinion from another pathologist? Has anyone decided, after a scare like this, with high risk factors like mine gotten the BRCA 1&2 genetic tests? Thank You in Advance, Jodi Log in to post a reply",

The same radiologist recommended only 2 of the masses for core biopsies that resulted in a Negative path result citing dense stromal fibrosis, which was discordant with the ultrasound reading. Further core and surgical biopsies were recommended by the breast surgeon at that hospital. I had all images and biopsy slides / blocks sent to another hospital for a second opinion. The path report there cited atypical lobular hyperplasia. I found out today that the second radiologist diagnosing from the original images from the first hospital stated BI_RADS 0. Both the second radiologist and the second breast surgeon have recommended MRI, plus further ultrasounds and possibly core biopsies that I have scheduled for this Monday. I am very high risk with a mother having bilateral BC before age 50, very dense breasts, no children and am an Ashkenazi Jew so a full genetic panel is also being done (sent off today). I am 57 years old. OK so I have been muddling through this for, going on, 6 weeks which has been making me crazy, but finding out today about the GIGANTIC discrepancy between the two radiologist's findings of BI-RADS 5 and BI-RADS 0 is the straw that has broken the camel's back. I know I just have to wait for all the results, which I can do, BUT Does anyone have any idea why there would be such a huge difference in the BI-RADS readings????
