I have to wait another two weeks to get an MRI and then will have surgery soon after that. It's my underdstanding that even if you decide to have a lumpectomy, depending on what they find, you may still have to have a mastectomy. Have you had an MRI yet? That should give your surgeon (and you) a better picture of what you're dealing with and what you have to do. I'm with you in wanting this out of me, YESTERDAY! Enjoy Hawaii!",

If any of the mammos, ultrasounds, or 3 MRIs had shown a speck in the L, I would have gone BMX without hesitation. Thinking about it now two months later, even with no family history of BC, I almost wish I had done the BMX from the beginning so I wouldn't have to worry so much about possibly having to go through this all again.

I had 5 needles of nuclear medicine injected into my breast before my lumpectomy and my BS injected blue dye (to mix with the nuclear medicine) during surgery to be able to determine the path fluid drains from my breast. The BS follows that path to see which/how many nodes could be involved. Although the BS has a pretty good idea at the time of surgery, you won't know for sure until final pathology comes back. Hope this answer helped a little :)",

On the recommendation of a friend, I also went to a second BS (who I liked so much better than the first). I haven't had surgery yet because I want to have all the infomation possible to make the right decision for me. I had an MRI yesterday and have to return on Monday for an ultrasound for a \"suspicious\" spot in the same breast. If this spot is cancer, and they are too far apart from each other to have a lumpectomy, then I will have to have a MX. My BS also suggested I meet with a RO to discuss radiation options (possible intraoperative radiation). Hopefully surgery will happen within the next two weeks (@1 1/2 months after dx). After surgery I will meet with MO to discuss further treatment. I want the cancer out ASAP, and the waiting is really hard, but glad I didn't rush into any decisions regarding surgery! I was in the same boat as you...knowing very little about cancer. Since finding this site, I have become empowered and feel like I can ask my doctor important questions and be able to understand the answers too! :)",
