The hysterectomy pathology report showed atypia and polyps grown since the January D & C but no cancer present and no need for follow up other than a pap test each year for a bit til that is fine and then can skip it, re the breast tests - no need to go back til October for a follow up bilateral U/S - i feel like i just picked up the \"get out of jail free\" card. tomorrow i go to see the onc and get the prescription for Arimidex. i am recovering nicely from the hysterectomy and seems like peace will reign in my life for a bit. off to a job interview tomorrow so can go with my mind at rest hugs to you all and thanks so much for your kind words of support Barbara Dx 8/7/2005, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/11 nodes, ER+ Log in to post a reply",
