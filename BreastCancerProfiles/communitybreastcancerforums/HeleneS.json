Tamoxifen doesn't allow the estrogen to latch onto any floating tumor molecules, while ovarian suppression affects the production of estrogen.  My intermediate score concerned me which is why I advocated for more than Tamoxifen.  My onc and a second opinion onc said they wouldn't even have sent for the oncotype test because my tumor was so small (they're not concerned about the 23 score). I requested that the oncotype be done.",

No chemo, but am on Tamoxifen and Lupron.  Had one infusion of Zometa and got very sick.  I'm 43 and am done having babies. My onc who has vaccillated in her opinion over the last year told me yesterday that she feels I'm being overtreated since my tumor was so small and I had the bilateral she's recommending dropping the Lupron and Zometa. The Lupron has given me se's and am on Effexor for the hot flashes. I sometimes fear that I'm doing myself more harm than good.  Would appreciate any opinions.  are any of you ladies on Lupron and for how long?",
