Its a quick process but I do want to warn you that for the few seconds that the dye is being injected (they go in right by the nipple) it is quite painful. I took a deep breath and blew hard out through my mouth until the pinching feeling subsided. You should be fine immediately afterwards. Good luck for tomorrow and Ill be sending warm and fuzzy thoughts your way on Wednesday morning.",

I was still breathing out hard when she laughed and said 'its already out' so no pain for me. (at least on the that side ) Still got one more to go. Everyone heals so differently. Good luck. ",

I begged for some pain meds but was only allowed 1 vicodin in the nine hours post op. Two days later the qball was removed and they discovered it hadn't released any meds. No one had checked it. I hear its great when it works but make sure its actually working!",

Since leaving the hospital Ive had a constant, cramping, throbbing pain in my right hand that sometimes travels to my elbow. I believe it is coming from the site of the IV but when I told my surgeon about it he didnt see why it would cause a lasting pain. He also ruled out lymph edema because there is no obvious swelling. Im unable to grip a steering wheel, hold a fork or tie my shoes. I am due to return to work (as a hairdresser) on Tuesday but dont think Im going to make it in my present condition. Any thoughts? Any one have a similar experience? chili Dx 3/5/2008, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, 1/4 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
