I actually had a biopsy done on same breast (left) 1 1/2 years ago which came back as benign... It all started with micro calcifications on mammo...anyway... met with surgeon after results came back and he sent me to an oncologist..I thought that the oncologist was going to tell me what kind of treatment I was going to need but he just reviewed my path report and is actually waiting for my estrogen test to come in. He said that he will consult with my surgeon and I will hear from them by end of this week....Feel like I am in the middle of a fog..I am walking around half there...My husband, kids 20,16,8, all are very supportive and my friends are trying to be positive but I feel like I am walking around trying to make this easier on them....then I get mad at people who tell me this is not a cancer or who are trying to act like nothing is wrong. I know they are just trying to help but I am getting kind of angry, then I feel guilty for getting angry! Oh well! My best friend Pam says to heck with worrying about hurting others feelings, I need to worry about me for once..I know other moms can relate to this! Well enough of venting...more of my DX... I have dcis involving multiple foci and focally closely approaches the biopsy margins...I know I will have to have some sort of surgery and am trying not to stress out on which path to choose. It really helps to read everyones story re dcis.I know I am not alone with this disease. I will say a prayer for everyone and will write back when I get more info.  Thanks and hugs to everyone",
