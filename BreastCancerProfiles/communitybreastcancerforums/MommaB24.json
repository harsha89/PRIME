If I don't get chemo and go straight to rads, the PS won't be able to fill the right TE because of the damage to the tissue. So at this point, I'm praying for chemo (wait, what?) so they can push through my fills prior to rads. The RO says I need to be doing some sort of therapy chemo/rads/hormone blockers to keep any stray cancer cells from growing. I'm still adjusting to the fact that I have cancerüòï This can be so overwhelming at times",

Surprised after March 3 surgery to discover one measured 13 cmüò± Still waiting on oncotype, but I know radiation is in my future. Still trying to wrap my head around the craziness. Lymph nodes were negative as well as bone scan. Waiting to get CT scan next. Nice to know I'm not alone",

I'm over a month out and haven't had a fill. Get my external stitches out next Friday and my first fill. Saw the RO on Friday. Said he wants to radiate my right chest wall and lymph nodes. Catch 22, I haven't had fills yetüòï So now I'm hoping I need chemo or I won't be able to use these silly TE's. Two steps forward, three steps back. Getting my CT scan on Monday. It's a blessing to share this journey with you all. This sometimes feels like a lonely road",
