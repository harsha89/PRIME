    "Content": "autumnW wrote: I'm also going thru the terrified stage.  Scheduled for a biopsy on Monday.  Doesnt look good.  My husband and I are meeting up with our son who just got back from Iraq.  Meeting him mid next week.  This is really a down, down time for us (except for the fact HE is BACK).  Six years ago one of our daughters was killed in an auto accident this same time of year.  I hate the waiting for the results and yet have specifically already requested my breast doctor to not give me the results until we return and he is gone.  I dont want to ruin this precious week with him (anymore than the stress of not knowing) and will try my best to make it a good one.  I have to get my head around all of this before I can \"hit\" my kids with this, particularly right now.  Bad enough my poor hubby has to deal with it.  We were so hoping 2010 would be a better year...2009 was the pits...prostate cancer and quadruple bypass for hubby.  Just felt the need to vent to others who would know....Wishing I could live in a Xanax haze for a while although once I know I can get my ducks in a row (although you all know I have kind of done that already...glass half empty)  Wishing for strength for the next couple of weeks....then I'll deal with it (I hope).
