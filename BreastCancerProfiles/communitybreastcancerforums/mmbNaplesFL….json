And diarrhea, extreme for a week. Started back on probiotics, fermented ginseng, mastic root and digestive enzymes as supplements. Eating sauerkraut, green smoothies, kefir, whole milk organic yogurt. Took a solid week to start helping, felt much better after two weeks. Continue to lose weight though. Down about six pounds.  ",

I go for simulation on Friday the 4th and will probably start treatment next week. I had bmx on 05 July and still recovering from very invasive surgery through almost up to under collar bone to remove scar tissue from tumor wrapped around my brachial artery/vein/nerve roots. My RAD will be directing my treatment to that area and he didn't mention any in the breast area, so I'm a bit confused on all, that from what I have read here. I'm grat duo for the green tea regimen recipe and instructions and will order emu oil today, I guess. I was planning on using bio oil. My treatments will be 5/week for five weeks. Sounds daunting as I will be 2-1/2 hours from home -- going to tampa as that is where my BS was done and surgeon wants RAD he recommends to do treatment. I will stay in the Hope Lodge. Sounds like a long time but other than 10+ (probably) years of HT, I hope to be done with treatments soon. I was DX mid Jan with five months of chemo first to shrink tumors. I pray each day for all going through this very tough illness and pray that an easier form of treatment will become to light soon and/or that no more women will get this terrible disease",

My RO told me that women who have breasts at radiation have less chance of skin burn than those of us who have lost our breast. I am at 12/28 treatments. My chest is definately red at center of breast area, close to breastbone. Not noticing any red under arm or at collarbone where RAD is also directed. I have use the green tea treatments every day starting at day one. I don't notice the pads pulling out any heat. My chest is just skin and bone, no fleshy padding at all. Does that make a difference? thanks for your help /mmb ",

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2018 03:57PM - edited Apr 4, 2018 04:04PM by mmbNaplesFL I started FemarA mid Oct 2017 and then started a Clinical Trial which added Afinitor (10mg/day,) mid Nov2017 I wa doing well until late Jan/early Feb when the fatigue became unbearable. By mid Feb I was worried I had pneumonia. After several tests (x-ray, CT, PET/CT) all my doctors think I am fine. I finally had to insist I take a break from Afinitor as I was just a big, sore blob. Spent most of my day in bed. Too many SE. Six days off the afinitor I feel much better. I have agreed to try 5mg dose per day but not the full dose or I have to leave the trial. I am waiting to see if trial will allow that dose. I am stage III b-c ( don't know which) and the trial is to see if the afinitor can keep us stage III girls from gettingmets. Aside from huge fatigue, I have lung (breathing issues) numbness in fingertips and right hand, red spots under skin on chest and forearms, joint pain. I know no one can decide for me, but for you with mets, would you have gone through this for a year for the chance to maybe avoid mets? It is like going through the five months of chemo again, wherein I spent most of my time in bed between doses, with maybe a good day or two in between This is constant and I worry about the long term effects of the toxicity. The clinical trial is for one year, so I would need to take until mid Nov 2018 Of course, it will take years for anyone to make an assessment of its efficacy, so that's not really a consideration at this point. I have agreed for them to use all of my Info for all of the research, in hopes of future progress of course. Many thanks if you have any advice for me. Michele PLEASE excuse if I have violated policy by submitting this question and not being stage IV",

      "Content": "Apr 27, 2018 04:08PM - edited Apr 27, 2018 04:31PM by mmbNaplesFL Has anyone with PMPS seen any link between FemarA and the pain syndrome? I began FemarA last year, Oct 11. Two months later, mid December, I developed PMPS and started seeing a Pain Dr. Got two cervical and one thoracic nerve block, which have pretty much worn off. I was due to see Dr this month but am in Denver until mid May. My pain has gotten pretty bad again and pain meds don't help. I inadvertently forgot to take my FemarA and supplements last night and today I feel SO MUCH better. That is the only time I have missed a dose. Could the nerve craziness and resultant pain be tied somehow to the FemarA? I intend to not take it again tonight and see if I have further improvement. I don't intend to stay off the FemarA for good, but just hoping that if the syndrome can calm down maybe I can get rid of it. Is this just wishful thinking? Is there another drug that does what FemarA does that I may be able to switch to? I am under the impression that FemarA is the best, so this will be a major problem for me. My pain has been so bad it has been ruining my life. Don't want to do anything except be still so I don't hurt so much. I do exercise, do yoga, stretches, warm baths that all help for a while, but the debilitating pain returns. I only long for nighttime so I can get in bed and feel better . This is no way to live. Hope to hear if anyone else has any experience with these issues. THX so much, Michele",
