I never used makeup as i do now but it makes ME feel better. Back in Aug. , when i got my first wig , i was given a gel filled (sorry, chemo brain ) it's about 16\" long and 1\" wide. It's filled with gel so you can put in refridge to cool. It has velcro( that took me 3 min to think of the word) you wrap it around your head and it helps keep you cool and holds the wig in place. Nolana-There is a woman that gets chemo the same time i do and she lost her eyelashes. She lined her eyelid with dark pencil and it really made a difference. Hope everyone has a good day Chris",

I have OV at 9:00 and then 3rd chemo right after. I  keep telling myself that after morrow only 1 more to go. Yeh.....It's been a long 9 months to date.

I spoke to ONC about insurance co charging me $45 for each neupogen shot and they won't budge. I asked about getting neulesta instead and dealing with the pain if it will not cost me. She gave me a prescription for 2 shots to take to pharmacy. They went into computer to check the cost. It is 8000.00 per shot. They checked with ins co and was told i had to call them as this exceeded my limit. Well, i guess i'll pay the $45 for each shot. Thank heavens i only have 8 shots to get. I can't believe i'm still not tired yet. This would be the worst time for me to take a nap.I'm going to take two sleeping pills at once before i go to bed tonight and hopefully they will knock me out. Chris",

My onc said it will probably be 8 weeks cuz you don't get treatments on the weekends. I'll be receiving rad right next to the hospital which is 5 min from my house.I wish you clear and light thoughts.

Went to the condo with contractor buddy for his advice on what we want to do there.Bummed us out on one major idea but i came up with another that he said was ok. Went and ordered the kitchen cabinets with the new measurements. Looked at appliances and then decided to buy all new for our house and take ours to the condo as they aren't really old, 5yrs. I picked out paint colors for some rooms but i have a question, what color do i paint a bedroom . I heard some colors are supposed to be soothing. I was gonna go ecru. Everything in fl is white, white, white. Have any of you craved milk? I drink it all day. Mostly on the decadron but it must be three weeks of craving it. Aurora- My bp is usually 112/58 but on the decadron i can go up to 173/90. Goodluck on your taxes. My cpa had me keep mileage, receipts (bra tank top for chemo) and all medical payouts,insurance premiums for the year and medicines and wigs.
