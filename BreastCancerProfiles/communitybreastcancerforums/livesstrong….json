He was self employed so we had no money coming in.  By the time he recovered he lost the business and continued to be out of work for another 2 years.  We survived on cash advances and wound up being tens of thousands of $'s in debt. Fast forward to last year when I ws dx.  Fortunately, I was able to collect SDI.  But we still continue to struggle.  Looking back, we should have made an attempt to get help.  Why don't you try contacting your mortgage co. & credit cards and letting them know your situation.  I have read where they are willing to work with people in these types of situations.

The Neulasta really helped keep my counts up so I could continue treatment.  I was on several anti-nausea med's which were a GOD send.  The only thing I really had trouble with was fatigue. I just wanted you all to know that it is doable and if you have any ?'s feel free to ask. I found your hunting stories incredible.  My DH used to bowhunt until he was dx with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma several years back.  He stopped. Mentally, he just couldn't do it anymore. Funny, how we're all so different. Hang in there ladies, I'll check back often. Valerie",

I was thinking - maybe one of these weekends you could fly to NYC and we could meet. Nancy - how about it?  Let me know.  Hugs, AE",

We went and saw our onky yesterday about UB's scan.  It seems bootface never really disappeared from the last treatment, in fact it got a tiny bit bigger plus it showed some other spots near his lungs as well.  Now keep in mind lymphoma is different from other bootfaces.  The onky told us UB will never be \"cured\".  He will be in remission for lengths of time but it probably will always come back.  They treat it like a chronic disease, like diabetes (can you believe it)!  Anyway, UB told him he has  had a dull ache near his kidney and has had shortness of breath (I didn't know this),  SO the bottom line is the onky wants to wait 3 weeks and if Bill still doesn't feel good they will start chemo - again.  With lymphoma there is always the possibility of bootface shrinking so thats why he wants to wait. So that's about it from here - MORE WAITING!!!  Love you all - Karen - I'm thrilled about your Mom.  Cathi - looks like we'll wait together. AE",

Judy - your art work is fabulous!!!  I LOVE it.  I must look into doing that.  I also read Marley & Me - I LOVED IT!!!  I could sooooo relate.  I thought it was very well written.  Did you know they are making it into a movie?  Jennifer Anniston is playing the wife. I am currently reading  The Dogs of Bedlam Farm by Jon Katz.  He is a writer that lived in Jersey but moved to upstate NY and bought a farm.  It's about life on the farm with 3 border collies and an assortment of farm animals and the bonds that form between the animals and the author. My favorite reads are anything with animals but I also love biographies.  Just finished an oral one on John Lennon. Sue - sounds like you are going thru the \"is that it?\" stage right now.  We have all been there.   Everything ends so abruptly, you feel like there should be something else happening to you.  Well there is, its called getting back to the life you once had. It's time to put this all behind you and head back to Kansas, young lady!!! But Judie is right - what kind of adventure do you have in store for us next?? We need to stay connected somehow. Well I started sanding and staining my chairs today - best get back to it. bbl, AE ",

Karen - glad to hear you Dad is better. Sorry, can't watch the video if its about animals and going to make me cry!! Mel - my colonoscopy was a breeze.  The stuff I had to drink was nasty but I hear they have pills now you can take. Just an FYI - I took some colon cleanse pills for a week beforehand so the prep day wasn't so bad if you know what I mean.  You need to take someone with you- UB went with me and the doctor told him everything was fine right after the procedure. By the way, Congrats on the 3 month!!   I went for an ultrasound last night to check for endometrial(sp) cancer (sorry ladies, its a possible side effect of Tamoxifen)  and NED came for a visit. Needless to say I was very relieved. Where is our Sue??  I would have loved to talk to you the other night but I don't have your number.  Could have sworn I did................... Hope everyone is having a great night. Hugs, AE ",

(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((Suebee)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) I remember my very first post on this site was about being petrified about losing my hair.  I just couldn't stand the thought of it.  But you know what, you do what ya gotta do and take things as they come. I got my hair cut short in anticipation and then UB did the rest when it really started coming out.  Allot of ladies gather all their friends and have a hairing cutting party!!  I even know someone who, once bald, had her sister do a henna tattoo on her head.  If I remember, our Sue cut her hair when allot of the ladies were on line rooting her on.  The wigs they have nowadays are amazing - everyone I know commented on how natural mine looked.   You can even go crazy with hats and scarves.  There are plenty of websites out there to help you. You would be surprised - you might like the way you look o'natural, there sure is allot less upkeep!! Hang in there - we're here for you. AE ",

She must have seen the look of horror on my face because she asked if any other eye doctor mentioned it - I say no - she says will its just like this mole on my arm - I have had it for 40 years and nothings changed I just keep my eye on it. WTH???? Who ever heard of a mole behind your eye??? I swear this crap only happens to me. So now, every freakin time I get a headache behind that eye I'm going to think BOOTFACE!!!

Jane - congrats on finishing your semester.  Have fun packing. Sue - hope you are getting your rest - UB is having a tough time of it as well.  Work & bootface don't mix well.

So all we need is some spending money!! It will be a quick trip - we are flying into London July 16 and taking the train to Manchester - spending 2 days there with Sue and returning to London (hopefully with Sue in tow) and spending 2 days there. Then flying home on the 21st. I still can't believe we are doing it.   UB is sooooooo looking forward to taking a break in his chemo to do it.  WE CAN'T WAIT!!!!  Wish you were are going with us!!!  AE",

Since he had Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma in his intestine before the onc noticed several different small masses throughout his bowel & intestine  this time.  They attach to the lymph nodes and wind up pressing against other organs.  Thats why he was in some much pain and there is a blockage.  I think the biopsy will just confirm it and be an aid in what type of treatment he will need. Thank you for allowing him a spot on our trip to Emerald City - that made me smile!! AE",

Sheila- Jule can tell yoiu my bloodhound is a handful.  He's 110lbs and thinks he is a lap dog.  He LOVES to sit on me.  Jule - get the puppy - just keep him crated during the day until she is older - for her safety as well as your sanity.  Animals are pure joy.

Don't think of it in weeks, think of it in number of treatments, its easier that way. Just  keep following the yellow brick road................ Valerie",

But I must tell you that staying home during bc was for ME, the best thing I ever did.  It made the journey that much easier.  No germs to worry about, when I was tired I slept and I did things at my own pace.  Thats not to say when I was feeling good I didn't go a little batty .  I did get bored sometimes but like you I was in treatment during the Holidays and I kept busy shopping & decorating.  I bet your boys would love to have you home during the Christmas season.  Just something to think about!! Whatever you decide, you are still kicking that bootface right where he needs it!!! Stay strong, Valerie Shirlann - LOVE the cruise pics - I am so jealous - DH & I cruised the Caribbean a few years ago - we had a great time. I would love to do it again.",

Karen, I think Lisa is right - it is better news about your Dad.  I remember a few years back my uncle was showing signs of Alzheimer's, forgetting things, thinking he had to go to work (he was retired),etc., anyway, turned out he was deficient in B12!  He got some shots & he was good as new. Anne - I actually envy you.  I think a good cry soothes the soul.  Don't ever be ashamed to let it out. Lisa - I have to take a picture of the patio when its dark out - it looks so cool.  We have spent some time out there all ready.  I am trying to figure out this stupid router I have so I can go wireless and bring my laptop out there at night.  I remember when we were in the Keys last year, when we would walk up to Duval Street(the main drag) we passed this guy on his front porch in the dark with his laptop.  I would think to myself - now thats the life.  Just hanging out, in this beautiful town, chilling out at night.  i was so jealous!!lol. Wren - Good Luck with the surgery.  Seems like the journey never ends.   Hey Shirlann - (waving at you) - good to see ya!  How is Walt feeling??  Nancy - the cleaning never stops, does it?  Just an FYI - I always paint corners and around windows first. Sue - YOU MUST MOVE HERE!!!  The only problem would be which state??  Let us know what your preferences are and we will hook you up with the right place. lol.  How is that table coming?  I need pictures!!  UB mentioned last night about crossing the pond for a visit - maybe next year.  I REALLY want to - do your hear that UB?  (he reads here everyday) - hahahaha Sure wish you ladies would join me at Pinkstock.  It would be sooo cool to have you there. Why isn't Oprah getting back to Mel - doesn't she know how much we want this!! I know I have missed many - Ulla, Judie, Jane, Jule  -and everyone else this tired brain has forgotten - sweet dreams - AE ",

      "Content": "Jun 22, 2008 07:22AM livesstrong wrote: Hi Ladies, Valsul's daughter wrote to us in our Yahoo group and I thought I would share it with you all. She is a sweetheart - the apple didn't fall far from the tree thats for sure! Not sure what happened with mum, for me it was totally unexpected, for other members of my family they thought they knew (but that was due to them losing people years ago and if mum had gone on for another 20 years from now they'd have still known it then too).  Perhaps I was in cloud cuckoo land, but was sure that mum would be here to see my kids into their teens at least (BTW I don't have any children).  Mum swore by \"The Secret\" a book by Rhonda Byrne and it was this that got us through.  I'd predicted since mum's onc said that she could go on oral chemo that it would work and shrink the tumour - which is what happened back in April (or whenever I sent that email to you all).  Gary and I moved our wedding forward, partly because of mum's news at Christmas but mostly because we'd been together for 15.5years and when we announced our intention to wed back in early December 2007 for August this year, we thought why are we waiting, let's just do it!!  I honestly believed that we'd all be sitting together on the 29th August laughing our cotton socks off about the fact we'd moved the wedding when really there was no issue. Mum was up and down and had been hit by a multitude of things since about the 14th March.  So with that wasn't put back on to chemo as she wasn't strong enough.  Mum got gastric flu which hit her hard and as a result was admitted to hospital as she was seriously dehydrated.  After that mum didn't truly regain her strength (not enough to be dancing like she did at the wedding), but was still able to get about but required some assistance.  We'd set up a bed downstairs to save her having to walk up and down the stairs at home and several weeks ago moved her computer downstairs so she could be in touch.  Mum felt a bit under the weather on the 6th and 7th June (mostly just bunged up) but by Sunday 8th June, mum had perked up and looked great.  I'd been on her case to ensure she was drinking enough fluids, which cheesed her off no end.  And I copped for it on a number of occasions, but all in all she was doing ok. Mum didn't feel too well on Monday and by Tuesday she was looking like she did when she got admitted to hospital for dehydration, that said she'd been given some medication to help unbung her which had proven to be successful.  So with more fluids I was sure she'd be ok.  Just in case though, Dad and I raised our concerns with mum's own doctor and her District nurses who'd been out to talk with mum on the Monday.  On seeing mum on Wednesday, they believed that mum's illness had gone to the next stage - which I could not believe, apparently there were a number of things that they recognised which confimed this.  Still sure it was just dehydration, I made sure she drank lots more fluids. On Thursday mum still didn't feel to good with nurses coming out to see her throughout the day and into the evening.  Then mum past away at 1115hrs on the Friday morning. Mum's next appointment with her oncologist was due on Monday, so I'm going to go along to this to try and get a better understanding about how it all happened so fast. Still can't believe it, keep hoping that I'll wake up to discover that it was just a really terrible dream. Keep strong and big hugs to you all. Love Jen x x x x x",

I am so happy to see all the animal lovers here.  I ADORE animals.  Anyone who abuses them should be thrown in jail - PERIOD! I have reported abusers many times but nothing ever happens to them - its disgusting.  I have to tell you this story real quick.  This past weekend I went on an overnight trip with a friend to meet her mother for the first time.  She lives in the sticks of Pa. My friend is due to retire so she is always looking for a house to buy there.  The house right behind her Mom's was for sale. We went over to take a look at it. The house was in really bad shape but it had a huge garage with a screened in porch attached. We both thought it would have been a perfect place to house stray animals!! The porch could have been used to screen potentials owners!!  You see, we always wanted a place like that as well. hahaha. Animal lovers think alike!!! We are having really bad storms here, I better shut down. Hugs everyone, AE ",

Hope everyone has a great day. Now to change the subject- I have been meaning to ask Jane this for some time now and always forget as I don't post very often. I am a voracious reader and back in the 80's discovered an Australian writer named Rodney Hall, whose books I have become quite fond of. Jane, if you are familiar with Hall's books I was wondering what your opinion is of his work? The one book of his that I always recommend to people just discovering his work is a book called \"Captivity Captive\". Ladies, if you are looking for some summer reading, I strongly recommend this book. It is a fictionalized account of an actual triple murder that occurred in Australia on Christmas Day in 1898. From the opening pages of the murderer's deathbed confession through to the end, the writing is captivating as Hall details life in rural Australia. The book is narrated by one of the family members, now an elderly man. Sadly, Hall's books are hard to come by here in the states. You will probably have to order them on Amazon. Rodney Hall is certainly one of the finest writers in the world today, and more Americans need to discover his talent. That concludes my Mother's Day book review for this year. Have a great day everyone. Bill",

They have him on all kind of pain med's, when I left he was feeling pretty good!! Not sure how long the tube will be in for - I would think all day tomorrow at best.  I'm hoping they do the biopsy on Monday.  It is a holiday here so I'm not sure.  I'll ask tomorrow.  He seems to have a good attitude - he told me - \"I'm going to fight this like I did before\".

They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength. The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a \"good little hunter\" I am. Bastards! There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of \"allergies.\" I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage. Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow, but at the top of the stairs. I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches.  The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released, and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird must be an informant. I observe him communicate with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe.  For now... AE",

Lisa - HGTV is the channel I watch the most.  My fave's are Design to Sell & House Hunters.  I loved Clean Sweep - I wish they would bring it back. Sue - OMG- that pie looks FABULOUS!!! I forgot about Dirty Dancing - I've seen that movie a ton of times - every time I watch it UB makes fun of me. LOL.  He thinks its so \"gay\".  Did you all hear Patrick Swayze was just dx with pancreatic cancer??  So sad. By the way Sue UB is upset you haven't answered his email.  Everyday he asks me if you have been online. LOL.  He's such a man - he says he doesn't like to talk with anyone but when someone reaches out to him you can't shut him up!!!! Love you all, bbl, AE ",

He actually hasn't done PI kinda work in a long time.  Nancy, like you Dad he never did the cheating spouse kinda work.  He worked with a firm in NYC that worked strictly corporate cases.  Money laundering, embezzlement that kinda stuff.  His firm actually did work for some famous people - Uri Geller, Billy Joel, Yoko Ono.  But, eventually he burnt out so he left. Then he got bootface the first time and was out of work for quite awhile.  Now he does public record searches on the side and got a job in Loss Prevention for a food chain here.  Karen - LOVE the video - aren't dogs great!!!  They always make me smile!! Mel - always love your pics, keep them coming. Shirlann - can I go with you??? Please.

Considering what allot of other people are going through (cancer or not) we are hanging in there. I wish nothing but the best for all of you. Aunty Em",

The waiting is always the hardest part.  Once you have surgery and start treatment in a weird way it kinda all falls into place. Just know you are not alone and all these lovely ladies ,including myself, are here for you. Stay strong, Valerie",

OMG, Jule, those shoes are magical!!!  Its almost as if you DID have the chance to try them on they WOULD transport you to another place & time.  Love them!!! Sue - Just wanted to thank you for answering UB's emails.  You really lift his spirits. Ulla - where did you go????  So sorry about poor Eric.  I wanted to tell you that when UB & I were at the oncky's the gentleman across for us was asking about an article he read about sugar & cancer!!!  The problem was I couldn't hear his oncky's response.  Small world, huh? Speaking of small worlds - I woman walked into the room today to start her treatment and I told UB that she looked familiar.  It took me awhile but I remembered I met here last year when I was going thru rad's!!!  The machine had broken down that day and they asked us all to wait until it was fixed.  We were there so late they ordered dinner for us! This woman was there that day and we sat and talked for hours.  Unfortunately, she had a reoccurence - but she was very optimistic.  What are the odds of me seeing her today???  Unbeileveable. Lisa - hope you are doing better today.  Some kinda crud is going around - allot of ladies on the boards are complaining.  Feel better sweety. Hey Sue - did my first mystery shop tonight - it was fun!!!  UB went with me and was a big help, he should have been,  after all he is a Private Investigator!!!

I had to call my oncologist and cancel my NastyLasta shot because I'm feeling so lousy. We had a bit of a row yesterday( a little British slang for Sue) over the shot and he insisted that I get it. My dr. by the way is British and doesn't have anywhere the sense of humor that Sue has...conservative, stern and stoic, no sense of humor...his last name is Richards and I think he got po'd once when I said he should have named his son Keith. Anyway, enough about me. I hope everyone is doing well and I want to thank everyone for your kind remarks and prayers for Valerie and me. Valerie has got me hooked on this sight, so if you don't mind a lymphoma patient infiltrating your sight now and then, you will be hearing more from me. Feel better everyone and have a great weekend.

You might have to sleep on the floor - but what the heck!!! lol.  Are you still planning on coming in Sept?? Lisa - 2 -5 yrs.old are the best years - thats when they are at their cutest.  I still tease my 11yr.old nephew about the things he did and said at that age - I remember when he was 3 he was outside on the patio with his dad and all of a sudden he pee'd all over the cement!!  His father told him sternly not to do it ever again and his response was - \"What do you expect, I'm an only child\"!!!!  He was 3!!!! hahahaha.  Well it was an absolutely beautiful day here today - we went to Home Depot and got new indoor/outdoor carpet for the patio.  I'm going to work out there all day tomorrow- after I hit a few yard sales, of course. Ub is calling - gotta walk the dogs. bbl, AE ",

I have to tell you ladies- I just can't keep up with you all!! lol. UB & I are doing good.  He stills get tired and is going in November for another CAT scan to make sure everything is OK. Then his port will come out.  We are still planning the move next spring/summer.  I am slowly cleaning out the clutter and fixing things around here. With the grace of God everything will work out. Mel - was it you who asked about my weight?   First of all, the Pinkstock pictures of me are horrible. I hadn't showered in 2 days!  I have put at least 25lbs on since chemo. I think the only thing that helps is that I am tall - 5'9\" - so it doesn't show as much - but you should see my fat belly.  I ALWAYS had the flatest stomach - not anymore.  Sigh. Well I'm off to watch Seinfeld with UB. Love ya's, AE",

She was dx summer of '06 and we went thru chemo together in October of that year.  She was currently on Herciptan ?sp & Arimedex when they discovered the bootface in her liver.  She had some scans recently and all her vitals are in great shape.  So all she needs to do is concentrate on zapping bootface to oblivion.  We are still planning on hooking up with a few more October Warriors as we like to call ourselves in NYC in May/June of this year. She is, as we say hear in Jersey, one tough broad!! Hopefully she will post soon. Thanks ladies, as always, you are the best!!! Love ya, Aunty Em     ",

Sue, so you had a meltdown at the hospital - don't stress over it, I am sure they have seen worse. You keep eating missy -  you'll have plenty of time later to lose any weight you have gained. Ulla - trust me when I tell you the worst is over.   You will have a nice break and by the time rads start you will all ready being feeling allot like your old self.  Where is Karyll??  Should I send the monkeys out to look for her???

As far as hair goes, I started losing mine later then most girls.  It was after my 3rd treatment.  I went to my hair dresser and she cut my hair short. By the time I went for a wig fitting I was losing it and the lady at the Wellness Center cut off more.  It would bother me when I laid down so DH shaved off the rest!! I did the same for him when he was sick!!!  Kinda weird. Anyway its been almost a year since my last treatment and I just decided to let my hair grow long again.  It grew back very curly (I had straight hair) and salt & pepper in color (I was a brunette).  The picture that I posted from the Keys a month ago was me after 2 haircuts. I hope all of you ladies realize how special & strong you really are. Keep up the fight!!! Love ya, Valerie",

Here is latest on UB - he isn't going to wait the 3 weeks to go back to the onky.  He is going next week with me (I have my 6 month follow up).  He hasn't been feeling good - very fatigued, he still gets short of breath and his kidney still bothers him.  So bottom line is he'll probably do the chemo. We'll know more next week.  Bootface - the gift that keeps on giving. Haven't read back much (you ladies are very chatty- lol). Cathi - soooo sorry to hear about your daughter.  I will add her to my prayers.  Please keep us posted. Margo is adorable - the best of luck with her. Karen - try not to stress over what your DH said.  Bottom line is -  if you haven't gone through what we have gone through you just don't understand.  Period.

But since then every time I go for a mammo they find \"something\" and  I need to have biopsies done.  I can tell you that it gets old quick.  When I mentioned to my surgeon I was thinking of getting a mastectomy she said it was definitely not the way to go. Sometimes I wonder if the reason why she said it is because she is making money off of all the biopsies. Who knows. Trust your instincts they are usually right. Good Luck!",

Dear Friends, We have been so overwhelmed by the outpouring of prayer, hope, smiles and of course the Roses for and about Deb.   I told Traci, I couldn't post anything to tell you of Deb's passing.   I just didn't want to discourage anyone for even a second.   But you all have turned Debs passing into a triumph.  You People are truly incredible, beautiful people.  GOD BLESS YOU ALL! I told our pastor, if we were going to have a funeral I wasn't going.  Instead, with your help it was truly a celebration.    The church was packed.  Almost 500 people attended with may more sending their regrets.  (haven't heard from Sarah yet (LOL) but Todd Palin is off to the Iron Dog with our friend Scott Davis & I heard she was in Wash D.C. so I doubt if she is available.) 500 in a community of 15,000 is incredible.  The flowers were great.  Pastor Randy was great.  (He probably will get converts! J) Deb's friends read poetry, articles they had written about her and told stories.  We cried a little and laughed a lot.    Denise, a friend from the hospital and church, wore a balloon hat and brandished a balloon sword.  (Deb was known to some groups as the balloon lady.)  The service was supposed to be about 45 min with an hour reception following.  The service lasted an hour and 40 minutes and I don't know how long the reception lasted but it went on a long time.   (I didn't get to sit, drink, eat......)  Just lots of hugs, laughs, upbeat music, and of course a few tears.   (The girls played \"I'm beautiful Damn it\" by Bette Midler. If you haven't heard it go listen to it. It's a hoot as Deb would say!)  The girls passed the flowers out to all the ladies who stayed for the reception.  We were all exhausted but the girls wanted to go learn swing dancing that evening.   Again, if you know Deb, that would be very appropriate.   So off they went, while I caught up with the family in town.  I have been totally excited to see the posts, topics, pictures, stories, and Ideas.   I also love the thread about contacting President Obama.   In church Sunday, I spoke to a couple who has a very close friend who they say is terminal.  I pointed them to the websites.  But as I talked to them and hear of others having to go through what you all do, I get Angry.  Not for our loss but D___ It!  No one should have to have this disease and go through what you all have/are going through.  Ok I'm done venting. I saw the Picture of Deb with 3 drinks in her hand at Pink stock.  We all laughed and smiled at that one.  That's Deb! I love the \"Do something crazy\" Idea.  Deb is probably joining in. Also, from the Girls & I, thank you for helping Deb through her struggle.   She valued your help, support and friendships so much. Your efforts made life easier for us all.  Thank you.     Bless you all.  Talk to you later. John",

Did you read this -  If you develop a new and relatively sudden case of lymphedema, seek immediate medical attention. Infection, also called cellulitis, is your enemy, a prime trigger of edema. Cellulitis is readily and effectively treated by many available and reasonably priced antibiotics, including penicillin, Keflex, and Cipro. A short-term course of antibiotics usually has minimal side effects. Start antibiotics under the direction of your physician. Call your doctor's office during the day, or page your doctor at night or on the weekend if necessary, to get the prescription. (Have handy the phone number of a pharmacy you know will be open.) Be sure to let your doctor know if you have any allergies to antibiotics. Without prompt treatment, an infection can spread up your arm and cause significant swelling. Eventually, if an infection isn't treated, it can get into the bloodstream and involve the rest of your body. It can even become life threatening. Cover burns with Silvadene cream and a clean dressing; periodically cleanse, and reapply the cream and bandage. Keep any cuts or abrasions clean: Wash the area two to three times a day with a solution that's half peroxide and half water, and apply antibiotic ointment and a bandage.",

She didn\u2019t even require Tylenol. Her bed was set in the living room in the middle of all the action. On Saturday, the night before she died, she was sitting up in bed laughing watching her girls play with their wii. Sunday morning came and the cold Alaska landscape was shimmering with sunlight. It was a beautiful day. The girls went to church early and John left a little later. When he returned he kissed Deb\u2019s forehead and said \u201cHi, I\u2019m back.\u201d Her parents and cousin were there with her as well as her best friend. After a while her friend called him over to her bedside and the time was growing near. He held her hand and talked to her and kissed her. Deb was in no pain, bathed in sunlight, with her family around her when she took her last breath. And at the very moment she passed her dogs went absolutely nuts. They were barking like mad and began deliberately running to the South-South West field all the while they were looking up at the sky, clearly following something. John and the family watched them because they knew they were watching Deb break free of the chains of cancer and she was free to be outside and flying high to her loving God who awaited her. When John looked back at the bed, he saw that the body there was not Deb, what was there was just the body that housed her. Deb\u2019s spirit could not be contained, she soared free. And she is with her family and with all of us. And she is Deb again. Cancer can never touch her ever again. Deb is free.  ",

      "Content": "Apr 23, 2008 09:44PM - edited Apr 23, 2008 09:46PM by livesstrong Where I was - on 9/11 I was on a bus heading to South Jersey.  I work for a company that supplies a major supermarket chain in the Northeast and in some of our stores one of the unions went on strike.  So all of the corporate people had to be \"scabs\" and work in the stores.  One of my co-workers got a call on the bus from her daughter saying a plane had crashed in the WTC.  Shortly after we got to the store the other plane hit.  They decided to close the store and we had to wait for the bus to come back and bring us home. No one spoke the entire trip back.  I remember how empty the highway was that day.   Nancy, do you remember what a beautiful day it was?  Not a cloud in the sky! I couldn't help but notice that there where no planes flying.  It was surreal. It was the longest 2 hours, I just wanted to get home. When we were approaching our office I remember all the office buildings, including ours, having these HUGE American flags flying and everyone on the bus applauding when we saw them. I found out a few days later one of the employees in my area lost his wife - she was 7 months pregnant.  I still haven't been to the site, maybe some day. I think living so close makes it that much harder.  If I remember, Princess Di passed on a Saturday, right?  I remember watching it for hours on TV.  Just horrific. She was so beautiful and loved by so many.  I felt the same way about JFK,jr. Jeez, am I ever sorry I brought this up!! Good Luck tomorrow Sue.   Karen - We are going to see Lou Reed tomorrow - ever hear of him? AE ",

He was lumbering thru one morning and some of the stupid campers were running after him to get a picture!! Another time UB & I rented a log home in the Adirondack Mountains in NY. They were having an  usually hot  spell there and the house wasn't air conditioned.  The first night we decided to sleep on the floor in the living room  keeping the sliding glsss door open because it was cooler.  The next morning the owner of the house told use to be on guard because there was a bear in the area.  Sure enough, when we were driving out to go to town a bear crossed the road right in front of us.  All I could think of is what if that bear came in the house in the middle of the night?!!!  Anyway, great story!!

Your grandkids should not be subjected to that either.  God, I swear it never ends. Well it's official - the trip is canceled. UB went to the onky again today who immediately sent him to a lung specialist. He told Bill he thinks he might have pcp pneumonia. It is very common in AIDS & cancer patients and is very serious. He put him on 2 antibiotics and in a week he wants him to have a chest xray. If it still hasn't improved he will need to go into the hospital for a procedure where they will have to take samples of lung tissue to see for sure what it is and how to treat it. He told him flat out he doesn't want him to travel anywhere, especially overseas. So seeing our Sue has been put on hold - I am so uspset about everything I could just scream!!! Please pray the antbiotics work So that's it in a nut shell, as always,  the fun continues........... AE",

I'm here to tell you that Pinkstock '08 was amazing!!  Did you all check out the pictures on the Get Together thread? I went with my gf Terry, UB stayed home with the pooches.  We stayed with one of the ladies  Thursday night then drove to MB's on Friday.  MaryBeth is AMAZING!!!  She opened her home to all of us crazy women and some family members and treated us like queens. I met women from North Carolina, Florida, Loiuisana, Michigan, NY, NJ and California.  Kristen brought her band and put on a show Saturday night. We sat by the fire and talked and stared at all the stars in the sky. The food was great and the drinks were flowing. There were allot of donations from different organizations (Terry works for Liz Clairbourne and bought boxes of stuff they donated).  We all walked away with quite a few goodies.  AlaskaDeb couldn't make it but sent a box full of gifts from her home state. We slept in a trailer but didn't shower for 2 days!!! Just like Woodstock!!  The weather was perfect except for a storm overnight Friday.  Some things got a tad wet by dried soon enough.  We just hung out and talked, ate , drank, laughed and cried.   It was great!!!  We left Sunday and it took us 8 hours to get home but I didn't care.  I was so happy I went.  MB's Dh said it was OK to have it there next year, I hope I can make it.   I STRONGLY recommend going -it was worth the trip. bbl dogs need to be fed.

Learn the warning signs and the precautions to take. Make these guidelines and a heightened awareness a regular part of your life. Skin care is your first line of defense. Since the skin acts as a barrier to infection, any disruption of the skin can spell trouble. Burns, chafing, dryness, cuticle injury (such as hangnails), cracks, cuts, splinters, and insect bites are immediate risks for infection. Learn to recognize the signs of infection: Infection and inflammation can escalate quickly. Redness, tenderness, and warmth can spread from the injury up your arm. Call your doctor as soon as you suspect infection. You may need to start antibiotics immediately with any early sign of trouble. If you already have swelling, or if you have diabetes (whether or not you have swelling) you may need antibiotics after just the smallest of injuries\u2014even without any sign of trouble. If you already have significant arm edema, sometimes a dental procedure may trigger an arm infection. This is because the work a dentist does on the tissues in your mouth may increase the number of bacteria circulating in your bloodstream. Vulnerable areas in the body, like the compromised drainage of a swollen arm, may become hangouts for the bacteria. If you've already had an arm infection following dental work, talk to your doctor about whether you should take prophylactic (preventive) antibiotics before future dental procedures. (People with heart valve disease take prophylactic antibiotics before or right after a dental procedure for the same reason.) Do's and Don'ts: Preventing Lymphedema",

Mel,OMG - I swear reading about your SO was like reliving the past few days with my brother.  I will try to make it brief -  Last Friday he collapses, I got a call from a friend and UB & I go to the hopsital - he is on a ventilator. He went into cardiac arrest and had to be paddled twice to bring him back. The resident tells me he was out for 10 minites and they were concerned about brain damage.  By Sunday he is sitting in a chair and talking!!! - had some short term memory problems but they thought it would pass. I call Monday morning to see how he is and they proceed to tell me he was suffering form the DT's and had a horrific night - hallucinating, anxious, argumentative. I couldn't believe it - I am thinking he has been sober for over 20 years.  They did give him something to control the withdrawal and by late Monday he was a bit calmer.   Tuesday they put a stent in and the doctor tells us he wants to put a defibrillator in also, but will wait a few days.  He also has a leaky valve that needs to be replaced but doesn't want to do that just yet.  They proceed to tell me that he is still withdrawing and it pretty out of it - that it takes 3-5 days to get out of his system. Meanwhile I spoke to his friends who told me over & over again that he wasn't drinking (they are all former alcoholics that work with him and know all the signs).  I finally spoke with him today and he is still out of it, but not as bad.  He SWEARS to me he hasn't been drinking.  I'm beginning to wonder if the lack of oxygen he experienced contributed to his behavior. It is all one big mess. He is not married and has no kids - I'm all he has.  UB & I are going tomorrow to see him and try to get some concrete answers - I would really like a brain scan done to rule out things. Anyway, that is the story and how my vacation ended - all that and UB starts back on chemo next week! You gotta love it................................ AE",

What do you know about my mum?     Well, mum had a penchant for Percy Pigs.  In case you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, Percy Pigs are jelly sweets that can only be bought from Marks & Spencers.  Mum believed that Percy Pigs were a cure-all for any ailment.  When in hospital most patients would be brought grapes, I think Percy Pigs are partly grape flavoured, but because mum had such a huge sweet tooth, we\u2019d all bring her a packet of Percy Pigs which mum would regularly share with her fellow patients to see them through their hospital visit.     Mum had cheesy feet.  There was no getting away from it.  After a hard day at work, or long day at the shops, mum\u2019s feet would hum.  I always knew the instant mum took off her shoes.  If she wiggled her toes \u2013 well you had no chance \u2013 the smell would reach your nostrils before you had chance to say \u201cdon\u2019t take your shoes off!\u201d.  The cats loved mum\u2019s feet, for them, the cheesier the better.     Mum always had a book on the go.  One of her Christmas presents from the family was Rupert Everett\u2019s \u201cRed Carpets and Other Banana Skins\u201d.  Of an evening she would read excerpts to me that would have us rolling on the floor with laughter.   If mum didn\u2019t have her nose in a book, she would be upstairs on the computer surfing the internet.  Mum visited a breast cancer forum where she made some fantastic friends in Canada and the US who have testified just these last few days that mum was a great support and inspiration to them and that she\u2019ll be hugely missed.  In order to help mum through her tough time with Chemo, the girls made a hug in the form of a patchwork quilt for mum with pictures of themselves and messages.  They\u2019ve assured me that their thoughts will be with mum and us today.     Mum is one of very few people I know who love their job.  I don\u2019t think it was her job so much, but more the family of people she would get together with daily.  She loved everyone she worked with at the Liver buildings and always looked forward to getting back to work.     Mum loved writing and the writing group she skipped along to on a Tuesday evening.  Mum was fond of everyone in the group and loved the feedback on her work, some of which has been published, although she never got to finish her book.       Mum was no help at all when it came to choosing my wedding dress.  To mum, everything I tried on was \u201cOh Jen, that looks beautiful.\u201d  This annoyed me no end, so much so I dragged Louise out with us one day, who provided the same answer but in stereo.   Mum was truly delighted with her \u201cfrock\u201d - as she described it in her scouse accent - for the wedding.  She looked stunning in it too.   The best was seeing her strut her stuff on the dance floor to Guns\u2019n\u2019Roses \u201cSweet Child O\u2019 Mine\u201d.  To my friends\u2019 astonishment, mum knew all the words to the rock song.  Well, she was a secret rock chick being into bands like ZZ top, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and the Stones to name but a few.       Mum never gave up, and even on the Tuesday before she passed away she was talking about the Cholmondeley Castle Fireworks Concert and hoping that their Pimms tent would be open this year.     I\u2019m sure I speak for us all in that we\u2019ve lost someone truly special.  For Nat and I we have lost our mum and dad has lost his wife but I think I\u2019m right in saying that Dad, Nat and I have lost our greatest friend.     For me, my mum was my best friend.       Here are some words for Mum\u2026.     A ship sails and I stand watching till she fades on the horizon and someone at my side says She is gone.     Gone where? Gone from my sight, that is all. She is just as large now as when I last saw her. Her diminished size and total loss from my sight is in me, not in her.         Gun's & Rose's ???????????????????????????????? I hope you are dancing your ass off in heaven my friend !!!   AE       ",

All things considered, that could be a good thing right now. I haven't hallucinated since the ' '70s. Anyway, Valerie doesn't like it when I tell stories of my jaded past. Suffice to say the last treatment left me feeling like I had been hit by a truck. After 9 years, I'm not sure how much more fight I have left. The only thing that keeps me going is Valerie's love and support. Thank you all for your support and well wishes. I sincerely hope that the day will come when we can all meet. I hope everyone has a great summer, or in Jane's case, a great winter. Continue to feel good ladies and continue to support each other the way you all do. Your support in the past has done wonders for Valerie when she has needed it. I enjoy looking at your photos and placing the faces with the names. Does that make any sense? Anyway, you are all beautiful...I especially like your photo Karen, the way your hair is covering your one eye. It has a provocative quality about it.

So, from that point on I felt like I was on a amusement ride. DH & I both walked away with a few scratches.  I remember the ambulance driver after seeing the truck say to the cop - \"are there any survivors\".  I truly believe we had a guardian angel watching over us that night. By the way, congrats on calling the cops on your deadbeat ex.  I hope it works. Where is our Ulla?  Its been days now.  I'm starting to worry.  Ulla, even if you feel crappy just post an \"I am here\". Sue, I hope you are sleeping the day away.  Aunty Em says you need your rest!!  Gotta run, a bff is coming over today.

So he goes back for that tomorrow.  Thank Heaven the oncky's office is 10 minutes away!!  Sue, you'll get a kick out of this - it was \"English Tea Day\" in the chemo room.  A local caterer brought in pastries, finger sandwichs, cookies, scones and plenty of English Breakfest!!!  How nice was that!!  There was so much there they told us to take some home.  The scones (sp) were d- lish, so I scaffed 3 of them.  We get home I put my purse on the kitchen counter, next thing I know big old Delbert steals one of the scones and starts running around the house with it!!!!  hahahaha.  Goofball.  UB is calling him scone head now.  hahahahaha Lisa - so glad to see you post, but sorry to hear your not feeling well.  We have so kinda funky virus going around here in Jersey so I think wren is right.  Rest up and I'm sure you will be feeling good as new soon. Jule - OMG!!!! You found Dorothy's shoes!!!!!   You know what that meas ladies- road trip to  DC then off to the Carolina's to check out Oz.  HOW COOL IS THAT!!!!! I know I missed speaking to most of you but want to spend some time with UB. bbl, Valerie ",

Lucy - how lucky for you to find someone that you can connect with  so deeply.  Enjoy every minute. Lisa- Congrats on DD's spot.   I hope you don't have to travel far tomorrow. I'm sure your bone scan will be fine - I have THE WORST aches and pains from Tamoxifen. I feel like I am 100yrs. old.  I asked my oncky this week to give me something else - so he prescribed Arimedex (sp) - from what I hear its suppose to be worse !!! Karen - I am due to go to my ob/gyn this month.  He told me last year that he is going to want to do a transvaginal ultrasound this year as I will be on the Tamoxifen for a year and there is a risk of endometrial (sp) cancer.  Oh Joy,  ANOTHER procedure!!! Shirlann- how are you feeling??  Hope the fall does interfere with your trip.  UB is beginning to feel the effects of the chemo.  He has been having pains in his stomach and back near his kidney.  He's telling me the percocet isn't working.  Might have to call the oncky to get something stronger.  Other then that he is hanging in there.  He wanted me to tell you all that he appreciates your concern and to tell Sue he will definitely join you on the road to Oz but he's not sure that beer & chocolate are such a good combo.  I snuck out this afternoon and got my hair cut. I was suppose to get a cut & color last week but with UB being in the hospital I cancelled.  Money is a little tight right now so I put the color on hold. But I have to say for the first time in a LONG time I finally have a hair style!! LOL.  Before when I went she would just shape it a little, now I had enough hair for her to actually do something with it.  My curls are starting to disappear as well - HOORAY!!! Now, I can't wait to get rid of the grey. Well they called and scheduled the biospy - its March 20th.  They say I should be there no more then 2 hours so thats a good thing I guess. I wish it were tomorrow. UGH!! We are suppose to get some snow tonight, thank God its the weekend.  I am just lying low tomorrow - building a fire, snuggling under the afghan that the ladies on the afghan thread sent me this week - Yeah, Sue, I got one too, its beautiful, with Delberts big head in my lap - speaking of the knucklehead he just walked in the room - came over - let me kiss him on the nose and walked out -  what a goofball. I might be back later. Love to all, AE ",

She had her biopsy yesterday and I had an opportunity to speak with the dr. while Val was still in the enchanted forest and the dr. said she was confident that the biopsy would be negative. Finally some good news. I am mentally preparing myself for my third chemo treatment tomorrow. Not an easy thing, as all of you know. Sue, Valerie and I are looking forward to your visit in Sept. Hope you are feeling better. Val said you haven't been feeling well lately. Hope everyone is doing well. Anyway, I just wanted to jump on and say, Hi!. Talk to everyone soon. UB aka Bill ",

About houses - UB & I have lived in a 1200sq.ft townhome for 18 years.  I like it but I am so ready to move.  I have no basement or garage, just an attic and a small storage closet.   It makes it very difficult to store anything big.  I guess you can say we have outgrown the place.   True I don't have to worry about snow removal and yard maintainence but I PAY dearly for it.  I still plant my own flowers and shovel my walk (because of the dogs).  They only perk is the pool.  Having neighbors right next to you is no picnic either.  I have no backyard for the dogs, so I have to take them out on a leash everytime we go out!  And the best part is - my taxes are 4500.00 a year!!!! Sorrry, I got carried away!!! LOL.  Just something to think about Lisa!   I want nice, small, 3 bedroom, 2 bath ranch with a garage and or basement. Sorry for the rant!!  (:<) AE",

I went thru a period after treatment where I said \"the he%$ with it\" and ate too much of everything I like. Well, needless to say I went up a dress size!!!    With winter setting in here, I really have to be more careful. DH ws looking at way too many skinny ladies in Florida last week!!!  I think now you should eat whatever you want to keep your strength up.  After this is over you can concentrate on being careful.

Hopefully you are getting some much needed rest. After reading your posts I couldn't help but notice how far you have come.  Think back when your journey started and how sad, confused and angry you were.  What a difference a month makes.  Things really do get easier.  You are such a STRONG woman!!!  Try not to fret so much over the whole \"wig\" thing.  I remember I was so paranoid about losing my hair.  It was actually the topic of my first post on the boards. I found a really great place that specialized in the big \"C\", so they were very understanding.  I took a BFF with me and she helped me pick one out then afterwards we went to lunch!! LOL. Long story short, the wig was actually a perfect match to my hair and everyone had a hard time believing it was a wig!! I have some pics of me wearing it. If I can find them I will post one for you to see. Have a great night everyone. Valerie",

As far as work goes, why not try a wait & see.  I didn't work only because in NJ we have state diasbility and it really doesn't give you the option of choosing what days you can/can't work.  It's all or nothing.  There were days when I felt good enough to work so I would go to lunch with friends and do some shopping, etc. They weren't ALL bad days.  I'm thinking maybe your nurse suggested not working because of where you work.  You'll have too much contact with people and when your immune system is low the least amount of contact the better.  Bottom line, wait and see.
