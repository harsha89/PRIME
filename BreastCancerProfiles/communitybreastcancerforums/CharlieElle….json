My last surgery on 9/6/17 left me with an open wound three inches deep two inches wide...VERY PAINFUL. I healed fast with a wound vac but the pain was a nightmare and has left me traumatized! I am scheduled to see a specialist next month to have ultrasound done and more than likely another surgery to remove breast tissue that has sebaceous cyst fragments due to one of the two cysts rupturing every time. This healing from inside to out with dry packing (dressing) is my enemy.....and the wound vac dressing changes have left me in shock.... I CAN DEFINE PAIN",
