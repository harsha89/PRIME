Sort of like at home debridement. So now I have an opening with glistening pink/white tissue but no more dead tissue.  I'm not sure how the sides are going to come together but he told me to expect it to heal just fine.  I also worry about something happening to the expander because of this.  Another worry is that the skin will be thin once the opening heals and cause expander problems.  Plus, I haven't had a fill since surgery and like Digger, I'm desperate for fills so I can get this over with. I did read on the web that the basics of wound care were to debride dead tissue so healthy tissue could thrive and keep the wound moist/covered.  Also eat lots of protein and nutrient dense fruits and veggies and lots Vit. C.  I'm glad we wound challenged, delayed fill girls found each other. I think we all have similar concerns.   Francine, I'm so sorry you're losing your expander.  I do think the vac will help close your wound more quickly. Best wishes on your surgery. Sherry ",
