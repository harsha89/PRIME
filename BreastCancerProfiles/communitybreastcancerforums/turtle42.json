What I am concerned about is it looks like my implant came loose from the middle of my chest and is migrating towards the outer side. There is definitely a large empty space in the center of my chest. If this happened would I feel it let loose? I don't remember anything happinging but I do run on a treadmill and I'm pretty active. I don't see my plastic surgeon until September and I'm quite concerned about this. Thanks for any advice.

The doctor couldn't feel the lump, I had to put his finger on it. Did an ultrasound biopsy and he was saying that we would have a good laugh about it later when it came back benign as he was so sure it would. Needless to say we never had that laugh.",

I saw my surgeon today and she still wants limited use of arms. After my fill today I don't really want to use them due to pain so I guess that's a good thing.  Hope you are doing well, Jackie",

This is why I am choosing to due a double mastectomy.  I'm just looking for any advise. I will have a latissimus on the radiated side with reconstruction on both sides. Is there still a chance of complications with the radiated side this long after treatment? I'm having a really hard time with this.
