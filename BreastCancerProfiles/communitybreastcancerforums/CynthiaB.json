Try to remain positive until your tests are complete and until you get more information from the mammogram. It's good that you're getting the tests you need. I have had bunches of mammograms, MRI's and Ultrasounds and even though in the end I was diagnosed (after many years) with breast cancer...I'm still here, I'm in pretty good shape and hopeful for my future. Everyone here will support you. Take care of yourself and try be nice to you.",
