He said last breast doc definitely dropped the ball because although they didn't find cancer cells they see many red blood cells, he said it may be the start or something. He seemed concerned and wants me in on Monday after a new ultrasound on both breast are done this Thursday. Now I am worried.",

I am 45 years old and have had \"fibrocystic \" breast for over 8 years. I also have extremely dense tissue so an ultrasound is also done. I am told to have enumerable cysts in both breast. I have had many issues but always told it just cystic. A year ago one grew to the size of a lemon, it was drained and was found to be fine. Last summer I noticed blood on my left bra cup then it happened after a shower. Went to my breast \"specialist\" and she did test to see if it was blood and it was, although she never sent it out to be tested. There was no blood the day a galactogram was ordered so I was then scheduled for a breast MRI this past August. The breast doctor called and told me everything was fine and that I should schedule an appointment in 6 months!!! I am going to see another doctor next week, I still have bloody discharge, sometimes brown sometimes red. I have many cysts and lumps from my breast to under my arms, and yesterday I noticed a larger one that must have grown just recently. I believed the doctor that I didn't have cancer and just chalked it up to fibrocystic changes, but my mother, sister and friends won't let it be so I am going to see another breast specialist. Has anyone ever had fibrocystic breast? Is this what happens? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

I hope you are doing well, have you been diagnosed?  I am only scared because its been about 7 months or so having a bloody discharge from just one duct and it has not gone away. If it is \"nothing to be worried about\" shouldn't it have stopped? What made me really fine a different breast surgeon (along with my moms urging) is that it has now gone to just one duct in the other breast.",
