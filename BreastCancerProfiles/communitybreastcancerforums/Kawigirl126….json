My BS said that swelling could take months to subside. Also, she explained that there is non-breast tissue under the arm that the weight of the breast pulls down/forward. When the breast is removed, that tissue is \"released\" and now rests up under the arm. The amount varies among women, by the original size and weight of the breast, and by how much tissue was removed. If you have what is known as \"dog ears\", which is a larger amount of tissue that's really in the way and is kind of droopy (thus the name), that can be surgically corrected. Something to talk about with your surgeon. But, it does take time for the tissues to reabsorb the fluids caused by the surgery. Glad you're having no pain - although that swelling can be a pain, right?",

This came after a December '15 diagnosis of IDC, grade 1, stage 1, ER/PR+/HER2-. I had a lumpectomy on Jan. 7. They also took and tested 4 lymph nodes. The nodes were clear, but the surgical margins were not. DCIS. I had a re-excision (went back in to try to get clean margins) on Jan. 14. No luck, still finding DCIS cells. So, I met with a medical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, and a plastic surgeon. I was offered the options of radiation with follow-up Arimidex for 5 years; radiation, no Arimidex; mastectomy with recon, Arimidex; mastectomy w/o recon, Arimidex; Arimidex alone; do nothing. I chose the mx and Arimidex. I did have support at home - a hubby who was off for the summer (we're both educators) and could help out. I also have a wonderful network of friends who stepped in when needed. My surgery was outpatient. In fact, I felt better after the mx than I did after the first lumpectomy with the node biopsy. I went in at 8:30 am for a 10:00 surgery and was home by 3 that afternoon ready to eat lunch. The next night I went to dinner and a car show with my family. I went the next day for a follow-up with my surgeon. At that visit she took off the big bandages and wrap, declared me \"looking excellent,\" rebandaged me, and sent me home with a bag full of supplies and a somewhat uncomfortable post-surgical bra. The hospital had arranged home health care who came out the second day after my surgery. She examined me, talked with my husband and me, and determined that I did not need her to come back. She did leave me her number in case I later decided that we needed some help. Though I didn't call her back, it was very comforting knowing that I had that resource. As I healed, I got a post-surgical camisole and \"fluff\" breast forms. I still wear them from time to time as they're very comfortable. I got my silicone form and \"real bra\" 3 months after the surgery. The most difficult aspect of all this for me was dealing with the drain - just uncomfortable and annoying - and having to wear that surgical bra. My BS is very conservative and takes no shortcuts. Ten days with the drain and 3 weeks in the bra. I've since healed very well. It took me about 6 weeks to get my energy back. Had the luxury of being able to take naps when I needed. I took Rx pain meds about 5 days - mostly at night to help me sleep. I have a \"lovely\" scar that I call my permanent Pink Ribbon. It's faded quite a bit over this year. I wear mx bras and a breast form - all of which my insurance covers. No one can tell that I have a \"foob\" (fake boob) unless I choose to go without it - which I do at the gym. I was an A cup to start with, so it's not super obvious. Besides, it's cooler and more comfortable that way. I have had only a couple of side effects with the Arimidex - occasional muscle spasms and some cognitive issues - what some call \"Chemo Brain\", what I call \"CRS (Can't Remember Sh**) syndrome. I chose this route because I wanted a \"one and done\" approach. I usually choose the least complicated approach if at all possible. I'm very happy and have never doubted that what I did was right for me and my family. Your choice is a very personal one. Talk to lots of women who have been through this. I did and it was most helpful. Some doctors will have lists of women who have volunteered to meet with new patients. The American Cancer Society can also give you a list of volunteers in your area. Read information with a careful approach. Ask your health care providers for trusted websites. Personally, I chose this site, Mayo Clinic, and the American Cancer Society sites. If you have any questions, feel free to PM me. I'm happy to help in any way. And know that you are not alone in this. You have lots of ladies on this site who are with you in spirit and eager to answer any questions you have. I found their support invaluable. Peace and keep breathing....................",

I have a breast surgeon, medical oncologist who provides counseling contacts, and a radiation oncologist. They meet weekly as a team to discuss all of their cases. And they keep my PCP up to date too. They were recommended to me by my radiologist. The more you know, the easier it will be. Both in regards to what exactly your dealing with and what the treatment plan will be. Being in limbo is the hardest part, whether you're waiting on test results, or waiting to create that plan, or waiting to meet with your docs. You have a great support system here. Lots of knowledge and experience, not to mention empathy and caring. We're all in this together and willing to help out where we can. Keep visiting here.

Good for you for finding someone who takes you seriously and for getting on things right away. Your health is too important. I'm also glad that your doc wants to talk with you in person. I got my diagnosis over the phone. First call was while I was driving home from work. She asked did I have a few minutes to talk. I told her I wanted to call her when I got home and could give her my attention. Got home and she called back with the cancer diagnosis. Not the best way for me, but at least she got right back to me the day after my biopsy and got me in to see the surgeon the very next day. I hope that you get \"not devastating\" news. I've had cysts that came up quite quickly and turned out to be nothing. Just needed to have them aspirated. Also have had several fibroids that came and went. The curses of dense breast tissue. :-/ Peace to you!",

It will help them as much as it helps you. And, remember, you're not alone in this. You are part of a team. Take everything one step at a time. I know that the unknown can cause your thoughts to run wild and create all kinds of \"what if\" scenarios. When that happens, remember to breathe. It has helped me to write down my questions so I won't have to remember them when I talk with my medical team. In fact, my surgeon has started to ask me, \"so, what questions do you have today?\" Do what the surgical team tells you so that you'll heal well. And, if you're not sure about something, ask questions. And do remember the options for second opinions. One thing that has helped for me to keep in mind is that thousands of women go through this very situation every year. So, you're in good company. Talk with other women. Visit this website and it's discussion boards. Some wonderful, caring, knowledgeable women hang out here. Peace to you and good luck with your surgery. Keep breathing......................",

My first 2 breast surgeries (I ultimately ended up having 3 in all) were afternoon. I was so nervous with the first one, I wasn't hungry. The second was a re-excision and I busied myself that day by going to work. Being thirsty was more annoying than being hungry. But the IV seemed to help with the thirst. In fact, my biggest problem was having to get up to pee all the time. Really annoying when you're in a hospital gown and connected to an IV bag! If you run into that issue, you can ask them to turn the speed of the drip down. The anti-anxiety drugs are great. If they offer one, take it! Keep breathing...................",

From what I've read here, it seems it's either based on your insurance or your medical team. Lots of differing experiences.

I had my first surgery in January of 2016 and just wanted to say that you can come through this and out the other side doing well. I had a lumpectomy/SNB, then re-excision because of dirty margins with the first surgery, then a right-side mastectomy because the re-excision still had cancerous margins. Because my lymph nodes were clear, and I chose the mx, I was able to forgo rads and chemo. I chose the single mx because my MO and BS said they didn't recommend a bilateral due to no family history. My MO explained that the two breasts are different \"systems\". Said my best options for non-recurrence were mx and AI for 5 years since mine is ER+. I chose no recon because, like several of you have mentioned, I wanted to do the least necessary. To be honest, I struggled more with the very first surgery than with the mx. On the day of my mx - June 2 - I checked in the outpatient surgery center at 8:30 a.m. and was home by 2:30 that afternoon. Even went to dinner and a car show the next day to celebrate my DH's b'day. The worst parts about the mx were that bothersome drain (in for 10 days) then the compression bra - 3 weeks. I'm 56, married for 33 years with a married son. I've never questioned my decision about the surgery. And, I agree, let your support system help. It is as much for them as for you. I have sitting on my fireplace hearth a beautiful pink and white basket that my colleagues gave me. It's filled with cards, coloring books, and dried flowers from so many caring friends and family. It's a daily reminder about how loved and blessed I am. I also have a prayer shawl knitted by some women at my church. I've taken it with me to every surgery and it's been such a comfort - especially in those cold hospital rooms! Sending up prayers for all of you as you face the many decisions and struggles ahead of you. I can't believe it's been a year since my dx. I'm glad you've found this place. It's filled with caring, up-lifting folks who are walking or have walked the path that you're currently on. Keep breathing................ Pat",
