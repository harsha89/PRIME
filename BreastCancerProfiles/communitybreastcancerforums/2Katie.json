      "Content": "Jan 9, 2012 10:48PM - edited Jan 9, 2012 10:51PM by 2Katie I'm waiting for the biopsies, I have 3 lumps according to the mammogran and the unltra sound, had a MRI, first.  I can only feel the 1 of the 3, it is about the size of an M&M peanut, I didn't know what else to compare it to.  It amazes me on this site, the use of acronyms, I don't know what they are all for, it is such a foreign language.  Wish there was a list alphabetically.  I talked to my doctor today, he is trying to schedule the biopsies this week, and surgery next week, that tells me he is very concerned. I tried to talk to my husband, he just says think posititve that was last week, I don't want to hear that.  Thinking positive, is accepting what it is and doing the best thing positive for yourself. O K I lose one or two breasts, I'd rather live. I have 2 children, and 5 grandchildren.  I have always been the type of person to take care of others, I just want someone to take over.  Is that asking to much?  I am finally enjoying life, have interests that I enjoy, I am Registrar of a chapter of the DAR. I love helping people with their applications.  I feel as if I have ventured in to a foreign country, can't  understand the language.  On this site the prognosis, section, I printed it out, think I will give it to my doctor as a test. The doctor spoke of Chemo, that must mean, I get that instead of chocolates,pretty good clue that he thinks it is the big C, Oh the big word, CANCER, sorry, I have a weird sense of humor.  Kinda avoid the subject.  Haven't told my kids, my daughter knows, I am worried, son knows nothing, nothing, nothing.  I haven't told my 3 sisters, but I can just see my one sister, plastering it all over facebook, all that garbage would be on my site.  That is all I need, having all my friends know.  I am not embarrassed by the diagnosis, I just think it is my business.  I don't want to worry, or have the pity, of others.  It was funny the day my doctor told me that he thought it maybe cancer, one of my girlfriends was talking about a friend of hers, then she mentioned she would never tell anyone if she had cancer, as people who did that wanted sympathy.  Haven't said a thing to her. Sorry if I seem so down, just still in shock.  Don't mean to bring others down.  I do think positve, just don't know how to handle everyone else in my life.  Only one girlfriend knows what I have been going thru. Thanks          ",
