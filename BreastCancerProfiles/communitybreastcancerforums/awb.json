He did use the Gail model, but stated that it was just an ESTIMATE as it wasn't really designed for LCIS, but there was no other better method for calculating my risk at the time (almost 4 years ago now). He also said that there are many factors that can increase or decrease one's overall risk (as Amy mentioned---age of periods and menopause, age at childbearing, breastfeeding, use of HRT/ birth control, smoking, obesity, drinking, etc.. some of the factors being stronger indicators than others); so that everyone's risk has to be calculated individually. In all the research I've seen, the risk is 7x to 10x for LCIS (and 3.5x to 5x for ADH/ALH) which when figured in with the lowest base rate of 5% to 6% would come out with a low of 35% to a high of 60% (if I did the math right!). Whatever the risk truly is, suffice it to say it's very high, but not quite as high as quoted for BRCA (40% to 80%). While we don't have the \"bad bc\"--invasive--requiring chemo or rads, we have our own set of special challenges and issues living with high risk that doesn't decrease over time.",

That was an excellent explaination of the process and one I think we all need to carefully think about whenever \"suspicious\" things crop up on imaging studies. Our natural first instinct is to biopsy it and \"get it out as quickly as possible\". I have LCIS and family history of bc, so am monitored very closely now with mammos alternating with MRIs every 6 months. They saw a 7 mm area of slowly enhancing nodularity on my first MRI last summer, radiologist felt is was \"probably benign\" and recommended 6 month f/u. I did not feel comfortable with the \"probably\" part, so my oncologist had me go for mammos. They turned out benign and the 2nd radiologist reviewed them as well as the MRI and agreed that everything was benign. I recently have had more benign mammos. While that 7 mm finding is still in the back of my mind, I know that MRIs are notorious for false positives, so I've chosen to trust in my medical team and their knowledge and experience with MRIs. I go for another MRI in Sept. and just hope and pray they don't find anything this time. (if so, I'll ask for biopsy if there is any question).",

Keep in mind that ALH is NOT bc (it's a precancerous condition), so there is NO rush--actually there isn't any rush even with LCIS which is more serious, since it is non-invasive.

Some doctors may even prescribe tamoxifen for prevention, but most likely only if you also have family history of bc. (I take it as I have family history and LCIS---a step further along the bc spectrum and double the risk of ADH).Feel free to PM me if you'd like. Anne",

I also took tamox for 5 years and tolerated it very well with minimal SEs; I now take evista (for almost 2 years, which is very similar to tamox in many ways, but you must be postmenopausal to take it) and tolerate it well overall. I do have some SEs (hot flashes, mild insomnia at times, achiness) but it's hard to tell what is really from the meds or what is from the loss of estrogen from my surgical menopause 6 years ago. I would suggest you try it, but it's important to know that some SEs don't show up for a few months, and then it may take your body a few months to adjust. I initially had a bad yeast infection, but gyn put me on diflucan which cleared it up and it never happened again. Just make sure to have a yearly transvaginal US to monitor both the uterine lining and the ovaries. anne",

Otherwise, they just recommend close monitoring (this is of couse after the final diagnosis--sometimes DCIS is found after excisional biopsy to remove the ADH). But if you already have implants and have very little breast tissue in front of them as you mentioned, perhaps you would want to have it removed to decrease your overall risk and then you wouldn't need tamox. It's a very personal decision. Best to talk it over with your doctor and get all your risks and benefits, so you can make an informed decision. Anne",

Just like they do with the mammos. (and the US). I was diagnosed with LCIS (a step further along the bc spectrum than ADH/ALH with double the risk level) about 7 years ago, and I also have family history of bc (mom had ILC) which further elevates my risk.  Even with that combination, at that time all my docs felt BPMs too drastic for my situation. I took tamoxifen for 5 years, now take evista and continue with my high risk surveillance of alternating mammos and MRIs every 6 months, with breast exams on the opposite 6 months.  I am doing fine with it and not ready to go the route of PBMs at this point. But, I would always reconsider the option, if needed. (actually, I've had 3 instances where I've had to briefly reconsider because of possible \"spots\" seen on my yearly MRIs, but they turned out to be nothing with further testing) It remains a very personal decision, one which we each have to make for ourselves, when we decide \"enough is enough\". The thing is, you can do close surveillance and meds and stop at anytime; mastectomies are irreversible. And yes, bc on the father's side is equally important (but considered more serious if  in a primary relative, such as mother, daughter, or sister; you'd have to ask a genetic counselor about aunts and cousins, which are secondary relatives.

The great news is that everything was BENIGN. Sounds like you are in good hands and they are keeping a close eye on things. If they had done the transvaginal US earlier (like I requested since I take tamoxifen), they might've found my cysts when they were smaller and able to remove laproscopically.

My surgical excision wasn't bad----day surgery with very little pain afterwards, had to wear a snug chest binder for 2 days and then was allowed to shower with just the steri strips remaining, was back to normal activites in less than a week.

I was diagnosed with LCIS 8.5 years ago by a similar scenario. I had suspicious microcalcifications on mammo; LCIS found on stereotactic core biopsy and  confirmed by lumpectomy. It's highly likely that nothing more serious (DCIS or invasive bc) will be found, but they are doing it to make sure there is nothing else in there with the LCIS. The procedure itself is not too bad; for me, the wire localization was similar to the SCB, only sitting up instead of laying on my stomach. They numbed me up really well, so it wasn't painful, just quite a bit of pressure. (definitely tolerable.) They taped the thin little wires and covered them with gauze, I could see them, but couldn't feel them at all due to the numbness. Into the OR within the hour. Didn't feel or remember a thing. Woke up wrapped in a snug chest binder that I couldn't remove for 2 days. Then could shower with the steri strips on after that. Very little pain if any. Different physicians feel very differently about LCIS. (still lots of controversy about it within the medical community). Even my 2 oncologists in the same office (I have a new one as one just retired) don't agree. Old one was adamant that it is cancer, just a non-invasive type (which technically it is pathologically). New one feels it is more of a high risk marker for future risk of invasive bc. I do high risk surveillance of alternating mammos and MRIs every 6 months with breast exams on the opposite 6 months, and preventative meds. (took tamoxifen for 5 years and now take evista) feel free to ask any questions, I've been dealing with this a long time. Anne ",

Generally the recommendation is for closer monitoring with mammos and breast exams; sometimes with the addition of preventative medications such as tamoxifen or evista, but that is usually if you have other significant risk factors such as family history. (both meds do have potentially serious SEs, but the risk is very low, reportedly less than 1%--I have taken both with very minimal SEs--but I have high risk from LCIS and family history, so for me the benefits outweigh the risks.)

My stereotactic core biopsy was a lot of pressure, but the breast was not painful since it was numbed up beforehand. The hardest part was having to stay so still for so long, as I have neck problems, so actually my neck was the sore area afterwards, not my breast.  They gave me a bandaid and an ice pack and I was good to go.

My lumpectomy (wide excisional biopsy) a few weeks later was day surgery--in at 6:30am, home by 2:00, had conscious sedation so didn't feel a thing and don't remember anything, except waking up in recovery wrapped in a snug chest binder.  I was allowed to remove it and shower after 2 days with the steri strips on, was back to normal activites in less than a week.",

I've been taking tamoxifen for over 3 and a half years with minimal side effects for LCIS (a step further along the bc spectrum with even higher risk); but it remains a very personal decision, one you want to be comfortable with, so take your time, no need to rush things, you've caught it very, very early.",

Eagle---try the tamox, you can always stop if you don't tolerate it well.  As long as you don't have a personal history of blood clots or a  blood clotting disorder, you aren't at a higher risk of blood clots due to your family's history. Since you are post menopausal, you could go with evista if you want. It's not quite as effective (38% versus 45%), but it also has less SEs overall.  But the fact that you haven't had any invasive bc in 18 years (with LCIS and family history) is awesome to me and wonderful news!

My surgeon said he could see more calcifications during the surgery itself and then more were seen during the pathology review microscopically. Clear margins aren't needed for LCIS as it is thought to be multifocal, multicentric and bilateral in nature. (meaning it could be everywhere, so to remove it all bilateral mastectomies would have to be done--but you don't have to \"remove it all\" since LCIS is non-invasive.) An experienced surgeon can give his best opinion, but it still will only be an opinion--no one can tell for sure until the tissue is examined by the pathologist under a microscope.

The reason for the excisional biopsy after a finding of atypical hyperplasia (ALH or ADH) is to make sure there is nothing more serious (LCIS, DCIS or invasive bc) in there along with it. The chances are high that there isn't anything else and that your diagnosis will remain ALH. The recommendation for that usually is close monitoring; sometimes with the addition of tamoxifen / evista if you have other significant risk factors such as family history of bc. Talk with your doctor about your risks and benefits for taking a preventative medication for your situation. (I have LCIS--a step further along the bc spectrum with double the risk of ALH--and family history of bc, so I do high risk management of alternating mammos and MRIs every 6 months, breast exams on the opposite 6 months, took tamox for 5 years, and now take evista for further preventative measures. anne",

If both your oncologist and your genetic NP are both recommending tamox, it must be for a good reason. I would definitely have the discussion with your doctor about risks versus benefits of taking tamox, before making any hard and fast decisions. I was diagnosed with LCIS (a step beyond ADH on the bc spectrum with double the risk) and my risk is further elevated by family history of bc (mom had ILC), and even with that combined risk (estimated at 36.6% by my oncologist, who actually said it was a \"guesstimate and could be higher\"), all my docs felt BPMs too drastic and not medically necessary. My 5-year risk on the Gail model was 4.6 (very high), so tamox was pretty much a given for me. I alternate MRIs and mammos every 6 months, took tamox for 5 years, and now have been taking evista for about 6 years for further prevention.

Is it being done abdominally or vaginally?  (I ask because the recovery and SEs are different depending on what the surgery entails). A \"partial hysterectomy\" actually means removal of the uterus, but leaving the cervix intact; a total hysterectomy removes the cervix as well, but it doesn't involve the ovaries.  An oopherectomy is removal of the ovaries). Open abdominal surgery (which is what I had--TAH/BSO--removal of uterus, cervix, tubes and ovaries) is  the most painful with at least 6 weeks recovery period. Laproscopic  surgery, done either vaginally or abdominally, has a much shorter recovery period, about 2 to 3 weeks, and generally a lot less painful. If you are having the ovaries removed as well, you will go thru immediate surgical menopause. (For me that was rough, but  I was recovering from major abdominal surgery at the same time; if you have it done by lapro surgery it should be an easier process hopefully); I had a lot of SEs, but they did level off over time and become more manageable. I really didn't care about losing the uterus (my childbearing was done a long time ago), but I really didn't want to lose the ovaries (but I didn't have much choice in the matter, they suspected ovarian cancer and my ovaries ruptured--fortunately everything turned out bening).

I have not read anything that says having both increases your risk any further, so I don't know for sure about that. I was diagnosed with LCIS (a step higher up the bc spectrum with risk of 7x to 10x) about 3.5 years ago. Initially was treated with yearly mammos, breast exams 2 to 3x a year, and tamoxifen; last summer began alternating MRIs with mammos every 6 months due to risk being further elevated by family history. Do you have any family history of bc? Are you being advised/seen by an oncologist? Perhaps they are monitoring you closely due to your age and/or family history. While stressful, it is a good thing, so if anything is found, hopefully it will be found early when it is most easily treated. Genetic testing is usually recommended when there is a strong family history involved. Talk with your doctor who should be able to help determine your overall bc risk for the future. Feel free to PM me if you'd like.",

While it does  tend to mimic some of the symptoms of menopause (hot flashes, irregular periods), it does NOT put you into premature menopause. It does have some serious SEs (endometrial cancer and blood clots), but those are very rare, reportedly  less than 1% (same for cataracts; tamox does NOT cause glaucoma). I was 46 when diagnosed with LCIS ( a non-invasive bc, stage 0) and already  had my children, so my decision was much easier. I think if I were only 31 and wanted children, I would have a long discussion with my doctor about pregnancy, risks and benefits of preventative medication, ongoing screening methods, etc... before making any hard and fast decisions.

Just remember, MRIs are very sensitive and a lot of non cancerous \"stuff\" can show up as false readings.

While it is a comfort to be watched closely, it can also be very stressful. You could talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking preventative meds (tamoxifen)--some with ADH do take it, but they may have stronger family history.

A very large ovarian mass was seen on CT scan (along with an enlarged pancreas) after I had severe abdominal pain. They did the CA-125 blood test (which by the way is a fairly unreliable test especially in premenopausal women--the numbers can be elevated for many reasons other than ovarian cancer) and a few transvaginal ultrasounds. It kept growing larger (almost 8 cm) and had to be removed as they suspected ovarian cancer. The waiting was awful--nearly 5 weeks from start to finish.  I ended up with ruptured ovarian cysts and a  TAH/BSO--the recovery and immediate surgical menopause was rough--but fortunately everything was benign. I had asked my gyn to check out my pancreas while in there, but he said my incision was too low (bikini smile) and too far from the pancreas so he couldn't see it. I had myself all worked up about the possibility of pancreatic cancer as well as ovarian cancer--none of the docs--gyn--pcp--radiologist--knew why pancreas was enlarged, but onc told me later that it is in 15% of all people. Wish I had asked him earlier--would've saved me a lot of worry! Praying you have a successful surgery and get good news soon. Anne",

I haven't totally ruled out having the testing (would go for the genetic counseling first and then decide based on their opinions, which perhaps is what you could look into), but I'm not rushing to do it. Even with our high risk with LCIS, the risk is even greater with a positive BRCA gene finding. Since I've already lost the ovaries, take tamox and am very closely monitored,  the only other step for me with a positive finding is BPMs; but it would give my sisters, daughter and nieces information that  could  be important for them.",

Not a choice for everyone, but works for me.  Anne",

It's not a choice that works for everyone, but I'm OK with it.  There's no rush to get an MRI with ALH---you had your excisional biopsy and it didn't show any invasive bc, right? Even with LCIS and family history, It took me nearly 3 years to get my oncologist on board with MRIs; he said they often lead to unecessary biopsies and the anxiety that goes along with it. I finally convinced him that I would rather put up with that than miss a possible invasive bc; fortunately I haven't had to undergo any more biopsies  in all these years (so having more biopsies is not necessarily a given). Actually, the recommendation for ALH is just yearly mammos with breast exams every 6 months, with the addition of tamoxifen IF there are other significant risk factors such as family history. But if you do decide on MRIs, try to separate it out 6 months from mammo so you are alternating them.  Feel free to PM me if you'd like. Anne",

There are definitiely lots of \"gray areas\" with LCIS and lots of controversy. All my docs (onc, gyn, pcp, bs) do consider it bc, just a non-invasive type, but there are many in the medical community who only consider it a marker for higher risk of invasive bc in the future. I personally don't care about the controversy and what they call it anymore, as long as I get the monitoring and treatment that I need.

I finished up my full 5 years of tamox about 3 months ago; fortunately I tolerated it pretty well overall.  There are risks of serious SEs such as blood clots and endometrial cancer, but those are reportedly very rare, occuring at less than 1% of the time. Tamox is generally well tolerated by most with the most common SE being hot flashes. I was also 46 with 2 teenagers at the time of my diagnosis. I wanted to be proactive in trying to prevent an invasive bc in my future. Thus far, I have done very well with no more biospies/lumpectomies needed and am very closely monitored with digital mammos and MRIs alternating every 6 months. My mom took tamox many years ago and also tolerated it very well; which factored into my decision---she is now a survivor of over 22 years without a recurrence. So, for us, tamox has worked very well.  Anne",

I did put everything on hold for a while while I sorted things out--saw a surgeon and oncologist, had a lumpectomy, started on tamoxifen, and did TONS of research--had just lost my job prior to diagnosis, so had lots of free time! Actually, thought about it almost obsessively for a time, even with the distractions of a new job and family obligations. I still find myself thinking about it/spending more time worrying about it than I should; especially when a mammo or MRI is coming up or a doctor visit.  Actually just had my 6 month f/u with oncologist yesterday and we had this very same conversation. He knows I'm a worrier, he always trys to reassure me that I'm being watched so closely, that if anything ever developed, it would be found very early. (I have MRIs alternating with mammos every 6 months, see him every 6 months on opposite schedule, so actually \"checked\" by sombody every 3 months--that does help to give me more peace of mind).  The plan now is for me to go on Evista after I finish my 5 years of tamox (in 4 months) and he also wants me to go for genetic counseling and testing (I also have family history which increases my risk even further).  I have been OK  with the tamox (only mild SEs--mainly hot flashes) and close surveillance; but it is very individual--I think it depends on how much risk you can live with comfortably.  I figure I will deal with it, whatever it is, IF the time comes. I don't know if faith plays a part in your life, but it is what has helped me the most of anything ( I get a lot of support and comfort from prayer (my own and those of others that pray for me) and attend healing services occasionally to help me live with the stress of high risk). We all have to find something that works for us. One gentleman told me recently, \"instead of waiting for the other shoe to drop, why not put on the shoe and dance?\" So I try to remind myself of that and try and live life to the fullest.

Provided only ADH is found during your lumpectomy (which is much more likely than not), they will probably just recommend close monitoring with yearly mammos and twice yearly breast exams; ( possibly US or MRI due to your history of density) and possibly tamoxifen or evista.  It's nice to hear of someone being downgraded to something less serious! (too often we hear stories here of people being upgraded to more serious situations). I know the idea of close monitoring doesn't sound very appealing right now, but think of it this way: if the diagnosis is DCIS, you would be closely monitored, probably need radiation and tamox; if only ADH, you won't need the radiation, and maybe not even the tamox.  I do high risk surveillance and take preventative meds (tamox, now evista) due to LCIS (diagnosed over 7 years ago) and family history of ILC.

I am very closely monitored with mammos and MRIs alternating every months, BSEs, CBEs, and have been taking tamoxifen as a preventative for almost 4 years. I have not been genetically tested yet, oncologist feels I'm pretty low risk for BRCA. But I can speak to the immediate surgical menopause. (I had to have a total abdominal hysterectomy 2 years ago due to rupture of large ovarian cysts.) I had been having mild SEs from the tamox (hot flashes, insomnia, achiness) which all significantly increased after the loss of the ovaries, but while annoying, are still manageable. Some changes I noticed right away, most others came on gradually over 3 or 4 months time. I had already had my children and I was nearing the age of natural menopause anyway (almost 48), but it still was a difficult decision to make.(I had no choice about the one ovary, but decided to let him take both (and uterus, cervix, and tubes) as I didn't want to chance going thru it again; and he was suspicious of ovarian cancer at the time, but fortunately everything turned out benign). I was in the hospital 2 nights and 3 days and out of work for 8 weeks, but if you have the ovaries removed laproscopically, it is a much shorter and easier recovery.

I don't know if they would remove the gallbladder at the same time--I asked about the appendix, since you don't really need it, and they said insurance doesn't let them remove a healthy organ for no reason. But your surgery would be longer anyway as they would be repairing the hernia, and definitely longer if they remove the gallbladder and revise your breast.",

Also, no nausea, grogginess, or sore throat that comes with general anesthesia/ intubation.  I had local numbing for the wire localization which took place about an hour before my surgery. No pain really, just a lot of pressure (like the stereotactic core biopsy if you've had one of those).",

No atypia--that's great news! It sounds like everything is benign. No need to worry about the hyperkeratosis either. Anne ",

Your family history and use of HRT are both risk factors for bc, but I've never heard that Lupus or long term prednisone use are risk factors. (I've been on prednisone many times--in fact I was restarted on it today--but never have I read that it was a risk for bc). Praying you get good benign results soon. Anne",

At that time, they gave me a 5-year risk of 4.6%, and a lifetime risk of 36.6%.  I had lumpectomy, took tamoxifen for 5 years; now have been taking evista for about 4 years, and I continue with high risk surveillance of alternating mammos and MRIs every 6 months with breast exams on the opposite 6 months. A \"minute focus\" just means a very small area of ALH was found; in theory, it should mean a lower level of risk than if an extensive area was detected, although ALH can be bilateral (just as LCIS is bilateral). They often use above a 5-year risk of 1.6% as a recommendation for tamoxifen use; but there are a lot of things to consider when deciding to take it.  It is more concerning when you have ALH with a family history of bc (in a primary relative, like mother, sister, daughter) than when you don't. So depending on what is making your risk #s so high, it may be very prudent of you to consider taking tamox. I tolerated it well (as I do the evista), but I would recommend you have a yearly transvaginal US to monitor both the uterine lining and the ovaries. anne",
