      "Content": "slg91324 wrote: I found a lump about a month ago.  I was fully expecting that once the doctor felt it, he would tell me that it was nothing to worry about.  Instead he scheduled me with a mammo and a consult with a surgeon.  Went for the mammo last week and he called the next day to say that I needed to go in for a compression analysis and that when I met with the surgeon on Monday he would probably do a biopsy.  After the first appointment I was a mess.  After a lot of research, I know that the statistics are still in my favor, but I have too many friends who had the same low risk history as me and who had cancer.  Thankfully, they are all healthy today. I go back and forth between being totally fixated on what if, trying not to let myself think bad thoughts and having faith that if I get a diagnosis, it will just be the next curve in the road. I guess tonight, I just feel a little alone.  I am not worried about tomorrow in and of itself.  But I am worried about being thrust into the hands of a series of strangers who I don't trust to give me the information I need.  The waiting sucks, the impersonalization sucks and the thought that this might be just the beginning really sucks. Anyway, Ladies thank you for being a non-judgemental sounding board. Log in to post a reply",
