I talked with a few different radiologists before I had my breast MRI (with contrast), and they all told me the same as what djmammo says above. I suggest you try to call the place that will perform the MRI, and talk with them about it directly. You might have to do some digging to get the right phone number, and you might have to wait for a radiologist or technician to call you back, but hopefully you can get some of these questions answered in the next couple of days.",
