She was able to tell me grade and hormone receptivity. She is reluctant to discuss staging until she has the whole picture, and even then, after surgery, they can always find out more. My doctor couldn't give staging information until more tests were completed. I just had an MRI last week, which showed the tumor to be nearly twice the size they originally thought it was. I have to go for a PET scan on Wednesday and after the results of that, she said they will have a pretty good idea on staging. Staging is harder to determine from a biopsy, so you may need additional tests to find out how big it really is. The biopsy is only showing a small sample from a small area. Waiting is the hardest. But not all doctors know what information to give. I live in a small town, so my first dr (the only breast surgeon around) did not specialize in breast cancer. He didn't order any additional testing (blood work, MRI, PET, etc) and he didn't know what information was available, even when I asked. This may not be your same situation, but always consider getting a second opinion. Not every doctor knows everything. I am now working with a team of doctors, not just one...and I trust a team approach much more than a single health professional.",

Mine had spread to the lymph nodes, but not to any organs, bones, etc and they didn't even know that until after the surgery results came back.

That way you can know either way and wont be worrying for months and months. I had a palpable lump that did not show up on mammogram or ultrasound. The breast specialist said it was 'probably' nothing and didn't recommend biopsy, esp because of my age (29 at the time). I don't have a strong family history of breast cancer, so I let it go. I've also had fibroadenomas in each breast since I was a teenager, so I was never really overly concerned about a new lump. Well, here I am 31 with stage III breast cancer. If I'd pushed for a biopsy 2 years ago, my treatment may not have been so aggressive now...and let me tell you, chemo is no joke and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Good Luck, and I hope everything works out for you!",

I'd always had fibroadenomas, so I was familiar with lumps and bumps, but this one felt differently. It was more of a 'thickening' than a lump and was causing an indentation in the skin. When I first found it, I followed up with Mammogram and US, which showed nothing, and they seemed to kind of brush me off because of my age. Fast forward to this year, the 'thickening' was getting larger and so was the indentation and now the nipple was turning outwards. I was also very small breasted, so even minor changes were evident, which I am so thankful for! 2. Please describe to me what exactly your lump felt like to you or your doctor. Mine felt like tissue under the skin, maybe like a scar or something. As mentioned before, I'd always had 2-3 fibroadenomas, which are kind of rubbery and slippery and move very easily. This one was not rubbery or slippery. You could move it, but not as easily. 3. Is there a family history? Yes, my maternal aunt, however, genetic testing has since indicated it is not likely related.",

I don't know if I can answer all of your questions correctly, but I will answer them based off my own experiences and understandings. 1) I'm wondering how whether its unusual to fine IDC (or other) at some point after an initial DCIS/LCIS diagnosis; For me, my lump of IDC was found and during surgery, they found areas of DCIS and LCIS. From what my surgeon explained, these are tiny areas that have not broken out of the cell and become invasive. My understanding is that the DCIS/LCIS is the first step and as it grows, it invades the surrounding tissue to form a lump. They could find IDC after surgery, but if the largest amounts they are finding is DCIS/LCIS, I would be comfortable with that diagnosis. Of course, with the dense breasts, I would really push for more testing and imaging. Just keep in mind, they won't have all of the information until after surgery, whether it is a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. 2) Why would the pathology report recommend an MRI for staging? Aren't DCIS and LCIS always considered stage 0? Or would this be because they need to rule out invasive cells in order to confirm Stage 0? Do all DCIS/LCIS patients have an MRI? Yes, I believe DCIS/LCIS are considered stage 0. Generally, they cannot stage definitively until after surgery. I would push for an MRI, regardless though. 3) Would invasive cells always show up on MRI, or are there cancers that do not show up on MRI? No. I was told my lymph nodes were clean based on imaging (CT scans and MRI). After surgery and biopsy of the lymph nodes, cancer was discovered in 3 of 4 of the lymph nodes removed. I hope this helps!",

Did you follow up after the mammo and US with a breast surgeon? If not, I would ask to do so. Then they should be able to recommend a biopsy. When I first went, they said a biopsy wasn't recommended, but if I could redo that, I would have asked for one anyways.

I received IV anti-nausea meds beforehand, which are supposed to stay in your system 5 days. About 3 hours after the treatment the nausea set it. The rest of the night was just nausea, vomiting, headache, and blurry vision. My treatment was on Thursday, and I was unable to return to work until Tuesday. But by Wednesday/Thursday the SEs really started to subside and by Friday, I felt pretty normal again. I have not lost my hair yet and am not experiencing any shedding yet. My next treatment is Nov 1, and I hope I am better prepared mentally to handle it, now that I have an idea of what it entails. Edited to add: I also had constipation and sleepiness. I've also gained about 5-8 pounds, but I am wondering if that is from the steroids? I've been very bloated. I did have to go to the clinic for fluids and more steroids. If anyone has insight on weight gain and how to avoid it, I would appreciate it! I don't think I am eating anymore than normal, but maybe the lethargy can really take its toll!",

I also had really bad morning sickness with all three of my children, which I've heard those people have a harder time with Chemo side effects. I will talk to my dr within the next couple weeks and see what we can come up with. Regardless of if I continue the AC regimen, I will def try the fasting with whatever comes next. My current treatment plan was mostly based off my age (31), so they wanted to be aggressive from the start; but IDK if we need to be quite so aggressive LOL.",

For those who have fasted, did you eat/drink ANYTHING, or just water? Yesterday I was starving and had a few bites of boiled chicken and today I had an apple. But just wondering if you eat anything, does it completely ruin it? I've been fasting (aside from the chicken/apple) since Sunday afternoon, so 48 hours. I've never fasted before, so this has been a little difficult, but not near as bad as I expected. But, even as I type this, my stomach is GROWLING!!! LOL",

I have no clue why though! For me, the 4th treatment for some reason had the most mild side effects, although they were still pretty brutal. B74 - My nurses were always shocked at how fast I started having symptoms too. I would leave the clinic around 1 or 2pm and by 5 or 6, side effects would kick in full force with violent vomitting. I finished my 4th treatment about 3 weeks ago, but after every single one, I said I wasn't going back. Side Effects were awful and lasted 5-6 days at the worst before I started to feel better. I was bed-ridden most of that time. I now have nausea just thinking about going to the cancer center even if it's just for blood work. If I even look at my chemo bag, I swear I get nauseous. I know it's probably psychological, but still! I don't know if I'll ever be the same. I start taxol on Wednesday and they say the nausea isn't as bad, but I know I'll be nauseous before it even starts....As beeline says, it must be anticipatory!",

The fatigue is already debilitating, so taking meds that also cause fatigue makes it so much worse! Once I switched to Zofran, it was much better. I also ended up getting dissolving anti nausea meds, because the first few days after each treatment, I couldn't keep the pills down. So for anyone going thru AC now, if one med doesn't work, ASK for something else!! I suffered through 2 treatments before I realized there were other meds I can try! The doctors/nurses won't always tell you there's other options. ",
