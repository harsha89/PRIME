Then after surgery (excisional biopsy) they were 95% sure I was fine! Then it started getting worse from there... 7 days later, confirmed IDC. Pathology said \"at least stage 1c.\" MRI showed two other spots \"light up\" then w/ second look ultrasound those were confirmed too... look very suspicious but tiny 2mm and 5mm. During that ultrasound they asked if I wanted them to scan my nodes. I said yes. Multiple nodes looked abnormal. Had fine needle aspiration of one node which confirmed there is cancer in the nodes. ICK! I am just praying so hard that this doesn't turn out to be metastatic!! I need to be here a loooooong time. I'm 36 and otherwise healthy and feel I can do ANYTHING but the highest stage. I'm really nervous 15% of the time and relying on God, staying positive and FAITH FAITH FAITH Double mastectomy 2/15 with all the nodes coming out on my left side because of this one positive node. So far I am IDC and DCIS ER/PR+ Her2-, grade 1 mitoic rate 1 Anyone start with a simliar story to mine??
