So I decided to close my eyes. After laying there awhile I felt this presence. I opened my eyes and the male tech for standing there with a marker getting ready to mark me up some more. I'm sure I jumped. He asked if he startled me. I told him yes. He said I walk very lightly. I told him he was very quiet when he came up to me. He drew on me some more and then took pictures of my marked up breast. I was happy when it was over and I could cover up. He gave me some wipes to clean up. I tried to clean the blue marker and it just seemed to smear. I felt like I looked like I had a blue smurf breast. Today I got up and was ready for my 2nd treatment.

I got my tattoos and blue marker all over my breast. Not the cutest look. My first treatment is March 7th. Not the best time of day but hoping after that the times will work better with work.",

The techs said they would be working this weekend but I have games and church so I can't make it so it will be added on to the end. My skin was just starting to get irritated last weekend so I'm sure the time off helped things not to get too bad.",

They have been running about 45 minutes to a hour late since I started. They always apologies but it is frustrating. Today I got there and no one was waiting. I was called back within 3 minutes. I was in and out before my appointment time. It was great. I came into work and because our Metro system closed down today everyone seemed to drive. I had to drive around 20 minutes to find a place to park. I still got into work before I have been the last 5 rad days.",
