I bought two wigs before my hair fell out so that I could match the color.  My mistake was buying wigs that were longer, like my own hair.  Guess what happens when you put your purse or laptop bag on your shoulder???  Yep, you can pull the wig right off your head.  After a few times of that, I stuck mainly with scarves and hats.  I bought some of the soft caps from headcoverings.com.  I found the ones made out of soft material (like thick tee shirt material)  irritated my head less.  The wigs were also very scratchy and uncomfortable even though they had lace caps.  I know how hard it is to go through this, but you will make it.  You have to do whatever it takes to make yourself comfortable.  You can always vent here. Saralmom - Your hair looks awesome!  Very fetching.  Cat123 - You should do whatever you are comfortable with as well.  My previous comments were from my own experience....others didn't care nearly as much as I did!   That was an eye opener!",

The real issue is that my DH and I were planning to go to Paris for our 20th in Jan.  I was diagnosed mid Nov, had dmx in Dec and started chemo 24 Feb.  We cancelled the trip for Jan.  My DH is now going to Paris for work in Sep and I have graciously volunteered to go with him!  Hah!  I really do NOT want to deal with hat/scarves/wigs on that trip.  I want to be back to my old self.  Anyone think that is possible?",

Bravo!  My hair has finally stopped falling out (for the second time).  Someone asked me today how much I had and I didn't know how to answer.  I am not pulling a precious hair out to measure and they are kind of kinky.  So I just put a ruler againt my scalp and measured my hair depth.  Tomorrow I will be 5 weeks PFC and I have 1/2 inch of hair depth.  I am also exhibiting the male patterned baldness, just like many of you others. I am making progress though. ladym13 - your hair is adorable!  tsundermann - I would be curious to see how much growth you have at 12 weeks?  I will be 12 weeks when I go on vacation and really want to go topless. I have a recommendation for brows.  I get the tinted brow gel at Bobbi Brown and it stays put all day in the Alabama heat, AND it tames the elf like twirls I now have at the apex of my brows...* Sigh*. ",

I also had a terrible experience with the look good feel better program. We did not get scarves or wigs, nor did the instructor have any scarves to even show us how to tie them. All.of my eye makeup and lip colors were orange or green and all of products in the kit were expired. I threw the whole kit away. I am 5 weeks pfc and my hair is growing. Did any of you who have hair remember your scalp itching when it started too really grow?",
