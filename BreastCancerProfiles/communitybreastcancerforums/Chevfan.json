In addition to the fibrocysts, I have atypical ductal hyperplasia. I just looked at all my path reports and couldn't find any initial measurement (from the mammo) to compare to yours. But when I ended up with the surgical biopsy, my surgeon took out a 5 cm X something piece of tissue to get it all. That was just last month (5/4) that I had the 3rd surgical biopsy. I go back Sept. or Oct. for followup scans. I think the only side effect was I can no longer spell, LOL! ",

I had a birads of 4, and had calcifications in the left breast that were biopsied. I actually had 3 biopsies to the left breast and ended up with a dx of atypical ductal hyperplasia. I've got calcifications on my right breast as well but they aren't suspicious as of yet. It's so scary, I agree .... but, I think you'll be/do fine. I'm also small breasted and skinny and the biopsy worked. (Are they giving you a stereotactic biopsy?) It took some wriggling around and positioning, but they got it, the geniuses. Fibrocysts for me, too. The waiting part is horrible, taking action is actually pretty helpful.",

I had a stereotactic biopsy and a needle aspiration biopsy on the same day. That led to the surgical biopsy couple of weeks later. I didn't get a 2nd opinion. At this point, I'm comfortable with the diagnosis. I was downgraded to ADH due to pathology, my surgeon originally thought it might be DCIS. I figure even if DCIS was missed, it won't make too much of a difference since I'm getting scans again soon. (What an attitude, LOL!)",

Really, do what they say and take it easy afterwards. I had a stereotactic in April and it wasn't really all that bad. Do you know how it all happens? You lay on your tummy on a table with a hole in it. You can guess what goes in the cleverly placed hole.  It's like a mammogram machine that holds you in place (you have to lie very still) and, like you've been told ... you are numb, while a radiologist (or something I can't remember!) takes the samples. The cool thing is, you cannot begin to see what's going on under there. Honestly, I nearly fell asleep. Now, I did have some fuzzy results so I had to have a surgical biopsy (asleep in an OR) but it all came back B9! I think you'll do fine. If you're freaking out before the biopsy, just tell them! They can send a nurse to give you some calming meds. Trust me, they do it all time.  Praying for good results! ",

So, I've been pondering some stuff (and I don't know why) but here goes: I understand that nodes are removed and tested either negative or positive. Other than staging, why are they removed at all? Does it really help slow the spread if positive nodes are removed? Just doing a proactive mulling over of all this. You know, back in April the BS thought I might come back DCIS. At that point, I was just off the cuff with \"off they go if so\". Now, I'm not so sure. Been reading about lymphedema and it feels like a sad trade off for some reason. Guess I'm just wondering what good surgery actually does if you are dx with IDC and are going to get chemo and rads anyway? P.S. I'm fine, just very anal. I gotta' think this stuff out far ahead when I get the chance. :)  Julie ... 5/10 ADH Log in to post a reply",
