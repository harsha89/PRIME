My treatment plan is 5 months of Chemo, Surgery and Radiation. Chemo is divided into two phase. First phase - once in every two week for 8 weeks , second phase - every week for 12 weeks. I completed the first phase and AC was the Chemo med that they used. My second phase will start from next week. First day of Chemo was horrible. I had very bad nausea and vomiting. After taking two anti-nausea back to back helped me to get sleep. According to doctor and from online posts, Taxol will have less side effects. I am looking forward for the second phase of my Chemo. Hair started to fall after 2nd treatment so I shaved all of my hair. Lately I have been seeing skin discoloration and dryness. Any tips on how can I take care of the skin discoloration. I have been reading this posts and getting lot of tips so thank you for that to everyone. Good luck to everyone and my best wishes are always with everyone of us. ",
