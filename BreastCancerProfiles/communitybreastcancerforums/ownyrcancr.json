But a local BRONJ expert at Kaiser (I am not a Kaiser patient) recommended a specific oral surgeon there, & I have been trying to get an appointment to no avail since. So I  am still needing ideas for a BRONJ expert oral surgeon in the SF area if anyone can help. My jaw hurts a lot now & I have a new sore spot, so I am getting desperate. If no local references, maybe someone has specific referrals elsewhere (LA? Seattle?) Appreciate any help anyone can give.",

It seems to be early stage, & X-Ray studies not characteristic. My local oral surgeon is neither knowledgeable or very interested. I would appreciate any experiences/ideas/referrals from people with same diagnosis who found helpful specialists, especially in greater San Francisco area. I hated to give up my Zometa-the followup bone marrow biopsy showed a drop in metastatic breast cancer cells from 10% to \"rare scattered cells\" after the yr of Tx. My only other treatment has been Arimidex-stopped chemo after one Taxol-Cytoxin dose due to severe marrow suppression. PET/CT remains no evidence of disease. Log in to post a reply",
