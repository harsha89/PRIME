      "Content": "Susan-33 wrote: I was diagnosed with stage 4 (bone involvement), in October, at first diagnosis, mastectomy: 12/19, and first treatment with arimidex not until 1/1/12. No radiation, despite some margin problem in the surgery, the reason given was: it may cause the reconstruction to fail, or it may cause more risk of lymphedema, (while I think that is very concerning, I am actually more concerned with the cancer.) 15 of 18 lymph nodes involved.  This was lobular, which I could not detect, the largest area 4cm.  Immediately after mastectomy,  I started watching for skin changes, and I am seeing darkening of a rash like area above the mastectomy area, where a small second cancer was removed from very near the chest. I have been advised by the radiation oncologist (whom I consulted), to watch this area carefully, but every time I bring up the subtle changes in the rash to the primary oncologist, she tries to convince me it is \"winter skin\", or an allergic reaction to the tissue expander===it IS subtle, but I want to attempt to do something if possible, before any major change.  So, now I have brought this up with rad onc, nurse practitioner, and regular oncologist, and have been dismissed, but last night I definitely see a darkening of the rash in the spot with the bad margin. I called the oncologist again today, and she will see me tomorrow, but now I find out that she has taken no tumor markers, to even be aware if the arimidex is starting to work.  So, does anyone have any ideas about what I should insist on when I see her tomorrow am?  I think it would have been appropriate for her to have some way of determining if a treatment is working, objectively, like with tumor markers, since I have just had scans and mri in November and December, and that did show bone involvement. Should I consider going off of hormonal and on to chemo after a total of  only one month on arimidex, for a slight darkening of a rash area, which I do suspect to be skin involvement?  Are there any other tests of receptors to determine what is driving this cancer? It was ER/PR positive and Heu negative, just over a month ago. Is it unusual for an oncologist not to assess tumor markers to be aware of when a treatment is working or not working? My cancer does have a high nuclear grade, all of the more reason I believe that the oncologist should be looking a tumor markers, and molecular markers of the cancer, besides just ER/PR.  Thanks in advance for your feedback, sorry there are so many questions.  Susan Log in to post a reply",

My calcium level was low, the bone issue was all additive, not subtractive, and no pain. My oncologist says it is an odd presentation.",

Of course that is not true, and these boards see people all the time going to recurrence, the real question is what is the probability, I have seen 20+% and higher? I think that is something which is being swept under the rug, and the politics of denial by the system is the reason. All of the stages, together, should be demanding a cure, but the current overriding policy of denial and delusion about prevention being a cure, also fear, keeps the stage 1-3 people from demanding that this disease be cured. Once someone has a recurrence, they might  feel like they should have been advocating for a cure, all along?",
