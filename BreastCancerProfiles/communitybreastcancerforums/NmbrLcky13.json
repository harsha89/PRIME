The doctor said that the tumor has taken over most of my breast tissue that I'm going to have to have a mastectomy, because it will just keep getting bigger. Yesterday I went in and had another Breast biopsy. They had to put me under for that one because they had to take a bigger tissue sample this time. This was the first time I had surgery. Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Everyone was so kind to me and made it alot easier for me. I should get the results back for that in a week. Doctor said there is a slight chance it will come back and say it will be cancer. I have a follow up appointment on July 6th. I want to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, and for their kind and encouraging word !!!!",
