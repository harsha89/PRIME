      "Content": "wambles wrote: Hello Ladies.. Ive been absent for a while, as I've been pretty much in the thick of things, surgery & treatment wise, as well as some very intense personal & family issues. I'm really after some advice On Monday, December 1st, I had a bilateral salpingo oophorectomy. This was done laparoscopically (sp) Prior to the surgery, I had been getting monthly zolodex shots for 4 months, and had tried arimidex (as I'm intolerant tamoxifen - I am - or was - premenopausal) I had to stop arimidex too, as it made me very sick. Zolodex gave me quite noticable hot flashes, but nothing much else in the way of side effects. Immediately following the surgery, I had not a single hot flash for the 1st few days, and silly me... Thought, wow! I'll take this... The pain from surgery was quite bad, much worse than I expected, but I figured it would soon pass. Almost 2 weeks out now, and I'm a mess. Around day 4.. The hot flashes returned with gusto! Soooo much more intense, and occurring literally every ten minutes or so.. Day and night. A single sip of coffee, the slightest exertion, even just turning over in bed, has me sweating like I've just run a full marathon. Absolutely no exaggeration, it's miserable. The pain from surgery is still there, no where near as bad as immediately afterwards, but a dull constant ache, with sudden sharpness, despite high dose codeine. My incisions however, have healed to being barely noticeable. And the horror that is my stomach!! It's swollen to 3 times the size it was, with no signs of deflating. I realise that the gas they use to inflate you inside, plus surgery swelling will cause this to a degree, but really??? I look about to give birth! Which in itself would be a medical miracle, without the surgery, but... Lets not go there :-) I would really love to hear from anyone who has been through or is going through recovery from this surgery and has any tips for me. Particularly regarding the hot flashes, and swelly belly.. Because right now all I want to do is curl up in bed and never resurface. Oh and I started femera yesterday (!) with anti nausea meds as a chaser.. I am also awaiting a repeat MRI on my pelvis. To check 2 spots in my bones that appear abnormal. This will be done Jan 8th..

I'm very much isolated as I suffer from social phobia, due in most part to a past abusive relationship. It got to a point where when I was originally diagnosed in 2010 I was unable to complete my radiation therapy as the stress of travelling 5 days a week for treatment became intolerable. Tamoxifen made my condition worse as it upped my anxiety levels, so I came off of that too. Now I'm here 4 years later with a recurrence and of course I blame myself, though all of my doctors have assured me that no one can tell WHY the recurrence happened and to go easier on myself. Thankfully my anxiety meds have been tweaked over the years to the point where I'm now much better able to cope with all the hoo hah that's happening now. Morwenna, (hope I got that right, daren't go back to check) I lived in Bognor Regis for some years before moving along the coast to where I am now, so yes I know Worthing well. All of Sussex is beautiful I think. I'm originally from a town just north of London and I have to say, I don't miss it one little bit!!! Anyway, I hope everyone's in good spirits today. My day is just beginning and hopefully at some point I'll get to post my diagnosis gubbings and sort out an avatar. We shall see. Hugs W xx",

One thing that did give me a giggle.. Do I live in Wimbledon.. ? Wasn't that the wombles? Cute furry things living in a field? Whilst I may not wax my legs often enough it's been a long time since I've been referred to as cute. Haha.. I actually live on the south coast, in east Sussex.. Apparently we get the most hours of sunshine on average in England. Which being England doesn't really say a lot!!

Am awaiting results STILL from my MRI. Here in England seems to take much much longer than US. I have been badgering my BC nurse with emails and she tells me she will find out tomorrow during some kind of meeting, and let me know. Bout flipping time, too! Grrr. Pelvic ultrasound on Thursday, to look at ovaries and uterus. Although I've already had a pre op for oophorectomy, I have no surgery date as yet. All seems a bit topsy-turvy to me. Again, oh well.

Please, no one take offence, I mean it in a loving way. The reasons I chose to post here are simple. Edi, the only UK gal iv come across so far, who over the last few months while iv been coming to terms with my new diagnosis (recurrence of IDC from 2010, double mast, hormone torture etc.. More on that another time) has given me countless giggles with her antics and anecdotes. Really, ALL u ladies here have had me laughing and crying along with you for months now, this thread has read like a book iv not been able to put down and I want to thank each and every one of you. My only regret is that the thread founder seems to have disappeared, so I never got the chance to thank her. Bennys story touched my heart as I'm certain it has many others, and I sincerely hope she is doing well and is happy 😊 I think that's enough for now, I hope everyone here, wherever in the world you are, has a great day/evening/night and finds peace and sunshine in your hearts.
