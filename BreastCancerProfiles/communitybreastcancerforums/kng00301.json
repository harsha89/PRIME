She said she didn't feel a mass, I probably had a papilloma, and she wanted me to get an ultrasound. I went in for the ultrasound and they saw a fairly large mass (I'm not sure if it was close to the nipple or not, but I think it was), one that wasn't palpable from a BE though, and scheduled me for a biopsy. They also told me that I will likely have to have surgery to remove all of the mass. I know that the biopsy is ultrasound guided and will be either a VA or core, but they didn't specify which. Should I be worried? How likely is it that this mass is cancer? Is this procedure very painful? I'm worried they won't give me enough lidocaine and it'll be the most painful thing I've ever felt! I'm such a baby when it comes to pain, and I'm absolutely terrified of both the procedure and the results! Thanks for any help, I'm super scared and I'd really appreciate any advice!
