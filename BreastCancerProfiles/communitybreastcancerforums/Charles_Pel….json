Were it not, we'd never see those hideous comb-overs. I never had that problem and went from a full head of hair to being as bald as a cue ball. It was a strange experience, but it did offer up a few funny moments when people who hadn't seen me for a while either didn't recognize me or would loudly proclaim \"hey, you cut off your hair! How come?\"  I tried to minimize their discomfort when I told them why, but I did get a kick out their reactions. I didn't do anything about my eyebrows, but man-oh-man, I am happy they are back. As for my current attire, yeah, I do look pretty damn stuffy these days. You'd never believe I had waist-length hair back in the 70s (and yeah, I think I inhaled, too).    1979 vs. 2011: The ravages of time ... and chemo ",

I am grateful for the site, for the discussion forums, all of the information that I found helpful during chemo and the many friends I made here (I admit that most of those friends are women). I do think it may be time, though, to scrub the gender-specific nature of some sections (not all) largely because merely adding men in as an after-thought tends to reinforce the perception that only women develop (and die from) breast cancer. I was pained, for example, when I read the December 24, 2012 issue of Time magazine, because an otherwise terrific article on genetic risks made the same egregious error. In a discussion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, the author began a key sentence with \"Women with the BRCA mutations ....\" At this point, I know first-hand that it's not just women. By the way, in hopes of not sounding like I am whining all the time, I do want to mention that it's been a year since chemo was wrapped up. Check-ups are good and that picture on my profile is way out-dated. My blood count is back to normal, my hair is back, the ugly effects of Taxol are gone and I feel pretty good for a 55-year-old guy ... who is damn grateful for the fact that he's made it this far.",

I only raise the BRCA issue, because it directly relates to my cancer. All of those risk factors are serious and affect both men and women. farmerlucydaisy I think it may well be worth his getting it checked out. If a parent is BRCA2 positive, you stand a 50/50 chance of being so yourself. I encouraged my sister and several of my cousins to get tested. Fortunately for them, they came up negative.

Had I been diagnosed before school, I am not sure I would have had the guts to take it on while I was going through chemo, but knowing what I know now I would most certainly do it.

That, coupled with serious problems with neuropathy, caused my oncologist to pull me off four weeks early.  I was happy, since I got Christmas off. I am now getting back on track. Now the only barriers to regular rides are work (I had to work through chemo, but now have to work extra to make up for lost time) and weather. I plan on riding a lot this week.",

One really awful thing that chemo did to me was make me incredibly sensitive to cold. I used to spend winters skiing in the back country and even riding in sub-zero weather. This past winter, I spent most of my time curled up in front of the fire place.  Anyway, weather is no longer a barrier (or excuse), my increasing red cell count seems to have addressed the sensitivy issue and the bikes are ready to roll.",
