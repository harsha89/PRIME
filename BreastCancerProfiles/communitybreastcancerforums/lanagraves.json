I am not triple positive, nor am I Stage II, but I remember how very overwhelming and devastating those first few weeks were. I did surgery, then chemo and rads - I'm just finishing up rads now, or will be next week. Depending on your philosophy of treatment, one thing I wish I had asked my onc from the beginning is how he felt about clinical trials and \"outside the box\" treatment. I really like him, but he and I have butted heads a bit because he is very rigid about treating only inside the standard guidelines. For example, at Stage IIIA, I wanted to take Zometa (a biophosphonate that strengthens bones and has shown some promise in preventing recurrence) as an added \"insurance\". However, he would not make the case to my insurance company to do so, because Zometa is not indicated as treatment for my particular stats. Also, many oncs will prescribe the diabetes drug, Metformin,Â even thought its off-label, to BC patients if they request it, because it has shown promise as well and has few side effects. He refuses this also. Thus far, I have won a few battles and he has won a few. I like and respect him well enough to continue allowing him to treat me; however, there may come a time that we come to an impasse regarding my treatment. If so, I will have to start all over building a relationship with a new onc. I wish I had thought of this in the beginning, and asked those questions up front. Sending healing thoughts your way. Let me know if I can answer any questions. This is a great forum, with alot of knowledgeable and wonderful ladies. I don't know what I would have done without them over the past few months.",

The 16 year old starts college today (not sure if I'm happy or sad, but certainly proud). I was dx'd in February of 2012 at Stage IIIA. After chemo, I began to have rib pain and an x-ray was done. I had fractured a rib, but the xray also showed a single lesion on one of my right ribs. I finished RADS and a repeat xray was done. The lesion was still there but unchanged. After two months on Tamox, the lesion disappeared, but new nodes in my chest wall began to light up. My MO doesn't know if these nodes are malignant, and they are not in a place where a biopsy can be obtained. For now, I am scheduled for a repeat scan in April.",

Then, on the same day I found out my PET scan was clear (hallelujah!!!), I started A/C treatments. So now, I almost feel guilty for feeling bad after chemo - I mean, I should be on cloud 9 after clear scan results, right?

I had an experience I had in Wal-Mart over the weekend I hope never to repeat.Â  I apparently have an uncanny propensity to attract every wacko at Wal-Mart anyway, but there must have been a full moon this weekend. I was in Wal-Mart doing my least favorite chore - grocery shopping, and I noticed this lady staring at me. I haven't worn anything on my head in a couple of months, so I had to think for a minute to realize why she was staring. Then she just walks up to me and, very directly, says: So do you have cancer? I was a little taken aback, but decided to be tolerant, so I said yes, I did, but, according to my scans, I am cancer-free now. That just seems to be the easiest way to explain it quickly and simply without details. Then why are you taking treatment, she said. I told her that I was locally advanced and had some lymph node involvement, and that's why my MO wanted to do chemo and radiation, to kill any remaining cancer cells that could not be seen on scans. She said, so is that supposed to take care of it forever, or you just don't know. I said, well, no one really knows, do they. I have done everything I can to prevent a recurrence and that's the best I can do. So did they tell you about all the horrible things chemo and radiation can do to your body, she asked. At this point, I was tired, already irritated that I had to go grocery shopping, andÂ becoming much less tolerant. So, out of the blue, before I could answer, she says, \"well, the Lord Jesus Christ says he will heal all those who ask in faith, so you must have asked in doubt and fear or else you would have been healed. But it's ok, we're only human, and the Lord told me to tell you that, even though you doubted, he had healed you anyway, and would take this curse from you so that you never have to deal with it again. It's over.\" REALLY!?!?!?!?! So I guess I did all this miserable chemo, surgeryÂ and radiation for nothing? And, even worse, it was my own fault, because I doubted the Lord's power? Oh, and I should be celebrating, because God spoke to HER and told HER that I would never have it again!! Again I say, REALLY????? There are some serious wack jobs out here, and this lady is a complete LUNATIC!!! Anyway, just thought I'd share. I may never go to Wal-Mart again.

I had an experience I had in Wal-Mart over the weekend I hope never to repeat.Â  I apparently have an uncanny propensity to attract every wacko at Wal-Mart anyway, but there must have been a full moon this weekend. I was in Wal-Mart doing my least favorite chore - grocery shopping, and I noticed this lady staring at me. I haven't worn anything on my head in a couple of months, so I had to think for a minute to realize why she was staring. Then she just walks up to me and, very directly, says: So do you have cancer? I was a little taken aback, but decided to be tolerant, so I said yes, I did, but, according to my scans, I am cancer-free now. That just seems to be the easiest way to explain it quickly and simply without details. Then why are you taking treatment, she said. I told her that I was locally advanced and had some lymph node involvement, and that's why my MO wanted to do chemo and radiation, to kill any remaining cancer cells that could not be seen on scans. She said, so is that supposed to take care of it forever, or you just don't know. I said, well, no one really knows, do they. I have done everything I can to prevent a recurrence and that's the best I can do. So did they tell you about all the horrible things chemo and radiation can do to your body, she asked. At this point, I was tired, already irritated that I had to go grocery shopping, andÂ becoming much less tolerant. So, out of the blue, before I could answer, she says, \"well, the Lord Jesus Christ says he will heal all those who ask in faith, so you must have asked in doubt and fear or else you would have been healed. But it's ok, we're only human, and the Lord told me to tell you that, even though you doubted, he had healed you anyway, and would take this curse from you so that you never have to deal with it again. It's over.\" REALLY!?!?!?!?! So I guess I did all this miserable chemo, surgeryÂ and radiation for nothing? And, even worse, it was my own fault, because I doubted the Lord's power? Oh, and I should be celebrating, because God spoke to HER and told HER that I would never have it again!! Again I say, REALLY????? There are some serious wack jobs out here, and this lady is a complete LUNATIC!!! Anyway, just thought I'd share. I may never go to Wal-Mart again.

She started chemo today and was very nervous about it last night. Had lots of questions, and of course, I could only answer the ones about the chemo that I take and how it has affected me.

I was dx'd in February 2012. Some of the details are foggy now (although at the time I felt sure I would never be able to forget any of it). Three days after my dx, I had a double mastectomy with lymph node dissection. My dx at that point was Stage 3A. I underwent dose dense AC/T and 33 radiation treatments. I have now been on Tamoxifen for over 2 1/2 years. After finishing my chemo/RADS, my dr. ordered scans because of a pain in my right ribcage. Upon further testing, it was determined I had a likely met on a right upper rib, as well as two very suspicious looking supraclavicular nodes. At that point, my MO said biopsy would be difficult because of location, and it wouldn't change my course of treatment. So I began Tamoxifen. Four months later, a PET scan showed NED, followed by two repeat NED scans over the next year. I have now been confirmed NED since September 2012. I'm living my life, and I don't wake up every morning thinking about the cancer. I'm well aware that the other shoe may drop at any time, but, until then, I plan to live!

I didn't want more time to think and worry and wonder. In retrospect, I don't know if it was good or bad or even made a difference. I had my routine annual gyn visit on 2/8/12, told my gyn that something just felt different in my left breast (I was fibrocystic in both breasts, and the left just began to feel moreso; turns out the tumor was deep and pushing the fibrocystic tissue outward, making my left breast feel more lumpy). He felt it, said he was 90% sure my fibro was just worse in that breast but ordered a baseline mammo just in case (I'm only 38, with no family history, risk factors, at all, so would not have begun routine mammos until 40). On my way to the office the next morning, the radiology tech called and said I needed to go directly to diagnostic center for US and spot compression mammo; radiologist was almost certain it was cancer, and it was large. I immediately contacted my surgeon, who is a friend of my boss, and on Friday morning, 2/10/12, I had a core biopsy. He called me on Saturday at home with confirmation, and asked what I wanted to do. I chose immediate bilateral mastectomy. He agreed to add me to his schedule for Monday, 2/13/12. So it all happened within five days - DX to bilateral mastectomy -Â  a whirlwind, no time to think. But that's what I wanted. Yet, now, a month later, I have just met with my MO, had all my pre-chemo tests, andÂ a PET scan (which I don't have results from yet). So...more waiting, which is what I hate the most. Did I make the right decision? I don't know. For me, I think I did. Did it really make a difference medically and treatment-wise...probably not.",

Then, when we knew it was cancer, I had a BMX and we were waiting for the pathology report on the lymph nodes, he informed me, again quite confidently, that there was no cancer in my nodes. Again, there was. When they found the lesion on my rib, he again informed me it was not cancer. He tells me the cancer is never coming back because he reads these healing scriptures and prays. I'm glad he prays for me, but I live in the real world. To me, saying that if you have enough faith, you will be healed is an insult to every wonderful, faith-filled person who ever died from cancer. My grandfather, my aunt, my beautiful friend whose life was snuffed out far too early -- faithful Christian people die every day from cancer. It is not pretty, but it is reality.",

I have extensive bone mets, a (mostly resolved) pleural effusion in my right lung, and extensive liver Mets. Of course we are focusing on the liver. I'm taking letrozole and verzenio. Two months so far on the letrozole. A little over a month on the verzenio. The only liver symptoms I had in the beginning were nausea, loss of appetite, amd dark urine. After starting letrozole, the dark urine became normal appearing very quickly. When I began the verzenio the urine became somewhat darker again and I developed mild jaundice. It went away. Then at the end of my first month of verzenio I was out of it for five days because of some mixup with the specialty pharmacy and my insurance. Ive been back on it for five days now. Today I woke up with mild jaundice in my face and moderate in my eyes. Everything else seems to be better. Any thoughts?",

I was dx'd in February, had a BMX, then AC and Taxol, now RADS, starting Tamox next month. My PET scan (after BMX, before chemo) was clear - no mets showing. In June, after starting Taxol, I began to have a tenderness in my rib area, not really pain, not even enough to take a tylenol. Just feels kinda bruised or sore (maybe not a good description). After a few weeks, my MO ordered rib detail x-rays. The x-rays showed a \"possible\" hairline fracture, but also a small sclerosis. I had no idea what that meant, but the MO said, just degenerative, no reason to worry at all. This morning, I saw my RO. He had seen the notes in the chart and asked if it ever resolved. I told no, it was about the same, not really bothersome but if I turn a certain way or poke on it, I can feel the tenderness. So he sent me for another rib detail. He said the spot is still the same, has not grown any, but is not going away, and because I have some tenderness, he wants to do further imaging after I finish RADS. So now I'm freaking out. A friend in my office, who had BC initially in 1998, and has essentially the same stats as me (Stage IIIA, ER/PR+, HER2-, 4 nodes, except hers was Grade 3) said she has a spot thatÂ hasÂ shownÂ up exactly the same way each time sheÂ has beenÂ checked post-chemo in 1998 and is still tender to the touch if she turns a certain way or pokes on it somehow. Her MO told her it was a place where the chemo had collected in sort of a pocket and caused some damage to the bone. He says it is very common and nothing to worry about. That helps me some, but I'm still scared. I love the fact that my RO is cautious - wouldn't want him to be any other way, but I was not worried about this until he was. Any thoughts, anyone?",

I finished RADS a couple of weeks ago. Both my MO and RO have said they believe the sclerotic spot they see on my rib is benign and nothing to worry about. Yet this nagging issue just won't go away. I have had people tell me the tenderness/soreness could be costochondritis; others say rib pain after a mastectomy is common since they sever all those nerves and muscles during the surgery; and this is on the side opposite my surgery. The spot did not show up on my PET scan in March, and since then, I have had dose dense AC plus Taxol, and rads. The issue started while I was taking Taxol. The spot has shown on two rib detail xrays - two and a half months apart. It shows as a small sclerotic spot; it did not grow or change in any way in the two and a half months between the xrays. I feel as anxious as a I did when I was waiting for the initial PET scan. Do the scans ever get less scary? Any words of wisdom?",
