I tried it last night when I went out with a friend, and I wore my cute little pixie-cut wig, and no one knew that it was a wig or that I had fleshed out my eyebrows. My eyelashes are definitely halfway gone but that doesn't seem to be so bad. I'm actually going to call my guy tomorrow and see if we can't work things out. After a couple of days of thinking about it, I realize what I wanted to convey to him and that I think we can make it work. Mainly, he has some issues about commitment and is very hesitant to be considered anything other than the guy I'm dating (boyfriend is a big scary word to him, which I didn't realize) yet he has been there for me every step of the way. My own insecurities freaked me out recently and caused the whole confrontation on Thursday. I'm glad we talked and I'm optimistic that we can work through this and come out well on the other side. It is hard to think about going through this without him because despite his hesitation to be considered anything more than casual, he has been my rock and my comfort. So anyway... I was thinking, too, about everything we've all gone through together, we July sisters, and I'm so glad you've all be here, going through this with me. It's good to know I'm not alone, whether it's side effects or relationship issues. I wish us all strength and ease as we continue our journeys together.",

I was blown away by how well they portray it. Monica Potter does such a great job with portraying the complexity of emotions. Sure, it's still a bit simplified but of course they can't give you everything. But it's so well written and done with such dignity and compassion. I had watched Guiliana and Bill, the reality show, when she was diagnosed and was so upset with how they sort of glossed over her double mastectomy after promoting for weeks that the show was going to get into her diagnosis and everything. I had just been diagnosed when these shows aired and I was looking for some inspiration. All I thought was, I want her cancer. It was over in a couple of shows. And her surgery was treated like she had a corn removed. So insulting, I thought, and irresponsible because it made cancer seem so unimportant. Ironic that a fictional dramedy would get it so right and a \"reality\" show would get it so wrong.",

A very young (25?) drunken hipster seemed very interested in me, which amused me and gave me a moment of feeling like a girl again, after all of the surgery and treatments and ports and bruises and scars. It was kind of nice to have someone notice me. He kept commenting on my smile, to which I replied, \"I've cut off all my hair, makes my smile easier to notice.\". Anyway, gave me a good laugh and a teeny bit of an ego boost, which I sorely needed. And my friend, as I broke into a coughing fit, looked at, deadpan, and said, \"What's the matter? You sick?\" Then she smiled. Almost felt normal for a moment... :)",

He's a director and a cinematographer so he \"directed\" my blog for the head shaving. My dear friend, Tracy, also came over since we're going to Disneyland tomorrow so she's staying over tonight. The tears I shed tonight were tears of laughter and gratitude. Mark shaved my head first into an off-center Mohawk and then down to one tiny lock sticking out at the front of my head. We laughed until we cried. They made it an evening full of love and laughter and just safety that I can almost handle the fact that I'm pretty much bald. And he made me feel loved and beautiful every single step of the way. And he even cleaned up all the hair afterward. So today started out very sadly and depressing and awful but I'm going to bed tonight knowing that I'm loved and feeling that I can get through this, without having well-intentioned people standing around telling me I'll get through this. I am so truly grateful to have these people in my life. The vlog will be up soon and I'll post a link to it.",

My friend told me how proud she was of me that I went out without a hat and just didn't seem to care. Then I went to a film festival with my amazing guy on Saturday. Bought a cute little fedora as I wasn't sure how I'd feel about going bald at an event like this or how he would feel. I lasted about an hour before I took the hat off because my head was itchy and the hat got very hot. Everyone raved about how great I looked with my shaved head. It was so gratifying. I'm kind of digging the bald thing now and only wearing hats to protect my head - it's over 100 degrees out here in LA and too much sun. And my boyfriend just can't seem to stop running his hands over my head. He thinks it's very sexy. And when I told him I need to really shave it down to bald for a henna tattoo photo shoot this weekend, he immediately offered to do it for me. Like I said, I think he's finding this whole part weirdly sexy. I'll take it because I'm not feeling so sexy right now. So I say embrace the bald, and say screw you to anyone who doesn't get it.",

Yet he was still golfing three times a week. The doctors gave up trying to give him a prognosis eventually because he just defied all their odds. About six years ago, he fell and broke his collar bone and disloacted his shoulder. They couldn't repair the damage because of his heart problems. He had to give up golf but he kept going. Every day, he'd wake up and just be grateful to still be walking on the earth. He had been giving six months to live six times over ten years. He never fought to live loudly, he just lived. He never complained, he just lived. That's the last gift he gave me - just live. That's how I'm tackling this disease - just live.

It's actually very cute - short and sassy, just the way I like my hair. It's kind of sandy blonde, which is weird cuz I've been coloring my hai black for the past few years.

We had a really good, healthy talk about what we each want and he assured me that he never really saw me as \"sick\" and that he didn't stay with me just because I was sick. But we both want different things and I cannot deal with the casual nature of our relationship anymore. So I just walked away from something that has been so good and so wonderful because it was starting to hurt and I needed to go before it hurt more. I'm heartbroken more so because he cannot see what a wonderful man he is. His ex has him convinced that he's a selfish, ungiving narcissist who's just a bad person and I cannot convince him otherwise. He kept telling me how bad of a person he is and how terrible of a boyfriend he \"would be\". So he's cannot let himself be in a real relationship because I think he doesn't think he's worthy of it. That kills me more than anything. So I will go on and go through without him. It'll be hard because I'm so crazy about him. But right now, I have to take care of and protect me. I wish him nothing but love and I hope I can let him back in as a friend at some point. But not right now.",

Her earlier tests a few months ago showed \"low abnormal cells\" and a current test showed \"high abnormal cells\". They are considered pre-cancerous and not even gradeable at this point. But as a precaution, they are recommending a hysterectomy, which she is going to do because the cells are obviously growing. She is relieved and planning the surgery for February so she can clear her work schedule and get through the holidays, which her doctor said was fine. So she won't have to go through any other treatment other than the surgery, which we're both grateful for. As for me, today is my last day for chemo. Went yesterday for my infusion and today is hydration and stuff like that. But I am done! So grateful for all the incredible support I've had along the way. Have about a month off then rads. Waiting to hear from a radiation oncologist closer to me to set up the consult and get everything going so not exactly sure when it'll all happen. But so glad to be through this step.

The facilitator said it can be like PTSD. After chemo - or any other milestone with treatment - you can feel all the things you're been suppressing to just get through. You can suddenly feel all the loss, all the pain, all the mourning you may not have allowed yourself to feel. And it can happen right after chemo or months or years later. I just finished chemo just over a week ago and it crashed in on me. And I'm sure that won't be the end of it. We have been through a war. And though the people around us love us, they can't understand what we've been through. I agree with SusanHG123. Find support, find a therapist. Usually, the hospital you have your treatment through have some kind of support group or therapist. I never thought I would do a support group but I have found it invaluable. For anyone out here in Los Angeles, I cannot recommend WeSPARK in Sherman Oaks enough. They also do the Look Good Feel Good events and have tons of free offerings for cancer patients, including yoga, energy work, support groups, etc.",

After an hour, I went to ask about what was going on since I was supposed to get my port installed first. They didn't realize that so they rushed to send me to the other building to do that. Took forever. Finally, they got it installed - 3 hours later. My boyfriend was supposed to leave around 2:30 so he was stuck as I left all my stuff with him. Luckily, he's great and tho he was a bit pissed, he didn't take it out on me and left with a kiss and a smile. Finally got into the chemo room. That's when the fun really started. My port apparently is not put in correctly. For about two hours, they tried to get it work and it would for a bit and then stopped. So finally they just stuck in into a vein and it worked fine. I have to call in the AM and see if they can fix the port tomorrow. My friend, Patty, came around 4 and entertained me while I was going through the craziness. So I was supposed to be done around 6:00. Instead, it was 10 PM by the time I got out. Other than the port weirdness, everyone was lovely and really did their best to keep me calm and try to get as much help as possible to fix the port. They even fed me, which was great. So I'm tired but not feeling any SE's yet. Trying to eat something before I go to bed since I'm starving. Guess that's a good sign.

But I just laughed and explained I'm taking medication to make me healthy but it's gonna make me look funny for a while and she was cool. I'm finding just being honest about my hair and not hiding it helps make people more comfortable. I joke about it Andy laugh about it and it puts them at ease. They're gonna say dumb things because they don't know. If you don't take offense, it makes things easier. All of us are strong, we just show it in different ways.",

I want to write a blog about how there seems to be some sort of shame attached to being bald because of this disease and how that seems to be changing the more we're willing to be honest and open about where we are.

My fault because I forgot to take the glutamine the last round. It has no taste but it's gritty and makes me want to vomit when I drink it. But I guess I need to suck it up and do it so I don't lose any more feeling. Otherwise, doing okay. SE's are still tolerable. But like all of you, dreading chemo tomorrow.

Though I did get a cute wig that I wear only occasionally, when I don't feel like looking like a cancer patient. I wore it out last night and confused some friends I haven't seen in a while because I'm usually dark haired and the wig is kind of dirty blonde. But it works! And my DBF think it's sexy. So I only wear it once in a while so I find it tolerable. But I do get sick of the bald head and hats and scarves. Can't wait till I get my hair back, to be honest. My eyebrows are just now really showing wear and tear and I've lost about half my eyelashes. And the hair in my nether regions is completely gone, which is kind of strange.

I've had very little pain at all. Been doing mostly ice packs and Tylenol. Haven't used a painkiller at all.

Because of what I've gone thrugh before this diagnosis - highly dysfunctional family, abusive marriage - I've learned that the only way to vest yourself of the emotion is to allow it to come out.

So far, it's only been regular clinicians who have told me absolutely nothing, other than I have cancer. Hopefully, on the 27th, this doctor will give me information and tell me what's going on. So frustrating. The lovely man I'm dating is going with me so he can be there emotionally and also because he's very pragmatic and I think will be an asset with helping me sort through information. So this is my frustration. I have no information. They've told me it's early but I don't know what that means.

I'm trying to figure out who has my pathology report because I went to a fre clinic first when I found the lump and they sent me to an imaging center for the mammography. I emailed the clinic over the weekend to see how to find my pathology report so hopefully I'll get that figured out today. I'll maybe call the imaging center today as well and see if they have the pathology reports. I do have the mammography and ultrasound reports. I do have an enlarge lymph node in my left armpit - that's what started this whole adventure, measuring 2.5 x 1.8 x 2.1 cm. The mass that was biopsied in my left breast measures 1.9 x 1.4 x 1.8 cm, which means nothing to me right now. Yes, I'm so very grateful that I have a great guy who's willing to go through this with me, even though our relationship has not been \"serious\". And I have a terrific group of friends who are willing to drive me (can't afford to run my car right now), feed me and entertain me. I'll add asking about an MRI to the list of things I want to ask the doctor about. I have been blogging about my diagnosis, as I'm sure many of you probably do. You can check it out at diaryofamidlifecrisis.blogspot.com. Started seven years ago as a blog about my life after leaving a 16 year, emotionally abusive marriage.
