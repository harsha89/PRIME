I came on tonight because I finished TC chemo a week ago today and today got a call to schedule a follow up MRI for yes you guessed it a cystic like thing on my liver they found before chemo. I am nervous about it but I can't believe they would even consider starting us on chemo treatments if they had any suspicion that it was a cancer. Interested in knowing if others had same experience too. Message me and tell me how you are doing. You gave me some good advice when all this started. My Best Wishes Sharon ",
