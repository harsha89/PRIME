Today december 8, 2016 and still no treatment has started, no matter how I ask and beg, two Oncologists just look up at the ceiling, just two days ago I was told if I have not heard anything in a month I should call their office....... This is not lost luggage and even if it would get faster attention. I know my mouth was whispering wtf.

But.....",
