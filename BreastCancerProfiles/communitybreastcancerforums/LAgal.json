Nothing worked to stop the progression. Finally I found Dr. Medzger at University of Pittsburgh. He prescribed a mixture of methotrexate and steroids for 6 months. It worked. The combination of the drugs stopped the progression. Over the years I did start seeing what I thought was morphea in other areas but the new areas were diagnosed as LSA. LSA, like Morphea is an auto-immune disorder. Now, 13 years later, the morphea has become active again. I will be starting the methotrexate again next week. The good news is that I am still cancer free . Good luck to you",
