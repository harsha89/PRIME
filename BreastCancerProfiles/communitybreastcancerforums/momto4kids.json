When i got out the shower this morning i was looking at my left breast and where im  feeling the lump im pretty sure my breast is larger in that area just looking at it. When i look at it in the mirror it just looks different and not right.  Maybe im just going cray at this point and looking for things... anyway's  i hope i might have some answers in a hour.",

After the ultrasound tech was done the tech had a Dr come in and look at the Pictures, they were thinking they could see something. After looking more they Believe its my implants  what is making the lump. I have no idea why my implant can make that size off a lump, i have had them i think around 8 or 9 years. Im going to make a apt to see the Dr who put them in. I just hope the Tech and the Dr yesterday are Right and that they are not missing anyting",

My lump or mass is a little smaller than a golf ball and at the moment im really freaking out with worry. I have 4 children, my son is 19 and just left  home as he is in  the Military and i have no idea how he would deal with this.  My son and i are very close, and i think this would just devasate him esp with him now being so far away. I dont think im so scared  off what the results are going to be but im more upset at thinking how my husband and kids are going to be if i do have Cancer and how they are going to be feeling inside. I just hate to see them hurting and sad... Any way i wish you both well and will keep my fingers X for your wife and ((hug's))) to you.",

A couple months ago I started to get some pain in my left breast, very painful pains that really did worry me. But being such a busy mom I told myself that I will see if it gets better.  Well the good thing is that yes the pain did get better, how ever yesterday in the shower I noticed that when I push down in the left breast I can fill a lump a hard lump. it\u2019s a little smaller than  a golf  ball, it can move but just a little. Its more like it slides round if that makes sense ( but very very moment). Now the problem is I had breast implants several years ago, I have had 2 sets. My first Dr did such a horrible job that the 2nd Dr had to do reconstructive surgery. I have never noticed or felt this lump before. I even had my husband check it out yesterday to see if he had noticed it before and he had not. We are in the process off changing family Dr\u2019s too which is horrible timing. We have a PPO so I know I can get a mammogram done without a referral but can some one give me some advice please as well as what kind off Dr I should be looking for. I\u2019m 34 with 4 children Log in to post a reply",
