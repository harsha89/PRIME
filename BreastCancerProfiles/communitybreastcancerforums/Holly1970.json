I have 4 children and have had a hysterectomy to help keep my iron levels up. What I would like to know...if there is anyone who has taken Tamoxifen as prevention before cancer is diagnosed?   How long they took it?  Do you loose your hair?     What other options do I have?  Thanks for any information anyone can share.  Holly Log in to post a reply",
