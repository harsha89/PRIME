So, tired of it all... Is it possible to already be feeling tingles and fatigue? I've had very few side effects from the chemo (compared to most). But still get chest heaviness apparently from the projeta (which I finished in April) and leg achiness. Don't understand why at this point I'm feeling more emotional than everything else...Up to this point everything went great.. I'm told I've handling everything well above average. (tried to put most of my treatment in the personal info, not sure if I got it all right.. Had project, herceptin, toxetere carboplatin. Still getting projeta every 3 weeks) ",

I've tried to keep it all in perspective trusting the professionals that keep telling me all will be well. Drs and Nurses have all said I've done exceptionally well through out the process. This week, though, I've been cranky and tired. My husband keeps telling me I'm entitled and to cut myself a break.. Just trying to figure if I'm overthinking what I feel physically or if it really is already effecting me. I miss being able to work out as I had started a program in Jan 2016. Lost 40lbs before I felt my lump in Nov. Was able to get to the gym a bit even during chemo, but since the end of chemo and my surgery, and now radiation, I'm told to not overdue it. sigh. frustrating!",
