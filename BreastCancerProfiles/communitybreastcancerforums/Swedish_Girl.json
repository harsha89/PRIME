    "Content": "Swedish_Girl wrote: My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer about 3-4 years ago. Her cancer was ER+, a larger tumour and positive nodes. She was around 60 years old at the time. I was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer this year, 33 years old. 2.1 cm, negative nodes. We received basically the same course of treatment and she is doing well so far. I'm doing radiation after chemo and a lumpectomy. I did a BRCA test which came back negative and was reassured by that result. But the last week my mom had a doctors appointment, and her oncologist told her that my cancer was most certainly something hereditary, although my own oncologist says its unlikely. What should I believe? I was happy with the negative BRCA test result, since a positive one most certainly would have made me go for a bilateral mastectomy and possibly also to remove the ovaries. My doctor also made sure we did the testing before the radiation just to make sure, since a mastectomy would mean that I could skip radiation. I do trust my own oncologist a lot, and I have never met my mother's, and that doctor does not know much about my cancer. But still... I have a husband and two children, if my risk to get cancer again is high, I would take precautions without a doubt. But my oncologist doesn't seem to think its necessary. I don't know what to believe. For now I had a lumpectomy with clear margins, negative SNB, chemo with EC*3 and Docetaxel*3 and now rads, 16 whole breast and 8 boost at the tumour site. My mothers cancer was ER+ and mine was all negative, is it usually that way when its hereditary?
