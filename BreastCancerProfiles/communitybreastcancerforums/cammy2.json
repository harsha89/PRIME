HAving a bilat mx in 5 days - NOv 20th.  I STILL hav enot cried - a few times tears have welled in my eyes but none have even rolled down my cheeks.  I am worried I may have a melt down or a \"Come Apart\" as another dear BC lady called it  at a very inopportune time and I am also worried I may not have it at all.  I think that part of my brain took over that needs to handle things.  Also feel protective of my family and friends - I don't want to make them sad and everyone seemed worried. It is almost like I feel guilty.  Two of my friends told me they haven't been sleeping because they are sad and worried about me and I feel awful for causing them distress. Kind of weird. I think we will have our time of sorrow - we are doing what we need to do, in our own way, in our own time.  Thinking of you - Cammy",
