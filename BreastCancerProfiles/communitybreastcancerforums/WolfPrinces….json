      "Content": "Feb 20, 2011 05:47AM - edited Feb 22, 2011 03:18AM by WolfPrincess Hello, ladies! I cannot sleep either and it is 6.15 am here in Serbia... I paid a visit to the ultrasound specialist's three days ago and he diagnosed me with:  A benign tumour in my left breast, located at 14:00 (2 o'clock), its size 16.5 mm x 9.6 mm x 13.8 mm. It is situated 3.6 mm under my skin. It has been classified as BI-RADS 3 or BI-RADS 4a. He recommended going to the oncologist's for running further tests and actual treatment (possibly surgery). I haven't told anybody the alarming news yet; if I had, my mother would just freak out and I have got enough problems keeping myself calm and reasonable without having to reassure her as well. Tomorrow I am going to see a friend of mine who is a maxillofacial surgeon and ask him to get me to the best oncologist in Belgrade. I want that tumour removed as soon as possible, I do not want it co-habiting within me, that sleeping ogre, a constant threat to my general health and peace of mind. I keep praying to the Almighty and I find consolation in belief that I've been given a fair warning and in time to prevent a malignant growth. I am 39, single, childless and have no family history of this terrible illness, I neither smoke nor drink alcohol, but I must confess that I put on 30 kg in the last 7 years and this threat of breast cancer has made me reconsider my life style and life priorities. I shall definitely lose those damnable extra kilos because I suspect that they might be one of the reasons for developing the tumour in my otherwise healthy body... Furthermore, I want to offer my support to all you ladies who share my anxiety over future test results; I think that the waiting is the most gruesome aspect at this stage of potentially lethal illness. God bless you all and give you the courage to survive this temptation. ",

      "Content": "Feb 21, 2011 12:03AM - edited Feb 22, 2011 03:10AM by WolfPrincess I am back. It is almost 1am, and I can get no sleep again. It seems I cannot stop googling BI-RADS grading system or anything referring to breast tumours. I am afraid I am developing an obsession. The waiting is killing me... and if I have to wait for weeks to be examined by an expert oncologist I shall probably go mad and do something irrational. I have never been a patient person, and now when I am A PATIENT I am even less inclined to develop the praise-worthy trait! What am I to do? Reading? I cannot concentrate on any topic. Writing? I am doing it and it doesn't help in the least. Sleeping? Impossible. And I shall not take any pills, I abhor all drugs and I hate the mere thought of getting addicted to the infernal stuff. I am lonely. I haven't confided in my family and friends and I am about to burst with this pent-up uncertainty and deeply ingrained fear. Breast cancer, for Christ's sake! The ultimate nightmare of all women. How to cope with the stalking monster? It is out there seeking to maim and take away the beauty of being a woman in full sense of the word. I loathe it!!! I am shuddering. I have no mouth and I must scream. Silence. I must bear this torment in total silence. I have never felt so isolated in my life. As if I were a lepar in the Middle Ages. Ugh! I stop here and now, because this sounds particularly like self-pity, the feeling most despised by my she-wolf's nature. ",

      "Content": "Feb 20, 2011 11:25AM - edited Feb 22, 2011 03:12AM by WolfPrincess Marlegal, hun, thanks for your kind words and much needed support. I am well aware that no woman deserves to cope with such a terrible, debilitating and humiliating illness. Our breasts are the symbol of our femininity and any damage to them is a hard blow dealt to female self-confidence. We may pretend that it isn't so, but the horrid truth of it remains nonetheless. Fortunately, plastic and reconstructive surgery is being improved constantly nowadays and it helps post surgical recovery immensely. I am endlessly grateful for living in the 21st century, because my grandmothers wouldn't have had this chance if they had been diagnosed with breast cancer or tumour. Therefore, like you (all) do, I must remain positive in my attitude and not wallow in self-pity. I must count my blessings and face this illness as a challenge not beyond my abilities and mental strength. Whatever has caused the tumour, I shall do my best to defeat it and not only that: I shall not allow the tumour to scar my personality or make me less a woman or a decent human being. If the good Lord helps me survive this ordeal, I shall strive to repay Him by being a better person than I used to be. I am going to start by being nicer to my body - I'll give it healthier food and more exercise. And last but not the least, I am going to visit this site regularly and share positive thoughts and attitudes with whomever in need of them. I am so happy that this community exists, because sharing with you helps lessen the burden of uncertainty, waiting and onslaughts of sneaky depression. I am looking forward to reading your posts, ladies. God bless you and keep you courageous.",

      "Content": "Feb 22, 2011 03:03AM - edited Feb 22, 2011 03:07AM by WolfPrincess Ladies, you ARE such darlings! Whatever would I do without you here to give me support, comfort and peace of mind? I cannot find words to express my gratitude and appreciation. God bless you all! Danie22 & Carpediem1965, I wish there were \"melatonin\" in Serbia. I shall look for it at some of the larger pharmacies in Belgrade, thanks for the tip.   Upon my word, I am not looking forward to using any external \"help\" for sleep, but if it keeps evading me I shall be coerced to. Anyway, your concern is touching and heart-warming and I am sending you loads of kisses and hugs and positive energy! Letlet, (alas!) I haven't got any biopsy scheduled yet, but yesterday I contacted the private clinic where the esteemed Prof. Dr Radan Džodić worked, so I am on tenterhooks to have a return call from them. I was told that Dr Džodić had been away on holiday and that patients' waiting list was rather long. I keep praying that I reach him soon. The sooner the better. He would do my biopsy and afterwards the surgery itself... Anyway, I still stubbornly refuse to tell my family about the tumour knowing what an uproar they would make over the potentially bad news. I think I may tell them after I have been informed about the biopsy results. The ultrasound suggests the possibility that my tumour is almost certainly a fibroadenoma, so I'll keep my wits around me and calm down a bit. I find myself pretty drained - physically and emotionally as well. It has been five days since my life changed dramatically. I am still smarting from the slap Fate dealt me so harshly and unexpectedly...  As for friends, I needn't tell them anything, you ladies are the only friends who matter presently and your words and compassion do not ring hollowly to me. Knowing my savage nature, I would probably get irritated with my real-life friends' reactions and say something I ought not to. What they do not know cannot hurt them. Ignorance is a bliss I am endowing them with.  By the way, I've read a lot of about breast cancer and its staging, grading and surgical treatments. The data I found at www.MayoClinic.com was very enlightening. \"Know Your Enemy\"! (Rage Against The Machine) - you must know it in order to defeat it. And I am getting ready for a helluva campaign. Aww, if only I could see the oncologist by the end of this week!!! I must know what is there in store for me. I want the truth, the facts, the awareness. I am very angry for not being aware earlier of this sneaky, skulking, backstabbing, traitorous monstrosity of an illness. I loathe it. Therefore I am hereby officially declaring war. There can be only one. I shall have myself cleansed of this abomination, foul intruder, loathsome alien. If it must be done by a scalpel - so be it. I want the surgery done and the abominable ogre gone. I want it more than anything. And, as Paulo Coelho noticed wisely in his \"Alchemist\": \"If you want something badly enough, if you desire it fiercely enough, all the universe conspires to make it come true.\" Zero conditional, pure fact... My ladies, I wish your greatest desire granted. I wish you health and love - the incomparable joy of these two ultimately divine gifts. May God grant us all health and love, because life is hardly worth living deprived of the pair. P.S I've just glanced at the clock - it is 4am in Belgrade! I am off to bed to try to lure that unfaithful and maddeningly evasive Hypnos into my lair! ",
