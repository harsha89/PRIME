I had a lumpectomy, radiation and 5 years of Tamoxifen after an early stage IDC dx in 2010. I was tested for BRCA when I was first dx'd and it was negative. I have a family history of a second degree relative with pre-menopausal bc (paternal aunt), my father had a melanoma and lots of colon polyps although none that turned into cancer, and a paternal grandmother with colon cancer (although at a very advanced age). I was having a lot of little issues and problems so my wonderful oncologist at the NYU Cancer Center had me do this assay. At first my insurance wouldn't cover it but somehow she worked it through. I think it was a situation where it took like 6 months for them to let me know if it would be approved, it wasn't,  and then they felt so badly, they ran the test for free. In any case, it all came back negative, with the exception of the check2 gene which they deemed \"inconclusive: variant of unknown origin.\"  Nobody seems to be worried about this, except me.....Not sure where to take this from here......Except probably another five years of Tamoxifen. Joy....",

I immediately noticed a size difference (that was always the smaller Breast anyway) but after the radiation it kind of lifted it too. Now, several yesrs later im feeling that it's much smaller and not only is it shrinking, my other Breast is growling and changing constantly. I've had three consultations with many different options. What I eventuslly figured out is that an irradiated Breast becomes frozen in time where your other Breast moved and changes with hormones, wright gain, loss etc. But the radiated one always stays the same. I've considered scar release abd an implant with lipo and a fat graft to smooth it out, a lift and just a fat graft, and a lift without a fat graft which would take me from a small D (originally) to a B cup then the other Breast needs to be reduced and lifted to match. It's been a long haul a and I think I'm going to opt fot the lift on one and the reduction and lift oft on on the other. I've never had small breasts before it might be fun",
