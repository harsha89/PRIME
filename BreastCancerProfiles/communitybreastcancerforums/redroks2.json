For future reference though, often times if they know you have to pay out of pocket, you will receive a reduced rate. Also, you can ask them for a payment plan. By law, there can not be interest charged on medical procedures so you wouldn't be paying anything extra if you chose a payment plan. Your deductible really isn't too terribly high but the I know, the 80/20 can kill ya. We switched to an HMO about 10 years ago and although there's pluses and minuses to everything, I know without a doubt that we would be living in a box under a bridge if we had a PPO. Around here, we get the mammo and u/s results right there in the room so there is no waiting to find out what they saw. Of course I always pick up my report and my CD copy on the way out! An inverted nipple IS something that warrants concern and yes, more than the lump believe it or not. On the up side, you learn a lot while you're waiting! I've done so much freakin' research that I have dreams about evil mammogram machines with sharp teeth and red eyes that gobble up boobies! :-o",

I'm not saying the biopsies are wrong, but I have very dense breast tissue so mammo doesn't show much and the ultrasound tech always just seems to check the spots we already know about. I found the first mass almost 4 years ago and my ObGyn sent me for an ultrasound. The tech looked at it for about 5 seconds, said  she didn't see anything, and then sent me on my way. I now have a 4th mass that has shown up and the tech did the SAME thing again last week. Um, it's the size of a grape at minimum so I'm pretty sure it's not a figment of my imagination! I My point is that you have to do what is best for YOUR breasts. These puppies are not created equal so what may work for me, may not work for you. Just be aware of your options and understand the difference in their diagnostic usage. I am definitely one of those people who stays calmer with information so yes, I have done mass quantities of research BUT, you have to take the good with the bad and as a generalization only. I know what the best and worst case scenario, and all the possibilities in between, but I am my first and best advocate and I can't do that job effectively without fully understanding it all myself. All my doctors have been great but how would I know if they weren't if I didn't seek out additional information? My oldest son was born with a congenital defect and his first surgeon was fabulous, we loved her...and she screwed up huge. She failed to give us extremely pertinent information that could have cost my son his life. Ever since then, I will ALWAYS research and I will ALWAYS be sure I understand all the possibilities and that means researching the benign options as well as the not-so-benign one's. And yes, waiting SUCKS!!! Keeping busy is the best way to deal with it though so I'm thankful spring sports have started up again because it keeps me runnin'...while I'm waitin'!",

A dominant mass will persist throughout a menstrual cycle (certainly not the case for you ). Smooth, welldemarcated dominant masses that are mobile are often benign.  A \"nodule\" is simply a term used by the radiologist to describe anomalies. Nodule/mass/lump/growth...it's semantics.  #fingerscrossedforyou",

I spent a week deciding if I should call the doctor, a week waiting for the appointment, a week of testing, and then another week of waiting for results...and I too know nothing other than, \"You have a mass of unknown etiology\". Awesome (insert eye roll here). Since the intense squish of the mammogram resulted in an abscess (barf!) everything that needs to be done has been pushed back FOUR LONG AGONIZING WEEKS to allow for antibiotics and tissue recovery. Blah, blah, blah *pouting* For the most part I am doing okay but of course, I have my moments that catch me off guard and I have to take a deep breath down to my toes. Other times we make totally tasteless jokes  I keep telling my husband, it's not a tumor. My brain got so large a piece fell off and landed in my ta-ta and now, not only does it have a \"mind of it's own\" but it KNOWS things, like when you're lying about how much you really paid for that new Coleman Cooler. I also pulled the tumor card to get the last cupcake. I'm not proud of it but, I really wanted the cupcake  My kids knew I had a small procedure when the abscess (barf!) was drained but, my ten year old is certainly more perceptive. He hasn't asked me anything specific but, I can tell he knows something is up. His birthday is just seven days away so, despite my lack of patience, I'm glad any potential bad news will come after. I've only told a couple of family members and a few bestest good friends. Your family are there to support you and your friends are there to keep you sane...and bring liquor when required.  I have 16 more days to wait for round two of testing...meanwhile, I am drawing up eviction papers for Lumpy Lumperson! ",

Mine do not, though they are quite familiar with Alzheimer's. During a coversation about Grandma's memory a few weeks back, I did ask my oldest if he knew what cancer was and he said no. You'd think I would have been relieved but to my shock, I had quite the opposite reaction. Once I processed it for a moment I realized that explaining cancer would be more difficult for me than having to tell him I had it (if I did). He knows there are many kinds and that some are bad and some are not so bad but, nothing beyond that. I can handle just about anything with a calm face but when it comes to the kids...I'm generally a snotty, slobbering mess.  How soon is surgery? I don't know how accurate I am but from all my experiences, back surgery is by far one of the hardest recoveries so this should be gravy in comparison!  Besides, a night with a medical staff is always better than a night without one!",

When I found a suspicous lump a few years ago (age 33) my ObG didn't hesitate to send me for my first Mammogram. Thank GOD she did because that became my baseline for what I'm dealing with now and that baseline has proven to be an extremely relevant reference. I think ALL women should have a baseline in their 20's and again in their 30's.  On my first visit, my surgeon asked me about family history. Well, BOTH sides are LOADED with cancer of varying forms. He asked specifically about breast cancer and I told him my Paternal Grandmother died in her 30's of breast cancer with spinal mets. He proceeded to tell me that genetically speaking, it really only \"counted\" if it is a first generation connection like a mother or a sister. THIS IS WHERE I CALL FOUL. I got a little snippy with him when I explained, my PATERNAL Grandma had 4 boys, 3 of whom have had cancer of a major organ (father included), I am an only child AND the only grandchild...sooooo, what were you saying about \"first generation\"?? When it comes to disease and the human body there should never be any kind of cookie cutter approach. Guidelines, reccomendations, sure. But no two people have the same experience, the same symptoms, or the same responses to treatment. Doctor's need to stop being afraid to think outside the box. And let's be realistic here...Cancer is cancer is cancer and when they find a cure for one, I am quite sure the rest will follow so, for me, I don't want to \"Race for a Cure\" because it seems...impractical. What we need right now is to \"race\" for early screening, mandatory baselines, screening facilities in rural areas, better facilities for low-income women, insurance coverage for genetic screening for high risk women...but, I'm just spitballin'",
