I am now nearly 2 months out of surgery, still have an infection in incision.  Thought rads would be starting in July, and now it looks like September or October.  This is making me VERY nervous.   I visit a public health nurse every day to get the opening packed.  Have to get MORE anti-biotics tomorrow.  (BTW - this is one disadvantage to having chemo before surgery - your body doesn't fight off infections yet).  Still no straight answer on why they didn't give me anti-biotics post surgery to prevent this.   I'm supposed to leave  for my cottage next Saturday, hopefully for 2 wks., but because of this, may have to either delay or cancel my plans.   GEEZ!!!! ",

At least he forced me to rethink my position.  My surgery date is June 1 - he told me to take a little more time, revisit my options.  I know he is not trying to persuade me either way, but at least he took the time to chat with me again. ",
