I was stage 4 from the beginning with several bone mets. I am the mother of 2 children, a daughter, 19 and a son, 10. Their father was killed in an automobile accident on May 18, 2010. Ironically, my first chemo treatment was May 18, 2011. Life is funny sometimes. Right now I am on tamoxifen and zometa. The former has stabilized my cancer and the later has strengthened my bone lesions. But I have a liver biopsy scheduled for next week due to a severe fatty liver that developed in 9 months as a SE of the tamoxifen. Although my oncologist says that tamoxifen doesn't cause fatty liver. I am an artist, a painter and I developed a passion for bead weaving during my radiation treatments. Lately I spend all of my free time bead weaving. At the moment I make a living as a substitute teacher for high school and a home instructor and tutor. I really love teaching and planned to finish my last 15 credits to get certified as an intervention teacher for high school, however, my cancer diagnoses paired with the layoff of 65 teachers into school district nixed that idea. I really need to live for 11 more years and get my children through college. After that I'll take what comes.",

Tamoxifen causes fatty liver which can lead to NASH. \"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH is a common, often \u201csilent\u201d liver disease. It resembles alcoholic liver disease, but occurs in people who drink little or no alcohol. The major feature in NASH is fat in the liver, along with inflammation and damage. Most people with NASH feel well and are not aware that they have a liver problem. Nevertheless, NASH can be severe and can lead to cirrhosis, in which the liver is permanently damaged and scarred and no longer able to work properly. NASH affects 2 to 5 percent of Americans. An additional 10 to 20 percent of Americans have fat in their liver, but no inflammation or liver damage, a condition called \u201cfatty liver.\u201d Although having fat in the liver is not normal, by itself it probably causes little harm or permanent damage. If fat is suspected based on blood test results or scans of the liver, this problem is called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). If a liver biopsy is performed in this case, it will show that some people have NASH while others have simple fatty liver.\"",

I have fatty liver that developed in 9 months from healthy to severe fatty liver from tamoxifen. I asked my onc about it at every scan and he shrugged and told me it was my diet. I have a great diet high in vegetables and I use olive and grape seed oil exclusively. Finally I googled and found that it was a side effect of tamoxifen. When I asked my onc, he said really? I don't do livers, you need a specialist. I waited 4 months for the referral and finally went to my GP to get a referral to a liver specialist. The biopsy showed a fatty liver but low risk of NASH. My onc saw me before the counts came back on the ALT and AST. So I asked the nurse and she shrugged and said if I wanted she would mention it to my onc. I haven't heard a word from them. So I called my liver dr. He said to wait 4 weeks and do another liver panel. That was before the fever. I went to my GP and we ruled out some basic things like UTI and hepatitis. The diffuse liver mets are what I'm afraid of. That little voice in my head keeps saying that's what is wrong. We did another CBC showed rising WBC. At least that part of my body is working.",

They believe that the rising liver enzymes were caused by niacin, which I was taking to combat a severe fatty liver from tamoxifen. I also had a zometa treatment that Monday and I think that threw my body over the cliff. Docs also think there was a possibility of a virus but i think that's unlikely because it is usually the flu that causes this and I had no respiratory symptoms. On the upside my onc is finally taking me off tamoxifen and putting me on a post menopausal drug and he is finally listening to me.
