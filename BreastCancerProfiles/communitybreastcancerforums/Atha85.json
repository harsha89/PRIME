She needs me right now. Its so frustrating when \"what if\" crosses your mind. Hope you are feeling better now. How is your radiation going? Any side effects with the skin? I have become extremely sensitive post chemo and surgery. So I am little nervous.   Moodyblue - all the best for your surgery. Hope you recover soon. '+ve' is just my way or writing positive. Sorry if that confused you. ",

There was no palpable tumor or anything on the MRI. However, post surgery i found that there was 1.2 cm tumor still left inside plus 4/6 nodes positive I am just hoping the hormonal theraphy works for me. My docs have prescribed Zoladex and AI for a decade. I read in some of the posts and I'm curious to know, what are surgical margins?? Also, how do I get my signature like most of you have about diagnosis and treatments. I have already updated my profile. Thanks",

When i had surgery, it came out to be 1+cm tumor left and 4/6 lymph nodes positive. Today i learnt from MO that chemo might not be working really well since I already had 10 cycles and still came out with so much cancer left. Also, the hormone therapy recommended is for 10 years. Which means i cannot get pregnant till menopause, which i guess means never again. I am just 32 and I have a beautiful 4 years old. I hope I atleast get to see her grow up . I dont want to live with this feeling of \"dying\" or \"what if?\" Please share your story if you were in similar situation at this young age and have survived long!!! Log in to post a reply",

Since I am through with chemo and surgery I will start believing that I am in remission and follow the diet , excercise and happiness routine :) :) You are right Agentmo I think the scary bubble might not leave me so soon or would probably stay forever.But I will try to look beyond that. Tom1981, you are such a great support to your wife and you seem so well informed. I did update my profile with diagnosis and treatment , but somehow it does not show in my signature. Lottemarine , I hear you. There are so many things that cancer taught me too.most importantly:life is so precious and there are so many things to be happy about rather than complaining about things you cant change or have. Yatcomw, Ssinuk . Yes I am glad i have a beautiful daughter who is making me smile through this. Will check with my doctor if i can have a break for 2nd child. Else I might adopt a child after a couple years , who might in return bless my life and make it more beautiful.",
