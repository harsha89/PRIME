I was able to see an OT who is lymphedema specialist a couple of days later. She showed me stretching exercises and firmly massaged the three cords she felt/saw. One of them popped right away and I had so much greater range of motion. It was amazing! I agree with the post above that there are different approaches to AWS as there are to many issues raised in this forum. We need to embrace what works best for us. For me, I am going back to my OT for more of the firm massaging this week and cannot wait! Meanwhile, I am stretching every day. Best of luck to everyone here!",

My breast surgeon at Mayo, whose opinion I really value, told me it would be my choice whether to take Tamoxifen. I was supposed to see the oncologist this week to discuss it, but I postponed my appointment until mid-March. I needed some time to get back to normal before I have to research and make another decision. I'm feeling really good now and gearing up to start my research. I would love to know what you were told and what you decide. My info so far is just anecdotal . . . My aunt, who had breast cancer many years ago, tried the Tamoxifen, but had to discontinue use because she actually felt it affected her memory. A sister of a friend who is currently on Tamoxifen (approximately my age, 49) said it is slowing down her metabolism and making her tired. Not what I need at all! By the way, you were smart and brave to have the other side reconstructed at the same time. My plastic surgeon recommended that I have a lift on the other side at the same time as my mastectomy, but I was too chicken. I am now thinking I will take his advice in six months to a year. So far, I'm really happy with how the reconstruction turned out. Sometimes the things you worry about the most turn out to be the easiest. It's funny that way.",

After my drain came out (two weeks post-op) I had 3 cords under my arm originating from the scar of my sentinel node biopsy. I was scheduled for PT, but not for a few weeks out. I called and explained the problem and asked if they could put me on a waitlist for an earlier appointment. Fortunately, they were able to get me in the next week. The PT, who is certified in lymphedema treatment, told me it was axillary web syndrome and she showed me some great stretches and encouraged me to massage the site with my fingers. It has worked really well! Two of the cords are still there, but they are no longer painful or inhibiting my movement. I would call and see if there is any way they can get you into PT sooner. It made all the difference for me. Best of luck!!",

I have another session of PT tomorrow, and I think it might be my last:) Just a note on the bras. I had a unilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction in late January. My PS also recommended I wear a bra 24/7 for the first six weeks and possibly longer. I went for two different bra fittings, one at Nordstrom's and another at a special cancer care boutique. The women who fitted me at both places were so kind and helpful. I really wanted something supportive and yet comfortable. I didn't realize this until recently, but my insurance pays for a certain number of bras each year purchased through approved vendors. It's worth checking out.",

One more thing on the cording that has helped me is massaging the scar of the sentinel node biopsy gently with my fingers. I try to do it after I shower when the skin is still warm. I think it helps break up the scar tissue, which can give you better range of motion. Best of luck!",

Like yours, she explained to me that the benefit of the Tamoxifen would be for the contralateral breast. The worrisome thing for me is that my DCIS was microscopic. All they could see on the imaging (mammogram and MRI) were two small calcifications. Based on that info, I opted for a lumpectomy in December. But the pathology after the lumpectomy showed extensive DCIS, so I then had the mastectomy in January. So, of course, I worry that there is something invisible lurking in my left side, but the surgeon explained to me that the two are \"distant cousins\" not twins, so what is true for the right breast isn't necessarily true for the left. And I have to say that as time passes, I am worrying less each day. I will let you know what the oncologist advises in March. Right now, I am leaning against the Tamoxifen, but I may very well change my mind as I have about other things over the course of this journey . . . Enjoy the rain:)",
