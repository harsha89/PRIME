    "Content": "Sep 19, 2017 09:45PM - edited Sep 19, 2017 09:48PM by kandispaz82 I've been free of cancer for over a year, yet the risidual effects just won't give up. My hair has not grown back to normal...head, eyebrows, eyelashes, legs...you name it. I'm in constant pain. My joints feel weak. Still do not have the stamina I once had. Always have this constant struggle with brain fog and memory. I'm 35. Had stage 1 IDC. HER2 positive...estrogen and progesterone positive. BRCA1 negative. I just want to find myself again amd not feel so old when I'm still so young...#fuckcancer!!!! (Please excuse the language, but I'm just so lost and frustrated)....I just want to be \"me\" again...whatever that is....",
