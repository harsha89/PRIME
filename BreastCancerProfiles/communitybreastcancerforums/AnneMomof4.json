I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders put in on July 20th.  (This was after having a breast reduction in May after which they found LCIS!)  I have had three fills so far and am looking to have the exchange for implant done in November.  There are days when I am ok with it all--I don't have cancer--I NEVER have to wear a bra!  (Strange after all of those years of trying to find one strong enough for my DDDD's!)  There are also days when I get really down--not so much because I loved my \"old\" breasts---they weren't all that cute hanging down to my navel--but because the scars remind me that I will have a \"new normal\"--God, I HATE that! I think it's important to accept how you feel on ALL of your days---a friend told me that at first, your days are 99%crappy--but each day you have a little more time when things are better.  One day you'll feel 50/50 good--eventually, the \"bad\" hours will be the 1% and the good, 99%.  I hope she's right! It'll really help getting the drains out and showering--I promise.  Mentally, I think that's huge toward recovery.  There's also big hormonal changes when removing a  breast--no one warned me about that one--it passed after a few weeks. My huband saw things early on and said--it's not as bad as I'd thought---he just wants me to be HERE.  I do not let him see me often and wear cami's to bed---don't know if that will change. I'm thinking good thoughts for you.  You have a lot to live for.... Anne",
