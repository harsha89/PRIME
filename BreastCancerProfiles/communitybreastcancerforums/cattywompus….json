When I found out I had breast cancer this August I was told if I did a mastectomy w/reconstruction I would not have to do radiation. Once they got in to remove the tumor, the margin were narrow. Because of the narrow margins they say I have a 15-45% chance of the BC coming back if I don't do radiation. I realize I'm lucky and my tumor was small, lymph nodes clean, and I'm a Stage 1. I'm suppose to start radiation in 3 days. I'm afraid if do radiation, after my tissue expander is removed and the implant is then put in, I may get the hardening that happens from radiation. I realize that this can happen 2 yrs or 10yrs down the road. My PS did overfill my tissue expander to make room for my breast possibly shrinking. I never had issues with my implants, which I know some women do even with a typical augmentation. Can anyone calm my fears on what can happen to my breast after radiation and tissue expander is removed. Part of me really wants to cancel the radiation.

The place I am doing radiation does not have a place for cold drinks so I bring my own and drink it afterwards. I'm using plenty of lotion too. Your reply really helped me out. Thank you!",

The PS has me put a cream on it to help with the rash but I'm also suppose to keep up with putting a moisturizing lotion on the breast and it seems that will bring on the rash too. Sometimes it's just a no win situation with the rash. Wish I knew how to get it to stop too.",
