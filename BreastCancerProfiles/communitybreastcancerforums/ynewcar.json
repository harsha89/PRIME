I was not really scared of the cancer diagnosis so much because in retrospect, I was in denial about the whole thing. I joked, I cried at times for my husband, but never really took it seriously, and after the mastectomy, thought I was cured and that was that.  Then last month I had gone to the ER for pain spasms, and they did a CT with contrast and found liver metastasis & possible metastasis on my bladder. The hubs & I have been reeling from this news. We are obviously going to an oncologist to follow up, but I just never gave it a thought that I would be dealing with any kind of cancer again. Naive?? Just a bit. Or denial, maybe a lot. Who knows. Last year, we did hardly any research about what kind of different treatments that we should consider, but this time, it seems we are constantly on the computer looking at statistics and such. I personally, will be taking this as it should be, which is a serious matter, and hoping to write down all the questions that we should have asked before.  I had stopped looking in on these discussion groups, because I thought, oh, since I am \"cured\" I really don't need the support anymore. Just want to let anyone know that reads this, I won't be so cocky this time around, and thank you all for sharing your stories so I can get any & all perspectives on this to help the journey go smoothly.  My husband is my rock, but I storm away at whatever power that is, because we were high school sweethearts that just reconnected 2 years ago. October will only be our second anniversary, and I am so sad that he has been thrown into all of this with me. Don't get me wrong, He always tells me he's glad just to finally be with me, but I still can't get over the guilt of just this cancer madness.  Stupid, I know.",
