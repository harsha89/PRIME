      "Content": "Amyperry wrote: Hi all, I don't want to make this a super long post, but the problems I have been experiencing have been going on for quite a while so I'll backtrack a little bit. I have been to several doctors (2 at a breast surgeon's office and my ob/gyn) and all have said my symptoms do not lead to IBC because I don't have the classic symptoms. As I've searched on this site and others, I've learned that no two diagnoses of IBC are alike and therefore symptoms can vastly range. Last year in December I started to experience pain, tenderness and a very heavy feeling in my right breast. This breast has always been bigger than my left, but within the last several months seems to have gotten fuller. I went to see my ob/gyn in December and she said it was probably a hormonal problem (I had a hysterectomy in Jan.) and not IBC because I didn't have a rash (however, in 20 years she's only seen 1 case and that one had a distinct rash). The discomfort went away until late March/April. Went back in to see her and again she said it was nothing. Then came late June and the discomfort intensified and my breast seemed to have days where it looked blotchy pink and then it would go away. This nipple is not inverted, but it is constantly sore and sticking out. I have discomfort under my breast and sometimes around to my back and in the armpit. There is no rash, no redness, no skin thickening (that I can tell), no orange peel skin or enlarged lymph nodes. The only symptoms I have is a larger right breast, constant discomfort (ranges from painful to just sore and sometimes a pricking-like pain), and occasional blotchy pink skin on the one side of my breast (the area of pinkness has not gotten any bigger). These symptoms have been on a consistent basis since June. In July I had a mammo/us done, both came back negative, bi-rads was 1 and I was told I have very fatty breasts. In August I had another us done, same thing. In October I had another us done, bi-rads went to a 2 but nothing else was found. I was not given an explanation as to why I went from a bi-rads of 1 to 2. The explanations I have been given are: non-cyclical breast pain (which I have done everything and more to control, no caffeine, sports bras, vitamin E and evening primrose oil, no chocolate, limited soy and salt, heating/cooling pad, ibuprofen), fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel, and neck and shoulder strain (I don't even have pain in those areas so I'm ruling that one out). I don't think it's a hormonal problem because according to the nurse practitioner at one of the breast surgeon's offices, hormones would affect both breasts, not just one. My ob/gyn has me going for an MRI for one final check. I am at all loss and have two little children and made the mistake of putting my symptoms into google and pretty much all that appears is IBC. I am not looking for a diagnosis, and I know that is not the reason for this forum, but rather some support that I am not crazy and I'm doing the right thing by pursuing this. I feel a fool going into a breast surgeon's office when other women sitting around me are true breast cancer fighters, it makes me feel selfish. Has anyone else diagnosed with IBC have a similar story to mine? Are MRI's more advanced at detecting breast abnormalities and cancer than a mammo? Forgive me for the long post.

The imaging center I am going to is opening hours on Sunday because there are a lot of women needing imaging, so that\u2019s when I am going. Should I mention to the tech that I need the radiologist to look specifically for IBC symptoms or is this a standard? Also, what characteristic are shown on MRI for IBC? I\u2019m just trying to gain as much info as I can so I\u2019m asking the right questions. Can you explain why a bi-rads of 1 would go to a 2",
