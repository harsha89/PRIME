Im still having some neuropathy that comes and goes still. Now I have started Herceptin again once every 3 weeks. Today when i went to get my 5th dose for the year 2011Â i was told that my echocardiogram showed my ejection fraction is 45% and referred to a cardiologist before i can continue my herceptin. Is this bad? Anyone ever had this happen and will i have to permanently stop Herceptin? Any comments is appreciated Kathy Dx 3/12/2010, Paget's, Stage II, 5/17 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
