What I have learned is that two surgeons from two institutions gave me to different opinions; 1) remove around each area the tissue vs. 2) remove one larger sphere tissue which includes the tissue in between. I discussed with a friend who is a Pathologist and she said it is more precise in the pathology if one block or sphere of tissue is removed rather than two. They can more precisely test if there is cancer in the tissue between the two areas of DCIS by excising it. Therefore, both approaches are 'correct', it comes down to how much risk are you willing to take. They can try to line up the margins on the two areas that are removed to see if the ink or dye shows up on the same side that faces one another but it may not be as precise. I think this comes down to how cautious and accurate you want to be. I am concerned that the 2nd doctor I went to wants t remove so much tissue that from a cosmetic perspective I may be better with Mastectomy cause then I do not have to do radiation. I am working through this decision as fast and thoroughly as possible at the same time. I am considering a bilateral mastectomy due to very strong family history with my mother and grandmother having had cancer. So even if I have the lumepctomy, I have a 20 to 25% chance of getting cancer in the other breast and if I take tomoxifen it will reduce it by 50%. So I am having a very difficult decision about my treatment. I am going to see a plastic surgeon and hopefully that will provide me some perspective on the reconstructive process. I am with Sloan Kettering right now - Dr. Heerdt and Dr. Disa. I have not had any surgery yet but believe both doctors have excellent reputations. Appreciate any insights!",
