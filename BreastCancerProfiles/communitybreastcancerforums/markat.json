Some have to keep them in longer, it just depends on your surgeon and what their protocol is for the amount the drainage needs to be under. The first 6 weeks was the hardest, but I feel so much better now. I also had chemo before so I think that adds to the recovery time. Our bodies need a little extra healing time.

Rachel the pain is easing up from the port tonight. I hope yours is too. If not, maybe call your surgeon. Now I seem to be having an allergic reaction to the tape though. Ugh! Mardi I hope you get some rest tonight. Gina I hope you feel better. I have no experience yet with that type of burn, but I thought that generally burns should be left uncovered. I wish you all the best!",

My husband has never shaved his so he's nervous about it. Like an idiot I overslept today and missed my MRI. It was either rush and get my girls ready for school or myself, and of course I chose them. They rescheduled for tomorrow. Rachel that is so scary! I started the day after my first treatment and it was horrible. I hope you're doing ok! Terry good luck today!",

I still haven't gotten the nipples or had my port taken out- I'm just taking the year off of stuff. Glad everyone's hair is doing well :) Mine is still a thick fluff ball. I'm trying to grow it back to bob length so my stylist won't cut it too short. The top layers are finally starting to grow a little. My mom passed away at the end of May from a short stint with aggressive lung cancer. That's made our summer a little difficult again. Hugs to all!!",
