Glad to hear your tests are only a few days away (which I know at this point, can seem like an eternity!) When looking for information, I try to stay right here on BCO. I venture out into google land on occasion, but honestly, most everything I've looked for is shared right here by a group of incredibly intellignet, compassionate women who've been through it all! Hang in there! Maryann",
