Best Doctors expert had the same estimate I came up with using AdjuvantOnline! for genotypes -- chemo would reduce my risk by 50%. That translates into a recurrence risk that is lower by 3-4%, which he didn't think was enough to warrant chemo! I called my original oncologist and told her I wanted to go ahead with it. Now (finally) she says she would do the same thing if it were her. I will see her on Friday to find out the date.",

So a person in low intermediate has a lower chance of recurrence than a person in high intermediate (mine was high intermediate but in TailoRx everyone with my score gets chemo, so I chose to do chemo despite 2 out of 3 consults who said no chemo). It's a very individual decision, how much risk you can accept. With my score of 28, plugged into the adjuvant online program, I would get a 3-4% benefit from chemo. That means that 3 or 4 women out of 100 with my score who had chemo would not get metastatic cancer. My reasoning is that if I am one of those 3 or 4, I would rather do the chemo. I may be doing it for nothing except a whole lot of SEs, or I may be saving my life. Some people would probably prefer to avoid chemo unless their score was a lot higher. One of my consults didn't even trust the oncotype test because it was \"too new,\" but he's way out of line. Oncotype results have been incorporated into the clincal recommendations of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Here are links to those guidelines: jco.ascopubs.org/cgi/content/a...  http://www.nccn.org/",

I am leaning toward agressive treatment and wish I had gotten started on it sooner. The delay was because my first oncologist was using old guidelines and because the office is overwhelmed and incompetent (a Mash unit, as one of their NPs called it). Yesterday, three months after surgery, I finally cried for the first time --at the frustration of the whole process. It was set off by my three year-old whacking me in the chest where I used to have a breast (didn't hurt). He calls it \"a breast askident.\"",

The problem is that they really don't know whether you will be one of the few who benefit or not. For me at 18%, I don't know whether I'm one of the 6 out of a hundred women who will benefit from chemo, or one of the 12 who will get metastatic disease no matter what, or I'm one of the 82 who don't need it. I know people who have decided against chemo based on various personal reasons, so as people say it's a very individual decision. I would ask your oncologist whether he or she has given chemo to people with lupus or knows of their response to treatment.",

Two weeks later, I saw an oncologist who said \"no chemo\" because small tumor, estrogen positive, no nodes, but she was OK doing the oncotype test at my request. She managed to make two months pass before I got my test results, but now I have a recurrence score of 28, which is 18% chance of metastatic disease within 10 years. She still says no chemo, but I know that everyone in the TAILORx study with a score over 25 is getting chemo, so now I'm thinking chemo is a pretty likely choice. Guess my onc (at a major cancer center) doesn't hold much stock in the oncotype test, because she quoted bad statistics to me--\"only 1.5% improvement within chemo\" but my reading of the genomic version of AdjuvantOnline is at minimum a 33% reduction in metastatic disease with chemo (statistically, that's going from 18% to 12%). BTW my age is 58 and we have four adopted kids from age 3 to 11, so I want to do what I can to minimize my risk. I'm seeing another oncologist for second opinion and preparing psychologically, if that is possible, for a long slog. I'm feeling rather let down and distrustful of the experts now. I'm in the uncomfortable position of second guessing the experts. Anyone been there?

But if you look at the results of this clinical trial by Paik (www.breastcancerupdate.com/mia... you see that intermediate range of 18-30 had a 1% benefit from chemo and the high range (greater than 31) had a 28% benefit. Obviously there was not a jump between 1% at a score of 30 and 28% at a score of 31, which is why the TailoRx is using different ranges and looking at the benefits within a range. My guesstimate of my score of 28 is something like a 5-10% benefit, but we won't really know until the TailorX completes.",
