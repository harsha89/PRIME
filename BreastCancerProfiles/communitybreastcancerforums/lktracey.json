I have no real history of breast cancer in my family either (maternal great aunt only), but I wanted to have a peace of heart after all this and knew that 1. I wanted to be cancer free for the rest of my life (God willing) 2. wanted to have symmetrical reconstruction and 3. Didn't want to negotiate around an implant the rest of my life to figure out if I had any cancer in the remaining breast. Do your research, trust your instincts, and let your head and heart guide your path to making yourself well again. Good luck and God bless! Lauren",

The energy level is down too.  No gym right away yet.  That sucks!! Want to combat this steroid fat! I know it'll settle down, but I am craving some sort of \"normal\" back again.  I know I have a few more months for that... but I want it now!! Cut the hair shorter yesterday during my midnight steroid high!  Now getting the buzz on Saturday.  For all the drama I had about losing it, I was never so ready to shed the limp, thin yuck!  I was tired of clumps of hair everywhere. I had outpaced the Lab in shedding factor! It is like a relief and weight lifted.  What a difference a week makes!!! I hope you all see good days ahead, and if not, then positive thoughts and restful days. Lauren",

I must say, not withstanding the side effects to come, it kind of felt like a little spa day.  I had my daughters favorite fuzzy blanket, my trusty neck pillow, my ipod, a great book and I texted and read my emails.  I started got there at 9 and didn't leave till 3:30 due to a slow start, the complications, etc. but I am good.  I didn't realize though after, till my friend asked me what I was on because I was talking a mile a minute- steroid high.  I had this huge burst of energy, played with the dog, took my daughter to celebrate my conquering of the chemo to Baskin Robbins.  Now I am coming off my \"speed\".

I still giggle at that!!! My wigs have turned out to be very comfortable though and I add a cute hat with or without them and actually am having fun with it all!  Small favors. I did go to dinner Monday with a group of friends to a hibachi bar and had to warn the chef not to melt my hair with his fire show before the cooking began.

Cleaned the kitchen, cleaned out the junk drawer, folded laundry and started another 2 loads. Got my daughter and hubby off to school and work.  My husband snidely commented that I should have started taking it 14 years ago if it was gonna get me motivated to do that much housework - MEN! He knew when he married me I was NOT a domestic diva! So, what is the timeline for the Neulasta SE's?  I got the shot yesterday around noon and I was prepared to feel like crap today, so I am scrambling to get stuff done before it hits! I hope everyone has a great day today.  Will be off and on depending on how this day goes and what kind of trouble I can get into - hee hee! Lauren",

I have had nausea and fatigue so bad this time.  The first round was easy peasy, now I am actually feeling sick.  It really makes me mad!! Before, yes, I had cancer, had surgery, started chemo.... Life going on. Then screeeeechhhh!  Life to a halt, no meds to keep the nausea at bay, and the darn Neulasta shot has me hurting this time too!  It sucks! Stupid cancer, stupid chemo!!! Thank goodness it's only 4.  I don't know how you ladies do it with work.  I was down and out the last few days.  I go to the PS today for a fill, and if were not for the thought of getting a \"boob fill up\", I'd probably be in bed again most of the day.  I forced myself up yesterday and dragged myself to Smoothie King to find something I could tolerate.  And guess what God did??? He sent this young man there for me.  This guy is the co-owner and have never seen him in there before, but he was my angel yesterday.  I walked in and explained I had chemo, nothing tasted right or good, and I needed something.... He goes on to tell me that his sister went through chemo and rad tx for over a year and he understood completely. We whipped up the perfect smoothie for me, complete with protein powder and energy booster.  He was meant to be there for me. Granted, it took me about 3 hours to get it all down, but it actually tasted good and settled the nausea.  So, taking those little \"God winks\" and running with them these days. My what a different perspective from the first round of chemo till now..... Kind of dread #3... Hope everyone has a great day and weekend! Lauren",

So, today my nausea started the same, but by the time we were ready to go to the PS for my fill, I was actually feeling a little better. My PS made me feel good though and said no worries on the tightness in the right foob.  No more antibiotics! Yeah!   Plus, we filled again today and I must say, I am lovin' the way the new girls are filling out.  I told my husband that I didn't care if he had to drag me half unconscious, I was getting a fill up today!  Hope you ladies have a great weekend. I am off to rest again. Lauren ",

Be sure to let the chemo nurse know about the nausea and they can offer several different types of meds.  I was prescribed two different ones. msbusdriver: love the tape idea. I was thinking lint roller too. I hope everyone keeps their hair for Christmas, then let the follicles fall where they may! I am going this week to get some little caps, night cap, and some scarves. Good night of sleep but woke up with heart burn up high in sternum and back of throat. Tums helped alot and sipped water fow a few hours.  Well, my oj now tastes sour.  Gonna move on to another juice...  Not alot metallic taste today, so small favors there. Had my handy wipes for the chemo release peeing.  Man, thanks for that little tip! And as far as these pasties, I am so boob centered right now, I am thinking the little stripper things!  Man, I need a life. I think ya'lls pasties sound like empanadas, huh?  They also sound close to what Northern Louisiana calls \"meat pies\". I like pasties better, hee hee! Lauren",

I was scared to death to start chemo, with the hair loss being my biggest hangup. Now, it's all gravy.  Once the hair goes, I am home free. Your tx will go so quickly and I pray effortlessly for you!

Lisa, You and your family deserve a good 2009 after all the cancer and hairloss!  I will keep you all in my prayers.  Speaking of, my latest pet peeve is when people say \"you are sooo lucky\" to be doing so well... NO, it's not luck, it's prayers, blessings and positive thoughts.  I don't believe it's luck,or LUCK would have let me keep my breasts, my hair, my sanity and hit the Powerball! God has guided us through all this, not Luck.. Okay, off the soap box now! You can tell the hairloss thing is getting to me, I'm getting more pissy by the moment! Simvog - you have your pity party - we all get to have one now and again- we deserve it!  It is okay, because your sisters in Survivorhood are here for you!! Hope everyone had a great day.  Went to see Bedtime Stories with my daughter.  It was worth the trip out and very funny! Lauren",
