It's nice then to visit these threads and hear from others in 'same boat' and feel a tie - I save that for here.  And with my close friends and family, if they ask, I share some specifics, otherwise,  I'm living my life, functioning with my family and carrying out routines as normally as possible.  Here's to coping in different ways!   ",

Don't know about post treatment scans, but my insurance pays 100% for dx test.  I didn't have to get the PET pre certified.   What's the difference of getting a mammogram yearly when you have no symptoms before cancer vs MRI and bone scans post - as it's common knowledge that bc -   if it were to come back would commonly be lung, bone, or brain.   I would like to believe that I'll have 'NO CANCER' after chemo, surgery, etc. , but does your doctor know for certain that there are no lingering cells anywhere? -    I'm not there yet, but it seems there are many on here that mention the routine scans following treatment - sounds like the norm. I'm regretting not being more persistent in the past with this 'fibrocystic' thing - - ANYWAY.  Moving forward, I'm more informed and speaking up - and so far, getting what I want! Had it not been for this forum, going solely on Dr's orders, I wouldn't be getting recon w/ mx - (he wouldn't do before radiation) - For me, this is a quality issue - AND I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR FINDING YOU ALL - and that I'll have some kind of boobs this summer:)  (too shallow?)   Di Di",

Was really careful after chemo started, until I realized, it really, for me, wasn't making any difference.  I was really in the sun all summer  - spent two weeks at the beach in FL between my 2nd and 3rd AC txs - I did over do a little then - got a mild case of sun poisoning - which I'm prone too anyway. So, as far as the tanning bed, I figure it's kinda the same thing...I don't know if Taxol is any different, but I was in there 10 minutes and it really didn't do anything, so I'm gonna get in a couple times this week... I'm planning on pool exercise at the fitness club and don't want to 'go public' in a swim suit anyway, so maybe a little color will help (it'll make me feel better anyway) So, take that for what it is...I doubt that any doctor would ever 'bless' tanning beds, especially now -   About the head - I kinda forgot, I actually got in there this summer trying to 'tan my head' - I too had used self tanner, but didn't like that my sheets 'got the tan' with the night sweats!!

Good Luck Vickie with surgery!!!!    Joanie10 - I'm hearing from my onc and chemo nurses that the weekly taxol is so much more tolerable than every 3 wk tx as dose is lower.  Not sure how they decide which way to treat?  I feel kinda guilty that I'm feeling so well.  Thoroughly enjoy you spa break - it sounds wonderful.  That's the downside of weekly treatment...very difficult to plan 'getaways' - before you know it, you're back in the chair...BUT ONLY 4 MORE TO GO!!!  That reminds me, I need to update my info below...

My preference was 2 wks.  They (bs & ps) said that would be no prob, as it was early and schedule open. However, by the time the 'coordinator' called me to schedule for Dec 14th, she didn't realize I need bs & ps so she had to go back to 'coordinate' and by the time she got back to me, my date was gone and she was trying to push me back to the end of Dec or Jan 1st - I was not happy, and let her know it.     I guess you could say, we compromised, she got me in on the 18th of December... So, be assertive, plan ahead and get what you want.....and what YOU NEED.  Not at their convenience...:)  The longer it takes for you to get an appt, the further back you may be on surgery schedule..   Actually the girl they scheduled on my date, the 14th came in after I did, with a sob story that she had family coming to take care of her and that was the only week they could come.  I, like I said, was a little bitchy and told her I was there first, and had they bothered to see what my circumstances were?   I of course, felt bad all day for being crabby, and called and apologized...anyway, we all gotta vent some time!   Good Luck!

Dx'd in June, that day, surgeon told me he didn't want me going to Florida in July. Well, oncologist disagreed, minimal se from chemo - had second dose of AC before going to Navarre Beach for 2 weeks - logged too many hours in the sun and got a little sun poison which put me under the umbrella for the last 5 days, but all things considered, grateful was able to go! Was curious about your tx plan...are you doing chemo then surgery then more chemo? My surgeon recommended this (I think surgeons just want to do surgery), but my oncologist recommended that chemo be completed prior to surgery. For one thing, said hair would start growing back and then fall out again - which would be kind of a bummer. She also said that the goal of chemo is to downstage the cancer before surgery - and that there are cells that may not be detected, that there'd be better chance of 'getting' it - also lymph node involvement dtermines radiation therapy recommendations - I guess the more chemo the better? I'm still very early in the tx too - having third dose of chemo this Friday - This site has been a God send for me as I'm sure it already has been for you too. It does seem apparent that everyone's responses and experiences are unique, but for me, thus far, chemo hasn't been bad. Sure they'll be days ahead form the cumulative effect. I am curious about your surgery, please let me know - and I'm envious of your proximity to the BEACH! Di Di",
