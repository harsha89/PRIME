I think i make it worst, it starting to hurt me more than before when i move n pick up certain things certain ways. When i pressed on one of my cervical spine i can feel that one spot n i can feel that sensation radiate to my shoulder. It doesn't keep me a wake at night. I can feel the sensation if i moved my neck but it doesn't keep me a wake or bothers me at night.

She just said it just a standard precedure when you get abnormal result from a mammogram.  I asked her is there something that i need know, and Dr is hiding from me.  She  said No, we didn't hide anything from you, we won't know the result until you have biopsy done.  My doctor scared me even more.  The same day when I got home, I received a letter my radiologist saying that the result come out abnormal and i have dense breast.  Dense breast women are at higher risk for breast cancer. I was shaking and i can't even eat.    I have two young kids and i cried my eyes out every night.

I don't want to wait that long till May or June.  I asked for PET Scan.  I had PET scan on Jan 31 last Friday.  I am so nervous and tried my best not think about the results.  MO called today at 3pm, nothing show up on my liver and all my organs are clean, no spot.  I am so sick of this stupid cancer.  Every month seems like always something pop up.  So hard for me to move on .  Lyn, your hair a little thicker than mine....lucky you.  I never lost all my eyebrows.  I used Brian Joseph for my eyebrows (maybe that helps).    I still have my eyebrows but lost a lot of my eyes lashes, especially the bottom part. ",

I am still undecided btwn the two, since survival rate is the same.
