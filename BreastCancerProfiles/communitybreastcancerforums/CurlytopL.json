I'm almost halfway through (9 out of 20 done - last 4 will be boosts), and so far, so good. Getting a bit pinkish, but actually felt better week two than week one - the nerve \"zaps\" settled down, and my skin seems overall less sensitized. I'm using Miaderm in the dressing room after treatment, and midday and night either more Miaderm or Cerave Baby Cream. My treatments are in the prone position, which is going well; somehow I feel less vulnerable that way - maybe because the machine doesn't loom over me - well, it does, but I can't see it! Enjoy the rest of your weekends - the break is certainly nice. And next weekend, for those of us in the US, will be a 3-day break!",

My initial biopsy/diagosis was done locally, but I shifted care to a well-respected national cancer center in a nearby city for surgery/followup/medical oncology. I've now met with the radiation oncologist at the national center, and was surprised to learn that they don't offer breast cancer radiation in the prone position. They do apparently have DIBH (deep inspiration breath hold). The local community/regional cancer center (where I was originally diagnosed) DOES offer prone position, DIBH and \" regular\" supine position therapy; when I met with them prior to making the switch to the national center, the RO had suggested those as possible options. Naturally, no one can tell without a planning session which option would be best for a particular patient. My cancer is left-sided, so I'm especially concerned about sparing my heart from radiation. My dilemma is - if I stick with the national cancer center for their presumably greater volume and expertise, I miss out on possible benefits of prone-positioning. If I treat locally, prone positioning is offered, but I forfeit the expertise of the well-respected national cancer center. What to do? Thanks, and good health to everyone!

Runrcb, from what I've read, the planning sessions/scans in various positions are what enable them to figure out where/what the treatment beams will cross. Once they assess that, they can decide which positions/techniques deliver the right dose to the right areas, while minimizing scatter dosage to the unwanted areas, like heart, lungs, etc. Then the best option can be chosen. It's apparently quite variable from patient to patient. They can guess who might be candidates, but need those precise measurements to make the call. Ingerp: Thanks for your first-hand info on the DIBH. I think I'd be fine with that, assuming my anatomy checks out appropriately. I've got pretty good breath control, and don't expect to have trouble with that kind of timing. I'd just be interested to know which approach would keep my heart and lungs more removed from the treatment field. Best of luck to you in your second go-round with breast cancer. Happy, healthy healing thoughts to you both.  ",
