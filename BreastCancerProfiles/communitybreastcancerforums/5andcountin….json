I will pray all is well and that everything is benign.  But please know this, if the worst happens, it is still ok.  I was dxd in October and am finishing my last chemo today. It is \"doable\". Not fun, but you can do it. My mom is seven years out from breast cancer and doing fine. It is not an automatic death sentence...I crawled into my bed for the first two weeks and cried and cried until my family, friends, and God yanked me out. I have had love and support and have even dated during my chemo. Xanax can help with anxiety if you have a bad report and this site can be good. Just don't read too much, you will make yourself crazy! Hange in there, knowing and planning is better than being stuck in the unknown zone.",

I talked with so many doctors before it finally sunk in that it wouldn't lessen my chance of distant metz. Yes, local recurrence was slightly higher (1-3%) but what they told me is that if there were local recurrence, it most likely meant there were cells elsewhere in the body as well. That being said, they  told me if I would sleep better at night, have the mastectomy. It is so individual, there is no right answer. One surgeon said the only wrong answer was doing nothing and given my relatively early stage, either option was a good option. This is one of the hardest decisions of my life, as it has been for all of you. I recommend doing what you can live with. If the cancer comes back locally, and you know you couldn't forgive yourself, then have the mastectomy. Just don't look back with decisions you make or it can make you crazy.",

Risk of distant metz doesn't change with lumpectomy and radiation versus mastectomy.  I met with four surgeons before I was able to let that one sink in. You can have the mastectomy and decrease the local recurrence. But what I worry about it the  distant. Local recurrence can be handled quickly with surgery. I had lumpectomy as well. I sleep easy with that decision after consulting with so many docs. I have grade III, 1.9 cm with one node. Aggressive chemotherapy is our best shot at never having to deal with this again. I am triple negative, praying for you that you have some hormone positive, more guns to shoot at it!  Hang in there!",

I was diagnosed in early November, had lumpectomy and now port and will start chemo next week. My mother is six years out (we are both triple negative so I'd actually like to have herceptin to put in my arsenol!) It will get better. It will still be scary, sometimes more than others but that overwhelming wake up painic that screams CANCER CANCER CANCER will abate some. Please let people love and support you. Ask them if they don't volunteer it, some of them are as scared as you are. Let them know what you need.  Don't be afraid to ask your doctor for sleep meds, anxiety meds, depression meds.  I never took those before but they are good coping tools to help right now. I also availed myself of a counselor to help.  It doesn't mean you aren't strong if you utilize these things. Strong, smart women use everything they can to get through this. It's okay to \"fight dirty\". If you don't already pray, meditate, or have some sort of spiritual connection, get one. God will listen any time.  I will pray for you and all of us that have a rough few months coming up. But this too will pass!",

Rock, I don't know why any of us have to deal with this but you have certainly helped hundreds of us and are a truly remarkable soul. Thank you so very much. I will have AC(4rounds) followed by T (4 rounds) every two weeks with Neurlasta after each treatment.  I'm scared but determined to finish all this as soon as possible and live my life again.The radiation following the chemo seems like a breeze to me right now. I had thought I'd buy a treadmill to help me exercise in winter, do you think a stationary bike better? ",

      "Content": "Dec 20, 2009 08:27AM - edited Dec 20, 2009 08:28AM by 5andcounting Hey girls, I had my port in on Wednesday. I agree it was worse than the intitial surgery (lumpectomy with all nodes removed) but I think that's because I thought it would be \"no big deal\". It hurts, I can only sleep one uncomfortable way, hurts when I move my formerly \"good\" right arm, and in general just \"sucks\".  However, I need this port. The chemo (AC followed by T) is every 2 weeks and would destroy my veins and I trust my surgeon and oncologist. I am a nurse and don't give them this trust lightly..find someone you trust and follow their recommendations. None of us deserve this or signed up for this but we will get through it. I want my port removed the day I finish chemo. I want to be done with this forever but I'll have to do what God has planned and not what I want. I am finding that living in the present is the only coping strategy that is allowing me any peace of mind and staying positive is sometimes hard.  I start chemo on my sons 18th birthday (Dec. 30) and am trying to stay strong. Theres no shame is asking for pain meds, or using guided images or accupuncture or anything else that works. You are all in my thoughts and prayers. ",
