I'm really sorry you have the added stress of not having insurance or a job added to a possible BC scare. It's very important to make sure you get treated now, and worry about how to pay for it later though.  My husband's aunt died from a heart attack because she wouldn't let her family members take her to the hospital because she wan't insured.  If you do have BC, you need to start getting treated. There are a lot of great people on here who care about you, and we wish you the very best!",

ALH/ADH are basically just that - a precancer.  It's not cancer yet, but it puts you at a bit higher risk than someone who doesn't have it.  When ALH/ADH are found upon biopsy, standard procedure is to do an excisional biopsy (surgical removal of the area) to further test it through pathology as approx. 20-25% of the time there may be very early LCIS/DCIS or even very early invasive breast cancer hiding amongst the ALH/ADH. If no cancer is found, then you will likely face frequent future screenings by mammogram, ultrasound, breast exams, and/or MRI.  Many of us are in this situation, and that will likely be your outcome also. If cancer is found, they will do lots of testing on the pathology of it, and keep in mind it would likely be LCIS or a very early stage cancer which is highly treatable and not very life threatening. I think all of us here can say by experience that the time for you between now and when you get the pathology results is very stressful.  The best thing you can do is turn to people like you find here for support, and educate yourself on your condition.  This web site has great information, as do the people who have walked this path here. Questions you can ask your surgeon is how much tissue he/she expects to remove, how soon will you know the pathology results, will he call with the results or do you find out at a future appt with him, do you need further testing before the excisional biopsy, is there only one area of concern, do you need to be seen by an oncologist for possible hormone therapy (like Tamoxifen or Evista). *Hugs* and best wishes!",

The purpose of an excisional biopsy when ADH is found is to remove some of the tissue to see if there is some cancer mixed in.  It's not necessary to get clean margins, and not at all necessary to remove it all. My BS said that most likely I have many other small areas of ADH also, but they are not yet showing up on a mammogram.  However, once the microcalcifications do show up on a mammogram in a certain type of clustered pattern they then need to do a stereotactic biopsy, then excisional biopsy again if ADH is found to rule out cancer being present.  I think it's a natural reaction to want cancer or precancer all out so that psychologically we can relax.  However, ADH is kind of a no man's land where you don't have cancer, yet you're not normal either.  Unfortunately, once you have ADH you may very well be in for a roller coaster of testing, surgeries, and emotional ups and downs.  I don't like that I have ADH, but I'm starting to become at peace with it, and I realize that I still have a lot of good life yet to live.  I don't look forward to going through all testing and such, but I'm coming to grips with that fact that this is now part of who I am. ",

I joined this club this past November with two areas of ADH found with a stereotactic biopsy, followed by an excisional biopsy which found rather extensive ADH in both areas.  I can completely relate to your feelings of anxiety, anger, and frustration.  I dread having to go back for my 6 month check up, even though we should be thankful for this technology because it helps the doctors determine the best course of action to help us.  I've been told by some to think of these tests as my friends, but if that's the case I have some really mean friends lol! Sparky, I hope all goes well with your upcoming surgery!  I think I'd make the same decisions you've made regarding how extensive to go.  I'm a large C cup and lost a fair amount of my breast that the excisional biopsy was done on since there were two areas, but I still have plenty there. Julz, just to let you know, my BS ordered an MRI before my excisional biopsy because he said he wanted to make sure he was doing the right surgery and the right amount of surgery.  However, my insurance company requires pre-authorizations for breast MRI because they are expensive (around $3,000 - $5,000).  My insurance company denied mine saying ADH isn't a reason for a breast MRI because it hasn't been shown to save or prolong lives in clinical studies.  My BS said it's just been fairly recent that insurance companies are denying breast MRI's, so be aware you may run into the same issue, although I really hope you don't.  He said he thinks I'm at high risk of my ADH turning into cancer, so he said he plans to do frequent monitoring so that if or when it does turn to cancer it would be found at a very early, treatable stage.  Best wishes to both of you!",

Also, keep in mind that the quote of a lifetime risk of ADH women developing BC being 20-25% means the chance of developing invasive BC.  Far more than that go on to develop DCIS or LCIS, but again, there aren't any statistics on those rates that I'm aware of. Regarding the studies that cite ADH possibly being associated with hormonal changes, I've read it in more than one place but don't remember the exact study.  I know one is mentioned on a web site that I don't think I can mention here, where some experts from a large breast center in the US answer questions that people post in various forums.  One of their experts is a BC survivor herself!",

You may already know this, but a lumpectemy is the term used when cancer has already been found (usually on biopsy), and an excisional biopsy is when cancer hasn't been found yet but may be a possibility due to factors such as ADH.  While the surgeries have a lot of similarities, they also have some differences.  In excisional biopsies they don't care about clean margins (unless cancer is subsequently found in the tissue that is removed), and they don't test lymph nodes as they may in a lumpectomy. The term you use above is lumpectomy, so I'm curious if your surgeon's research is only for women who have already been found to have cancer on a biopsy and will be having a lumpectomy, or if it includes data also for women who have ADH and will be having an excisional biopsy.  The insurance standards are very different for these 2 scenarios.",

A single finding of ADH with no other risk factors isn't reason to have a mastectomy.  The vast majority of ADH cases never go on to become anything more sinister. If you have a breast cancer gene (which you now know you don't), every member of your family has had BC, or have busy breasts with lots of biopsies with the finding of ADH each time, then you might want to consider such a drastic measure. It's a natural reaction for us to want anything abnormal out, and when I was first diagnosed with ADH I felt the same way.  It was a diagnosis I didn't want to be part of.  Although there's no BC in my immediate family, both of my parents and all of my aunts and uncles have had cancer, and I have lost a number of family members to cancer.  When I got the phone call after my mammogram to come back for a biopsy I was absolutely numb. The truth is that few, if any, insurance companies will pay for a mastectomy if you've had a single incidence of ADH, and rightfully so.  Mastectomies and reconstruction are very expensive, and there can be complications as it's a major surgery.  On the other hand, if after a few years you've undergone 4 biopsies and excisional biopsies that show ADH, then your insurance company would probably gladly pay for a mastectomy to avoid all the other future costs. My BS said his approach with me is to watch me closely so that if cancer were to develop, it would be caught at a very early, very treatable stage.  I'm only being checked on every 6 months with mammograms, so you're getting followed much closer than most of us. Hang in there, it does get easier. Am I to assume you have a family history of BC since you had genetic testing?",

They just don't understand what we go through being on pins and needles with the regular screenings, biopsies, and surgeries.  I've decided to take the opportunity to educate them about ADH and BC risks, and send the message to get regular mammograms for them and all the women they know.  Even with all the BC education there is out there, I falsely thought that if you have BC there would be a lump, not realizing at all that there are BC's associated with rashes or microcalcifications that can have no symptoms at all. I will agree though that it's frustrating that there seems to be little support out there for women who only have ADH, so come here or find other places you can talk to other women for ADH and we can support each other.",
