My skin generally did pretty well. The most difficult is on my collarbone and a little up the neck which is getting dry and starting to open up a tiny bit. Since I didn't have any positive nodes in that area I asked the RO why and she said it was preventative. I presume this will get worse before it gets better. If it has killed any remaining cancer cells hanging around then it was worth it. My chemo side effects are still with me - neuropathy on the finger tips, some hearing loss, atrial fibrillation. Could have been worse I guess. Now have to get past the worry of recurrence. It makes me p.o.ed that there will not be regular follow up scans i.e. Pet, bone, etc. Supposed to wait until symptoms occur which seems kind of crazy. I will have follow up blood work and 3-D mammos alternately with MRI mammo. Perhaps that's enough but doesn't make a lot of sense to me. This has been an almost year long journey for me and I pray everyday that I never have to walk this road again. I have had the most marvelous support in a very caring husband, supportive children and friends who have been where I was. That part could not have been better. Wishing everyone the best and rest assured that it will be over sooner than you think. I promise. Gussy",

I will have my first treatment today after the \"line everything up\" yesterday. I'll have 30 treatments so this will put me done the end of May. This has been going on since the end of June last year when first diagnosed so VERY happy to see some light coming up. I had a 6+ cm tumor but slow growing so hopeful about that. Partial mastectomy, chemo before and now the rads. It really is poison, slash and burn! Perhaps some day this will all look barbarous and new treatments will evolve. Thanks to everyone for the tips on skin care. My RO didn't recommend much of anything so will start with moisturizers and aloe vera when things start to heat up. Best wishes to all who are in radiation.",

I saw a plastic surgeon this past week and she was not encouraging re: reconstruction. What kind of reconstruction did you have prior to radiation? That was the big thing for her - she said that the radiation changed the structure of the breast that it wasn't good for implants but might be able to do some small amount of fat grafting to fill in any small dents. And would do a reduction and lift on the other side. To be honest, I don't have a lot to spare! I see so many that have reconstruction at the time of initial surgery that I wonder how it goes for women who have radiation afterward. Thanks for any input. Gussy",

The last one in June showed only enlarged nodes on the left. Primary phys. wisely sent me for an MRI immediately which showed a 5 cm. tumor. Went to Moffit CC for biopsy and dx - IDC e/p pos, hr2 neg. I decided to have tx in home town. BS decided that I should have chemo first then another MRI to see if it worked, if so, hopefully, a lumpectomy instead of mastectomy. The chemo shrunk it 50% or more so am scheduled for surgery Mar. 5. Then radiation afterwards, anti-hormone therapy after that. If the lumpectomy takes a lot of volume, which it may, I plan on having whatever reconstruction needed even though I'm a younger looking 79. I mentioned to BS and onc. about shouldn't women with dense breasts have MRI's every 5 years - the answer - insurance won't pay for routine MRI. BS thinks this tumor could have been developing for 10 years! Unbelieveable. I also had US at Moffit and tech couldn't see a thing although she had the MRI picture/position in front of her. She was amazed and frustrated. So far, chemo is over and had more side effects with Taxol than the A/C which has been disappointing but I can see that things are resolving a bit after only three weeks post last dose. Still hairless though. BS says that from now on I will have only MRI exams which is comforting.",
