Have a good weekend.  Yo",

My 1 year will be July 3.  It was actually the biopsy date but the radiologist was so kind and she was honest.  When I asked her, what do you think, is it cancer, can it be anything else?  She said she was pretty certain it was cancer and the tests would confirm it.  And then she said, but you will be OK now, we will take care of you.  I know they don't usually tell you anything until the tests, but I was relieved to stop trying to think of what else it could be, as well as horrified that it was cancer of course. I am editing this to add that tomorrow is my last radiation treatment!  Yay!! Have a wonderful celebration Jenn!!! Yo",

Hope that gives you some strength.  One foot in front of the other!!!!  Stay srtrong.  Have a great day!",

Annacortes Girl, glad you are getting through as well.  I am on FEC100 x4 (3 week cycles) which is slightly milder than AC (mainly from the cardiotoxicity perspective-still has it but lower %).  Next Thursday will be 3/4, woohoo.  I am lucky, I am finding this a lot easier than the Taxol, no where near as fatigued.  Of course higher risk with WBC's too but they are hanging in OK so far.  Just heard about the radiation-will be 5 1/2 weeks, axilla and boob.  .  darn!!!!  Oh well, it is what it is.  This too shall pass...

Try to be open about the chemo.  Remember it is a key weapon in your arsenal agains this evil BC and is there to make you better.  It is not forever. Not everyone has a bad time with it.  Probably a lot of women who do OK through it don't even come here or write so the info and comments you see is skewed.  Having said that everyone gets through it one way or the other and this site is great for support and true understanding.  (Not trying to preach or anything here, just trying to send you some ideas you can maybe latch onto to help you find a groove.) Comments from people like \"stay positive\" etc etc can start to grate.  Some days you just want to cry and pull the sheets over your head.  What I told my close friends about this was don't tell me to be positive but help me out with some humour because I don't want to cry any more than I need to 'cause it hurts my head!  Easier said than done!  I am blaming my tearfulness on my newly implemented menopause (I am only 44-funny, this is one of the few places I would be considered youngish anymore ) Someone in the August chemo group had a great line so I will use it here.  Get up and walk around your house and imagine you are walking over to Montreal so I can give you a big hug.  And put on your shawl so you will feel wrapped in love.  And perhaps a piece of chocolate taken here, medicinally of course, might help.    {{{Hugs}}} Yo",

Definitely keep looking until you find a doctor that will answer your questions and make you feel confident and that you can trust.  I am pretty new to all this too and started off with a doctor at a clinic who was very abrupt, uncaring and impersonal.  But once I moved on with my diagnosis I have been very fortunate to have had very compassionate and caring medical people taking care of me.  As every one will say and I can recently atest to, you are in the worst, most scary time and a lot of it has to do with being out of control.  Hang in there, line up your questions and see another doctor.  It will get better and you will feel better.  Good luck.",
