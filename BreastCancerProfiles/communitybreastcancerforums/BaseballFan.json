I've been married for 35 years to a great guy.....I was only 19, but knew a good catch when I saw one!  I work in a high school athletic department and he's an engineer. I have mets to bone, lungs and now liver (as of August, 2012) so I'm starting to get a little nervous.  I'm currently on Taxol after recently stopping Xeloda due to H/F syndrome.  I'm not a \"crier\", but since the last progression, find myself close to tears more than I'd like.  The boards are a great source of information and I scour them each day looking for new treatments and success stories.  I pray that the magic bullet comes during our lifetime........",

TMs are starting to rise again because I'm skipping so many G/C treatments.....hoping the addition of Nueulasta shots will do the trick. I was also on Taxol (too slow to respond so switched).

I want to be honest....I am scared and always have those thoughts we all get.....but here's what has happened is the last 12 months. Three people my age...53.... Have died suddenly. Two heart attacks (one man and one woman). The woman collapsed while jogging in our neighborhood. The third woman died of an aneurysm while sitting at her desk at work. All of these friends comforted me when I was diagnosed. I guess my point is that none of know what tomorrow will bring..... I hate this disease and what it has done to my family.

Not sure when I will begin the trial, but I'll keep you posted.  It is an infusion every 3 weeks....with any luck additional centers (closer to home) will be added before I would start.  Baltimore is a 6 hour drive for us....doable, but time-consuming.",

In the paperwork I was given, one time there is an \"L\" and one time they left out the \"L\"....naturally that's what I copied...What the \"L\" is that all about? Sorry...I couldn't resist! That's the closest I ever get to swearing! Anyway....MPDL3280A is a human monoclonal antibody made in a lab. Using MPDL is based on the idea of helping the body 's own natural ability to defend itself by attaching to a molecule called Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1). PDL1 is one of many switches that help control T cell activity to keep them from attacking normal tissues. Some cancers avoid being killed by T cells by expressing PD-L1 on their surface and turning off the T cells trying to attack the tumor. This might allow the T cells to more effectively attack tumors. So, MPDL3280 A is being studied as a way to make T cells more active against Tumors. There are 20 centers participating. Breast cancer is definitely one of the cancers being studied.",

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2013 07:53AM - edited Oct 4, 2013 09:55AM by BaseballFan Hi Lovinmama, I just started Gemzar/Carbo and love it.  After just one cycle (2 treatments), my numbers dropped significantly.  Constipation hit me HARD so ask nurse for recommendations.....and don't make my mistake and wait until it hits....start now.  I've noticed some fatigue so I take a nap when I get home from work and that helps.  I've also had chills a few times right after treatment (a little flu like feeling).  NOTHING to complain about.... So this past Monday, I had the first treatment of the second cycle and haven't had any issues at all.  I can't wait to see TMs after cycle 2 is finished. Good luck, Bobbi",

      "Content": "Oct 28, 2012 11:13PM - edited Oct 28, 2012 11:16PM by BaseballFan So....I went to the Kanzius conference in Erie. It was definitely worth the time and money and my friend and I are definitely going to attend next year. I learned so much....here are some bullet points of things I already knew or learned. - There are a lot of VERY smart people out there...and they want to cure cancer. Dr. Curley said, \"I can help 100 people, but it's the one I can't help is the one that keeps me up at night.\" - Medical presentations were made by three doctors: Dr. Curley (MDA), Dr. Hong Koo Kim, University of Pittsburgh Medical,Center, and Dr. Dustin Kruse, University of California, Davis. - John Kanzius (Erie PA resident, radio engineer and cancer patient) had a theory that a machine could heat cancer cells and destroy them without harming healthy cells. Seems complicated but in reality it is not. - The Kanzius machine can be compared to TV remotes, cell phones, garage door openers...anything that uses radio waves. - These radio waves, at the proper frequencies, can heat metal. If this metal is placed inside a cancer cell and heated, the cancer cell only is destroyed. - Researchers have put this to the test using microscopic metals called nano particles and put them in the patient's bloodstream. This takes about 45 seconds. These particles combine with antibodies and then target and attach themselves to cancer cells. The Kanzius machines generates enough heat to destroy the cancer....with NO side effects. - Researchers have been able to kill cancer cells 100% of the time in small animals. In the last five months the same testing has been conducted on pigs and results are the same. Studies are ongoing and must be validated prior to going to the FDA. They are optimistic that Phase I trials will begin in 2013 at MDA. - Dr. Curley indicated that approximately 15 patients will participate in Phase I so Phase II will follow soon. Those trials will be performed in Erie per John Kanzius' request. - They know it works. What still needs to be determined is what the frequency should be. - They know every cancer is unique so research is ongoing. - They are starting trials with cancers of the pancreas and liver and then will branch out to include other cancers with HER2 positive being a priority. The hope is that as they learn more each day and begin to cure the cancers, the other research will develop much quicker with each success. The video they showed, along with Dr. Curley's presentation, was so inspiring. He truly believes this will be the cure to cancer. But the person who quieted the room was Toni. She has been Stage IV with breast cancer for 6 1/2 years. You know the routine....surgery, meds, 6 different chemo regimens.....and terrible side effects. She did a great job and I hope she sees this post. So....will the cure be tomorrow? No. But I truly believe they are close. Bobbi",
