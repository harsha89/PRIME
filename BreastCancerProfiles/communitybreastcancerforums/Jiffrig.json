But...even before my DMX I had the bioimpedence reading done and wore a sleeve and gauntlet for one month with bi weekly massage as a precaution. Just finished rads and bio indicated no LE and I had 22 lumpy nodes removed! It's a crap shoot, I think as to how your body's lymph system works. But definitely get good therapy to help things along. I asked My BS, after removing 21 healthy nodes, why she took so many and she said some women just have. Abundant amounts and she wanted to get first 2 levels.
