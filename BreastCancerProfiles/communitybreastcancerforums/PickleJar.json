I can see this being more addictive than Facebook.üò¨ Had my bilateral mastectomy on Thursday January 19th (which was also Theophany for those in the Russian Orthodox Church! Anyone, anyone?‚ò∫Ô∏è) Chose No reconstruction, and healing is going well. Still have the drains now 10 days later, follow up appt tomorrow to possibly remove them and also will find out pathology report details :) All I know so far is that margins were clean and there were 3 nodes positive on the right. I see many people have had chemo before surgery, I wonder why my Dr did not do this as he did say the tumor was quite large. I am a relatively new mother, my baby is just 4 months old yesterday. At diagnosis was advised tocold-turkey stop breastfeeding - I think that pain was worse than mastectomy recovery!! ",
