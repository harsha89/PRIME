Let me  start by saying that both men and women on my mothers side of the family have pretty much all had some form of cancer. (More have had cancer than not) I am 32yrs old. Here is whats been going on w/ me. It started about 7/8 months ago I was feeling extremely run down and just plain ill but not like a cold kind of ill. I went to the doc and my white blood count was 25000. Never did figure out why. I just took the anitbotics and they checked it again and it was going down. I went back a few times after and they just seemed disinterested. I have a hard time getting a breath this doesnt happen all the time but quite often. I have been getting a lot of pain on the right upper side under my ribs and then I started getting a sharp shooting pain in the left upper outer portion of my breast and a burning sensation. When the shooting pain started my first reaction was apply preasure to it and that is when i found a lump. Its not really big at all. But my question is if it is cancer would my white blood count be high? I guess the reason I am telling this is because I am wondering if this is how anyone else felt before they were dignosed with breast cancer. Also one other thing I have noticed is there is a brownish liquid that comes out of my other breast. Sometimes it comes out on its own but I can always squeezed it out (I don't do this on a regular basis I just do it to check it sometimes). Thanks ahead of time for any replys I get  Log in to post a reply",
