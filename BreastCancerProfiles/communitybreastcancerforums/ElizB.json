So far ok- felt like I had the flu- had a headache but nothing unmanageable!! Today I feel really good: Bracing myself for the side effects later from rhe Neulesta shot. AST- I had my port put in Monday- I feel it was almost worse then the lumpectomy. But it is fine now. They gave me lidocaine cream to use 1 hour before treatment. No pain today.",

She also said never hesitate to call if you feel you need IV fluids. She said as we continue on we will learn our bodies/reaction will learn our bodies hydration needs and that it is very common get additional IV fluids that week ( 2 liters is almost standard) and she said you will feel amazingly better.

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2018 12:17PM - edited Apr 25, 2018 12:42PM by ElizB Hello! I just read through all the posts Ive missed. Great information and motivation. And I concur - the first day walking into chemo is the terrifying. For nausea: My MO gave me Aloxi and Emend IV before my first treatment. I took the phenergan every four hours for the first for almost 4-5 days for nausea (with drowsiness!) but it kept it down I was not ever nauseous and napped( didn't have to listen to my ears ringing lol). I used Claritin for the bone pain (never had any). Im afraid of my second treatment because Im afraid it won't be as easy. I am really impressed and inspired by how much walking and exercise everyone is getting. I have walked a bit- I think i should try more to keep cardio status ok (with the A/C). GAwarrior- I was so happy to see your post that the tinnitus went away- but sad to see it returned. I honestly think that the fact it stopped for a bit is a great sign. The ENT said \"of course the chemo caused the tinnitus to get worse- it is an assault to your body and your brain and nerve ending react to it\" However could not say which ones caused and offered a few suggestion- B vitamins, noise/music at night (duh) and could try neuropathy meds- which my primary doc could prescribe. Thanks. So my one bright spot is my MD is awesome and met with me- he prescribed Nuerontin at night. He said its very safe and helps the brain cope with the ringing - started last night. I will keep you posted it I get any relief.  Thank you all for sharing all your stories. I read and reread the posts and it helps me so much!",

I have tinnitus - and its driving me crazy!! I think I am seeing this elsewhere on the post as well - GAWarrior? I have talked ( via never-ending calls/ no return etc) with my CNP and MO who basically could care less because Im \"clinically stable and A/C doesn't cause tinnitus\". Period. Honestly I am considering going to a different MO-treatment center if it would even be an option. I spent 2-3 days on the phone and got a ENT appt tomorrow. My main concern is it getting worse next Thurs with next treatment. I am also worried it could be the Neulesta or any of the anti-nausea meds. I am very interested to hear soon ( no pun intended) any one else experience with this. Thanks so much!  I also can't figure out where - how i put in diagnosis",

I did have the headache (loud ringing in ears)and felt so hypersensitive to anything -.I layed around for 5 daysI felt generally lousy. I asked my doctor about the premeds : i had the steroid , Aloxi,Amend (and phenergen after at home.) She got rid of Aloxi ,phenergen and decreased the steroid. She wouldn't touch the chemo just yet... It made a huge difference I felt 100% better than round 1. When I get the Cytoxin IV I feel like the top of my heads going to blow off:(. But it subsides and I take advil I'm sure they can give you something stronger. I'd ask for a pain med if Claritin doesn't work for bone pain-I think the steroids are hell too. Maybe they could give you a little more IV fluids ( esp with your bp)I really pleaded my case- nurse got the pharmacist involved. I had no nausea even getting rid of 2 meds. Zofran alone worked. I'm on th A/C now x 4. Talk to your chemo nurse and MO- be persistent. You shouldn't have to go through that. Round two should be easier. To summarize my scattered response! Ask about the steroid and side meds - maybe decrease a bit Pain med for bone pain A little extra hydration ( help your bp and pain) Prayers to you - keep us posted Betsy",

I hate to hear about all these bad side effects:( Frog and I seem to be the only ones with tinnitus. My regular doctor is letting me try Neurontin for it- actually more to see if it will calm my brains reaction to it. Thanks for asking- Frog I will let you know if It works!! He said its a very safe drug- minimal SE and may be helpful during chemo.",
