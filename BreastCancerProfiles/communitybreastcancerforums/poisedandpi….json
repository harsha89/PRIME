My eyebrows and eyelashes stayed until I was completely finished with chemo then they started to fall out. I never full lost all of my brows or the outer corner eyelashes. I'm a little over 4 weeks post in my final chemo. I'm starting to see tiny eyelashes and eyebrows growing back. No new growth from my hair on my head, but what didn't fall out - really random strands scattered all over my scalp is growing decently long.",

Comparing myself to others on Instagram, I think my expectations of regrowth were way off base. My hair on my head is what\u2019s left that didn\u2019t fall out. Same with my brows and lashes. I have zero new growth. How long did it it take before you could see new growth? When I was looking at other women\u2019s pics on Instagram it just seems like everyone is farther along than me by one month out.  I\u2019d also like to strongly caution anyone with green eyes using Latisse. The brown you see in my eyes is from using Latisse when I was desperate to see new eyelashes again. I didn\u2019t have brown in my iris before at all before using it. So that\u2019s also been tough to realize I\u2019ve now permanently changed my eye color. I\u2019m just all around feeling really frustrated and want to look like me again.",

The length will depend on if I can get into the trial for Proton Therapy or not. I'm doing monthly injections of Lupron. I've started Tamoxifen and I will be doing six months of Xeloda. Magnolia, my oncologist felt I still needed to do the six months of Xeloda to be preventative in addition the hormone therapy.",

I think my expectation was off base by thinking the tumor would just 100% completely disappear and that I was done with treatment. I think I was maybe too optimistic about my treatment plan. For some reason I just assumed that was typically the expected result. Since my tumor was shirking so much in size - it could no longer even be felt before surgery - my team only mentioned hormone therapy to me not more chemo post surgery. That is what really threw me for a loop. Trishyla, that's the sentiment that my breast surgeon had as well about my lymph nodes I feel confident in my plan to do just do radiation to treat them given the amount was so small the microscope missed it even the first thing when they tested during surgery. I'll find out more about the type of additional chemo next week when I meet with oncologist.",
