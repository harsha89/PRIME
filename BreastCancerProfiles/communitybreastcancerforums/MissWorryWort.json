    "Content": "MissWorryWort wrote: hello everyone. This is my first post. I found a weird dimple like thing during a self breast exam. I went to a breast specialist that referred me to have a mammogram and US. I have done that and now I will be having a core biopsy this Thursday. The radiologist said she is pretty sure sure it's nothing and I could wait 6 months if I wanted but I have health anxiety and panic attacks so I opted for the biopsy right away. I got a BIRADS 4 on the report. I am so scared of pain with the biopsy and mostly scared I will get a bad result. Thank you for any info you can give me. I have had 3 surgical breast biopsies in the past. Started when I was 15 y.o. I am now 41. Any info is appreciated Log in to post a reply",
