I was originally diagnosed October, 1999, Stage IIB. I was 38. I am married and I have 7 children, at the time aged G-18, G-16, B-14, B-10, G-6, twin Gs-5. Mastectomy, lymph nodes (13 removed, 1 positive) chemo, reconstruction and five years of Tamoxifan. After my 5 year mark, my onc told me I was \"cured\" and had nothing to worry about. In March of 2007, I had a cough that wouldn't go away. My Family doc sent me for an xray and diagnosed pneumonia. After a course of antibiotics made no difference, I was sent for a CT scan. Two hours later I received a phone call telling me I had to come in to the doctor right away. I had breast cancer in my lungs, all over both lungs, 3 measurable masses and spots \"like shattered glass\" and a pleural effusion. I was referred to an oncologist (my former was in a different \"network\") who told me I had 2-3 years to live and to quit my job as I would no longer be able to work. Lucky for me, the nurses at the clinic told me I needed to transfer to one of the other doctors. I started chemo right away, inÂ  April, Carboplatin & Taxotere. In May they added Herceptin and Lupron, and daily Femara. I had that combo through July 2007, then the chemo portion was dropped. In March of 2008, I returned to work. My cancer was stable until November 2011 when one of the spots they had been measuring started growing. I was scheduled for an RFA to try and remove it. They were unable to get it all so I was being followed closely by PET CT. Since then, I was switched to Aromasin and then Faslodex. Then cancer had spread into my body cavity by September, 2012, with lots of active nodes and new spot on my liver. Wait and see until the scan in November showed liver spot more than doubled and there was now \"cancerous activity\" within the pleural effusion, and other \"activity\" in my lungs. Last Monday, Jan 21st, I started Perjetta, Herceptin, Taxotere. I sure hope I end up on the good side of the statistics for this combination. So far the side effects aren't too bad. Not thrilled to gain 7lbs in 2 days, though, lol. I would like to hear from others on this combo. Lori",

For one thing, my medical insurance through my employer. My SSDI is only $1066 a month. I'm afraid between the cost of Medicare and the copays, there wouldn't be much left. I could actually keep my insurance up to a year as long as I pay my share (almost $400). I know I can work part time; I did the last couple months. Frankly, staying under $1040 earnings a month isn't easy! Unfortunately, my position really requires more time than that. The issue now is that I am always sick. I always have a fever and liver pain and it is getting worse. I was on disability after my original diagnosis in 2007 for a year. I know deep down that is most likely the route I will be forced to take. It is all happening so fast. I guess I just wasn't ready.",

The first scan after 3 treatments was incredibly good. 3 months later, it is back with a vengance. At least 10 more lesions in my liver, previously 1; moderate pleural effusion in lungs, causing a blockage, etc. I start TDM1 on Monday. I will be so happy to be off the taxotere, although I would have preferred a less dramatic reason! I understand the side effects are significantly less severe on TDM1.",

My blood counts were good so I got treatment and seemed to tolerate it fine. I can't really speak to side effects because I ended up having a fever for 4 days so can't say what caused what! In any case, I went to have the fluid drained off my lung yesterday. When they did the ultrasound to figure out where to insert the needle, they discovered the pleural effusion had almost totally disappeared! There wasn't enough left to drain! That is 4 DAYS after my first treatment! I am very optomistic for a good response to this treatment. After my last PET, I really believed I was going to have to consider my end of life choices, I had so much spread and activity increase. I am so happy!",

Well, except that it appears only to be working in my lungs and not my liver. I have had a fever steadily for 6 weeks now and after many tests, all with negative results, my doc believes it is caused by the liver mets. I also have severe pain in the liver area. I am on a mass amount of pain killers just to deal with it and I have to take Advil continually to keep my fever at a managable level. I have a PET scheduled for Thursday, but I guarantee my liver is way worse. This is all happening so fast. I think I may have to take a leave of abscence from my job. I was on vacation last week and that is when the pain and fever started increasing. I don't know how/if I am going to be able to function at work next week. I feel like my whole world is crashing around me.",

I thought I was so tired and short of breath from my treatment, but the doc says the pleural effusion is blocking half of my right lung, so, yes, it can certainly be the cause of your shortness of breath. I was told I could have it drained and that would restore lung function for awhile. I am seriously considering it. It sucks being out of breath from walking up my driveway 15 feet! Lori",
