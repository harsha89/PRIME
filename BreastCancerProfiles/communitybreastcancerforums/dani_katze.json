I ask this because, my radiologist told me my energy would come back after a month, and it's been more than 3 months for me now... MTwomen, Thanks for your advice. I was thinking the same, to try another psychiatrist... It's just that I tried so many. For instance, after my first mastectomy, I found a good one and I was on medicin for depression for about 2 years and he told me I was recovered from my depression, although I visited him three times after leaving medicin, telling him I didn't feel ok. So, I tried a new psychiatrist, when I felt stressed about work and went back to and medicin again. Then I looked for another one, for a better diagnosis for my mood disorder, but she told me that she never saw me depressed.... So I returned to the previous physician and he told me to go back only if I still feel awful after a month without medicin ... So I am thinking to wait for a month without medicin or to look for another psychiatrist...",

Through surgery, on march this year, the nodule was removed and afterwards, on july, I had 25 sessiones of radiation. The doctor told me that I would feel tired and depressed. Well, I am always struggling with tiredness and depression, after my first thyroid cancer in 1992. In fact, after my thyroid glandule was removed, I changed a lot, my energy was never the same and had the worst depression ever. But I got used to, and had good and bad moments... But, lately, I feel depressed as I used to feel back in 1992 and don't know if this is due radiation or what... I was on antidepressant, but because one of the side effects (migraines) were so strong, that I decided to quit, but very slow. I went to the pyshiatrist and he told me I was right for doing so and if I feel too much depression, I have to go back to him to try another medicin. Anyway, I wouldn't go back to him, he was really different, he hardly listen and cared about what I wanted to tell him... I don't know what to do... I just don't have any energy and feel that I have lost interest in thingd I used to enjoy, like doing excirse. Lately, for weekends I hardly go out, don't want to do anything, but sleep... Any insight are welcome!

      "Content": "dani_katze wrote: I had a mastectomy of my left breast on august last year and on december the reconstruction surgery. I didn't have to undergo neither quimio nor radiotherapy. But my doc said that I have to take tamoxifen for 5 years to avoid another breast cancer. Therefore, I write you because I am concerned about tamoxifen's side effects, like headaches, because before cancer, for many year I suffered from headaches that got worst in intensity and frecuency, due contraceptive I used to take for acne problems. I left the contraceptives and went to see a doc and he sent me for brain exam (magnetic resonance imaging) and he found some brain angiomas. He was kind of surprised by this because he said I was too young to have this. But I didn't continue seeing him because as soon as I left contraceptives I didn't have any migraines anymore. But now that I began with tamoxifen I realized that headaches started again and are getting worse... so I am afraid of this and also of the side effects like thrombosis or uterus cancer.Â  I will talk with my doc about this, but I wonder if anyone of you stop using tamoxifen and try to control cancer by an alternative way.
