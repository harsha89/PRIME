SO, going on my former doctor;s advice I knew a mammogram was coming when I turned 33. That made me nervous enough since I turned 30 this year. After describing a thickness in my breast to my current doctor she explained that we should definitely start at 35 since it is rare in younger women. She thought she would humor me and ease my fears by sending me for a mammogram. 5 weeks, later I've had 2 biopsies, diagnosed with LCIS and am waiting for treatment.  ",

Now add in family history (my mother and aunt). I was tryingto put this behind me too. I knew I would freak out just before my 3 month follow-up (physical-today). Now I'm really fraking out because I'm having a mammo and ultrasound tomorrow. I know this will always be a monkey on my back. Do some more research. Stage 0 isn't even considered a cancer....So why am I dealing with this?",

I'm still waiting on a second opinion, MRI and BRAC test even though I've pretty much made up my mind about the Tamoxifen. All of these things are coming up in the next 2 weeks and I am starting to lose it. I'm super stressed about it and everything else in my life. I feel it's starting to take a real toll on my life as much as I try not to have it take over. Does anyone know of any support groups in the Malden, Ma area? ",

I know what you mean by being on a roller coaster. I went in for a Mammogram and ultrsound one day and before I knew it I was getting ready for a biopsy that same day. The fact that it was even found happened because my doctor thought I was paranoid. The 3 days that followed were the longest. I decided to only read enough to be informed for what the suspisions were. I knew that if I continued to read it would only drive me crazy and I still had to get on with my life and get through the week. My doctor then called and said \"everything is fine, no cancer\". The next day she called back and said \"sorry, there was a mistake. I didn't read the entire report\" I have since had the lump taken out and am trying to figure out my treatment options. Since being diagnosed I have decided to educate myself as much as possible on the subject and do what I can to lower my risk.  Being proactive about everything. Setting up my own appointments not waiting for the doctor to do it. ",
