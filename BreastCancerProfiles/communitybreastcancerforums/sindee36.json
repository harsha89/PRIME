I told my Mom today-I couldn't take it and she was so calming and reasurring and i know that she and my Dad will be praying for me and the outcome.   I am at peace with whatever that outcome is right now-the waiting and wondering what it actually is is consuming me though.",

On March 31st I went in for a mammogram, I am 36 and my last one was Feb. 2009.  My older sister was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer (Inflammatory and Infiltrating) at the age of 42-so I started getting checked early.  My sister is a survivor-thank God!! We just celebrated her 50th in October!!!!!  :) In 2009 my results came back normal, the breast specialist did tell me she saw some calcifications and I had very dense breasts-she told me to come back in 6 months but I got pregnant not too long after that, so I was not able to go back until last month.  Fast forward to today-I got the results of my most recent mammogram and it says there are some undetermined findings and that I need further testing.  That made my heart sink.  Before my sister was diagnosed they had watched her every six months for 2 years and she was told they were calcifications. I also had a biopsy in 2005 for what turned out to be intraductal papillomas. Can anyone give me any advice as to what happens next and what kinds of tests they do?  If you have gone through this what was the outcome?  Any advice is much appreciated!  :)   Our family has gone through so much with my sisters diagnosis that I don't want to burden them with any questions or concerns. Thank you for listening! Cindy Edited to add: My sister was never offered a biopsy during those 2 years which has been a cause of great pain to her because she felt it could have been diagnosed sooner.
