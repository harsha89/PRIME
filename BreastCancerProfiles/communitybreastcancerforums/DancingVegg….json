I have since had continuous low grade fevers (99.5) and I can totally feel my liver mets from the inside and the outside.  If I don't take two ibuprofen a day, I am miserable.  I took an extra week off to take my son to Camp Kesem (if you have children, you should check out this free camp for children of parents with cancer) and I have scheduled scans for this Monday.  I think I'll be asking for Abraxane.  I don't want to deal with steroid face if I can help it.   Peace out (most likely).",
