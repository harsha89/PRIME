      "Content": "Staceyatmiss wrote: Hello everyone, Here is my story! Months ago I was about to step into the shower and noticed one of my breast like i had hit it on something or ran into something (I had not) I though nothing of it and seemed to settle but then a week later a horrible searing sting hit that breast, again thought it pass, it kept coming through out the day and persisted, on top of that i became aware of other this happening on that side, odd elbow ache, a shoulder blade sting and a very odd underarm pain/pinching feeling. It all comes it waves sort of. The breast in question is a tad tender to. I was sent to breast specialist who has done two ultrasounds and order ct scan, clear and ulrasoumd was bi rads neg so nothing. She did however find a soft lumpy area on the outer breast but said was fine. She wanted to be super safe and ordered an MRI in a few weeks. I want to believe my good results so far. But I have come across so many storys now of woman who had had these exact same pain/symptoms that eventually lead to there diagnosis! That pain I feel is nothing like I ever felt and none of seems to shift. It's the same wacko pain and sting each day. My gut is telling me this not right! But I want to trust two clear ultrasounds. I do have very dense breast and fairly young. Log in to post a reply",
