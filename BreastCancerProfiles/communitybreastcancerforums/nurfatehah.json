It lasted for over a month, got smaller day by day and now I can only see dark scar of it. But, I also experience swollen armpit. Its not like a hard small lump but looks like fat or more tissue that thicker on the same armpit. The armpit got so itchy sometimes, I got some rash too. But the rash is gone now, only the swelling remains. Does anyone with breast cancer experienced the same thing before you got diagnosed? Thank you Log in to post a reply",

Its not like a lump but like a vein that move around under your skin, but it is deep inside my armpit, its a size of a marble and move around and kind of 'run' around hahah I don't know how to explain this so I guess it is a knot. Emm, my question is, is this a sign of breast cancer? and does anyone who experienced the same thing got diagnosed with breast cancer here? Log in to post a reply",
