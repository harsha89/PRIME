It's a scary experience and can be frustrating, difficult and discouraging, but you will get through it. I couldn't imagine making it to the end of chemo, much less actually getting to a year out. But it does happen! And, best of all, I just had a PET/CT scan last week and there was no sign of cancer. I am sooo thankful. Be sure and read the tips for getting through and I would suggest going ahead and getting all the supplies that are suggested. I didn't need all of them, but it was nice already having on hand what I did need. Almost any question you have can be answered on these boards, so don't hesitate to ask. I hope you do well and your side effects are minimal. Best of luck to you. Kathy",

Guess there has to be at least one perk from chemo! I haven't had any cuts yet to style it, but I have discovered that if I don't put gel on it after washing, it dries straight up!! I seriously look like a poodle (especially with the white/gray hair). One of these days I'll figure out how to post a pic. Kathy",

My hair is coming back in wavy/curly and going in every possible direction! I'm thrilled to have hair - but what on earth do you do with it at this stage? The hair on my neck and sideburns is starting to show with my wig on, so I'm thinking about going 'commando' because I don't want to buy another wig at this point. But it doesn't look or act anything like my (real, regular, old - don't know what adjective to use) hair. Should I schedule a hair appointment just to find out what to do with it?? Kathy",
