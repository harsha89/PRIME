I'm not one who likes to be poked on and can be quite the weenie about getting an IV. So I thought a port would be a good thing for me. I also know that I didn't care much for my drain either. So how are they to care for? Do they make things sore in the area? Any special concerns with bathing?

I myself have been very calm, I know that God is in control. I moved over 600 miles from friends and family 2 1/2 years ago. So even the Doctors have all been new to me.  I feel a peace about all the medical personal I have been involved with thus far. I know God has placed me in good hands. My biggest concerns come from not knowing what is next. So it is a great help to come here and read all the stories from others who have been down the path before me.

I just don't have any energy, I don't start chemo until the 7th and I need the energy to get stuff done. I bought a cute pink canvas tote bag to carry all my stuff in. The Onc gave me a 3 ring binder that has alot to it. Tabs for the different topics we go over...ie: Medications & side effects, Insurance, Treatment Plan, Health & Nutrition, Beauty Care, and My Progress. A calender to let me know of up coming events in my area about bc. I will also keep a book to read, puzzle book, snacks, chap stick, water bottle, gum, IPod. Anything I think I may need while at the Onc office for treatment. I also got the power port. Not at all what I thought it would be, but it will be alot less to care for. My Mom had to do her own flushes with the port she had, the Onc office will take care of all that for me. I am still sore for having it put in. My lump and snb is on my right side. I still can't stretch out my arm like before. The Surgeon had to cut a nerve to get to the nodes, so I will always be numb in my armpit area. The port is on my left, and now I'm sore on both sides. Another thing the Onc has me on Calcium & Vit D. He said Chemo is hard on your bones. I'm also er+ pr+ so my treatment will hinder the estrogen that other parts of my body need.  Well I'm pooped, I'll chat more later. Krista",

Shaved my head last week so I'm sporting a new wig. My Daughter was there to watch. I think it helped her to see, she was so worried about me loosing my hair. Kim- I pray that all goes well with you today and you get through your first tx with few or no side effects. Take your meds, rest when you need to rest, even if it means asking those well meaning helpers to visit another day. Aurora- Thank you for all your advice, concerns and warm wishes. God has blessed your Husband with a wonderful woman and his children with a loving & caring Mother. Patricia- Glad to hear you had a great outing with friends, and to be hit on to boot...woohoo!! For the rest of you ladies thank you for your stories. They encourage me, make me laugh, and just bring me hope. Krista",

It effects each one of us differently. Hair loss is one of the outward signs that we are dealing with cancer, and it causes others to look at us like we're pitiful at times. So keep your chin up, cause we're kicking cancer's butt. I just received a t-shirt from a co-worker that stated: Fighting Like a Girl, in pink letters with pink boxing gloves and the pink bc ribbon.
