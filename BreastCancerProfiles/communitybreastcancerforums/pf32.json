Purchasing bras was difficult prior to cancer and surgery - I'm very intimidated to walk into a regular store (i.e. Victoria's Secret and dealing w/ young sales girls who really won't be able to provide guidance).  Any recommendations or advice? P.S. If anyone from the post-treatment chat room reads this (earlier this evening I tried to pose the question to those in post-treatment) --- I couldn't type in - not sure what the problem was. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
