Peggy that is a busy household but I am sure you are just eating up your grandkids.  It is good therapy, keeps your mind on positive things.  With going back to work comes running for my daughter's dance lessons and her ice skating team.  It will be great to do all of it this year feeling good.  Glad you guys are doing well. ",
