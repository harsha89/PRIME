Well, I had my BMX and TUG on the 5th of April.  I was in surgery and recovery for 22 hours because I had a hematoma in one of my thighs.  I was surprised that I only needed over-the-counter pain medication other than for a sore throat which I had because I had a gastric tube inserted through the surgery and for the following day or so.  I was given oxynorm - an opiate - for the throat pain. I started standing and sitting up on Day 3 post-op although the first time I stood up I fainted.  I was home on Day 6 post-op.  The only other complication I had in the hospital was tacycardia - a high pulse rate - which they monitored to ensure I wasn't having a blood clot. I had a lot of energy and walked around the house, up and down the stairs, quite a lot on Day 6 and 7.  Day 8 now I'm having some breast pain and am sore so think I will try to rest a bit more today. I opted for reconstruction and I love my new breasts.  They are truly beautiful aside from the stitches and bruising.  My DH is thrilled too.  I did have some moments of tears this morning with some pain I was having but my DH calmed me down. Onwards and upwards!  I hope everyone is coping okay. ",

I was told that I could not have any further radiation by my breast surgeon at my first consult this past February.  The plan for me was that I could either have lumpectomy or one or both mastectomies with recon.  I chose mastectomies because of the high risk to develop cancer due to the radiation damage 17 years ago.  The chemo was only as a mop-up for any micrometastises in my lymph nodes that were left. I would have thought that if you decided to, you could now go on to having a mastectomy or mastectomies with recon - are you considering this?  I know it's scary - it was for me but I did not want to risk losing more years with a further breast cancer - I also had a fibroadenoma in my \"other\" (the non-cancerous) breast. I remember my doctors saying I had the best cancer you could get back in 1994 but at that time, they did not know that the treatment for Hodgkins would have been so high risk for breast cancer.  Since about 2003, here in the UK it is mandatory to screen all Hodgkins patients using a triple assessment (mammo, ultrasound, biopsy).  I was never contacted about this even though my GP was supposed to have contacted me!!!!  What can I do now?  It's in the past and I cannot undo it.  I intend to fight for my life in the only way I know how to.  My anger is leaving slowly but I now speak up when I think the doctors aren't taking care of me properly. I'm sorry you are hurting and frustrated and worried.  It's best to get it all out in the open and air your feelings when you need to.  We're here for you and I hope you feel you can use this forum to air your thoughts and share your ideas.",

I would drive over 60 miles to my plastic surgeon's office only to be told (for the 3rd or 4th time) that he wasn't in and someone else would see me.  But that someone else couldn't help me!   Michelle, I also found that my GP was not aware of everything - he had information on his computer but it was all over the place!!!!!  At my local hospital here in Suffolk I saw someone at our cancer information centre and they helped me prepare a care plan which included all of the information that any doctor or nurse or whatever would need. I suggest you prepare something like that for yourself.  All your medical information is as concise manner as possible.  Don't assume that anyone you see has the information you need.  Do your own research.  Ask questions when you are there.  Read from your script (your care plan) if you need to in an appointment - give a copy to the consultant or registrar.  Tell them when you are unhappy with their carelessly given \"opinion\".  Perhaps it will have an impact on future care in that clinic or at that hospital. Really, I think some of our NHS staff are so overworked they forget they are dealing with human beings. Also, there should be a MacMillan nurse at your hospital - see if there is.  If not, then yes, the breast care specialists will help you.  I highly recommend contacting Macmillan. Deborah, I had a MUGA scan (twice) to check heart function.  Also, a few EKG's and a couple of echocardiograms.  Also, I wore a heart beat monitor for 24 hours to record my heart beats.  As for lung function - there are several available - one of them records your function as you sit in an enclosed machine - it was many years ago I had this so I can't remember the name of it.  Based on your symptoms your doctor will suggest tests but you should discuss using other diagnostic tests if you are unhappy with the first results that come in.",

I decided my inner thighs and gracilis muscles there.  I have a separate thread running on this forum - if you search \"TUG\" reconstruction you should find it - it documents my progress.  Others on this side have threads on the DIEP reconstruction (tummy) and latimus dorsi (sp?). As to your surgeon for the mastectomies/reconstruction - you are allowed to ask them (and they must answer you) how many of these surgeries they have done, how many were successful, how many unsuccessful, what are the complications - find out who will be doing your surgery as sometimes their assistants do the surgery not them. As to being positive, thank you, I try to relax and always think to the future when I'll be feeling better.  It seems to help my stomach nausea and stress - I try to relax my body and it relaxes my mind and I can respond to my issues in a more positive way. That's just my strength - when I was in the hospital - I spent time with all the other patients in my room (6 of us here in the UK) to chat with them and relax them a bit. You have so much to life for with your family.  You will get through to the other side of all this stress and anguish soon.  Think of your future and have some goals to work towards.  Mine is to learn to ride the motorbike I bought last March - something I've wanted to do since I was a young teen.",

Yes, I remember my surgeons saying the radiated skin was what they worried about in reconstruction.  By the way, my breasts using my thigh tissue ache daily especially at the end of the day - no matter which bra I use - the surgical support or a regular bra (or even none). As to rads, my oncologist said the dose I had would matter most and my rad dose had been quite high so they wouldn't do rads (over 5,000 when they coned down to the lymphoma itself).",

I had radiation to my entire upper mantel from my belly up so they could not do a DIEP reconstruction on me.  They would not use radiated skin to reconstruct.  However, they did keep my breast skin as my BC hadn't spread to my skin.  My TUG reconstruction did leave large scars on my thighs because of infection and seroma problems but hopefully these will calm down or I'll be having more surgery.  I've seen other women's scars 4 months and 1 year post-op and their thighs looked much better than are looking but I think my thigh healing is not complete.

There is a forum entitled \"Surgery, Before and After\" on this site and there are threads that discuss the DIEP procedure from Ladies who've had it.  I was originally going to have the DIEP until my plastic surgeon found out how much radiation I had to my stomach.  That's why I chose the TUG using my thighs.  Here in England they have support groups at some of the hospitals where Ladies who've had the surgery show their scars/results to those who are waiting to have theirs.  I was so impressed with the results I saw on other Ladies that I knew I wanted the TUG. Once I knew what I wanted, I just tried to keep calm and prepare myself for the surgery.  Afterwards, I just did everything the surgeons told me and focused myself on the future when I wouldn't be so uncomfortable.  By the way, I never needed more than over-the-counter pain meds after surgery.  I was never in very much pain, just uncomfortable.  But they will give you whatever drugs you need so you are not in pain.",

It's a difficult decision, Eli, and I hope you are able to make the right one for you.  Good luck and let us know how you get on. Following diagnosis, I had a right breast mastectomy and left breast prophylactic mastectomy.",

When I was diagnosed with BC in my right breast in February of last year, my breast surgeon said that because of my Hodgkins treatment a prophylactic mastectomy on my left breast would be recommended.  I'm glad I had both breasts removed and I decided on immediate reconstruction using my thigh tissue.  My decision was influenced by the thought of having both breasts more like each other. I wouldn't have had a prophylatic mastectomy based on my risk as it was explained to me in 1994.  I wasn't aware of the increased risks until I found the lump recently.  But if I was BRCA and knew of that I would have had prophylactic mastectomy. Does that make sense?  Oh well . . . it makes sense to me :)",

SurfaGrl, I'm on tamoxifen because I was pre-menopausal before breast cancer.  There are lots of threads on Armidex on this forum though so search for some great information. I'm not pleased that I have to take tamoxifen and deal with the side effects but I feel I have no choice given my history and the Grade of my IDC.  I'm having less noticeable side effects 5 months after starting tami though. Today I'm having a 24hour tape fitted to record my heart rate as in the past few years I've had a rapid heart beat.  Can't ever get it below 90 and mostly it's 100 to 120.  Hopefully it's nothing serious but it will be good to rule anything out. Oh yeah, SurfaGrl, just my experience but I'm glad I had the prophylactic on my left side.  My breasts are evenly matched now.  They actually look better than they did prior to BMX.  One side effect to consider though is numbness. From what my PS says, it is rare for feeling in the reconstructed breast to return.  Although this bothered me at first I now accept it.  I did have the TUG reconstruction though so perhaps the DIEP is different.  Ask your surgeon.",

BMX was recommendation to me because of prior radiation to my mantle.  My stomach was also radiated so the reconstruction breast material could only come from my bum or thighs.  My breasts were reconstructed using my thigh tissue including the gracilis muscle. I was also offered a lumpectomy but I read so much information on Hodgkins survivors who had BC, then lumpectomy and then another lump was found a year or so later - I thought I would just get it over with and have both removed.  I did have some lumps in my other unbiopsied breast that needed to be looked at and they all turned out to be benign.  So they considered my left MX to be prophylatic.  I'm happy their gone as I don't worry so much now.

I was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Micropapillary Carcinoma which is a fairly rare and aggressive form of IDC.  It's spread to some lymph nodes and I'll be having FEC-T chemo starting the 9th of May.  One of the problems with the \"E\" part of the chemo cocktail  in the \"FEC\" is that it might damage the heart so this is something to consider, certainly with your heart condition history, and also with Hodgkins survivors.  I'll be having a heart scan or test (can't remember what they call it) to ensure I can tolerate it. Good luck with your decision and I hope you can remain positive and strong.  I had a good cry last week though and it felt good just to let it all out and then I moved on.",

I'm told by my breast surgeons that they still don't have enough information on survival rates or similar stats for long-term Hodgkins survivors but that I should take the tamoxifen to increase my changes of remaining NED.  I was 100% estrogen positive and so tamoxifen was recommended especially in this instance.  Debs, you are so right.  Mastectomy is a personal decision.  It was given to me as only one of my choices - my surgeons were okay with me having a lumpectomy if that was my decision. They didn't push me one way or the other.  They explained all the options to me.  The only strong opinion they had for going forward was that I could not have any further radiation as I had my \"maximum lifetime dose\" in 1995. Hi Kle and you are so right - a cardiologist is a must.  I had a cardiology workup with an echocardiogram back in 1998 and again a few weeks ago.  My team of BC doctors did not suggest a cardiologist to me - I had to insist on it myself knowing the risks.    I'd also recommend having your thyroid checked (mine is low and caused by radiation).   Also, reflux disease can be caused by radiation to the stomach or esophagus and if you have this it is essential to be on medication (such as previcid).  There is a risk that constant reflux left untreated could cause an oral or esophageal cancer.   Please post any and all information you find in your research and experience.  It is so helpful to us and also a great reminder about taking care to ensure we are on the right track. ",

Heart irregularity question:  I've been having a high resting heart rate (100-120) and have had EKG and Echocardiograms but nothing terrible is revealed although I'm told I have a bicuspid valve and a heart murmer. I was told about the heart murmur sometime before my Hodgkins diagnoses so that's not a result of treatment.  I'm having some chest pain but it's not pressure - it's intermittent pain lasting only a few seconds.  Blood pressure normal.  My GP is sending me for another EKG (ECG).  It's been almost 20 years since my Hodgkins treatment in 1995 and I didnt have chemo at the time - only high dose mantle radiation (over 5000 rads coned down over my chest area - where my breast lump was found in 2011).  Are there questions I should be asking about my heart?  Should I have any particular tests to check valve damage?  Thanks!  ",

I had a core biopsy and they only put the needle in twice.  They found cancer cells in the lump (right breast) which is between 1 and 2 centimetres but are unsure what type as of yet.  There is another suspicious lump in my right breast and I also have smaller lumps in my left breast that have not been biopsied.  My BC recommends bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction because of the likelihood that the lumps are cancerous after past radiation treatment.  Also, they will not radiate the area again.  After doing some research, I agree with this approach and should be having the procedure in the next few weeks (awaiting a date). I won't know my type, stage and grade until the breast tissue is biopsied.  Oh, I'm also having an auxilliary node dissection, 4 or 5 on each side. I saw my microsurgeon this week and he won't do a DIEP recon because my stomach just below my belly button was radiated so he has recommended a TUG where they take fat and muscle from the inner thighs.  This is a procedure that they are doing more and more of in Europe as it was pioneered in Austria.  I researched my surgeon and the procedure and I feel that this is the way for me to go. I think what has surprised me is that they are doing a skin saving mastectomy so are only taking the areola and nipple skin (along with the tissue inside).  I guess with the radiation damage to my breasts I thought they would take all of the tissue.  Ladies, how much tissue did they take from your breast(s)? I know I can fight this and I've got a very positive attitude, however, I like to be informed.  Oh, and of course, I am a little frightened of the surgery and the waking up just after.",

I was given the choices of lumpectomy or single (of right breast) or double mastectomy.  My decision was based on the fact that the lump had been there the year previously and despite a fine needle biopsy wasn't diagnosed.  It was also based on the fact that micropapillary cells were found, which are considered more aggressive.  During my ultrasound it was obvious that something was also going on in the lymph nodes under my arm.  I also had a few lumps in my left breast and although it was felt these were only fibroadenomas I felt more comfortable having my left breast taken as well even if it would be prophylactic, which it was. In part, I also based my decision on having an immediate reconstruction using my own tissue so that there would be some symmetry between both breasts.   I was 49 at the time of diagnosis and in a new relationship so I felt BMX was my best option.  Saying that, I do not have any feeling in my newly reconstructed breasts.  That is definately something to consider.   I'm okay with my decision but it wouldn't be everyone's choice.  Debs, I'm sorry you are here with us but there is a lot of great information on this site and in this forum to help you make the right decision for you. Best wishes for a clear head! ",

My reconstruction material came from my inner thighs and gracilis muscle.  I did not heal quickly either in my breast area or in my thighs.  However, one year post-op my scars look so much better. My breasts look good and friends tell me they wish their's looked like mine.   I was in surgery about 16-18 hours.  I spend some of this time in recovery and had to return to the operating theatre because of a hematoma in one of my thighs.  I did well otherwise. My recovery was a long process.  I had a lot of infections in my thighs and recurrent swelling (seromas).  I did not get any breast infections.  I started chemo six weeks post-BMX and reconstruction.  Post-chemo, September 2011, I was still having problems with swelling and infection in my thighs.  These problems have resolved now and I am happy with what I see in the mirror. I wish you well and a smooth journey. ",

The TUG reconstruction is where they take the fat, muscle and skin from the inner thighs to shape the breast and nipple into a cone.  The incision is usually made around the areola and the areola and nipple removed.  A nipple is shaped immediately from the thigh tissue.  So, I get a thigh tuck.  Conveniently, my thighs are my largest asset.  :-) Good luck Kezzie and SweetJolie!!!!!

I stopped taking tamoxifen in October after taking it for 2 years. I was having so many aches and pains and hot flushes - and I wanted a vacation. Finally went to see my breast cancer specialist at the hospital and she ordered some blood tests to see what my hormone levels were like - whether or not I was in menopause. The blood tests came back abnormal in that some of the results were saying I wasn't yet in menopause and some results saying that I was. She said she would consult with my oncologist and see where we go from here. My specialist told me that I would have to go back on an anti-estrogen of some kind and that would depend on whether I was pre or post menopause. In the meantime, she's giving me acupuncture and acupressure for the hot flushes. Well, in the past few weeks I've had various viruses which resulted in ear and sinus infections (not like I've ever had before) and I'm having constant pain in my neck. My specialist felt my neck glands and approved me seeing a chiropractor and sports masseuse to help ease my neck pain. It slightly worked and now I'm in pain again. Yesterday, rather weirdly, I started having constant breast pain in the breast that had the grade 3 cancer in with 3 positive nodes. Well, this breast was reconstructed. Is this fantom pain? Or a possible recurrence? I'm also super tired but if I spend too much time in bed, I hurt worse. I guess I'm worried about relapse or mets. I wish I could just put all of this behind me. Really, I don't want to feel like this and I have tried to be \"positive\" but I can't help thinking the worst. Anyway, I could use some support and some advice. Thanks in advance.

Kicks, yes, I've been hearing a lot about vitamin D and have been thinking of adding D3 to my diet. I'll get my levels checked first though. I do have a light box for the mornings over breakfast and our alarm clock is a light that imitates sunrise by slowing getting brighter and brighter. OK, I'm feeling much more positive. I'm done \"rolling around\" in it and ready to move on. Thanks girls. Hugs to you all.",

I have the unreachable deep itching and I have to hold my reconstructed breasts to stop it - itching doesn't help. It's the holding - sometimes pressing my arms into my chest, like you say, discretely, if I'm out in public. The worst is when I'm trying to go off to sleep at night but I am managing. Relaxation, massage and meditation help me. Also, biofeedback, I think it's called. The feeling is almost always there but I've taught myself not to focus on it.",

I do a meditation that involves scanning through my body parts from head to toe to notice tension and I try to relax that tension. Sometimes it takes a few minutes on body parts such as my breasts or my jaw. It gets easier with practice. I also use self-hypnosis tapes. I've tried many different tapes - the important thing is to find someone you enjoy listening to. I find a man's voice more relaxing. I usually listen to tapes that are for relaxation, anxiety releasing or chronic pain. There are free tapes on youtube to listen to. However, I belong to an audiobook club called Audible, which is owned by Amazon. I pay a monthly fee to buy an audiobook a month. My favourite author to listen to right now is Glenn Harrold. Mindfullness helps a lot of people. I do mindfulness meditation also. The author who really knows his stuff is Jon Kabat-Zinn. He works with patients with chronic pain and he's written quite a lot. His most well known book is Full Catastrophe Living. There are free meditations available from Andy Puddicombe on his website www.headspace.com - I really enjoy these. The other technique that I use is pinching a bit of my hand (which I can do discreetly when I'm out and about) when I am in pain or very stressed and panicky. It's a technique I learned from neurolinguistic programming (NLP) and some meditation tapes. It helps me focus, or, take the focus away from my pain. Debian, I don't know the difference between le and PMPS - I hope someone else can contribute to that conversation.",

My GP and his practice nurses blame everything on anxiety and also my oesophageal and larynx/pharynx reflux. I wonder if you've had reflux issues or been tested for them? I've had tachycardia for several years and my GP finally put me on beta blockers to control it. My echocardiogram showed a thickening of my aortic valve (which is bicuspid instead of tricuspid making me more at risk for valve problems). I also have MVP and mild regurgitation. I had a CT angiogram on Monday and am waiting for the results. I'll let you know what happens. I've been asking for a referral to a late effects clinic so that I can speak to an expert about radiation damage to my heart. I wonder if you should perhaps seek a referral from the same type of specialist? Someone who's an expert in heart damage from cancer treatment? How have you been feeling the past couple of months?",

Beaglesgirl, I feel bad about calling for meds too and here in the UK they are so money conscious (because all of our meds are paid for if you have cancer).  I try not to feel guilty because it's not helpful to relaxation and getting over the chemo side-effects.  At 3 weeks PFC I am still having soreness in my hands and feet but it is better than it was during chemo on Taxotere.  I hope your pain goes away soon.  Keep your mental strength.  I find keeping myself busy with anything - even drawing (which I'm not good at but never mind) helps.",

My first FEC was the 23rd of May.  My scalp is starting to tingle and as I pull my fingers through my hair I'm getting several strands out.  I'm feeling sad but I'm ready to deal with it.  I had thrush and sores in my mouth but the meds they gave me sorted it out in just over a week.  I suppose I'll get this everytime now.  I'm going to take the advice given here and try gargling with salt and baking soda. I used to get panic attacks and severe anxiety but now take Cymbalta to deal with it.  You can't take Cymbalta and some anti-depressants with Tamoxifen though so I'll have to switch to something else once I start finish chemo and start Tamoxifen. Thanks so much for the wonderful advice and support on this thread Ladies. Life is well worth the fight and I remind myself of this all day .",

Sometime during the ride home I lost one of the lashes. No matter, I had a great time out laughing and enjoying the return of some of my old energy. Nicole, I did have some leg soreness and a lot of weakness but 3 weeks post they are on the way to getting better.  I am struggling with gentle strength training exercises though.  Hang in there and rest as much as possible so your body can heal itself.  You'll know when you're ready to push it a bit.  Congrats on finishing your chemo!",
