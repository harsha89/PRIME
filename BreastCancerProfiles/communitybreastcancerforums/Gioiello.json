The radiologist spent quite a bit of time going over my armpit and was measuring something that I think might have been a node, but of course I'll find out the results tomorrow. I'm still worried, but at least I should get some answers at my appointment. I'm trying to be positive and focus on it being nothing sinister. I just hope that they can find out what is causing the pain and help me find a solution for it. ",

I am not sure if the lump I've found and pain I'm feeling are connected, or if it could be breast cancer. A bit history about me: I am about to turn 37, have never been pregnant (and therefore never breastfed) I suffer from hypothyroidism after finding a 5 x 4 x 3 cm adenoma in my thyroid 2 years ago. The adenoma was removed via a hemithyroidectomy, and my surgeon said the remaining part of my thyroid should work well enough without any medical support. Wrong. I put on 50 kg in 12 months post-surgery and ended up being put on thyroxine 14 months after surgery. My TSH levels are still not ideal and I am constantly exhausted, but suffer from insomnia as well.  I have a fibroadenoma in my right breast that was found in 2001, but no further action was taken at that time My maternal grandmother died from breast cancer at age 45 I have been experiencing/found the following: I have a combination of heavy, dull, achy pain in my left breast and stabbing pains under the nipple intermittently. I also have some pain in my armpit and radiating down the front of my arm. I also have pain behind my left shoulder blade I have found a lump in about the 2 o'clock position in my left breast and some lumps which might be lymph nodes in my armpit. I also have naturally lumpy breasts, but this feels more like a pea I also have an itchy nipple and the area under my armpit is also very itchy I have had some flaking skin on my nipple, I saw my GP and she thought it was a fungal infection and gave me cream for it - it helped for a couple of days, then did nothing I also have a bit of flaky skin under my breasts, but it isn't pink or red, just flaking off in fine chunks about 1/4 a 1/2 the size of a 5c piece I am tired a lot, but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the other symptoms or if it is just the hypothyroidism My hair seems to be falling out more than the usual shedding. I have to clean out my brush at least every 2 days and my husband has also noticed the extra hair lying around when he has done the vacuuming. Again, I'm not sure that this is due to the hypothyroidism or something else I don't know if I am over-thinking things, or if I have reason to legitimately be worried. I have had this breast pain for about 6 months, and did speak to my GP (who is also a qualified OBGYN) and she said it was probably due to hormonal fluctuations. Problem is, it is constant, not related to my cycle. I have booked an appointment for tomorrow and I intend to ask for an ultrasound.  I guess what I would like to know is what sort of ultrasound should I be pushing for? Just one over the area that is newly lumpy, or over the whole breast/s? I am not a suitable candidate for a mammogram due to the very large size and dense tissue in my breasts.  Thanks in advance for your advice.  Log in to post a reply",
