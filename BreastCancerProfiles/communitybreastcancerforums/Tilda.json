Yes, it sucks getting these news but I still have hope and I know there are more drugs for me to try. This morning I went to the hospital for a bronchoscopy/biopsy of my left lung. Unfortunately, it didn't work as well as the Dr. had hoped. I'm doing well but as it turned out, the one tumor has wrapped itself around the bronchial stem leading into the lung. While doing so, it has made the opening so narrow that the bronchoscopy tubing did not fit through the opening to enable a biopsy or to take any \"inside\" pictures of the left lung. I might need to have a stent put in to make my left lung inflate because as of now, not much air is entering that lung. No wonder I can't breathe well lately :{ However, the Dr did take several biopsies at the opening in front of the blockage and in the trachea that will hopefully contain enough cancer cells to use for the additional testing needed. I should know the answer within the next 48hrs. Should it by any chance not be sufficient, I will have to go in for an \"ultrasound guided\" biopsy next week which is a little bit more invasive and complicated (I have faith the Dr got enough). The procedure was fast and easy and went without any complications. Now the wait begins.......",

There is a 5cm mass, and 2 x 1.5cm lymph nodes in my left lung and 2 sub centimeter lesions in my liver. Tomorrow morning I'm having a lung biopsy to determine whether it is still breast cancer or possibly a new primary cancer (lung). As per my MO he's pretty sure it is BC since it appears to be in both lung and liver. I have been dancing with NED for 3 years but unfortunately the music has ended.

For my kids, I started a Cook Book¬†:) As they say; there's no better way to somebody's heart than through their stomach...I'm writing down my own recipes of the meals and cookies¬†that I know they love and I'm also adding recipes from my mother and mother-in-law (whom are both already gone). As I'm writing I remember¬†moments we have had at dinner time so I write them down too. Eventually, I'm going to go¬†to the¬†Snap-Fish¬†website and have it all put into a photo book. I have not told them what I am doing so they think I'm a little weird when I take pictures of them at the dinner table and of the food we're eating but I'm certain it will be appreciated one day:) I would love to hear about other things you ladies are doing to leave something of yourself behind.... Love and Blessings to all, Karin",

No one is safe from occurrences¬†but these celebrities just make it seem so easy to deal with cancer!!!¬†I think they are missing the big picture; too many people still dies every year from this horrible disease. If people aren't made aware of the truth there will never be enough research to find the CURE. I wish someone one day will finally speak up and go out to the media and let people know what is really¬†going on.",
