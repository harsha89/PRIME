As a psychologist, i get concerned when people start coining their own disorders and giving them similar names to actual psychiatric illnesses and then arm chair diagnosing someone. There is a real illness called munchausen syndrome by proxy, but internet munchausens something a lay person imagined. So what if someone is making something up. That's just a function of their own psychopathology. I think there is a lot more harm posting suspicions because that can make everyone feel unsafe, distrustful and leery of sharing for fear of not being believed.",
