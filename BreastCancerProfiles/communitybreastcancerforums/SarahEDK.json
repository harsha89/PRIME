I have silicone implants and have read about silicone lumps. My implants are beneath the muscle and this lump doesn't feel very deep so I doubt it's silicone. However anyone with experience with these lumps I'd love to hear it. I'm in health care, women's health so I do a fair amount of breast exams. Unfortunately for me i probably know too much. My lump is concerning so I'll get it checked out. But my question is this. I don't know if it's BC or not. But in the off chance it is I'd like to pull out life insurance and a short term disability plan. I have a long term plan and some life through my job but not much. My family would be financially ruined if I were to become unable to work. Has anyone done this prior to diagnosis? Does anyone know or have a company that they like? I guess it's a little morbid and maybe sneaky but we have to protect ourselves and families as much as possible. Any advice would be appreciated! Also, did the FNB hurt? Honest to Betsy that thing scares me more than anything! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
