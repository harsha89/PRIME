I thought, \"I'll just have to look like a Bigfoot.\"  Shaving an area with no nerves and stagnant lymph fluid sounded like a recipe for disaster. Then I thought of what chefs say, \"A dull blade is a dangerous blade.\" I finally used a regular cartridge, plastic razor, and just went very sloooooooow. Still got all kinds of nicks. So, I bought a high quality, double edge safety razor, with high-quality blades.  I cannot believe the difference! Shaves so smooth, and the weight of the razor does the work, so you don't need to dig into your skin.  You have to be very careful, because you're still using a very sharp blade, but oh the results are worth it.  My razor is an Edwin Jagger three piece with Merkur blades. Fifty blades is still cheaper than trying to buy cartridges or disposables. And I don't look like Bigfoot anymore!",

Previously, all of my energy was focused on this claim, now I can focus on exercise, nutrition, and LE care. I was thinking before, \"Ok, when is stage II coming.\" Now, I can afford all the good food I want, all the massage I want, anything to take care of myself.

I haven't followed them to a T, but for the most part I've stuck with the slow, gradual progression. For instance, I to four sessions with a certain weight, but then I might go from three to five pound dumbbells. Then I might go four sessions then go five to eight pounds. That much of a jump is a little chancy, but I can do it. What I wouldn't do is say \"Ok, I've worked with five pound dumbbells, now it's time for push ups.\" That flare up time.

These things you have to squeeze the heck out of to get strong, that's just sending in the lymph squad! Baoding balls will exercise every muscle in your hand very gently.

Priorities huh?  Well, $100 was a lot for a workshop, and plus we know so much about LE already, I'd probably be going through stuff I already know. Then, I went to the VA in search of a LE therapist, and the LANA certified therapist they have on the grounds hurt her back and isn't seeing paitients right now. I think I\"m going to drill them on their other therapists and if they don't sound qualified, I'll wait for the LANA person. At least she's in good hands, her own. Juzo garments should be in soon, maybe this week. So, a few slow steps ahead. Hope everyone is doing well.",

Anyone with LE or LE risk should pick and choose their yoga poses very carefully.  As Binney said, there's an exercise for everyone. Keep looking for it, the key is to keep moving, but gently.  About a month ago, I thought about taking up boxing. Great aerobic exercise I thought. Then I thought about hitting something hard with a LE hand and thought that wasn't the best idea. But, I can shadow box! Still getting the aerobic benefit and all I'm doing is hitting air. ",

Not Professor Klump, but I noticed something.  I also hike at high altitude, with heat and  insects that you can't avoid. I can't be miles out in the backcountry and have something happen and have to hike out with an inflammed arm. My work has a lot of repetitve motion and heavy lifting. Just a lot of factors that have me really thinking about my level of risk management. I'd rather just get an off the shelf sleeve for prevention during exercise or intense, repetitive activity.",

At the end of the MLD strokes, spend another 5-10 minutes focusing on the breath. If your mind wanders, gently bring it back to the breath.

Well, I found a gym nearby, and talked to a guy who is a personal trainer, and now I don't know if I want a personal trainer!   What I don't want is someone calling my doctor, demanding medical stuff, in general treating me like I'm broken. I have this condition, I have been trained in how to deal with it, I have the papers from Carol on things a personal trainer should know regarding exercise and lymphedema. I know how to handle things.  On a side note, I'm afraid of being blacklisted for massages also. I thought of just not telling them about my condition, but if the massage therapist sees the scars under my arms, they could freak out, make me leave. My damn back hurts, I get stressed out, I need a massage at least sometimes dammit!!! Getting worked up, grrrr, oops, wrong thread.

I'm thinking of breaking out the snowshoes and walking the road leading to the east entrance of Mt Rainier that closes every winter. That's my short term goal for the next few months. Snowshoeing, even though we're in the stormy months and the avalanche danger is very high. I will just stay out of the higher elevations.",

Never eat anything with more than 5 ingredients. You know how bread has about 20 ingredients listed? This is what it takes to make bread, whole wheat, salt, water, leveaning agent. That's it! This country is dying because of what we eat, and the FDA doesn't care, it just lies to us.  We factory farm our livestock, and by the time the cows are ready to be slaughtered, they are so sick they are almost dead anyway. Factory farming, high fructose corn syrup, ugh! Toxins-I just threw out two bags of toxic household cleaners. Now I have a gallon of white vinegar and a four pound box of baking soda underneath the sink. If something is dirty, one of those two will have to clean it, cause that's all there is. I also threw out some old plastic containers that were used in the microwave. Dang, no wonder I have cancer! I bought glass, and non-BPA containiers. I don't eat soup in the can anymore, nearly all of our cans have BPA in them. Gee, what a rant. Think I'll go eat some kale now.  ",

What I mean by the steri strips getting nasty is that there is dried blood underneath and little pieces of lint from my shirts. Theyre supposed to be falling off naturally by now, but since I tend to leave them alone, they still want to hang on. The PT even said, well try \"helping\" them along. I imagine by \"making the scars look better\", the strips are holding the skin together so the scar forms in a thinner line. That makes sense. I think it's time to email my surgeon and just ask her. ",

I was like, \"My life has turned into a hell.\"  I saw my surgeon and whined and moaned about the sensations that go all day with no respite and she said massaging the scars will help out a lot.   I've been massaging the scars three times a day, and what a world of difference. The scabs are coming off, I'll be able to keep scar tissue from forming, it quiets down the nerve sensations. A big boost to the quality of my life so far.  Still waiting on the oncotype score though.  ",

The question is, \"Can you build pecs to give some tone and form to unreconstructed breasts?\" (ex-breasts??)  The short answer is \"don't know.\" I know that's kind of anticlimatic, but she said there's no real documentation on this. She did say when doing work on the pectorals to not neglect the serratus muscle. That's the muscle that connects from the bottom of the shoulder blade to the ribs. If the serratus gets weak, you can risk serious shoulder impingement.  I did make clear I'm not looking to juice up and power lift, more like simple work with five pound dumbbells, working up to standard pushups if it doesn't tax my lymph system. She said it's always a fine line with a possibly compromised lymph system. Be very careful with any exercise not to overwork the lymph system beyond it's capacity, thereby triggering lymphedema symptoms. Of course we all know this :) ",

I am wondering if building up the pectoral muscles will give some better form to my chest. I know this sounds counter-intuitive, most women shrink away from the idea of \"big muscles\", but I want some bigness now.  My chest looks terrible, I want to lose the middle aged belly and get some muscle tone on my upper body.
