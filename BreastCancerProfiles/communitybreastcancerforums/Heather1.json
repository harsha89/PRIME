    "Content": "Heather1 wrote: I had a bi-lateral mastectomy 7 weeks ago. The drain on the right side was removed 4 days after surgery. However, the left drain was removed 3 weeks later. At that time I still had about 90cc of drainage every 24 hrs. One week later I returned to my surgeon as the fluid was building under the skin on my chest. He put another drain in. After 4 days he removed it, as there was no drainage. That was 2 weeks ago. Now I have another build-up of fluid on my chest. I will be seeing the surgeon again in a few days. I'm thinking he may have to put another drain in. I would really like to know if anyone else has experienced this problem with drainage. I feel as if this will never end. I wonder why this is happening to me. I do have Lupus and am wondering if that would have anything to do with it, as Lupus is a connective tissue disease. Is this a normal complication of breast surgery? Log in to post a reply",
