That incision feels mostly flat. The incision under my arm - about 1 1/2 inches where 2 sentinel nodes were removed - looks okay, like it is healing nicely. It's not red or warm or anything. But that area feels \"lumpy.\" It's like there's something under the incision. Originally, this area was very colorful and much lumpier - I figured perhaps it was just due to the nature of looking for the sentinel node(s) - the tissue was disturbed by \"rummaging\" about by the surgeon. Is it normal for it to feel lumpy about 10 days out from surgery? Will it likely stay this way, or resolve with time as the area re-adjusts? Is there something I'm supposed to be doing? It's the holiday weekend, so I was just wondering if anyone has suggestions, since this isn't an \"emergency.\" Thank you!

Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Just kidding. We've gotten some good information here, and I'm happy to hear that you got through your first day of work! It's both a blessing to have the distraction, I'm thinking, as well as a challenge to \"blend.\" I can pull off a few hours of looking normal and energetic and well-groomed, but it wears me out. So I am hopeful you're enjoying the excuse to get out and be distracted, while at the same time making sure you're getting rest to recover! I hope you get your pathology results soon, Shari! I should allegedly get my Oncotype DX results this week, and then my next \"cancer activity\" is to see a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist on Sept. 16th. So I'm in limbo for a couple of weeks here. I'm normally the queen of Girl Scout activities and volunteering at my girls' schools, so this limbo is rough. I just don't feel like I should commit to anything, because I just don't have a clue what shape I'll be in this academic year. This is the weirdest medical experience I've ever had - the periods of waiting, followed by a need to research and make choices between hideous options, followed by more waiting. I have noticed that what I have going on discomfort-wise is not pain so much as it is nerve craziness. My underarm nerves have gone nuts - I have what you described as \"burning,\" near the incision site under my arm, and then the middle of my underarm is numb but the backside is also experiencing some burning/sensitivity. My breast incision twinges from time to time, and the area the surgeon took tissue out of (my \"divot,\" up above the breast) is very sensitive, but the there's also an area on the upper outer section of my breast extending almost to the underarm where nothing was actually done that is EXTREMELY sensitive.  It all LOOKS fine, but I'm having a hard time finding something to wear that doesn't eventually make me nuts with the stimulation of the nerves. The soft, sleeveless cotton shirt I wore yesterday, which isn't tight, felt as though it was made of medium-grade sandpaper on the left side. Driving is not fun - the seat belt drapes all across the problem areas. So, I still have my initial question - is it normal to have a lumpy feeling under the SNB incision, and will this go away, or should I be worried and have my surgeon look at it? And I have a new question: What's the best way to deal with the nerve wackiness I'm experiencing? Is this something where I should only wear loose things for awhile, to avoid stimulating the area, because it will go away better if I do that? Or should I just try to get used to this by wearing normal things, because I'm probably stuck with it? Tylenol doesn't do a thing for this sort of discomfort, and my big gun pain killer doesn't, either, and I need to be able to drive and function. Is there something that would help calm these nerves as they regenerate? Hugs - but gentle ones, using the right side of my body only,  Coleen (alias Kleenex) ",

The lumpiness feels like there's something inside my body under the incision. shari1232 - I did get some information on lymphedema - I bought an electric razor with that in mind, because although I don't like the less-close shave, I hate the idea of having issues with a nick under my arm, where it's still partially numb. Annoyingly, there is a bit of skin that grows underarm hair on the outside of the incision. Breast cancer is just not going to make me more beautiful, is it? I saw my surgeon this past Wednesday, about a week after the surgery. The surgi strips on my breast were still firmly attached, and most of the ones under my arm were, too. I ended up being given little adhesive remover pads - sort of like Goo Gone for the body - to get the adhesive off. The surgeon inspected the incisions and pronounced them fine - she didn't poke or feel around at all - more of a visual inspection. I was hesitant to really feel them myself, until a couple of days later. I've been trying to do the stretches every day, while limiting strenuous activity or heavy lifting. I feel significantly better now, about 11 or so days out. It took a few days to shake off the anesthesia, I think. I got my results this past Monday - see my signature line for diagnosis stuff - and will allegedly get Oncotype DX score this week. I hope you get good results! Did your nodes appear involved? Is your tumor hormone receptor positive? Is the size an estimate, or did you have an excisional biopsy? You will be feeling a bit better by Tuesday. You'll need to protect your sleep at night to help heal, but it may be nice to have a distraction. Good luck on your new job! Hopefully it's not something too physical... ",

The initial swelling went down fairly quickly, in a few days. I mostly did only the gentle stretches to maintain range of motion, and tried not to do much else. Now, it looks fine - I can just feel lumps below the incision if I touch the area (seroma? scar tissue? residual swelling? who knows!). The actual area of the incision is numb - the areas around it are what were sore and now are full of wacky nerves. Sheila -  I will try the overstimulation with a washcloth, though I'm a wimp and that actually seems like it might be torturous. But so is having my nerves freak out when I'm simply walking around in a bra and a shirt. So it's worth a try! Thank you!",

I'd like to think that the cancer itself was mostly removed with the surgery, and that the radiation will finish off any stray cells and then the Tamoxifen will prevent spread of any escapees or new cancers that are hormone receptor positive. I am not \"cured\" until I die of something else, but I don't feel like it's something that I currently \"have,\" if that makes sense. The only definite thing is that diagnosis - I was found to be harboring cancer this summer - and this phase is treatment. I avoid giving the cancer a \"tense,\" because who knows? I could have been cured after the surgery. I could have remaining cells I'll fight forever. On the other hand, I have a friend who was diagnosed last summer with triple negative breast cancer. She had lumpectomy, radiation, and chemo, and will have nothing other than surveillance for the forseeable future. She definitively uses the past tense - she \"had\" cancer last year - because she did whatever there was do be done about it and it is gone.

And if so, why not use MORE of it? Does it impede the flow of the radiation - is it blocking the radiation in that area, which is why the skin looked better? In which case, perhaps we SHOULDN'T have tape over marks? I have no idea. I just know that the area that had the \"onion skin\" tape on it had less evidence of tanning/slight burning.

The book mentioned above may help him, but he will also be a lot better once you DO have good margins and can get the rest of your treatment plan in place. Some people are averse to taking medications, but I will add to what the ladies said above - I never in my life before took anti-anxiety meds, but in the window you are in, where you are trying to get through surgery and find out what the nature of your cancer is so you can formulate a plan, I also found an occasional Xanax helpful. It sort of derails those spiraling roller-coasters of scary \"What if?\" thoughts, and it can help you get a good night's sleep. Getting sleep will help you handle the days and make decisions as they need to be made. Walking is also good. Writing can be good, too - making lists of pros and cons for different options, venting in a journal, etc. You truly are at one of the worst parts of all of this, and I wish you the best of luck. You will shortly get through the \"get it all out\" phase, and that makes things a little easier. Coleen",

The entire purpose is to see if invasive cancer has spread to the nodes, with the theory being that it has escaped the breast and could be headed elsewhere in the body. Messing with the lymph nodes can create problems - even just taking ONE. So my thought is - why mess with that on the prophy side if you don't have to? Why not leave one arm un-tampered with, so you can use it for blood pressure checks and draws without worrying about lymphedema? Obviously, if it turns out that there IS invasive cancer hiding on the prophy side, you're in for a whole new ballgame anyway. Just offering another perspective. The Lymphedema discussion threads may change your perspective. There's this pressure to do everything you can - we're such aggressive Americans - but sometimes less is more.",

It's as though all of the cumulative sun exposure I've had appeared on the surface of my body at the age of 41. Also, sometimes if you are not out in the sun, moles you didn't notice before are more visible due to the lightness of the rest of your skin.

You can't apply the cream within about two hours before a treatment, but do not wash it off. I use it first thing in the morning (my appointment is mid-day), immediately afterward, and then right before bed. I let it dry before putting any clothing on. It makes a difference if I skip the post-treatment application - the skin feels dryer and looks pinker. You can use very gentle soap to clean the breast, or you can just rinse it with water coming from behind you, over your shoulder. You want to avoid anything stressful to the treatment area - hot water, scrubbing, rubbing, harsh soaps, etc. Less is more. Let your skin have air as much as possible - loose bras, loose PJ's, cool air, etc. The techs said some of the biggest problems come from treatment in the summer, when it's hot, and also with large breasts. The area where the treated skin meets skin below the breast can really have problems. People have mentioned that they put things like cloth diapers there to avoid that skin-on-skin thing. My tiredness comes and goes. Allegedly, it builds up cumulatively over the first couple of weeks and then perhaps plateaus and drops off. Frankly, the initial days are stressful due to the creepy science-fiction nature of the experience (and things like everyone else running out of the room while you lay there, half-naked, on the table), the ordeal of trying to get to a specific new location at a specific time every day, possible new fun with traffic, etc. There's also all that has come before the radiation: surgery, possible chemo, just the whole breast cancer experience. So why wouldn't one feel exhausted after the first treatment? How could you not? So be nice to yourself, and don't do things you don't need to do. You are teaching, and you probably derive some positive energy from that, but cut back somewhere if you can. You need to allow your body to heal it's normal cells. I hope it goes well for you!

I'm glad that you were able to pinpoint what was exacerbating your issues and that you found something that works. I think part of what we're dealing with is the MENTAL toll this issue takes on us. We can't easily do the things that we always do, and we have to rely on others, which we don't usually do. We have no control over this disease at all, and no idea what the future will bring. Sometimes I find myself getting angry at something totally stupid - it's just misplaced \"cancer anger,\" I think. I get mad at something that SHOULD be controlled, because the cancer can't be, if that makes sense. So I can actually understand how the wrong meds could trigger an extreme version of that.

I don't like the PA - I've only seen her once, but she is VERY young and I found her to be condescending and not particularly encouraging. Somehow, after I see the actual oncologist, I always feel positive. She's good at her job, and she's just about my age (46) and so seeing her is sort of like having coffee with a fun friend who is extremely knowledgable about a problem I'm having. I had a funny experience early on: I saw the oncologist briefly for the first time between surgery and radiation, and as they'd forgotten to call me in advance to tell me what my oncotype DX score was, it was at that visit that I learned that they wouldn't be offering me chemotherapy due to a low score (11). The pleasant surprise of that in conjunction with it being so early in the process meant I didn't take good advantage of that visit to ask follow-up questions. So six months later, they tried to schedule me with the PA. By that time, I was done with radiation and had a lot of questions about Tamoxifen and follow-up in general. The woman who was insistent upon trying to schedule me with the PA suggested I fax in my questions so that if there was any research needed, the PA could do that. I faxed in my 12 questions, and an hour later got a call from the office: they were calling to schedule me with the actual oncologist, due to the nature of my questions. Which is what I'd tried to tell them - I was NOT yet in maintenance mode, I was technically a new patient with treatment questions. On the one hand, I try to view the switching back and forth as an indication that I'm not high-risk, nor am I having a difficult time or undergoing difficult procedures. I'm just grumpy and sweaty and lumpy from Tamoxifen, annoyed that I had breast cancer in the first place, and pretty much convinced that it is more likely to come back 10 years from now than this year. The patients making decisions due to recurrence or questionable test results and those undergoing difficult chemo treatments are the ones who really need the actual oncologist's time. That said, if I could just see the oncologist herself and go only once a year, that would be just fine with me. I don't really need that other appointment that leaves me feeling icky and sort of violated. My oncology practice hands you a form early on that clearly lays out their scheme of alternating visits with the onc and the PA, with wording that suggests that you calm down and work with their system. That said, I think in your case, since you are like me, still getting your footing in treatment, you might consider making a list of your questions (including ones like \"Why are my follow-ups scheduled for every three months? Could we switch to every six months? Why or why not?\") and faxing those in AND requesting an appointment with your actual oncologist. The PA didn't say you HAD to see her (which is the policy at my office) - she said if you want to see the actual onc, you have to say so when you make your appointment. So say so!!! Coleen",

I'm hard to line up - they're trying to zap the upper part of my left chest/breast, so the angles are steep and I have to be just right on the table or the huge arm that holds the device that delivers the radiation hits the edge of the table and they have to start over. Much time is spent gently rolling me from side to side and then releasing - as though my butt is a beanbag and they're redistributing the beans. Sometimes, they almost have to kick the release on the right side of the table, to get it to work. Also - one of the techs went on and on yesterday about the fabulous, newer machine next door.  I assume I was supposed to be impressed with the extra effort and skill that goes into dealing with a \"block\" that has to be inserted to keep my heart from being radiated, etc. On the OTHER machine, the computer would take care of that, she said. Many other details were provided about that amazing machine next door. I said, \"So I'm on the old Chevy Nova machine, and there's a sleek new high-tech vehicle that other people are using right next door?\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"But that newfangled computerized machine breaks down a lot more, and your machine is nice and reliable.\" I asked if perhaps I could make a scene to get the newer machine, and she assured me that I could not. I don't need the elaborate things it's capable of, she said, and they need to save that schedule for the people who do. Somehow, I really didn't feel reassured. I'm good with radiation being a tried-and-true treatment. I'm NOT good with thinking it's old or outdated. I think the key to radiation must be to not think about it too much.

Even with having a lumpectomy, as I did, the genetic counselor said it's not about the breast surgery, once you've had cancer. It is partially about helping your family members learn if they have anything to worry about. But it's really very much about YOUR ovaries at this point. If you happen to be BRCA positive, you have quite a high risk of developing ovarian cancer, and there are NO reliable screening tests for ovarian cancer. It's usually detected once it's already stage IV. Knowing your BRCA status can help you figure out if you have to worry about your ovaries or not.",

Some facilities here do one at a time, most do both at the same time. One surgeon told me you get better quality doing one at a time. The point being that perhaps the solution moved through you too quickly, and the last portion of the second breast didn't show up well. Or the machine's image quality wasn't as strong at the end. It doesn't sound ominous to me. Just like a pain in the butt! I had \"extravasation\" in both forearms from the imaging solution that showed up about 24 hours after each procedure - the speed with which the imagining stuff whipped into my arms caused it to leak out of my veins and then my lower arms swelled up for a few days. (Other than breast cancer, I have no health issues at all or problems with my veins.) Very annoying. If you've noticed this in whatever arm you used, have them slow the solution down!

The technicians implement the plan that the radiation oncologist sets up, and I found that if I talked to them, I got a very defensive \"hey, I'm just doing what she told me to do\" response. I had weekly appointments with the radiation oncologist herself, preceeded by her nurse, and that was the time to discuss things. There are apparently a lot of \"standard\" radiation fields determined by \"standard\" breast surgery, and if your case is a little different, you need to keep reminding them about that. It seems to me that cancers on the edges of breasts are a little less common. Mine was way up on the inner upper portion of my left breast. It struck me as goofy that they zapped the whole breast, including areas seven inches away from where the tumor was, but that's what they do with whole breast radiation. There wasn't enough tissue to consider any other concentrated type. However, when they went to do my boosts, I had to speak up three times because they were calculating the boost area based on my lumpectomy incision, and NOT based on where the tumor had been. For cosmetic reasons, the surgeon went in just below the \"bra cup line,\" and then tunnelled up to where the tumor was, a couple of inches away (this was to avoid leaving a big scar in the middle of the neckline of every shirt made). I guess normally, tumors are mid-breast, and assumed to have been directly below or right by the incision line. They plotted my boost, barely including the original tumor site, and then I insisted that the radiation oncologist come in and take a look. She totally changed the targeted area, creating a zone that included both the former tumor site and the incision area. If I hadn't been a bit of a pain in the butt, I'd have had a nice dose of radiation that skipped the area most likely to experience recurrence. Lori - with your slightly out-of-the-norm tumor area, and with it being close to the axillary area, you really need to make sure the radiation oncologist addresses your concerns and knows where your tumor was. I had two concerns: (1) that the doctor understand clearly where my unusually located tumor was, and (2) that she communicate to me her plan in a way that I bought into it. Good luck! Coleen",

My husband's business and business partner are up in Fort Worth - we couldn't find anywhere up there where the schools were good AND we could afford the houses (two girls - 11 1/2 and 13 now). My breast surgeon is actually in Bedford - Dr. Mary Brian at the North Texas Breast Center. She was recommended by two women down here who are her patients and really liked her. I will say that you can ALWAYS do more surgery later - there is some benefit, I would think, to getting the cancer they know you have out with as little recovery time as possible and getting started on treatments. He could also be taking your age into account - you could still want to have children (and nurse) after this, and you also might be more likely at this point to have a good, symmetrical result with one real breast and one reconstructed breast... Another thing about my surgeon - she has a \"patient coordinator\" who sets up all of my appointments - she's not doing it herself. She apparently has some pull, because her office was able to get me appointments for a bone scan and CT scan and visits with a plastic surgeon she uses and also one with an oncologist in just a few days. Dr. Brian was my second opinion - and I was able to get in to see her for the first time in about a week. I think you have time, if you want to talk to someone else. There's a woman down here in Mansfield who took some time to research surgeons and ended up with a good one she said came highly recommended in Fort Worth - I will look up her e-mail and get her name for you, if you'd like. Is this a private message thing? I have no idea how that really works... It's important to like your surgeon - but it's very important, I think, to feel comfortable with the approach he/she wants to take, as well. My understanding is that it's usually taken a while for the cancer to grow to where it is, and you have the week or so it takes to get a second opinion. You are young, and your cancer profile looks more aggressive, so maybe they do want to get things moving. But you should feel on board with the plan.",

It was nice to just do one at a time. Tamoxifen is systemic, but your skin is part of your system, in addition to which radiation penetrates the skin... Also - I read a post somewhere on here that radiation is more effective on cells that are \"active,\" so if you take Tamoxifen and block any possible breast cancer cells' access to estrogen, you may be limiting the effectiveness of your radiation.

I've developed a second one, sort of adjacent to the first, but I'm back to official stretching exercises and probably will go see the surgeon this week. I had an annoying conversation with the breast surgeon's nurse. This practice is all breasts, all the time, in a building with oncologists and imaging and related things. In any case, the nurse did not seem to have a clue about \"cording\" or \"axillary web syndrome\" or anything related, despite my repeated attempts to describe it in a way that would make sense to her. She kept saying it was \"scar tissue.\" IS this scar tissue? My thought was that it was a reaction of the lymph passageways to scar tissue - that the scar tissue forming in my underarm area at the site of the SNB is limiting the smooth flow of lymph and also restricting the movement of these lymph channels, and so instead of being tucked up nicely into my underarm, they are shorter and tighter and I can see them when I lift my arm... How does this sound like scar tissue: \"I have this line that crosses the upper part of my underarm - it looks like there's a piece of string under there, and when I raise my arm at certain angles, you can see this string-like thing pop out, whereas the other underarm is nice and smooth and concave.  My SNB incision is in the lower-right side of my left underarm, and this area of concern is sort of from the upper left to the middle right side of that underarm.\" So is this scar tissue? Or a reaction to scar tissue? She suggested I could pop in and see the surgeon, but I must say I am concerned that she hadn't heard of the terms \"cording\" or \"axillary web syndrome.\" Is the surgeon such a brilliant operating machine that they never hear from any patients who develop this? Or did I speak to the wrong person at the practice? Or am I subconsciously grumpy because I don't have my OncotypeDX results back yet, and I'm supposed to meet with oncologists tomorrow?

      "Content": "Jan 19, 2009 01:52PM - edited Jan 19, 2009 01:56PM by Kleenex I'll throw my 2 cents in here. You're at what was, for me, the WORST part of this whole ordeal: \"picking\" a surgical approach to treat the local cancer. I agonized over it. I very briefly had a bilateral scheduled, but then I had a total freakout and meltdown, and decided to start with the lumpectomy. Immediately, I felt a sense of relief. We got okay margins, and I went on to have radiation and am now taking Tamoxifen. Both breast surgeons I spoke to said it was totally my choice, which was bizarre to me, as they are supposed to be experts and there is SUCH a difference between a lumpectomy and a bilateral with immediate reconstruction. The plastic surgeon I spoke with was extremely gung-ho on doing the bilateral, which is how I ended up scheduled for one. He insisted that it's what he'd tell his wife to do. From the perspective of the plastic surgeon, it's obviously easier to start with fresh, unradiated tissue and do both sides at the same time. When I spoke to the oncologist, he was horrified that I'd consider doing a bilateral for what he called \"such a small tumor.\" \"No one does that anymore,\" he said to me. That's when I cancelled the surgery and really started reading in detail about both procedures. Remember that the statistics repeatedly show that the rate of SURVIVAL and SPREAD (mets) of breast cancer is the same with lumpectomy and radiation OR mastectomy. Local recurrence rates are higher with lumpectomy, obviously, because there's breast tissue left, but spread and survival are the same. Lumps in breasts don't kill people - spread does. You are not 100% guaranteed to skip out on future breast cancer issues by removing your breasts. On the East and West coasts of the U.S., they do more lumpectomies. This is also where the major medical centers that come up with all of the newest treatment ideas are located. One thing I also noticed is that in stories of cancer doctors who ended up with breast cancer themselves, the women always started with a lumpectomy. If that failed, they did single mastectomy. None of them started out with a bilateral mastectomy for an early stage cancer. (I read four such stories in different sources. Also, the type of surgery you select does NOT change whether or not you'll have to have chemo or will be offered Tamoxifen. You have to weigh your personal tolerance for risk with your tolerance for major surgical procedures. If you have a lumpectomy and even a re-excision with good margins, it's not too difficult of a recovery. Radiation is a pain, because it's done daily, but with a small tumor in the right place, you could be a candidate for one of the shorter radiation trials and be done in a week. Bilateral mastectomy with immediate DIEP reconstruction is major surgery that will take you out of your life for several weeks, if things go well, longer if they do not. Your risk of a new breast cancer drops, but, again, your survival rate and risk of spread is the same as with lumpectomy. You may find from your MRI and genetic testing that you might be better off with a single or bilateral mastectomy. You may also be the kind of person who worries each and every day that it will come back. Perhaps you've already had many biopsies and scares and you've had it with your breasts. But maybe not. You can ALWAYS start small and do more later - you just can't go back to your own breasts later if you've removed them. As I've said on another post, Americans are always into \"more is more\" medically. Sometimes, less is more. It seems that many women on these boards support a more aggressive approach. Back when I was trying to decide what to do, women here and in my life were very supportive of a \"get rid of them\" approach. If you do go with the bilateral and reconstruction, you will find wonderful support here. Just remember that many, many women quietly have lumpectomies and go on with their lives. Coleen",

I think it just sort of seems dangerous or something, and I found that I was concerned that they might be doing something wrong. As though with my total lack of knowledge of radiology, I could possibly have a clue what was right and wrong. It helped me a lot to talk with the radiology oncologist, to have a clear description of \"here's what we're treating and why and how,\" etc. So the suspicious part of my mind was calmed, although I must admit do sneak a look at the lucite block each time to ensure that it has my name on it... This is all very overwhelming stuff, and I think it's understandable that we have a low tolerance for NEW surprises, once the first big surprise (breast cancer) is revealed. Good luck to you!

And I'm very fond of the \"poor me, have some chocolate\" diet, as well! You don't want your weight to change during rads because it changes the alignment of the tattoos, etc., and so the treatments might not hit the correct areas. Especially if it's a 6 or 7 week thing. I've heard that people receiving radiation to their supraclavicular nodes can have issues with indigestion or swallowing - is this the area that's being zapped? It might be good to treat yourself to some pre-cut fruit trays or veggie trays, or cut cheese and crackers. If you haven't been eating, you can justify the expense, because of the money you saved!

Your choices are generally a \"core\" biopsy of some kind, where they take a piece out to see what it is, or an excisional biopsy, where they remove the entire identified area of concern. My original area of concern, when identified on ultrasound, appeared to be about 7 mm. My surgeon recommended a core biopsy, because then we could find out what it was. Then if it was nothing, we could still remove it in a very non-invasive way, but if it was cancer, we could plan to remove it with good clear margins around it and also remove a couple of sentinel nodes at the same time. The surgeon will examine you and look at your films and also answer your questions. Birads 4 is the \"we don't know what this is\" category. Not definitively cancer, but not necessarily nothing, which is why only the biopsy will tell you what it is. That's what makes it warrant a biopsy - it clearly shouldn't be there, but it's not clear what it is. There's still a high probability that it's just a cyst or something. I remember being very annoyed and horrified that they couldn't just LOOK at it and see what it was, instead of having to go inside me to get a piece.

Most women who get breast cancer do NOT have a family history and react by saying, \"What?!!!\" That said, it's likely that you just have a fibroid cyst or something. I hope it all goes well!
