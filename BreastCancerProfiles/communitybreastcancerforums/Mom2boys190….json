The ultrasound didn't show any thing with the ducts. I have to say the day I had my appointment with the Breast Surgeon it was a clinic day for him at the Comprehensive Breast Center. They were very busy that day with scheduled diagnostic testing and then had to add in the patience that the Surgeon wanted to also have a mammogram and ultrasound. The ultrasound tech I had made it very obvious that she was in a hurry to get my ultrasound over with. She was quick and even at one point was done and I told her that the surgeon wanted her to ultrasound the area where I am having pain. She said to me in a huffy tone, \" I didn't even see anything on the mammogram I don't know why I have to ultrasound there.\" (first of all why is the tech reading my mammogram)  And when I was trying to show her the spot she just told me to move my hand! Then I went back to my room and with in a few minutes she came back to get me because the surgeon wanted more pictures! No joke!! So we were standing outside the ultrasound room waiting for the patient to be done and the tech stuck her head and then said to me, \" that's the signal for them to hurry up!\" When the door opened there was a little older women covering herself and I was sad thinking that the tech was just herding us like cattle! I felt like a statistic and not a human. She didn't think anything was wrong with me because most likely there isn't. A week after that appointment I did call and let the director of the facility know about my experience and she was so sorry that happened. If I didn't love the radiologist and breast surgeon I wouldn't be going back. I just didn't feel like they took the time to really look at my mammogram or ultrasound because they already had a preconceived idea that it's nothing. I am going to make sure at this next appointment with my surgeon that I feel comfortable with everything said and done before I leave! I had a friend die 10 months after her diagnoses from the cancer spreading to her brain. And statistically that shouldn't have happen to her. She was only 38 yrs old, no history. They didn't find her breast cancer until it had already spread. ",

I thought I would check it. And out of one of the ducts there was some watery discharge with a little dark color to it.  Thanks again for responding. I pray for health and happiness for everyone here. ",

That's great to know, thanks. i am so tired of being poked at and tested!! I was diagnosed with a muscular dystrophy last Feb and it was a nightmare of testing including a muscle biopsy. But because of all that I realized that statistics are good to know, but it doesn't mean it can't happen to you. So even though statisctically I am most likely looking at nothing but a benign issue, I just want to be 100% sure. ",
