I found out a year ago that I am BRCA2+ and had a small tumor in my breast....I am only 27. I had my breasts removed, (bilateral mastecomies with immediate reconstruction) because I saw what my mom went through just to live. I saw the struggle she went through everyday to live for her kids. And now that I have kids, why would I just sit around and wait for that to happen to me? So if you know you are VERY high risk, and have weighed your options, then do what you think is right FOR YOU. We only get one life.  ",
