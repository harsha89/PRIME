But I can't get a dr to take me seriously because of my age in on my 4th Dr trying to get someone to do something and it's only been 2 weeks and they are getting bigger but no one is listening. You are very lucky that the drs where you are don't take younger women lightly. I hope everything is ok with you and I'm glad for you that your doctor's are brushing you off like mine. Best of luck.",

I'm 25 as well and the way these so called drs just brush us off makes no sense. My right breast is a cup size bigger than my left with sharp pains going from The lumps to my nipple sharp enough I grab because it hurts so bad. All of things have happened recently but no one wants to take a 25 year old seriously about this. Even though I can bring up research that proves there are becoming more and more cases of this in women our age in recent years. So much so that it's getting close to the number of post menopausal women. It a infuriating. I say keep at it, I am.",
