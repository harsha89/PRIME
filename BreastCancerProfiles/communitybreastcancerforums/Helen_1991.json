Will this procedure ensure that all of the areas with atypia around my one microcalification cluster are removed, or will the open biopsy just take a larger tissue sample to check for possible cancer? If the second choice is true, what if the surgeon misses some areas that have potential to become cancerous over the years. My wish is that the area where I have a microcalcifications cluster with atypia cells be completely removed; I would not like any atypia remaining in that one spot. After having consultations with some breast surgeons, some seem to rush me in getting the atypia removed while others recommend that I have a mammogram follow-up every six months. For those who have gone through my experience, I would like to know what y\u2019all have decided for yourselves and what your doctor suggested. I\u2019ve heard about Dr. Roshni Rao and Dr. Mary Brian (if anyone know anything about these doctors or any other breast surgeons in the Arlington-Dallas-Fort Worth area, please share with me your thoughts). Thank you so much, Helen Log in to post a reply",

I will be scheduled for surgery in a couple of months to get this area removed. @MelissaDallas Have you had any surgeries at UT Southwestern before? I am from Dallas myself and I plan to have surgery at UT southwestern very soon. The thing I am mainly concerned about is having students, residents, and/ or fellows with the Dr in the operating room. I understand that UT Southwestern is a medical school and there will be times when the Dr will bring in their students, residents, and/or fellows for observation or maybe even allow them perform some surgical procedures themselves. However, I think that they should give patients a chance to decide if they allow this or not. I chose UT Southwestern because like you said, it is a designated NCI center and I know they always have up-to-date techniques and tools. Therefore, I put in a lot of trust and faith within the facility and the doctors there. I just don't like how they do not guarantee that they will not bring in a student to help with surgery, etc. We always make sure that we choose an accredited and board certified surgeon to perform our surgeries (but sometimes the outcome may not come out to expectations). In this sense, how could they possibly give students permission to work on our body if they are not board certified themselves. Please tell me what you think Melissa; I'd like to hear opinions from everyone else too. Thanks, Helen",
