Neurotensin is a satiation hormone that is produced in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract. This is the first time a satiation hormone has been linked to these three common diseases in women. I had some very interesting reading today ..... But now I might be getting a little concerned . The little bit of background i put in my other post did not include that within the last year I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes then a few motnths later it was high cholesterol ( over 300 ) and now I'm waiting for my biopsy ( birad 4 )..... Now for these three being common in women ...... Are they common all at the same time??? I called dr office and now have an appt for the 30th to get blood test. That is one day before the biopsy. The findings of this study is to catch these things early to help prevent them from happening but my question is .....if this is the case of having elevated levels of this hormone and already developing at least two out of three at this point ( really hoping on not having the third ) ... What can be done???? 11-2012, ILC, 1.8 cm, stage 1c, grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+ /PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I have been reading all day on cons and pros and I'm now more confused !! I posted on the other post I have going which tells a little more.... Localized??? I really need some advice!!! I know it will come down to what I want but right now I have no idea..... I keep changing my mind.....with the diabetes healing time could take longer with high blood pressure and high cholsterol that could lean towards heart disease and doing radiation treatment could make it worse. We have an appt in the morning with the radiologist to go over the treatment .... And the thing about the hormone pills that were taken away yesterday and having to go see a gyn...... Ohhhhhh toooo much!!!!!!! Sorry I'm all over the place...I just don't know what I want to do!!! I wish that I didn't have a choice and they just said this is what we need to do..... I think it might of made it a little easier. 11-2012, ILC, 1.8 cm, stage 1c, grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+ /PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

It was not working so they put me on levofloxacin for seven days. The infection finally cleared up . But now after another three weeks I'm having issues with extensive amounts of mucus and spots of blood in stools . They said that the antibiotics killed all the good bacteria and the bad ones took over... so right now while waiting for test results to come back I am eating yogurt at every meal and taking probiotics twice a day. I am also waiting on starting treatment due to infection and then when no one ordered my oncotype test. Now waiting for that test to come back to see if I need chemo before the radiation. Good luck to you with your treatment !!",
