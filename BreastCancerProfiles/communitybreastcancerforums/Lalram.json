    "Content": "Lalram wrote: Hi all, I am new to the group. I was diagnosed with a fibroadenoma of ~3cm back in Nov last year. I was advised for a biopsy because the lump looked a little suspicious and was not a perfect oval shape. The biopsy results showed a benign fibroadenoma. The lump is not visible outside and is in the 8'0clock position. The lump causes pain intermittently and is very painful during ovulation or before menstrual cycles. I had another ultrasound after 6 months and the size hasn't changed. I am planning to get pregnant, maybe next year and wondering if the fibroadenoma will be a major hindrance and will cause excess pain. Would you recommend a surgery to remove it before planning for pregnancy? How much can the fibroadenoma increase in size during pregnancy? Is there a chance where if I just leave the lump with no surgery, there is a possibility of another lump to come beneath this one and make it harder to find? Please provide guidance.
