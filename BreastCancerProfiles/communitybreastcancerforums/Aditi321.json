BRCA1 & 2 were negative.  My mother had breast cancer twice and died at age 52, her sister died from breast cancer, 3 paternal aunts died from breast cancer, my 2 brothers, my grandfather, my father and most of my 6 paternal uncles had prostate cancer (there is a link to breast cancer),  My oncologist said there are undiscovered genetic markers for cancer so not to rely totally on BRCA. ",
