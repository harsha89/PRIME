A bit premature, but I reminded myself that the surgeon said she got all the calcs..so this was just a formality. But when I saw the mammo they did to insert the wire, the calcs were still there! Lots of them, pleomorphic and branching linear. Now I'm scared all over again! Has anyone been through something similar with a benign result? I still don't entirely understand what ails me. Surgeon says this is not ADH or FEA. What else is there? I am especially nervous as remaining calcs go right up to the chest wall. And why oh why send a cancer liaison to reassure someone who has not been diagnosed? Is this protocol? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Deb55 wrote: My rational self knows I should not worry, and yet I am.  Background: 44 years old, premen., extremely dense breasts, multiple benign biopsies. Maternal grandmother died of bc at 64; father died of colon cancer at 62. Recent mammogram showed pleomorphic calcs on both sides (30 mm on left, 5 mm on right) both  up against the breast wall in the middle of the breast (virtually mirror image). Core needle biopsy, right side fibrocystic change, left columnar cell change with focal atypia, usual hyperplasia. Surgeon recommended lumpectomy of left breast.  I have done research and it seems that the concern with these types of cells is not so much future risk of cancer, but the possibility that actual cancer is hiding out (as it is in about 1/3 of cases, as I understand).  I have several questions: 1) Has anyone had experience with this particular type of lesion? 2) If so, what was the outcome? 3) How bad is the lumpectomy for an area of this size (30 mm)? (no lymph nodes being removed) 4) Should I ask for an MRI? My breasts are extremely dense and I worry about what else might be going on.  Thank you in advance!!! Log in to post a reply",

I'm sure this will all be fine, but it has been hanging over me for two months, more mammos than I can count, multiple appointments, and still nothing definitive. The literature is very mixed on this, from some who think it's nothing, to others who think it's a red flag for cancer. The only thing they all seem to agree on is that we need more research.  I will just be so relieved to have an answer. If it's b9, I go for 6 month mammos. If it's DCIS, I deal with that. I just want an answer. I am not normally a such a baby, but this is really throwing me for a loop.",
