They are doing more CAT scans on me next week to prepare for boosts -- 4 I think after 16 regular. So nice to be able to cross off each day -- and yes -- I can hardly wait to be able to put on deodorant!",

Part of this is self-preservation, I'm not sure I could endure the hand wringing and constant anxiety. Here's to moving forward on our own!",

Told the 30 yo kids (I'm the wicked step-monster) and grandkids about the bc yesterday. Reassured them that its going to be okay, and I'm still their Gran who wants to go to all their athletic events, movies, school shows, etc. They were concerned we hadn't told them when we've known since before Christmas, but understood when we explained we aren't telling my 93 yo parents (at least not until end of treatment) because my dad is a retired doctor and lost all of his female cousins to bc 40 years ago. His only reference point is that and he'll go to pieces if we tell him. Luckily, none of the SE of rads are so bad I cannot hide them for a few hours to see my parents. ,",

KayFry -- The treatment center is on my way into work from home (and closer to work than home) so yesterday worked out okay. Like you, I'm starting to get the fatigue. My RO said today that he expects I'll \"hit the wall\" later this week, but should be able to get through it. He's glad I'm continuing to work out every day and just advised that I cut back on work hours for the next week or so -- though he also understands that my job's in busy season right now. Just gotta let go a bit -- things will get done and my staff do have my back. Skin is in pretty good shape except for hair follicles which make it look like I've got a whole new set of freckles across my chest and get itchy when they get warm -- so trying to keep them cool. Starting to get pretty pink under my arm, but only have 2 more regular treatments and then 4 boosts. After the infection after the lumpectomy, I think I'll be able to handle 6 more treatments. Happy St. Paddy's Day everyone.",

Skin is looking pretty good, definitely is darker, a little itchy, and still using the Aquaphor (at least until I use up the last of the big jar I started with). My nipple looks like a bullseye with a dark ring around it. Still getting tired in the late afternoon, but that may be because work is insane right now -- only have 718 emails to catch up on! :>) Appt. with MO is for the 17th and expect to get put on Letrozole then. Had a bone scan done and it came back normal, but my vitamin D was really low so have added that to the regimen. Am a little concerned about the SE of the drugs, but am approaching it as the life raft! Hope everyone has a calm, relaxing weekend. It snowed this morning, but is now clear and sunny and supposed to be 70 on Sunday.",

This board has been a wealth of information, support and comfort. I'm on some other ones too, but this is the one that feels the most like home. Can we keep it going? Who's with me for continuing? New normal for me, is like KayFry, to try to get back to as much of my life as before. I work for the state and love my job (though it has its days and stresses), but the folks around me are generally wonderful. Love my home (townhouse in the city but feels like its kind of in the country), my garden, my DH, and my pups. Don't get to see enough of the grandkids because we live on opposite sides of a fairly large city and I'm one of 8 grandparents, but cherish the time we do spend with them. Looking forward to a summer of trips to the wildlife sanctuary, the museum, riding bikes, swim meets and soccer tournaments. Will see my MO next Friday and expect to start on letrozole (AI). A little scared about the bone/joint pain SE but have been working out almost every day since they released me after lx. Hope the fear is more in my head, like it was for rads, than reality. At 2.5 weeks out of rads, skin has really calmed down, though I have peeling and tight skin over my lymph node incision. Also have a fairly big seroma (about the diameter of a small apple) that it hard and sore, but I'm trying to ignore it and hope it goes away soon. Hope you have a relaxing weekend! Sunday night we're having dinner with our best scuba traveling buddies and hope to be planning our next trip.",
