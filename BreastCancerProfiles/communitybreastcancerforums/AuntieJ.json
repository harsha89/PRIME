My radiation is due to begin soon, and I may face other chemo options after this ends. I too am concerned about a few things including additional exposure to radiation and a problem with my VAD in my right upper chest-which will still be in place when I travel to Ireland in March. What kind of information will/should I have in hand when I travel. I too feel that the 'new' pat downs are very humiliating, and should not be done as wide open areas for others to watch. I had partially considered the full scanner method-but I have concerns about my port and being further humiliated by a full assaultive pat down. Suggestions please.",

After reading so many posts-mostly more recent posts, it truly does make me wonder if reconstruction and all the potential complications(and of course, I would be the one with the complications) will be a consideration when all things are healed and treatments are completed. I had asked about bilateral masectomy-and they did not feel it was needed. I am a big person, but comfortable with the surgery that was done, and now with more things to think about including reconstruction. I am not missing that left breast at this time-glad they got (hopefully) all the cancer. Once the drains were out, and the staples out..found comfort in a tank top with a shelf bra. Now in casual clothes and yes, it is fall in New England..we do wear layers---I am comfortable with the unequality in size of my chest. Not sure how it will play out when I need to get into professional office attire, or interview attire in the future. So thanks to all input in this column-you have given me many things to think about...and since this will be the only time since this journey began, it is nice to have choices...as one person said, her breasts did not define who she is/was. So thanks for all the comments. The jury so to speak is still out.",
