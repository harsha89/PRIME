I was 8 weeks out of surgery yesterday and feeling pretty down about the possibility that LE can change my life for good. After reading some of your posts, I got out of bed and walked a mile for the first time since surgery. It was slow, but it was a start. I am trying to understand the abbreviations so that I can be proactive in keeping LE away. So if possible can you answer from your experiences some questions for a newbie! Does everyone get LE? I had 33 lymphnodes removed, 18 contained cancerous cells, so I will have radiation after some chemo I am doing now. Is my chance greater due to the number removed? What is MLD, should I do that every day to prevent, or do you start it once LE sets in. What's Ledeb? I got a DVD from the American Cancer Society with arm exercises, is that the same? Do you find dietary restrictions help ward of swelling? What have you found to be the most reliable online resources available also. Should anyone recovering from breast cancer start physical therapy with an LE specialist, or did you all wait for an LE episode to occur to begin PT? Sorry for so many questions, I really want to be informed so that I can make good choices with my care.",
