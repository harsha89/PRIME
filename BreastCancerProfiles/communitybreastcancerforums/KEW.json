      "Content": "Dec 8, 2009 07:08AM - edited Dec 8, 2009 07:09AM by KEW Hi-- Try not to focus on the size of the nodule.  Smaller is not always better and bigger is not always worse.  It depends on the biological characteristics of the tumor, if that is what it turns out to be.  A tiny tumor can be very aggressive, and a big tumor can be sleepy.  I know it seems nearly impossible, but try and stay in the moment and not project too far into the future, and stay away from the \"what if\" thinking that can really raise anxiety levels.  Regarding size, it often changes if surgery is required.  It can be smaller or larger than imaging shows.  I had two tumors, but the pathologist after surgery measured them together, so I ended up with a larger size.  It has to do with staining the area.  This is a very difficult time, waiting and wondering, so be gentle on yourself.  For me, I read these threads when I was first diagnosed and then stopped until a few weeks after surgery and after I met my oncologist.  I just became to freaked out, I too have panic attacks, so I understand your level of anxiety. I hope all goes well when you meet the surgeon. KEW ",

I miss Marin, but it has changed so much from when I was growing up in the 60's and 70's.  I'm glad I grew up there because of its beauty and being so close to San Francisco and Berkeley. I finally moved out in 1984.  I have a water color painting of the Audobon House at Richardson Bay, by Blackie's Pasture.  Were you there when Blackie was alive.  I fed him carrot as a very little girl.  I just remembered I know another native Marin woman who was diagnosed a couple of years ago, she was probably 43. Thanks for the kind words about my mom, and me.  Same back to you, how's it going for you?",

I've never had any flu shot, but I'm back in grad school and working 40 hours a week at  my university, so I'm on two campuses--we've had grad students who've gotten H1N1, one of them talked me into getting the vaccine yesterday.  We also just had a student teacher at my son's high school  die from it this week. I've had pneumonia 3 times and had some nodules found in my lungs during a CT a couple of months ago, have to have another CT in a couple of weeks.  I'm not as worried about the H1N1, as I am the number of people getting pneumonia afterwords. Trying to get it for my son seems an impossible task. KarenW ",

Binney is right, go slowly, besides you gain more strength with slow movements, those folks you see in the gym screaming, huffing, and puffing, and moving their weights really fast, are not gaining the best benefit for all that work. I would not do anything without seeing a PT first I think  it is very important and can prevent doing the wrong things, and help maximize doing the right ones. Best, Karen",

I noticed you talked about massaging your arm.  My PT, who is LE licensed, gave me directions on how to do a massage that began at my wrist, down my arm, under my arms, towards the center of my stomach, under my clavicle and up from the groin area towards the stomach--I may have some of it out of order.  This really helped me a lot because it helps to get the whole system moving.  I couldn't get my arm down because I had LE alongside my breast and ribcage, trunk LE maybe? I was backed up.  Once I started doing this regularly, thing began to clear up.  I still have that swelling inside where my elbow bends, but hope it will get better over time.",

I was cold for an entire month after the surgery, my heating bill was double from the year before. For me it was good to have another adult in the house to keep my 15 year old on track in school etc.  Folks brought food for about 6 weeks.  I also hired someone to clean the house for me once a week for six weeks (gifts from co-workers paid for this).  I couldn't drive for about 8 weeks because I have a clutch and I couldn't get it into first or reverse.  Have lots of zip up hoodies and slip on shoes, I was unable to dress myself for a couple of weeks, I couldn't get pants on without help, but I had some serious pain on my left side where my drain was. As mentioned above if you have pets, someone to take care of them would be very helpful.  Also, when you have your post op ask your surgeon about cording a fairly common experience, it is when the lymph channels shrink and tighten--it doesn't happen to everyone, but if it feels like you have violin strings under your arms and it hurts to extend your arms  forward you may have some cording.  PT can help with this. I wish you all the best in your surgery and recovery. Karen",
