It took me by surprise and I was a little concerned until I found other patients who shared this odd sensation. I told my husband it was like having brain freeze in my chest. You could feel the cold so strongly. Glad to hear it goes away!!!! Can deal with anything on a temporary basis. Glad your feelings went away.",
