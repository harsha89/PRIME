IDC, right side. Early and optomistic. My surgery is set for Nov. 2, next Friday! DXM, immed tissue expanders. Yikes! This whole thing has been such a roller coaster, but I have really tried to stay positive and have renewed faith! Now though, at a week out, I am kinda freaking out!! Any advice ladies? Kelly",

I love your advice about the pampering and a nice scenic drive...that sounds amazing.
