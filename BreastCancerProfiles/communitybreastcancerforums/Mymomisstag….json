Probably that is the reason that he has not hurried to make the switch. But If the current situation is from hormonals than I guess the chemo is next step because this in no quality of life anymore...Or there still is some miracle painkiller she has not tried.",

Some have described similar pain. I´ve picked up that maybe Cymbalta is smt to try for the pain. I also wonder about the fact that if she is switced to Chemo, is it possible to go back to Hormonals later? I haven´t understood really, why there was not tried any other AI besides Arimidex before faslodex. I have understood though, that faslodex is her last chance to hormonals.",
