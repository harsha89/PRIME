I am starting day 14 tomorrow and I have 6 more to go after that.  I am just starting to notice a little difference in my skin - it just started to pink up a little.  I have noticed the difference in my fatigue and stamina though.  I am really tired in the late afternoon.  I guess it doesn't help that I broke my left arm 3 weeks ago (fell down some steps) but thank goodness it wasn't my surgery arm....I was so nervous about that.  I am hoping the black cloud will quit following me!  I have been reading your posts though - hope you don't mind if I join you!  Happy Sunday!",

I guess I will have those answers by the end of the week.  My RO is recommending 20 treatments and according to the study that was mentioned here, that is right on track with the current literature. I was just curious about a few comments I saw at the beginning of this thread.  A few of you said that you quit drinking diet coke immediately after diagnosis.  I don't drink coffee, but I do drink a few diet cokes a day - usually no more than two, sometimes only one.  Is this something they told you upon diagnosis?  I do know that drinking any kind of soda is probably not good for you, but I was wondering if there is some other info you were given about the diagnosis of breast cancer and diet coke?  Thanks for the info.

So many times I just want to give it up and think I should just do it.  The worst is the diet coke from McDonalds.  I swear they must add something to it - it just tastes so good.  I know some people feel that way about coffee, but I never had.  I notice that our stats are about the same.  I just got my oncotype score yesterday (16) and I feel so very lucky that I don't have to have chemo.  How many rads did you have?  Lemon, I hear you on the good eating.  I know there are so many changes I need to make.  Your MO's answers were interesting.  It's good that you are trying to make some healthy changes - I KNOW what I need to do - doing them is a different story.  I just feel lucky to be given the chance.  Thanks, rads girls for making me feel welcome to this group.",
