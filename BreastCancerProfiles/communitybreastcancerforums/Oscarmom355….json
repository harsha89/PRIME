I needed a stereotactic biopsy, made it on the table 5 minutes and couldn't take the pain in my back and hips. I have osteoporosis that doesn't help. I told them forget it. My Dr got me a surgeon, had the biopsy 10 days ago. Dcis. Lumpectomy yeterday. Both under general anesthesia. No pain, no bruising, barely need tylenol. I just prefer to be knocked out",

He stressed slightly, 20 minute surgery, breast will not be smaller. Asked if we could do this after May vacation and he said normally sure but my vacation starts end of May. Since you healed so well we can do this tomorrow. So, tomorrow it is! Oh and when I said can I go to Tom Petty April 27 he said of course. You were fine 3 days after last week's surgery. If you change your mind I'll buy your tix. Funny dr. So surgery round 2 tomorrow. Round 1 was last Monday. Get it over with, bring on vacation Log in to post a reply",
