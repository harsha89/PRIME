Basically the deal is that I am now 5 years out (I had my last rads treatment in January of 2005) and I am constantly having \"false alarms\", and having to go back for extra mammos and ultrasounds. Every time this happens it freaks me out just a little. Also, they hurt. They ache pretty much all the time, and every now and then I get a stabbing pain that makes me wince. They are heavy and dense and lumpy and they hurt when they bounce. They make it very uncomfortable to do many types of physical activity. I haven't been able to lay on my stomach comfortably for years. Ever since I had rads my nipples are erect all the time. The air temperature makes no difference. This makes me feel very self-conscious: I can't even count the number of times I've been asked if I am cold, or told my \"headlights are on\". They are not attractive: they are saggy and mismatched. I have now had a hysterectomy and an oopherectomy, so I'm not gonna need them for nursing ever again--- So my question is, how do I get a bilateral mast 5 years out that doesn't cost a zillion dollars? I have so much family history it's ridiculous, but none of it is \"1st degree\" (Grandmother, Great Aunt, 2 Aunts, 3 cousins, all on my Dad's side). Is there a way to have this done through insurance? Anybody know? Thanks again for the warm thoughts and helpful info. Jude",

The pain, lumpiness, dense tissue, and such have ALWAYS been issues for me, before I was ever dx'd. The worry about recurrence mostly comes from constantly having \"areas of concern\" on my mammos and getting called back over and over for additional films. I did have the genetic testing, in 2005, and it came back negative. ANYWAY! Here's what I really need to know: has anyone gone back 5 years after lumpectomy and asked for bilateral mast with reconstruction and had it paid by insurance? Even partly? And if so, what hoops did you have to jump thru?  Thanks to any and all for your help! Jude",
