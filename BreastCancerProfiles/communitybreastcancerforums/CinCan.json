My coworkers gave me the pink ribbon blanket and I use it everyday when I curl up on the couch to watch TV.  I LOVE IT!!!

I only have a few upper lashes left and as of yet I don't see any new growth....and this also makes me nervous.  The hair on my head has started coming in very sparse and very fine... it's also all salt and pepper.  Are you getting Herceptin Infusions?  I wonder if the Herceptin slows the hair growth....as I'll be on it through December.",
