My good friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months back and she set up a PostHope site (http://PostHope.com) and it was much better than caring bridge. The site she set up was beautiful, easy to use and had a donation page on it where 100% of the donations went to her. I would definitely give it a try. Oh, and there were no ads either =)  ",
