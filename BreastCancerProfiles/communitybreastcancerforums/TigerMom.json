    "Content": "TigerMom wrote: I had a mammogram and us Thursday after having found a small lump in my right breast. US actually showed two masses very close together. Radiologist said she didn't THINK they were anything, BUT they weren't exactly oval as she would have liked and not as uniformly colored as she would like. I also have a family history on my dad's side. At the bottom of the paper they gave me was \"BiRad 4,5\"  Not knowing what this meant of course I googled it and wasn't thrilled with what I found. Do they give each mass a score? I guess maybe it could mean I would be on the upper end of the four range? Why say you don't think it is anything and then list it as a 4,5? I'd rather you just say \"I think we need to check it out and go from there\". My nurse from my gyn called before I even made it home and was a little overboard with telling me not to freak out she was setting up the appt and would call me Monday. I didn't think anything about it until I figured out what the BiRads numbers were and wondered if she thought I might freak after seeing a 5. I've already told them I would opt for removal. I also had a fibroadenoma removed when I was 16, but have had none since. Any input appreciated. I'm kind of confused about the mixed signals. Log in to post a reply",
