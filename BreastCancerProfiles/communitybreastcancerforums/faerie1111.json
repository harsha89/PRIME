So I think it depends on what biopsy you have done. Only thing is we are the ones sitting and waiting getting nervous I'm sure the drs know this but it would be great if there was a quicker way of doing these things the waiting is so hard .My fingers are crossed for you that you get definite answers soon remember 80% are b9 my last one was yippiee:) thoughts are with you take care x",

I will wait for dermatologist app as I don't want to be a pain and Ian (my partner) is probably right . And know I don't have a fever just a booby that warms up like a hot water bottle.

My booby feels like it's been used as punch bag and lymph nodes feel like golf balls (great fun) not!!!.  It's not as bad as what my aunties going through she has a lump on her lung which she has been told could well be cancer but they have to wait 3months to do biopsy as it's to dangerous at the moment they have to wait for it to grow a bit more to be able to get neadle in safely . But on a lighter note I have found out that my long lost sister lives only 15 miles away from me and we are meeting up on Sunday I have only seen her 1 time for a couple of hours in 41years so at least that's something to look forward to(nervous but excited). Anyway how's you doing did you get any answers and did you manage to get pet/ct scan ?  Getting referrals here is difficult to near on impossible unless your leg drops off lol.

So everything is slow, if you have money I expect it's all done in a couple of weeks .

She said she wasn't sure on that and she asked me if I had appointment to see consultant and if so is it soon I said yes on Thursday and then all she said is good. So don't know what to think now as ibc is rash ,thickened area, lump above collar bone ,palpable lymph nodes and swelling, I have all that ,but not much itching hope that's a good sign.good luck with the dermatologist hope you get the biopsys you want I'm sure it would be a lot easier for you getting them done where you live.

I had a bit of a moment earlier thought I might have to go to hospital ,started with ringing in ear tingling down arm then started spinning I couldn't see anything then about 20mins later a stabbing pain in boob ,I think these things get stranger and stranger at least all ok now .

Does a dermatologist check lymph nodes as well as check the skin ?just a little concerned now, the node under arm is quite large and the one in neck not going away could it be due to something else other than cancer and itching is persistent I still seem to be digging into my head and back with my nails .

Everything needs checking I'm sure the other lumps are probably cysts but they need to check thoroughly  as they keep missing things and I would say mri is probably best as it checks everything at same time and better to see through dense breasts . Thank you for being here sweetie you have been great I think I would have struggled a lot more if I didn't have you to talk to bless you !!!!  Good luck on your check up on the 20th how are you feeling do your nodes hurt after being drained ? Take care hun x",

I went to breast clinic with it and they palmed me off and just said they don't know what it is I'm a strange case and I have a lymph node up in neck and under arm . So if it wasn't for Melissa suggesting dermo I wouldn't be getting it checked (so thank you Melissa) Dianne please push for answers and be your own advocate fingers crossed for you let us know how you get on x",
