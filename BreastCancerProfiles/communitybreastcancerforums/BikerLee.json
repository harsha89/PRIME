I eat right, I exercise a ton, I drink a little too much beer (few a week)\u2026  But I got cancer. Why?  People around me eat terribly, drink a ton, never exercise, and they don't get cancer. Why? Wouldn't it be nice if we could say this thing or that thing caused the cancer\u2026 Then we could tell everyone exactly what causes cancer and prevent a whole heck of a lot of disease. Bottom line is that some of the things we are exposed to, whether through our control or not, may contribute to developing cancer\u2026  or may NOT\u2026  We honestly don't know enough.   I used to heat my tea water in a carbonate plastic container - bpa city!  I grew up eating highly processed foods\u2026 There are things our grandmothers may have been exposed to that are known endocrine disruptors\u2026 and evidence shows effects in our grandmothers' granddaughters. How crazy is that???? What's my point?  There's no way to know WHY you got cancer. Even people who have tested positive for various cancer genes may never go on to develop cancer... while others do\u2026   So, put that energy into facing FORWARD. You say you were an athlete? Why \"WERE\"? What did you love to do? Being active during chemo (which I assume is part of your treatment plan since you now have a port) is critical to reducing side effects and suffering.  I heard that time and time again. As a bike racer, my obvious exercise of choice is riding bikes. So, I did that every single day during chemotherapy\u2026.  Except for a couple of days of business travel (no access to a bike).  Some days were short and slow\u2026 but most days were just fine.  Was I racing? No\u2026 but I was active and moving and it really did make things better. I also worked and stayed socially active (except for a total of about two weeks, during which my counts were super low and the health care providers told me to avoid unnecessary exposures to people). As for the weight-gain-loss cycling\u2026  This is a common struggle for former athletes\u2026 You are not alone in this. So\u2026 get active and stay active! Learn something new!  I learned how to skate ski and ice skate so that I have fun winter sports even though I still commute everywhere by bike\u2026 Turn your transportation into active transportation\u2026  Do whatever it takes to return to that love of sport / action / movement.  And don't wait - do it now\u2026   As for the port incision - I was exercising the next day. I kept the effort aerobic\u2026 but I was riding the next day. Ask your health care team about how long you need to wait before safely exercising\u2026. It might be sooner than you think. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this in your 20s.  It sucks - no two ways about it. Hugs. Lee",

Neuropathy - anyone doing any kind of chemo that has neuropathy as a potential side effect should consider adding GLUTAMINE as a supplement during chemo.  You can buy this as a powder... Take about 10 g and swirl it in water, and then drink up!  It doesn't have much taste, and it's actually made it through some clinical trials.  The upside is that it does not interfere with chemo but does reduce some pretty icky side effects, like mouth sores and NEUROPATHY!   So, ask your onco about adding it.  Mine was HAPPY to say YES!   A rather large container of glutamine powder runs about $25. I went through two containers.  I had minimal tingling in the very tips of my fingers and toes... but it was really quite minimal.  More like my toe tips and fingers tips just sort of felt weird.  I had the taxol stage before the AC stage, and that weird feeling was gone by the time I was done with AC, actually.  During AC, the glutamine made a difference with mouthsores.  I slacked off... and paid for it...  got back onto the glutamine wagon, and the mouthsores were much less severe.... No matter what - GOOD LUCK!!!!  May you have maximal effectiveness with minimal side effects... Lee Google scholar search:  glutamine chemotherapy or glutamine chemotherapy neuropathy etc...

And by ugly, I mean ginormous ugly looking white heads on your scalp! The things look painful and are painful. Not everyone gets them, but I sure as heck did! And there\u2019s no way a person could tell me \u2013 oh \u2013 they aren\u2019t really all that noticeable! The docs all told me to just leave my head open to the air. I just couldn\u2019t do that because I found the acne to be so \u2026 well\u2026 embarrassing! They also said no hot showers! I love hot showers! They also said don\u2019t rub your head when you dry it \u2013 just pat it dry!!!! NONE of these things helped even one tiny bit. So, I did some research\u2026 and combined things I found in order to come up with my own recipe for success. Lee\u2019s two-step recipe for a smooth and acne-free chemo scalp. ONE: When you shower, use hibiclens (available at pharmacies - same stuff i used before my port installation surgery) on your head. Do not let hibiclens get into your eyes or ears. Use a dime amount in the palm of your wet hand\u2026 Before your head gets wet, rub that all over your head for around 15-30 seconds\u2026. RINSE SUPER WELL! Your shower can be as hot or not hot as you prefer. TWO: After you shower and your scalp is dry, use a salicylic acid solution on your head. About a dime to nickel size amount in your palm \u2013 rub over your whole head\u2026 I believe that you are free to rub or pat your head dry. I like to rub because it just feels good. Then, Once totally try, wear whatever you like on your head. Viola! Within about one week, my horrid scalp acne had completely resolved, and I was once again willing to let the world see my bald head.  Lee Penn's totally acne-free and smooth bald head.

After showering, use a salicylic acid solution - around 2% solution - as can be found in solutions for acne treatment. I got mine at our health food store. I just put some in my palm and rubbed all over my head. Within days, I was sooooooo much better! And by better... I mean what a RELIEF! That scalp acne HURTS and is UGLY!

Repeat after me - YES PLEASE THAT WOULD BE SO WONDERFUL THAT WOULD BE A HUGE HELP THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH And... If someone has said something like \"let me know if there is something I can do...\" which is the most vague thing.... Take it as a genuine offer of help. Yes, there are a few things that could help us very much. Would you be willing to have our children overnight on xxx date? (our son had an overnight the night before my bmx) Would you be willing to have my children for a short tme after school? (our son had one or two after school dates with the neighbors per week) Would you be willing to go to chemo with me? (my better half went with me every time but one, and a friend went that time) If you are worried about puking in your friend's car... How do you feel about your friend driving YOUR car? I rode my bike to every single chemo... And rode home... And I was totally fine. The one time that I was pukingly ill was after the fourth AC - I didn't get sick until HOURS later.... The anti-puke drugs they give you before the AC really do help... And should keep you good until you get home. Then, make sure you take the meds as the NURSES suggest. They know which to take when.... Do you have a tendency to get motion sick? Apparently, if you had a tendency to get motion sick, then your chances of feeling nauseous with AC are higher.... I do, and I did. But I adhered to the meds, and that made it better... Finally - I highly recommend that you take GLUTAMINE as a supplement during chemo.... For days 1-4, with chemo day being day zero, take 10 g swirled in water three times each day.... It will help with mouth sores and neuropathy and so on... For me, the one time I slacked off this supplement, I got horrid horrid mouth sores and had to have the magic mouthwash. If up I google GLUTAMINE and taxol or chemotherapy, you'll find a treasure trove of results... Including results from some clinical trials showing that GLUTAMINE is a good good thing during chemo.... Good luck... May your first infusion go smoothly - no surprises.... Oh - last bit of advice. If you are feeling really anxious, consider requesting ativan.... That there is a lovely little drug that just makes the whole experience less stressful.... Ad helps with nausea to boot!",

ICE ICE ICE!!!!  and so on...   5)  do self lymph massage a few times per day - especially on long endurance ride days...  there are several really great youtube videos that give good instructions for self lymph massage for post-mastectomy and node dissections...  i used to be quite anal about this...  maybe it had the hoped-for result... or maybe i just wasn't one of the unlucky ones with regard to lymphedema - who knows...  but i did self lymph massage regularly to position myself for the most success possible.   last - and most importantly - LOVE YOUR BIKE... keep it in good repair... keep a look out for wear on your tires...  do your abc check before every ride...  all to maximize your happiness on your bike but also prevent mechanicals that could lead to a mishap...  and ride ride ride... me?  during the \"on\" season, i ride anywhere between ten and twenty hours a week...  sometimes more...  i love riding - i use bikes for recreation and transportation and hauling things and people... i also race, and i love racing...  i race on road and off road... this year's new race venue for me is gravel racing... never done this, but it is HOT these days...   keep the rubber side down... lee ps - feel invited to pm me if you have questions... i'm happy to do my best to answer questions and so forth...",

I think the spot on her lung makes her stage IV, right?  Unless it turns out to be unrelated to breast cancer...   I called her yesterday, and I told her that if there is one person she can be all negative with - that'd be me.  I told her that she has to choose such people carefully.  So many expect the positivity to be the ONLY attitude... and we all have bad days, whether we're cancer patients or just regular people.  But, when we're cancer patients, people do not want to see krankiness or any other less than positive attitudes / feelings. I've offered to research anything she'd like (I'm at a University, so this is fairly easy for me to do). It was a pretty long phone call, actually.  She clearly wanted to talk...  so I feel like that was a good thing.  Beyond that - I'm not sure if there's much I can do.

We're not terribly close - I mean - we're family... but I've only spent time with her around a dozen times.  I don't know her very well.  But, I want to be a source of support in whatever way is possible.

Also, it will help you feel a little more energetic while you're awake. For me, Xanax is my go-to for insomnia, which I have had since dx in July.  I really miss sleeping like a baby... I used to be such a great sleeper!  Now, it's hit or miss... More miss when I don't get exercise.  Less miss when I do get exercise.  Definitely not regular. Sigh....",

PAIN SUCKS and does not help one heal up. and ask about using capsaicin containing stuff (cream, ointment, etc...)... cuz wouldn't it be great if she could use something that doesn't involve taking a drug? turns out, there's a crazy bunch of bike racers out there (i'm one of them) that race in mud and snow and sand in cold weather. we use this stuff called embrocation. i recently one this little pot of capsaicin containing embrocation at a race, and i put some on my scars... and it's been a good little discovery. in case you're curious... the company name is donkey label and the embrocation is \"medium\" .... i really like this stuff, and it also moisturizes! and i happen to really like the way it smells. also, pharmacies carry capsaicin containing creams and such as well. she might have to wait a little bit before applying something directly onto her scars, but it might prove effective on her back where she has no scars. i had those weird sensations like what you describe - and phantom nipple sensations too... even if she has to wait a couple more weeks, consider trying it out once she's cleared for application of stuff onto her scars. word of warning - capsaicin is the stuff that makes hot peppers hot... it's also a main ingredient in pepper spray... so - don't get it in your (or her) eyes! i've accidentally done that... ooops. good luck.",

I MEAN SOOOOOO MUCH LESS.. don't know if you;re struggling with that.  ",

My heart has been aching all day as we were meant to hang out with some of our friends today - at a big parade here in Minneapolis- the May Day parade.  Alas, the mom of the family ended up in the hospital Friday night.  She has stage IV bc.  My better half and I both feel we cannot even begin to imagine... and hope we never have to experience the stage iv reality. I don't know if it is okay for me to post here.  I think this is a GREAT post for people to read.  It never ceases to surprise me when someone says something particularly insensitive or even just down right stupid.  Yet, what training do we get for talking about these issues?   I hope this post helps me be a better friend to my stage iv friends (breast cancer and other cancers). Hugs to all - I hope you have a peaceful afternoon. And Happy Mother's Day to the moms! Lee",
