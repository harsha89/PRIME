      "Content": "CJJJK3 wrote: Never had problems before but about 1 month ago woke up and notice when turned on my right side in bed & my breast hanging that I had a pulling sensation. It feels like comes from under my nipple and goes outward. I waited for a couple weeks, thinking maybe I bruised some tissue or pulled a muscle... but still there. The breast also just feels a bit different & in going about my day I feel the soreness (not pain) a bit now and then. I have made an appointment with my OB/GYN but it's 2 weeks off. I have no typical indicators, no lumps, no denting, no nipple inversion, no leakage, etc. Mammo about 6 months ago didn't show anything. The only thing remarkable might be that that the breast looks a bit smaller than the other one. I have no idea whether it's always been like that or suddenly I'm aware of it because of this. Breast cancer on my father's side only, 2 aunts & cousin (1 aunt & cousin passed away, other treated & lived). I know my doctor has to examine, run tests, etc. but just wondering if anyone has had similar? Log in to post a reply",
