Can anyone give me their opinions in both of these procedures - do they work .... Log in to post a reply",

I must say that both operations were better than expected, not that painful at all - that was 4 years ago and I think the way they do things are improving all the time. So please don't worry, write down your questions and ask them, at the time I really didn't know what was going on I just wanted the cancer taken out - have you got a breast care nurse you can phone - mine did help me a lot.  take care Sarniexx",
