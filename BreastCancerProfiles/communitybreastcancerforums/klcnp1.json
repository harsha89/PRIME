They are now discussing my case with many other for ideas/opinions as the science is not dictating how to treat me because I am outside of all the boxes. ",

Also, save to your favorite topics and it will show up in your favorites when you log in. Sorry to hear of your complicated story. But what you will find is Breast Cancer is not straight forward and sometimes presents in weird ways. You are blessed that is was removed and found and you can move on with a great medical team who can get your through your journey. When you are discussing the research and the outcomes, usually its discussed in relative rate reduction like 10%. So you think it means that if you have a 13% rate, it would drop to 3%....NO, its not, it equates to 2-3% ABSOLUTE rate of reduction so it drops from 13 to 10-11%....Thats a big difference. Lots of chatter about it on this site.",

They said insurance would not pay for Herceptin since I wasn't officially HER2+. Hope all goes well for you and your treatment. It is a tough situation with things fit in the middle ground and its not black and white.",

My HER2 testing on biopsy was equivocal. My HER2 testing on tumor was equivocal via ICH and FISH thus sent Hi Resolution HER 2 in which pathologist called it HER2 low (not enough to call me a HER+) so we sent Oncotype and it showed me again in the middle zone with score of 25, after much discussion we sent Mammoprint which shows barely in high risk zone. I am starting radiation first and then trying to decide if I need chemo. With the Mammoprint coming back as high risk they want to add chemo but they aren't sure how to treat with me being Stage 1. They don't think I need the entire ACT tx, and don't know whether or not to treat me with Herceptin. Chemo may reduce absolute risk by 2% so I am not sure if the benefits of chemo will out weight the risks for only a 2% reduction rate as I am sitting at 11-12% reoccurrence rate now. Has anyone else been diagnosed as HER2 LOW...if so, what was your situation and treatment plan if you care to share. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

SO I am not actually HER2+ ( I have some negative and some +) so they are calling me HER2 low..because I don't fit in the negative or positive box! Initially based on ONCOtype Score, we were doing radiation only but decided to send Mammoprint...we needed to get treatment started. We were hoping the Mammoprint would help to support the decision of radiation only. Now that Mammoprint came back high risk (I'm barely in the risk section)...they think I need chemo but aren't sure how to treat me being stage 1, Gr 2, luminal B and this weird HER2 LOW....she isn't sure if I need Herceptin or not. I seem to be perplexing the medical field.",

If so, your MO can give you your predicted 10 year risk of distant reoccurrence based on your own clinical pathology. .... First, when discussing percentages, we have to be specific. Risk reduction can be discussed in relative or absolute terms. A relative risk reduction of 50% may sound like a lot but if only 2 women out of 100 have mucinous breast cancer and for those 2 women, the chance of revisiting the disease is a relative risk of 10% , then the absolute benefit is quite small AND, what little benefit there is, it doesn't appear for many years further out in time.",
