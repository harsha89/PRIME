    "Content": "Hoosierbillie wrote: I got called to take a 2nd mammogram. The 1st 1 was a 3D. The lady from Dr office said it was due to calcifications in both breast and maybe an ultrasound next but needed this for insurance. Reason I'm not sure if I trust her is one I have really good insurance and mostly because I went and got a copy of the 1st mammo report. It said more and a bit different than office lady did. It said grouped calcification in right breast in same area as a 2.5cm asymmetry. Then it said left breast asymmetry in a different area of breast but nothing about calcification. The report also said suggest US for left breast and may need for right breast. The report sounds way different to me then what I was told on the phone. Is this normal and I'm just paranoid or is the Dr office not disclosing all information? Thanks for advice just nervous. Also I've read on here that some people get radiologist during a mammo. I didn't on first one do you think I will on this one so I don't have another week of waiting Log in to post a reply",
