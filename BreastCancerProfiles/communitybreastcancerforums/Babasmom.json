    "Content": "Aug 14, 2017 06:58AM - edited Aug 14, 2017 06:59AM by Babasmom Hello All. I feel like I know many of you already as I have been reading for some time. I actually started chemo in July as well and had my 2nd treatment last Thursday. My SEs have been horrible. Though this time around was better than last so I am grateful for that. 6 days in bed. I am amazed at those of you who are managing to get out everyday and hoping I will get there at some point. My body is just reacting differently. I am reading so much about constipation yet I had uncontrollable diarrhea last treatment. Sorry to be so graphic with strangers but I guess this is the forum to do it in. My MO says it's from the perjeta. She finally gave me limotal (not sure of spelling) after what I think was way too many days. And unrelenting migraines as well. Anyone else having these issues? Thanks for listening",
