Why mess around with radiation? I would never allow two lumpectomies on the same breast. I know the statistics, but my gut tells me why keep a mishappen breast and lose one's life in the bargain?",

The Nottingham score calculation is based on grade and lymph node and size. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Prognosti... That is 2.06 for me, so I have to enter the minimum value of 3. The other two equations result in scores of 35.8 and 37.3. Onco reported 7 to 10 percent of recurrence, which would be beyond nasty, and normal lifespan with chemo. Low grade and stage means found early, high KI-67 means nasty if it hadn't been. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30... So this set of criteria said that there is no need, in my case, to send for oncotypeDX testing, since it was serious enough for chemo without reservation.",

Edited to add: I start thinking of medical stupidity, and noted that I see more left-sided BC here. I looked it up, and sure enough, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23... Probably because the left side is more able to steal blood supply being closer to the heart. I have/had two second degree relatives, the genetics are not that strong.

I had started vaping juice with CBD instead of nicotine about a month before diagnosis. Once diagnosed, my consumption doubled. I finally got frustrated because it wears off so quick (good for panic attacks), and suggested to my doctor an increase in my beta-blocker. She agreed, and it is easier. Reaching out to survivors you already know helps. We are here to help each other and there may be support groups in your community. Some short-term professional counseling can help. Relaxation techniques will help. I have been playing music for hours on end, unusual for me. Turning to whatever spiritual/religious community with which you have the strongest links will help, and I know that many here agree. Others will have other suggestions, but I know that you are stronger than you think you are. And if all else fails, a second medical opinion may give you more options, or set your mind at rest that their recommendation is the best course of action.",

I went to the city on the seventh, Onco said that drain needs to be pulled.When I last saw the PS in Nov, he said that it couldn't be pulled until it had produced less than 20 ml for two days in a row. But he said that the local clinic could pull it with his consent. I have an appt in the city on Monday with another PS in his office. The woman at the local clinic was finally able to contact the other PS, who confirmed that it could be pulled tomorrow at the local clinic, especially since I have reached the celebration mark. I have an appt later with OT, but I need to get get this thing pulled so we can determine if it is the drain that is causing right arm decreased ROM.

Ordered a set of patterns for headcoverings, and watched you-tube for several hours. I am NOT going to pay twenty dollars each to cover my head. I have a wig ordered, but need to call them back and find out what is going on with it. Went to the audiologist and got new tubing. I complained about problems understanding with my hearing aids covered with headwraps, so she tweaked a few frequencies in the speech range. I'm getting better clarity. If she had turned up the entire profile, I would have had more problems with feedback. My HA's are getting too wimpy for my loss. My onco said that Taxol is rarely associated with hearing loss, and the audi said that the one which really causes problems is Carboplatin (?SP--definitely not in my treatment plan). We decided to go for a full audiogram when this is hopefully all over with-- there might be enough further loss to qualify me for new HA's with bluetooth capability!! I may need to take a chemo vacation-- this neuropathy has me frustrated. I did do a lot better with my walking-stick, and moved them to just inside the door, instead of behind it. Put my name on them in case chem brain intrudes. But my bloodwork this morning looked reasonably good to my uneducated eye",

My reasons for going along with it: I live alone, and no family in the area, no special activities, and I got my presents sent. Fear of waiting two weeks. More interest in the religious aspects than the secular festivities. Gratitudes are that I live alone, thus less chances of catching colds and flu and suchlike. Gratitude that despite the fact that I have minimal income, I am living comfortably. Gratitude that I am able to save up enough money that I can take a vacation from chemo in Feb to go down home and visit son and other family. Gratitude that I have enough hobbies and interests to keep busy. Gratitude towards the medical treatment I am receiving allowing me to live a normal lifespan of 85 years. The sermon at church yesterday was about this, with me in mind. Now, all I have to do is get through this week with port installation tomorrow, and first infusion on Wednesday. ",

I did laundry, called the clinic to make sure that a nurse was available for a port draw for next week; the other nurse had already called. I called the Cancer Society liaison.Then called a friend to ask if she wanted to discover an antique store she had probably never been to. She said of course. The cancer society lady called back, and gave me the information for ordering a free wig. I then spent half an hour on the phone ordering the wig. They had very few grey wigs left in two of their collections, but they had some nice grey ones left in their collection for \"ladies of color\". One was slightly marcelled,and so cute!!! Then my friend called back and she barely made it to an appointment she had forgotten. She finally picked me up, and, sure enough she had never been to that store. Then we had a late lunch, went to Wal-mart, I got some headbands and some spray starch for fixing up my haul of doilies (In case you didn't notice, I collect doilies). I finished washing the dishes, Got the doilies washed and hung up in the bathroom. I have a long piece of fabric to iron for a quilting project. Then I misused some lidocaine ointment for my port to numb the pain from my scalp so I could give those nasty hairs a good rubbing and brushing. I am NOT going to shave my head! Tomorrow should be a day for sleeping. I certainly hope so!",

I had a badly cystic ovary when I was 23, and it was removed. I have had three children, two living, both at the cusp of 30, but no grandchildren yet. I breastfed my two babies for a total of five years (nothing like milk and no baby to set that off). I have only taken hormones for a total of six months while I was in grad school (school psychologist). Doctors have fussed about righty for years. Told me to quit drinking coffee to reduce fibrocystic disease (yeah, rigggghht!). Then fussing and ultrasounding a pea-size cyst in righty. Then several years later a needle aspiration of said cyst-- diagnosis, old milk. I was scheduled for a mammo, and asked my physician to excise a sebaceous cyst because I was afraid they would call it something malignant. By the time I was called in because of concerns about my most recent mammo, I was, just, like go ahead and poke and prod, you people just get all in a dither over nothing. So went in for a sonogram, and they decided to do a core biopsy because they had enough time, and my blase attitude was getting them worried. Then they had some debate on whether to call it DCIS or IDC, and settled for DCIS. By then, I was totally pissed off at righty, I told them, just cut it off. So, by the time they cut it off and did the lab- work on it, I had 10cm of DCIS, with 3mm of IDC. They really had to struggle to find it, but with 10cm of tissue to work with, it was almost surely there (I know my statistics).",

Blood draw Monday morning and plastic surgeon appt in the city. Patient education Tuesday morning, and port installation in the afternoon in the city. Wednesday meet with onco and get first infusion in the city. Routine chiro appt in town on Thursday, and we can discuss posture and equal weight hanging off both sides of my chest. I am just eager for this whole thing to settle down to a routine, instead of running to LaCrosse every day. I have to go to the city the day after Christmas, too, for an infusion. Hopefully a spot in the infusion clinic in town will open up for me quickly. Nanette, I will tell you next week if it does that for me. Somewhere in the recommended reading, it suggests using plastic spoons and forks. Went roaming, and I am crocheting a cap from http://www.knotsoflove.org/patterns . My cousin is sending me some of her caps that she used two years ago. The one I am doing is in grey and silver yarn, I am quieter, I imagine I will have fun with some from her package, but I need to express myself.

I went to the local barber, who gave me a nice cut, but told me (mercilessly, as expected) that I have too many bald spots to display it. He was very gentle with the tender areas. This morning I wet my hands and rubbed them around and came away with hair all over my hands. I am hoping to have some left to peek out from under my hats, but no unrealistic expectations. I have knit four hats, bought one, made a kerchief, and bought fabric for another kerchief. Three of my knitted ones have buttons or pins for bling. Now I need to look at the Mary Kay catalog to address the reason why I need so much bling.",

Except a friend called me to tell me that her favorite store has coats for 30% off. Not much of a selection left, but she was willing to buy me one. I had been intending on going to Goodwill, but I couldn't turn down a deal like that. Back story. I was living in a poor area of town ten years ago, and a neighbor died of an OD. Her sister gave me her leather jacket. I have been wearing it for years. Even had it dry cleaned. It was looking ratty, and holes were breaking out in the upper back, where it had been hung up. So I got a new silvery white coat (washable), to go with my grey and silver hat. It has a nice hood, and feels warm, but enough room under for a hoodie to prevent real chills. Once I got that, I made another scarf, this one a yard, with a flamboyant knot at the back. Multi-color batik. Then I crashed, and woke up with a nosebleed.",

The improvement is impressive. My denim purse had to go, too. Got a backpack-style one that looks nice with the coat. Is there any kind of eyedrops that reduces the stinging and burning that might be associated with minimal eyelashes?",
