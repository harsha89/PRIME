I took Claritin for 3 days but I am going to ask my Onc on Monday if I can take it longer as the bone and muscle pain was pretty uncomfortable. Taste and appetite are not great. I have a constant stomach ache. I find it hard to fall asleep at night with the discomfort. I am also combatting a rash on the back of my neck and my scalp is itching like crazy! This wakes me up at night too! Just feeling crappy/weary/tired and down. Tears have been flowing recently at the realization at what lies ahead. OK vent session over. No more feeling sorry for myself! I find a good cry or two pulls me out of feeling crappy sometimes. The positive moments have been that I have managed to get out and run 3 times this week. Being a runner for a very long time I feel most like myself and free from everything when I do this. I am slow but I find it brings me back to me even if I pay for it in fatigue after. Even better my daughter Emma was selected amongst 15 applicants to Stage Manage the High School Musical at her school. She is so happy and proud and I am so glad she has had a positive and happy moment this week. Counting the days until my other daughter comes home from college for Thanksgiving as she is a Freshman at GW and I miss her terribly. JNKK did I read you had rashes too? Tigerlily sending love to you. You made it through chemo and I am so inspired. To ALL OF YOU, Love, Peace, and Strength. <3 XO",

I slept well after taking melatonin to counteract some of the steroid buzz. When I woke I expected to feel some nausea but thankfully it was not present. I took advantage of the lasting energy from the steroids and took a 3 mile run this morning. I saw my nurse this afternoon for my neulasta shot(taking claritin to counter bone pain) and she said to be on watch for the nausea tonight through next Friday. I have my pills on hand for those first signs so I can counter the blow. I have been eating to keep things in my stomach and drinking a TON of water. Feeling tired tonight, with some occasional mild/moderate stomach cramping/pain but nothing that is too overwhelming. I ordered some scarves and hats tonight and trying to decide if I will purchase a wig at the end of the week for the days I feel like I want to have hair. More than anything I am savoring every minute I feel good. Never realized how much I took for granted the power of a good minute. To everyone on their last round, first, second, and then some, I am in awe and so grateful to read all of your posts. I see through all of you that I will get through this when I read all of your stories. The good, the bad ...all of it. A struggle beyond what anyone would wish for but it can be conquered. Big hug to each and every one of you. Positive vibes and love always to each and every one of you. I truly believe it helps.",

The fear is beginning to subside and now I just want to get this all started. Hope I can sleep tonight. I feel so good right now and cannot imagine feeling like crap for the next twelve weeks. I know I can do it after seeing all the support and strength on this page.",
