No real pain anywhere but under the arm where they took out the nodes and that's only when I move. I did stay on top of the pain meds through the night but have switched over to just plain Advil this morning and so far so good. I also have a round of antibiotics. Apparently the original biopsy area was infected which explains the body aches and 4 days of constant sweating last week! My daughter had a cold and I just assumed I was fighting one off to. I never had a fever and the area was never hot to the touch but it was definitely not healing well so they reopened the area and cleaned it up. Thankfully they did the excision from another angle on that side. I may also be allergic to latex which is a new one to me! They used glue to close all my incisions so no stitches to remove either! GLUE! Seems so odd LOL! The positive news form the surgery was that my nodes were soft which is a good sign. We still don't know until pathology results which are expected as early as Friday. For those sweating the shots for the nodes, mine was painless! I asked the tech about that and she said there are different styles so that could be why some feel it more. I was numbed before hand and she only did one shot just under the skin. I didn't even realize she had given it yet! I also had a guide wire placed and again no pain at all. For all my stress and worry it was a relatively easy day physically, emotionally of course I was a wreck and really didn't need to be! Hopefully hearing this will help with a few others nerves for their upcoming surgeries!!  ReadyAbout thinking about you today and hoping for just as smooth a day as I had!",

I had my first appt with the MO this morning. He has nothing to offer me, no hormones, no chemo etc. Just close monitoring for the next few years as far as he is concerned. He did make me stop by the surgeons office for the hematoma/seroma as he thought they might want to drain it. My sweet surgeon ran across the hospital to meet me between surgeries to take a look. She decided less is more in my case. She didn't want to introduce anything new and potentially risk an infection on that side again. So we are watching closely and it gets any bigger I'm to call her through the weekend. She's on call so she'll meet me and drain at that point. Fingers crossed that's not happening! From there I walked down to the Radiation department. I really like the RO, he's got a great personality, great manner etc. Made me feel very comfortable as did his entire staff. We talked, I explained a couple of dates for trips we had coming up and he assured me I'd be finished in plenty of time! He even decided to go ahead and do my first scan and setup right then and there instead of making me wait another week. So I'm all marked up now. I'll go back on Wednesday for another simulation and then off we go. I'm going to do the condensed version and see how it goes. He doesn't think I'll have any issues at all. Said my biggest complaint will probably exhaustion the week after I'm all finished. His end goal though is to make sure we make it to our big summer family vacation to celebrate being done! The constant fear and waiting on what's coming has been worse than any of the actual procedures or appointments! I can't believe I can see an end date in my future KWIM??!?!",

At least I think that's what I am understanding from her. It's simply the type that I had is not expected to have any hormone receptors I guess. I am back at my first day of work today. Of course this morning I woke up and was having my cup of matcha and started feeling this shooting pain in the incision on my left side. I went to rub it to see if that would help it and its a hard lump there now UGH!! Freaked out of course as it was really the first night I slept without a bra on as the Dr said there should be no restrictions at this point and I hate sleeping with one!! So my first thought was stitches were popping. It swelled so quickly and was bulging a bit at the incision site. Iced and then heated as we were googling to figure out what was going on. It's either a seroma or a hematoma :-( I called the nurse this morning and she agreed. I really thought I was home free dang it!!

My one arm was going numb and you just can't move so my advice is make sure your comfy! Once they had my placed they used a grid on the side and ran a couple of scans to find the exact spot. Then the Radiologist numbed the area and used the grid to locate the right spot and do the biopsy. I felt absolutely nothing and heard a very soft vacuum like sound. I think she took maybe 6 samples and I only know that because they were talking not because I felt it at all. They also placed a marker so that my surgeon would be able to find the spot later. They used glue to close me up and that was pretty much it. All in all I was in the machine maybe 30 minutes tops and most of that was positioning and letting the glue dry. My results were back the next day, thankfully benign and just a papiloma that we will remove anyway as a preventative. I was a little sore and swollen feeling the next day but nothing more than a bruised feel. I still have the glue on a week later and its turned to that ugly green bruise color now but no pain. Two things I didn't know, wear a supportive sports bra and they wanted me to lie back and rest for the day while icing. Thankfully I was working from home that day so was able to work and kind of lie back in my recliner with my laptop but honestly I could have come into the office and been fine. I had a planning meeting that evening and had no problems attending etiher.",

Felt the area filling up and a throbbing pain early this morning. It's similar in size, a small lime! It's actually on the left side where they removed a tiny papilloma so it's on the top of my breast but I can also feel it from the side a little where they did the biopsy. I'm assuming the area had more trauma to it since it was touched twice? I was wondering if I should workout tonight or not so if you are I'm going for it! My surgery was minor I think compared to most! Just the lumpectomy/nipple-ectomy and sentinel node on the right and lumpectomy (I guess?) on the left. I took the pain meds the first night out of fear but stopped after the second dose and switched to Advil. Honestly I had permission to go back to work the next day if I needed to but they recommended 2 weeks if I could. I'm glad I took the 2 weeks to just rest since I had so much going on with the kids that second week! I'm grateful for how well I'm feeling but could use a little nap under my desk right now ;-)",
