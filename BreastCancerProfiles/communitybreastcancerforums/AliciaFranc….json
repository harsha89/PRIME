Mainly I know not to expect definitive answers. If they do find something suspicious the next step is a biopsy and that's the only thing that will determine anything definitive. The doctor didn't explain that to me.  I had my partner feel around tonight and she felt a lump. It's in the same sore spot as the doctor hit so I'm certain it's the one he felt too. That made me feel better as it least means I'm not crazy, there is something there.",

      "Content": "Jul 29, 2013 05:56PM - edited Jul 29, 2013 05:58PM by AliciaFrances Thanks to both of you.  Yes, the more I think about it the more bothered I feel, as if the ultrasound tech brushed me off. She didn't explain anything, including what would happen during the U/S (my first one, i'm 32 for God's sake) or why I was having that first/then instead of the mammogram the radiology dept. referred me for. I like the OB/GYN clinic where I got checked out but this test was at a different hospital. And when the gynecologist referred me to the radiology dept. to schedule this they (radiology) specifically said they need to do BOTH a mammo and U/S. [I assumed in that order because that's the natural order I've seen most women go through.] Confirmed over the phone, confirmed when I got there and signed in at the breast clinic.   The tech wasn't outright rude but she was clearly tired and told me I was her last appointment of the day. She asked me to confirm my name and birthdate and then ten seconds later asked me again because she'd forgotten. She spent about ten minutes only swiping in the 12 to 4 o'clock area of the breast. I don't know what's standard so I don't know if they're supposed to do the whole boob because I've never had this done before. The only thing she asked during the exam was where the mass was and I felt stupid because I didn't feel it. My partner and doctor had and neither of them were in the room. I actually thought she'd found something because she spent so long in one spot but she didn't say anything, just went and consulted with the radiologist and then sent me on my way. ",

He went over the ultrasound results and said he was sorry the tech seemed dismissive but that it shouldn't affect the test results. He did another physical exam and couldn't find the mass he'd found before, but as my left breast is still swollen and misshapen (gone up an entire cup size) and it's stayed the same even through my menstrual cycle, he admitted he didn't really know what was going on. So he gave me a referral to a breast surgeon, which I'm really happy about.  I still have to wait two weeks to get in to see her, but I'm just very excited that he didn't dismiss my symptoms based on the ultrasound results. My worry was that he wouln't find the mass again and based on the U/S results just say, \"Well, must've been mistaken\" and tell me to sit on it for six months. It's refreshing to have a doctor who wasn't afraid to admit that he didn't know everything and not hesitate to refer me to someone who does.  ",

She was in and out in under five minutes (after I waited for an hour). She gave me a physical exam and while doing so said, \"I think you're going to have to buy some new bras.\" I couldn't tell if she was joking or what so I didn't say anything. She also made a comment about me being 32 and having a \"growth spurt.\" When she was done with the physical she then repeated that I should get some new bras and get them to match the bigger breast and just pad out the other one.  I asked why my one breast would grow so suddenly overnight and she said, \"We don't know, it just happens. Come back in six months and if it's still the same I can give you a referral to a plastic surgeon and he can make one bigger or one smaller.\" Then she left.  It all happened so quickly my partner (who was in the room) and I were kind of gobsmacked, especially after the plastic surgeon comment. I wasn't there for cosmetic reasons, I was there because one boob suddenly grew and I'm not on BC or any other medication, it wasn't affected by my menstrual cycle, I hadn't gained weight (in fact I'd lost about ten pounds recently) and I doubt a lot of women in their 30's have random growth spurts that affect one breast. And even though my other doctor found a mass that he then thought went away, my breast hasn't gone down. In short, I didn't get any answers from this woman and I was a bit shocked at her flippancy. If it's just my hormones, great, but I would like to know what kind of hormonal inbalance would cause one breast to grow and if so, should I see an endicrinologist or something to get it taken care of? Is there something else, a cyst or an infection that could cause it? Just a very disappointing experience.  ",

I guess that's reassuring but on the other hand, not too much. I know that something is still wrong and now I'm worried my fears won't be taken seriously because the US was clear.  The tech didn't do the entire breast, just the one side and top where I thought the lump might be. [No underarm at all. I don't know what's standard so I'm just noting that.] She kept asking me where it was and I had to tell her I wasn't sure it was because my doctor and partner felt it, I didn't. That made me really frazzled because I felt like I was doing something wrong. But how was I supposed to know? I thought the doctor would've made a note of position or something (but all he put on my paperwork was mass in my left breast). I was trying to zone out when he was examining me because it hurt. My cousin who was diagnosed with BC in her 30s had dense breasts and so I was warned that might indicate it runs in my family (plus there's my age). However, I don't know if I do because the ultrasound tech didn't say anything. i thought at first she might have seen something because she kept going over and over a certain spot. She didn't say anything during the scan though. Just left, consulted with the radiologist then came back and said they didn't see anything and the radiologist didn't think I needed a mammogram and to follow up with my doctor about the soreness and swelling.  All in all, frustrating because I'm back to square one. The doctor who did my breast exam has gone on summer vacation so my follow-up isn't scheduled for a few weeks. I think tomorrow I'm going to call the OB/GYN clinic and see if I can see one of his associates sooner. It won't hurt anything to have a second doctor do a physical exam and take a look at the scans. I want someone to check out my lymph nodes anyway because there's soreness there but neither the original doctor or the ultrasound tech checked them out. ",

Yes, I agree.  This surgeon was in the same cancer center that I had the imaging so I'm going to try and find someone who is NOT associated there. (Which may be hard, it's the big cancer center in town.)  Petitegal, an OB/GYN is who I went to first and who thought he found a mass. My partner really likes her OB/GYN (who's in the same practice as the guy I saw) so I think what we're going to do is schedule an appointment with her. ",
