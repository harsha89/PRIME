Getting up from a recliner or bed was very difficult indeed, had to have my hubby help me, thank God he was able to stay at home with me for 3 weeks.  We both plan to go back to work on Jan 5.  The first week was the hardest, after that, getting up and around was easier.  I slept in a recliner for several nights, then tried the bed with lots of pillows.  It was nice to be back in my bed, but the recliner was stilll  easier to work with and I still spend part of the night in one.  I wake up around 4am and cannot get comfortable, so move to the den and my trusty recliner. My surgeon said because my cancer had not spread, (it was High Grade DCIS) I would not need chemo or radiation, but wants me to take Tamoxifen.  I did not have the oncotype test but am Hormone Receptor Positive.  The surgeon removed the Sentinal Node and one more node, but both were negative. I think I will ask my oncologist about it when I see him on the 7th.  I wish you all well with your surgeries and recovery.  By the way, can anyone tell me how long you have to be off work after the reconstruction phase  with silicone implant plus reduction/lift of the healthy breast?",
