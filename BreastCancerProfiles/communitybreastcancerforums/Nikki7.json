I had an ultrasound yesterday and was already able to pick up the report. The report says, \"I'll-defined thick walked complex cystic mass measuring 1.1 cm. several small nodes are seen in the right axilla. A necrotic benign or malignant neoplasm should be considered. Bi rads 4. It just doesn't sound good to me so I'm scared and can think of nothing else. I had initially had an appt with my breast doctor on March 6th but they called after the ultra sound and moved my appointment up so that scares me even more. Does this sound like it could be breast cancer? Thank you so much for any help!!! Nikki Log in to post a reply",
