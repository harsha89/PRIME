My paternal grandmother, her two daughters, and my sister all developed breast cancer (my sister tested negative for the BRCA mutation). I pushed my results out of my mind the best I could, but I always remembered that the results of my test indicated a 50% chance of breast cancer by age 50 (and a staggering 87% by age 70). When I went to my gynecologist 2 years ago with complaints of never-ending bleeding, pain, and anemia, she diagnosed me with fibroids and adenomyosis. She sent me to see a surgeon, a gynecological oncologist. After speaking with him and learning of his experience with attending to women with ovarian cancer, I decided to have an oopherectomy/hysterectomy. He performed the surgery laparoscopically, using the DaVinci surgical system. I was back at work in three weeks, and I'm glad to have it done. I turn 50 next month, and I have scheduled a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. I'm a little nervous, but I'm glad that I won't have to constantly worry if each test I have will be \"the one.\"",
