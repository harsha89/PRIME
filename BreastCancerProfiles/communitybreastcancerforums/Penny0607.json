I'm a 5-year BC survivor (bone mets at the time of my initial diagnosis, but only in my hips.) The disease has progressed, but slowly. I am switching from Herceptin and the chemo drug Gemzar to Tykerb (alone, no Xoloda.) I haven't tolerated chemo very well. (Gemzar was not my friend.) I was hoping to limit the S/E by switching to Tykerb. My onc is a bit concerned about my weight (I'm underweight) but she's played down other issues. I plan to take all your wonderful advice about when to take the medication and what to eat, etc. (Thank you.) But now I'm a bit scared. Is there anyone out there who is tolerating this drug well???",
