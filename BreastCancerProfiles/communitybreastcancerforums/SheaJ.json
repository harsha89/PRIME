I stopped him and said if it is cancer in left and pre cancer in right should we be looking at removing them both?  He said if I was willing it was a good decission. so I re met with the surg scheduled a double masectomy with reconstruction with TE. Had the surg 1-18 went well work with a large hemotoma on the right. was in hospital 5 days had a very low blood count and need a blood transfusion 2 units the debated on a third. discharged with 2 drains left was removed at 2 1/2 weeks right one is still in an continues to produce between 50-70 in a 24 hr period , PS wants it below 30 to remove it. the site is so uncomtortable and a time bleads. the hemotoma has gone down some but is still large. PS says they will not need to expand the right side as the hemotoma did that already. I go weekly for the left to be expanded and hope that they will remove the right tube. has anyone had tube remove higher than 30?  nervous waiting on the oncotype dx to see if I need chemo. Oh ya good thing I did the double path cam back cancer n both and the cancer in the right was not in the area that they were biop. the right one was small the one on the left was 1.7 stll not that large but they said to close to 2 which would be chemo. 5 nodes on the left all ok 1 node on right ok so now I wait ride the rollercoaster, take pain meds, pray and read these boards. Thank You for being Here!",

The hemotoma is growing and gettin harder. the visiting nurse is coming in again today. Think I am ging to have to go back to the PS and eith have it aspirated or one of the other things he said may ned to happen is he my need to take me back into the er and vacumm the hemotoma out. Nothing has  been added to this side except the TE during surg and it is the size of half a cantalopue.",

It started on the thurs before my right side reconstruction that on the 25th I has to have surg to have the hemotoma evacuated, well it started to get pink and I started to drip from the drain hole and small Ooze from the incision. By Sat night it was red, hot painful ooze that had a smell. Called ps sun first thing he called in antibiotics and made an appointment for me for Monday. Went in Monday not good sent to infectious disease they said I need an ultra sound with an aspiration of the fluid. But all the radiologist that do that prose endure we're go for the day. The radiologist said continue your oral antibiotics and come back tomorrow for the aspiration. I said the ID and PS will not like this you need to talk to them they want me on IV antibiotics today. So after they conferenced they redid the ultra sound marked the site and cave the coordinates to the PS and he aspirated 60 cc of fluid. Just that helped on the pain. Then the sent me to infusion for the IV antibiotics. PS told me not to eat anything after midnight he was adding me onto the surg list for tomorrow if it did not start to improve. So Tue morning it was lighter more pink than red but still hot and painfull. he called me in the morning said he would rather schedule me than have be as an add on and if it was not worse..... He then when on to explain that then infection had compromised the TE and it had to be removed. So Wed. I had surg and the TE was removed I am still on daily IV antibiotics at the infusion center ( re- evaluation today) have to was at least 6 weeks for right side to heal before that can put another TE in. I am frustrated, depressed and trying to find the good... I am holding on to the fact that at least I do not have to have chemo! I teach and advise on a college campus I thought I would be back in 4 weeks it has been 2 months today. I'm still having physically therapy to get my arm motion and strength back! I thought I had researched and planned..... So much for best laid plains! AND can you believe our dog was diagnosed with type 3 mast cell cancer they same week I was called back in for my mamo... Here's is terminal and she is not doing so well right now but trying to be happy and there for me! Guggenheim I need to stop I could go on and on. Thank you for listening.",

PS said next week they would start pumping up that expander well it started to swell with fluid again and is larger that the left one again (left has been being pumped up) and last night it started leaking out both the old drain site and at the insission. They left the stitches in for an extra week. uggg. only good news is that I was told this week that my oncotype dx was an 8, so no need for chemo I will be put on femara for 5yrs. question does anyone else doubt good news and wonder did someone make a mistake? I'm just not sure what to trust anymore.",
