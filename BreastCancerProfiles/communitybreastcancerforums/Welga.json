Here it is only approved for colon cancer.  Also I know you mean well Beesie but I had to wait a month for my pathalogie repor, so for waiting times you cannot say Canada because, here in Quebec reports take time and are nerve consuming.

Here we are covered by public system we do not need private insurance, this is surely good but then the wait in some part of the province is just too long and I hope they find a way to solve this problem soon.   Welga",

Some supplements also help to reduce the aches, magnesium citrate, fish oil and others.

After you can if you need add 1 mg per week and find your right amount. They are a bit like antidepressant in the sense that the 1rs week is the hardest then your body gets used to it. If 3mg is too strong start with a lower dose, it really works, good luck, Welga",

What good is looking at only a piece of 1/2'' of skin. Incredible. Here we have several doctros that went private and are out of the system and some of them take patients for only one consult even if they never had them before. I guess walk in clinics are not an option if they are congested like ours. Don't give up, it's a hasell but for your own peace of mind. Sometimes what I did also is book myself for a mamo (when I had breast) even though I did not have the doctor's refence yet telling them I had one, since we only got to show them when we go to the appointment, so that made a shorter wait.
