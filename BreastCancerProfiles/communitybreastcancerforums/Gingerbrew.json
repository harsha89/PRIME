My DD went to appointments with me and took notes and was immensely helpful. Keeping track of her meds and when taken. Side effects when and how, food needs. foods that will help with treatment for example. Keeping enough toilet paper in the house, paper toels and in my case we used hand sanitizer too. You will be able to do all of this for your mom if it meets her needs. Just being there with a cool cloth for her forhead or a fresh pillow will be a comfort.

I had to end early due to neuropathy in my hands and especially my feet. I still have it but am hopeful it will go away. It makes it far to easy for me to fall over because I can't feel, what I can't feel. i.e step on one foot with the other and don't know exactly why I can't move my foot and wham I spin around and blammo I am face down on my couch.  I am super fair and already have some sort of skin breakdown under my affected boob.  I am mostly nervous about skin breakdown and burning badly.I just read on here about putting a panty liner onder my boob and it is agreat idea. If I can keep it dry I think it will help alot. I had a shingles injection just before chemo and am glad I did.  My friend got it during chemo and it was really hard on her. Get your shot if you can. Chemo was very difficult for me and I can't imagine shingles on top of that. I just found out that there is this group, I had read some on the dec group this past week and found it hekpful. It is good to be able to come somewhere and be with people in the same treatment. I think these BCO boards are wonderful!  GInger",

It was very simple, pretty quick and the single additional tattoo I needed didn't hurt one tiny bit. I think my boob is numb in that area.  I need to lay on my side for those but just for a single ray, so although it isn't how I would choose to sleep it is manageable. MY anxiety about going to treatment has not lessened. Now I find my self tapping my teeth a little as some sort of distraction from how I must be feeling. I don't consciously feel anxious but my behavior tells me I must be. I was much better functioning during chemo, I just did it and took the medicine. I didn't feel  like I was having a breakdown. Now I have missed five appoints, go late, can't leave the house in time even though my time is the afternoon.  Now Iam having night terrors, sleeping 13 or more hours, clicking my teeth, singing little tunes or get this clicking my teeth to familiar tunes such as jingle bells. I am going to have an appointment with a psychiatric oncology worker to try to sort this out. I only have 18 to go, I will use whatever help I can to get me to where I need to be.   I went to be at 8:30 with a sleeping pill but didn't sleep so I got back up at twelve thirty.  I love you all GInger",

I asked why I needed to see the doc when things were going okay and I was told my Rads would not be covered if I didn't see the Doc. He also has to check the exray and the rads alignment(?) too. I wonder if your billing is going to show that you did see him. If it was my Doc I would want out of there if he was compromising himself in one area I would wonder where else he might.     I don't know exactly why but the idea of a RADS Doc doing anything at all unethical makes me really furious. Perhaps because we are totally in their hands and because it is all something we can't even see.  I hope this isnt the case for you Rachel. If it is I would report so that you are not a victim twice. I am sure others here would know the best way to report. I personally would not address it to his staff since this is something he already does.

At my house there is still snow on every tree branch, the lawns and even on the paved parking area in front of the house. I had to be especially careful going to the main highway because our road has about 1/2 mile of curves next to a ravine. My husband even had someone spin out in front of him this AM on the main road.

You should know you will not be the first person to have these issues. Ask the techs to show you how you could open the door from the inside if you needed to. Have them show you the telephone in the room you could use to call out with if you needed to. Ask them if they have a camera connection into the room where they can see you to know you are okay,  and as if they have a two way intercom that they can speak to you throughout your treatment. Have them show you how you could get off of the table by yourself if you should need to do so.  All of these things will give you back your power. I think knowing you could choose to stop treatment is also powerful. I of course hope you will weigh the pros and cons and continue the best treatment path for you.

Specifically!    It might feel good, safe, simpler, to feel that the Doctors are in charge but the reality is that you are.   I don't know who told you at a University that your Doctor was so highly thought of that \"they\" wouldn't treat you but that is bogus. Doctors get hired and fired every single day, it is part of their job, they are like independent contractors in so many ways. You don't hire every plumber or keep a plumber who is screwing up your plumbing do you?   Be bold we are all with you.  It doesn't matter if they like you, you will not get better medical care because they like you. In fact a little fear on the part of the professional staff will keep them on their toes.  Said as much for myself as for you. Ginger",

I had not yet cried after finding out I had cancer and needed the stereotactic biopsy for further info for the doc. After not crying for the 5 days since I had gotten my news all of a sudden I decided to cry during this test. In retrospect it was funny because I was sort of sobbing and my surgeon (who did the test herself) is trying to getthis done properly and I am shaking with sobs with my boob down in the area it needed to be. The nurse who stood by me helped me hold my breath between sobs. So while I was a bit of a basket case on that particular day it all went well. I am over weight and was concerned about not being able to get in position, but the tech helped me very kindly and never made me fell like I was embarassing myself.  You can do this, if I can do this!  Actually, please don't cancel. This info will help your surgeon do a better job, and if you have cancer you need to get it out of you, or alternately shrunk down first, but still, on the way out of you. Please don't do anything to delay your best treatment plan. Cancer is the enemy and you want it gone!  Hugs, and lots of encouragement coming your way! Ginger PS I didn't find this test painful, only a pinch for the numbing. ",

We painted ceramics, had ice cream, went to a book store where a lady blessed me. (that was weird for me but I know she meant well and I will take all the blessings I can get.) I must look pretty unusual with my pre gathered scarf on.  Scans, I have had only the Mugga scan.  Newlasta,  give myself my Newlasta injection in the side of my pudge, sort of lower waisline.  Chemo Brain Last night I could not remember where we put our dirty clothes!  We have a huge three bag stainless laundry sorter thingy with a hanging rack. It is impossible to miss and I couldn't even begin to think of it until morning. Neuropathy Fingers and toes. Hope it doens't increase, it is annoying and fingers hurt a little in addition to the tingling.  Rants Rants can bring you validation on this board. I say rant away as needed ladies. Discovery of lump until 1st chemo. I thought my schedule had been compromised because I had surgery in Illinois and then chemo in Seattle. I now can see I was treated very speedily and began chemo way way ahead of many of you. Perhaps my tight schedule induced the Docs to get me in when I was there.I found the lump on friday night May 21 saw the doctor on Monday May 24th. Left for Seattle to find  house on the 25th, Found out I had cancer on the 27th while in the car with the realtor. Had a sterotactic biopsy on June 2nd and lumpectomy on June 7th. My friend and her daughter help with packing. Then get on an airplane with two cats, a dog and my husband on July 10th.   I arrived  in Seattle on July 10th and had big Doctor Clinic appointment here on the July 13. That is the app where all of your doctors meet, review all of your records, all examine you together, then they meet again, decide on treatment and then each one meets with you individually and they record it all for you to play beck as needed. This is a 4 hour appointment and worth every second.  My chemo began on August 2. Our furniture arrived on July 28th, Our daughter had a c section on August 13 due to placenta praevia and all went perfectly. Beautiful new granddaughter.  May 21st find lump, August 2nd begin chemo.  I have my chemo, #3 on Tuesday, blood draw at 12:30 P.M., Doc at 1:30 P.M., and chemo at 5:30 to 9:30 P.M. This is not the schedule of my dreams for sure.  I got lost last time I left the hospital trying to get back on the freeway. I do not want to do the Seattle tour again, especially in the dark.. There was no learning from my last tour because I don't know where the entrance is where I finally got on. I learn a lot on the message board. I don't always post but I do read every single post every day.   ",

It turns out the because the BC patients are the largest group we get lower priority in scheduling. WTH is that. I can see giving little kids earlier appointments but this was plain rediculous. I will be complaining to those who have any authority in the matter. Otherwise I was told I am doing very well and rather htink I am myself. I do tend to always sound healthier than I feel.  If you recall I had a week off of Chemo and that was because me granddaughter was here along with my son. Wonderful life enrichiung monents of time.  My WBC was more than recovered, over 10. I took my Newlasta shot on Wednesday 24 hours after my tuesday infusion. The only side effect so far is my face and neck are a bit red. NO bone pain!    For Callamity I feel you, going off of the steroids each time gives me a bad feeling. This time we are trying to taper off and I just picked a bitof a fight with my husband which I rarely ever ever do. Strange.  My MIL leaves for home tomorrow and my husband goes back to his travel scehdule which is the toughest part of this all. I was used to him on 100% travel for the last year and now it was so wonderful to have him home since July. I have laways dealt with it but really don't want to this time.  Great news on the clear head scan, woo hoo for you.  I think of you all alot! i do adore reading the \"you know you have cancer whhen\" page so much. I need the laughter it brings no matter how far fetched it seems it always fits.  Love you all.  PS My second round of 4 DD will be taxol and they will give me benadryl because they say a lot of women have a bad reaction to TAXOL. I was however told there is no nausea with it.  My new granddaughter is 4 weeks old today! Hoorah for life. ",

If your scalp has no abrasions you should be good to go. Remember to do the allergy test before every color application.I don't know why chemo would have changed our allergic reactions, but just to be safe. Don't over process, use product you are used to already. Perhaps someone knows of a reason why not to color, but I can't think of one. Children in film and TV sometimes have permanent color treated hair so they make a better family unit.The ones I know had no harm from the treatment.  You all know your hair is dead, right? Yes, long ago before college I was a hairdresser.  I think I will try to get my straggly wispy bits down closer to my scalp, it looks so awfully bad.  Oh Halloween, we are remote here.

I will lose my big toe nail and the one next to it.  My finger nails look perfectly fine and I hope I keep them, they aren't fancy but look normal. Isn't it funny how attractive normal and average have become! . My skin has also become dryt, I have had oily skin all of my life, of course I lifed in the humid midwest. I can't understand how Seattle is drier but apparently it is. I have now lost  7 pounds since the chemo  began. I don't mind that at all. My skin looks bad though.  I feel pretty good today, 22 mg of dexamethazone will do that for a girl. :)  Calamity glad your chemo went well. Hope you beat the pain SE.

My husband had to have purchased them, they are silver sparkle. Carolyns daughter would love them!    This will be nail number three and I finished chemo in November! I can see two more that are showing the early signs of not being fully attached. I wonder if I will lose them all now? This will not be a summer for sandals. My fingernails each have a line across them that must denote when I started or stopped chemo. I surely hope that is all it means. The nailbeds just don't look right either, more white than pink. I had this bright idea yesterday to put Emu oil on my toenails and feet.  My 2 cats came running to me and trying to lick my feet. They have never, ever done anything like this before. It finally dawned on me that Emu's are birds and I might as well have smeared chicken fat on my feet.  I see my MO next wednesday and then get my port removed next thursday. I look forward to it being gone.  I am probably going to get the Arimidex RX then. I pray I can take it with no big SE's. I already have knee pain, sport injuries as a kid and some arthritis now.

You could seal off the open wound area. Maybe? Hair color. L'oreal Preference  is a good one step colour. Remember you can only go a couple shades lighter than your natural color without an additional bleaching step.  If you want to play a little, and are interested in red, you could do that quite easily. I would advise that you stay away from any of the purple reds. They tend to age the wearer even if they are young like you are. Back when I had red hair I would mix Flame and Sun Bronze half and half. It worked well on my medium dark brown hair giving me a believable red.  This is much lighter than you probably want but because you have dark hair it is necessary to bring you up to a good red. You put it on the ends first and then go to the roots putting it all over. Putting a plastic bag on (not over haha)  your head helps keep it warm and bring the color up a little faster. A rinse well and then shampoo with a colour conserving shampoo like Aveda or other.  Your hair is currently so short that you could just put it all over and let it work for about 35 minutes. Have great fun with this. You can color over it easily to go back dark and with hair cuts it will be a fun summer memory.  I was tempted to try some pink. I was last pink when I was 20 years old. :) ",

I sort of would like to go but I know the hours my husband works and I would be on my own. I have gone to Haiti alone 7 times but had a place to go to and people I knew to work with. Being a tourist alone doesn't sound like such a bad idea to me but I think I am too afraid of food poisoning and parasites just now. I have been in a Haitian Hospital for 7 or 8 days and wouldn't like to repeat that in India. So I called my husband and encouraged him to go, maybe he'll have some time on the weekends to sight see a bit. When I went to England with DH in 2004 he had exactly one day to sight see out of two weeks and worked till 10:00 or midnight everynight. When clients get him to their site they want all the knowledge he has poured out onto them!    I don't know how he continues to be able to do this. I would be so exhausted.  Sorry babbling on..... Omaz, Sweeny and Lizzy especially,  yes I am going to step back from the organization I am involved in. I am going to ask the board to allow me to be less active, to attensd fewer meetings , perhaps one a quarter and to be in an advisory role until or if I am feeling healthy again. I realize a large part of the problem is me, I put a great deal of pressure on myself to properly carry out our statement of incorporation which calls for educating the public about water needs and solutions in the third world and also to fund raise.  New people have come onto the board and except for funding needs, this is probably an ideal time to step back.  I am gpoing to a big quilt show this Friday with DD and DGD. I think it will be fun. I am so scattered  that I will hardly look at the quilts but at all the gadgets for sale!    Like a state fair, I love all those gadgets and hawkers selling stuff I surely don't need!   We wnet to a Value Village and a childrens resale shop yesterday. I got an unused art book on techniques of the impressionists for $2.30 and a new beautiful baby sleeper for $6.00. I think I will be going back to those stores!  In Chicago I used Value Village for costume pieces and parts and it was difficult to get through the stores. Here the aisles were wide, the lighting was good and EVERYTHING was ORGANIZED! I was amazed.  Laters Ginger",

Thank you so much ladies for your support. It is hard to step back when I know that no matter how I feel most everyone in Haiti is feeling worse. Thinking about the seasons in our lives helps, I am 66 and from 35 on I have worked in social services and then with our clean water mission in Haiti since 2002, first traveling there in 2003. God knew what he was doing to put me there back then, I had gained skills and education over the years that set me up to be the right person to do what I did. I handled going sort of crazy after my first trip there, it broke me down for sure. It also put me on a track that led us to being able to provide clean water on an ongoing basis for thousands of Haitians. I onlyt spent 6 months in country and the rest working here on fundraising and education. Now is the time for others to step forward. As an aside, the trouble wasn't within our US group it was a foreign group who also provided support but wanted to take over based on inaccurate and faulty information. Zillions of meetings and angst later, it is settled. One would think such a thing never happens in missions but it surely does.  Anyhow I will be available for history, support and that sort of thing. I am also an amazingly good resource person after years of case manangement with ho,meless families. I will be able to still have an influence when needed and able to step back most of the time and let others do the work I did. Your advice really helped me to do this, this is a huge change in my life.  I am on a break with anastrozole and hope the SE's subsie and then don't return so strongly when I go back onto it.   Have a good weekend all.

I was able to contribute all the way from the state of Washington via Amazon. We have the no shipping fee option of Amazon so I ordered 1000 pair of heavy duty nitrile black rubber gloves and 26 boxes of heavy black trash bags. They arrived in VA in 2 days.

Oh yeah, anyone working in a shelter maybe pick up a gigantic box of ear plugs. People sleep better then.  Also place a chair next to the mats seniors are sleeping on so that they can get up from the floor.   I am just stunned that our nation is not better equipped for emergencies like this. Why does it take days and weeks to send the needed equipment? Something is just wrong with that. I am glad resources are there now and more are on the way.

So I can see all the ice skaters not just what prime time wants to show. I was very good and did not spill the beans. I will watch the women's short skate this AM and then tomorrow the long skate at 7:30 AM.  I am now at 2 AM watching the ski racers tonight and the half pipe skiers too.   I actually enjoy the elimination rounds because I am able to then see what the difference is between the levels of athletes.   The NBC production values suck!!!! What is this with pushing the pain for the athletes in interviews? It isn't just with Bode Miller, NBC has continued in pushing responses with those who have had ongoing disappointment. I saw a good example of real human response to others pain when a skier was being comforted be his father. The onlookers were averting their eyes, showing compassion and respect. That is real human response. What does NBC think of their viewers to foist such disgusting values on us.  Texas, please check in. Perhaps a friend could let us know how you are doing. Is there any way we could support you?  I will continue to keep you in my prayers.   Lizzy, how is the snow up in CT now? My cousin lives in the Syracuse  area of NY and has mountains of snow.  You  are making a good plan for handling your appt. I get tightly wound just before anything diagnostic.  It is still raining here, day after day. Some of the trees are letting go now and some earthen embankments are collapsing. This happens after these long soakings. Lots of the trees overlap one another and I think this strengthens the stands of trees. ",

I had some incidents of laying in bed crying, especially when coming off of the droids. I agreed to go back on them because there is no way I ever want a major depression again. My shrink during the time of my major and only depression told me to always start antidepressants early because they are more effective and it is more difficult to get out of a major depression. I can attest to that, it was such a hard time, three years of my life. I hope this was helpful Bama GInger",

It goes like this, go to bed at 12 midnight, watch a tv show. Try to fall asleep but don't, think of taking a sleeping pill but then decide I woun't have enough time left to take a pill. So fall asleep naturally and then sleep approximately 12 hours straight through! Me sleep is so screwed up I can hardly believe it. Now my last regular rad is tomorrow and then on Monday I begin boosts, ten of them.  If I did take the Lunesta I have it seems I sleep too long with it but since I sleep too long anyway, once asleep, maybe that is not a valid thought. Does anyone have that experience?  I am so tired of having BC, anyone else? Wouldn't it be great if we could say,\"I am tired of this! Get out of here! I reject you!\"  Maybe that is my problem, I rarely express anger. I honestly don't find too may things to be angry about but this cancer is pissing me off big time!  Love all of you GInger",

We are coming up on seven years here! I am amazed at how fast time has flown. Flown? It was nice to come back here and see some posts. Wonder Woman you did it, YOU ARE IN NURSING SCHOOL!!!!! WA HOO!!! Me, I play dolls with my dear granddaighter who lives only two blocks away since we moved last year. She is six and tells me I need to learn to speak \"doll\" better. I think I break character. I do have a sewing room here, it is super. The house we bought was a flip, a raised ranch and what is the rec room which runs front to back in the house is MINE! It has may sewing tools, my hugs cutting table, my fabrics in bins under the cutting table. The table top in 40\" high and the surface is 48\" x 78\" I just got a new drafting chair for it. The other half of the room has art supplies, craft supplies including a coping saw. Plus all the Muffie dolls, furniture, clothing, props etc. My previous kitchen table and chairs are there along with tall cabinets for the Muffies and open shelving for the other supplies. On the walls I have photos, art pieces that mean something to me. It is a Grandmas play room for sure. IU got it this way by doing something I should have done years ago. I hired an organizer. A miracle has occurred in my entire house. My play room has benefited the most, items are categorized and labeled. My fabrics are in labeled bins ALPHABeTICALLY! That makes me laugh, but it works. My husband was in India for three weeks and brought me back 5 pieces of beautiful silk. I dont know what I am going to do with it yet, but I can find it! My cousin who has had BC over thrty years from In SItu then twenty years later, IDC estrogen dependant like mine has now has it spread to her hip bones and her brain. She just finished Rads and is into chemo, they give her (then) 2 months to a year. Damn this disease, she was always the bold leader of the cousins. There is so much cancer in my family on my fathers side. Me, I have an appointment with the wellness clinic at SCCA and a mammo for the fifteenth. I have an area under the nipple where when I do a breast exam it sort of raises/puffs up and is bumpy so I am getting it checked. It had better not be inflammatory BC or I will be so pissed off. I'll be in touch s I know anything. I look forward to hearing from Timothea, Lady in B, WonderWoman, Wherria, everyone.",

To my surprise I could not stop myself from sliding, nor could I pick myself up. My phone was in the middle of the bed, which I could not reach. My husband was at his office. Two hours later my DH arrived home and after he determined he could not pick my dead weight up gave in and let me dial 911. The EMT's were super and seemed to know right away what was wrong. My oxygen % was low and I was so weak, it had crept up on me I think.  Off to the ER we went and after a bunch of pokes I was admitted with pneumonia on the cardiac floor? I don't know why. I had many more pokes, they were determined to grow some plants in petri dishes. After two days of virtually no sleep I told them that 2 mg of Lorazepam worked for me during chemo. Soooo I was awakened in the night and the nurse was speaking to me and I was answering but I could see her alarmed look. My speech was incoherent and bam I was in the MRI machine and Cat Scan at 3 AM. Nope no stroke, just a reaction to being awakened while on Lorazapam. Back to a floor, a new one, Neurology, I was using the oxygen which I think was restorative but my cough was just as bad and so annoying. The best thing in the hospital was they made Robitussin available and it would hold off my cough. After a few days I was moved to the medical floor in preparation to a move to a physical rehab facility. I am 71 but felt like a youth at this place. I was at the hospital for 11 days and then 6 I think at the rehab. I did not belong at the rehab, I do not need or use a walker. The staff is so used to bed bound people that they treated me as one, it was also a holiday weekend. One staff member actually asked me if I could walk? It was just the wrong place, I do need PT work for my back but not in such a facility. Now I have Home Health Care and I don't need the nursing part or the practical therapy but I will be happy to get the physical therapy going! I think some intake was neglected there and contributed to the bad fit. My cough lingers and I see my DR tomorrow to do some test that will determine if I need to keep using oxygen because of the years I smoked and do I have emphesema. I hope I don,' since I quit over 30 years ago. I still need to goto SCCA and I will chewck back after I get the done. Wonder woman, I think I read something about you wanting to go back to school long ago. Good luck and more power to you! Anyone else hanging around? Check in, I think of you all and wish you only the best in your lives. Hugs Ginger ",

It is my SIL birthday this week and I got him a box of candy from teh 80's since he was born is 76 he is a child of the 80's. I am happy to say he loved it, recognized lots of candy he ate back then. It was a lot of fun to see him and our daughter reminiscing about candy. Haha. I am glad the hair color info was helpful I was a hair dresser before I went to college.  Going too many shades lighter with a one step hair color is probably the most frequent error people make. The other would be going too many steps lighter with a ASH color. The base of ash is green and leaves a less than lovely cast to hair that isn't meant to be ash. Oh yeah, only products with pexoride will lift the color of your hair lighter.  Going a little lighter is usually better than going darker unless you look young and have naturally dark features, eyebrows and such. Since I don't know any of you I will write what I could never say to anyone I don't know really really well. Please highlight you hair if you are primarily grey or white rather than going dark. Coloring light hair dark, if your roots are light, looks bizzare as it grows out. Sort of like a dark wig levitating on ones head. Just sayin in peace and love. Right now my bright white hair looks like I have some sort of weird Grandma too tight perm. I need to get it shaped now because it looks rather like a giant permed bubble cut afro. My hair is curly but never like this, I prefer my hair to be sort of scraggly and I just scrunch out of the shower and don't need to think about it again. Right now my hair is the antithesis of how I like it to look. I couldn't go pink with it like this, it would look like a clown wig. Seriously, a clown wig.   Texas, you are smart to follow up on your transcripts. You will have so much fun going back to college. I totally loved going to college when I was 29. It was one of the high lights of my life. Of course I was there with the returning Viet Nam Vets wihich made it all another level of amazing. SO I have been on the Arimidex for three weeks now. WHen do the hot flashes start? I am getting joint aches, knees mostly, headaches not too much else except on evening of extreme, want to get out of my own skin crankiness.  Lady in Bama, do you know Huntsville? I went there once to Lace Camp with Martha Pullen, we did heirloom sewing and it was alot of fun. Honest a lot of fun!  Love GInger",

We do have a new American Girl Store in Lynnwood. They have all the dolls and even a restaurant. I was there a month ago and your daughter might love to go there. We just need to plan, there is a big fair coming up if you ever make it around that time it would be fun.   re The man on the plane, what a jerk!   lIZZIE HOW ARE YOU DOING? i TOO WONDERED IF YOU ARE NEARLY DONE WITH ALL THE PACKING? sORRY CAPS I hit caps lock all the time and since I don't touch type I make a mess. Lady glad you are done with chemo. My hair is still Bozo like. I think I am used to the anti estrogen meds (name) that we take for five years. Obviously I still have lingering chemo brain. I do not like the hot flashes from the meds,   but I use two fans so they help. The knee pain is no fun and my back aches far too easily. We had our grand daughters first birthday party here on Saturday. It was really nice. We filled a little pool with plastic balls and the little ones liked that a lot. Our SIL smoked a pork roast of some kind and it was wonderful.  I hope everyone is enjoying what is left of summer. I must say it seems harsh to me to send kids back to school in early August. Why? I have one GD in Phoenix, it is so hot there.  Read every word and ccaught up. Glad Kiaran is doing better. I loved the story about Aiden and the use of behaviour mod on all the boys. It works!  Love Barb",

      "Content": "Aug 26, 2010 12:13AM - edited Aug 26, 2010 12:32AM by Gingerbrew Hi everybody, Wherria, I think your dog Bixby is just beautiful. He must haveleft you with lots of good memories.  Go ahead cry in the checkout line if you need to. My dog Ernie died unexpectedly in my arms three years ago and I cry even now as I write this. Our pets are a special gift in our lives and if we did not mourn them we would not be human. Neulasta yes I give myself the neulasta injection. I am distressed this time that my hip still hurts 8 days after.  For thos wondering about self injecting, I find it very simple, quick and actually painless.. OTC MEDS I am treated at a large medical center, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Everytime I come in to see the Doc or the Nurse, this means everytime I get Chemo, I receive a printout of every drug they are gining me, that I am taking prior to treatment and still take and any kind of OTC med, vitamin or herb. The Doc refills whatever I need from the entire list, reviews what I am taking and any changes I might need. For those of you in smaller practices I reccomend you make up your own list so that you can accurately review with your doc. It is so easy to get mixed up with all these drugs on hand and needed for various symptoms. I think the SCCA is simply brilliant in the ways it checks and counter checks what I need and what I am taking. I am continiing to have slightly runny tummy, then not so runny then back to slightly runny and gassy tummy pretty quickly.  I am trying to eat lots of fruits and veggies and might get a bit carried away. I am also eating a little more meat than usual. Home made burgers on the grill so good and I am kind of craving meat in week two once again. I also just discovered PHO a vietnamese noodle soup dish that I eat Veggie with tofu.  So good and gentle too. We get a box of fresh veggies and fruit once a week and it really helps me eat better. HAIR Mine is little wisps now. I think cutting your hair short while you still have it all will be less traumatic than having strands of your beautiful hair drifting everywhere in the house. I had long hair for years and years, old hippie here, and can't imagine losing it so randomly. I also wish I had still had long hair and the ability to donate to lock of love like so many have done. Even giving a braid to your husband is a sweet gift with the right man.  HAT  I have this pink bucket hat with appliqued flowers in the same fabric and color, it is okay I feel sort of normal in it. I have a cotton scarf that is cool and comfortable. Makeup I wish I had a class. I look so facially bald/naked/whited out,  with no hair around my face. Maybe the makeup would help with that. Night and praying for a good night and bright day for all of us who are fighting this fight.  Ginger",

I am on a one week delay for my next chemo because my 7 year old Grand daughter arrives on Wednesday and stays until the 7th. I haven't seen her in nine months and I am so excited. We share a birthday and I had to be messing around in hospitals and such so I couldn't go visit her for our birthdays this year for the first time. She doesn't know I am sick or bald so we will have some talking to do. I got a coloring book for kids about cancer form the SCCA resource center and it is simple and not scary. We will do okay I think. I think she is just wonderful and I am so excited. Did I mention that I am excited. So about me.  I grew up in Chicago, I am an only child and no only children are not selfish. I always knew my things were mine and had no issues about sharing. My husband is the oldest of six and has been known to hide his cookies in his dresser when the kids were still at home. Hah! I loved dance and ice skating when I was a kid. We all played outside a lot, bikes, rollerskates, the metal over your shoe type. We played jump rope, hop scotch, bounced a ball against a wall games, hide and seek, so many more and went in when the street lights came on. My Grandma had a farm in the south and she had no running water or power. I loved going to her farm more than I can express.  I have four grown children, three are married, one has a sports car. He has loaned me his sports car, a Viper, from time to time. It isnt a grandchild but is really a lot of fun. I am an old gear head but I only go really fast out on country highways and limited access roads. We have one grandchild in Chicago, two in Arizona and one brand new, two week old, right here in WA.  I am so happy to be out here with our daughter at this time. I have missed her terribly as she moved to CA after college and we had always been close. Now she has a little girl too and we will all have a great adventure together.  I am married for 32 years to my hardworking, devoted husband. He is trying so hard to be helpful and is doing really well at it. He had a hard time at first, sort of in denial. He had been out of town for all of my first apppointments, He was going to go to work the day of my surgery! He didn't after we had a talk, yeah one of those, \"What are you thinking\" talks that you can have after 32 years of marriage.  He is doing much better now that he has gone to an appointment with me at SCCA and met the Doctor there and I had my first chemo that day. He has also been very kind about my hair.  My degrees are in psychology. I have always worked or volunteered somewhere in social services. Previously in programs for homeless families. Most recently for a mission in Haiti where we make bio-sand water filters. Clean Water For Haiti.org I can write about health care in Haiti another time. I too love to read and love animals. I have two cats and one dog. My special dog died in my arms three years ago after some neighbor kids did something that stopped him from breathing. I was right there and I did cpr to no avail. Even though two vets did a joint autopsy on him we never found the cause. No bleeds, no tumors, no nothing at all that they could find. This was just after my mom died so it was an exceptionally hard time in my life. I am close to ready to get myself another big dog, Ernie was a Golden Retriever and 8 years old.  I bought some art supplies and books and plan to try to paint or something similar.  Where we live now, we just moved here to WA in July, we have a horse barn and fenced pasture. I have invited a local horse rescvue to place a couple horses here if they have someone who can take care of them, I don't know how. I think it would be so wonderful to have horses here, probably just retired old guys who like to hang out together. I think it would make my heart sing. I discovered I had cancer just because I had a slight itch on a friday evening (of course) and when I reached over to scratch it something felt hard. I had to wait till Monday to get to the Doc who saw me immediately and I had 25 momograms, an ultrasound and a biopsy all that day. The next I flew to WA to find a house. Then three days later I got \"the call\" while in the car with the realtor that I had cancer.  Six days later back in Illinois I had the stereotactic biopsy and a week later surgery. Then I moved to Wa a month after that, then three days later had my first appointment at SCCA for all the rest of my treatment.  Woo hoo, it has been one wild ride. Thank God I had a friend living in our house who did a huge amount of the packing. She was an angel when I really needed one.  So thats my story. Theres a lot more because I am twice as old as some of you, 65,  and therefore have more stories.  Love you all Ginger",

I finished the Z pak on friday and the cold is nearly all gone, after three + weeks it had better be!  My fist Taxol will be on October 25th now. I may be able to stop the Neulasta if I go to every three weeks for the Taxol to have time for my white count to rebuild naturally.  I will know on the 25th if I canmake the change. While I dont want to need to go until the end of December I also am so weary of the Neulasta pains. I need to wait to see what the Doc says about the change.  I am so tired and weary, like I am 80 years old.and out of shape.  I broke down and cried yesterday. We were to go out to eat with our DD and her hubby and when we got to their house I was just too ill feeling to go. I had become motion sick on the way over and then just couldn't sit up very well. I stayed behind and slept. I don't usually cry especially where my son in law and DD can see.  I know my labs were all good two weeks ago the day my chemo was cancelled, because they did the labs  before I was cancelled. I want to feel the new normal again and not so wrecked.  I hope this is a time of good turn around, I am ready for it.  Have a wonderful day today and enjoy something you like.  Hugs Ginger",

It was the schedulers error and always was meant to be three hours.  Wer got out pof the SCCA at 10:10 Pm and home in ahalf an hour. I had heebee jeebee legs from the massive amounts of steroids. I took two lorazepam and it doidn't touch it for an hour so I finally was able to go to sleep around 2. I had been laying in bed swinging my arms and legs about. DH was very tired and didn't even notice. Dog was worried about me.  I was able to take one dexamethason yesterday amd and one PM so I am not having a big droid crash.  Doc also insisted I up the effexor I take for the dduration of chemo  becuase my droid crash was so morose. I sure don't want to go up in the Effexor but am willing to if it could circumvent a major clinical depression.  I do not ever want to go down that road again. Get treatment, get it early get back out sooner. I have my Neulasgta on the way, I will take it tomororw. I had forgetten to get the order  going again since I was off sick for a month.  I have only 3 TAXOL left to go. The infusion was okay except for getting hot. I wanted to get my shoes off, my headcovering off, I wanted a fan. My face turned red. I had perspiration on the back of my shirt. None of this was enough to call it a reaction though. My temp only went .4 from 97.4 to 97.8 I run low.  My face is still bright across the cheeks and bridge of my nose. I wonder if that is from the droids yesterday.  Age spots, I watched them disappear during the infusion. Amazing!!!!! On my forearms and hands. Either gone or faded out to fleshtone.  Some of them the top layer simply peeled off. I am exceptionaly fair complected so they really show alot. I have to take a better look at the ones on my neck, I think they faded out too. One visible benefit to chemo, yeah!!!! I also felt well enough to help my DD sort my closet a bit. Remember we moved here in July and are still not unpacked.  It would be so good to b e unpacked. My husnbad says we are not organized enough to have a houskeeper come back in since the premove in cleaning. He has someone mow the lawn, I would like the house to be clean even if it is around some boxes. It isnt like we have kids rooms with knee high stuff on the floor, I remember those days and somehow their own homes don't have those rooms! I was so happy to feel well enough to be able to cooperate with getting some things outof boxes and onto shelves. My DD is a therapist and I think she would make a wonderful professional organizertoo, she has just the right touch. Calamity, how are you doing with the taxol #2? I hope you newlasta isnt too hard on you. I tried to get out of it b ut I woeuld have had to go to every three weeks instead of Dose Dense and since I beleive their si some evidence that dose dense is more effective I decided to give it a try. I think the weeks off with the cold gave me a little more endurance to try again.  I love you all and read every word you all write.  Gingerbrew",

I don't buy it that a surgeoin will not take out anothers placemet of a port. My port was put in by a visiting surgoen. I have to have a different surgeon remove it!   You have had way more than your share of aggravation with your port. Lady in Bama, you have eyebrows? I was trying to put a little really pale eyebrow pencil on just to give a little definition to my face and my eyebrows are so gone, gone, gone that I couldn't do it properly.  I have noticed that all of my skin is just bad, aged looking. I recall they told me on my fist group visit that one of the things that chemowould do is age me. I agree, that is beter than the option but I guess I hadn;t really thought of what that would mean. Wherria and Momof2, I had my lumpectomy in Winfield at CDH just before we moved in June. I lived in DuPage for  40 years. It is a great place to live, good restaurants, forest preserves, schools and medical facilities. My breast surgeon was wonderful, competent, thoughtful, and inspired confidence.  I continue to feel a little better each day, measure with a micrometer though. I still get dizzy, breathless, very difficult to go up even one step. Those who can run, super, I hope to be able walk around again. I think we are in different life stages but I want to function again. Go to the grocery store, or the dog park and stroll around. My G'ma's lived to 88 and 93, I am 65 and feel so out of shape. This chemo knocked me down so much. I have been amazed at how bad I have felt after the end of chemo.    If you are having a bunch of symptoms you might want to look at all of the symptoms of Neuropathy. It is not just numbness, it includes most of the symptoms we have been talking about.  I was very surprised to read this myself. Hugs to all my BC.org friends GInger",

Gyn had me have vaginal ultrasound said I had hyperplasia and within just a couple days I had a total hysterectomy. This is a cautionary tale, I did not need the surgery, the Gyn erred. He told me about it and I did not sue him, it wouldn't have changed anything. Please get a second opinion, if you ever are told you have hyperplasia. The Gyn had a previous patient on unopposed estrogen who did get uterine cancer and died very quickly, he was reacting to that with me.  I am taking glutamine now. It mixes with Gatorade really well. I hope it heals the neuropathy. I think I would walk more easily then.  Calamity so sorry to hear of you SE's. That  must be scary, it sounds more serious than the fog from chemo. Are there any studies showing it would go away. My Rad's doc said aching knees would go away after about 7 months when on the antihormonals. Of course 7 months in the fog you describe would be impossible. There are other meds maybe your Doc will know one that will work for you. Your naturopath sounds like you will have other options too. I am just sorry to hear of one more thing for any of us.  I feel okay, just a bit dragged out. Maybe the ZPak will fix me up.  Hugs Ginger  Diagnosis: 5/27/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIb, Grade 3, 1/20 nodes, ER+/PR+,",

It is almost totally straight now and is hard for me to style after a lifetime of curly hair. It is cut in layers and is about chin length. I can curve it around a bit with a comb when it is wet. I looks nice, I look \"put together\" for the first time in years.   Did I tell you I did that major return to Cold water Creek, I got mea bucks back and bought myself a few things that go together, like sweater and shirt that go well. I even got some new jeans ans pants. I got so much money back I gave my DD one of the gift cards and she is just thrilled with the clothes she got.  Most importantly at my DD insistance I went and got fitted for bras. I was wearing a cub size and a band size too big. Now my boobs are properly elevated so my new clothing looks very nice. I am still 50 pounds too much over diganosis weight, which was already too much. However I look nice, I feel like I can go out and run into the store and not be stared at like \"I am off my meds.\"  I walked around the Bellevue Mall yesterday and felt normal.   My friends mom beat BC and died from Leukemia, I had forgotten that. I was on Cytoxin too, I hope it doesn't come back to get me or any of us.  Texas, I want to punch the insurance company for you!!!!!!!  Lizzy hi there!  I have a big bunch of people in my house for the last three days for a board meeting of the water mission in Haiti that I volunteer for. I resigned the board after 10 years, but my DH is still on, so there is lots going on in the house. I am alone up in the sewing room. Very quiet.  I am tryng not to log on too often as I can get drawn into dark feeling if I am here too much. Never wwith any of you, my friends, but in general topics. I want to stay brighter but still visit with you too.  My wondow boxes look spectacular with violas, pansys, snap dragons, etc really pretty.  Laters Ginger",

Your poor husband coming up on the scene must have been traumatic.  Texas, I heard your remarks about your neighbor a little differently. You are worried about the kids up there aren't you? You are a natural helper and it is so difficult to stand back from a situation and not lend a hand.  If you pass the woman in the laundry or hallway perhaps you can just commiserate with her how hard it is with two little ones. If you suspect she is in a major depression maybe you could tell her about a place you know of where they can give her a hand up from her situation.   Maybe an invitation to go to church would help, maybe not. Please be cautious in your level of involvement, you only have so much energy yourself.  Boundaries are difficult when you are a natural helper, but critically important to your own family.      I think your heart is  in the best of places.  Lizzy's point of view is also valid and may help you.  I am distressed by the news coming off of Staten Island. I can't help but believe that these people have been left for last becauyse they are a working class area.  How can anyone say they aren't?   I am ashamed of our disaster response in this country and how weak we are in that realm.   The Red Cross  and FEMA know what our actual capabilities are and still people are told to have THREE days worth of supplies. We are NOT prepared and peole suffer.   Rant over for now.    Please recall I have worked in Social Services all my life, with homeless people and families.    Love GInger",

Bears are much less likely to become problems if we do not provide any food source.  In our area a bear walking by would not be a reason to trap it. A bear being agressive would be and is very unlikely if we go our own way.   Locally a bear and two cubs got over into an apartment complex and they had to be removed.

This is a new height and unlike anything I have ever done in my life.  SOme of you know I have weird sleeping issues well here is a new one that shocked even me. After our blackout yesterday I had to restart my computer and load the pages I like open back in. As I went to history I saw three pages that jarred my memory. One sells spray on makeup, another sells face cream, and the last sells pearls.  With a weird realization I realized that Monday I bought a product online form each site. I almost never wear makeup but I remember the ad like a dream. I have a few face cream products but because I have oily skin, combination really, I don't use cream except maybe moisturizer, I remember that ad like a dream, finally I bought an 18\" 9mm strand of cultured pearls even though I have pleanty of pearls as they are my birthstone and my favorite to wear since I wear virtually no jewelry, never have. I spent about $300 on these items and the skin cream is even a subscription type deal.  I sat my husband down, told him what I just told you and gave him my debit/charge card to our main household account. I am all anout fessing up right away if something strange happens because it keeps my life simpler but Good God this has me feeling like a real crazy person. Sleep spending, coma spending. I know I was very drowsy and drifted off sitting on the couch and waking up was weird. I have never ever done this before (I thin) and hope I will never do it again.     I went into our tv and removed the channel this all happened on. It was never on our usual menu for the tv I watch but my husband had switched them around for some reason. I am not blaming him but that is how the channel was even there for me to view. I do not like TV shopping channels on tv and try to never watch them.  This feels bad my friends.  I need to go back to the danged sleep doctor and do the all wired up test.  I hope this sleep Doc has some help for me. This is getting crazier.  We each have our own quirks I feel really weireded out discovering this at 67 years old!   The gun ranges are getting way out of hand.   Ginger ",

So my knees don't hurt but my hair is falling out. I was in a car crash Sept 3 and am still so sore I can barely even turn over to get out of my bed. My back starts to hurt so very much when I even just stand up to go up the hall. A car hit me in the drivers side rear quarter panel at 45 MPH. I can still hear the sound, it spun us around and backwards down into a ditch. Zoe my DGD who is now 3 was in the back in her car seat. She was physically alright but screamed and screamed. This happened right at the intersection where her Montessori School is so we quickly had several teachers over in the ditch with us and they comforted Zoe and after the paramedics examined Zoe they took her back to school until my DD could get there from work. This was my first crash and I hope to never have it happen again. I went to the hospital in the fire dept ambulance and really appreciated the paramedics. One of the tests they did on me at the ER was a cat scan of my neck and it showed a node on my thyroid. The DR said the accident could be a blessing because they found this. I need to go to teh Dr about this. I have really just stayed home I am very reluctant to be a passenger in a car, I sort of want to jump out. My car was totaled so I have to get out to get a new car. My car was so perfect, no problems ever and they are totaling it out. It was a red toyota highlander, it helped to keep us safe. I am pledging to all of you that I will actually make Doc appts today. I need a mammogram, eye glasses, internist, somebody to check on this thyroid node, car dealer, dentist (a front crown came out, tooth next to very front I look a sight! To flesh out this story I should mention that on Sept 1 my dog pulled my sideways off the front steps of the house, no handrails because they are very wide stairs. Of course this happened at one in the morning and my DH was out of town. I went careening off the stairs over this landscaped area and across probably 20 feet of the driveway before landing on my hands , knees, and head. I had big skinned knees and a black eye along with the heels of my hands being skinned. The worst part was that I could not freaking get up! I had to crawl back around to the stairs to get myself up. As I was laying on the drive the dogs decided there was something in trees and went into \"alert alert\" mode which did give me some adrenalin to get myself going. I have talked your ears off here. I am glad to be back, Hugs",

Your Christianity has been evident to me and I can see that you are supported by your beliefs. I will keep you in my prayers.

I have opthomoplegic migraine and would also have not been surprised to have the pain right in my eye as you did. I am happy that someone decided to do the best scan on you.  Are the Rads going to target the brain mets and the eye mets at the same time?  The Rads I had were quiet and the room was cool and peaceful. The Rads did not hurt one bit. My table went a distance up in the air, so be sure not to hop off!  Yes, Lizzy I am okay. I go for my SCCA check up, mammo, blood tests, Onc appt.  this thursday. I am still going to physical therapy twice a week for the car accident. I hurt a lot in the T7 vertebrae when I stand or try to walk. The physical therapists are trying to make everything around it supportive. I wish just that would work. I still can only walk about 20 steps before the pain starts to knock me down. My dear little grandaughter asks me almost every day, \"Does your back still hurt Gamma?\" I would like to tell her it is just fine but she knows different. The darned auto insurance guy called me early on NYE and I didn't know what he was getting at. My physical therapist told me he is trying to close my file. I never expected MY insurance to do that. Naive I am.  My physical Therapist told me we lose 1% of our lean muscle mass for every day we are on 100% bed rest. The PT's really are helping me get more mobile, I was hurt so bad I had to yell when I was trying to get out of bed. It is better now than it was. I really value that therapy.  I will be trying to keep the chocolate resolution.  I think of all of you often. I hope we do have a get together where we can all get together.

After all the usual, mammo (all okay), blood work, Onc appt, the Onc ordered a MRI scan of my cervial and thorasic spine and it was difficult. The loudest machine I have ever been in. I had ear covers and more and it still sounded like the worst, head mounted,metal bucket percussion band ever for about an hour. I made the mistake of moving my arms and made it blurry at one point so they had to do part of it over again. I had contrast in an IV and it didn't hurt at all. The test itself didn't hurt, just made me feel insane.  I tried to think of you in my pocket and the Tim Gunn show that  would be on yesterday evening. I don't have the results yet. They said a DR at the University of WA was going to read it and they would compare it do Dexa scans I have had there in the past two years. Onc decided to do this because she did not like my Cervical and Thorasic spine symptoms. She said she will just pass it on to the regular DR for followup. The scheduler found that there was an oping for MRI in 7 minutes and through some crazy alignment of the stars I was in there with in 20 minutes. Please pray for all clear for me. I didnt hear today. There is also a rehab physician at SCCA who I can see and who can treat the vertebra if it needs specific treatment. That would be so wonderful. I really think something needs treatment, and if it could make it stop hurting so I can walk again I would be so grateful!!!!!  I'll be back at you when I hear anything.  Hugs Ginger",

As I understood her tentative reading of my test results I have a \"fractured C1 it is a narrowing and my spinal cord is not transected.\" \" There is also something at the T1\" At this point I asked her to email me the test results. I asked if she could do this right away and she said she would try to this morning. Wow I am glad I don't have a transected C1, that would make me dead wouldn't it? She is new and sounds even newer than new. I miss My Onc's previous nurse who was a wealth of knowledge. I had to wait a week for these results totally unlike my facility .

Apparently a sister had taken second mortgages on the property that the, now deceased, mother didn't know about. So the functioning sister finds out that the property is in deep debt. Sooooo we now live in another suburb of Seattle and are trying to cram into a house that is 700 sq feet smaller and has a two car garage vs the five car garages we had. We tried to donate, trash and otherwise get rid of things but we still have rooms filled with boxes plus the garage. We were on 5 acres and now have a backyard that is 14 feet deep with 6 ft side yards. Ai yi yi. Eventually we may get mostly unpacked. Maybe. My back is just so bad now that I cant pick up one thing. My poor husband has had to do so much work. We even paid the movers to pack the kitchen and dining room and our housekeeper stayed longer on her day to pack. Now the old landlord is trying to keep our money even though the inspection was perfect. I have a sinking feeling she doesn't have it. Laws here are strict and we were supposed to get our deposit back in 14 days. Nopy nope, no money. I go see the Onc just for a checkup in July. No mammo. My first cousin who had been clear for 12 years and had a recurrance and then went to stage four, now has another recurrance. SHe is in chemo this time. I feel awful for her. She is a couple years older than me and I will be 70 in June. On the good side, this house is really well set up except for it being two story. It has little extras like silent light switches, no big water heater just small ones, good wiring and really nice back yard deck, small but quite perfect. I like this house and it is closer to our DD and Sil and DGD. That I love! I think of everyone just not as often as I used to. Love to you all! Ginger",

I got blurry vision and some verticle double vision so my Onc ordered me off of Tamoxifen and to do the MrI. Now I am to go to the eye DR and see if I have any catraracts forming. Then back to Onc to discuss more antiuhormonals. Ugh just these three weeks off of Tamox has made me feel rather normal. Just aasense of well being. I also got to see my ventricles. I have normal pressure hydrocephalus and saw how where most peoples ventricles stay the dame as they go up mine get larger. I have no symptoms but should probably see some Neuro just to get it on record outside the ER where it was discovered when I fell on my head back in 2012.

How about US Government programs for people going into nursing? Avon is also good at funding scholarships. Also ask the financial aid office at the school you are most likely to attend if there are any scholorships, in their experience, that mature students most often seem to receive. You will hate me for this, but I have to tell you that grad school was only $5,000.00 a year in 80 to 82. My DD may never be out of grad school debt. It took us 7 years to pay off her Soph through Senior years at a very competitive school. Her grad school has been since she married and her loans are on hold for a little while more. It is just so difficult to fund education today I really feel for you. When I was an undergrad my state scholarship and fed grant would pay my tuition almost entirely, now it would be a ten percent down payment, if that!  Okay, I will my rant on the excessive cost of education and try to think of what other doom and gloom I can bring to you. So Sorry about that. My flowering bushes are blooming and I have never had ones like these before. Yhey are huge and the flowers look incredible. Not Azaleas but the others that are like them but bigger. Brain freeze here. I am from the midwest so nothing grows as big there as in Washington, except maybe the corn. I have no medical appointment this week and I am loving it.  Omaz techies are my favorite people in the entire world. Without techies we would all be writing long letters and waiting weeks for a response. GInger",

If I read nothing else I read this thread everyday. Thank you Caerus-Sunflowers and all of you thank you for reminding me that this is a life saving drug. I felt overwhelmed by this feeling of crabbiness, crankiness and yes, discomfort in my own skin. I am taking 150 Effexor and have been for a few years since my mothers death, I was down to 75 mg and had planned to go off of it when BC struck last year. My Onc moved me back up last fall when I found myself crying and crying, Now because I had a D3 of only 8, yes, no typo, 8, I had some massive doses of D3 and now 4000 mg a day. I also take B6 200 mg, an ultra mega vitamin for women over 50, calcium, fish oil ( a good kind), Glucosamine and Chondroitin, allegra for seasonal allergies and an antacid for gerd. I went back on this full regimen of vitamins the same day I started the generic Arimidex.I had neglected all except the D3 for a couple months. Today I feel pretty good, better than in the last week. Maybe the vitamins are taking hold. I also went to see a counselor and had an initial meeting with an internist. I haven't had a \"regular\" doctor in a long long time, just a bunch of oncological specialists for the last year. I moved here a year ago and live out where you don't see your neighbors because of all the trees. I made the effort, took the risk, to stop my car and introduce myself to my first neighbor, first non cancer person. I was surprised at how happy that made me feel. I went to a community meeting in Seattle about homelessness, that was the area my work was always in, and remembered that I have passion for that. I even felt competent to speak to some solutions. The spell of crankiness knocked me flat because that is not my personality, it overwhelmed me in its intensity. Being able to come here to BCO made the difference because you all have collective wisdom to share, and do. Thank you so much, I want to live, I want to not worry every day that I am on some sort of rickety bridge that will collapse when I least expect it. I suppose I am more afraid than I have ever expressed. I don't want to leave this world, I love being alive and have wasted the last several years in deep depression since my mothers death and now need to find the way to step away from it back into living fully. So, thank you for your responses. I pray I can tolerate this medicine. If it gives me a 5% more chance of long term servival, I'll take it.",

Going out with my daughter is something I will always do because the motivation is so strong.

Until I became depressed I never had issues with going out of the house but after that began I found myself hiding away, not answering the phone or the door. I want more than anything for life to feel normal again, just regular, doing regular stuff. I don't need fancy jewels or dinners or trips. I do need my friends, of whom I miraculously still have some, all 2000 miles away. I need my family. I need my pets. I enjoy a few hobbies, sewing, arts, etc. and haven't been doing any of them.

I was this awful truent in high school, went back to school  .l and just loved every minute. Except for the third week of every semester when I would be sure I was going to have to drop half my classes. Just a little third week panic. When do you think you might get back up this way? Any idea? Calamity. I have three boys and one girl, all grown. I understand.  Oh boy what a real scare at your house. I am happy to hear your son's eyes are not damaged.  Lizzy sounds like you are making progress toward reconstruction. Good news. Yeah make that ball game and have some beer and brats. Yes our grand daughter is a year old now. Sheis also saying lots of individual words and has learned to ask, \"What's that?\" Sheis keeping us busy and is so much fun.   My puppy figured out how to get the litter box filter out and made a big mess. We now have three doggie gates and will soon add one on the stairway to keep Stewie out of the upstairs. I will post a photo of him soon. He is so fluffy and is poodle red. I think he should be a lion for Halloween   LOve and hugs all  Ginger",

I think my hot flashes are slowing down a bit now and hope that continues.  Your new numbness in your hands may be due to the antihormonal you are taking. Also YES  YES  YES Neuropathy absolutely does come from chemo. Good luck with your surgery. I hope it is simply boring!   My nephew just started college at American University in WA DC. In the first week he had an earthquake and hurricane and then his mom, my SIL, had her gallbladder removed yesterday. I am hoping this is all the interesting events he will suffer for awhile. He is such a bright and good kid.  He actually wants to go into politic to make a difference. You know, that makes me worried for him. I hope all of you who are dealing with the leavings of hurricane Irene are spared any events relating to the new one moving east. Regarding water you can go ahead and store some now. A drop of bleach per gallon allows you long term storage. If you store water in your tub try putting plastic wrap around the plug to make the seal better. Test it now, and be sure.

LOL   I have a system, I just cut my hair the same length all over my head and because it is curly/wavy it comes out looking cute. I can see that it is thinner now so I may use some minolodil again. I did that for quite a while after I had the hysterectomy in the 90's.  I did my step back from full service on the board of directors yesterday and now have blanket permission to do as much or as little as I choose.

I do agree Lizzy there is some abuse, adults taking the kids ritalyn for instance.  HAIR, I cut my hair myself just like I have done for about 30 years. Well............ all those crazy curls on the ends went away and the hair left does not have my usual managable curl and waves. I could cut my own hair with a reliable result because it was curly.

I finally got out into public, I went to a sewing class. A few minutes after I got there I started to cry but I had my glasses on so I don't think anyone noticed. It was overwhelming to be with about 16 otehr women. Everyone was really nice and fun and I made it through alright. I was SO tired when I got home but I couldnt go to sleep.  I forgot to mention, actually I am a llittle embarassed to say that my husband bought me a new humdinger of a sewing machine, thus the class. My Onc has referred me to a trial where they are trying to find out what will and won't help with cognitive issues in post chemo patients. I am going to go because I really need for this to improve. I think my DD thinks I have lost it and I know I haven't fully I just forget some things.  Today she told me I used to bring home her local newspaper all the time. She is referring to when we were moving here and were looking for a house and I had just discovered I had breast cancer.I don't remember that at all. I am starting to feel like I should lie so I don't get the \"look\" from her. Don't take me wrong , she is wonderful, thoughtful and all that but she is a therapist and therefore knows more about the issues I could have and I think is worried.  I am excited for you our mighty leader! Almost time to get the new boobies and we will all say a prayer for no infectious elements anywhere in yoour environment. You will be a glowing mass of healing!   Wherria, I hope it all gets sorted out for you soon. It was good to read that the Doc saw you same day. How is your doggie?  I got my poodle puppy in July, he is enormous now at 5 1/2 months and growing like crazy. He is really smart and I am undecided just how good a thing that is. We now have 4 puppy gates set up. Our little dog tries to convince him he is dominant and it is so strange to see Harry \"practicing\" his dominance on Stewie. He can barely reach his back. Stewie just walks away with Harry frantically hanging on and quick steppping sideways! A couple days ago I was sleeping on my side when I felt something nudging me on my shoulder. There was Stewie sitting upright on my bed and taking his paw to nudge me a little bit. He was very polite about it and has good sleeping in bed manners. Yes we sleep with our dogs. Stewie is getting bigger by the day!   Calamity, Good to hear you are able to be so responsive to Aiden. The bully makes me think of mean ways to get back but of course that isn't the way to go....but I would want to!  Texas, I missed a lot of your posts but other's responses sort of filled in the blanks a bit. I hope the Texas Sun is shining on you in the very best way.  Lady Bama, I follow you always. I am so glad your friend is improving. My FIL had to go to rehab after several months in the hospital and ICU. He has myasthenia gravis and couldn't even walk and had to relearn basic things. He did relearn everything he had lost, so that may be good news for your friend. If I missed you I apologize I will catch up later.   I am finally starting neurontin tonight my feet are still very numb, my hands are the same, somewhat numb still.  I hope it helps.    I am getting few hot flashes but am getting a little cranky. Onc says it is the Arimidex. I feel awful when I am cranky, I never feel good if I snal at someone it makes me feel awful.  This too will pass I hope! Love and hugs Ginger",

I will admit that Glinda's gown is scary in and of itself.   Lizzy, I didn't cry because I was overwhelmed by the technology, it was being out among 16 or so women that I didn't know.  My husband has been in the software business since 1979 and I have learned lots from him and some classes in grad school, albeit sometimes painfully. I also took a semester of photoshop where I did realize one would need lots of practice and instruction to gain any mastery of the tool.  I do confess though that when super marketsd began using check cashing machines and cards in the 70's I avoided those stores for a couple years because I had no clue. :)  There is a software package that I want to get that I am a bit leery of because it costs a good bit and it would involve manipulating embroidery designs rather than just using canned designs. I wouldn't want to waste our money. I do think that technology comes much more easily to my childrens generation. When my husband first programmed it was on punch tape. He still has his first high school program he ever wrote. One of his former bosses was talking about back when they had to hardwire in programs. Yikes!  I already said a prayer for you for today for peace of mind, when you will have surgery on thursday I will switch my prayer around a bit. :)  I wound up have a total hysterectomy because taking unopposed estrogen caused a thickening of my uterus. Doc DID NOT take a biopsy like yours did, he found the thickening through a vaginal ultrasound. Rushed me to surgery within just a couple days. Turned out I was still producing estrogen myself and did not have cancer. (The Doc however had a previous patient who did have cancer that spead extremely rapidly and he said he was afraid I would have the same thing.) So I turned out to have such drastic surgery years before I would have had menopause and therefore took a high level of Premarin for about 15 years altogether until just a year or so before I got breast cancer. I still think I gave myself breast cancer with the Premarin. I think you had good Docs to give you proper biopsies.  This has gotten long. ",

We meet once a month, that was my first meeting. I also will attend a monthly club that is more general just to learn new techniques. Actually I probably already know the techniques but it is a great reason for me to get out and be among women I have something in common with.  Also the dealer where I purchased the machine will give me lessons on the specifics of this machine. It is extremely advanced and has some mechanical as well as electronic features I am not familiar with.  One reason for me wanting to get out amongst people is I have decided after much thought to resign my board position at a charity that I have held for about 10 years now. There have been some internal situations that have been very difficult this year and while I want to be loyal it just tears me up to see so much disfunction from outside affecting such an important work of humanitarian  endeavor. I am going to ask to see if I can take a years leave and re-evaluate then. This work has been an important part of my identity this past decade, and it is hard to even think about leaving. Returning to sewing and the related activities is part of my effort to step back from such intense involvement. Our work is in Haiti if that gives you any idea of why this is so difficult to leave, people live and die because of what we do or don't accomplish. The enormity of the need has knocked me down a couple of times before. One example is how much I could do in Haiti with what my sewing machine costs. Liberal guilt resides in me. TMI sorry.  I do love to sew and all the things involved with it. I love that my Grandma sewed and I have her treadle machine in my sewing room. Did you know that quilting was the therapy that kept many a woman on the prairiies sane.  PS Curtains are perhaps the simplest thing to sew and a huge money saver. Lined curtains are even easier to make!  My sleep has improved somewhat this week but the bad dreams leave me really exhausted.  Wow what a disjointed post this is.  Ginger",

I sat through a two hour software class tonight and understood what was being taught. I could not have done that a week ago. I will develop some philosophy about this and be able to go forward then.  Love and hugs all Ginger",

Medical bills are the cause of many bankruptcies and the most easily forgiven by future creditors. You would be okay. In the mean time try not to talk to these people.

I was moaning and all that, it wasn't pretty.  If these had been planned tests I would have been nervous but on this occasion I was simply grateful for pain medication. The verdict was gastritis or something like that. I was really out of it when I read the paper work. I had no idea gastritis could hurt so much! We were back home by 6 and I slept until 5 PM. I have to eat bland food and was on a white diet today. I still have some pain and just took another Vicodin.  One good thing about this was that the Dr told me my liver, pancreas, galbladder and appendix all looked good on both my CAT scans and my US.  That was good to hear.  So I will go to bed soon and hopefully get up before dark!

Pasta is such a comfort food.I was also told to go to the carbs to help firm up my runny tummy.I was also told to eat meat and potatoes. We don't eat much meat so that is difficult. I did have some great braised beef at my DD on Sunday and that was so good.  I hope you all have a good week and build your own version of a girl room in your living space.  Ginger",

I have worried about recurrence and tried to understand it and figure out the hows and whys and  really got nowhere with it.   Please do not anyone worry about \"bringing us down\". If not here, where?  This is our place and if you post your concern it very likely has something to do with my concern. Who else can I ask and get good feedback. Today my DIL told me she thought her Aunt had BC because her husband smoked in the house and she ate poorly and that it \"could be that\" because we don't actually know. Now, does anyone think I am going to have that discussion again. Um, no no no.  Here we support one another, cry together, laugh together.  Every single opinion matters to me and means something in this crazy constellation of ideas, diagnosis, and unknowns we are caught up in.  I have the sniffles, some sneezes last night and two or three coughs today. I haven't been out of the house in 7 days only DD in on thursday and DH home from the road on thursday night. Where on earth did I get this.  DH got flu shot at the airport but I do not think that could get me, killed virus right? This place is really important to me and I think to the rest of you too.  Sweet dreams",

Hah. My husband and my DD aren't ill, where did I get this? Whine, whine, moan.  All of your responses about the swollen lymph node made me feel much better, I had scared myself. Thank you, it is so good to have some feedback. If I ask my husband all I will do is scare him.  Texas, some of my best memories were of plannng out Halloween costumes and making them. One year our DD was the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, second edition, unabridged. I sent her photo to the editor of the dictionary and before long a very heavy box came addressed to our DD iand it was the dictionary as a gift to her. Being a kid, she said maybe she should have been a box of Fannie Mae Candy! You can make Christmas ornaments together that the kids, under any circumstances, will enjoy as adults. Have a great time with them, making memories for all of you. :) .  I agree the Droids do make me feel better during the day however I feel very emotional as I am coming off of them.  Zenith, I think a rescue dog saved my life about 4 years ago. I was plunging into a deep depression and this little puppy mill rescue dog who was afraid of everyone, who hated men, who wouldn't let anyone touch him with a comb, who would not allow himself to be petted, decided I was his person.  Together we made our way through the depths, he becoming a dog, me eventually coming up for air from the depths of where my spirit had plunged. I think the healing power of the relationship with dogs is powerful. ",

      "Content": "Sep 30, 2010 05:03AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 05:50AM by Gingerbrew Thank you Lisa, I humbly accept your apology.  After working in the social services, with high risk clients, my entire career I was stunned to find myself the victim of a major depression that robbed me of 4 years of my life. My mother died, some neighbor kids killed my beautiful dog. Thus the downward spiral began,I was unable to dress, bathe or brush my teeth. I did not answer the door or the telephone. I neglected my duties as president of a charities board of directors and that caused loss of income to an important cause. I slept in the day and was awake in the quiet and solitude of night. I saw a counselor for the first three years and a psychiatrist for medication the last three years. I cried alot of the first year until I was on proper medicaiton, really needed because the depths seemingly have no bottom at that point. If I had, had more enrgy then I mmigt bery well have killed myself.  I could see no colors, enjoy no food, look forward to nothing.I isolated myself from friends and neighbors. My husband bought me a new house, I never unpacked my sewing room and we were there for two years. I could watch tv endlessly not caring.My husband traveled 100% of the time the last year before we moved and I would spend weeks never leaving the house except for the doctor.  Light finally began to peek in about a year and a half ago, meds were decreased and I felt like I was a member of the human race once again. Not fully functioning, but able to communicate, to care, to be glad I was alive and able to plan. I now take a low maintenance dose of a antideperessant because once you are over 65 your chance of recrrance of depression is something over 90%. So the thought is this is a good idea. I have no side effects and I no longer feel like I am in a haze or fog. My ability to reason, such as it is, returned.  and then I got breast cancer. I am grateful I did not get it four years ago and yes I am sad I got it now.  Thank you again for your apology. I am never so direct as I was in my post. I think it is a sign of my returned health  that I dared to be. Thank you for unwittingly giving me the opportuniy to be so direct and then having the grace to apologize. Ginger Your sister",

They had a special protocol in place asking if I had any cold symptoms, they had a list. I was given a mask and instantly taken off to an isolation room where I was not allowed to remove my mask. I had my blood draw by a masked nurse. I was sent with my mask directly up to where I see my doc and was given a sheet to fill out and they wisked me off to another room where my masked and gloved doc came in. She decided I needed to wait another week to have chemo.    They were amazingly strict about my symptoms and I am glad for that. As I waited,maked up to get my port access removed back at the blood draw lab I realized I was in line with a child who had hair that looked just like mine. We need to all protect her from my cold. So I am glad they were so strict. I didn't think I was still that sick, I got this about 11 or more days ago.  I am scheduied for next monday the 11th, So now all I need to do is go off ot the Steroids I took last night to prepare for the Taxol. I had 8 mg at 3 am and then 8 mg at 9 am and then came to a screetching halt with the cancellation of the chemo that was to be at 3 PM.  The doc said I do not need antibiotics because I have had no fever or mucus that was anything but clear. She did say that I need to call if there is any change of any kind that there is a low threshold for me needing antibiotics. Whatever that means. I will be sire to write on the 11th how it goes. My DD with the new baby will need to bring me beause my husband can't manage aother day off.  I did get some cough syrup with codeine so maybe I will sleep through a night. Maybe my husband will too.  PS to whoever was falling. They ask me at every exam if I have fallen in the last two weeks, first question everytime. I have not but I wonder what it has to do with chemo. ",

Still couging. No temp.  My cough is one of the hoo hoo coughs. The doc said it wasnt in my lungs on Monday and it still feels bhronchial to me. It is just hanging on SOO long, two weeks today since first symptom.  If this keeps up I will be delayed another week.

I did go to one baseball game in elementary school, I don't know which team. Never understood the game, had no brothers or sisters and don't know if my mother actually liked the game. Hah! .  I do like watching the Olympics and the X Games.  Team sports simply escape me, although I do work well with and enjoy groups of women.Maybe I would enjoy a baseball game if I were with a group of women?

The lumpectomy looks okay but my boob is off kilter.  The scars are okay too, not a problem. Eliminating the worry of another lump appearing bothers me. Ginger",

I think that would point to the combos that are tasty.  I know when I worked in Haiti the cook would make this one green vegetable that I simply could not eat and it was all a matter of texture and lack of flavor. I love vegetables too!  The directors wife had forbid the cook from using any flavorings because she beleived us NOrthAmericans couldn't handle them. She was Danish, the directors wife and had been in country for twenty years. Rice and beans can be really good if you have sauce pwa with it, bean sauce.

Texas, my brave young friend has been a part of my life since July 2001. We met in a Kareoke Bar in LA.  He is the person who Baptised me in Aligator Pond in December that year. I was not a believer then, I worked for Elimidate, haha. When God decides to tap your shoulder He doesn't mess around. He is now the Director of our mission in Haiti, Clean Water For Haiti. If you go the web site you might want to link over to the Rollings in Haiti blog and read Earthquake Day that Chris wrote.  I know if I had BC in Haiti I would not live. Sometimes I feel bad about complaining about my pain but I am human and fragile, as we all are. I go for my next treatment on Monday, it will be #7 and  wonder if they will change anything?  My  toenails look about the same. The aches and shooting pain has been similar. I am definitely have increased numbness in my feet and hands. Did I tell you all IU was walking in the house the other morning and my husband noticed a cord sticking out of my slipper. It was attrached to my book light which was in my slipper. I couldnt even feel it!!!!!!! How crazy is that!!!!!!   Everyone I am so grateful you have been here on the days after my treatments when the pain starts. It is a bizarre experience to be using so many drugs and feeling unsire of what I am doing. I think the book light in the slipper gave my husband notice that he needed to pay closer attention. I would agree, a booklight in my freakin slipper!! ",

I have had a cough lately, well duh, we have thick pollen on everything. I am in the middle of the woods here. Still I get nervous, my dad died of lung cancer and his presenting symptom was a cough. Of course he coughed for years and years. So the other morning I was having one of my dreams. There was this b ig wheel turning with pegs in it. I needed for what ever half a**ed reason to jump onto the wheel and instert myself into my peg hole. So, in my sleep, I leap from the bed across the floor into the closet door landing on my side. My feet remain tangled in covers. My brain simply fails in its task of keeping my motor functions paralyized during sleep like it is supposed to do!  I am still achy, my dogs think I am insane and my husband who wasn't here is just glad he wasn't in the way.   I am a weird dreamer and am starting to think I need to pad all corners on furniture.  For me to even think I wasleaping is crazy, I am not capable of leaping but somehow did throw myself off the bed again. I was perpendicular to the bed when I landed so some sort of energy was in the leap. Argh.     Texas thinking about you lots.   Sweeny good to hear from you.

I can see that could get cumbersome but constantly having to clean up after them is a nightmare. Our two cats are 14 and 15 years old now. I suspect one of them is just peeing whereever he feels like it when he feels like it. Sometimes all is good for a while and then one day my DD will walk in the front door and say, \"someone is peeing on the landing.\" Dogs can't get up there so it is a cat and Rudy is the one who hangs out upstairs. My DH is very attached to the cats and I have no idea when to let a cat \"go.\" Our previous cats died from cancer so it wasn't a question once the vet said it was time. It is just hard to think about but shall I let them destroy a rental house where we have a huge deposit? We use the various enzyme cleaners and pros too. Don't worry, I wouldn't put either of them down for mistakes and we always try to fix what we are missing ourselves. I am just coming to realize these kitties are getting old. I wonder if my feeling sick last week is related? I got UTI symptoms on tuesday and after getting my hair cut (tada!!!) I went to the Doctors. I had bacteria in my sample and the Dr started me on Cipro. He called this AM, thursday, to tell me the culture grew E coli so Cipro would be fine. After I went to the DR I got much sicker very quickly before I got the Antib's, chills and shking the entire deal.  I am so glad I went to the DR.   My friends who live in Haiti full time, and run the water filter program, managed to get Typhoid a few weeks ago. I think that is E coli based too. Cipro is used to treat it as well. It isn't unexpected to get typhoid in Haiti. I think they need to get their vaccines updated while they are back in June. Our base is in the area that has had huge Cholera outbreaks and they have managed not to get that so far.   Stay well everybody.  Hugs Ginger",

I am going to ask my Onc if I can take the Aromasin on the on a certain amount of time and then a break. It worked so well when I got off of the Arimidex that I am hoping it might be an idea for the Aromasin. I was pretty much SE free the first months on the Aromasin.  Yesterday I got a huge muscle spasm from the Mammo, ouch. The reason they did the additional views was there were new crystals or calsifications so the tech pulled my chest flesh further into the squisher as well as my underarm flash. I think my chest wall muscles must have responded to that and been really sore.  My dog Stewie is getting more mellow by the day. He is on an extended leave from running so I am surprised he isn't more antsy. His parts are no longer swollen so he may get back to full acvtivity soon. The cats and Harry the little dog are all much releived by Stewies newfound coll and calmness.  Texas, come to Washington it is nice and cool here. It is about 70 and sunny a real treat for up here. I think I will never complain about the coolness here after this difficult summer for most of the country. I am not looking in here so often any longer but [probably will for a while now after being so darn scared. I remain amazed at how strongly I reacted and with so much fear. I do think I will be chill again soon once I work through this. Thanks for the hugs and stuff.  Love Ginger ",

DH is out of town.The dogs were barking like crazy and by the time I got to the other side of the bed and sliding door and flipped the outdoor light switch the bear had turned and was jumping down the three stairs and running on all fours to the back of the yard.  For just a moment I thought it was a burglar dressed like a Ninja but the running on all fours convinced me it was a bear.   The deck has two levels, it goes all across the back of the house and the higher level is by the end of thehouse where our bedroom is. My DGD bubble wand tub was up there and is now on the lower level.     A couple weeks ago we had three bears walk through the North side of the yard and go off into the wooded area once again. We haven't seen them since. :)  We keep no food of any kind outside. The dogs only go out with us, on lead and with me just in the front of the house. My DH takes them over to the fenced in paddock where they can run around.  Dog story for today. DH left a dog chewie on top of big legal bookcase, the kind with the lift up glass doors.  I hear a strange nnoise in the hall and here is big Stewie standing on his hind legs, with his front legs up on the opening edge of the top door with his face up higher on the glass. I know if I hadn't caught him he would have been jumping up and down on his hind legs to get that chewie down.  He has an amazing reach and is pushing us to put things further and further  away.  That his bark scares off a bear earns him a place of honor anyways!    Laters Ginger",

We had a fine restaurant where the owners/ cooks decided to come in on Christmas day and cook as a way of giving back for their good fortune. Our clients were very reluctant to go. Only two families went. We forget that people in need are often people who have never had access to so many places and things we take for granted. With poverty life becomes smaller and smaller, with less education your world becomes very small. Going into a fine salon for free haircuts , going into a fine restaurant, a high end store all can be incredibly intimidating. Even a library or a teacher meeting can overwhelm some folks whose lives have been limited.    Just a few thoughts.  Love Ginger",

Headache is on top and front.    I had a cat scan and didnt show any bleeding so good. It did however show that I have a physiological condition called Normal Pressure Hydrocephaleus. Depending on wether or not I have certain symptoms I may need a shuttle, no shunt. The three symptoms are gait, my gait is way off but is it from periferal neuropathy or this NPH. Next is urinary incontinance. I go to the bathroom every hour or two, this is apparently too often. Third is dementia, hopefully all I had was from chemo and is pretty well gone.    I am pretty confused right now. I found a decent website so feel a little better informed.     Oh yesm when I feel it was outside my house and I couldn't get up, Holy Crap I couldnt get up.  That is my mother or great aunt not ME!     So crap.  Did I mention I do not like going to the Doctor, even wonderful Doctors.  Love you all  Ginger",

My on line/telephone 2 1/2 year friend Stillverticle, who was banned here about 1 1/2 years ago and then we continued in a private group on FaceBook so she could be with us. Well  she was killed by police on Easter Sunday.   If you put NC, Silver Alert,  Shot by troopers 3/31/13 in Google you will get the various news reports.   For those of us who are part of that group it has been an exhausting week of trying to make sense out of all the circumstances. We have also posted on the For Older People with Sense, and the Olderpeople who have energy or whatever the title is.   So here I am, my head is kind of fried. I still can't beleive that in NC they have a Sllver Alert that is for people who have dementia or cognitive impairment and if the peolice do hunt yu down you MUST stop for them, if they tell you, who has comitted no crime, to get out of the car that you MUST.   Her cousin had called in this Silver Alert and I like to think she was trying to get help for her cousin. Instead she also told the police Mel had guns. Well Melissa also had every single thing she owned in the car. telling the police, who knows what all, the police took a hard stance and really pushed Melissa.    Her cousin is a church member southern Christian, a business owner, offered Mel she could stay there for treatment but needed to follow the rules she set up. Melissa is an old hippie, sober and clean for 26 years, non traditional, Mount Everest Climber, pro nature photographer living in little cottages on the outerbanks, dog loving person. Aslo she was 60 years old and had some history with bi polar illness.  So on Easter Sunday at about 10:15 AM police saw Melissa and told her to pull over. She refused to stop and so drove ahead of them for 15 minutes. There was no high speed chase. Then she got a flat so she puilled over. Because her cousin had told them she had weapons they did not come to the car. Melissa was ordered to exit the car.   The official report says that the officers negotiated tirelessly but Melissa refused to exit. The total of the \"Negotiation \" was for 65 minutes. Anyway Melissa did get out of her car,  (by then there were police who had arrived from 5 counties, all with guns.) she had weapons in her hands, unnamed weapons, I know she had a rifle, maybe a handgun. She was about cameras and did range shooting, no hunting no shooting at people. So the plice official report says she pointed aa gun at the police and they gunned her down so powerfully that resident close to the four lane divided highway said his house shook.  Melissa was dead on the spot. She had committed no crime, was not wanted for any crime and on thei Easter morning she was dead.  She was terrified of her new recrrent cancer diagnosis and afraid of treatmebnt. Her cosin wanted her to get treamtnet within certain perameters and Melissa wasn't up for her cousins schedule so she chose to leave.  Her and her English Springer Spaniel Angus were driving toward her town on the outerbands, they had left Winston Salem they were going home to the place the Melissa loved with her wild horses, birds, ocean living. Melissa was going home.    It  is the biggest damn mess I have ever been involved in. I miss her frequent lovely photos, her jokes, her wry snese of humor, I just miss her. She was one of us.   Love you all  Ginger PS I know the police are trained to respond to a person firing on the but I didnt know they would shoot you dead for having a gun in your hand. The coroner has said there were multiple shots into Melissa, but not how many yet. The state is doing an investigation and of course two officers are on admin leave and one more named in some places. I am so sad, Mmelissa was so afraid oof treatment because chemo nearly killed her first time out with terrible reactions.    Among other big issues with all of this is that her cousin tells us the medical team in winston salem said she had a 95% chance of cure with a lumpectomy and rads?  Her fear was just all encompassing and she didn't believe she could have a simpler treatment plan.   Oh God this has really broken my heart and collectively the heart of our little group.   ",

I haven't paid much attention to that.  For sewing get a used European machine. I like Viking myself. Dealers usually offer some sort of lessons for machines bought in their stores. Major brands require the dealers to do so. I hope you have a lot of fun, there are all sorts of on-line resources now. Home decor can be really satisfying. My Dd has been teaching herself quilting.

DH is still out of town.  Sort of funny; At about 5AM our time I told the dogs, who were in bed with me, that Dad would be home tonight. They both moved into hunter pointer positions, (they are poodles) then jumped down to the door. Woofing expectantly.   I decided to call my husband so he could speak to them. He is two time zones east of us on this trip. He answers sounding like a wounded animal. I apologize and ask if he is up? He says NOOOO I have oh, er, five minutes left.  I put him on speaker phone and it made the dogs happy to think he lives in my phone.  I lived with my DH traveling all the time for over three decades and I was okay. Now I hate it, just hate it.  I hope you all have a good day and no aches or pains. Especially no flu!   Hugs Ginger",

My comb always has hair in it, if I run my fingers through my hair I will have strays in my hand. My hair is still growing but apparently not holding on as long as is usual. I have the skinniest little pony tail.  So no patches at this time and it doesnt seem to be heading that way.  I loved my original pre chemo hair, it was curly and so easy to care for, just wash, scrunch and go. I even cut it with the kitchen shears and it still looked normal. Carly hair is so easy in my opinion. Now it is straight.  I am looking for Lizzy and Texas. I hope they might be visiting with one another. Wouldnt that be nice.  Hugs to Sue and Rachel too.

I will still be seen at the womens center at SCCA and have mamo there and follow up with nurse practitioner. My friends aunt who feel while out on a walk and broke her neck and became paralyzed died a few days later. So sad and unexpected. My friend who I had not seen in 35 years came to visit for two weeks. She and her son lived with me and my boys when I was divorced in the 70's. She did so much work while she was here, unpacking and organizing and cooking too. She said she wanted to do it because I had done so much for her all those years ago. I was simply stunned, no one has ever done that for me before in that kind of way. It was humbling and amazing. My DD was a huge help during and after chemo when we first moved here and in ongoing kinds of ways. She is very busy so any time is precious. My DGD loves her 18\" dolls so much. She asked permission to sleep on the living room floor with them. Her parents suggested they put the doll bed, (my old doll bunk beds from the 1950's) in her bedroom so they could all sleep in the same room. She is an only child as was recently overheard in doll play saying, \"Chistie did you use the scientific method?\" I continue to be amazed by her. I did something I have not done before. I don't go anywhere except the Onc , the Dentist and occasionally a local restaurant because I just cant walk, the muscle spasms are so bad in my back. I rented a wheel chair and had it delivered to my house! I went with my husband and friend to the Chihuley Museum at Seattle Center and it was wonderful, the glass was beautiful but just being out was stupendous! I have waited years now doing nothing and I know I must do more to get out. My friend was encouraging, she lives in VA. The house, we now have a fully fenced back yard of good size. I can just let the dogs out the back slider and down the stairs they go. It is always good to see you posting here and I hope you and others will check in again soon. Love Ginger",

I had such a bad time with the other pills that I want to get all the benefits I can. I do have thinning hair from Tamoxefen but I can live with that. My cousin who has BC again after many years, it turns out it was after twenty years! It is also a different kind, estrogen dependant this time. SHe is pretty sick and I hoope she makes it through. We are sort of settled in the house we moved to in May but not fully unpacked because we hope to purchase again this spring. The prices are going up rapidly here in the Seattle area which makes it more difficult to plan plus Chinese nationals are buying up, as investments,in all cash deals, the most desirable houses the day they come on the market. Many for more than the asking price. I saw one 2100 sq ft house come onto the market that had new roof, furnace, AC, Kitchen, baths etc all new. Closed on December 4 and rented for $2,900 a month, just one week later! Rents are zooming up too. It is crazy. My back still bothers me if I am upright, sitting is fine and well as reclining. Just atanding is the issue, muscles spasm reallu hard. I have become more of a recluse than ever/ I love when our Granddaughter is here. She is five and so much fun.

It apparently works though. Chemo left me with peripheral neuropathy and I still cannot feel anything on the bottom of my feet and my hands are slightly numb. I do still get electrical shocks in my feet and toes and arches. If micro infusions would have helped avoid this I would have liked that. I think my lack of steadiness on my feet mY BE RELATED TO ALL OF THIS. sORRY typos tremor causes me to bounce around the keyboARD. Did I tell you all I fell through the glass top of my big square coffee table. I was not injured but know I was very lucky and I hit my head on a newly opened box of faBRIc swatches. You can see my head inmpreesion in the box. I somehow fell when I got up to go to the bathroom., I turn left to do do that. I becamse aware when I was on my back in the ta ble and could hear the glass under me cracking and breaking. That is a sound I never want to hear again in my life. Later I discovered I must have fallen in on my left side, I had huge bruises on my shoulder, hip, knee and thigh. I was on my back when I became aware and have no idea how I even got on my left side from where I started. I must have passed out and spun around. Weird. So I am just donating the table and someone else can replace the top if they wish. We did buy the new, to us,house. We close in 10 days and move when we wish because we are renters and have alease that we have to honor. So costly but flexible. I am busy getting supplies to make the house as safe as I can. I have ordered strong grab bars for the bathrooms and showers. I am getting 3M anti slip runners to put on outside deck stairs, I am doing this for others because no way in hell am I going down those stairs! I am having two hand rails installed on the four front concrete stairs. I want them on both sides for safety and appearance. Inside the stairs up and down are wood. I checked all around and others say thaT CARPET IS SLIPPERY. sORRY CAPS AGAIN. i actually think I am going to go ahead and ruin the finish and put the 3M strips on the inside stairs. I dont care if I ruin the stairs as lonmgf as I don't fall down them. My DGD was in the NEW house on saturday when we did our final walk through. She is 5 years old and has big plans for the house. She will have a bedroom with her picket fence trundlke bed and a big cabinet for our dolls and a drop leaf table for us to play at. Downstairs we have a room , large that we palan to use for storage. Zoe has declared it the Jungle room and wants us to install vines for her to swing on in there. The new place is two blocks from her house so she is deliriously happy. My sewing room is going to be the lower level family room, Zoe will have her little theatre in there as well as her miniature sewing machines. Cast metal german made in the late 40's. Zoe is dying to sew for her 18\" dolls she gpot this Christmas. I had them for two and three years DD wouldn't let me give them to her earlier, SHE WAS LIKELY RIGHT. cAPS AGAIN. i THINK THIS TREMOR OIS GOING TO DRIVE ME CRAZY. i AM ALSO INSTALLING pull out drawers on the bottom lkitchen cabvinets. I can not crawl into those back cabinets. I actually set aside money for this, I think it is that important. I am excited about all of this. The house we are renting is nicer but having a place close to my DGD is the world to me. My husband is checkiing out the security systems, I told him I want to be able to see who is at any door. The neighborhood we are in is low crime so I am just wanting the extra security so I cN REACH OUT more eaisly. I am just not fast or strong anymore. When I was in physical therapy my therapist said, \"One fall can change your life.\" My firnds Aunt in her 80's fell this week while on a woalk with her husband. She broke her neck in three places and is now parALyzed! How awful for that woman and her family. I felt even more sure about not caring if I ruin the stairs to make them safe. I hoope Felicia and Whitney are both doing well and everyone is anticipating spring and getting ready to surround themselves with beautiful flowers. I love you all Ginger",

When the Doc stopped my chemo she knew what she was doing. My feet remain numb and my hands are more numb than before. I am left handed and my pinkie and ring finger hurt going up my arm toward my elbo if I use them more than a little bit.  I also became breathless, barely making it to the bathroom feeling all light headed. My taste has been so gone that I lost 17 pounds in just a few weeks, The Doc ordered a new Mugga scan and lab work. I am very fortunate, my labs are essentially normal. I am told that the 4 AC and 2 Taxol have just knocked me out. They said some people handle chemo pretty well but not me. I am just all dragged out.  Now it has been 4 weeks since my last chemo and my taste is a little improved and my breathing isn't so desperate. I still get breathless but not nearly as bad as just 4 days ago. I still don't understand why I get breathless though? Just because my body is so tired. I was told not to begin rads until after the new year, to get healthier first. I am okay with that for sure.  I am trying to read through but am only to page 112 so far. I thought I had better post or I would never get caught up!  I have missed you all and hope everyone is doing well, getting over SE, finding their MOJO if it is lost. WHat is a MOJO anyways? Did I have one? Hm?   My sense of humor is returning just a little bit, that is a very good sign for me. . My husband put up our tree, the branches arenbt fluffed out but I have colored lights three feet away from me and that makes me very happy. May be we will have ornaments too.............. I have shopped on line for most things, everything actually. The UPS truck actually came at 9:45 PM. I was so glad my husband was home because No ONe Ever comes up our drive at night. We cant be seen from the road at all.  UPS must have a lot of deleiveries to be out so late out in the area we are in. I need to stop tingly fingers are hurting now.  Laters, I love you all!!!! GInger PS This tingling hurts, it isn't a good feeling at all. It feels like itching sometimes and sort of like burning others. My feet are just numb, my hands are doing the tingle thing anbd I want it to go away! Thanks for letting me vent here. I would not have thought this could possibly be progressing four weeks after my last TAxol. ",

There is a new one where some tubes are inserted inside your breast under a local and you go twice a day for five days and then the tubes are removed on the last day.  It isnt the same as the one where the tubes are inserted during your surgery for lumpectomy, this is for later on. I am considering this because I have extremely fair skin and burn very easily and am concerned with the effect the rads will have on my skin. I hope you are healing well now.  GInger",

I will of course not P.M. you again. My P.M. was an attempt to open a private dialogue, not a \"calling out\" of any sort. I think in retrospect that I was actually not direct enough. I thought Lizzy meant the \"come back\" as cancer coming back and I couldn't understand why she would post such a thing after calling \"a discussion of a Lumpectomy for her ludicrous\". when she knew many of us had lumpectomies.   Perhaps that makes my P.M. more understandible. I had never heard of a \"comeback rate\" before, ever. I didn't know it was a financial term, that information would have led me to see her comment differently. . I have only written a few PM's in my time here. Some to welcome someone, others to ask a question, others to repsond to a question or invitation. I don't see P.M.s as dangerous but as a helpful tool.  Again, LizzyMack, I apologize for upsetting you. It was not my intent at all and would never be.  You quoted me as saying that \"Cancer is God's way of giving us time to say goodbye.\" That was actually a quote from my neurosurgeon when my father was dying of lung cancer. I appreciated it and shared it because of that. I hope no one leaves because of this interaction on our usually smoothly running topic. I think this is a very important topic and is where most of us settled when we were first here. This is the first topic I check when I log onto BC boards. This is where I have found much support, information and developed a bond with so many of our sisters. Blessings to all  Ginger",

I would think regarding hair color that the very most important thing, other than doing your patch test for an allergic reaction, would be to be certain your scalp is not irritated. No scrubbing or scratching your scalp for several days before applying color. Don't wash your hair the day of coloring it can make your scalp sensitive. Remember you are applying color to the hair only, do not rub it into your scalp, ever! One time I ran into a woman whose husband had applied her color for her. He rubbed the color into her scalp  because he thought it would make it last longer! Poor woman. I am toying with the idea of coloring my hair again because my kids think it makes me look old to have white hair. I think that is because every woman they know who has white hair has colored it a light blond. My 81 year old MIL has blond hair, so do all of her friends.  I loved my Grandma's white hair, I have the same hair. No yellow, just bright white. I will need to think about this.  GInger",

When I was in the throes of deprression I was like the living dead. I didn't answer the phone, or door. didn't open envelopes, didn't brush my teeth or bathe. My doc said I had it as bad as it gets. Had it been the time of electroconvulsive shock I am sure I would have been a candidate. Depression is incredibly serious. The first med I was on for it was welbutrin and I had very bad reaction within a few days and had to come off of it. I had most of the symprtoms that Calamitykel describes. The deep internal shaking was awful, headache, nausea, constipation, dizzyness, I was in a hotel when it really hit and I had to crawl to the bathroom. Doc took me directly off of it. Later did Paxil and then added Effexor. Now I am just on Effexor.  For me the Effexor is the best and I continue on now because I was told that seniors have a 90 or 95% chance of recurrance of depression, even though I only had one major depression. I was looking forward to being totally off but the BC convinced me to just go with it.  Lizzy, sun! I volunteer for a mission in Haiti. When I am in Haiti I automatically go to sleep at 10 PM and awaken about 6 AM. Like clockwork!   It is really amazing how automatic that is for me there. I feel better there, the humidity makes me feel alive, my hair curls into ringlets my skin is alive. My husband loves the climate in WA and I am grateful it is not 14 below zero tonight.I really need to get out my light box and use the thing. Has anyone heard from Texas? Calamity the doc I saw was a psychiatrist and they really do know the fine points of the various medicines and reactions to them. That was the only reason I saw a shrink so I would get properly medicated. I hope you feel better really soon. And affirming Lizzy, you will not get addicted, you need the meds.  ",

I had a complete hysterectomy at 51 years old. The doc made a mistake regarding huperplasia and told me later. Anyhow, I was always pretty nice but after the surgery I became really nice. Now It is hard to get me really upset about anything .I used to have PMS but no more.  I have also felt neutered since the surgery and that does bug me. Perhaps neuter is a better description, as in no drive. I took unopposed estrogen for about 13 more years after the surgery. Is that implicated in BC, sure, I wish I had't taken it. After I went off the estrogen my hair thinned and my skin changed. I have very few wrinkles but my skin terxture changed to coarser. I also lost some brain power once I was off the estrogen.  Being without ovaries without estrogen does absolutely have effects on women that seem to be too little recongnized. On the other hand the threat of recurrence would trump my side effects from hysterectomy anyday. Still though, there is a loss, another loss to bear. Sweeping it under the rug won't help. I hope you get lots of good help deciding how to proceed.  GInger",

You are a returning student so there may be something to get you prepared.  The local community college in Illinois had a massive nursing program and competition for entry was fierce. Lots of women attended general classes to get ready especially if they didn't have a solid high school background. I am really happy for you. I loved going to college! The best advice I was ever given in grad school was from a woman with 6 kids. She said to treat school like a job and study at the school.

Why not me? That is a difficult one to look straight at. We are all mortal yet we live as though we are not. Some survival mechanism seems to be in play that isn't helpful when faced with cancer or at least not at this particular point in treatment. I will improve. I was almost not going to post because I was feeling so ashamed of how I have been feeling.

I had one panic attack when my mom was in a nursing home. She told me she remembered my deceased father, but not ME!  I was sitting next to her, she was talking to me and saying she didn't really remember me. Then a little later I gave her this cool, candy apple red, walker wheeled thingy, with a seat, hand brakes, a pouch and a basket,  and even a car cup, totally cool and she threw up on it, then threw up on it again.  I thought I was okay until I got in the car and couldn't breathe. A panic attack is something I hope to never repeat too.  It takes a lot to stick to it with your docs's toget your meds right. Half the time I am really unsure what came when and if it is significant or not. You NP sounds tremendously helpful.I am sorry for the loss of your father. Lizzy my hair suddenly appeared on my fac last week. Everywhere I had thin almost ransparent haoir on my face previously suddenly grew in long. I felt like a stuffed animal and I shaved it off yesterday before chemo. I couldn't have considered tweezing it as I would still be there doing it there was so much. One the edgges of my mouth hairs that were white actually had some brown among them, yikes, what a shock.  I will welcome the return of any haiur in the basement so that my pee will be directed where it belongs agian!!!!  My husband is out of town weekdays again for the next three weeks. I am accoustomed to this after over thirty years of it but I am still not liking it.  I finished 24 out of 36 rads so far and then I go to Arimidex.  Not looking forward to any SE's from that. I started reading about it a bit and kind of wished I hadn't. My ROnc says to stay on these anti hormonals once we start because they do save lives and that too many women are stopping them and it is costing lives. Ohh. Hugs everybody. ",

It was about three weeks before chemo started and I sure hope it works. If my aunt and friend had not had it I wouldn't have persued it.  To help herself my friend used to fill the bathtub with ice cold water, get in, hold her nose, and submerg herself.   I don't know if this helps anyone or not but maybe it will be good info.

Me, my hair is still clown hair, out in little ringlets in all directions.  I go for my first physical, since long before BC,. tomorrow. I was supposed to go last month but blew it and had to wait a month to reschedule. I must go. I don't want to go. Has anyone else had their fingernails grow like crazy since being on Arimidex and all the vitamins? I look like I have painted on nails. Crazy, they are all long. ",

If you think attending the memorial this year will be too much for you then choose what works best for your own well being. A visit at another time might feel more personal. On the other hand the ceremonies might be healing. I have experienced both JFK's assasination and September 11th in my lifetime. While JFK's death was hard on me, September 11th  was profoundly more difficult. I think it may be because JFK was a political target and civilian innocents were the target of the September 11th murderers. I am not sure. Question, if you have a bilateral mastectomy does that mean you don't need to take the 5 year antihormonals?  Also, does the antihormonal only protect against recurrence in the breasts? How about distant spread?   I somehow don't have any info on this. Thanks ",

      "Content": "Oct 26, 2011 01:18PM - edited Oct 26, 2011 01:52PM by Gingerbrew Deb, your description of your endometrial biopsy, with vaccumning out all of the lining sounds more like endometrial ablation to me. I thought the biopsy was to take a plug or plugs of the lining and required dialating the cervex enough to get into the uterus. I am confused. Am I  mixing you up with someone else?  Anyhow what is it with some docs not using adequate pain measures? Perhaps we all need to make it a part of our plan to inquire and insist on pain killing measures in advance.  Minutes before my surgery I was taken to nuclear medicine. A Dr Nixon, in Winfield, Illinois did a sentinel node proceedure where radioactive material was injected around my nipples. The moron comes in, I am just before surgery and  anxious, and he quickly says, \"Don't you agree? We don't need to use (a numbing agent), we can just get it over with quickly and be done!\" There was no opportunity in that moment for dialog or consent for him to not use analgesia. When he began I was actually screaming, it hurt me so much! It felt like he was injecting fireballs into me. Now that I am closer to being myself again I think I should sue the sob, I was incredibly traumatized by his behavior and actions.  When I saw my surgeon at my followup, I told her what had happened and she was upset. She said it sounded like how it used to be done, and she was going to go have a \"conversation\" with him.When I arrived back in the pre operative area  I did not have the ability to tell her before surgery.  I was sedated very quickly when I got back to the pre surgery area and taken off to surgery. This was totally unnecessary torture. I have had two natural childbirths, walked back from the delivery room, had countless root canals and other painful proceedures experiences and nothing in any way touches what that proceedure with out pain medication did to me. Rant over, I probably shouldn't have put his name here, but I tell ya, I would love to have him come after me. I would love to face him across a courtroom. I think he should lose his license. How about that! Ginger",

With your little kids I bet you get outside pretty often. You are also young so it is my thought that you were outside a lot as a teenager. I could be way off on that though. . Up north it is just impossible to get enough D3. When I was tested my Onc in telling me the results said, \"well it isn't zero.\" I had 8 a score of 8. When 40 is low side of normal and people have 60 and 80 and more, I think 8 was just drastically low. I take D3 every day now. I take 5000 mg a day. It is also inexpensive. If my blood tests show D3 going up too high I will cut back. I think the recommended amount is something like 1200 mg a day for someone my age, 66. Someone knows the official numbers on here. DO YOU BELIEVE WE HAD SNOW AGAIN LAST NIGHT!!! I love it because it is so beautiful but I want to put up these window boxes I got and have actual flowers outside my kitchen windows.  I have this ideal climate in my head. It would get cold and snow on December 21st and it would melt on the 27th. Thereafter it would be warm in the 70's during the day and 60's in the evening. It would rain in the early early morning so it wouldn't interfere with our day. The heat would increase inJune and July for corn to grow, maybe into the 80's but the humidity would be low.  Then it would return to lovely 70's until Thanksgiving day when it would drop to the 50's for a little nip in the air. Return once again to the 70's until Santa was loading up his sleigh.  I think this world might be in Santa Barbara but who can afford to live there?  LAters Ginger",

Honest to God I am rather normal except for this.  My Sweet 8 year old DGD has the same sleep problems. I was at my DS house and he is so used to his daughters night terrors that when I woke them up screaming on night he sat up in the bed and then said. \"Oh it's just mom.\"   I wake up so exhausted sometimes. I like to find the humor but truthfully it isn't very funny too me.  My poor dogs look just stunned whan they see me like this.   I have had this my entire 66 years.

I will still be happy to see them.  There are SO many shows on Broadway that I would love to see but can't imagine I will get there.  Laters Ginger  Hugs Ginger ",

These past couple weeks now I have been having them every other day! The only change I can see is that it is dark earlier and I see the TV reflected off the front window and in the past flickering reflections have been a trigger for me. We put a piece of cardboard in the window to block the reflection I hope it works.  Back in Illinois we would have closed the drapes, here it is so dark that many if not most people don't even use draperies, just blinds.

Zoe really like that the doll has underpants because she is very involved with those these days. Zoe can be very serious. I put up this photo of my DGD on Fuzzies Romp Room, a thread I stop in at from time to time. I will try to add it here too.  So happy to hear that Texas is in remission again. Happy dance for that one!   I certainly hope for good options for Sweeny, sorry to hear her test results. Let us know Lizzy of you hear anything please.   Rachel. 11 years old. That is a nice age for a boy. Very handsome young man. Stewie is indeed a standard poodle. My husband got him for me when chemo was over. He has trained him though and Stewie just thinks I am someone to mooch off of and keep warm next to at night. He is doing wonderful on  obedience training. He is one of those dogs who sort of prances walking at heel, really pretty. Our auxillary dog Harry needs a haircut so badly that I wont photograph him just now.  I still am having migraine issues. Doc said mets would present differently so that is good, I think. The migraines have just reallly stepped up in rate 6 in 12 days. The Sumatripan (I think imitrex generic) works very well. The increase had started b efore I began this drug, so it isn't from that. I am off Aromasin for a while to see if that is doing it.   Lizzy, surely you know some female lawyers to discuss law school realities with. What area of law are you thinking about?  I would personally question how much of my life I would be wiling to give over to a profession now.  If I could afford to work in the area I wished, probably, hah certainly, at greatly reduced pay then I might give it a go. My BIL and SIL are attorneys and I think they gave up a lot for it. They have plenty of compensation but the hours they had to exchange for that are ones I would not.   I believe you could do this, you are so smart and have shown you have the ability and drive to work in that environment. I know ytou will think this through and if it is standard old fear you will jump right over that, however if it is pulling you away from another life that you want I beleive you are wise and will respect that.  Love Ginger ",

I am really relieved.   My blood work was also good and my kidney? was better than before, what ever that means. My Dexa scan was very good, not as good as two years ago but still very good. My mom had two broken hips and a shoulder so I was concerned and am relieved. I could hear you all cheering. I am to start on tamoxofen now. Onc thinks I may tolerate it better, I hope so, I would like to be able to take this helper to keep away recurrance. I will give it serious time and try to continue.     My Onc referred me to a Psychologist who works with cancer patients after they end active treatment, like me. I am just not reengaged in life, I tend to just watch tv even though there are things I would like to do. My Onc says it isn't uncommon but I know it needs to be different or I will regret it big time.   I did go to my first painting class on tuesday afternoon. I met some friendly women, all of whom are working at different levels and I am a rank beginner. My DGD liked my practice sheet, she said, \"Gamma, this is beautiful!\" I loved it.  Now I need to keep going, it is strangely difficult for me to go anywhere at all.

I slept from about 11 PM until they awakened me at 6 AM.  I used a ton of shampoo to get the goop off of me and out of my hair.  It was actually a good bed and quiet room, nice tech and decent shower too.  I will get the results in two weeks.  The tech did tell me I didn't do anything \"interesting\"  my husband was sad about that but hopefully my brain waves will tell them something so I stop screaming in the night.  My poor husband.   I hope you are all doing well and have a nice weekend.  Love GInger",

She is 2 2/3 now.  We are going to plant a little set of three planters tomorrow about 2' x 2' with seeds. I think Zoe will like it and I think I can manage it. They have wheels and a cover that fits over and you make an x cut where the plants come though.   My plan is to put copper tape around the planter just above each of the wheels so the D*** slugs don't come up there.  wE HAVE GIGANTIC SLUGS OUT HERE. .  Caps, while appropriate were unintentional.  I am now on Tammoxafen  for 5 weeks and feel 100% better than I did on Arimidex or Aromasin.

I went right back to sleep. It amazes me that he still sleeps in the same room with me given my midnight night terrors. Lately I have apparently been trying to punch something, I never remember the content, not like a dream that I do remember sometimes. I am a strange sleeper. Good news is no mets, however, it turns out I have a broken back, L1 , not C1,compression fracture with stenosis. Loss of height on several vertebrae from impact. Hard impact trauma is how you get compression fractuers if not from disease like osteoporosis. Lots of other spine issues too. No wonder I have been hurting some much that I can't walk anywhere except to the bathroom since September 3. I now have an appointment with an Orthopedic surgeon on Feb 6, his first available. I am pretty tired of sitting at home 24/7. I can walk to my car, it hurts but I can make it, like I count my steps and think walk faster it wont hurt for so long. It works and gets me there. The thing is there is not really anywhere to go. I used to pick up DGD until this past week from preschool and the teachers put her in her car seat and then we would go back to my house until DD picked her up. Now she is staying for after school group and tea time. I just miss her so much. DD realized she would regain an hour of at home time if she didnt need to come pick up DGD at our house. I understand but sure miss DGD.  Funny, last week she told me her school has a soccer team and she would need to get a haircut before the first game. She is 3 1/2. lol ",

Now I am told to stop, that is a big shift of gears.  I am happy  that many of you are finishing up! Calamity!!! Texas, hopin for keys to come your way soon. Iowa,Sweeny, LizzyMAck, WHerria everybody!!!!    Hugs to you all. Ginger",

I do know the Neulasta acted very differently with Taxol. Seriously onn tx 2 of Taxol I began they Oxy and muscle relaxant before I took the chemo and meds to stay out front of the SE's.  I was pretty scared about ending early and my Onco is so patient and thoughtful in the way she presents info and options that I really appreciate it. Doc said if my neuropathy reverses in a week maybe a reduced dose but she looked very doubtful.  I sure can't feel any reversal at this point. May all SE stay away from Calamity, Amen Ginger",

It is internal and is put in under a local and you go two times a day for 5 days and the thingy is removed on day 5.  So I was poking around and saw a paper that mentioned it is quickly becoming more widely used because of its convenience, however its efficacy hasn't been proved. This was an abstract so I didn't get to read the entire paper. It did give me serious pause for thought. I really do not want a recurrence and if 5 weeks plus a couple more days is proven I suppose I will go with that. I will keep looking around though.  Hugs everyone Ginger",

Our daughter had so many great opportunites because of it  and went on to high school very fresh for learning. She was valedictorian and went on to college and grad school. We had so much fun following her interests that developed in those years. We saw lots of theatre and a friend let her use the electron microscope at a university. We had lots of museums available to us and we joined them as members and so would have access to special classes. Instead of just reading about verious topics she was able to dive into them and explore with more depth. I remember those years so well, what an amazing time it was for us. I hope your adventure with your children is blessed. PS My DD learned her fractions by multiplying recipes for christmas cookies and converting the ingredients into a shopping list of appropriate quantities. We used to make 100 dozen each Christmas to use for gifts.  I think practical applications really speed learning. I go to the radiologist for the first time tomorrow. I am not looking forward to it, I still have numb feet and hands and fall over far too easily because of it. I also just don't want to get back into the treatment cycle and have burns on me. I know I dont have to like it, I just have to show up.  This is not a trip I wanted to take. Yes, it is normal to feel bad at the end of treatment. and at the beginning too.  Ginger",

Try to take someone with you so they can take notes. My team here at the Seattle Cnacer Care Alliance in Seattle records that fist team meeting and gives you a DVD of all of the conversations.  Bring a recoder human of electronic along with you so you can look back at the infor you have been given.  Ask for an oncology nurse, i.e. your Docs nurse, to guide you through this, she will be invaluable.  Look to the medical information parts of this web site for more info. I don't find Doc Google very helpful but here at BCO I have found huge amounts of information to help me over these past 2 3/4 years.  Look around the site, figure out how to make this place your home.   Hugs Ginger",

I am on 150 mg of Effexor now and all remains quiet. Perhaps you need a change of antidepressant to one less likely to interfere.  Good luck to you",

You may mess up the color for any number of reasons but not due to the hair being somehow alive like skin is.  Anyhow, I am 67 and my hair is indeed that white brilliant white color. It started turning when I was 16 and I colored for 48 years. When my hair grew back in it was totally white, I didn't realize it had gone totally over. It was also straight, after always having curly, wavy hair I had straight hair!   White hair is more resistant to taking color than any other hair color. I can't imagine using a semi permanent color and getting a good result.  I am near to going back to color and know I will need a permanent color like Loreal Preference or Loreal Excellence. I tried to color one time after my hair came back in but used too light a color of blonde. I need to use a blond that is not in the super, extra light blond or you won't see the color. I sort of hate the idea of going back to the every three or four week color cycle again. On the other hand I know the bright white ages me now, as I look so old since chemo. I also only see very old women with white hair except for a few forty year olds who have young faces.     Comments welcome Ginger",

I found comfort in that because I figured the Docs would know all about it.  You will see the surgeon in two days, yes?  Be sure to tell the surgeon you are having pain just so she can take a look and make sure all is as is expected.  Don't be looking at any stats just yet. You don't have enough information for them to be at all meaningful. Some people like to look when they can put all the variables in. Me, I have only broad information and that has worked out okay for me.   You can find some threads on here of women who were diagnosed the same time as you, or began chemo or rads at a certain time. I like my groups that I go to beacuse we had the same things going on and really undestood one another. I hope that for you too.    Take care of yourself, prayers, love and hugs Ginger",

A family history of Breast Cancer or lack thereof isn't a big indicator.  Inflamatory breast cancer has a rash as one of its symptoms, in some people. Now that feels like TMI to me! I don't want to frighten you but going to see a Doc about the rash is important.  The odds against it being breast cancer are huge.  I am reluctant post this, but I am concerned about that rash. My first symptom was an itchy spot.  Hugs Ginger",
