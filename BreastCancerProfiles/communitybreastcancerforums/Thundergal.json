Let us know how you're doing when you're able! New_me, Diane - calming thoughts to you as you prepare for your surgeries tomorrow. Stepmish - I'm so glad your surgery is over. Let's hear it for negative lymph nodes!! Let your body rest and check in when you're able. Mominator - I hope you're recovering a bit now that your surgery is over. Marie711 - I'm so sorry you're having to deal with the double whammy of two diagnoses and two surgeries - it really stinks. Hang in there - you can DO this! Next Wednesday is my BMS with tissue expanders. Dye injection Tuesday afternoon. AS the big day gets closer, I feel like the emotional roller coaster I've been on for the last 6 weeks has moved into hyper speed with no predicabiity as to what/who may set me off. Hubby is wonderfully understanding. Aftrer reading through the posts of many of you, I took your advice and asked my doctor for something to help with the agitation/anxiety and lack of sleep. Skeptical though I was, I have to say it's making a positive improvement for me! I hate taking these medicines, but I realize they are for a situational experience and aren't forever. I have to say, though, the Effexor (antidepressant) was suggested to my by my OB-GYN as having strong ability to decrease night sweats. After just a few days of starting this medicine, last night was the first night in 6 weeks that I didn't have to change jammies at least once during the night - YAY! Reading through these threads has been my support system since early October, when I was diagnosed. We are strong, funny, scared, motivated, intelligent and tremendously loving women. Most of all, I think we are fierce! Thanks for all of the support! Catherine",

Since I wrote earlier this week, I feel like I've been on a roller coaster. Just when I felt somewhat ok with knowing the surgery date, etc, my surgeon called yesterday to say the tumor board ( the group of oncologists, radiologists, plastic surgeons, etc that meet weekly to review their cases collaboratively) met yesterday and saw a spot on the MRI in my left (supposedly healthy) breast. I'm waiting to learn when it will be biopsied under MRI. I wonder, if it is cancer, can it be a different kind than I have in my right breast? Has it spread to the left breast? I'm also really light headed and woozy and can't help but wonder if it's related. Does any of this sound familiar to anyone",

I've been plowing though closets, cleaning the refrigerator and drawers like a madwoman. This weekend's task- setting up my closet to make sure I can reach my cozy PJs and comfy clothes after surgery. All of this nesting is a nice distraction from what's up ahead. MRI assisted biopsy next week of a newly discovered \"suspicious\" area in my L breast (the supposedly healthy one!). Hugs, hugs and hugs to all of the ladies recovering from last week's surgeries!! TallnTerrific - thanks for being our calendar queen- it's so nice to be able to see everyone's scheduled surgery in one place!",
