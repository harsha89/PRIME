My lumpectomy was January 9, but I got a huge hematoma, ended up in the hospital and had a second surgery on the 12th.  During the second surgery they removed a liter of blood and clot and fluid, so it was definitely a good thing to have done.  Unfortunately, the incision opened while healing and now it is healing from the inside out.  I have one deep cavern about the size of a thumbprint and one small one next to it.  My surgeon has been keeping a close eye on it and he promises that it is healing (I sure hope so!). I'm almost done with my AC chemo (final infusion is tomorrow morning) and then moving on to 12 weeks of Taxol and Herceptin.  I'm 47, no kids, no hubby, but a very supportive sister and some good roommates that are going above and beyond to help me through this. ",
