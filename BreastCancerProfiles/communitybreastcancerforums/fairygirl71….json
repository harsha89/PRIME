The only hair that has some growth is on my head, but it is thin and wispy and I still feel like I look like a cancer patient. I am beginning to loose hope of ever growing it back. Has anyone else had trouble regrowing hair? Any suggestions? My nails grow like crazy though so I am a little confused. I thought It would have regrown by now.",
