My CA 27-29 came back at 40, they have always been above 30, but this scared the daylights out of me. My MO ordered CT scan and/pelvis/chest, done on June 8, results on June 11. \"small 1 mm nodule right posterior liver, low attenuation, follow up scans to rule out mets\" and 4 nodules on lungs, all less than 4 mm. I have a bone scan Friday. All labs are normal (bili, calcium, alt, all phos). Scared to death. Trip negative is a beast...anyone have any insight to talk me down?",
