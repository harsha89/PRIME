I didn't want them as a reminder of all this either and had read about others using permenant marker and clear tape instead of tats. So I went in to my simulation ready to discuss this with my RO. He preceeded to bully me into getting them...wouldn't do the rads without them, and said I needed to keep them in case of recurrence. Well that set me off for about a week constantly worrying about my odds of having a recurrence. My husband was so pissed, he demanded a new doc and is making a big stink with the hospital administration. My new MO is great, answers all my questions and listens to my concerns. He says no I don't have to keep the tats...with today's digital records they can easily replicate whatever they might need...I just need to wait until about six weeks after I complete radiation before having any laser removal done. I guess it doesn't take much to remove them...a single zap with a laser usually does it. And supposedly a lot of plastic surgeons will do it for free for BC patients. I'm planning to talk to my plastic surgeon when I have my follow up apptment with him when I finish rads in a month. I'm also looking for hair color suggestions. I'm happy starting with a temporary or semipermanent color, but am having a hard time finding blond colors. Everything has peroxide. Have you done Nioxin yet? I'm curious if it really works.",

All my other docs were so great that this just blindsided me. And what really pisses me off is that the RO also said I needed the tattoos in case of recurrence. Like I need to hear that! Okay, I'm going to stop ranting. We will get through the rads and then have the tats removed (and if my husband has his way, the hospital will cover it)! And I will take your advice and drink lots and lots of water. Thanks again!",

I'm a little over three weeks out and the last couple of days it seems my hair is getting oilier faster. It didn't get hugely dry during chemo but it was drier than normal. I can't tell if it is the warmer weather or if my hair is starting to revert back to its pre-chemo state. Do you think it would be okay to start washing every other day instead of every third day? Still using cool water, of course.",

I was supposed to start this week but there was a huge screw up with scheduling when I went in for my simulation...my RO walked in and had no idea why I was there and had no plan worked up yet (even though I had met with him previously and had made this appt a month earlier). Then I tried to discuss with him about alternatives to getting the placement tattoos. He preceded to bully me into getting them by telling me they wouldn't do it any other way. I should have stood my ground and I feel terrible that I didn't. My DH, my knight in shining armour, has complained to the department manager and insisted we get transfered to another doctor, which we have. Still I now have these three blue dots that don't look like freckles, no matter what the doc says. I now start next Tuesday.",

I should have walked out but this is the only game in town when it comes to radiation here (I live in a beautiful but small town in Northern Michigan and I'd have to drive several hours every day to get to the next closest radiation center). And you're right, the tats are really just for the convenience of the techs, so I don't know why he was being such a jerk about it. I was shocked that he was so set against it. We plan to make a formal complaint to the hospitals patient ombudsman. Maybe we can get the policy changed. Thank goodness my MO wasn't like this about cold caps. He was skeptical but at least supportive and even had a nurse do some research on it for me. I'm glad he's the one I'll be seeing over the next few years. -- Bethany",

I am three months out and have colored my hair once with a temporary rinse at 7 weeks (it looked great for about ten days and then just went blah) and took the full plunge two weeks ago with Clariols Natural Instincts. I wanted to do it at home because I don't have a regular stylist and I didn't feel like explaining all about why my hair has special needs. It turned out great and didn't seem to speed up shedding at all...I'm down to losing only 10-30 hairs a day and that didn't change at all after coloring. Have TONS of new hair coming in all over my head and elsewhere. Once the new hair got long enough to lie flat and not stick straight up, the texture seemed comprable to what it was before...it doesn't seem to be coming in more curly or any more grey than it was before so I'm happy about that. Now it is is just a matter of waiting for the new growth to catch up with everything else. As everyone says, don't expect to keep your same hair, but you will have hair. So, while I don't have the prettiest hair right now, I do have hair and I am happy about that.",
