I've just started on radiation and will have 16 whole-breast sessions and 4 boosts. I've been told it's the shorter \"Canadian Protocol\". I'm getting IMRT - which involves many individual radiation beams that deliver modulated doses that pinpoint areas in the breast-scape and increases or decreases the amount of radiation accordingly. Although a shorter treatment time, the results equate with longer treatments. And here's the kicker for me - because of the shorter time, I can expect less side effects. I've had 4 treatments so far. I didn't ask for IMRT, it's just what my RO does. Often, insurance will cover the longer conventional 3D-CRT radiation treatments but not IMRT. I told him that my insurance company doesn't automatically approve IMRT and he said he uses IMRT no matter what the insurance company pays. IMRT is considered new in the US. When I asked him what figures into treatment planning, among other things he told me, in the US, ROs were typically paid according to the amount of treatment sessions - unlike their Canadian counterparts. That's why it took so long to catch on here. I looked at him quizzically and he smiled and said he was salaried and the amount of treatments had no effect on his paycheck. I like this guy. So that's what I know about the reasons for my treatment so far. ChattyKat, I wonder if your RO simply doesn't have the machinery that can do the shorter dose?",

I think anything less than the traditional 25 or more treatment sessions and that uses IMRT can be considered \"the Canadian Protocol\". It's a wonder your RO can't explain it any better to you. I'll check back in a bit and we can compare our experiences. Here's hoping for smooth sailing Anyone else out there want to chime in about IMRT and the Canadian Protocol?",
