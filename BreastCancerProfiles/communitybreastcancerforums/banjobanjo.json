I'm just sending cards this year - in the last six months, my husband had a silent heart attack, which was found luckily on a normal medical ECG.  When he went into hospital for a heart catheter procedure to find out what the blockage was, I drove home (Germany) to find that my father had died in England an hour before. I managed four days in England to help my mother with all the bureaucracy, then back to Germany for my husband's triple bypass operation, then back to England for the cremation.  After looking after my husband through his recovery, he was one day away from being fully signed off by his cardiologist as fit and that was the day I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer with spine and brain mets.  All this in six months - I'm not putting that out in other people's Christmases.  The ones who need to know, know.  The rest will just get cards - I don't want them to know.  Merry Christmas, whatever your solution!

Having chosen Mozart, I actually thought they were going to ask 'opera or orchestral?' but no, on went the headphones and into the machine.  Of course, I heard nothing of the music over the loudness of the machine except when the machine stopped grunting for a pause and then I would hear a few seconds of delicate Mozart and then wham! back to the grunting. Next time I think I'll ask for heavy metal...  Is it a German thing to go into such detail when you can't even hear the stuff?",

Jintski, I am thinking a lot about you and hoping for the best.  Trust the oncologist if you can - the side effects of radiation are peculiar and long-lasting and it is so tempting to think that the brain mets are causing things which they are not (that was the reason for my scan today - my local doctor had thought the ear pain came from the brain mets - thank goodness she was wrong). ",

It was done using the 'pink ribbon app' and the message is 'We're all in this together'.  This made me angry because she's not 'in' anything except the vulnerability that comes with being female.  The only people I can accept are in this with me are the Stage IV women. This particular friend exhibits behaviour that I've noticed in a few others - she questions me and checks on my progress like she would check a barometer for the weather.  Thanks goodness she is in England and I am in Germany, which means I only have to be message-polite and not actually see her in person, so the danger of strangulation is fairly small. What I feel she is doing with her pink support and her pink fun runs is providing herself with a kind of personal insurance against getting breast cancer - the more she works for us, the less likely it is that she will be punished with cancer. In case any of you think I'm being too hard on her, I'll just say that I never found her much of a friend when she lived here and I was healthy, so nothing has changed.  Barbara 'And we are here as on a darkling plain, swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.

I waited to get back to Germany and went to my oncologist.  He sent me for x-rays, the radiologist said there were no fractures and he could see NO METASTASES.  I had already told him that my last spine MRI was stable and that this was an injury but he was concentrating on the cancer.  So I still don't know what I've done, can't get an appointment with an orthopaedic practice (health care is brilliant in Germany but you can wait a long time for orthopaedic care; they are so busy) and can't move on to neurologist until I've seen an orthopaedic doctor.  Still in pain, still eating painkillers and still no answers.  My right leg feels as though it belongs to somebody else and the pain has now gone right up my back to in between my shoulders - I'm fed up with hurting.

I woke on the Monday feeling bad and took the morning tablet. From then on I felt like I was dying - horrendously nauseous, not quite conscious, my head kept falling with my mouth open but I couldn't sleep, itchy skin, felt too awful.  I honestly thought this was the end and my husband just sat quietly in the corner of the bedroom because I couldn't bear to have anyone touch me.  Towards the early evening when the tablet started to wear off, I began to feel better but even Tuesday I felt wobbly even though I refused to take any more tablets. Later, we read up about this drug - apparently about half the people given it react in the way I did to some extent.  What kind of doctor would give such a strong drug to someone on chemo?  I just wanted something a bit stronger than Ibuprofen, not to be knocked out.  It frightened the hell out of me and I just wanted to warn anyone about the possible and quite common reaction that can happen.  I am sure it is a very effective painkiller for those who can tolerate it but be careful - you might not be able to. Going to see the oncologist on Friday about my spine to see if anything can be done.

But you miss them, naturally.  I don't know if you would feel able to talk to them about the situation but sometimes I think open frankness can work very well.  If you could invite them round for coffee and cake and make a point of telling them that you miss them and feel that your illness is getting in the was of your friendships, it would get the subject into the open air and they could perhaps talk about how they might be nervous around you, don't know when to include you or not.  The outcome could be at least a regular get-together that doesn't include other people, just you and these friends.  I am sure they are still friends and still care for you - it's just that they don't have cancer.  But I bet they would respond if they knew you were hurting.  You have nothing to lose that you haven't already lost.

I have two or three people who are very close friends and know everything about my diagnosis and treatment.  I have a small circle of good friends who know pretty much everything, although I have not told them about my brain mets yet, and they are a welcome embrace of normality who still see me as ME.  Outside that are the friendly acquaintances who I keep at a conversational distance in that I would rather hear about them than they hear about me.  I find most people love talking about themselves and what they've done and that if I say 'I'm fine' and then follow up with a question about their son/daughter/husband etc, they get distracted from me.  That's how I like it. What I do resent is that one friend I have known for 18 years had already drifted apart and it was quite a natural thing in that our children kept us in contact and are now grown and her interests and hobbies are very different to mine.  I accepted that we had naturally grown apart and I wasn't bothered.  However, when she heard from someone that I had cancer, she had a long telephone call with me and said she would visit.  I didn't hear any more for six months - then I got a call and she came round for coffee.  She stayed two hours and was very interested in my treatment and progress.  She entertained me with horseriding stories (she hunts and is training to do dressage) and I asked if I could come and see her compete.  She said she would call me to give me details of the next competition. That was months ago; I haven't heard from her since.  I feel I was some kind of interesting chemistry experiment - that she wanted to see what cancer had done to me but didn't want to have real contact.  I will probably hear from her if I'm alive in six months because she will want to observe the next stage.  Well, I'm a test tube that doesn't want to be observed so she'll get short shrift from me. ",

I didn't get a lot of satisfaction out of the questions I took - isn't it weird that you think you are asking clear questions and you get answers to them but they are not really answers?  I went in thinking I was going on Herceptin and Tykerb, which is what he had mentioned in October but in November he got test results for me which said I was triple negative (previous test had said HER+), so I was feeling wrong-footed and taken aback and didn't know anything about Zeloda other than having heard the name on these boards. Now I see that Zeloda is usually taken in conjunction with another drug for most effective results and extended life - I am to take it on its own and don't know whether this means that the oncologist doesn't believe I am worth 'extending' or whether he believes that Zeloda alone will be effective enough. Radiation and chemo side effects have improved hugely the last few days and I am able to eat and actually enjoy food again so life is looking up.  I don't feel I have any real options other than to take the Zeloda and get on with it - going with the flow and hoping that it works out.  Barbara 'And we are here as on a darkling plain, swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.

Consequently, I haven't been here to find out your results.  I am so sad that it wasn't migraines, which we all hoped it was.  When I was diagnosed, I thought I only had spinal mets because the doctor held back on the brain mets info until I'd had my mastectomy and he thought I could take more bad news - in fact, let's face it, the worst kind of news.  I'd got through the op easily and was dealing with the idea of a damaged spine and hoping they could repair it in some way and was positive.  Then brain mets seemed the death blow.  I wondered why they had bothered doing a mastectomy if I had brain mets because of course I would die very soon.  But the doctors thought I was worth investing in and the brain mets were just something else for them to treat.  My oncologist always says that I am not in a war against cancer but a series of separate battles fought on different fronts. In fact the WBR I had worked well and has given me more time.  Brain mets, although a terrible idea, end up being something else on the list of what we need to accept.  I remember my shock, my feeling of dread at losing my mind, my personality, etc.  But in the end I just got up in the morning and went to bed at night and realised that I wasn't going to die yet.  You're like all of us, alternately strong and wobbly, but when they decide how they are going to treat you, you will start to deal with it.  Please don't give up.  Barbara x ",

I really hope you get to meet Apple - she's probably the best medication available - and no side effects... ",

      "Content": "Jul 14, 2012 02:39AM - edited Jul 14, 2012 02:42AM by banjobanjo The problem is that 'alternative' covers a large range from acceptable complementary treatment to downright weird suggestions with miracle results - you have to draw your own line where one stops and the other begins. It seems clear to me that if anyone claims that an alternative treatment (however weird) has the ability to cure cancer, then they should be happy to undergo clinical trials, tests and have at the end scientifically acceptable proof of their claim.  Instead, most of these suggestions are preying on people who are full of fear, some of whom want to believe so badly that they will try anything.  I can go with chemo because although it will not cure us, there is scientific evidence that in most cases it has a life-extending effect.  When I have scientific proof that an alternative treatment has a life-extending effect, then I will be prepared to try it but most of the people promoting such things flee at the first sign of investigation. My other point is that physicians have a goal which is to heal and I do not support the 'conspiracy against a cure' theory. If they had good reason to believe in a specific alternative treatment, they would use it but only if trialled and proven.  They want us to get better if only they knew how.  I am very sad about my diagnosis but am not gullible enough to give money to someone who is exploiting my sadness.  Of course, we should eat as healthily as we can, but then so should everyone...",

It seems there are two problems - firstly, you have had enough suffering from side effects of chemos and secondly, you don't feel these chemos are working, which makes the suffering not worthwhile.  I don't know how many other chemo options are out there for you, but I suspect that if they changed your treatment and could find an alternative that was gentler on you (or they could combat the side effects with other drugs), then you would probably pick up again and see the point of carrying on.  Physically feeling rotten is psychologically very wearing -  I remember my first aggressive chemo course and lying on the sofa thinking I would never be well again and what was the point of feeling so awful all the time?  Of course, as soon as things got better I became more positive but at the time I was ready to give up and I had only just started.  It must be much worse for you as you have had bad side effects for a long time - I admire your endurance. I hope a talk with your oncologist will communicate how bad you are feeling and prompt him/her to explore any treatments which you haven't tried yet and wish you the very best of luck. Barbara ",

What has helped me is the understanding of the people on this site, all of us sharing the mixture of terror, sadness, anger and hope.  The strength of personality and human spirit I have found here has lifted me to where I am able to really enjoy the beauty of every day, day by day, and the horror only occasionally makes an appearance.  Really good advice and help here - hope you benefit too.",

Then move on to what can be, not what can't be. I'm a similar age, 59 (for a few more weeks...), and I understand the grandchildren thing; don't expect I'll be here to see any.  In fact, my youngest daughter has said she doesn't think she wants children and I'm wondering if this is true or if she's just saying it to make me feel better.  But there is so much other stuff to look forward to and I don't mean a bucket list of events.  I mean just the months, possibly years ahead that we get to enjoy our families, friends, nature, our homes.  I don't want to do anything or go anywhere exciting - I just want an everyday life and to feel well as long as I can.   Don't want any of the above to sound preachy but I remember the panic I was in when diagnosed and I got through it by acceptance and adjustment but it took quite a while and I didn't think I could carry on but 'take one day at a time' seems to be the best advice I had. There's always someone here not only to listen but also, amongst this group, you will find all sorts of advice from women who have been here a while.  So let us know how you are doing, you are one of us.",

Good luck, let us know how you get on, Barbara ",
