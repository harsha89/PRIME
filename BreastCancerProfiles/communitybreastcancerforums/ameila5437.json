It doesn't really seem that other than looking at tumor marker bloodwork there is really any good way to see if the chemo/herceptin is actually doing anything.   Does anyone's onc plan on doing a PET scan post-chemo to \"check\" around, particularly if you are early stage and/or not in lymph nodes? Also, my CA 27.29 (CAG27) score jumped to 60.7 U/mL just before first chemo, when presurgery baseline was 28.9 U/ML.  My doc says \"refererence range\" is to be under 38.6.  I dropped back to 42.7 before Chemo#3.  Just wondering if anyone else is monitoring this number.  My onc seemed unconcerned, said sometimes the chemo causes the numbers to jump around a bit.  alternatively, my Carcinoembryonic AG (CEA) scores have all been less than 0.5 ng/mL, which appears to be normal range.  Not sure which (if either) test is more important and am curious what others' experiences have been. Overall, side effects seem to be more prevalent from about day 3 post chemo to about day 12-14 post-chemo, with fatigue, some fever, metallic tastes and less saliva, hot flashes, constipation and that kind of thing.  I feel lucky no nausea.   I've been trying to drink a lot of water, eat healthy and walk at least 1-3 miles a day (I was running half marathons before being diagnosed, but running seems beyond me right now).  I'm not perfect at it, but that's my goal.  And staying active with my 15 year old and 12 year old.  I did decide to take a short leave from work to minimize my stress, and that has been a good decision, although I still work a little bit from home.  Will likely go back to 40 hour work weeks once I finish last chemo. So interested to hear from others and appreciate so much all that eveyone shares.  i'm not really a support group kind of person, and so the message boards are wonderful!",
