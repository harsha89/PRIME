From waiting for the results of a biopsy, to seeing a surgeon, to deciding on treatment and reconstruction, it is all completely overwhelming. And many decisions have to be made quickly with little time for reflection. I was a basket case for months. It is useful to consider anything that will help. I did not take drugs (no one offered them -- I guess because I seemed outwardly to be coping even though I really wasn't). I tried a couple of therapy sessions but didn't find it was all that helpful. What really helped me was guided meditation. I found an excellent coach and saw her twice a week for several months. I found it really helped with the stress and mental trauma. The important thing is to find what works best for you. I wish you all the best.",

My oncologist at a comprehensive cancer center (most rank it 1 or 2 in the nation) felt I should not do chemo.  The rest of the breast oncology staff was divided with some thinking I should be offered light chemo (CMF).  I consulted another oncologist in another state (who I know to be very aggressive).  He said no chemo and said he would not do it if he were in my situation.  He said the risks from chemo (including chemo brain) were not worth the very slim benefit I might get from it.  I also consulted a world reknown breast oncologist in another country (I left no stone unturned!).  He said I could do CMF but that I had an excellent prognosis without it.  Dh did not want me to do chemo unless at least one doctor said I needed to do it.  None did.  So, I didn't do it.  My oncologist at the major cancer center told me not doing chemo was absolutely the right decision.  Although I did not do chemo, I have completely changed my eating habits and exercise regularly.  I have lost 55 pounds and now have a BMI below 25.  So, I am hopeful.  I am probably one of the few women posting here who chose not to do chemo even though it was offered. ",

Now that I'm nearly a year out from surgery and back to work, I think people occasionally look at me and remember, \"Oh, she's the American who had breast cancer.\"  But, I don't think people focus on it all the time. My experience was similar to Docbabs'.  Everyone was very supportive.  I had people of all religions putting me on prayer lists in various places around the world, which was very kind and comforting although I am not personally very religious.  I, too, found out that many women would respond that they had had BC.  One woman had been treated 20 years ago.  I belong to a women's group that meets every couple of months, and I was serving on the board of directors at the time of my diagnosis.  It turned out that, counting me, five of the ten women on the board had had BC.",
