Some sort of genetic test was performed on the tissue they removed which indicated that there was a very low likelihood of a recurrence. You might ask your surgeon about such a test. Both my surgeon and my oncologist agreed that I did not need radiation or anything else except careful monitoring. I agreed with them and will do nothing else. I am 79 years old with a number of other health problems. If I were much younger I might do things differently but for me this is the best way to go.",
