I was in remission for many years on just Herceptin, after my bout with liver mets. Thinking I might be cured, I decided to take a Herceptin vacation. The cancer returned to my liver, big time, in just one year. So, because Taxotere had worked to get rid of my liver mets in 2001/2002 I decided to try it again along with Herceptin. It was working very well, but unfortunately I wasn't able to tolerate it for more than about 4 months before the SE's became too much. My doctor at the time wanted to add Perjeta, but my insurance (Blue Shield) denied it because I had already been heavily treated for MBC. I was able to get the Perjeta through Genentech's patient access program, and then, when I eventually switched to Kaiser for my insurance, they had no problem keeping me on the Herceptin and Perjeta because it was working! So, I was on that combo for almost 3 years before I had my most recent recurrence. I am now on just Kadcyla, and also wonder what my next cocktail might be if and when it quits working for me. I don't think I would ever go back on Taxotere again, but I've wondered about Taxol because some have said it's easier to tolerate than Taxotere when given weekly. Or maybe Abraxane might be an option. Unfortunately I can't take Xeloda, because I am one of the small % of the population lacking the enzyme to metabolize it, and it almost killed me in 2003. So, I'm already thinking ahead about possibly Tykerb, or... Who knows what! We just have to keep hanging in there until the next greatest thing comes along, and I do know Genentech has more stuff in the pipeline!",

Tumor is barely visible now. Next scan is end of June, and will update. So far the side effects are still not too bad. Mostly lots of fatigue for about 3 days, then I start to bounce back. I've had terrible neuropathy ever since my two go rounds with taxotere in 2001 and 2012, so am hoping that it does not progress on Kadcyla. I am such a klutz now, always dropping things and tripping if I'm not super careful! Denny, I read in one of your posts that your were on Kadcyla for 9 months, then in remission for awhile, then back on Kadcyla. Were you on any treatment during the time you were in remission? I was hoping that if my next scan shows no evidence of disease, that I might go back to just Herceptin, but my oncologist says no because I had progression while on it, and that it is no longer working. I don't know if I agree with that. The reason I'm questioning it is that I noticed in my records that my weight had dropped back in July of 2015, after a bad cold, and my dose of Herceptin was reduced. I continued to get the reduced dosage for the next 5-6 months, even though my weight came right back up, and even surpassed my original weight. Just wondering if not receiving the optimum dose of Herceptin could have lead to recurrence. This is something that I keep dwelling on, and I shouldn't, but I have Kaiser insurance, and they are all about cutting costs! ",

My first post didn't show up, and I'm still trying to figure out adding my diagnosis and treatments, so forgive if things are jumbled. I'm very interested in this thread as I'm fairly new to Kadcyla. I'm having my 4th infusion this Fri. and I sure hope it's working. This has been the easiest of any chemo I've had so far...knock wood. Having PET the end of this month to see if newest recurrence to peri-rectal area is shrinking.",

I've not yet had bloody nose issues, and really hope I can dodge that bullet. I would be in such trouble, as I catch every cold my grand kids get, caring for them several days a week. Right now I'm fighting another cold, and blowing my nose constantly! I'm also blessed with chronic teary eyes and runny nose, from my Taxotere days, even when I'm not sick. And Miriam, so glad to hear the Kadcyla is working well for you too! I will be 15 years stage IV in June, and this is definitely one of the easier treatments I've been on, although not as easy as the good old Herceptin was for so many years. I'm incredibly grateful for the years that I've been given though, and treat each and every day as a gift, not to be wasted. ",

It seems like these newer Her2 targeted drugs don't have the staying power that we were hoping for, but they are all we've got for now, so we've got to hang in til the next drug in the pipeline becomes available. It's no fun being on this slippery slope, not to mention all the great SE's! Sounds like you, Miriam and I should have bought stock in Kleenex! And Miriam, I too am taking the gabapentin (at bed time, because of drowsiness) for neuropathy, along with L- glutamine and Alpha Lipoic Acid. Can't say that I am able to tell if they are working. I just started taking some B12 yesterday, but am having second thoughts, as I just read that taking too much can cause cancer growth. Yikes!",

I didn't have any symptoms, but had read that the brain was a likely place for mets, so asked my doc to order an MRI for me. Good thing too, cause we found it early when it was only 8mm. By the time I was referred to UCSF and approved for the Gamma Knife, exactly one month had passed, and the tumor was 11mm when they zapped it. I have been having MRI's of my brain every 6 months ever since. My latest recurrence is no longer ER+, so we stopped the Femara when I started the Kadcyla. I was on the Femara (letrozole) since 2002, so was not sad to stop! I'm sure it is what caused my osteopenia. Very exciting about the Abemaciclib though, cause the ER status of any future mets could certainly change!",
