I guess anytime there is some type of abnormality its classified as a four. Please correct me if I am wrong. I am new to this and right now   I have read so much information that a lot of it does not even make sense anymore (i'm sure i'm just overwhelmed). Thanks for forwarding the radiology assistant website.  I really appreciate it.",

I will see the surgeon this friday for my test results but, my anxiety level is increasing with each passing day. Any information that  you can provide is greatly appreciated.I am so grateful to have found this board.  Log in to post a reply",
