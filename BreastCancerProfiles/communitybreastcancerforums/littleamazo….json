Last fall I had my regular mammo and for the first time was shown to the screening side of the radiation dept, where you don't have an exit interview with a radiologist.  I felt so gipped!  And of course, they called me couple days later and said they saw microcalcifications, to come back for more mammos (and exit interview!), that led to a stereotactic biopsy, and suggestion for a surgical biopsy for possible lob hyperplasia, but said it was not a rush.  That's when I jumped at the chance to have the prophylactic on the other side that I'd wished I had 10 yrs before. When I was googling my rad oncologist, to confirm his contact info, I found an article he wrote about it, kind of cautionary.  That's when I learned what it was called.  www.cinj.org/documents/ContraLateralProphylacticMastectomy_000pdf      I was still going to do it anyway, just to be done with it all, mammos, biopsies, concealing clothing.  This doc supported me 100%.  He and my surgeon both say it's only 0-2% on the other side, but again did not question me one bit.  First time in my life I've sort of looked forward to surgery.  Was approved by health insurance (needing the biopsy at the time probably helpted.)  I don't regret the decision at all, although I feel slightly sheepish, not wanting to complain about aches and pains because I asked for this (first discussion board I found here last week was on the sensitive skin and phantom pain stuff), it's mostly like a sunburn I guess.  It's a minor inconvenience and short-term as my skin recovers and then after that getting dressed will be easy and did I mention the no more mammos and biopsies?  I'm happy.  And the lab report was totally clean, nothing.  So I'm a lucky woman.   Blessings all",
