I am experiencing swelling on my upper arm specifically the tricep/bottom portion. It feels almost numb or strange sensations when I touch it. I have been stretching and have really good range of motion for only 1 week post surgery. Should I be worried about lymphedema so soon or let things settle down first. I think the drain is not draining exactly right considering it leaks on under my arm a bit and the pain in my tricep seems to be more pronounced since the leaking increased. My doctor says the leaking is normal and its not swollen but I clearly know it is as- well as my torso on the side of the surgery. Paranoid and confused...Â ",
