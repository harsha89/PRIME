    "Content": "lotsofquestions wrote: The dr's office called, and my Halo test came back normal. Yay! The dr will discuss my results with me on Monday, but my question is, am I in the clear?!? I had atypical cells found in breast fluid previously from a smear and they found an enlarged duct on ultrasound. The fluid that came out during the Halo test was bloody. Should this be the end of testing or should I be content with these results? Like I said, he'll discuss the results on Monday and he might suggest more testing, I'm just trying to figure out what questions I should ask or whether I should request further testing.
