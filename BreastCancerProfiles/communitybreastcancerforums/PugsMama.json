FightingGMA & Fightingirl: I'm in the waiting room too. I have the oncologist appt next Wed. I'm going to be so annoyed if my MammaPrint results aren't back by then. I've already cancelled a trip to FL but NO WAY am I missing my cruise at the end of May...so there! Worked a half-day yesterday...utterly exhausting but it was great seeing my friends & getting out of the house.. Seeing the PS today, he's always so positive it's always a good visit for me. Of course we won't be able to make any plans because we don't know if I'll need chemo yet...maybe he'll tell me I don't have to keep wearing a bra 24/7..something to hope for! LOL I'll be at the cabana with drinks waiting for those going today! You've got this!! ",

I've been told 5-10 years also...I'll be on arimidex probably since I don't have my ovaries. Thx for your support! Love your attitude & spirit!! Cowboy-up: your news sounds really positive! Vicwytch..loved reading about your great news! Wgraf: I'm brca2 also & had a total hysterectomy with ovaries out a while ago. Also took HRT & here I am today although my BS assures me that the HRT didn't cause the BC. Water under the bridge now...You're going through a lot, that's for sure, but you sound like a fighter & we're here to support you. How are you doing on Arimidex? I'm sure I'll be taking it too.... 3bears: I'm angry at what your \"friend\" said too! I find it very annoying when you share something & it becomes all about them...what they think, what they would or wouldn't do. Makes me want to say, \"I'm sorry, I just need your support, not your unsolicited opinion, this is about me, not you, thank you very much!\" Lol Fightingirl: hopefully your cording will get better after only a few treatments. we both have MOs appts next Wed...I'll be thinking of you! Are you starting rads next week too? Dani: hope you get good news at your MO appt on Monday. Pyrrh: you're so right! There are so many factors involved in a chemo recommendation. I used to think if you had clear nodes, it would be smooth sailing! Those were the days lol. Hoping your subsequent tests confirm you won't need chemo... Happy Friday everyone! Worked yesterday - chillin' out today!",

Couple of points about the ovary removal: it put me into instant menopause- was quite a shock to my system & I had to take HRT. Because I had the uterus taken out at the same time, I didn't have to worry about the SE of uterine cancer. I had them removed with the davinci robot method...couple of holes on the sides..not invasive at all. Easy recovery. Not sure if your risk of ovarian cancer goes up if you've already been had BC. As I mentioned, I removed mine bc of being BRCA+ & there's virtually no screening for ovarian cancer...Do these stressful decisions ever end? Re: the hormone treatment- I'll give it a try....if it's unbearable & ruining my QOL, I'll stop, but at least I will have gotten a little protection. I'm on the chemo board, there are a few gals over there with recurrences. It's not good. That definitely means BMX & chemo for you lucky lumpectomies! Because I love you all, I want you to give yourselves the best shot of beating this for good! I get nervous when I hear you thinking about not taking theTamoxifen.

Hopefully your DVT issue is gone by then. Happy New Year! ha, is right! It's starting to sink in for what a long journey this is going to be for all of us. Full of ups & downs along the way. 3bears is right....there is strength in numbers and we're all here to get each other through it! Vargadoll. Sorry you find yourself here. Fightingirl is right, you'll find a lot of support here and you'll know that everyone knows exactly how you feel. This experience is such a roller coaster of emotions but we've all had all of them! Believe it or not, you won't feel fear 24/7 but right now I know it might be hard for you to believe. 3bears: I met with my PS yesterday and he said I don't have to worry about size of the implants or what type for a while. I guess at some point I have to decide how big I want to be so he stops expanding them, but it's nothing I have to worry about right now. He said the size of the expanders, width-wise, has to do with the size of my chest wall, right now it's about fitting them to my body, not anything to do with eventual cup size. So I just put it out of my mind for now....I have a feeling your PS will tell you the same thing. I have so much to do before Wednesday my head is exploding! I have to work Sunday & Monday. I'm not working on Tuesday (surgery is Wed.) My hairdresser is fitting me in on Tuesday morning (God bless her!), will try to get a pedi afterwards (my feet are a mess!) & then back to the hospital's nuclear medicine dept. so they can inject me with the dye for the sentinel node biopsy. Oh joy! I do all the administrative crap in our household also, my 92 year old father-in-law lives with us. I have to make sure his \"pills\" are done for a couple of weeks etc. etc. etc. Of course this won't happen, but I feel like I have to prepare everything at home for if I die in the OR. Crazy, I know....why am I putting this extra pressure on myself? Having surgery will actually give me a well-deserved rest! Ha Ha! ",

      "Content": "Jan 1, 2017 04:08PM PugsMama wrote: OMG, DsMom, what a nightmare you're going through! Here in the U.S., I think reconstruction is always discussed up front because it's federal law that insurance has to pay for reconstruction for a lumpectomy (if you need it) or mastectomies if you have breast cancer. There are positives about waiting for the recon though and I considered waiting myself if only to buy myself more time before making a decision. The recon decision was torture for me, much harder than the mastectomy decision. The pros on waiting is that you heal much faster from the mastectomies & it's easier to shop around for the PS, you're not tied into the one that works with your breast surgeon. Of course the negative is that you're looking at another surgery down the road....but instead of one invasive surgery, you have two not so bad ones. I also have two lumps in the same breast. The small one was biopsied during the MRI which came back as cancerous. The 2nd was previously biopsied during a sonogram and was negative then but it's changing shape & growing & bc of the scar tissue, to have it biopsied would require more of a lumpectomy. They didn't bother because I'm opting for bilateral mastectomies due to my genetic mutation & strong family history. If I were low risk, I would be a candidate for a lumpectomy also, although I'm not sure I would have chosen that anyway but It's hard to me to look at this through the lens of not being at high risk for cancer. It will be very easy for you to find out the pros & cons of lumpectomy vs. mastectomy, the hard part will be deciding which way you should go...While I didn't choose lumpectomy, I personally know a couple of older women who had lumpectomies at least 10-20 years ago & they're doing fine! Anyway, I won't be seeing an oncologist until post-surgery either since I won't get a pathology report until the breasts are removed. I don't think it's that unusual unless you need treatment before surgery. I know I'm not the only one in this group having surgery this month that doesn't yet have a treatment plan. Vargadoll, as far as telling other people, everyone in my life knows. I'm a pretty open person & a several of my friends have already had cancer of one sort or another. My personal philosophy is I'll take all the prayers I can get! I did ask them not to treat me any differently & to feel comfortable asking me anything. What makes me uncomfortable is that I feel really self-absorbed with all this cancer sh*t right now, but I guess that comes with the territory. Like Fightingirl (& probably many of you here), I'm very independent & self-sufficient so It's hard for me to ask for or accept help, but I try to remember how good it feels when I'm there for the people in my life and they'll feel just as good being there for me. I'm blessed with a lot of love & support, and I wouldn't have that if I kept it to myself. On the other hand, one of my dear friends has sarcoma & she's told hardly anyone & I think she told me only because she knows that I have cancer. You have to do what fits with your nature, if you're a very private person, being quiet about it may make sense to you. My only advice would be that if you're quiet about it out of fear of how people will react, I would give that a second thought. This process has fear associated with every aspect of dealing with it and you may be surprised at how good other people's support feels. The hardest person to tell was my mom, because I knew she would blame herself bc I inherited her \"rotten genes,\" as she calls them. She had bilateral breast cancer at age 58, one year older than I am now, & we both share the same BRACA2 mutation. I waited until there was a plan in place before telling her so she wouldn't have to worry over unknowns. Then I gave her some research to do re: various reconstruction options & kept reassuring her that it was caught early & my prognosis is good. It might have been a little easier to tell her because she's been through it, I don't know. I'm not a mom but I can't imagine it's easy for any parent to hear that their child has cancer, no matter how old they are but if you are a parent yourself, I imagine you know how resilient parents can be when the going gets tough & your kids need you.

Finding out you have cancer is a jolt no matter what your mental state so please let your doctor know you need extra help right now so you don't slide back into suicidal thoughts.

I had steristrips on my boobs after my biopsies which was right before Thanksgiving & my boobs were still red when they took them off! You wouldn't believe the getup my sides are in...no steristrips but they've got clear tape over my drain tubes & on top of that, a thin layer of foam glued on top of it & I have to wear this constricting surgical bra on top of that! I think I'm stuck with this (no pun intended!) until I see the PS on Tuesday...I'm going to ask him to remove everything & come up with something else. After all it'll be two weeks post-op by then... Elem: hope your bronchitis is getting better... Goingon75: you sound very serene. Please share your calming perspective often! 3bears: hubby & I rarely watch tv together...our tastes are too different. It's not like we talk to each other when the TV in on anyway! I think it's also a way for each of us to have our own space...I'm actually a football fan & he doesn't watch sports...lol. Congratulations on the poop & happy birthday! PSA: For those of you on brain meds who may end up taking tamoxifen, certain SSRIs (e.g. Zoloft, Paxil) hinder tamoxifen's effectiveness...if you have to switch to Effexor, the good news is it doesn't put on weight & it helps with hot flashes (I've been on it since my ovaries came out) see below: http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/a...",

I can't lose so many friends at once! I went to the BS & the MammaPrint results weren't in yet...it's oncologist time, made a couple of appts with a couple of places, first one is next Wed. Hopefully the Mammaprint is back by then. The BS gave me a pep talk about chemo, though. Said I have one shot to knock this out of me forever & if it were her, she'd have chemo. She said if the cancer comes back (I guess as mets), it's no longer curable. She must have seen the horrified expression on my face because she then said, \"look, you're young & healthy & you'll get through it. It begins & ends & you'll stay cancer-free. You're cancer-free now, you want to stay that way.\" I don't think she was saying chemo is a definite, but she was preparing me for what sounded like a better than 50/50 shot it will be recommended...ugh. Said hormonal treatment would be a definite (no surprise there...) Tough love lol. I don't need to see her for three months, the MO takes over now...",

We had a couple of couples over, one of the gals is a 10 year BC survivor. This is in no way normal, but we compared BC scars & reconstruction. It was encouraging to see how much her scars had faded over 10 years...very very faint at this point. Lots of laughs & an overall good time. It was refreshing to get out of my own head for a while! going to go to work for a few hours tomorrow afternoon so we'll see how that goes. I also showed hubby the foobs for the first time yesterday, believe it or not. I guess I was feeling courageous after showing my girlfriend. My reluctance to do so before then was my issue, like 3 bears has said, I think, feeling like I was a misfit toy or something. I certainly wasn't worried about his reaction or anything, I know he loves me but maybe it was just another step I had to take to make it more real. He was wonderful & so supportive, and I'm relieved now that that's over with. A-Boob: You must be relieved now that your parents know. Save me a margarita! Now I don't care who sees my foobs either. Better get a grip on that before I go to work tomorrow afternoon LOL! ",

My MammaPrint came back with my tumor as Luminal B (instead of Luminal A), which is more aggressive, that combined with it being 2.2cm, with lympatic vascular invasion led to the \"she would benefit from chemo\" recommendation. How much benefit? 5-7% but like many of you, if God forbid I have a recurrence, my only consolation will be that I did everything I could on my end. After that, it's God's plan, right? The MammaPrint is different from the Oncotype in that it just gives a category of tumor with a chemo / no chemo recommendation. Mine of course recommended chemo. No point in getting a second opinion because no oncologist is going to recommend against the results of a MammaPrint. So, I'm going to be starting next Wednesday & the good news is I'll still be able to go on my cruise at the end of May...I go 4 times every three week so in 9 weeks from Feb. 15 I'll be done. That gives me a little over a month before I sail....Holding onto that!!! So my cancer brain is going to become chemo brain! OMG, I don't think there's too much room for me to get more spaced out than I am LOLOL! So just wanted to get this news out there since I know you were all pulling for me. Thanks, love you all!

Can't wait to hear about your new permanent foobs! Next for me: CRUISE to Bermuda at the end of May. No hair, still have TEs, but I don't care!! When I get back from that, I have to talk to the MO about hormonal treatment. I think I'd rather be on Tamoxifen than Arimidex, the AIs scare the heck out of me. I just think there's something scary & dangerous about removing all estrogen from your body. At least with tamoxifen, your body gets the benefit of estrogen (strong bones etc.) without feeding the ER+ cancer cells. If it's a little less effective for post-menopausal women, I'm ok with that. Back burner for now, thank goodness I would imagine sometime over the summer I'll have my exchange surgery. Thanks A-Boob, but if I need fat grafting, I've got plenty of my own to contribute LOL!

Thanks for starting this group! Leftcoastie, if you don't mind me asking, is your PS hesitant bc you're large breasted? It's a paradigm shift for me bc I never thought it was safe to keep them (my mom had a BMX 24 years ago & that was the conventional wisdom then so that was my frame of reference...) now it seems that if the tumor is far enough away, it's safe to keep them. Have you had your final BS & PS appts before your surgery yet?",

I want to repeat what I wrote yesterday, when you wake up from the surgery, all the anxiety & stress will be lifted. You will feel RELIEF to be getting the cancer out of your body and you will look at the surgery as life-giving. I even had the courage to take a peek at my new teenage bumps under the surgical bra & they didn't look too bad (too bad the rest of me doesn't look like a teenager LOL!). Don't expect to get any sleep in the hospital & bring ear plugs. All night, they're either coming in to take your BP, or emptying your drains, or you have to go to the bathroom,& those leg compressors are non-stop. I swear mine had a little horn that blew every time they inflated! I slept 12 hours last night after I got home I was so exhausted. My pain is non-existent except for this surgical bra. I can tell that is going to become pretty annoying. It's so tight, but my PS said I could loosen it now & then for a little relief. So this is all I have to do for the next couple of weeks: empty my four drains once a day & that's it! No wound maintenance, nothing to do with the dressings, leave the surgical bra alone. Bummer is I can't shower for two weeks, yuck, I can handle the sponge baths but DH is going to have to wash the hair at some point! also, I can't lift my arms straight up over my head for a couple of weeks. No exercise. A prescription for laziness yay! So this morning I got up and emptied my drains without fainting! Victory! For laying around in bed, I made my own hospital gown of sorts, took one of my DH's enormous tee shirts and cut it straight up the middle of the back just to the neckline (left that intact). Easy to get on & off and having the back open is more comfortable for me. They pinned the drains to the surgical bra (I have two on each side) but these tubes are hanging all over the place...I feel like one of the ghosts who come to visit Scrooge in \"A Christmas Carol.\" LOL I'm in absolutely no pain if you can believe that! It may be because my TEs were inserted above my pectoral muscle instead of underneath it.. Doing OK with just Tylenol now and then. I also had an \"anesthesia headache\", it's finally starting to lift. The headache could have also been from the pain killer drip. Has everyone checked in? Win-chimed might just be getting home today & I don't expect to hear from Maya because she had a DIEP & is probably still in ICU. Hopefully they're doing OK. To everyone in the queue, you're going to do great! We've got this!!! Looking forward to hearing everyone check in. Am praying for all of you!!! Back to my beach chair with my umbrella drink...... xoxo Liz ",

Vargadoll: You have certainly been through a lot & you're right, now cancer too! WTF! They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and I certainly admire your strength! You give so much support to all of us & I'm so glad you're here! 3Bears: I can certainly empathize with how you're feeling right now. The night before my surgery, I actually took pictures of my boobs. At that point in time, all I could think of was the loss of my breasts and couldn't feel what I was gaining. The day of my surgery, like Fightingirl said, I was at peace and focused solely on getting the cancer out of my body. I wasn't anxious or stressed and just remembered all of you supporting me and holding my hands and that's what we'll be doing for you tomorrow. Trust that the anxiety will be lifted, only one more day. As I've said before, the surgery is life-giving and a big step toward regaining your health and you'll be feeling all of this tomorrow. I didn't have any lorazepam but I took a couple of tylenol PM the night before & that helped me sleep. the PM in Tylenol PM is only benadryl, an allergy medicine that causes drowsiness. I've been taking a couple every night and it really helps me fall asleep. Fightingirl: so glad you messaged win-chimed, I don't think Marimucho has checked in yet either. she's one of the sexy sixers! Has anyone heard from her? GT1965: I'm an info hound too! When my PS came to see me the next day in the hospital, I had a list of questions written down and he joked with the nurse, saying about me, \"she's my information chick.\" Knowledge is power my friend and no one will advocate for you like yourself! Welcome! docmama: First of all, congratulations on the clear nodes! That's fantastic news that so many of us on here have been able to share over the past week. I'm going to tell my doctors about the thoracic epidural the next time I see them. What a wonderful option for so many of us that have a hard time handling the narcotics. Many choose pain rather than the horrible side effects! Elem: You are always offering encouragement & support to everyone here but you haven't mentioned how your recovery is going..... Smooth sailing, I hope! DCISinAZ: Welcome. There's a very very good chance if the MRI showed your nodes clear that they are. I know none of us will be reassured until we get our pathology reports but MRIs more often show false positives rather than false negatives. Maya15: Congratulations to moving to OTC pain meds. I felt great when the narcotic brain fog started to lift! I think they gave me a dull headache too. I know you have your appt. tomorrow. Hope you're happy with your results. I can't wait until my foobs don't look like Frankenfoobs! Amul17: Welcome. Glad you're here & we'll be here to support you! jinmo: making the appt. makes it real...You won't be alone to go through this. We'll all be with you! Mama2BC: Glad you're here. I'm starting to realize that our fears and anxieties not only affect us, but they affect all of our relationships. I feel so self-absorbed right now and not really \"present\" with other people. I hate that & hoping that I get some balance with this over time. There is no doubt that we all know how you feel and you can bring everything here. Lord knows, I do! The only question I can answer is that you don't have to bring any special clothes to the hospital when you have your surgery but like Goincrzy8 said, when you have your pre-surgery appointment with your PS, they'll confirm that for you. They sent me home in a \"surgical bra\" (which I hate) & I have to just leave it on until my follow-up visit. Bring a large button down shirt to go home in....thats all. I didn't have a caregiver & I was lucky enough to be able to go home the next day. I can only share my experience but I didn't regret not having one. There's not much \"body maintenance\" that I needed. They would come in and empty my drains, check my BP & accompany me to the bathroom, between that & the leg compressors, you'll be lucky to get any sleep! Bring earplugs & lozenges to the hospital. Leftcoastie: sorry you ripped a stitch...I think that's how I got blood on my surgical bra, unconsciously trying to roll over in bed. I've since pinned them to the front of my bra instead of having them hang off the sides. UGH. Hope you're not too sore... ******** On a personal note, I'm off to the BS on Wednesday for my follow-up visit & to get my pathology report & I assume start working on a treatment plan. I'm not ready for this next phase but what else is new? I haven't been ready for any of this LOL! My latest anxiety is about treatment, but I'm sure I'll move on to mets in no time! Convinced my husband to go skiing today! He's retired & has a season pass to a local ski area & was reluctant to go because he thinks he has to take care of me 24/7. I appreciate his dedication to taking care of me but quite frankly, I think the break will be good for both of us! Thank for the poop prayers...they worked! Yay! And..Leftcoastie...you inspired me! I washed my hair this morning - feel like a new woman! Prayers for all going this week & all recovering from last week! xoxo Liz ",

Some of us who didn't have treatment before surgery are anxiously awaiting if that's going to be part of out treatment plan...good luck with the nipple decision. My reconstruction decisions drove me nuts! My personal nipple decision was they both stay or they both go...ended up not being able to keep 'em anyway so that was that... The apprehension is the worst part! Many of us (myself included) felt a tremendous sense of relief when it was over. You just close your eyes, wake up & are so happy to get that cancer out of your body! I had my ovaries out a while ago. Make sure they use the da Vinci robot method when you are ready for that surgery. Couple of teeny holes & you'll be up & about in no time... ",

I had a little bit of air pumped in during the surgery & today he filled both sides to 400cc. So technically my second fill including the day of surgery. No pain at all...Probably a \"B cup\" right now if I had to guess. He said I might not even get filled more than that which would be ok with me. Even with the scars, the foobs are starting to look pretty good! I'm seeing my BS next wed., if the MammaPrint results are back, I guess we'll have \"that dreaded conversation\" re: chemo & start meeting with an oncologist. Thanks Iraystar for your reassurance....I watched both of my parents go thru it....have to trust that it's not that bad anymore & they've made progress with that along with everything else... I see the PS again next Tues, we'll see if I can start exercising then. He never mentioned anything about PT & he's pretty good about telling me everything coming up.... my range of motion is fine so I don't expect to need it. Like DCISinAZ, I'm taking my no exercise prescription very seriously! Exercise does increase drain output. He doesn't want a whole lot of movement of / strain on my upper arms so the acellular dermal matrix \"sets\" & integrates with my skin & tissue flaps. So far so good!",

Since that put me into \"surgical menopause\", I know I won't be taking Tamoxifen, but there are other hormonal treatments for post-menopausal women. One type keeps the estrogen produced by your body (after menopause, your adrenal glands & fat cells produce estrogen) from feeding the cancer cells & they essentially starve to death. Wouldn't it be great if liposuction were an effective treatment to reduce the amount of fat cells producing estrogen? I'd volunteer for that clinical trial lol! My laziness prescription has expired, PS said I can start walking, I'm feeling so out of shape too! I'm not very athletic, needless to say... But, since you had DCIS & not IDC, maybe losing the ovaries would be enough \"estrogen reduction\". Worth asking about since most women hit menopause in their 50s anyway (I think....one of the things that bugs me about the hormonal treatments is they go on for at least 5 years... Dyell32: we're all here to support you... To all the newbies, welcome...it may be helpful as you ask questions or share your experiences if you made your diagnosis & surgery & treatment \"public.\" The default is \"private\", you can change that in your settings...then those in the same boat, so to speak, can respond...

They give you a toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash etc. but it doesn't hurt to have a small toiletry bag & an extra pair of undies. Hairbrush, Lozenges, earplugs & Chapstick or some kind of lip balm is all you'll need. I also took what meds I take (just in case) even though they ended up giving them to me anyway. Don't wear contact lenses or any jewelry.

They're Natrelle Inspira cohesive (round smooth silicone). Left side is 615cc, right is 650cc. My right side was always smaller so the size differential is to even me out. The scabs & bruising on top are from the fat grafting. You probably remember, I had pre-pectoral TEs & of course these are too. Recovery was a piece of cake, no pain whatsoever. Can start exercising on Aug. 24, the recovery time is more bc of the bruising from where he took the fat. I love them! They feel like young boobs LOL! It's been a long 8 months!

Glad to hear you're starting to feel better. My last bm was wed am before the surgery, not uncomfortable either so it just crossed my mind today that it's been a while. (I'm so used to focusing on whether or not the dogs have pooped, I never think about my own schedule. Maybe I should go for a walk...that always gets the dogs going haha!). Only started eating real food yesterday though (before that lots of liquids...soup, juice etc)..& I have been taking a stool softener twice a day. Note to self: eat some more fiber today! Add me to the poop prayer chain! Vargadoll: I had 2 MRI stereotactic biopsies right after Thanksgiving & plenty before that over the years. My left boob had 4 clips & the right one had 2 (I'm getting used to talking about them in the past tense). Anyway, that's how they found my cancer. I had terrible bruising from that even up to the surgery date which was over a month later, but the incisions healed pretty quickly. The glue on the steri-strips really irritated my skin. I have clear tape on my training bra foobs & so far so good, irritation-wise. The inside of my upper right arm & armpit where they took the axillary node is totally numb when I touch it. I know that's pretty common but it weirded me out a little bit bc you have no sense of how hard you're pressing on the skin with a washcloth. Freak out moment alert! There's some dried blood on my surgical bra so I had to undo it to see if one of the wound sites was leaking. Good news is no so maybe one of my drains leaked. Everything seems ok & secure now so who knows. So I saw my foobs in their entirety. I'm not going to sugar coat it, it's a major shock but I have to remember they have a lot of healing to do. I really wasn't ready but seeing the dried blood forced the situation on me. Thank God I looked at post MX pictures online ahead of time to try to prepare myself. Maybe it worked bc I managed to hold it together & not faint! Decided not to have a pity party but it wasn't easy! You're my FB too! Xoxo",

The surprises are that my tumor is almost 3 times larger than we thought (.8 cm vs. 2.2 cm) and some of the path scores indicate it is moderately aggressive (e.g. 20% Ki-67, lymphatic invasion). Under traditional criteria, if my tumor were 2 cm, I'd be Stage 1A & no chemo. But what to do since it's only 2mm larger, which technically makes me Stage 2A? Traditionally, those with Stage 2A get chemo. Gratefully, my BS is in no hurry to treat me as if I'm really Stage 2A just because of 2mm (she said I'm \"just over the border\") so she ordered a MammaPrint of the tumor. From what I understand about the MammaPrint, it's a genomic test which gives a better idea whether or not chemo will be of any benefit in early stage cancer patients. So my dream of \"gee whiz Liz, we're sorry, you didn't have IDC, you had DCIS - enjoy your reconstruction & have a nice life!\" is over!! LOL As one of you said recently, \"this sh*t's getting real!\" Going to the bungalow for a pina colada RIGHT NOW!!! xoxo",

Wish I still had my ponchos from the 70's, they'd come in handy now! Have you tried the prostheses yet? it may make you feel better while you're waiting for recon. I feel like I have frankenfoobs right now & I'm pretty self-conscious about them...but this too shall pass. What I really don't like right now is that with these drain pods, they make me look like my stomach is way larger than my chest! Of course it doesn't help that I have them pinned in the front like a total nut! Maybe I should just say I'm pregnant lol! What did they say in the movie, \"Moonstruck\"? \"Everything is temporary!\" P.S. Edit:Just saw that you tried them. Glad you're feeling better! This cancer business sure ain't for sissies! Thank you all for being here...I can't even imagine going through all this without all of you! How blessed we are to have each other. I am so attached to all of you & you give me so much strength.

I couldn't think of a reason why I would need one since the only \"mastectomy maintenance\" I have is emptying the drains which amazingly enough, I have no problem doing...if I had to do some kind of wound care or change dressings, I would've said yes.

Chemo is given for a lot of reasons & often it's to kill any cancer cells which may have been left behind after surgery even if you have received a good pathology report. Chemo after surgery is all about improving your chances that the cancer won't come back.This site has some good educational articles which explains this much better than I can! http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy Your oncologist should be willing to answer all your questions. Most of us don't think of the questions we wish we asked until we get home. Feel free to call the office & ask to speak with your doctor because you have concerns... ",

Hoping you find out it was just DCIS, but like you said, if it's IDC, so what, you've already gotten rid of it! If you can avoid treatment, that's a major plus as far as I'm concerned! I read somewhere that a lot of women don't stick with the hormonal therapy for five years bc of side effects (not that everyone gets them of course) but five years is a long time to alter your hormonal makeup. I bet your family has some kind of genetic marker they haven't discovered yet. The fact your sister has already had BC tells me that there's a lot more out there that needs to be discovered. I watched the Tig Notaro special on Netflix yesterday. I guess you would call it a documentary. For those choosing to go \"flat & fabulous\" she is an inspiration! I highly recommend it. She brings humor to this crazy world of BC & I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's funny, one of my dear friends who's as flat-chested as can be said, \"I'd never do reconstruction, no one would know the difference!\" LOL A-Boob: I have a fenced in yard - so no walking the dogs! I do keep a pillow on my chest at all times when I'm sitting or laying down in case my fur-babies decide to jump on \"the mommy!\"",

That would explain why they took so many...measure the circumference of your upper arm daily & if it even gets a just little bigger, call your BS. Most recon, whether above or underneath the pectoral, uses alloderm or something similar. That has to integrate with your own tissue & get circulation from your tissues to work properly & support the TE / implant...sometimes if your circulation isn't strong enough, you have to heal for a while first... I can appreciate your frustration though...I'm sure they just want your recon to be a success...doesn't make the waiting any easier, tho. Do you have a treatment plan? Will you need any?",

Hope your pathology report keeps you off the chemo train! Your surgical bra will also help even the boobs out. You can work with the Velcro shoulder straps to pull the left one up a little more until the right one settles down maybe? Did-not-see: so sorry your armpit is giving you so much trouble. Is it cording? Fightingirl: yesterday must have been exhausting but you're done with rads now, right? Whoo hoo! Rest up & when you're up to it, let us know how you're feeling...xoxo Will post a chemo update later but finally had a decent night's sleepthanks to Tylenol pm & Ativan! Love you all 😘.",

They are looking at this through different lenses but what's healthiest for you has to trump all other considerations. For what it's worth, my PS recommended either keeping both or removing both for the best cosmetic outcome if that's any help. Personally, I'm going to opt for uniformity. If the cancer side goes, the other side is going too...I know how you feel though, these reconstruction decisions have been such a struggle for me too! Let us know what you decide... Leftcoastie, I also feel really comfortable with my BS & PS. Something positive to focus on! Another positive thought. I ate (& drank) too much this Christmas season (not a very healthy response to stress I admit!) & am hoping to drop some weight after the surgery. I'm meeting with my BS tomorrow after pre-op testing & with the PS on Friday.. Looking for a perky size C too! What are you bringing to the hospital? I looked at the list on this site & I can't imagine bringing all that with me! Now that it's just 8 days away, my adrenaline's in overdrive lol!",

Lesson for those to follow, do not assume your M.D.'s office will fax the medical clearance without you reminding them.That's all I'm going to say about that! It all worked out in the end. The gal who does my hair gave me one of those plastic capes they snap around your neck when they color your hair ...said it would be helpful in the shower with the drains. I thought that was really sweet. Treated myself to a \"spa pedi\" today. Forced me to drag out the weed whacker to shave my legs before I got there! This is funny, I went for the nuclear dye today because my sentinel node biopsy is so early tomorrow morning and the tech, a nice gal from the islands, told me my breasts already look as good as reconstructed breasts! I almost fell over...I think it was a compliment. Anyway that set the tone and we had a good time. I told her that other than my husband, she actually might be the last person to see my boobs and what an honor that was! The BEST news is that radiologist told me that even with the dye in me, I could (& should) drink some wine tonight. Well, that's all I needed to hear.... This is even funnier! My 91 year old father-in-law (who lives with us) quipped to me this morning: \"You know Liz, I was thinking...losing your breasts is an easy way to lose some weight.\" You have to know him to get how funny that was. It just seems that God is allowing humor to penetrate my fears & worries today and I'm so grateful for it! Had a crying jag before going to sleep last night (that's a tough time of the day for me), so it was such a gift to have a few laughs today! The only bummer is that my Costco did not have the flannel shirts! Of course I managed to spend a fortune there regardless... I see there are new people joining our group every day and I'm looking forward to getting to know each one of you better once I'm home recuperating. To the gals going this week, I want to say I'm with all of you & praying for you and holding all of your hands because by the time I'm back online, you will already have had your surgeries. I will certainly check in as soon as I'm back home...I'll miss you all for the next couple of days! And THANK YOU for all of your prayers & support & for holding my hand! Here we go! xoxoxo Liz  ",

Both of us were led to believe that out tumors were small, stage 1a & who thinks about chemo for such small early stage disease, especially HER-? No radiation, the boobs are gone, great! Sure, hormonal treatment of some sort but chemo? Now we get our path reports, tumors way bigger than expected and all of a sudden chemo is part of the conversation...it's a shock It's great your doctor, like mine, is ordering a genetic test of the tumor. Let's not give up hope that we won't need chemo, but if we do, at least we'll know we're having it to reduce our risk of recurrence based on the genetic make-up of our cancer. To say I know how you feel is an understatement. When I got my report I broke down bc it really hit me that I have cancer & the whole treatment thing is ahead of me & it's not just about my recon. Whatever it turns out to be, we'll get through it together! Xoxo Liz.",

I didn't have nipple sparing and when I say I've got scars, I'm not kidding...but, the shape is OK and if you just look at implant reconstruction as internal prostheses, basically saving you the hassle of having to use external ones, you'll be OK with it. Many of us had a farewell for our boobs, took pictures- including me, but once they were gone, I was so happy to get that cancer out of my body and it was a tremendous relief. All of the pre-surgery anxiety had been lifted and even though I'm in the process of getting \"internal prostheses\", at the end of it, I think they'll be OK....good enough, and probably better than good enough. What I'm pleasantly surprised over is how quickly I'm adjusting to this \"new normal\" which is my body, scars and all. And you will too....

Better day today, went to chemo orientation, got a really nice goodie bag that volunteers put together. A nice pink soft throw, lip balm, that kind of stuff. Really thoughtful, I was very touched that they do that for the new patients. Didn't learn too much but that's bc I'm on the chemo board here & have chemo warriors & coaches paving the way!

I will be on an aromatase inhibitor because after menopause, instead of your ovaries producing estrogen, your adrenal gland produces aromatase, an enzyme which converts fat & other cells in your body to estrogen. AIs, therefore, \"inhibit\" the production of that enzyme leading to less estrogen in your body. I personally would opt for liposuction but no one else thinks that's a good idea!

      "Content": "Dec 27, 2016 07:41PM - edited Dec 27, 2016 08:54PM by PugsMama 3bears, I was initially planning on getting a DIEP and was pretty far along in the scheduling etc until I realized that my overwhelming anxiety were my fears about the reconstruction. I had to decide if the benefits outweighed the risks of such a long surgery & recuperative process for someone my age (57). After much soul searching, I decided to go with implants instead. This was my thought process on the matter... (1) I'm OK with having a foreign object in my body. (2) Having \"natural\" breasts that age with you & gain & lose weight with you was definitely a negative for someone my age! (3) They still have to do a second procedure a year down the road to tweak the results, maybe fat grafting or whatever so that's the same for either choice. (4) If in 10-12 years from now, they have to replace the implants, they'll have better technology. (5) I'm OK with \"fake\" perky breasts... (6) This is not a good time for me to be out of commission for so long. (7) At least from what the PS showed me, the pictures of the DIEP did not look any better than the implant pictures; (8) I can always go for the DIEP down the road if the implants don't work out for some reason... Once I landed on implants, I didn't look back because believe me, it was crazy enough coming to that decision!. That's my story. You may have different priorities or concerns. It helped me to try to articulate what I was fearful of and if it was \"legitimate\" or not. I agree that the indecision is torture. I had to change my PS once I decided because my initial PS was primarily a DIEP person. I love my new PS, who is the \"implant\" expert at my hospital. Good luck deciding, I swear this reconstruction business is harder than coming to grips with having cancer! If your fear about implants is that you won't like them, try to communicate to you PS what you're afraid you won't like, is it the look, the feel, the recovery, the tissue expander process, the risk of what can go wrong with them. Ask if you're a candidate for pre-pectoral (above the muscle) tissue expanders. If my \"flaps\" are thick enough, my PS will do that for me & that alleviates the pressure on the ribs that some complain about. I think it's up to the BS to decide how thick they can be. But if \"thicker\" flaps means more breast tissue left behind & that increases my recurrence risk, forget it, they can go under the muscle. The frustrating thing about all of this is that because I'm having a BMX, they won't know a lot until they go in there since we don't know for sure how far away the tumor is from the nipple (there was another suspicious something they didn't biopsy bc I'm having BMX) if there's any nodal involvement, etc. etc. So all my decisions are \"if we can\", or \"if all goes well once we're in there\" etc. etc. Wishing you peace with whatever you decide!

Well, I met with the BS today and she's not feeling too good about that. My breasts are apparently larger than I gave them credit for and the tumor is on the borderline of being too close to the nipple. So that decision is dealt with.She referred to the implants as \"internal prostheses\" which is a good reminder for me that they won't be \"breast replacements.\" I liked that. Thinking of them that way will help me keep my expectations realistic. She has a little bit of a brusque personality but I appreciate her no nonsense forthrightness. I'll see her a week after the surgery to go over the pathology report & treatment plan etc. Bummer, there's still that \"cancer\" thing to deal with....oh well, one step at a time. One more thing I wanted to share, my mom (BS survivor of 24 years...) recently got the \"teardrop\" implants as a replacement set- I saw them today for the first time & they looked pretty good, even on an 82 year old!",

I know we'll be here for each other through all the phases & to everyone having surgery this week, I'll be thinking of each and every one of you.

In 2008, my mom was found to be BRCA2 positive (she's a bilateral BC survivor diagnosed when she was 58, a year older than me at my dx). I was then tested and as it turns out we share the same mutation. At that time, Myriad, the genetic testing company, determined that our particular mutation was one of a handful deemed a \"variant of uncertain significance.\" Basically, they hadn't figured out whether it increased your risk of cancer or had no effect. When I found out were shared the same BRCA2 mutation, I had prophylactic bi-salpingo oophorectomies (& a hysterectomy bc of other problems) because my rationale at the time was let's deal with the ovaries first because there's no good screening for ovarian cancer. My insurance company paid for that. I chose to wait until I was healed from that to have my prophylactic mastectomies. You see, they said the variant was of \"uncertain significance\" but my great-grandmother had ovarian cancer, my grandmothers (on both sides) & my mom had BC so I always knew it was a matter of time for me. I healed from that surgery, and I moved on to schedule my prophylactic mastectomies & reconstruction. I remember that my surgery was scheduled for a Tuesday, I was emotionally & physically ready to go, and the Friday before I received a call from the BS advising me that Myriad had finally moved our mutation out of the \"undetermined\" category & had come to a determination that our mutation did NOT cause an increase in breast / ovarian cancer risk and therefore my insurance company would NOT pay for the prophylactic mastectomies. I was devastated but there was nothing I could do. The genetic counselor tried to explain their reasoning but I believed then (and still do) that they were wrong in their classification. So I went back on the high-risk screening bandwagon with the hope that whenever breast cancer caught up with me, it would be caught early. Fast forward seven years and here I am today, after plenty of scares & biopsies along the way. When my BS called Myriad & told them of my situation, they offered to \"re-screen\" me (for free, of course) for all the new gene mutation variants they've discovered since my initial screening. I haven't received the results yet\u2026stay tuned. ",

Hold onto the fact that if your MRI shows clean lymph nodes, there's a good chance that won't change. MRIs more often than not show false positives, not false negatives. I know this may sound strange but the worst anxiety is pre-surgery & many of us felt so relieved when it was over. It will turn out to be a positive that you don't have to wait a long time for your surgery. You're no longer alone...we're all here with you & for each other.

SheilaW8: I have a rash too, but I think it was where they put the betadine (that orange stuff). I have little bumps on my upper arms & across my midriff. The tape on my sides itches like crazy too! I take Tylenol pm at night & the pm not only helps me sleep, it gives me a break from feeling itchy. Leftcoastie, my Jan 4 sister: aren't we so done with these drains? I've got 4 of them. Hoping I can ditch at least 2 at my PS appt on Tues. Thanks for your encouraging words of support. Don't know what my treatment plan will be yet, but believe me, I will be here to soak up all the support I can get!

My neurons are not firing on all cylinders yet...OMG! Leftcoastie: Sunday was that kind of day for me.I never even got out of bed. Flatlined, I call it. Didn't take any calls because I didn't want to have to \"fake\" a positive attitude on the phone. So I went with it and felt a little better the next day. I think we all have to expect that it's not going to be smooth sailing for us mentally every day. The amount of stress associated with this diagnosis is beyond what my coping skills can keep up with sometimes! I read that article about PTSD too! Makes a lot of sense...maybe that's why I'm having such a hard time concentrating.. Annoyingboob: Thanks so much for the tip about the panty liners. I took my first shower today (whoo hoo!) and the PS said to put on some ointment he prescribed & band aids on top of the holes where the drains were until they close up. Well, you and I know how much band aids are a no no, so I found some panty liners in the closet & stuck them to the inside of my bra! Perfect! DCISinAZ: I have a lot of mobility. The most difficult thing at first was putting pressure on my arms to get myself up or on or off the bed (if that makes sense). The only restriction I had was not lifting anything heavy or lifting my arms straight up over my head. Other than that, it hasn't been a challenge for me at all. I was off pain meds by the time I got home the next day (I was only taking Tylenol) so I wasn't woozy or anything like that & totally able to walk around the house without any help.... Shellybeans: Am sending you a private message re: pre-pectoral implant research which you may wish to share with your PS. An encouraging thought: My mom was dx at 58 with BC, now she's 82 & never had a recurrence. She looks at that time as a blip in her life, & rarely, if ever, thinks about it and assures me it will be the same for me sooner rather than later....it's hard to believe I'll ever get to that mindset but time heals all wounds (pun intended!)

It seems to have been a daily occurrence for me over the past few days. I think as I get closer to my MammaPrint results day (presumably Wed), my coping skills are becoming woefully inadequate! I did share with hubby this morning that I'm not fearful of anything in particular, but that I think I'm grieving all the losses that come with cancer (boobs, health, sanity lol) & reacting to the trauma of all this, I guess in a way explaining that I have PTSD. I felt better after trying to put words to what's going on with me emotionally because i think he understood that this is a process that's going to take some time, that I have been through a big trauma (& still going thru it) which took some pressure off of me from what I've been telling myself, \"I should be ok by now...after all, my nodes are clear & any treatment is just going to be preventive.\" He assured me that he has no expectations of how I should be dealing with this which made me feel so much better. I had been thinking I'm so burnt out on all this BC BS, I can only imagine how he feels....our conversation helped me give myself permission to just go thru this without the pressure of \"being strong\" for his sake. Ironically, I felt so much stronger afterwards! I'm sore under my armpit where the axillary node was removed but I think it's because maybe some of the numbness is going away. It does seem to be getting more & sensitive on the side (next to the foob) also. I get the tingles down my arm too...seeing the PS on Tues so I'll see what he has to say about my body adjusting to these new parts! My next milestone will be getting rid of this surgical bra 24/7. I'm sooooo done with it by now! I worked on my laptop all day today, one of the rare days where I had good energy. I seem to to be up & down in the energy dept. day by day so I have to take advantage of it when I have some lol! I had a pedi before my surgery too & was so bummed out that no one in the hospital saw my feet, I had those dopey hospital socks on the entire time lol!! I no longer have a functioning short-term memory it seems, so I won't be addressing any of you by name but I want you to know I'm praying for all of you, & hoping that those dealing with struggles in addition to this BC BS get through them quickly! Sending strength to all those having surgery this week & to those recovering, or anxiously waiting for results, or anxiously waiting for surgery or whatever other joys this journey has in store for us! Welcome to the newbies, you've come to the right place to go thru this with an amazing group of women! The support you'll find here will be something you'll wonder how you can ever do without, & fortunately you won't have to! Love you all!",

Over 2cm makes me Stage IIA vs IA, so that may be tipping the scale for me in the chemo direction. I'll have to see what the MammaPrint shows... Grande: if you're considering reconstruction, pre-pectoral implants may be a good option for you since you need to retain your upper body strength. The implants go over the pectoral muscle & that muscle ends up not being cut. There's a good forum here on this & I think there's a PS in Toronto that does them. Feel free to private message me if you have any questions https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/44/topics... Bdagal: love your sense of humor! I cracked up reading your post!! A-Boob: keep those great pictures coming! What morale boosters! 1214Survivor: congrats! I love hearing from you gals who are further along in the process & blazing the trail for us! I also love reading the personal stories & being able to put a face to the names! There's so much more to all of us than BC! It's no surprise that if you give of yourself here, you're also giving of yourself in your \"real life\" & are tremendous role models to those looking up to you... Makes me love you all the more! Win-chimed & GT1965: you remindme how important it is to be knowledgeable about our BC & how we need to be our own best advocates. We're not just a file on a doctor's desk!
