I found it helpful to go to a support group like Gilda's Club or something related just to breast cancer.  Once I knew what questions to ask, the surgeon and oncologist were more helpful to me as a person rather than just a body with abnormal cells!  I still rely on the support group for understanding that cancer isn't just cells, but now a new way to navigate life. Everyone's journey is different...if someone is trying to help but you feel dismissed, go ahead and dismiss them!  It's all about you now.  Every feeling and thought you have is OK...",
