The last nurse that came in to try the last time came back in and they talked about what they thought might be going wrong with the port. Then she asked me if I wanted to do an iv next instead. I told her no that I would come back tomorrow I'd hit my limit. I went that nite and had my hair cut down to about 1/8 of an inch tall all over. And I have being going over it a few times a day with a sticky roller to help with the shedding. I can now sympathize with my long haired cat. Went back in the next day for the iv infusion instead. Still hurt a bit but not NEARLY as much as that dang port. If I have to go thru surgery again for the port to fix it, I'm gonna see about just getting ivs from now on. it's been nothing but problems from day one. to put it in.... day 1~supposiedy the hospital lost my info sat and waited for 3 hours and left day2~different hospital also supposidly didn't have a place for the doc to do surgery.

I got new curtains (real ones this time not homemade) and the room is all painted (light denim blue with pure white trim) I think this is the first time ever I've actually had a nice looking bedroom. I decorate the main rooms of the house and leave that one for last. But since we finally got a new bed hubs suggested we make it nice woohooo! Love to my ladies!",

I used it and conditioner even when I only had 3 hairs to my name. Just for the smell of it. And yes, I like the smell of fireplaces too ROFL. It has worked wonders on my little head. My hair was so brittle after I had it lightened. I used the deep conditioning and it brought it back to life. It does make me feel good \"hearing\" you say its a good product. I kept staring at the bottle and wondering about it. Before all this mess started I went thru a bottle of conditioner and shampoo each month. As of right now I am only 1/2 way thru a bottle that I started using in april of last year. I had the tumour marker thing done a month ago myself. Amazing.. this time last year I couldn'tve told you what that was, or a whole lot of other junk, that I know now :OS Cat story time.... I have a very hateful cat. And we have been doing behavior modifications on her trying to make her nicer. She is one of those that starts out playing and within 2 minutes she is stalking you for the kill and means it. Last night she is flying around the house trying to get somebody to chase her. (she likes to play chase like a dog would... chasie and chaser) Nobody was biting so she is running around throwing her mouse in the air to herself. I'm sitting on my bed folding clothes and she comes tearing down the hallway and aparently didn't see me on the bed. She goes to jump, during a full run, and sees me, tries to stop in midair and ends up running on her back legs for about 5 steps before falling over and shooting under the bed. If nothing else she is good for a laugh occasionally. behavior mods...... there is no playing with kitty unless you use a kitty toy... no fingers... no chasing...no holding a hand over her head... for some reason that one really pisses her off lol.... and you stop often to let her calm down. so far everything is working and she is turning out to be a nicer more loving kitty. Occasionally when she and my son are wound up I let them play chase for just a few minutes and I cut them off before she goes into kill mode. Glad you are feeling better roxi, been sending you good vibes today :O)",

Love to bake though. (looks to make sure adrienne isn't watching LOL). But I do try to set up a menu for 2 weeks at a time. I go thru what meats I have in the freezer and try to plan around that. I found that I actually save money and we eat a bit healthier that way. Angels~ do you take stowaways?? Roxi~ hope your little one feels better soon! RanD~ Glad you are doing better daulink! It's you and me on thursday. If you hold my hand I'll hold yours. Otter~ put me down for something with chocolate in it LOL Karin~ staples in my pantry usually are garlic, onions, some sort of hot sauce and tortillas. Oh and now fresh raw veggies.... somehow my son is 90% vegertarian in a house of carnivores. I've yet to figure that one out. And it can't be cooked veggies either... they have to be raw. Rock~ send me some of that weather you are having. Aren't you glad you aren't in cold snowy NY right now?? Noelle~ how's the sticks? no bruises I hope.

He looked at me and said \"thats a tad long, unless you wanna keep coming in here and seeing us every 3 weeks.\" har har. All the nurses were in great moods today and cheery. When I walked into the infusion room I felt like norm walking into cheers LOL. Then I promptly passed out when they hooked me up. This time hubs had to wake me up when it was done and I'm still zapped this evening. Bought me a digital cancorder tonight. My son will be in his first play in 3 weeks. He only has 3 lines but I am nervous as heck for him. I am hoping the teacher will give his visual cues to help him along. He surprises me all the time with new things and I am sure this will go fine.... he is only in 1st grade lol. Anyway got a very small cheap camcorder so I can tape it. There are more signs of spring showing up each day. Yesterday it was the first robins and my daffies popping up. Today I noticed the lilac bushes are budding. ahhhhhhhh I love this time of year!

By the end of all of this I was begging the to let me come back on friday and just take an IV, it was horrible. They think that my port has turned upside down and I may have to have surgery to get it fixed. *sob* I think at this point I would deal with having an iv each time instead. It was hurting so flippin bad and I am all bruised up again because of it. I did get to go back the next morning and just get the iv instead, which was a walk in a park compared. I have a doc appt on monday to see what the heck is up with the port. The nurses said it shouldn't be hurting nearly this bad. I swear it felt like they had a dull pencil trying to jab it thru. Then to top things off the hair is coming out. I had it shaved down with a #2 at the shop. Sat in the car and bawled with my gf about it. She then took me out for icecream afterwards. Nothing like chocolate to make you feel better. Hubs saw me afterwards and said it wasn't so bad. At least I don't have a lumpy head. Otherwise feeling ok today just a tad tired. They had to switch out my nausea meds and the new ones seem to be doing the trick. Next round...... 26th. I may request to just have it done iv from now on.... only 6x left.",

I personally did not get a wig. Ordered one but long story later I never received it. I spent my bald months with head covers from designwraps (dot)com and a very cute baseball cap. I asked my hubby and others not to shave their head in support. I didn't want to watch their hair grow in when mine was not. Best you can do is be understanding, help her as much as possible. Try to recruit family and friends to make meals for your family and help with the cleaning around the house. Have her check this site out, it helps the soul more than I can tell you. Everything will be fine, just hang in there. God bless :O)",

Not sure if any of you remember my deal with a set of wigs a month or so back. Store refused to release them to me unless we paid full price. (insurance covered 100%) Then they refused to take the cash FROM the insurance and insisted we still paid %100 of the wigs and then they would get more money on top of the from the insurance. Long drawn out process, I had hubs just cancel them. Today we find out that they store went against the contract that they signed with the insurance company by withholding the wigs. I should have had them the day I tried them on unless they had to order them in. So their contract is now canceled with the insurance company and possibly more action will be taken against them. We got a call from them here at the house but we were at work. I'm so glad I wasn't here. I'm sure the lady probably would have cussed us out for all the business she is going to lose now. The 2 things I wanted to have hair for have now passed.... our anny and my bday dinner out.... a little late now. Worked 2 full days past 2 days and I am wiped out. I normally work 5-5.5 hours a day unless I am at home then I can put in more but past 2 I put in 7.5.... Not nearly as many as noelle but I'm still tired.... working in 3d and then metric and converting shit over... urk! First real brain work since all this chemo started. I'm having problems with my left hand... 3 fingers ache pretty bad by the end of each night. I keep waiting for it to fade away and it is only slightly. It's not too bad during the day though. Then today I also notice one ankle all swelled up... so I propped it up to take down the swelling. i just don't want to be put on yet another drug or weekly taxol.... yikes! I'm so close ........ My older sister is (maybe) coming for a visit this weekend. This is about the 4th time she has promised a visit since all of this has started. I keep getting the \"I'm too busy\", \"I have a car show to go to\", blah blah blah. Then she gets upset if I don't email her what is going on or call her.... Not like she doesn't have access to either to contact me. I'm quite upset with her about the whole thing... bless her heart. My mom said she thinks my sister is having a hard time dealing with all of it... well hell what about me? I'm the one who is mortified by needles and is going thru my own personal hell on earth... but gee \"she is having a rough time\". pffffftttttt! Ok I needed to get that out of my system. If she doesn't show on sunday... there is going to be one ticked off chick sitting here. Exfoiliating~..... nope don't do it here. I did for awhile on my arms but I produce too much keratin in my body and it only makes it worse on my arms. As for my face.. I've never had more gorgeous skin than what I have now. Always had a bad time with blackheads and they are cleared up. Have a touch of roseacea.... that is gone. The excess keratin on my arms is mostly gone. Heck if it wasn't for the se's I'd almost stay on chemo just for these benefits... har har. My bday went wonderfully this year. Took mom out to eat the nite before. My boss and my gf took us out for lunch the next day. I must have gotten 30-40 cards from my chemo angel mail. It's been awsome all week. Even though we didn't \"do\" alot of stuff overall, the little things we did do were just all that much more special. Hubby even took me to the mall and he HATES the mall LOL. Told hubs I needed to get props for my pole dance... he doesn't think I have the nerve to do it cause my infusion room holds about 30 people all at once... big room. Now I have a challenge.

FOund out we had 2 mice plugged in at once and the monitor is crapping out on me. Then regular junk from there. I at least forgot I was bald for a few hours Well until the guy they had there that was revarnishing some of their furniture for them came downstairs and asked for help with his cell phone. Got him fixed and sent on his way then it was time to pick up the kiddo. Feel like I chased my tail most of the day today. Not only are eyebrows HIGHLY under appreciated, by most, so are nosehairs.",

I see the doc and head back to the infusion room and my other nurse promptly pulls out the front of my shirt and reaches down my bra to fetch the tubing.Mind you I am in the middle of a room that has about 20 people in it at the time. I just started laughing and accused her of hitting on me and checking out my 1/2 cleavage. 5 months ago I would have been mortified but after showing my chest to everyone in dayton I kinda got used to it.

Been munching on everything passing by me trying to find something that I can taste. I can get a hint of taste occasionally on some foods but not often. At least I have crunch to fall back on. Watched the bucket list today with hubs. Good movie, it hit him harder than it did me though. Will work on the pics sometime this week when I regain most of my fingers... I keep stubbing them.

It knocked my little one off his feet once and he scrapped up his knees poor kiddo. He was trying to help daddy clear out some limbs. Most of the schools in the county are closed tomorrow and 200,000+ are out of power in my county and 700,000 in the next county over. What a mess. Eddie~ YAY!!!!!!!! Once one finds its way home the rest will follow!!! I think you still have more hair than I do at this point. I can't wait for all of us to start posted hair pics! Noelle~ been considering painting my nails but they haven't changed colors too awful bad. They are slightly brownish and just hurt to touch. I'm hoping they don't get any worse. They seem to be growing pretty good as well. Other thinds I have notice...I had oily skin before and it was gorgeous during chemo... It is started to return ever so slightly to oily. My skin keratin problem is starting to return damnit! Ladies, have a wonderful week!!!!!!!!!!! p.s. did you know that crocs were recyclable???? they grind them down and make new shoes out of them and donate them to needy countries. I think I like my ugly shoes even more now.",

We had a family reunion on saturday at ash cave here in Ohio. Not nearly as many people this year. Funny part.... all us sickies were there though lol. I kept telling them we all showed up looking for sympathy and all we had was each other to complain too. It was still nice. Wore me out too. On the way back I got my salad bar!!! I have been dreaming of this salad bar since the day I was banned from having them till after chemo. I got it cleared with my onc, and man it was good. Got back to my mom's house and she has 9 kittens all around 6 weeks old. My very fav kitty age. I sat and loved on everyone of them I could catch. They have about 19 cats all together and all but the kittens are feral. I even had one of the big feral cats come up to me at one point and actually begged to be petted. I was worried it was gonna tear me up when it first walked up to me. But it headbutted me to see what I would do, so I scratched it with my good arm just in case and it ended up in my lap purring up a storm. Mom said this one had just decided this week it wanted to have human contact. If the rest only knew how much I love kitties and would scratch them till my fingers fell off LOL. Overall I feel normal at this point. Wish I had all my energy back and the hurty/tingly fingers and toes are a pain, but this too shall pass. Not that I want to add to my treatment, but it feels odd for the \"rad\"ical ladies to move on and me not being with you. I so want to understand what you all are going thru, but the best I can do is lend you my ear when you need it. Happy Late Birthday Kerry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was out of town and that's my excuse and I am sticking to it LOL DEO~I have also used the crystal rock before as deo. I haven't felt like I needed much deo since this has started. Normally I am a put it on twice a day girl cause it wears out on me. Not so much now. Think I will give the rock another go and see how it works for me now. Would love to not have to use any at all, and just smell purdy all the time naturally. Ladies~ I hope all of you had a wonderful weekend. I sure missed all of you. I had withdrawls out in the woods LOL",

I have to change out the duct filters and stuff before I turn on that badboy. Hubby has been sick for a few weeks with broncitis we think. Little one has had a bad fever for the past 2 days and I have been congested in my noggin and had a sore throat for a few days. Just call us typhoid browns. Kept the little guy home from school past 2 days from the fever and boy he is not happy. He would much rather go to school. I just hope he stays that way in life. Have to get my checkup thru my surgeon soon. I got a letter last week to call in for an appointment. I'm just not in a hurry for it at the moment. I want a week or two without any appts at all.

Debating at the moment to cut it a bit shorter (what I do have keeps growing) so I can watch for new signs of growth. Everyone is different how they react to the tx. I personally was very nauseated even with the drugs they gave me and couldn't eat for quite awhile after each tx. Past 2 tx I've had bad heartburn as well. Bonus... I lost 15 pounds woohoo! I did mine on thursdays and mostly by monday-tuesday I was slightly better. I do some work from home and there are days that it was hard to wrap my brain around what I was doing... very fuzzy headed.

Of course now that it is only 2 days away, I wish I had forced myself into putting up more. There is always next year. I'm having a hard time feeling christmassy this year. Normally its because lack of funds and not being able to buy what I want for friends and family. But this year, I am focused on my next herceptin treatment the monday afterwards. I don't measure time anymore by days or weeks but by when my next treatment is. So my dearest rock, on cmas eve, we can all raise our marshmellow sticks together and show our stars apon thars. Wrap your arms around yourself and hug tight, that is from me. Just know that my thoughts will be with you and all my other ladies in here.",

(they live out in the middle of nowhere) I felt so good and alive that day! Best I have felt in a very long time. The Lord knew we all needed that good day and blessed us with it. We were having so much fun outside that everyone forgot about opening presents lol. I thought of you guys and was wishing you were having great days as well. Have a wonderful evening ladies and I will see you after herceptin tomorrow morning.... (yuck)",

Things like flossing and blowing your nose (unless you are very very sick) are to be done in the bathroom in my house. The last festival we went to had some of those wellness booths at it.

We did some moving around with the military, then back to athens and moved to beaver in my late teens (between jackson and chillicothe) and then got married and hubs and I moved to Dayton. Athens will always be home for me. Karin~ you look stunning! That cut really really looks good on you! My poor hair is STILL standing straight up in the front. I detected a slight leaning the other day but that is it. I can brush my hands backward thru it when its wet and it makes me look like the heat miser. (from cmas show). Mine is still so wild right now. And the cat keeps running her nose thru it doesn't help much. Sue~ YAY 18 days to go. You got any plans on what you are going to do with your time yet? Slept in late this morning, really late <blush>. Trying to decide if we want to go do anything. It'll get here when it gets here LOL. <squishes!>",

Rock~ the only other thing I can think is to go into your add/remove programs and look for that last update and manually uninstall it. You can also trying reinstalling skype again and see if that helps any. OH, and check your volume control box and make sure that it didn't turn off or mute one of the settings.

So into my surgeon I trudged. He said it is most likely scarring and if it doesn't go down then we will do a ultasound on it in a month. Oh the joy. Uti..... they never said yes or no.

The guy that came over to help us was so nice and one of the first people to actually look me in the eye (minus friends and family) since I have gone bald and shiney. After a few minutes I had to tell him thanks for it. He said he didn't understand why people didn't look me in the eye. It actually made me feel human again for the moment. And it didn't hurt that he was quite a little hottie himself. It's the small things that count. :O)",

Along with makeshift temporary padding for the swelling. My therapist was supposed to have ordered more permanent padding for me about a month ago and I still haven't heard anything. She's a tad bit spacey if you ask me. I will be glad to get to a point where I might not have to wear these everynite. Otherwise my day is going pretty well.

I have padding that I wear daily under my bra and a bit more that I wear at nite. It goes under my armpit scross my chest and up towards my neck. Plus I wear an underarmour shirt for a tad bit more compression and to hold it all in place. It sucks... it ROYALLY sucks. My LE lady has been trying to make me wear a sleeve and I refused. They had me wear a temporary one at first and me made me swell up above and below it horribly and I took it off. I do take weekly measurements on 3 spots on my arm (it has gone down from the beginning and is staying down). My chest occasionally on the mast side gets puffy and I do my MLD daily in the shower and on bad days once more at nite. I am surprised they said that you were cured. I was told that it will always be there no matter what. It sucks. Maybe you just need a few more drainage massages and it will go back down. <squish>",

Mainly cause I have horrible anxiety about needles and he couldn't stand to see me go thru all of that... me neither for that matter. If they had said \"yes this works better than the traditional\" then we might have gone that route. The doc said traditional has been proven to work and he would just do dose dense to get me thru it even faster. So now I am down to 4 months instead.

Now.... when you IV pole dance, can you wear stilettos or will the heels get caught up in your tubing? <snicker> I had a whole bunch of things I was wanting to talk about tonight and dang it I can't remember a single thing now... it's only been 30 seconds. sheesh. Went to the store today to pick up a compression shirt. My therapist suggested that I get one of those under armour shirts to wear to bed. So after cruising the sporting goods store I head to the front counter and got waited on by this young feller. He holds up the shirt and starts to praise how wonderful they are and how comfy and how much he loves to wear his. Now I'm looking at him and just kinda snickered and told him ya know... I think we are going to be wearing our shirts for 2 totally different reasons. I wasn't exactly going to be wearing mine to look good for the opposite sex. OH now I remember what it was I was gonna write.... duh. My mom has been up helping with my son. I seem to be spending more time sleeping than anything else at the moment. (One more ac to go yay!) Last nite hubs and my son were in bed sleeping and we were talking and playing with a scarf. We decided that once I got it on that I needed \"hair\". So we dug out some pipe cleaners and proceeded to make curls with them and tucked them into the scarf all around the edges. Then I posed for pics. It felt good to just laugh at it all. My onc is having another HER test done before he decides to put me on herceptin. I guess I am a \"3\" on the graph, whatever that means. He said there is another test that they can do to make certain that I am positive. They test with an ultraviolet light and it is more sensitive. So I have been focusing on being HER-. It will be one year less of stabs and pokes that I will have to endure. I'm up for waterfalls or mountain ranges with john denver blaring in the background.",

The lady who schmeared me with some asked if I used it cause my hands were so soft..... Nope, I'm a handlotion junkie. I'm so bad that my mom always said she was surprised that I didn't squieep out of their arms when they hugged me. Finally shaved the top of my head tonight... missed a few spots but got most of it. When those new hairs come in I wanna see them in all their glory. What does hubs do first thing.... calls me kojak. Good thing I love that man LOL. I even exfoliated my chrome dome at the same time. Thought of you noelle the whole time, thinking you'd be proud of me. As for being cancer free.... I think I will consider that part once chemo is done. It seems like a good point to start. I may ask my doc about it though. Supposidly they got it all out during surgery so that would make be CF now wouldn't it? We made it thru the first day of 1st grade! He came out of the school all smiles and excited. So that means they didn't lose him or send him in the wrong direction. The principle saw him head towards me and came a flying himself. He wanted to make sure that I knew they did the room testing for sounds (ds is hearing impaired) and the levels were really really good and that he checked on ds himself a few times today to see how he was doing. We may not have to be bears with these people just yet. Last year was a fight to the death..... we won.

You might have scratched yourself by accident. I've done it once or twice myself. Hopefuly it is nothing major. Normally that is a scary area if there is blood where there isn't supposed to be. Looks like we are going to skip fireworks this year. A little bummed about it but on the other side I really don't want to go sit in the middle of a ton of people with possible germs floating around. Anyone else doing anything fun this year? My mom took my son home with her yesterday for his first sleep over with mawmaw. They live 2.5 hours away. So far so good. They are planning on bringing him home on saturday and my dad will see me first time without hair. That's going to be very hard on me. Dad told us girls all our life \"girls have long hair\", even though my mom has always had shorter hair lol. He did ask my mom to get a pic of me without my hat and bring it home for him.... I think it was to prepare himself beforehand. A nice big daddy hug will make me feel better, I've been waiting on that one for awhile now. *dances out signing \"Rocky mountain hiIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGH colorado!\"*",

My feet and fingertips are really giving me a go this time. They are still hurting today. I can't wait for this to be over with!",

It seems I have way more friends online than I do in real life at this point. Ya'll don't mind if I come to see you in my jammies and that's a plus LOL. If nothing else we can make a \"moving on\" thread or even keep this one going. Rock~ prayers and good thoughts for your mom Otter~ for yours as well sweetie. Eddie~ where the heck r ya girl?? Pain is mostly gone for me today. I get achy more at night than anything else right now. Think I'm gonna try to get my house clean again the next few days. I even sat and paid some bills. I got a call from my insurance company this morning reminding me to pay my bill.... opps.... I don't think they'll take \"I was in a chemo pain/drug stupour for a few days\" excuse. Got it sent right out. My boss calls me last nite and when I answer the phone the tells me that if I don't stop answering the phone so cheery he is gonna tell the big boss (my best friend) that I was faking sick and make me go back to work.  har har har. Boy can I whip up a fake cough in a hurry LOL. I am gonna try to head back for a few days starting next monday. Told him I just don't think my knees are in prime for the basement steps today. He offered to let me ride one of the greatdanes up and down the stairs. At this point the doggies hasn't seen me in a few months and will probably waller me to death as it is. Our office is in their basement of the house..... and I have constant companionship of 2 greatdanes and 5 kitties.... all wanting my attention constantly. So basically I get paid for scritching ears all day. It works for me",

My gf and I hit the book stores and the used cd places and had lunch. All around is was just nice to get out. Unfortunately the heat got to me and made me swell up pretty good. I had to take off my rings and pop them in my pocket. Towards the end of things my \"bad\" arm starting aching from the swelling... that was interesting, first time that has happened. Tried to keep it up all evening and getting ready to do my MLD yet again. I am determined to not have to wear one of those darn sleeves. I've had enough crap to deal with. I have a doc appt with my surgeon tomorrow morning. My onc wanted me to go see him because he felt an \"odd spot\" on my scar. So tomorrow is a follow up with the surgeon, I think he said a few weeks ago I might be getting an ultrsound tomorrow but I can't remember. He said last time he thought it was just a cyst or a fluid filled spot if anything. I keep trying to feel the spot myself and my entire scar feels bumpy to me.. I dunno, trying not to be freaked out over it. I'm over this already and want to go back to normal boring me. I hope everyone is feeling better this evening. I'm wishing you lots of good vibes.

I tried to tell her that they needed to be careful because some bc women cannot have the soy products. She flat out told me that it was made by scientists that knew what they were doing and the doctors do not, and it was the good part of the soy plant not the bad part that was used. Now I was told very little or no soy at all because of being er+ and the body thinks it is estrogen blah blah. The lady got very defensive over the whole deal.

I had a few odd sensation here and there last nite and would sit and wait to see if they lasted or kept going. The worst I had was at 11pm last nite I started into some nausea so I popped my generic ativan and went to bed..... almost thought it was gonna come back up and then it kicked in and things were good to go. I do have to say it was nice to finally sleep some last nite and wake up refreshed and not running for a nausea pill. I'm sure things will kick in and hit me at some point, but so far I'm MUCH happier. I don't know if dosing is regional or not, from my viewpoint. There are several docs in my onc office and from what I gather they each have their own ideas on what works best and go that route. I'm in Ohio btw. I did ask about me taking my steriods the day before compared to you ladies all taking them the nite before or early morning. He said he found that there is less se's from the steroids given this way. Many women experience less swelling and/or weight gain, and don't have to take extras after the tx so they don't have to have withdrawls.... I'm all for that personally. And I won't be starting my herceptin till after my taxol. He said this way if there is ANY allergic reactions then they know exactly what drug to blame. Plus he said I might be able to get a 3-4 week break before starting the herception. THAT would be awesome! Oh and he said that women on taxorene tend to have more se's that with taxol. I mentioned to hubs about some of you ladies playing real mahjong. I think we are going to start looking for a set of our own soon wooohoo! I've always wanted to try it in RL. Does the tiles come with a hint button when you get stuck?? ha ha Not sure if anyone else is having this problem but I'll pass it along. To go with drippy nose I am also getting manhattan sized boogies, that glue themselves in with superglue and hurt like hell. I'm putting high powered pure vitamin e oil on a qtip and rubbing a little on the inside of my nose. It seems to help tremendously. yum! chocolate banana bread!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! where's mine??? Maybe they should make the mast bra throwing a competition at the yearly bc walks. Kinda like a punkin chunkin for them LOL.",

He showed my hubs exactly how they should access it just in case. I'm praying that it goes much smoother this time around. Last treatment, besides the extra jabbing and going back the next day, went rather smooth. They changed out my nausea meds and I felt just fine. Of course tired a bit longer but I'll take that anyday over being sick to my stomach. I was surprised that my neulasta shot didn't give me any aches this time around like the first time. Coulda been I was too obsessed with my bald head to notice. Got my BRC results back finally... negative WOOHOOOOOOO! My poor bald head can't decide if it is cold or hot. Cold bare and hot under something. And having the breeze blow thru 1 inch of 5 strands of hair is an interesting sensation.

Cris have a fabulous time at WD! I want to take our son before he gets \"too old\" to appreciate it. Story of the week..... Well I have been waiting for the past 30 days for the wig store to release my wigs. My insurance company will pay up to $300 for wigs and I had 2 picked out. My hubby called on thursday to see if they had gotten payment yet for the wigs. It was a no of course. But the lady said we could come in and give them a credit card number and they would let me have one of them. Not a big deal, I was ok with that. BUT...... after many phone calls back and forth with my husband. It turns out that the total, after the provider discount, was only $117. So hubs went down to talk to the people that dealt with it (his work is self insured) and they said I shouldn't have to wait for these wigs so they gave hubs cash so we could just go pick them up. Hubs called the store back and the lady said she wouldn't take the cash and that we would have to pay the entire amount, including the provider discount, then when/if she got a check from the insurance it would be marked paid. ($234) She doesn't give discounts if you pay cash for them..... huh??? So hubs argued with her about it and it turns out that if we paid the full amount ($234) she would get that plus the $117 from the insurance!?!?!?!? Then to top things off she told hubs that the foob we had gotten and the 2 bras the lady that waited on me subtracted the tax instead of adding it to the bill and she said we owed for that as well!?!?!? Well the foob and bras are completely paid for by the insurance as well. I told hubs just to cancel the wigs altogether and I would go without. And by the time that we submitted another claim for a different store I would have hair growing back in already. After many hours of frustration for hubs and his company, they are going to turn this lady in and have her insurance contract ripped up. It's bad enough to go thru what I am going thru without the added harassment of somebody trying to get more money out of you.",

This bday is a bit more special because a) I'm coming thru a dark tunnel and seeing the end finally b) I have all of you here to help celebrate. Took my mom out to eat tonight for a thank you/birthday dinner before she goes home once again tomorrow. Oh it was so yummy. We went to Bravo's... and I drank 4 glasses of raspberry tea... I'm on the verge of floating lol. She picked me up a bday cake today at the store and we will have it a bit later... yes a day early but she is heading home in the morning. Hopefully we won't have to drag her 2.5 hours next treatment to help with my son. She has been here every other week since all this has begun, for all surgeries and treatments. We couldn't have done it without her. Noelle~... how about some raspberry jam in between 2 slabs of double chocolate cake with a chocolate ganache (sp?) drizzled over it... *drool* sue~ I pray everything turns out ok for you. I'm with you in spirit sweetie. rock~ tomorrow is your last??? I'm celebrating with you tomorrow!!!!! Jean~ your mom is in my prayers as well! Good luck on #3 tomorrow I love the avs people are posting you are a beautiful bunch of women! Good luck to those in tx this week.. one more closer ladies! And for those with bone pain... I found so far that 2 aleve in the morning is cutting down on the pain alot for me. I hope it helps somebody else as well. ChemooooOOOOooooo",

And with us taking the herceptin things will be good. I just want to get to the other side. MLD is manual lymphnode drainage. They took out all my nodes on my affected side. Since they did that my surgeon sent me straight to a therapist to prevent lymphodema from setting in. He said some docs just wait to see if you swell up before you do anything and he thought it was better to get a head start on it. So I had 6 weeks of therapy right after my surgery and then I went a few weeks without any problems at all untill I hit the steroid/taxol phase and now I am holding water like a water tight bucket. They teach you how to do the massage yourself and help the fuilds move around in your body and not pool in one area. I haven't had any problems with my arm swelling until recently and that is because my chest on my bad side is quite puffed up. I'm a \"d\" on my good side and almost an \"a\" on my bad LOL.",

Doc said b6 is VERY good to take while on taxol. Told me 200mg 2-3 times a day. Gonna go look for some probably tomorrow. I also have a spot on my mast scar that they are looking at right now. Surgeon told me it was more than likely nothing and wants to see me back in a month. All these drugs running thru your system, how the heck would anything grow makes me wonder. He said it was most likely scar tissue or fluid build up inside scar tissue. So many things we will all worry about for now on.

Can I make it thru one more of these? Will I ever feel normal again? I hear thunder outside. I sure hope that it does rain. We haven't had any rain here in well over a month. If I could move I would do a rain dance. Linda~ try making the picture smaller before you upload it. PB has problems with larger pics that may be it. weight~ the 7 pounds I gained ....

They are SUPPOSED to be turned on when you get out of surgery... mine however were not. They forgot to turn them on. When they did turn them on, to be honest I felt no difference. I had 2 of them going and they weighed about 5-10 pounds total and hurt my neck.

We were told before this it would be only 1/2 hr long and we'd be out the door...... wrong! I guess if I am there every 3 weeks it is a 90 minute ordeal. At least it isn't 3-4 hours long like the taxol was. I napped thru part of it cause of the benedryl and I feel pretty normal at the moment. I'm all for that. I keep waiting on se's to hit like all the other times. Talked to the onc about %'s today. About it coming back and junk. I guess with my exact diagnosis 80% of the women are cured and about the same live. Wish it was higher numbers but I'll take what I can get. I was hoping for in the 90's. About 2 months back, I was in to get my neulasta shot and came across another lady sitting there. She was a week or so away from her surgery, she had chemo first like some of you. I sat and talked to her a bit and told her my experience with my mastectomy and how I felt that losing my hair was way worse than losing the boob etc. We went over several different things, I got my shot and wished her well as I went out the door. I was sitting there wiating to get hooked up today and I look over... there she sat. I just had to ask how her surgery went. It took her a moment to recognize me and she just lit up. She told me that my talk with her helped her out so much and when different things happened she would think back to our conversation. I told her there had been many times I thought of her also and had hoped all had went well for her. It really brightened my day to know just that little bit helped somebody else going thru the same thing. I believe that God put me in her path that day to ease her mind about what was coming. I didn't get to spend alot of time with her today, her wbc was low so she was coming back the next day. But I'm sure I will see her again in 3 weeks. She is on weekly taxol and me on 3 wk herceptin. Oh lookie, my post is ALMOST as long as eddie's...

I am now done sayingest (ya i know its not a word but it fit) I also worked on a new layout for a job yesterday. Two minor changes and it was approved. YAY me! Considering all the design knowledge that I have, all of it was learned along the way and not schooled, it made my day. Bossman is determined that I will be a full designer and do the large machines without guidance one day. I'm happy to stick with the small ones for now. In college I learned how to draw it and make it in the machine shop (sorta), that's it. And nowadays most places really don't care about presentation. As long as it is slapped on a piece of paper and \"maybe\" everything is documented that's all most care about. Me.... I want it to look good as well, so does bossman so we have  a common ground. We do sometimes work with another company that has an older gentleman that still hand drafts designs. That is truly a lost art. His handwriting is so perfect. I'm betting he can handdraft faster than a person on a computer. I can talk about pencils and papers and computers all day.... I digress lol. Last nite we spent the evening at gf and bossman's house playing a role playing game with each other. We have our office in the basement hooked up with their house computers so we can play. Fun evening for all. And like eddie, I also feel a bit more normal. I have 3 more weeks before my herceptin starts.. I want to pack as much \"normal\" in those 3 weeks as possible. And that includes talking to my head and hoping it makes my hair grow faster LOL",

Few my gf and her dd last nite and tonight looks like we are feeding them again and my hubs sister and her family. I guess they declared the entire county in an emergency state. Schools are still out today because of downed trees and such. At least the weather is nice and cool for those without power. Good luck to the \"rad\"ical ladies today!!!!!!",

I just want him to do well and not let his ears hold him back any. I'm rambling I know.... I'm hoping that it eases my mind to do so. Have a fab day to the original group, the newbies, the lurkers, and the ones we WON\"T forget. besos, Jen",

Kerry~My surgeon sent me to a therapist for LD right after my surgery. He said he was for preventing anything before/if it happens. I had swelling right in the beginning and we got it to return to normal. I did good for awhile until taxol came along and then my chest area swelled up. So right now we are working on that area to get it down and hopefully it will stay down once all the chemicals are out of my system. I do a manual massage twice a day right now to help the body find new ways to send the fluid out. I guess with every surgery there is a chance to develop LD. Since I had the left mastectomy and then they had to take out more nodes, I have a higher risk of getting it. I am determined not to. We just have to see how things go over time. Therapist has conned me into ordering a sleeve for the days I do swell up from the heat or whatever. I have fought that battle this entire time.

Randie~ If that is the only time you have cried during the stabbing then you are my hero. I bawled the first 5 times and I mean bawled/had a fit. Horrible needle phobic here. This is my personal version of hell I think. Noelle~ why was I expecting you to use the word muggles instead of normals? I had to backtrack and reread what you wrote cuase in my head it said muggles LOL. I found that my nails changed right after I started with taxol. They grew and looked fine until then. Now they are changing color and hurt to the touch. My day~ first thing this morning my son sees me directly out of the shower and asks \"mommy why did you pull out your eyebrows?\" So I sat him down before school and had to explain that the medicine I am taking made my hair come out but that means that it is working and mommy will be better very soon. We don't say it outloud what I have, we just say that I am sick. At 7 yrs old, I don't think that cancer needs to be a part of his vocabulary... that's just our choice. Then I get to wrok for a few hours then off to my therapy session. Turns out my regular therapist either explained my MLD incorrectly or I misunderstood massively. So the boss therapist went over everything with me point by point again. I have a better understanding of all of this now.... for the moment lol. I did ask her if this swelling is something that is taxol.meds related and she thinks that it is. I went for 3-4 weeks without any therapy and nothing swelled till a few weeks ago and POOF gained 7 pounds of water overnite~ literally. So hopefully once I am done with this drug I can get it back under control. I want to go a day without thinking the word cancer, lymphodema or counting down till my next toxic cocktail.... won't that be nice! Eddie~ got your floaties on yet dearie? I'm sitting here blowing mine up ready for next thursday!",

But the way mine has been going the therapist thinks that I won't have a problem with it or that it may go away all together. I am all for that. The whole thought of it freaks me out to no end. Either way I am trying to learn how to do it by myself just in case. I've seen pics of full blown LD and I never want to get to that point if I can help it. sleeves: I got measured for one this past week. If my insurance pays for it I am going to get the one that comes up to the top of your shoulder and has the strap that goes across the chest. I think I will be able to get one off the shelf instead of custom fit... hopefully. nodes: just one pit, one is bad enough. The surgery site is right in the crook of my armpit and my bra edge tends to fall right on top of it. I need to find something that works in that area. Linda~ please don't wait till you have a problem to get it looked at. At least meet with them once get some baseline dimensions so you can keep a check on it at home. And they can tell you how to do the at home massage on days you might need it. I have some video links myself I need to watch and work on my technique. waffle weave blankie: OHHHH I have one of these too and I LOVE IT! Darn things stretch after a few years of love though. Spent the day out running amuck. Ran into walmart and picked up a few decorations for outside. My son is driving us nuts wanting to put up the stuff. Me... I'm a cmas decorator. I want one of those houses that light up the block. Bad side to that is that the neighbors keep catching up to me because our house looked good. I'd rather that happen then look around and not see any lights for the holidays. I still love to drive around, listen to cmas music and looks at the lights. Oops got sidetracked..... anyway got a HUGE spider web for the front of the house that lights up. That is good enough for halloween. I found a display in the garden center of spring bulbs that the proceeds went to SGK foundation. I got me a few of those to plant. I also got to meet a fellow baldy for the first time in real life. I noticed her and just walked up and asked how she was feeling today. She also had just finished up her chemo recently. It was a nice day out. The air is crisp, the gas was 50 cents cheaper and the sun was shining ahhhhhhhhhhh :O)",

I talked with the doc yesterday about my swelling and not sleeping well. She said that if that and the hot flashes do not taper down, they will probably put me on a low dose anti-depressant. yay more pills! I told her I would wait and see first before I get on that bandwagon. I did talk to her about being bummed that most of my buddies (you guys) are close to being done and here I am looking at another year in front of me. Then she put it in perspective for me. She said most women who get stuck with radiation wish they could have gone my route instead because of the se's. Double edged sword I guess. Don't get me wrong, I am very excited most of you are so close to having this behind you. But it's like looking out a window and waving to you guys as you get to go out and play and I have to stay inside just a bit longer. It sux. I have 15 more herceptins to go..... ending NEXT september. awww *razzberries* I did get her to explain why some ladies get the radiation and why others do not, so that is a bit clearer for me. And my tx went well. Barely felt the prick this time.. pulling it out though hurt a bit. I slept pretty much thru the entire thing, it was a good benedryl day lol. I do have to check my blood pressure the next week a few times. It was out site yesterday. They checked it 4x while I was there and right before I left it was almost back down to normal. Hubs thinks I was just a bit wound up over it all. Not sure why though. Hair update~ its finally starting to fill in the male pattern baldness....FINALLY. I was sweating that part.

Living in Ohio we get all of the seasons in full glory. Fall is one of my fav seasons. I love the smell of the air, the crispness and everything that goes with it..... including fall festivals! The garlic fest will be next month as will the Bob Evan's festival (yes the restuarant) Walking around these are the highlights of my year. Not to mention all the goodies you can buy while there....yum! While fiddling with the pics today, each of you made me laugh and smile. I spent 20-30 minutes on each of you erasing backgrounds and pasting you into the group photo. I don't think I could have made it this far without each and everyone of you. It was your support, guidance, and care that brought me thru some very dark days and I thank each of you for it. Wish the cropping would have turned out better, I never was that good at doing that. I just wanted all of us to be \"together\" in victory. Ok enough mushy crap. Love you guys!",

How about them gas prices!?!?!?!?!?!? Down to $1.73 in some areas here, most are at $1.88... I am SO loving this!!!!!!!!",

Even though most of us in this group have finished or are right at the end of chemo you are more than welcome to hang out and find peace with us. These ladies have been my angels throughout this process. As for it getting harder, your symptoms, most generally last 3-4 days the first time around. #2 they may last 4-5 days and so on. It just seems to last a little longer each time depending on what you are taking. I was on double dense AC and the 1st one I was down for about 4 days, by the last treatment it took me a week to recoup. Don't be afraid to ask for help from family and friends. It's the hardest thing in the world to do but if they ask to help out let them. Best wishes to you, and I hope to keep seeing you pop in :O) Jen p.s.

You tuck it right into your bra in that area. They are washable in the washer (wooohoo) and very easy to get used to wearing. I bought 3 of them personally so I have one that can be dirty, one to wear and a clean one on the side for when I am too lazy to do laundry that day. Oh and it looks like they are on sale right now..bonus! When that area on me gets swelled up and achy I wear mine for a day or two and the swelling goes down. If nothing else, it keeps the edge of your bra strap from riding in that tender area. http://www.bandagesplus.com/prd/64/679/Kimbe-Swell-Spot.html   <------ they are not the ones ones who sell this one, now that I see it is backordered.

The message from him was quote \"take it with my blessings\". He musta been in a goofy mood today LOL. So Now I take 2 of those darn things a day with my liquid life vitamins. I hate taking pills. I'm worried about my gf.... About 6 years ago I was having problems with my period. It was SUPER heavy and lasted forever. My gyn told me I had too much estrogen in my body and put me on a low dose birth control pill to regulate things. She is now having the same problem. It's thrown up a red flag in my head..... What if that was the start of my bc? I'm going to keep on her about self checking and getting those yearly checkups done. I refuse to let another person I know go thru this if I can help it. I'm probably being paranoid, but it goes with the territory anymore I think. She is hoping for early menopause. I told her to stand next to me during a good hotflash and she will change her mind on that one. Adrienne~ I totally understand wanting results right then. It's hard for us to wait after what the past year has brought us. I did a sneaky my last ultrasound and asked to see the pics of the tumour. Now I have an idea of what to look for on the screen. Not that I am schooled in reading grey fuzzies but it makes me feel better. Noelle~ hang in there best you can girl! I'm going to order again as soon as I am able. Ya I know that won't do a whole lot...... RanD~ If I was closer we'd be all over those eggs as well. Ya'll are making me want to get a few chooks for my backyard.

I hid in the house yesterday trying to stay cool. We have window units and are trying to not put them in till the real hot weather happens. That was miserable. I started counting how many I had yesterday..... it was a slow HF day and I had 13. I hate this so much. My gf had her hysterectomy on friday and is going to have hormone patches.... I'm jealous. Kerry~ So glad to see you again! I hope everything goes wonderfully for you tomorrow!!!! RanD~ Love ya daul! This will be the thing that works, I just know it! Another day for me sitting around the house, most likely all week. Out of work .. yet again. If this keeps up I may have to look for another job in the evenings where in case work does pick up a bit I can work both. I just hate the thought of working at a lesser pay and more hours trying to make up the difference. 3 out of my 4 baby birdies have flown away this weekend. I was surprised at how fast they had feathers pop up and out they went. The last one is stretching its wings real good this morning, so I'm sure it will be gone soon. Then I am tossing the wreath away they lived in. I made it out of pinecones several years back and have used it for cmas each year. At least it went out with a bang. This morning cooled down a tad from the 85+ degrees the past 2 days. Gonna be a high of 60 tomorrow. With these hot flashes I may have to move to alaska for the next 5 years. L/S Jen :O)",

With my kiddos bday on thursday and his mini trip and then we got a new car out of the blue on friday! I've been driving the same car for 12 years. It ran beautifully and never any major problems. I told hubby if they would give me low enough payments then we could get something. I got the guy ,after many hours, down from 235 a month to 150 a month. Which is what I wanted. And I came home with a 2004 jeep liberty.  (pics on fb) I had another couple ask me if I stood there and cried to get that price. Told them nope... just prayed about it in the dealer and was stubborn. I'm so excited. I've always wanted a jeep wrangler anyways but right now that is not family friendly. So this one is close enough. Hubby named it frogger cause of it being green lol. he even offered for my bday to have a mp3 hookup added to it! Ok enough about the car lol. Today is also our 12 anny sure doesn't seem that long but yet, I canthardly remember him not being there. Oh I forgot a small story about the aquairum.... hardly anything to get good pics of because it was so packed. We are almost to the end and come around the corner.... OTTERS! OF COURSE I had to get a pic of those... and we all know why :O). I'll post their pic on fb soon. Have a great day ladies, all my love! Jen",

I can't wait!  Had to take kitty to the vet this week, When I had her groomed a month ago they nicked her side and it wasn't healing up all the way. So  $60 shot later we were done. I keep looking for cheaper/closer places to the house to take her but always end up going back to them. We love this vet.... they are just 20 minutes away and with a howling cat in the backseat it seems like hours. This time around they ran out of rooms and we got put into the main vets office to wait. (we were seeing the 2nd vet) He came walking in to get his stuff to go home and took my kiddo to his personal closet. He let ryan pick out a snack and let him play with his golf clubs. Brave man. I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend. Love to you all! Hello sweet Randie! You keep those other angels in line ;O)",

Had to have help in the shower part though, my back DOES NOT like for me to be walking stooped over. Everyone at the hospital was super sweet and I was so glad I asked for a private room. The anesthesia did a number on my bladder tso I had to have a by the bed potty. Robin if you can swing a private room, I highly suggest it. The only issues that I have is that my flap is a bit cool to the touch. I guess it has to get back in the swing of things... I hope. I'm sure I will be paranoid until I hear from the doc its ok. It's pink with hints of bruise so thats a good thing. The flap side is bigger than the real side.... doc said it was better to be bigger than smaller when they go back in and adjust with lipo. It makes since. I was able to update on facebook because I signed up for mobile facebook before the surgery..  I wanted to be able to update people easily.

Robin~ before you go for surgery, stock up on tons of gauze. Especially some of the big fluffy stuff, you'll need a cushion. And as for the reshaping, if you looked at me right now I look like a d on one side and maybe a ee on the other. He filled in ALL the gaps that were taken out. in 3 months there will be lipo I think.

Ok you asked for it..... here is a small taste... On my tummy incision, on the right hand corner there is a leaky spot. A little leaky wouldn't be so bad. This started out like a flippin zit 2 days ago. I got out of the shower and hubby was helping me dress wounds and stuff just started pouring down my leg. Probably about 1/4-1/2 cup of fluids and proteins. Took about 40 minutes to get it to slow down. I stopped putting expensive gauze on it and broke out kotex instead. I am also using them as padding across my tummy for the binder. My new boob size is close to a EE easily! And my real one is a large c I think. Doc keeps telling me to not even loook at it cause of the swelling and got very close in size. Please Lord let this just be swelling cause I feel deformed at the moment. And its not really anything you can hide either. He filled in under my armpit as well were they took out nodes. Under this boob a few days back I found a blister. He says it is very common not to worry about it. \"It's major surgery\". It went down a bit and now I found another one on my tummy this morning. they don't hurt just annoying that it is there. Old boob......The seam underneath has split. And hurts like a MoFo. Each day it seems to split a bit more and he did not seem concerned about this either. I'm worried there is going to be a skin graft that will have to be done there. Otherwise the boob is very cute shaped. Finally gone 2 days without major chills and shivers or high fever. Been running a low one but with as much as I have had done that is to be expected. Doc said tuesday the last drain is coming out and the fluid needs to be below 30..... I'm still getting 100 ish out of it. Hell if I knew how to make it less I'd be all over that in a heartbeat. I'm sure my problems are very common for him to deal with but Some are really bothering me alot. I'm gonna nail him down on tuesday, point at a spot and make him look closely. I still have all my staples at the moment they aren't bugging me as much right now. Plus today I am getting around a bit better. I'm seriously bored, and been trying to figure out what to use to wipe my beautocks while hubby goes back to work. I can reach the edge of the canyon but my donkey won't go down the trail. On the good side I was able to stand up thru most of my shower today. That made me feel pretty good. :O) sorry you asked yet?",

I pray yours goes much more smoother than mine did. :O) a tall stool to go in the shower to sit on. shoestring with a keychain on the end to hang your drains on while in the shower. extra thick maxi pads, to pad the incision areas under the binder. they get a bit tender. If you develop leaky areas, newborn baby diapers turned insideout are way cheaper than gauze. ~ I'm feeling a tad bit stronger this morning. only got up twice last nite to pee instead of 5 times and slept till 10.

On the other end of the line was this cute giggly voice that brought me out of it, rock called me. I don't think she could have had better timing. I definately needed those laughs. Felt so much better after the call and had a good nights sleep to boot. Had another doc appt today. I feel like I live in that office right now. He cleaned up some edges of my second split spot and told me to stuff gauze down in it twice a day. That will be interesting I'm sure. My fever has cleared up so far and I feel alot better over all. Still have a few leakies, the pampers company needs to write me thank you notes for keeping them in business right now. Looks like friday around lunch time I will be getting sewn back up. Doc said it will take less than an hour so thats good. I feel like friday is my light at the end of the tunnel. I tell ya, I don't think I could handle much more at this point. I've seen it all, done it all, bought the damn t-shirt and it shrunk in the wash. I can't wait for the day he says I can soak in the tub, I have a bathbomb calling my name.

For a place who does mammos neither she nor the mammo girl had ever seen a trammy boob. Both were looking real close and asking questions. I tossed out there if they wanted to feel it. I've never seen 2 hands come out so fast to feel up a boob in my life. lol Right now I am still looking for ways to save up for the lipo to have it done. I was going to pass but hubby said this is my only chance ever to get it done if I really wanted it. I would just because the trammy left me a bit odd looking in the stomach area and my pants keep falling off. Plus its a fast way to loose some weight. I just want to be done. baby steps... Happy weekend!",

My best story is such..... now mind you I have built, by myself the last 5 computers we have had. Occasionally had to ask a question or two along the way, but otherwise all me from scratch. I was talking to my younger sister's husband about computers (she was not in the room at the time) and he was asking which components are good out right now.. yada yada. She walks in the room and announces that I don't know what I am talking about that he should talk to her friends..... cause they went to college. Nevermind I've been to college twice so far, for 2 different subjects. If you say the sky is blue she will even argue on that one. I stopped talking to her years ago because of this. If she is in the room I might say one or two things but that is it. This is also the sister who refuses to get a checkup at the doctor. Keeps saying \"I can't afford the copay\" my answer to that was..... \"so you can afford to pay for multiple surgeries and $10,000 treatments instead?\" sigh*... I digress... Whew!

I am really dreading this to be honest. I'll be shocked if I am able to find anything. It has to be in the evenings, so my dh can be home to watch my son, and I'll probably end up working all weekend as well. This way if my normal job has work coming in I can still work during the day (take ry with me). Granted I could hire a babysitter, but if I did that, I would be working just to pay for that. I'm at a loss on what to do. I am NOT willing to go to fastfood at all. I have been there done that. I'm sure we could survive on just dh pay, it will just be very tight. He is trying to encourage me to get the job by bribing me with a new car LOL. The one I drive now is 14 years old and we have it for 12. I shouldn't have told him I had car fever LOL.

About midmorning one hole was absolutely killing me so I added a bit more cushion and kept on going. By last night I decided to investigate what was going on. Turns out my original gauze pad had worked itself down into the hole and had got stuck (so much for non stick). I had to soak it out. Talking about a huge relief afterwards.

Both of them have such a wonderful energy that they give off. It was an awesome visit! I do feel bad for my nervous chatter though... I kinda talked a tad too much *blush* Had a appt with my ps today. We are ready for my next faze in this crazy messed up world of bc. He is going to \"tweek\" my trammy side and take out the harder areas that I have. And as an added bonus I am getting a bit extra lipo around my tummy. Bad part... I have to find $1300 to pay for that part, insurance doesn't cover it. If it is meant to be, it will work out. I have a mammo on monday I'm oh so looking forward to... *sacastic*. Life is moving along. Had an iep meeting for my son this week. They brought in a family conselor to the meeting which immediately put me on the defense. They kept saying my son sounded depressed and stressed and needed someone to talk to. This child is happy go lucky 24-7. They tossed out that they think he is upset over my being sick and it was affecting his speech (he knows nothing that except mommy was sick and her medicine made her hair fall out). I broke down in the meeting crying when they come up with that one. Then something was said that took me till later in the afternoon to realize what was going on. One person said \"the kids I normally work with are way worse than ryan, but we have the means to be able to help him so we are going to try this out\". Basically they are looking for more money out of the county. Ryans whole problem..... when he is nervous he kinda stutters. Ya know, this child didn't have more than 20 unintelligable words 4 years ago because of his hearing loss and will now talk your leg off. He begs to read \"just one more book\" every single night. He is in the top 1/4 of his class. He LOVES discovery channel and his teachers are amazed at his vocabulary. But yet, they saw fit to make me feel like it is my fault he gets nervous reading in front of the class cause of my bc. Hubby was ready to kill at this point. The conselor felt the need to tell me if I needed to talk I could contact her. She is not worth an ounce, that you ladies are, to me. Ok I'm done bitching for the moment..... *sigh. On the lighter side of things... hubby and ry have been making a new flowerbed with a pond included out front all week. Now if only my flowers I ordered would get here we would be set. pics on FB. My love to all, :O)",

Turns out she had stage 4 endemetriosis (sp?). I'm just glad it went well. It was my first time being there for a surgery and me not being the one chopped up. Kinda odd in a way.

Today I went in for my herceptin and talk with the doc and I told her how many I was having... 7-12 on the good days. She looked at me shocked and said that was unacceptable to have to deal with for the next 5 years. So now I am on another med to see if it will help any. I'm currently taking 2 tablespoons a day of organic flax seed oil and she added in effexor to  it now. If this one doesn't work she will try another one. They gave me samples of the effexor to test out for 5 weeks. Better than spending the $130 on them and it not working like the other 2 I've tried. The flax seed oil is sold in health food stores in the fridge section. It's named barlean's organic flax oil. The lemonade flavored kind isn't too awful if you mix it with a shot of cranberry juice. If nothing else, it's good for the heart. Herceptin was uneventful yet again. I think 5 or 6 left to go. Depends on if doc has me stop at the beginning of september or the end. Anyone heard from rand today?? I tried to call but didn't get much out of the person I talked to. I'm not sure if it was a nurse or not but didn't recognize the name. I pray it's working rand!!!!!!!!!!",

I guess it is better than nothing. I told hubs that if I get it, if my real job starts to pick up I am quitting and he agreed. I wonder how much longer this economy can go on like this. Yesterday was my little guy's 8th birthday. We took off to cincy and spent the day. We visited the newport aquarium and the natural history museum to see the automated dinos. he wasn't too sure about the dinos. Granted they were HUGE, moved and growled at you. Very neat to see. My only complaint about them was that they charged $15 a person to get in and you had about 15 minutes of stuff to look at. They spread things far apart to make it seem like you were walking more. Maybe next time we'll get tix to see the entire museum and spend more time. Those are $38 a person. We decided to go ahead and come home instead of spending the night. Our hotel was about a 40 minute drive and home was a little over an hour. Its probably a good thing we came home, all of us slept in this morning including the little one who is normally up with the sunrise. He is still telling us today he had a great time, that's all that counts. XXOO Jen",

They do appreciate you even if its not being shown right now. Oh and as for the tree.... my son's 1st cmas. We put up the tree with lights and 1 ornament. I never got back around to decorating the rest of it and you know, it wasn't a big deal. He was excited with the lights and I didn't have to worry about him pulling the ornaments off. Past 2 years we really didn't have a tree up at all. Teeny house and a cat who chews on everything. Its what you feel inside that matters the most. :O) As for me I had another visit with my surgeon yesterday. Looks like I will be spending 3 days in the hospital. HOPEFULLY to be let out on cmas eve. So my brain has been trying to figure out what to pack and take with me for those 3 days. Wishing I hadn't sold my laptop recently now, oh well she needed it for school. I'm nervous about it and dreading those dang drains but I can't wait to be more whole again. My boss and his wife (my gf) called yesterday and asked if they could bring us cmas dinner. That really made me feel good. So they are going to pick up a honeybaked ham and all the trimmings and have dinner with us. My gf can have a hard edge to her most of the time, and its nice to see the softer side. My mom is taking ryan from the 19th thru to cmas eve to give dave a break on taking care of both of us. I don't ask for prayers very much but those of you who do believe and pray, I could use a few voices about the surgery. :O) Have a wonderful weekend ladies!!!!!",

The area is just raw meat. Hubs helped me sorta get cleaned up and we headed for the doc. he looked at the spot and told me that I had popped an internal stitch but cannot do anything about it at this moment, I have to heal a bit more before that can be done. He did however give me some sauve to go on it, and oh man does it work awesome! I got my last drain out and by last nite I popped another leak. He said eventually they will go away nothing to worry about. Everything else looks ok, I have a few slow healing spots. Got out some staples and a few stitches. Hubby said he tried to put on his best \"I'm pissed face\" to get the answers out of the doc. And hubs is good at those lol. Doc was teaching another intern at the time so there was more explinations going on. My leaks were soaking thru 3 taped together overnite maxi pads to I sent hubs to store for newborn diapers... they work pretty good.

When I get them I take potassium supplements for a few days and they stop. I learned that from my low carb days. I hope you 2 get some relief from them soon. I was reading today about a new boob process where they suck out fat in other areas and use that to enhance your bustline....I'm hoping that once I get around to getting up the nerve to go under the knife again it is perfected and I can do that instead of fake ones. s/s XXOO",

Thought of you alot yesterday, sending bday wishes and hoping you had your prius checked out. Kerry~ my hubby has learned alot about pads here lately as well. Except I've been using them as gauze pads cause they are cheaper. I went thru 3 huge packages of pads and 2 packages of diapers in the past month from this surgery. I'm ready to go pad free for awhile. Had doc appt today and got my stitches out YAAAAAYYYYY! That feels a little nicer. I don't have to go back for 3 weeks and see him. Now I just get to finish healing up without being poked on. I actually got a real bra on this morning, it doesn't feel too bad so far. Of course its one of my mastectomy bras. I'm not going out and buying any new ones for awhile.... waist of money in my mind for me. I've also been released to be normal again. After 7 weeks I'm excited. I'm going to try and get my house all cleaned up this weekend, hopefully with some help. Hubby is going to move back into our bedroom again tonight, not sure how happy I am about that. Don't get me wrong... love my hunny, but I have had a queen size bed to myself for 7 weeks. He and my 8 yr old have been sharing a twin size bed this whole time. Everytime I have surgery hubby moves out cause he is afraid of rolling over and hurting me at nite. I'm looking forward to getting back to normal. :OD",

It gives me time to figure things out. Today I am heading out to pick up some frozen meals for the next few weeks. Trying to make things a tad bit easier on my hubby best I can. Then tomorrow is clean the house up real nice so that part is done as well. Ya who am I kidding? I've been trying to clean this house up since taxol ended.

I'm still trying to force more fluids than I normally drink. I have alot of swelling in my arms and legs. Started to wear my nighttime lymphodema sleeve at night cause that arm was starting to ache. And you know the best part about all this right now..... I can't reach my own butt. Not to wash or to wipe. Hubby is so thrilled about this one. I'm hoping that things will start to loosen up a bit soon. fun fun fun. I'll still be walking at an angle for awhile. Not because of pain but it gives the skin time to stretch to its new spot. He told me up to 3 weeks if need be. Also started in taking 1 percoset and 3 motrins every 6 hours. Doc said I could mix mortin or advil with the other as long as I didnt go over 1200mg a day. Seems to be helping out alot right now. Robin~ After your surgery and they get you set up in your room, ask for a pillow for each arm as well. That makes it a bit more comfy sleeping and such. The nurses were real good about \"tucking me in\" with mine. The one thing that is bugging me the most about this ordeal..... All the other surgeries I have gone thru I snapped back my faster than the docs expected.....It doesn't seem to be happening this time around. Hubby says its because it is a much more major deal I am going thru, probably so but dang it I like to be at the top of my class LOL. :O)",

On the plus side I do have a real sports bra on now instead of the \"paper thing\" they give you at the hospital to wear. One wash and it started falling apart.

I've thought more than once about asking about having a booth for local festivals. But it is to dream of good smelling things. Not a whole lot happening here. Saw my ps last week for the last time for 2 months. Any little break is a happy one. When I go back to see him it will be to set up my nipple tweeking. My trammy side is larger than the real side but it turned out to be a good thing. When I had all those problems and had to get things resewn, I had dead areas that had to be cut out. Things happen for a reason, whether we see them or not. I'm still trying to find comfy ways to sleep. I'm normally a tummy sleeper and without a boob there it was perfect.... now there is one in the way LOL. One thing I am having issues with.. like robin regular pants are not fitting right and if I wear jeans more than a day or two, my scar is raw. Plus I am CONSTANTLY pulling my pants back up. Not having a waist at the moment to keep them at the right spot sucks. I'm going to try and find low riding jeans and see if that helps...... or a pair of rainbow suspenders. One \"fun\" thing I am also dealing with... my family is notorious for not dissolving internal stitches. Right now they are working out and all sorts of spots. I had what looked like a huge pimple come up right on my scar line on my trammy boob. Of course I had to keep poking at it. Got a closer look and saw it was a stitch working its way out. So I dug out a pair of tweezers and helped it a tad. By the time it got to a point where it was tugging internally, it was about 3 inches long. Fun fun Had my very first haircut last week as well. Told the guy I was trying to grow it back out long again so he just shaped it up and evened me out. He started to comment on my \"last haircut\" being all wonky and uneven. Had to explain it was a hairgrow not a haircut. It was funny, got a good laugh out of it. It looks better now evened out. Hated to cut it, but I was started to look like a wild woman no matter how much I tried to tame it. Otter~ I also started to get that plate for my car. It was out of my budget. Maybe next time around. Is there any memory vitamins that we can take?? Non-estrogen related ones? I really need help in the brain fry area. All my love and good wishes for a fabulous week. :O)",

Have a great trip this weekend as well :O) I checked in with my onc about the supplements while on herceptin and tamox. He said I could have anything I want unless it was estrogen based. So the biotin and QC10 are in the clear to take. Been feeling very mood swingy this week. I'm sure it has something to do with the tamox. I'm trying to keep it under control at the moment and not get bent out of shape when something is said to me (that can be taken wrong). Hot flashes have gotten worse... not horrible just a PITA. Wasn't having them during the day until taking this pill. 1 week down 4 years and 51 weeks to go. Locally they are advertising for a grocery store and BC awareness month on the radio. This week's ad, they so perkily annouce has \"pictures of REAL bc survivors\" on the pages. What kind of messed up world are we in that we need to be paraded around like frickin circus animals, have our pics posted, just so a store can make more money off of us?!?!?!? Granted some of the items they are selling gives money to research but overall they are in to make an extra buck. Everytime I hear the perky little voice talking about the pics in the ad, I want to rip the radio from the wall and smash it to smithereens. Sorry, told you I was a bit moody. On the good side.... saw my LD therapist yesterday. I guess my arm is back to normal size this week. WOOOHOOOO! It's had several swelled spots since the week I started taxol. I am hoping this is the end of that mess. I'm sure I will have days in there, but this is a good start. happy thursday :oS",

Cmas cookies are the one thing I look forward to each year. Had my doc visit today. He just poked around my surgical area and asked if I was having any pains. Said I looked really good and asked when my last mammo was.... told him it was scheduled at 11am today. I go back and see him in 3 months for an ultrasound on the scar area and then maybe not again for 6 months. Cruised over to my mammo and it was written down as an ultrasound not a mammo, which is what the doc wanted me to get. They called his office and nobody answered quick enough so I ended up having both done. Not a big deal for me... I just ended up slimey and squished. The girl who did the squishing was extra careful of my port, which I was VERY grateful for. Now I just have my echocardiogram on wednesday and I am done for the week. They offer a MUGA for my testing as well but I opted for the echo.... no needles. No up periscope for me for awhile hopefully. I guess there is a benefit of being the baby of the group lol.",

Boss decided to treat me and is getting me a 27 inch flat screen monitor for work! I'm going to have to sit on the other side of the room to work with it lol. I tried to con him into letting me have 2 smaller ones on each side of the big one so when I work it would be like an imax theater.... my desk isn't big enough dang it lol. My thoughts are with each of you ladies. Warm squishie hugs and lots of love! Jen",

I'm trying to work out the swelling I get from each herceptin treatment, yet again. I swell up pretty good each time and it goes down a bit each day. This time around I swelled good enough that my scar from the nodes was hurting pretty good. Looks like I had a bit of hair growth spurt, longer but still not filling in all the way. I'm tempted to slap some mousse on it to make it lay down at least. Standing straight up. I did go thru and start digging out all my fancy hair products that have been in the back of the closet for months. I'm a hair product junkie to say the least. Fingernails are looking better each day. They have about 1/8 of an inch to look completely normal. Think I might be able to start going without polish now and not be so self aware. OH, I went nekkid at red lobster for hub's bday! I wore my hat in but once we sat down I took it off..... its a start. :O) hugs and slobbers!",

      "Content": "Jan 15, 2009 11:36PM Sable wrote: Here is my story...... Last february I started having severe pain at the top of my left breast and kinda felt a hard spot. I did some research and found out that caffiene will cause this to happen. I had been drinking that new pepsi max daily for a bit and chaulked it up to that. I stopped with the caffiene and the pain went away and the bump went down in size. A month later it swelled a bit more and was hurting again so I made an appt with the gyn. Had my exam and she said it was most likely nothing and was probably the caffiene as well. She sent me for a mammo, who said it looked like a cyst and should probably get it out. They sent me to a surgeon who also said it was most likely a cyst but he wanted to get a biopsy on it \"Would I like to have one done right then and there?\". Nothing like a surprise biopsy. He called me back 3 days later with the bad news and highly suggested a mastectomy but it was my choice. Turns out it was a good choice. I had 2 large lumps and a smaller one that had not been detected. My cancerversary is march 11th. Today.... Had my herceptin. Normally I get stuck by 1 of 2 ladies and that is it because of all the problems with my port. Today while waiting to see the doc, they took my blood pressure etc and the lady says I'll send somebody in to access your port. I didn't think anything of it and expected to see my nurse lisa come thru the door. They sent in a totally different lady I've not worked with before. The scared me a bit and told her she had one poke chance and if she missed she had to send in lisa. Hubby said I was mean sounding when I said it so I had to apologize later, I had guilt lol. She got me set up in one poke YAY! and away I went to the infusion room. Lisa looks up and sees me and starts to head over, then sees I am hooked up. We talk for a few minutes and she goes back to work. Once I was all done for the day she catches us and was quite upset she didn't get me today. I guess she got onto the other lady and said that I belong to her. It made me feel good. She is like my guardian angel throughout this whole ordeal. Gonna have to get her something special on my last day, maybe I'll take her in flowers that day. Also got a new script for a different anti-depress today. This one is only $9 a month. Why they didn't give me that one to start with I'll never know. I pray that it cuts these hot flashes to a minimum and I might start to feel normal again. OH! something else..... got my results from my tumour marker test from last visit ... I am well within the \"normal\" range. WOOOHOOO! I can't remember the exact number, all I can recall is hearing \"according to your blood you are cancer free\". That's all I need :O)",

Hubs made me a big flower bed out front 2 years ago. the first year it was so pretty and last year was horrible. My mom tried to help with it but it just wasn't the same. I keep peeking out the back window hoping to see a robin, I know its a tad early though. The first robin is always exciting for me to see each year. I hope each of you has a wonderful day. I love each of you dearly! CHEMOOOOOO for ranD!",

I'm sure it's from all the extra snot in his body. I do the same thing when I get really sick. Then to top things off, hubs came home from work at 10am and went straight to bed and has been there most of the day. I'm avoiding both of them. I dug out my bottle of hand sanitizer and have been using it. love and slobbers, jen.... the bland LOL",

Its a running joke in our house on what shade of orange the light was when my husband cruises thru it. Snowy cold day here in ohio. Supposed to get up to 3 inches of snow, which is nothing in the grand scheme of things. Highs in the lower teens BRR! Debating on which is more important right now.... pay our mortgage bill or buy groceries. I am due a paycheck from work at the moment but the company does not have the money to pay me. It's happened once or twice and other times I get pay checks before I put in the time. I have a few more days to decide  and I'm hoping work comes thru for me with some money. On the brighter side I will be doing taxes tonight, I believe, and doing those electronically. Those usually get deposited within a week after I file them. Burned up my new computer at work the other day. I've only had the darn thing for about 3 weeks. We had it sitting on the floor under the desk in an area made for the comp case. With me sitting right next to the door, I have a small space heater behind me. Boss turns it on before I get there so I don't get cold and I flip it off when I leave. Saturday nite we went over to network the comps together and play games, and my computer kept shutting off. Turns out boss had turned on the heater and bumped it to where it faced directly at my computer box. With it being a hopped up computer to run high end graphics programs it puts out alot of heat anyway, then you add the heater into the mix. Thankfully it only zapped my power supply. I didn't realize just how much heat it put out until the computer was gone to the shop. It probably dropped 10 degrees in my corner easily. Tomorrow is herceptin 5 I think it is.. starting to lose count at this point. Just keeping my eyes on september for when it is all done. I need to figure out if I can get bc.org on my cellphone so I can keep up with you ladies during the day at work. Hubby got me the new samsung behold for cmas, its all touch screen like the iphone. Had to get internet service on it for a month to get my rebate. Personally I'd much rather look at the net on the computer, its like using dialup its so slow on the phone. Ok enough rambling, just felt like I haven't contributed much lately cause I haven't had anything exciting going on. I do check in multiple times a day cause I am addicted to you ladies! lol hugs and slobbers Kristy~ did you get your snail mail from me?",

Then I noticed an older lady was in the middle of the boxes laying across them. She had just got out of the hospital yesterday from having dizzy spells and she was with her husband picking up groceries when she had a bad one. All these people were standing around and kinda gawking. One guy grabbed his phone and called 911. I pushed my way thru and got down next to the lady to see if I could help. She sent me off to get her a 7up to drink and I sent my hubby and son to the veggie section so it wouldn't upset the little one. I came running back with her drink and got in close to her and talked with her. She looks so limp and was sweating pretty good. I stayed with them till the paramedics came along. The guy who made the call also stayed as well. I asked her hubby if he wanted me to stay and he said no and thanks for helping out. He told me the docs couldn't figure out why she was having these spells so bad and he hated to have to leave her at the hospital again. I felt bad for them but I know they were in good hands from there. underarms..... not as thick as before.. I'm ok with that LOL. No feeling on the mast side still except for an occasional twang.

(I'm giggling as I type this) I figured you were probably out and about and that was your home number. There will be many more calls in the future, so no biggie. :O) Otter~ I was kinda leery about the not washing my hair daily thing as well. But using the conditioner on the no shampoo days does make a difference. I can go a max of 2 days though before I have to use the shampoo. Called my mom up yesterday and had her and dad meet us at the international grocery store in cincy (Jungle Jim's). We spent 3 hours walking around and still missed 1/2 of it. Yes there is THAT MUCH stuff to see in this store. Literally....... the produce area alone is an acre in size. There is a website if anyone is curious. When we drive down to see it we plan a full day there. Picked up all sorts of foreign foods and of course lots of hotsauce. The hotter the better for my family lol. And OMG I found jolly rancher soda pop! Haven't tried it yet though. It'll have to wait for earlier in the day, I'm betting it's loaded in sugar lol. Had a really nice time with the parents. It's been 3 months since we saw them so I had ton more hair to look at. Both of them kept rubbing their hands thru the curls. Dad kept saying \"My curly girl is back\". I wish they lived closer. *sigh* They are changing out my meds this week. I was taking a antidepress for the hotflashes and it wasn't working. Gonna try a new one now. This time it's bipolar meds. Maybe I should just carry around a bucket of icewater to dip my head in instead. This sux royally. <squishes> Jen :O)",

I still have to do the kitchen but it can wait a day or so. My kitchen is 12 x 24 and to mop and sweep it kills my back. So its best to do on a day all by itself. Hubs and the kidlet spent all weekend putting together a mini hothouse for their garden. They already started radishes and maybe lettuce next weekend. Hope it turns out ok. I don't think its going to get enough sun where they put it, maybe it will surprise me. I have my 6 month ultrasound tomorrow morning and the follow up with the surgeon next week. One more thing to get past. They started me on the new meds last week, I had mentioned..... And I am also taking 2 flax seed oils as well. So far the hotflashes have been worse. I'm waking up in the morning sticky with sweat now. I'm willing to trade my hotflashes for somebody else's joint pain if you are willing. This really sux. I don't think I can handle this for the next 5 years. I found a neckace at Kohl's dept store yesterday that made me think of all of you. It's a circle with 2009 in the center of it. On the back it is engraved \"never, never, never, never, never give up\" On the box that it comes in it says \"each time you wear this necklace remember all the strength you need is right there inside you and that determination, not destiny, makes all the difference in life.\" If this doesn't describe this group of strong women, I don't know what does. If I had a way to get one for each of you I would... best I can do is show you the webpage for it... http://www.kohls.com/kohlsStore/jewelry/trendjewerly/inspirational/necklacespendants/PRD~452796/Sterling+Silver+2009+Pendant.jsp When I was looking at it, I thought... what a great way to mark the 1 year for this mess. :O) Snow sleet, rain, sun or hail.... I hope each of you have a wonderful week!!!!!!!!! XXOO",

In some cases it is, but I think I am going to look at it another way. They say that 1 out of 8 women will go thru this..... I would like to think that I saved 7 other women from having to go thru it. I've learned to not cry when a needle is in the same room with me and how fast I can run for the bathroom when I am sick.

She will be in the hospital for 3-4 more days and hopefulyl she will be able to go home then. Right now she is still in recovery cause they don't want to move her for a certain amount of time. But this evening she will be in a room. He said if you would like to call her, she won't have the cell phone. But she is at the University of Kentucky hospital in lexington KY.

It's in a prime spot to be smooshed by the front door of the house. And this morning we were treated to 2 baby finches. So I grabbed a big rock out of our flower bed and put it so it blocks the front door from getting to them. My husband's parents are supposed to be coming up tomorrow to look at housing here in town. I didn't want to take a chance to hurting the babies with them not knowing about them. I'm really not looking forward to this visit, his parents are very hard people to deal with. Plus our house is about 1000 sq ft... teeny tiny place. So I get to sleep on the couch for the next few days and hubby is bunking with the kiddo. Anyone want a visitor for a few days? I'll bring my laptop, food and fan. *sigh*",

Not much happening around here, watching the flowers and the trees bloom up a storm. Hub's parents were up over the weekend to look at senior housing. Of course nothing was what they are looking for. They want a 2000+ sq ft house for less than $700 a month. They ain't gonna find that. They don't want to go down in size at all with housing but want to have independent living with everything taken care of. I'm trying to stay out of it best I can. Work is still very slow. Hopefully there is something coming up soon. Right now I have some hours to work, but there is no money in the company to pay me at all. We are owed a few large checks but they haven't been processed yet. I'm ready for all of this to turn around at any point.

So they are doing an exploratory surgery and if it can be cut out then they will do that but if it is more then another surgery to follow. She has been saying for months she would like to have a hysterectomy just so she wouldn't have to deal with her period anymore. I can't make her understand that there is a shitload more than \"just\" going without your monthly. Tried some moose (yes that says moose) in my hair this morning. I still have NO FRICKIN CLUE as to how to style it. I kinda skritch it around with my fingertips when it is wet and hope it looks ok later.

I pretty much got a pat on the head and sent out the door for another 6 months. Uneventful :O) Gotta get back to work, Luv ya'll! Jen",

I tried to come in and read the first evening after my diagnosis but cried so much I couldn't see the screen. I have tried to read some of the information posted on the main site but scared myself bad enough that my husband is going to be my info person. I am 37, married for 10 years and have an almost 7 yr old little boy. The past 3 weeks have been a total blur for me. I started having odd pain and felt a rather large lump right before my last period. I did some reading on the net and came up with I was drinking way too much caffiene so I cut back on that and the lump shrunk a bit and the pain went away. A month went by and the swelled a tad more (had been drinking my caffiene again) and hurt just slightly. So I decided to make an appt with my gyno. She thought also it was a cyst but wanted me to get a mammo and ultrasound. Then I get a call to see a surgeon... a few days later I see him and got a surprise biopsy. A few days after that I got the dreaded call. I've seen the oncologist and had an mri last week. I suspect my surgery will be scheduled at my next surgeon's meeting on next tuesday. I have no doubt in my mind that I will come out with flying colors, however.... it's the between now and then that terrify me the most. I am massively scared of needles and have meltdowns when I have to have blood drawn and then there is the thought of losing my hair. I am scared of the reaction of my husband when it happens and my little boy most of all. My husband has told me many times already that he understands and knows it will come back and loves me no matter what. But how do you explain it to a 7 yr old? The same little boy that everytime you wear it down he finds someway to put his hand in your hair and when he is sick, he wants to lay his face in it for comfort. I know it will come back but it is still scary. I just have to keep my faith and pray to God that all will be well and this will be a fast journey. Jen * With all these hot flashes...
