I have had minor swells here and there over the last almost 2 years but I had had more swelling this last month so I finally went and saw my LE Therapist. Oh yes....spots on my arm are 1-2 inches bigger than my last measurements in October 2011.  So she did the wrap on Wednesday and I went back on Friday and it did go down but not as much as she wanted it to. So we did a different kind of wrap. It was actually painful so I took off all the bandages and it was huge. My hand I can hardly make a fist it is so swollen. So I wore my sleeve for a while let the swelling go down a little. and re-wrapped. I am so depressed. I just want to cry. How can this happen to me. SHIT. I have a 2 1/2 year old son, I work 50+ hours a week and I type all day. Typing with this freaking thing on my arm is super hard to work....I swear if I didnt have my son I would not have any will to live...I just honestly feel like that sometimes. I am glad I can come here and vent...thank you. You gals were so helpful when I had my cellulitis last summer. I knew you all would understand. I want this gone. I see my LE therapist every other day..or that is what we have scheduled for the next 2 weeks. I have been doing my LMD and breathing, opening my neck node and stomach with the breathing.

He said yesterday he wants a PET to confirm the exact nodes in my mediastinum that are metastic. The CT Scan results showed - \"multiple nodules  consistant with adenopathy in the anterior mediastinum and right paratracheal mediastinum\" Under the impression it says - metastatic adenopathy in the mediastinum. New from prior study. I asked him what stage does this make me and he said late IIIC or early IV. I said early IV, really I thought stage IV was stage IV. He said well lets just wait and see what the PET says. I will start treatment on Monday June 4th. He will not say for sure what chemo I am getting until we have the PET results. When we talked after knowing the axilla nodules were all cancer he said A/C then Herceptin. Now he said Taxol and Herceptin. Isnt Taxol kind of a mild chemo? I want to put everything into this. I asked him about Tykerb and or doing the T-DM1. He said he will look into the clinicals to see if I qualify for anything. Sorry to bug you all again. I just want to start treatment.

I know that can help the Emend but uggg. So I take my compazine and Zofran and still do not feel good. Then the bone aches. My legs feel like they are going to fall off. I did get sick this morning. Could of been my empty stomache after working out. Chemo nurse said my hair will probably fall out sooner this time than with TCH. Mine fell out on day 19 before. Got to see my PET scan yesterday. Looks like the cancer is in my muscle tissue, all over my shoulder/arm nodes. I think I counted 8 or more. The report just said several clusters. The mediastinal lymphnodes anterior and paratracheal and of course axilla nodes. Thanks for any tips....is the decadron really necessary??

We did a pump 2x last week and my hand/arm was better right after but then came back the next day or so. My hand is so swollen I can almost not make a fist. So she submitted for a flexi touch and this wednesday the rep from flexitouch is meeting me to show me how it works and see what I think. She said she is pretty sure my insurance will ok it.

She was great, super sweet and we did some different measuring but all in all, no need to drive 40minutes oneway to see her. I did have her feel a lump I found on the outskirts of the axilla area. She said call your onc to be safe. So that started a roller coaster of events. i found another lump, saw onc, he wants them removed. And yes they are on my LE side. Saw the surgeon last Tuesday and he agreed, need to remove them. We actually found another noduel so total of 3. He said he isnt worried to much about the one on the outside of the axilla but the 2 in the axilla area are worrisome but he did say they are a little hard to be lymph nodes. He is a very skilled surgeon and aware of LE and I have all my tools to try and keep things under control. Just need some prayers that this is just scare tissue from my radiation.

We thought it may be a blod clot since it is on my port side. Ultrasound of the neck said no clot, definatley a lymphnode. CT scan showed that in my neck plus it did get a few lymphnodes in the mediastinal area which is where it was last year. This is showing up on a side I have never had cancer. My cancer has always been on my right side. So they cant get me in for a PET until Tuesday along with a biopsy.I would imagine to make sure it is still breast cancer and still ER/PR - and HER2+ So what treatment options are there after Herceptin stops working? What chemo is next. I did Taxotere/carbo and Herceptin the 1st time and then last year the AC and Taxol plus Herceptin. Please give me some treatment optinons that you guys have done.

Pain is in my entire arm.  I an swelling worse too. Can hardly close my hand. I feel ok right now. I have had cellulitis before but it started off small. Not like this. It isnt as red now but still red. I was just in the hospital for a staph infection in February and lost both my implants. I dont want to be in the hospital again.
