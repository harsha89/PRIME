I work night shift in labor and delivery so don't take care of too many \"sick people\". It was very doable and it helped me to feel sane. My coworkers were great and helped me avoid really bad germy situations. Sjenson29, I am glad to see your oncotype came back in the low range. Mine was 21. It is hard to know what to do, isn't it? I am thinking about you.",

Our diagnosis are nearly identical, including an oncotype score of 21. My tumor was grade one, which made it less likely to respond to chemo; however, I opted to do as much as I can to keep this beast away. Chemo was not fun, but not as bad as I expected. I am a nurse and never missed a day of work. I too found the radiation to be more tiring. I never threw up, hair and nails were challenging, but a lot of good tips on how to deal with that here. I now have a poofy little hairdo, completely unlike my old hair, and life is moving on just fine. Keep us updated on your decision.",
