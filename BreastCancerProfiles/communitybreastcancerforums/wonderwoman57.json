In spite of this, several hospital stays, 2 which were a month long each.But..I have made an amazing come back., However ,ealier this week on Monday,Today is Saturday I've discovered an angry red patch the the size of a 50Â¢ piece under right breast. There's no dimpling or inverted nipple on that side. There's no orange peel. Just a couple of tiny marks. It itches very little. When I found it, I googled and discovered IBC might be the culprit.
