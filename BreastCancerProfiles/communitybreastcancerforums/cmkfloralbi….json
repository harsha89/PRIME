At first the plan was surgery, radiationd tamoxifen. However, that is not the case anymore. During the surgery more cancer was found than anticipated. I had the sentinal node biopsy done and not sure of that yet and my cancer hasn't been staged yet but found out that evidently I'm not a candidate for the tamoxifen because my cancer does not have the estrogen receptor sites? So from what I understand that means chemo. I have been given so much information in such a short amount of time I don't know anything anymore. Just when I think I have a good idea of what is going on then I find out I don't. Is that common or I am just freaking out?",
