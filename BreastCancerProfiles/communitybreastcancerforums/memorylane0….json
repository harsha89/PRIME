    "Content": "Apr 11, 2013 08:56AM - edited Apr 11, 2013 08:56AM by memorylane00 I am waiting for results to my excision following a core biopsy. I was told atypical cells were found in the core biopsy and the excision was necessary. So far, I haven't had too much pain in my breast or around the incision. However, I have experienced quite a bit of soreness in my upper abdomen and my tummy seems swollen. I have experienced a bit of wheezing as well, to the point of having to use my asthma inhaler.Â Is this normal, following outpatient surgery?",
