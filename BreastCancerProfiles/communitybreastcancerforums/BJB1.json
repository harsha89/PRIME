BUT I never read beyond this.  Reconstruction seemed so far off.  All I wanted was to know about DCIS and DIEP recon.  Please be sure to read about fat harvesting now.  Knowing the whole story from beginning to end is vital in making the right decisions for yourselves from step one. For me, the decision making was worse than the cancer.  It caused more stress than finding out about the invasion.  But now that most of my decisions are behind me, I am so grateful to have the ability to do research, question my doctors, and count on you for support and education.

What problems does a double lumpectomy cause?  Right now I am very swollen and and a little sore, but nothing that I can't handle.  I am having surgery at Brigham / Dana Farber (Boston) so I am in excellent hands either way. Any and all comments would be appreciated. BJB  Boston",

I alos knew I would be very nauseous.  This time they gave me a patch to wear.  No nausea at all!  In fact, I could have gone out for a big lunch.  The gen anethesia  wore off a couple of hours later, but I never even needed a Tylenol.  Best of luck.
