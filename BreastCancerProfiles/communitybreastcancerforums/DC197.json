No doctor, no matter how experienced, can be absolutely sure that what he feels is nothing to worry about.  Only a biopsy will tell you positively if it's a cyst or a tumor, and whether it's malignant or benign. It's your life, so if you want to find out, I'd advise you to push for a biopsy.  Either way, you will catch an early cancer or put your mind at rest that it's nothing. Best of luck to you Diane",

If you're having a lumpectomy, it's fairly easy and you should be home the same day. The surgeon will explain the sentinal node biopsy that he will perform during surgery to check the lymph nodes.  If the cancer hasn't spread to the lymph nodes, he will not take any more.  I suggest you take someone with you for your appointment with the BS.  Four ears are always better than two when listening for all the facts.  You can also bring a note pad to jot down your questions and his answers.  Come back here with updates and any questions that we can answer for you.

They had said it prevented osteoporosis and was good for the heart.  Studies later showed that long-term use was not good, so I gradually lowered my doseage, but still on it until the bc was discovered.  I did have some aches and pains, but not unmanageable.  But the hot flashes -- they were unbearable, constant and waking up during the night, tearing my clothes off.  I took vitamin E for a while, and it helped a little, but I bought myself a couple of battery-powered fans and actually put one in bed with me at night.  Gradually, the frequency diminished, although I still get them occasionally. I had radiation and it was not horrible for me.  I did develop a red burn towards the end, but the nurses gave me some cooling gel dressings and it got better within a week or so.  It's an individual decision, so you can weigh the pros and cons, but be sure you get all the information from reliable sources - not an 86 yr old.  I'll be thinking of you Tuesday and saying a prayer that everything goes smoothly.

He said there were two rules of thinking on that ... that my first case of shingles would be preventative or that it would not. I opted to get the vaccine because I have witnessed many severe cases of shingles in older family members and friends. Sometimes it comes back with a vengeance! I have seen 2 cases of shingles on the scalp which spread to the area near the eye. I was lucky enough to get vaccinated before my BC diagnosis, but everyone should ask their onc if it is advisable for them to get it. By the way, I also get a flu shot every year with no side effects (and no flu!)",

I thought it would be smooth sailing.  Imagine my shock when the BS called and said that the lump was a little bigger than he had thought, and cancer was in 12/25 nodes.  When I met with the MO, she said my treatment would be aggressive, but first she arranged for me to have an echo, bone scan, and Ct scan. Ok, I thought, I'd better prepare myself for what lies ahead.  So when I found BCO, I read all the things that I should buy in preparation for chemo.  And then I shopped for a wig.  The MO called and said there were conflicting findings on the 2 scans, so she ordered an MRI, and set up a follow-up appt with her to receive my results.  By this time, it was the week after Christmas, so I had already asked that chemo treatments not start until that following Mon.  When I met with the MO on the Fri. before, she told me a met had been found on my spine, and that I would not be receiving chemo afterall. So, instead, I was given a script for anastrozole, and an appt for a Zometa infusion.  So, here I am today, feeling totally blessed that I have had 2 years pain-free, with very little side effects (only minor aches and hot flashes), and almost in denial that I am stage IV. Of course, I am never completely in denial, because it's a reality. I count every day as a blessing, trying not to squander this precious thing called LIFE! I also feel blessed that I can come to these boards and read the wisdom of so many sisters that have traveled this road.  At some point, far in the future, I hope, if the AIs aren't working and there is progression, I know I can come here and there will be someone to help me through it.

I haven't had any chemo, but if the hormone treatment eventually stops working, I will try it if the side effects are tolerable. There are many of us Stage IVers on this board who live pretty normal lives, so try not to panic about this dx. (((hugs))) Diane",

I am by no means an expert, but in answer to you question, I would schedule an appt. with a breast specialist.  Regardless of the findings of the biopsy, whether it is benign or not, I would think it prudent to have it removed, due to your family history. There is no definitive answer from a biopsy. The only complete findings are from the pathology after the lump has been removed. Good luck to you and come back here to let us know how you are doing.  (((Hugs))) Diane",

I am so sorry that you got that diagnosis, but the doctor had no compassion to tell you that in those terms.  No one has an expiration date stamped on them.  So far, they haven't found a cure for us stage IVs, but there is always hope that research will find one soon.  As has been said by others, there are many treatments that can keep us going for years.  A \"sister\" on these boards recently passed after living for 14 years with stage IV. Do not give up hope! Your children only need to know that you will be taking some medicines to help you control your illness.  I would not mention anything beyond that, because they won't want to let you out of their sight for fear that you won't return. Just try to live your life as normally as possible and enjoy the beauty of each day.  Worrying won't change the diagnosis .. it will only add stress to your life. Check out the stage IV forum and you will get a lot of helpful information from the beautiful and knowledgeable ladies there.  You will hear how many have been surviving despite progression, cheer when there is regression, and sometimes get a laugh or two. I wish you many happy, enjoyable days and years on your journey. (((Hugs))) Diane",

If you decide to follow up with a biopsy, it really isn't very risky.  They numb the area and take a sample with a needle.  You don't feel anything except the initial prick when they numb it.  Good luck to you and let us know the outcome.

It is true, there is no cure for BC, but many women who are dx at an early stage and get the appropriate treatment do go on to live a long and healthy life without recurrence. My focus is to give hope and advice to help those newly dx to get through treatment. As time goes on, and they are a little more comfortable in this journey, they will understand the realities that many of us face.

With all the other stress in you life right now, relax and enjoy your vacation.  The statistics show that 80-85% of all biopsies are B9, so the odds are in your favor anyway. (((hugs))) Diane",

You will also learn a lot from those that have walked the path before you. I read your other post and saw that you just turned 34.  Happy Birthday, although I don't think you were expecting bc as a gift.  My dx 2 years ago was very much like yours, except that I am older ... actually old enough to be your mother!  My one bone met was to my spine, and radiation zapped that away. Mets to the bone are treated like a chronic condition, and many bone-metsters on these boards have lived many years.  We are all just hanging around until research comes up with a complete cure, so don't loose hope. You may want to check out the Stage IV board where you'll find a lot of support. (((hugs))) Diane",

And please don't use Dr. Google to find information, he will only scare the hell out of you.  The women on this forum have been through this and will tell it like it is.   Whatever the pathology shows, you are treatable!  As you can see from my signature, I am stage IV and coming up on my 2 year cancerversary and still feel well.  No one has an expiration date stamped on them.  I hope yours has not spread beyond the lymph nodes (the lymph nodes were doing what they're supposed to do - keep the cancer cells in check).  But these days, breast cancer is treated more like a chronic disease.  We just live with it while the research continues to look for a cure. So, here your cancer sisters will hold your hand, give you hugs, comfort you on bad days, and celebrate with you on the good days.  Be kind to yourself ... I know the waiting is tough.

My name is Diane, and I was first dx with bc in Sept, 2010. I was originally thought to be early stage, but after surgery with lymph node dissection and an MRI which found a lesion on my spine, I became stage IV de novo. It's funny, 7 years ago I wouldn't even know these terms to describe my disease! So, after surgery and radiation, I took anastrozole and zometa for 5 years without much change to my quality of life. I always knew in my heart, though, that I never wanted to have chemo and go through the horrifying treatments that I personally saw many family members and friends go through. I know that I am a bit of an anomaly, and even my oncologist admits that he doesn't have any patients like me. In the Fall of 2015, I had a PETCT scan, and, although I wasn't having any pain, cancer had found it's way to many bones in my body and was making a meal of those bones. The biggest concern was the femur in my left leg, so I had the surgery to insert a rod in that leg. My onc advised that my meds had to change, and prescribed Ibrance and letrozole. The Ibrance was at the highest dosage, and I experienced almost all the side effects listed. I was ready to give up entirely, but he changed to a lower dosage that I was able to tolerate. That worked (I thought) for about 14 months when I had the last PET/CT. My intuition told me that something was amiss, but I wasn't prepared when he told me that it was now in my liver. That's it for tonight ... gotta get some sleep ... I've enjoyed reading all your posts and \"meeting\" all of you. Diane",
