I was terrifeid , angry, in denial....you name it, with the help of the wonderful girls here my journey would have been so much harder. I finished Chemo last May after a mstectomy and all my nodes out. You will get through this I promise you, take each step as it comes..it is not easy but to get that thing out of my body was immense relief. Looking back I was very unwell and didnt know why... this is where you are starting out and you will feel better. Do not as the sisters have said read too much, I have learned that everyone reacts differently to all the tx.  You will come out the other side and back to normality, I never thought I would, I was so so angry ...thats what we are here for .... you come here at any time.... we will be here to see you through your journey . I had a grade 3 and I was trip neg... it meant a lot at the time... but as time has passed... I do not dwell much on that.bcos the thing has gone and as far as I am concerned I know I did everything I possibly could. You are in my thoughts , I wish I could sit with you and chat... you just have to really know YOU WILL DO THIS .... xxx You have also found the best support group ... it will be an asset to your every step. I know you dont want to be here, you dont want the dx.... I was there 2 years ago. Since then I have become well got a full head of hair... and made many many loving friends along the way xxx  I also worked full time througout everything , for me this was a godsend. ",

Tonights conversation was very bad much worse than I am trying to put across. Do I have a right to be upset with how ill he is and would you be upset if you hadnt been given the full details ...

I was walking along and tripped/slipped over a metal cage around a small tree. I flew up in the air and heard a loud SNAP! As I landed I knew it was deadly serious. I have never shouted help so loud in all my life ! It was dark and a lay on the wet floor for over an hour my hand dared not move from supporting that leg as I felt the bone cut into the skin, my other arm was pinned underneath me and was getting very sore and numb. The ambulance arrived and the had to give me gas and air for the pain ,while they cut my trousers open, on doing this all the people stood round gasped. My ankle was the wrong way and the leg was the other. To cut a long story short I was operated on and a rod is now in place. I had neveer felt so much horrific pain as they xrayed it and realigned it before hand. I have broke the tibia and fibia. I have a wheel chair a zimmer a commode and everything is supplied by the hospital. I do not know how it will heal.... but I hope it is quick. I have been told no weight bearing for 6 weeks ARGHHHH So thats it.... what a mess I made again LOL Hope you are all well xxx ",

      "Content": "Aug 8, 2010 04:36PM - edited Aug 8, 2010 04:37PM by sueps Judie xxxxxxxxxxxx This is the mail I just sent my dad .... great minds think alike.... this is what I am feeling.. Hi Dad Sorry to mail again. The test results for this BRCA1 well they have sunk in now and although I am coping I feel really ripped up inside. I thought I would be OKish, why does nothing ever hit me until days/weeks after. This is what I am worried about : the genetist who I saw said ... I have a 60% chance of getting ovarian cancer and 90 % chance of getting another breast cancer. Well statistics dont matter too much, but I do have to take into account for the sake of myself and everyone. She went on to say \" if you have your ovaries out, it will lower your chances of getting breast cancer again\" now this ISNT the case with me, if my breast cancer was not growing from hormones then how can having my ovaries out protect me from another hormone negative breast cancer. I AM GOING TO SEEK AN ANSWER TO THIS. So given what I know and knowing that I want to avoid at all costs another breast cancer AND chemo AND risk then I am now leaning heavily to having another mastectomy. I know I cant live with the thought of anything occuring but I can live with the pain and the relief of removing almost all the risk. Its just having the courage to go ahead and do it. Ok so this is what I need to do I think. So right now , I am worried about , the blood test result , the testing of my ovaries when they are removed , but more than anything I am worried about this hip pain. UGGGH. So why am I emailing . Well , I don't want to talk about it because it is fedding me up to the back teeth. And I need to let you know where I am up to in my head, because you will never know if right now I dont want to talk about it. So , I get a blood test on Friday , go on holiday pretty much soon after (going to book somewhere tomorrow) come back , get blood test results , and actually of they come back ok , then my hip pain worry will reduce dramatically. Depending on whether when I have rested my hip pain goes or not the doctor wants to send me for a bone scan IF IT IS STILL THERE. It is not a painful hip pain , it is a squeezystabby deep pain. This is where I am up to on this in my head. Back to square one. With time and that I may feel better I am sure. Will speak before I go away.",

I am so pleased your ultrasound went well...xxx That is such great news....When do you start getting your Autumn in Australia....Do you get really cold Winters xxx Well I am so happy to read all these posts and know what you are all up to...Karen are you binge eating tonight ...I have just about stopped this time around...Its such a false appetite isnt it!! Mind you I would welcome that appetite in reality...I am not very good at looking after myself if my o/h isnt here...I just eat lazily xxx I have been mostly working all day again....I found out the new bosses have put an advert in the evening news asking for managers and deputy managers in their Bolton Stores .......... ...... they probably just looking for one to replace Toms other shop....OMG ....I might be jobless in February..... I am sure it is against the law...I have been reading up!!!    I am really under immense stress at the thought ..... OK I wont thought xxx I have a cold coming too...and I have conjunctivitus...grrrr maybe I am a bit rundown.... the weather is cold and then perculiarly mild for this time of year...it feels so strange .. Zippy is on the other chair sulking tonight...my O/H is on nites this week and if I go and lie on my bed then I might get a burglar in down stairs ...LOL....I had a serious and callous break in a few years ago at another house so maybe its a phobia feeling....as I was in the house in bed at the time and disturbed them....they got away with lots and were never caught  ...They took hundreds of pounds worth of jewellery etc but what really made me cry was they took a camera that needed developing...with Davids last nativity play at infant school   I have the most saddest feeling ever ...I wonder where it ended up... Ok I am going to shove loads of ointment in my eye and blind myself after I have made a brew.... I need a holiday!!! I do some mystery shopping for a few companies in my spare time....it pays well for what its worth...I am supposed to be doing 2 banks during work tomorrow...but I am way too weak and my memory is too bad...last time I did one I had to stare long and hard at her name badge...lol...her hair kept covering it...I am sure she guessed I was evaling her...got back to my car and couldnt remember a thing ! ...Oh my...I really could do with a break...xxx Be good sisters....

Now I could phone the helpline...but they would send me to the out of hours docs which is a 20 min drive.... too tired...I already knocked my car up on the way home from work tonight. So here is what I will do... I will see if the s/e get any better tomorrow...and try and hold on til Thursday....or Weds...when I will go to see my own gp and see if I can get anything...  As for the next treatment...OH MY GOD.... I scream inside at the thought....I am no wuss to pain or anything ...but this is beyond what my head can get through...I know you all understand ... so next treatment I am going to go haywire and tell them ... this has been absolutely the week from hell ... I am concerned about the bleeding  etc.... So what else to add to this.... one of my colleagues at work was off sick from work on Saturday.... her aunty died. Well it turns out her aunty was 39 and got dx with b/c 2 years ago... had surgery chemo rads ...only for it to come back....WHAT A THING TO PASS MY EARS RIGHT AT THIS BAD TIME I AM HAVING.  I drove home tonight looking into the hills...in quietness and asked who was taking the p*ss  bootface ...it was like a dagger at dawn feeling...and the clouds were grey and my mood was like ughhhh well.. very in the desolate mountain feeling... I am sorry I am so ill xxx",

Met my surgeon again and he has arranged a bone scan for 1st OCT because of the pain in my collar bone...I have to have a dye injection and wait 2 hours for the scan...  how will I sit still and be patient. I asked him how painful my arm would be post op as its my right one and I need it to slam about with at work...he said some people have no probs...just have to wait and see....  I really want and need to get back to work asap .... do you think I will be OK after 3 weeks or so or maybe 2..or am I pushing it...today I am feeling inconvenienced. The pain is terrible the lump keeps slyly pinching me and I have been telling it to do one all day long  I have also the fear factor of the mastectomy today...and also its all so unreal...please any enlightment on my thoughts always much appreciated... love to all ...on a cold rainy night xxxxx across the dark ocean ..... gosh I love to travel .... why oh why",

I dont mean I just feel down with no breast but the scar is an outward sign of how ill I was...inwardly ...well I never liked to stop and look inward for any length of time...so maybe it is hitting home...as the last time I really really had grounded thoughts about anything was when I was healthy with both breasts..the scar will make me come to terms I guess and I will no doubt wrangle some more...until acceptance comes...I have difficulty accepting things ... Sorry ... I am sure it is normal...I hope...The human mind is powerful eh... Anyway off to make a nice cup of tea x",

I know what you mean about the pain issue...the fact of why we have surgery pales into significance for that stage....but honestly you will feel relief when you come round...and yes the pain is there BUT they give you loads of pain relief...they gave it by a drip and by a syringe in my mouth....I had to have loads of anti nausea meds though as the morphine..whoooosh that is strong stuff..... I was mainly concerned with the rubbish aftermath pain when I got home...and it happened on about day 5 .....so I went out of hours and got some TRAMADOL....ask for this when you leave hosp...it is FAR better than co codamol etc....made me feel relief ...and also relieves your head for a while.... I know your op is much bigger than mine...but the key to it is the pain meds....I will be thinking so much of you nxt week....I just shut my eyes in my head and thought sink or swim...and I managed to swim....and look I am back to work..... It is the most nastiest experience (not the op but the overall thing) but what can we do....we have to carry on and always have an image of our boys in our heads...bcos that really helped ....... You're nurse telling you that LOL....YOU WILL DO FINE ..... you really really will xxxx Sheila....xx  Good luck tomorrow...I will be thinking of you....and looking forward to when you are recovering and back in touch with us all .....

Please let me know....I have my hair tied up most of the time ..... would this make a difference...would people be able to tell..... and I so don't want to be ill....I am almost crying with frustration..I feel like shouting my lil head off.....

Firstly Poppy...I am so glad you posted..I was going to PM you tonight and wish you all the bestest....This time nxt week you will be on the otherside of surgery....I had my surgery at the end of my period....and I managed to be ok.....I did tell the nurse...they were fine...I am sending you loads of wishes and a great big hug.....I can't wait to see you up and well...and remember whilst you're in hospital we will all be thinking of you and waiting for your return (in your own time of course xx) xxxxxx ( I had my own room...my OH stayed loads and helped me a lot...see if you can do this...I might have been lucky) Well let me enlighten you on today and thankyou for all your wonderful support...I would just have crumbled solitary without you all xxx Well Mr Welsh told me all about my disease...he called it disease....he gave me all the stats as they do ... which I can neither take in or rely on...if I did I would put myself in the negative ratio...so forget that...one day at a time.... He said the tumor had deep margins .... whatever that means I have no idea....but I will have radiation after chemo as it was very close to the chest wall... So here is the plan! (if I decide to do it) 12 weeks ...every 3 weeks I will have epirubicin 16 weeks....2 weeks on and 2weeks off...CMF (3 drugs) So thats 8 cycles in all...I did not think I would have the latter treatment so close together! How will I recover from the first lot before the second lot...and anyway I have just read again it doesnt look like 8 cycles because I have to go a total of 12 times... I have a headache thinking about it ... Christies the hospital is going to give me a call in the next couple of days to see if I have made my mind up....and book me in for next week...... I am not sure as to what to do...what ifs' and maybes'...how cruel if I haven't got it...if the treatment doesn't work ..... if it comes back.....see this is why I had a bad day in my head.... All I feel is a chill in my heart....cold cold situation... Well I am going to have a cup of caffeine and try claw back...and get my head back together....

Yday I went to the chemist to discover they couldnt get hold of my anti ds so I googled to see if it was a permanent problem... I didnt get that far a I found out that anti ds can cause WEIGHT GAIN, I have never given them much thought since the doc prescribed them nearly 2 years ago when I discovered BOIL IN THE DIRTYRIDDEN BAG BOOTFACE....and now realise that I dont really need them ??????????????? So I am breaking ea tablet up and taking 10 mg a day.....what do you think ???????/ I read it is hard to come off thing like these.... can anyone give any input .... I feel kind of sad lately and  can feel  a black hole ... but I am happy @ the same time.... very difficult to describe... I also read the tabs cause bone pain and bad dreams ... I now wonder if it is these rather than the chemo.... WHAT TO DO...,. Can anyone please advise better ... I mean of any experiences....

Anyways my new boss owns a zillion million Subways she is called Deirdre Anderson...she used to live in Conneticut....and was the operations MD for Subway globally...until she spied a niche in the UK and moved here...opening shop upon shop...I am sure she must own about 50! Her business partner lives in America...xxx I hope I dont lose my job   I am sure there is a law for employees when businesses are transfered.  It wont be the same without Tom ... we were so close x Well Shirlann ...I freaking love your Cleo and your Dusty...I used to have a dog like Dusty called Neville! They are my fav dogs...so placid and funny...so in my next post ...I will get ya pics up in a sec....and then I must try and sleep...I am out of sorts tonight and I dont know what....maybe work stress and chemo rundown and Valsul....I am all mixed up !!

Seriously ...it has been appx 4 months since I was dx .... and I am finding it so difficult ...so much more difficult to live with now ...as everything has levelled out....the fear ... the feeling OLD ...the mutilation....all this and more. Now this is enough for us all to bear....it is more than enough!! So I think when other worries and stresses of life come our way ....like house moves ...family illnesses....normal stress...I think we find it difficult....Let me explain...when I found out Tom had sold up to a large company....I knew and I know my job is going to be a zillion times more stressful....so I worry and I get fed up...to a point...and then I think..whats the point as I may not be around ...and I have been through worse....so then I become all mixed up....well how should I be reacting to things like this....and then I sit on the fence ....and become despondant ....as life goes round without me....Am I making sense.....Same with money....I have always been a saver....and I could save loads right now...but whats the point....What is the point of looking good ...if I have had my breast taken ...do you see all these things.... I need to pick the pieces up .... I need to find a way to look ahead....I dont feel depressed....I just feel LOST. Do I sound silly.... \"sigh\" Maybe its Winter Blues....but seriously....   WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME BOOTFACE ...WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ... !!!!!",

Well one day I was @ work and I told Lauren ohhhh gosh I really have to stay on the till today bcos it hurts too much to stretch, during this day my bad arm felt unusually heavy ...so much so it went through me! So I was ready for my week off work! I fell asleep downstairs for most of the night last Tuesday .. I woke up still feeling a crinkle..BUT I knew it wasnt from sleeping downstairs. So it goes... that day I went to Asda shopping ... came back and fell asleep again.. whence I woke up the pain was so severe ... I couldnt even sit up ... OMG ... I have had my scarf and painkillers ever since. Well my son David has been feeling rubbish .. like I do...and today myo/h has just started with a sore neck..so I just researched it... and VIRUS can cause sore necks.. now I know meningitis can...but this isnt that ... it can be any tyoe of virus.. as toxins are stored in the neck muscles or any muscles... wow I never knew this... which is why after a deep massage you are told to drink plenty of water! So sisters to cut a long waffle short I probably have a VIRUS! Hallelujah... so I am now gonna drink plenty of water ! Sorry for the ranty xxx Hi Lisa, I hope you had fun with your cabin boy!

Christies hospital in Manchester is such a lovely hospital ... but each time I go it brings on sick feeling and I cant help think of it as a chemical factory...blerghhhhh blerghhhhh Anyway I have got neutropenia ...the white blood cells are very low...which goes with the chemo...but they cant tell if they are on the way up or down and have to wait and see if my body will recover. I have also developed severe mucousitits .... inflamation of the mouth throat intestine tract .... for which they are concerned. I have been given morphine to take. They wanted to keep me in but I didnt want to stay, so we compromised...and I promised I would phone them if the inflammation got so bad I couldnt eat. There is nothing they can do but to let mother nature heal.  I asked about next chemo ... they have contacted the oncologist to warn him of the reaction I have had.... and they will look into lowering the dose.....telling me no one can ever judge how one will react to treatment. I had 2 nose bleeds while I was there and they are hoping that in 3 or 4 days my blood clotting will be on the upturn. I am so fed up today girls ... so drained and ill .... I never thought it would be so hard on the body.  I am feeling very sad for all the very sick people I saw today and very very angry with BOOTFACE .... I really want to speak with my oncologist....I just dont know what to do next treatment...and it is making me panic inside....I feel like I am going to have a panic attack Well I am sorry for whinging.... I will try try get my body to buck up xxx Much Love xxx",

Boy I never would be able to explain the kind of pain...I just read some stories that some ladies suffer like this for years....and I mentally fleetingly gave up ...the new pain meds are helping though ...I am going to go into work for an hour to do the bits and bobs for Tom tmw while he is away and then from tmw afternoon until Weds morning I am going to render myself resting....with nice pain meds and lots of sleep... sunneedazee.....you will do good in surgery.I was dreading it...I am always full of fear where that kind of thing lies...but honestly it was OK....and it is only recently I have the pain...If ever I have to face an unwanted episode I close my eyes take a deep breath and think repetively 'its only a moment it will pass' ...... you are so courageous and thoughtful...the hospital will give you all the pain meds you need....don't at all dwell on the pain side...it is not as bad as you care to imagine....I will be thinking of you on the 25th..its also my sons bday....YOU WILL BE IN MY THOUGHTS XX I am having chemo more than likely...I will find out on Weds..I am such a wuss with all this...

'awwwwww mummy' they squealed .... lol...naughty but nice! But the fact that it hasnt spread to my lymph nodes is starting to reassure me.....even though its still a nasty ordeal through and through for everyone...However you have all made me feel much better regardless of whatever I have....

Well I woke up slightly better today...and took 2 strong pain killers..I still have a bit of pain ...not enough to warrant 2 I guess...but I figured they would take the edge off of the scarey head I have on...just until I reach out to my GP tmw.... and it worked as I have been feeling  a bit more positive albeit maybe false...haha... So today I have been shopping for lots of leafy vegetables and pomegrante juice etc..I also bought a hardback note book...because I figure it is best to start a diary of my feelings, my strong and weak days..and what I experience in general as well as health...I am sure to give everyone here a good mention in it as I read back from when I started here.. It will also be good to keep a note of my chemo reactions each time so I can work around it and use it as an aid to get me through the moments...knowing thats all they are...moments... So you see, I am doing the best I can...my head and heart are still brimming with fear.....and frustration...I can also here my pulse and blood race in one of my ears for some reason.. I also called my dad up and brought him up to speed...he is as always a rock to me.... (thankyou dad) xx I do hope you are all ok...and thankyou for reading me  xxxxxx My OH is going back to work tmw... for the first time I will be home alone...I am not too sure I am looking forward to that !

And the 2nd and third is... with the capcitabine. He told me it was the c of the cmf and it would burn my hands but the side effects are possibly slightly less.The doses are every 3 or every 4 weeks....and it is tablet form If I do chemo I will most likely stick with the standard plan, as if I choose to trial I will not be able to choose which trial...... it will be at discretion, and I also dont want my hands to burn .... So the plan is that I will drag myself off to the wig shop tmw....as the NHS give a free wig ....and there will be no commitment still...but at least I will have sorted that...Also the plan is to think ,think and think again.... I will be in menopause for the rest of my life....I just dont understand why they are doing 2 weeks on 2 weeks off. with the cmf...I wont have time to breathe!...but he told me it was a proven method... I am going to do some research  xxx",

I told her I was having chemo next week and she flipped... oh dear ...nothing changes...call it sibling rivalry....I would move heaven and earth for her everytime she has problems....theres nothing sibling on her behalf!   Its all very sad...xxx I have to go to bed within the hour...if I will ever to get up in the morning..I bet I dont fall asleep that early though xxx Do you think Karylls' laptop may have broke ....just cant stop thinking about her xxx",

I am scared witless in all reality and as time passes without the pain easing it is making me angry but only because it is frightening me.... I will tell the docs next Tuesday...but I don't want any biopsy... I am so full of dread... COULD IT BE THE CHEMO OR THE ANTIDEPRESSANTS ...... I just don't know...but there is a sharp aching pain under my arm at times too.... Has anybody had this with chemo or any meds Sorry to whinge..... what to do ...what to do....

I would without doubt find someone with more urgency xxx I found my lump and was diagnosed and had a mastectomy all in the space of six weeks or so. They chose to give me that op because of my age, I did not find out I was triple neg until after surgery , which was when they recommended chemo . I hope this helps. I do agree with all the above, it is imperative that you need to make the right decision and seek a second opinion. If I was offered lumpectomy at the time ...or a choice ...the fear factor would have come into it to start with and I woulod have avoided mast...HOWEVER once my inner self had kicked in I would have shut my eyes and gone with mastectomy.  Please keep coming here for support , I feel you and all the sisters here are absolutely a miracle to me, my life would have undoubtley crippled me if it hadmt been for the love and support here.

She is letting her kids down ....I am not very strong....I can't even begin to explain but I think I am having big reality checks...... the pain is unbearable....emotionally I am floored...Do you know what...I feel like there is something coming between me and the boys .... something nasty that is standing in my way....and I can't reach out to them.... I am wondering if we grieve for the life we once had ...before we got ill...I don't understand why I am feeling huge loss inside myself...I am waffling...and crying ....and the treatment is driving me into right big down times...I am not depressed...just all cut up... Well I will go to the doc tomorrow night and get her to up my anti d's I just feel like I am trapped in a bubble....and its so lonely and scarey... I HATE CHEMO BCOS IT DESTROYS MY HEAD... Will I get to the end .... it is so hard.... I know there are a million ladees that would exchange places with me....and I feel very very selfish for feeling this way...but it is not me...it is the emotional state...it is the fear of things in general...it is knowing that it does come back.... it is the fear of the unknown...  I am trying to face up.... F .E. A.R.  ...FACE EVERYTHING AND RECOVER.... I also need to be living on my own with my boys....I can't handle anything more...too much stress..... makes one ill... Look at me tonight....I really want to pick myself up....but it is too hard.... where have I gone...I can see myself but I can't find myself.. Well I am not gonna have a cuppa cos chemo puts me right off tea...and bootface stupid ugly lechy stinky nasty boil in the bag FILTH has got my head.....see I have tears of ANGER....IMMENSE PURE ANGER... I really want to thank everyone for never ever giving up on me....I am going to try and get a grip ...when I see the wood for the trees... I am going to print all these posts and get them published...I will call it BOOTFACE... I really wish to god we all lived near each other .... Shirlann....the chips in the bag in the UK are called crisps....on our menu board at work they are advertised as chips..the american way...we always have one or two northerns in asking for chips thinking they are going to get a plate of chips...LOL....The customers have been right ANNOYING me today...I want to be a mole with a hole right now...

From a physical side I had pain for appx 3 weeks but I changed the pain meds and got something stronger which helped. Now I am having chemo..it has all happened so fast that I dont actually mourn my breast more than thank god I found it. I do wish I had had my other one off ...it does make me sad...but there is nothing I can do to alter things....so I dont waste energy being cross much ...lol xxx Please hang on...please please let us suppport you ...all your thoughts so close to surgery are so justified...but I want to tell you and assure you from my heart you will feel fine..I was back at work within 3 weeks and out of hospital after 2 days....YOU ARE IN MY THOUGHTS....xxx Having the lymph nodes out was the painful part....mainly down the arm.....I am praying you will be good in this area xxx If I was to be totally honest ...I am still in disbelief....but in all reality I think it is our coping mechanism....bit of denial I think I have....xxx Much Love xxx",

I got to see oncy doctor Welsh today.....hes so nice but very guarded.....I showed him my veins on my arm...and told him I had been quadruple tired...so he has given my double the steroids for 5 days....whoooosh...I will be by midweek...lol....He told me to massage the veins with cream and that they would get better afterwards....and it was the epirubi causing the damage....I only have one of those left.... I asked him if I would die....he told me he hoped I wouldnt and my outlook may even be as good without chemo but no one knows....I WISH I DID!!! So off I went to the chemo suite...I was allowed to carry my own medical notes ...so I spied a long peak....couldnt see much that I already didnt know... next time I will take them and have a cuppa while I study them at the little tearoom ...hahaha Ok I wore my cap today and when the nurse was administering I pulled it down over my face....I have never ever seen the chemo yet...I just turn to the right and rant at the wall ..all the while....its a good job we had waited almost 5 hours as I was actually too tired for a full blown one.....but rant and cry I did...and cry and cry and rant....and then apopgised and then said thankyou ...lol The nurse told me  the cost of chemo is astronomical and it wouldnt exist if it didnt work.....etc etc... oh my I feel like I have been washed and spun.... Please everyone have a snooze for me xxx Much Love xxx",

So they are not too forthcoming with information, and I did as much probing as I could...basically... the cancer is grade 3 .....the staging is borderline 1 to 2 as the tumour was 2cm..they took all my lymph nodes all of only 14 I had LOL.....they were all clear! Basically can anybody enlighten me on this diagnosis especially the grading...???  I forgot to ask whether it was hormone receptive duh...but on Weds 7th November I am meeting with oncologist to discuss treatment...dont know what he might offer but she said with 2cm is borderline for chemo but my being so young might add weight to that...ALSO I may need radiation due to the tumour being very close to chest wall.... Well it is really tiring all this and I still do not know about treatment....the surgeon thinks my recovery is remarkable and her jaw dropped when I told her about work and driving ....she says I am very resillient... Oh well now what...lol...I do not have to go back to breast clinic til nxt year for check up unless I have any concerns....I feel like I have been in a whirlpool for 7 weeks...all chewed up and spat out....  I obviously have no breast for the breast clinic to mammo ...lol Hope everyones ok ....

Would it have been better to be a grade 2 AND say 2 lymphnodes involved or AS IT IS? And Karen...you are amazing,you have been with me throughtout this , while fighting your fire, I am meeting my oncologist 2 weeks today..on 7th Nov (groan more waiting!)

One other thing....obviously I still have the burning pain...back of arm under arm...but also I have great pain in my inner lower arm right down to my wrist ...and cant stretch it fully without sharp pain...I cant understand why...does anyone else have this?

I will have an image of you in my head .... thankyou ! xxx  and Valerie and Melody and everyone ...big hugs xxx Well thanks to everyone for the strength you give me...I have been physically and mentally low since I went to see oncology on Weds...I can't get my head around the nightmare and feel bit rundown...well very...but I think its stressssssssssssssssssssssssss  lo...l  I am cursing so much in my head big time... So I have been to work today ...not my usual perky energetic self to say the least. The hospital phoned me to arrange Tuesdays' treatment...and told me there was no way that I would be able to work...and if it was a question of money they would sort a grant out......and sickness benefit etc....but it won't be enough and I so need to work...I will see how I go ...its only for 6 months... So I go on Tuesday at 1230pm and wont leave until 9pm  .....maybe as its my first appointment.Treatment is always on a Tuesday...and she said the hospital is as busy as Heathrow Airport... Well they will send me away with mouthwash and all the medication etc and give me a helpline number...She told me I wouldnt be able to work and also said I would need radiation after chemo. I had a glimmer of hope that Mr Welsh was retesting the triple neg bit...but she said I scored 0 out of 8 for all the receptors which is a sure sign I wouldnt be having any hormones.... Dragged myself off to the wig shop and placed an order for 2 wigs...which were very nice.. prob pick them up next week... it is the same wigshop my mum used 20 years ago ... Sorry there has been no life in my posts lately ...I am consumed with stress...lol I posted on chemo board so thats good.... get the ball rolling....need to find out more about this menopause for life business....hot flashes an all that....

I went to work today but came home at 4pm...there is a flu type virus going around and I have definitely got it...it is the only time I get really down when I am ill...I feel so rough! and a mess....I do hope it goes before next Tuesday...its not a cold or anything..just sore mouth and weak as anything etc... Well I am still very miserable....I have only just started to really really think of the consequences of this illness and I feel like I have let everyone down terribly. I am also today very sad about the way I look now and that it is for life...my arm aches so much at times and my scar feels raw....so I am not too well at all...I know it has something to do with this virus...I am always the same .... if I didn't feel ill I would have the energy and happiness to fight... at the moment I am flaked out and thanking God so much that I have a day off tomorrow .....which is so out of character!  grrrrrrr I hope you are all 'ok'.....and I so need to keep posting on this board and being with you......I should be back from Manchester on Tuesday evening...I am so frightened...

Well we are like two peas in a pod...and this journey I now find myself on is tearing me apart having to see my dad feel for me so much....and there is nothing he can do to make it all better....it is a comfort to have his unwavering support... I have decided I am grieving for my old me...my care free attitude and my feeling of immortality.....I am grieving my breast also....and though my scar is pretty and very neat I can never really look in a relaxed happy manner...obviously it would sadden anyone of us xxx I am not too sure if the anti depressants are working...I do not feel depressed....just all at sea with anxiety and the like....but maybe thats because of the situation. Before I became ill my life was like a cake cut into several pieces...say 8 ...one for each of my life ways...children... work... worries...health..bills...money...issues etc..... right now I feel that not only is the cake sliced into about 20 thin pieces...not enough to go round...but that somebody has stabbed and sliced it and mixed it all around until it has become a sponge and jam and icing MESS....lol...true...so I am going to have to keep rebaking it every situation....until eventually the slices become healthy to deal with... Well Sueps is off at it again...rambling her thoughts down .... lol...argghhh...I have to say what I see ...lol.. And one more thing...Poppy...if you are out there tonight..I want to let you know that I think you are extremely extremely amazing xxx Your O/H and your children will be really proud of you....

How will I cope when I reach 90 and my body is not in tune with my head! Do you think your mind slows down or will I get frustrated .. ? Notice I said NINETY .. for the first time I have HOPE ... a little flicker ... will turn into a warm glow with every passing day ... Judie you are spot on about my dad... he is a rock and seems he would go on no matter what. However I drove to work with a sad mind this morning... I dont know sisters , these past 12 months I think sad things... and something gnaws at me that there will be a sad time in the not so distant future. They are running tests they find something on his oesophrugus... well I am not sure how you spell it... hes having it done on Friday... he is in Lancaster about 70 miles from me but near his home in the lakes. He went to the toilet on Monday night and produced so much blood that they rushed him in. As you know he suffers from a blood cancer... walthonstrome... I am not sure how you spell it... it is not curable but treatable with chemo on and off... but the docs have to be careful with chemo as he had a triple by pass a bout 15 years ago... so they tend to give his blood a boost. Ok I am just going to think for a while Much love... xxxx ",

His o/h phoned me the Tuesday night 3 days after he went in, and told me \" he had been to the toilet and lost some blood\" nothing else but that he was having tests. Of course the following morning I drove to wrok with a heavy heart, I even came on here to comment on my strange sad feeling. So I phoned the following night to her and she was like well they need to run this test on Friday, he is ok he shouldnt really be in he just wants to go home blah blah blah.. I was still feeling sad and cried a lil but she didnt say much else 'cept for she would call me if anything else went on. I send my dad a card to the hospital. He phoned me on the Friday after he came out and left a voicemail saying he just wanted to rest etc. I call him today and leave a message and he calls back tonight. ",

I wish I had never gone now, my friend Andy who manages a Subway down the road from me asked me to go a few weeks ago as his mum had just passed away, so I went with him. I am worried that she was so good to get so many things right in such a personal way.HOWEVER I am so scared that she anticipated hospital visits , inheritance regarding a one level house. My dad is 70 this year and really unwell with blood cancer... he lives in a bungalow ... am I wrong to feel this worried.. if the onelevel house hadnt been mentioned I would be better.

      "Content": "Jun 7, 2009 05:35PM - edited Jun 7, 2009 05:37PM by sueps Hi My gorgeous sisters xxx  I am popping in to update you on stuff going on.  I went to the hospital last Wedsnesday for genetic testing. They are going to confirm all that I told them about my mum and gran having ovarian and breast cancer and then they are going to start the test. The test in on the NHS , I think a sister asked if I had to pay for it.  They think it is almost likely I will have brac 1 and possibly 2 faulty genes, they said it was very unusual to get b/c so young, and have a history like my mum and gran. Being triple negative makes it even more likely. The test may take a week or it could take 12 months it depends on the cells activity and growth in the lab, If I do have the gene there is  a 60% risk of getting breast cancer in the other breast note: my gran and bilateral breast cancer in her 40s. If I do have the gene I will be having my ovareis and fallopian tubes out as this will decrease the risk of getting b/c EVEN if it was triple negative... so hormones dont necessarily come into it. I came away from the hospital very sad. I am still on half dosage anti ds and they are affecting me  but I am determining to come off them. The other important thing to note is that if anyone does have the faulty gene it tends to start havoc in the thirties . Ok sorry to talk bootface again but I wanted you all to know what was going on... xxxxxxxxxxx ",

His o/h phoned me the Tuesday night 3 days after he went in, and told me \" he had been to the toilet and lost some blood\" nothing else but that he was having tests. Of course the following morning I drove to wrok with a heavy heart, I even came on here to comment on my strange sad feeling. So I phoned the following night to her and she was like well they need to run this test on Friday, he is ok he shouldnt really be in he just wants to go home blah blah blah.. I was still feeling sad and cried a lil but she didnt say much else 'cept for she would call me if anything else went on. I send my dad a card to the hospital. He phoned me on the Friday after he came out and left a voicemail saying he just wanted to rest etc. I call him today and leave a message and he calls back tonight. ",

I am feeling better in that respect, and quite horrified at the way I just went downhill, I think I am in shock! Anyway I have a raging raging kidney infection... with headache and thirst. Do any of you recommend anything .... I am in the wars of late. I hope you are all enjoying your day... it is 11pm here in the UK , and very hot..I am just watching a programme on TV called real life crime. It is on every night this week and documents young people thta are killed through knife/gun crime. Its very sad, the UK is getting worse in this respect and younger people are commiting a lot of these crimes. Have you noticed this in America.  Sometimes I feel very sad living in the UK , because it is a lil unruly and not like it used to be. I love being English but when things like this happen I feel ashamed. Ok I will quit the waffle , I love you all Sisters , and I am so glad I have reconnected with this site again, i went through a stage where I couldnt bare visiting, so its a big hurdle and emotion somewhere in my head that I have gotten over. Lots of love .... there is so much warmth here on this thread... I feel like we have all been friends forever xxx Much Love xxx ",

I think I am at a crossroads. Work is just too busy , I have been at my new shop since a year last April and it has gone from being the quietest to the busiest Subway around. They want me to keep my labour real tight and so we are all working like dogs! We took £1100 the other day berween just the 2 of us... I am very disillusioned... I think it is quite madness... I am really thinking of quitting while I a ahead.. and work for a company that can afford to run a place with enough staff so that we can get a break in the day.... lol I want to ask your opinion on my health, for the past one month especially pre menstrual I have had terrible headaches... they make me feel sick etc... so at the age of 40  would one presume this is pre menopausal symptom... the headaches are driving me nuts... I never had them before, I have to shut my eyes and hold my face. Maybe I am over tired over stressed I dont know. xx I just thought it may be my age ???? Any advice would be welcome xxx I love you all ... I need to get back to reality instead of slogging my guts out xxx ",

I cannot believe that I am on a week away from work to come down with this!

Anyway I have been reading still on other topics for  couple of months mainly it was due to a hip pain I have had for 8 weeks now. The doctor is sending me for a fasting blood test. Meanwhile a month or so ago , I received my BRAC1 gene result and unfortunately it was positive, so I have been to some counselling sessions. I am advised to have my ovaries out and my other mastectomy, I have been coming here to read on the topic and am at a loss with everything at the moment.  I have been back and forth to my dads for the past 4 months whose chemo has failed him. I want you to know that I am around and still travelling the journey albeit  I have become very lonely with it.   How do I reconnect with this path I have pushed up the table for so many months . The burden is still there even though I have tried to escape it  ",

I went through months and months of switching completely off from it all, maybe after I had recovered from chemo I had to go away and regroup. Thats my way of coping I guess. After my mum died I did the same thing.... maybe its what  my head needs to rationalise. So I went  from a care freeish girl .... to having a bootface journey... then recovery period... switch off...and come back like I look down on the whole time in little episodes.... I think I have compartmentalised everything during my break from the board.... Does this make any sense ...xx    ",

Basically they email you assignments and you book the time slot etc and confirm you will be doing it...then you go to the store or whatever...and evaluate them on the given questions from your assingment doc. Then you rush back to your car and write everything down....whence you get home you go on the net with the assignment # and fill in all the quezzys. They pay between 10gbp to 25gbp  for ten minute job ...thats quite cushdy xxxx   I cant find my british pound sign on my laptop.... but for you it would be between $20 and $50 I had my ex texting me this morn...to tell me the Child Support had hijacked his wages and he was threatening me he would pack his job in blah blah blah .... I havent had no child support for months now...but he has enough money to go out drinking etc.... I am not bothered so much of the money as the principle.... its bang out of order.... !!! So now I will have to see what he does ...hes a bleep bleep bleep bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeep ...lol....fill in the expletives if you please...you may improvise xxx xxxx",

Basically he was at the Sanantonia sp? Breast Bootface conference...and there has been a huge long study on Taxol against ECMF ...the ECMF results faired a little better than taxol...and before all that on another study taxol faired a little better than Taxotere...also the side effects and the toxiacation is far less with CMF  than taxol...so I am extremy relieved. I will research the conference he went to ...it was Dec or Jan ... Where is sanantonia though?...      (the trial was a UK and Europe one ) Well I had a chest Xray today and he is sending me for a bone scan...I have a lot of swelling on my sternum..to the side of the surgery site but not actually on it...he is concerned about it..expecially the soft tissue...and it is very painful xxx I am drinking my coffee before the nausea sets in...very very tired today.,....and really hacked off with it all xxx Much Love xxx",

I have now started to take my strong pain meds again ...just to take the edge off the discomfort and the emotional stress.... Karen I hope you will find a balance with meds too.... You have so much on right now...and having just had a scan and the stress of waiting...the worry of your dad ...the worry of EVERY GOD DAMN THING ...you have every right to feel weepy....I wish we were so much closer .... I am sending you bombastic loving vibes over the ocean. These post are always messy when I am on steroids...I cant put into words anything in the correct manner.... The shingles seem to be getting better...I have rested not much ...Tom rang me this morning to ask me to work...I told him to get knotted...lol....  sighs....  I am back in tomorrow... I have a lot of empathy with the relationship you have with your dad Karen.... our dads mean the world to us....I always envisaged looking after him and a role reversal as time went on...I never expected him to see me at 38 just like he saw my mum at 38...it is so ironic timing. It has brought back a lot of sadness to him...and I feel so bad ....  Karen  your dad loves you loads and at times the situation must feel overpowering...please know that this bond you have will never ever be taken away no matter what.... A bond that goes beyond the realms xxx Sorry for my grasshopper post ...I cant think straight xxx",

He offered me a trial... and I went away to think about it. I agreed to do it after a long chat with him...I was a little naive and in hindsight I am relieved at the outcome. As the random \"generator\" chose for me to have some of the older treatment..BUT more frequently. So what I am having is the same as other people... However I am sure now that they will decrease the dose or leave longer between ea cycle ....god I hope.... xxx Well today ...I am starting to feel a teeny better...I have only had a couple of nose bleeds...but I am still very sore in the mouth. I have only had to sleep for a couple of hours this afternoon..which is a sign I may be on the up xxx  I HOPE I spoke to my dad today and he is begging me to go on the sick...he doesnt know how I manage to work...so I have promised him when I am on holiday on the 7th ...I will write a financial plan out ... and IF when I go back to work ..I still feel rough I will get a sick note for a couple of weeks at a time....my dad would do anything for me ...but I feel really bad if he had to support me..when in reality it should be a time in life that I am physically able to look after him...he understands how independant I need to be....but I also now know it is imperative that I have some of the stress of this crazy life I lead eased for a while...xxx I am back at work tomorrow...so I will see how it goes...I dont even feel like going in to be honest...I have pains in my chest and pains in my head...but I will give it a shot xxx Well I hope everyone that is AWOL is doing good....I miss you all xxx Candie thankyou so much for your thoughts and prayers xxx I love your avator..where is that picture taken xxx Please know that I am forever grateful to all of you for keeping me going through the difficult times and pushing me along the right track ...I would have derailed without you all xxx THANKYOU FOR ALL THE ASS KICKING THIS WEEK!!  So the yellow bricks are ahead and we are on our way again !!!

I didn't want this! I never asked for this!  and then realised a few days later I wasnt getting anywhere...but still I protested right the way through to the anaesthetic ......  We will get through this and learn to live with it...(even though its not what we want)...you have a lovely sense about you, your OH must be very proud... I had a chinese last night ...thats about the third take away recently....its funny how takeaways make you feel better...mmmmmmmmm LOL Well I am off to pick my sons up in a minute...a ten minute drive in the dark....and its freezing outside!  Later I will have a bath and a quiet chat with my scar ..... in a way welcoming the sight of it...Its very itchy tonight so I might bear to put some cream on ...

However Claudia my breast nurse phone today (remember 'I do not want to be in Claudias' club...but she is so lovely) and I voiced my concerns about treatment etc....and had most of them covered...I had a bit of a sob about dying and selling my car because I wouldn't be around to drive it...all the usual thoughts etc....I always feel so much sadder when I am slapped in the face with appointments and confronting this... Well I am a little downhearted since the call as Claudia told me there was no way I would be able to hold down a fulltime job for the next 9 months.... I am sooooooooo down to say the least and more worried about having the treatment .... I am going to research the first course of epibrucin every 3 weeks for 12 weeks....and take it from there...Valerie if you could let me know how long the side effects take to wear ooff that would be so great...I know its different for everyone..but I just need a generalisation... Anyway I have been spaced out all day which hasn't been a bad thing all in all...lol....I just need to find my fighting spirit...and wish the next months away... I will be sad when I lose my hair as I will always wonder if I will be given the time to live and grow it back....I am starting to think my head is abnormal in thought.... Hope you're all having a good day... Much Love xxx",

Got to hosp for 730am and was terrified...so terrified that they moved me up a place...and had to really go at me to have it done.I  ended up having triple pre med...before being taken down at 11 am.... they told my partner I would be an hour and half....it wasnt until 5pm that I came back as my blood pressure was dangersouly low and they couldnt stabilise it. I came back to the ward and had a horrible sick night from the morphine...they ran out of every type of nausea aid until they had to jab me in the backside lol....  Before they gave me pre med I was protesting and shouting 'I dont want this done and I cant protest if you drug me up' ROFL, I ended up in fits of laughter and so did the nurses,they offered to make a banner with sue protests...I protested again when I got to anaesthetic...but they saw me through it.  Yesterday my dad came to see me...which was a great thing....its all so sad...  Today they took my drains out as I insisted on going home...I am in a bit of pain but I am so relieved...well just going to have a strong brew.....once again I thank you all. you are tremendous...xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",

The pain is still there under my arm ...and I feel like I have rubbed my right side over a rough brick wall....until the friction has almost ignited my body lol....I will try go nurse tmw and phone clinic up However I am 8 days post op now and am more whirlpooled mentally... At first I was diagnosed and in shock,then terrified of surgery, now I am waiting for results and treatment I cannot make plans for the future...I do not know if I will be alive in years to come or whther I will have to suffer painful treatments in the meantime....I dont want to live like this at 38 and the feeling is comparrable to a HOUSEFLY BEING TRAPPED IN A JAMJAR WITH THE LID SCREWED ON FOR GOOD MEASURE AND NOWHERE TO GO.... I feel at gods mercy...

Dont worry too much about the surgery...this time 2 weeks ago I was at the night before stage...I decided to shut my eyes and let the whole ordeal pass...as I had no choice...it was either do it or sink...it was a very annoying feeling and I protested right until the end...even with triple pre meds....  Honestly truthfully and right from my heart Poppy ..you will feel a lot of relief come the 9thth of November...I woke up and that relief came before I was aware of any discomfort.....  I will be thinking and praying for you on Weds....I always look out to see if you have been here xx Hope your OH is  holding 'strong' for you...he sounds like a good one  He will be an absolute godsend through your journey and as things progress he will take comfort from doing everything he can for you ...me and mine sometimes feel all helpless together and then we roll our sleeves up and carry on....I am thinking of you both x Much Love xxx",

I will bear in mind the hormones they put in food....I am thinking of taking my own lunch into work and not eating any more subway Just with the diagnosis I know it didnt grow with hormones etc .... nobody obviously knows what makes it grow... However as I said right at the start of this thread I think it may be genetic... Maybe I feel worse as I have PMT ...and stopped taking as many of the strong painkillers that were taking the edge off of reality...

I stumbled to work.....lol....I don't know why I am laughing...but stumble is a good description...I always seem to see a characature in my head of this silly girl...when I am thinking about what I do.....Karen hit the nail the other day about seeiing this journey as if it is happening to somebody else.... I had a really bad breakdown on the phone with my dad last night... don't get me wrong I just don't know what it is....everything drives me to tears and screams of frustration inside....like running up a mountain with no knees.... My dad has offered to pay me for taking the time off of work...as he says I shouldn't have the pressure of feeling I need to....my boss told me he would be paying me in full ages ago....but I still feel guilty for finishing an hour early.....so why do I do it if I don't truly need to....well I suppose I don't like to lose...and I love my job....I have always been a workaholic ..... its quite good for my nature....and so if I fell down flat I would have lost out to bootface....maybe I am becoming obsessed with overpowering this illness... See me rambling here .... I am so like you describe yourself Karyll... So today I am tired .... and disjointed and don't know what... and my arm..especially my wrist on my bad side has been aching like mad...and is swollen... Am I whinging tonight here ...lol....my head keeps going blank....I need a pick me up and a kick up the backside!! I am certainly going to mark down my bad days....day 5 and 6 were bad with a sore throat etc...and day 10 +  I am exhausted! Hopefully I will get a few good days in soon...before I go back which I am ultimately DREADING.... I will shurrup now my sleep is appalling too...I am tired.... but go to bed and my eyes wont shut bcos I feel too zany ... Much Love xxx",

I mean Miss Piggy when she is in mood mode ...with Karate chop noises....while I fight this bootface...I have her voice in my head for some reason....strange .... I have had a busy day at work...we get so busy on a Saturday ...making 300 sandwiches just over lunch alone...anyway I have been grinding my teeth all day long   .... really grinding them and feel hyper....whats wrong now!!! I haven't taken any tabs apart from anti d's  ....my friends have been laughing ....they tell me I will have to chew gum like a drug addict ..... I don't like how I feel...and I don't know if it's normal.. Well two things important to me tonight...one is my other breast...it has been sore for a few weeks...my gp checked me over and said it may be a s/e to the anti d's it feels like there are lumps all over it and a couple of prominent sore ones...and it is reminding me of my other side...what to do ...what to do....she said she would keep an eye on it.....does anyone else get this soreness with drugs...it is dragging me....  Secondly.... my o/h picked me up a book from the library today called fighting cancer...and the whole of the chemotherapy chapter was negative ....and it's really got to me.... I feel like I am being conned by the oncologist and that in most circumstances it doesn't work...do you think different authors/people have different views ...because I feel like I have just smacked myself in the face...I am going to throw it outside and let it go soggy in the rain! I will be googling it all night now..... Why am I grating my teeth ...lol....good grief ...it's a nightmare... I will do some reading.. Much Love xxx ",
