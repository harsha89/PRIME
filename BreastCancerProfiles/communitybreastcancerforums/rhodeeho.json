I don't really know how they characterize high risk other than the BIRADS score that the radiologist assigns. Try to keep yourself busy and GOOD LUCK!",

The last 10 days have been the scariest of my life, but I also learned a lot.  I will NEVER underestimate the importance of regular screening, and I found a very helpful place with lots of caring people who are willing to support complete strangers.  I thank you all for everything - I couldn't have gotten through the last several days without you (((thank you!!!))).
