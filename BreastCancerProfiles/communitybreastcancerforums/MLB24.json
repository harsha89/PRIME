    "Content": "MLB24 wrote: Hello Everyone, So I am almost 22yrs old and just went through a yearly check up, and found what the doctors are saying is a calcified lump in my left breast. I have felt it and it is hard and seems rounded, but not sure. They are sending me in to get an ultrasound and then possibly a diagnostic mamagram next week. The doctors say that it is probably nothing but better to be safe than sorry, however, There faces seem to say different. I know the risk for someone my age is extremely low to be diagnosed with cancer, but contrary to what my family sees I am really nervous about this. I am trying to stay positive and be strong for my family because they are freaking out considerably. I just figured this would be a great place to vent and feel a little bit better about everything.
