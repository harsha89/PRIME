    "Content": "MOA wrote: I was diagnosed with IDC on March 7, had an appointment with Breast Surgeon 3 weeks ago. The BS surgeon explain the pathology report. I am ER+ PR+ HR-. She did an ultrasound and found that a I have a swollen lymph node, this came back benign. I also did the BRCA test and it came back negative. Before the MRI my tumor was at 2.3 cm. My surgeon said it's early stage 2. I had my MRI last Wednesday, and went to see my medical oncologist on Friday. I found out that the MRI showed that tumor is 6 cm. This really scares me. How can it be that big, I am really scared and having a meltdown. I was doing a lot better, before this news. I went to see my PCP last week and told me that the bloodwork showed good kidney, liver, thyroid function. I am really scared that this already spread. My medical oncolgist ordered a PET/CT scan for this Wednesday. I also have chemo talk appointment this Wednesday and may start my chemo on Thursday. The port is not in yet so my onco said that we will use the vein. I will have 4 rounds of AC every weeks and 12 rounds of taxanes. Does anyone have any experience where the MRI showed a larger tumor? Before the biopsy, I could hardly feel the lump and now it feels hard and large! Log in to post a reply",
