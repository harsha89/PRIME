I came to this because right now Im not sure what to think. I have an appointment with my doctor tuesday for my annual checkup, and because my left breast has been very tender for about a week now, and its not menstrual related.  About 10yrs ago I went for an ultra sound on the same breast because it was the same way, I was made to feel it was rediculous for me to be worrying about breast cancer, I was too young, and what I felt was nothing more than caffeine related. From that point on I stoppped doing my monthly exams(the doctor, a female, made me feel rediculous for doing what we are all preached to do as women, pay attention to our bodies!) and before I knew it....Im 35. Since then I have had to have a biopsy on a large nodule in my thyroid(which if you've never had to have, I highly suggest being knocked out for! lol) Thankfully that came back negative. I have also had an abnormal pap, and yet another biopsy on my cervix, again negative. I have always worried because, although I dont know of any women in my family with breast cancer, there has been cancer in my family; my father, grandfather, and a great aunt. I am over weight but not \"obese\", and I tend to have a fairly healthy diet, but have always loved red meat. At checkups, my blood pressure, cholesterol etc is always normal. Not that I think these are factors leading to the cancer, but have primarily been in good shape healthwise in other areas, with exception of and underactive thyroid which runs in the family and I take Synthroid for. I have been able to keep my mind on other things thru the week thanks to work, but today the fear is starting to settle in. I dont want to tell my mom as I dont know if she can handle the stress of worrying right now, shes my best friend btw, lol. So here I am! I have also taken a Zanax today to try to make it through! Thank goodness for those! Although it hasnt kicked in yet, lol. Reading everyones replies was bringing tears to my eyes that complete strangers could be there so compassionately for each other, you are all amazing!! Thank you for \"listening\" lol and I will take any knowledge you have to guide me through this, the good and the bad that may be waiting around the next corner.  Tons of hugs to everyone!! Liz ",
