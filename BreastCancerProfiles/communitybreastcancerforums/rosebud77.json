Footballnut- I have the  bloody scabby nose thing but only when I wake up each morning.  Not real nosebleeds. I feel as though it is from the extreme dryness/ losing nose hair. Not to be super gross, but I've gently  wiped the area with a wet q tip to clear the scab each day.   (Yuck- sorry!)  My doctor would probably not be pleased with me messing with it.        My eyebrows got really thin after 7th chemo round and I've lost bottom lashes on right eye only  (Taxol).  I'm grateful they hung on this long -but it looks weird and lopsided.  I expect to lose more lashes on last dose of Taxol. Waking up with same sweats and tingling feet  so I could have written your post.    ",
