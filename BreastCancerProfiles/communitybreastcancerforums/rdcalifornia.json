I skipped the mammo last year ( stupidly) but when I went this time they told me they saw \"nodule measuring 1.5 cm. with unclear edges and some microcalcifications\"  suggested another view instead of CC view.  So I went and had the 90 degree view and I asked them if they were going to do a magnification of the area since they were imaging it anyways and they said NO as the order was just for a 90 degree image.  Got a call that day and was told that I needed another image done but this time with magnification...had that done on Thursday and was told last night that I need an untrasound of the area since they now see \" nodule with amorphous microcalcs\"  it doesn't say whether they are clustered or scattered, just that they're there. My doctors office is the kind of place you have to be on top of them all the time.  They actually were mailing me the request for the 2nd and 3rd tests instead of calling me to tell me to get them scheduled, I live less than 1 mile from them so I went and picked up the orders instead of waiting the 3 days for the mail to arrive, pffff.  They dont seem concerned at all, and really I am not too freaked out about it, but more just want to know one way or the other... Anyone with anything like this before? Log in to post a reply",
