I just finished my third infusion of TAC. I have to say for me the worst part was losing most of my hair after the second infusion ( despite using cold caps) and the fatigue that sets in days 3-7. Otherwise I feel pretty normal. I also have the BRCA1 gene mutation so I have been concerned with reocurrance once I finish this battle. Anyone else in a similar situation?",
