Ravzari-Thank you so much for the info on weight lifting restrictions and better idea for thetime frame. I have a very physical job, and wondered how it would limit me at work as well. The doctors don't seem to give much info before things happen and it's hard to prepare myself like that. I very much appreciate the feedback you all have given. Thank you all so much",

      "Content": "Sep 16, 2017 08:26AM pinkvictory wrote: Hi Cece, I'm sorry that you have to go through this. I chose bilateral mastectomy. I started off with abnormal mammo(micro calcification identified), then needle biopsy(ADH was discovered), then lumpectomy(when cancer was discovered).Each time, my diagniosis got \"upgraded\". I couldn't put myself through the constant anxiety of the watch and wait every six months. I also didn't want to go through more biopsies and waiting for the results. I wanted to avoid radiation and if possible, tamoxifen. I didn't want to have the what ifs hanging over me all the time. I usually have a tough time making decisions, but this time my inner voice was very loud. For me, I felt the more regrettable choice was to keep my breasts for the aesthetics. If you are thinking of reconstruction, it's my understanding that it's more challenging if you first have radiation. Additionally, if I had radiation and lumpectomy..and there should be a recurrence/new cancer...my only choice would then me mastectomy (because you can only do radiation treatments to the breast once in a lifetime, according to my surgeon). For the most part, my doctors were leaning toward reexcision to get clearer margins, followed by rads and meds. For me,It came down to save my breast or save my life. I was sad about the idea of losing my breasts. I did like my breasts, and it was hard to think about. But my gut kept telling me\" the more regrettable choice would be keeping them.\" I'm glad I listened. My choice was confirmed when my pathology report came back showing more cancer in an area that was not picked up on with mammo or MRI. I do not regret my choice. My gut was telling me what was right for my own situation...and yours will too. This is a copy of what I recently posted in another thread: I think that each persons experience is unique. There are\" good\", bad and middle of the road experiences in everything in life. This is a difficult diagnosis for anyone to hear. Then we are faced with numerous decisions. We each have to make choices that we feel best suits our own individual situation. None of the decisions are easy. There is a lot of information coming at you, that now you try your best to make sense of...and that process in itself is exhausting. I strongly feel that knowledge is power. There's a lot to digest. I got copies of ALL of my reports, looked over every word, researched myself and made my (long) list of questions up from there. I asked lots of questions. There are many helpful threads on this site as well. You will be able to hear a variety of experiences that give personal perspective in addition to and aside from medical studies. I looked at many web pages and trial studies and tried to analyze all of it to come to my own conclusion. I tried to weight the pros and cons of all treatment options I was offered. I also looked at risk vs risk...short term and long term, to look at it from different perspectives. The really important point to keep in mind is to listen to your gut. After surgery, I thought that when I looked at my scars in the mirror for the first time, that I would burst into tears. When the time came, it was quite the opposite. I looked at myself, and I was PROUD. I made a decision that was exceptionally difficult. A decision I never wanted to make. BUT, I made the decision that was right for me...and you will make the decision that is right for you. I wish anyone reading this peace of mind and a smooth recovery.",

I told her \"I don't follow people magazine, but I know how I work, and I will worry.\" In addition to my already being diagnosed with cancer on my left side, my \"prophylactic \"side was heterogenerously dense(51%-75%). I said I was concerned that they couldn't effectively screen me if they cant see such a great area of my breast tissue. Continuing to discourage my decision..she said \"it doesn't sound like the breast is the problem, it's your anxiety.\" Bet she'd feel differently if it were her body! After my mastectomy, When she gave me my final patholgy report, she said something along the lines of - sometimes you just need to follow your gut (gee lady, thanks for your support now ). I am happy to say that I will NOT be seeing her again! Being faced with this diagniosis is not easy. It opens the doors to making many decisions, each one leading to another fork in the road. Nomatter what you ultimately decide , just keep in mind that every tough step is one step closer to having this part behind you. I will continue to keep you in my prayers.",

Glad to have the obgyn visit done with no additional bad news. I go for my official follow up with the plastic surgeon following my exchange surgery end of May. I think that while I was actively going thru surgeries etc that I have been so busy solving the problem, that I couldn't step back long enough to freak out. Now that things are quieting down, the emotions have been all over the place. Yikes! I don't regret my decision for a minute, but I wish I could go back to normal...the old normal. I never worried about my health before. Then,one day last June changed my whole perspective. I'm sure this will pass. This week is better than last week...so far. Hopefully this will continue to improve. I thought I would be reassured by follow up doctors appointments and didn't expect it to bring this level of stress. Hope everyone is well .",

This week, they gave me a tube top binder that has much more compression and another fill. Hopefully this does the trick. Apparently if they took out drains today, too much fluid build up in body can produce infection, but if drains are in too long that can open me up to infection as well...ugh! Either way, they said next week they have to go no matter what. Yesterday I was more active, therefore produced more fluid....so they told me to take it easy.

I know what you mean about that triangle sharp edge feeling. After my first fill it seemed to provide some relief regarding that part. I think it must have unfolded the expander to relieve the area it was pressing against. My first one was a light fill(30cc's). I did have some mild muscle spasms(chest felt tight) but it was not too bad. As far as the fill itself, I was nervous about that being painful, but due to being numb in the chest, it didn't hurt me. I have had a few fills since. None of the fills themselves hurt. The pressure after my second fill was tough because they switched me to a tight binder( to help slow down my fluid production...my drains were in a long time ). The combo of extra weight from the fill, muscle spasms and the binder, were hard on my lungs. Thankfully, in two to three days, things calmed down and my body adjusted. That has been a consistent pattern so far, that after a few days it gets better. My recent fill, I no longer had to wear the binder(yay!) and it was all around easier. Hope you have an easy time with yours and that it provides you some relief. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised that the fill itself is not as bad as the anticipation of having it done. It was the one time I've been happy to have numb chest.",

I learned a tough lesson with all of this so far =-stay ahead of the pain. When I first got out of surgery I didn't do as well with the anesthesia as I did with my lumpectomy. Not sure why, but I was throwing up and in exceptional discomfort. It took a good amount of meds to bring me to a more tolerable level and the nausea wouldn't give up for a while. I don't think this is typical, as it seems most of the others posting came out doing well. I am glad to have that behind me for sure. Didn't help that the recovery nurse was asking me where my mother was because they had been trying to reach her and couldn't. I knew without a doubt my mom would have been by my side as soon as they gave her the OK. The nurse continued to tell me they can't get in touch with her anywhere. I told them something was wrong then and now I was worried something had happened to her . So, instead of recovering ,I was in and out of it, in pain, nauseous and freaking out about my mother...thanks to my nurse. Needless to say, I was so relieved when I was moved to my room for the night. My new nurse was amazing and made me feel comfortable and well taken care of. They discharged me from the hospital on the 10th. Thrilled to be home, but still exhausted and sleeping a lot. I tried to cut back on the pain medicine too soon and that turned out to be a BIG mistake. That made the drains painful to deal with...lesson learned...back on meds, even though they wipe me out. Have been sleeping in a lift chair that I rented cause I don't have a recliner and I am so happy to have it. Makes getting up when I feel weak so much easier and it's helpful for sleeping on my back, seeing I am a side sleeper. Every day is getting a little bit better or I'm sleeping and don't know the diffference lol. Best wishes for speedy healing to all. Now to get thru my next pathology report...fingers crossed..",

Can't wait to have them taken out and then I assume I should be able to comfortably cut back on pain meds at that point. I too find all of the research, testing and statistics on this diagnosis to be very confusing to say the least. I feel your frustration when we are just trying to make sense of it all. After all of the years of cancer research, you would think it would be much easier to decipher the information. None of my doctors have mentioned onco type to me either and I am very upset that I have not been given the full picture. Maybe that will be part of my next report? I hope things get better for you and that you can get those darn drains out sooner than later. Not sure what the output is when they decide it's ok to remove them, but I have a feeling I will have mine a bit longer too... Sending healing thoughts your way",

I continued to take it when I came home, but being on a schedule of meds round the clock gave me a bit of digestive trouble. I originally added senna(not sure that's how it's spelled), but it's a laxative to work with the stool softener. My visiting nurse suggested a dose of milk of magnesia with a dash of warm prune juice...not very tasty, but did the trick. I too was concerned about mobility, but it was more manageable than I was anticipating. Definitely comfy pull up pants/ shorts will make life a little easier🙂 Nicolelady- 🎂🎈happy birthday and to many more happy and healthy ones from here forward! Mrs.winnie, good luck and best wishes for tomorrow",

When I got my confirmation call (they left a voicemail)from\" nuclear imaging \"at the end of the day on a Friday before my big day, It instantly stressed me out. I thought there was some kind of mistake. check in with radiology? What??? I'm supposed to be having surgery!. moment of panic, due to not being well communicated ...and now it was the weekend....AND... What do they think they are doing to me?? It turned out to be the radioactive isotope injection they use to locate lymph nodes. For all of the anxiety about going thru that part, for me, it really was not bad at all. It really didn't hurt because it is injected just under the skin. Wasn't worth all the worry I put myself thru about the confusion or the procedure. Wishing you the best, I know the days leading up to it can bestressful, but you will do fine!",

I don't say that to freak you out, I say that because it may help ease your mind, and address any concerns or questions you may have. If you are uncomfortable with what they are saying... follow your gut is my advice. If you are going to lose sleep...there is no harm in having someone else look everything over. I don't like when doctors are dismissive of any concern one might have after going through this experience. That makes me feel fiesty! Peace of mind counts for a lot. It's your body....you have every right to understand and feel comfortable with what is going on. Wishing you the best... and answers that bring you peace",

I wasn't sure I was emotionally prepared and thought I should focus on healing first. Today, I finally felt ready to take a peak at the new me in progress. I am so relieved....I thought I would burst into tears and I didn't want to mourne my loss. I still have my bandages on where my nipples used to be, and I can't see the full effect of the inscision yet, but I have to say I am so relieved that it was not upsetting! I am feeling kinda proud that I made this very tough decision, followed thru with it, even though I was scared...and that the marks on my body represent the story of my life and how I will survive. In my pathology report they did find some invasive cancer cells that did not show on previous screening and thankfully my nodes were clear. I am so glad I listened to my gut. Prior to my surgery, my oncologist said she would \"strongly argue against a bilateral mastectomy\". As you all know, This whole thing is such an emotional roller coaster, but, for this one moment, it feels good to feel a little strong and empowered. I really would love it if this feeling could last, but I know there will still be plenty of ups and downs. When we all get through all of this, I hope for all of us that we will forever feel stronger, happier, healthier, more empowered, more fulfilled and more self assured than ever before! Best wishes for all of you who are recovering and for those of you leading up to surgery",
