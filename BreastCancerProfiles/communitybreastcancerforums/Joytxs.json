Not a club I ever thought I\u2019d be in! When you get to Texas, we should meet for coffee. You are blessed to have your daughter and husband to love on you. My son is 4.5 hrs away at college and I miss him! Prissy - Thank you for your kindness. My RO prescribes Radiaplex gel and cream which my insurance denied but the nurse wound up giving me tubes of it. It is similar to Miaderm in that it is was created for use during radiation. It worked fine until my 3-4th week and that\u2019s when the irritation really began. Be diligent with moisturizing and the more the better. It\u2019s Friday for those of us who are in treatment and need a 2 day break. For those who are done, rest and recover. Thanks you all for listening when I needed it.",

For me, the pure aloe seems to calm it down, but itching is new so I\u2019ll have to figure that out. Damn these extra rads and nodes. Salamandra, I hope you get your bounce back to start back to work next week. I had no idea that Rads would be this tiring. I want my bounce back already! KerLyn, I find that my patience with some people is better and with some worse. I can\u2019t figure out this roller coaster these days. Carebear, I have the lanolin, but haven\u2019t used yet. I\u2019m 16 treatments in and still using aloe and miaderm. What did you use for itching? Egregious, I am ordering the aloe spray as I spill half of the bottle trying to get it on me. Deedeet, I\u2019m with you on the Skin SE rollercoaster I\u2019ve got to figure this out. The underarm is sore today and I\u2019m getting the pinging pains now.

DeeDeeT - I felt nauseous the other day and it took until after noon for me to feel better. I have no idea what it was from, but a ginger ale and crackers helped. It's a wonder we all aren't nauseous every day! Dani444 - I just finished 23rd rad and I just started blistering under arm this week. I asked the nurse today for silvadene and she said they are holding out for when it gets really bad. I have two more regular treatments and 8 boosts left so this makes me think it might get worse. Has anyone been given silvadene? Instead, I was given a Domeboro medicated soak to try. I'll let you all know how it goes... My underarm is really dark and the blistering is just a lighter shade of dark. I'm pretty numb from the nodes being removed, but I am starting to feel the burn of the blister. I see the RO tomorrow and I'm going to let him know. The Lindi skin cooler roll is nice to put on the hot spots. It doesn't stay cool forever, but nice. At this point, I'm looking for complete relief and it won't come for a another couple of months. Waaa, waaa, waaa. Thank you all for listening and being here. ",

I completed 25 full breast/node treatments on Monday and had 2 boosts. Yesterday I went to my MO and she was clearly in shock when she saw my neck and underarm. She was going to get me started on AIs, but after seeing my skin condition she said absolutely not. She called one of her RO colleagues to ask what she could recommend to help my skin condition. She also had the RO RN come talk with me and bring me more samples of of Radoaplex HA, calendula cream. All were really shocked at how badly my skin looked. I told her I wanted to stop the boosts for now and she didn't discourage me. I didn't go yesterday or today. I let the techs know I wasn't going to make it and this morning the RO called me to ask what was going on. I was honest and told him my quality of life stunk and I was getting depressed. I have blistered and weeping sores by my left collarbone that hurt every time I turn my head. I have blisters under my black underarm. My entire breast is red red. He was kind and told me he was sorry that they went so far without understanding He how bad it was for me. I let him know I wouldn\u2019t be back for a while So I am holed up wearing tank tops in my house when it\u2019s 35 outside and my dogs even think I\u2019m crazy. Im sorry I\u2019m not the poster child for no side effects. He asked if I would come into office a week from today to check in and see if I had made some improvements. Gosh let\u2019s please pray for healing for all of us! So yes I know where you are and how it feels I\u2019m waiting for the heat from my skin to cool and give more a break. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll go back and finisH the last 6 boosts. I just want to heal.",
