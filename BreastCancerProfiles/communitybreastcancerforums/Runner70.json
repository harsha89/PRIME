Even when told I needed a biopsy I wasn't worried. \"Just a precaution\", I told myself. Didn't really give it another thought until 3 days later I got the call that changed my life forever. I lost it. I got so depressed and felt paralyzed. I took the rest of that week off because I couldn't think straight. During chemo I worked all through it and even ran a half marathon. But my last 2 treatments hit me hard and I became too tired. I think I worked 5 days in May. I have a physically demanding job and to add to my stress, I'm self employed so I've been very grateful I have an emergency fund. I don't have any sick leave benefits. I'm starting back part time on Monday. Hopefully I'm ready. I'm making myself crazy sitting home alone thinking about recurrences and stuff. I think everyone is different. We all respond different to chemo and all of us have different degrees of stress at work. You just have to figure out what works for you.",

I took Claritin as I was told but just about every bone in my body felt fractured. Even my jaw and sternum. It was over the weekend so calling the on call oncologist was not helpful since it wasn't my own doctor. I was treated like a drug seeker. I tried taking leftover norco from my port placement but it didn't help much at all. Monday my oncologist gave me Percocet for it and that made the pain tolerable. My 2nd shot had the same reaction. On my 3rd and 4th shot, I was started on decadron a few days before the shot and for some reason that helped. I've had appendicitis and I would chose that over the bone pain from neulasta any day of the week. That neulasta commercial still makes me cringe.",
