The lactulose option is good, start taking it a few days before each IV and keep on with it for the next 7 days after IV. Very gentle. Brand name is Dupholac (here in South Africa) - lactulose powder stuff, just put it into your tea 3 times a day - can't taste it. Note:  not Dupholax tablets - they gave me serious pain, too strong. Loads of stewed fruit (apricots) plus hi-fibre bran every morning did it for me. And TONS of water throughout the day and night. Oh and massaging your tummy (colon) in the right direction also helps to move things along. Use google to find out exactly where your colon goes up; along under your ribcage and then down, is if you need too.",
