This past Feb my variant was upgraded to \"Sufficient evidence for dosage pathogenicity.\" The variant is rare \u2013 it's only been seen two other times, one is a family in Germany and the other is my brother. Aside from the BRCA1 variant we also have extensive family history (on both sides of my family) including a male with breast cancer so I don't feel like this is something we can ignore. We have two sons, ages 15 and 18. They know about my genetic testing but not sure it's occurred to them that it could affect them. I'm 5 weeks out from bilateral mastectomies and will be having reconstructive surgery in Oct, so discussing all of this with them hasn't been a priority. But I'd love to hear from any of you with genetic variants/mutations about how you discussed the situation with your children? I'm understanding children need to be 18 before they can be tested? (I was BRCA tested through Myriad then cancer panel through Invitae.) Thank you so much for any insight you can share! This is hard stuff! Diagnosed at 42 yrs old.
