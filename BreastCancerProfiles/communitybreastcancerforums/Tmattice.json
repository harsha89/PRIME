They are going to start me on Letrozole, Palbociclid, and Goserelin. My doctor told me no surgery, no chemo or anything because it won't change the outcome. I'm scared because doing those things I would think gives you a better chance of living longer. I'm scared and dont don't know what to think. I need as much time as I can get cause of my babies.  ",
