But there is no research - zero - to date showing that proton is better than photon for breast cancer. Trials on prostate cancer - which should benefit from proton therapy and its reported ability to spare normal tissue - are not conclusive, with one study showing GI symptoms to be basically equal years out. The RADCOMP study on breast cancer may well show a benefit, but results are likely years out. And the proton industry talks about sparing the heart, but modern 3D photon therapy with breath hold can usually limit heart dose to under 3 Gys anyway, even with left-sided disease The fact is that many proton centers were built by for-profit companies at costs exceeding $100 million each, but are not attracting the patient base they anticipated. So they are scrambling to bring in patients, including tv ads that, in my opinion, play to patient fears. Baltimore, where you had your treatment, was in danger of going belly up and had to restructure. Please understand, I\u2019m not saying proton therapy is bad. But I do think women should not be swayed into spending thousands of their own dollars or delaying treatment in search of a holy grail that may, in the end, just be copper. Everyone, please talk to your RO. Do ask about proton- and also what they can do to lessen effects if you end up with photon. Check into RADCOMP and see if it might be right for you (although my understanding is that women often still pay out of pocket.). Get a second opinion. Just please don\u2019t be swayed by hype.",

I believe most would agree that proton can be a very good thing in pediatric cancers, where patients may suffer delayed radiation effects years down the road. The study you quote, though, doesn't compare proton to photon as far as effectiveness or side effects. And as far as the goodnewsnetwork.org article, it is HIGHLY misleading, saying the survival rate for neuroblastoma can be as low as 40%. Yet the cancer.net article that statistic links to says the overall survival rate is 80% - which is neither higher nor lower than that achieved in the proton group. I'm sorry but, in my opinion, another example of hype. I don't blame the insurance companies for not paying for an unproven - and very expensive - technology until the results are in.",
