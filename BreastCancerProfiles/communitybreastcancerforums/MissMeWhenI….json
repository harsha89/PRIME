I wanted to know if it would hurt and how I would feel once the surgery was complete. She snapped at me: You'll feel fine!  I was so upset. While this is an everyday occurence for her, its my one and only time. I asked if she had a port and that kind of put her back to a human level. So, how will you feel right after surgery?  I felt GREAT!  But I was high on drugs and there was no pain!  Afterwards, I think it was a little tender but not too bad. They would have done chemo on it next day, but decided to wait a week. I get a lidocaine injection before chemo, it stings only a tiny bit; but I put on my big girl panties and it's over almost before I know it. I feel absolutely nothing when the chemo setup goes in, and maybe some slight pressure when it's removed. I am sooo glad I decided to get it. They were having trouble accessing a vein and chemo actually hurt...until my best friend, the power port, arrived. I also get PET meds through it.  The techs over at radiology are not so skilled so if I need a PET, I go to the doctor's office first to get the tubes, etc., put in.",

I may as well do something wild and crazy, so today, had it dyed bright, hot pink!  I figured since its so thin, and will probably fall out soon, I was just going to do something fun. I wear a hat all the time anyway because it is super thin.  If I don't like it, it will wash out or I'll have it dyed bright blonde next time.",
