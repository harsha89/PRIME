I put gauze on it with tape. The first day I changed the gauze 3 times in one hour, then it gradually tappered out. No showers for me either until it stopped.",

Seeing that every day, gives my spirit a boost.",

Port was placed on my right side, an inch or so below the collarbone, with the tube going into the jugular. No risk of lymphadema for the tatoo. Use a licenced tattoo artist.",
