I also take Iodoral (and iodine supplement-you can also try Lugol's).  Please research iodine deficiency and how it affects our thyroid and breast health by causing cysts (you can also read reviews on Amazon). I also take a liquid multivamin (Nature's Plus Source of Life) I also take liquid Chlorophyll ES and Sovereign Silver (colloidal silver). I also take Epsom Salts baths at least twice a week (for magnesium and to draw out toxins). I also take melatonin before bed. Another big change that I've made recently is to stop using antiperspirants and purchase only paraben and aluminum free deodorants.  The great thing is that the Chlorophyll I take is also an internal deodorant so I have no issues with body odor anyway.        ",

The oral medications are not working well at all.  I will take any recommendations you have.  My heart is breaking, I just want to help her. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
