I think the disparity between those who experienced this as barbaric/awful and those who felt a \u201cscratch\u201d is not necessarily pain tolerance but a change in the procedure over the years. I talked with my technician about the varying responses here and she said many (not all :() hospitals have changed their approach. I had only one pinch, not several, and no saline was used (I guess that makes a big difference). It was just under the skin by the areola, like a TB skin test not an injection. It was truly just like a sharp scratch; not even as painful as the lidocaine injections before biopsy and radioactive seed implant. I did not have any topical pain medicine. This was at George Washington hospital in DC.",
