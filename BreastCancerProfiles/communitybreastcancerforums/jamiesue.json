I'll have a DMX and then two weeks later my implants put in. I'm really curious about care when I get home. I know I'll learn in my pre-op but does anyone know...will I clean the incision and how often? I've read recommendations for panty liners instead of gauze. Will I be wrapped up really tight? When can I shower and bathe? Thanks for any info!",

My bathroom has been a project I want finished before surgery. It's probably too late for you to take on something like that but if you can find anything to focus on to take your mind off it. I like the pampering part too though! There are some great posts on recommendations of what you'll need after surgery (or what would be helpful) that you could review. I'm also spending a Saturday cooking soups and freezing them before surgery with my BF.",

Christine, I think I only know that I'm stage 0 because it's DCIS which I think is always stage 0. However, that may change if they find more invasive cancer during surgery. They think there may be an area that the MRI \"could not see\" that may be invasive. MCBaker, I'm also in WI. And I'm also on a LOT of gabapentin through my pain management clinic that I go to for chronic pain (spinal stenosis, majorly pinched nerves,neck issues, etc) What did you mean about being careful? Evily, thank you for starting this group! After months of this, I can't believe I'm having surgery in 2.5 weeks. Whole new level of stress!",

Then I go back for plastic surgery 2 weeks later. My PC wanted to give my skin 2 weeks more to heal. We are hoping he can just put the implants in and not tissue expanders. And they are doing prepectoral. We are also hoping that we can spare my nipples. I'm having my sentinel nodes removed during surgery because there is a possibility I have an invasive spot that the MRI couldn't see. This is no fun waiting 4 weeks to find out if I have invasive. Now that it's just 3 weeks from today, I am getting nervous. It's hard to not know so many things when I go into surgery until I wake up. At the moment, I don't have any appointments next week, for the first time since August! So much work I have to do before being out for 6 weeks. I have hardly worked lately, it's so hard to focus and concentrate. Then I pop online and start reading about this and an hour has gone by. Looking forward to being on this thread. You all sound awesome!",

I had my DMX 11/15 and it went pretty well except the nerve block didn't work so I was screaming in the recovery room when I woke up :) My PS wanted to wait 2 weeks for me to heal so my next surgery was 11/30 with hopes to put in implants. I wasn't ready yet so I got prepectoral TEs. Here's my issue...I started to feel decent between surgeries but this time, I'm two weeks out and and utterly exhausted. It's been the past 3 days, just the thought of getting out of my recliner is too much, usually by about 3:00pm I'm ok for a couple of hours. I am getting enough sleep at night. Any advice, thoughts, ideas on this? Thanks! Jamiesue",
