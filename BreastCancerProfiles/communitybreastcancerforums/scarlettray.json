      "Content": "scarlettray wrote: Hello everyone! I had posted on here during April about my concern of two lumps on my armpit. This was what my last post said: Hello everyone. I am a 22 year old woman. Starting March 28 I woke up to an unbearable pain under my right armpit. I saw a big swollen and red lump. I told my mom and she said not to worry about me having cancer because it was just probably a swollen lymph node and that it would go down. Well 3 days later the pain was gone and the swelling went down. However, I still feel the hard lump in my armpit, but it just doesn't hurt or looks red. It is kind of noticeable under the skin, and top of that one there is a smaller one not visible under the skin, that one is also hard and not painful. I am freaking out because everything I have searched online leads to breast cancer. I have an appointment with my gynecologist on Monday, and I am terrified. I have had ultrasounds before, 2 of them. One was on 3/31/2016 and the follow up on 12/10/2016. The first one registered benign breast findings, with solid lesions that measured 0.9cm and 0.6cms.The one I had on december registered new multiple cysts on both breasts measuring from 0.4cms to0.8cms. Also on the deep left there is an intrammamary lymph node measuring 0.7cms. They had suggested I have another ultrasound done in 6 months, so I was gonna go anyway to get it done, but I hadn't felt anything on my armpit and I don't know how long those lumps have been there. I only noticed them because of the swelling and pain that started on March 28th and went away after 3 days. Should I be this concerned? This is driving me crazy! And I don't know what I'd do if I end up having breast cancer, especially at this age! I feel very depressed just thinking about it. P.S. My grandmother had breast cancer and survived it 3 times. So it does run in the family. --- Now fast forward to April 25th, I went to get an axillary ultrasound. The results I got were vague in my opinion. This is what it says: \"Ultrasound of the right axilla was performed in this patient presenting at least two palpable nodules in the right axilla. There is no associated pain. The visualized lymph nodes of the axillary region were a total of five lymph nodes that extended from the upper axilla to the right breast tail. They range from 0.6cms to a maximum of 0.9 cms. They appear to show benign characteristics. There are no other axillary masses. IMPRESSION: Essentially normal right axillary lymph nodes.\" My question is, what are normal axillary lymph nodes? I know there are lymph nodes all over our bodies, but swollen ones that don't go away? I started feeling these on March 28th when I woke up with my armpit swollen and red and very painful. I thought since it seemed to be a swollen lymph node due to an infection or something like that, that they would go down once that infection had gone away. But they are still present to this day and I just don't know why. Will they ever go down? or stay like this? Should I still be concerned and look for more answers in another doctor? They haven't gotten red anymore or painful, but sometimes I do feel like a sharp, electric pain that goes from under my armpit area down to my wrist of that same arm. Or sometimes a sharp pain on my right breast. What should I do? I am still worried about this...thanks. Log in to post a reply",

My boyfriend is telling me it's most likely nothing serious and that I shouldn't worry, but reading stories about people who have been misdiagnosed or ignored because they're too young to have it and dying because of it makes me even more worried. Should I push my gyno for an ibc test, thermography? In case she says something like \"you're too young to develop something as rare as ibc\" or will I come off as overdramatic? Thank you again :)",

I do not wear a bra to bed just any comfortable and loose shirt. I'm guessing if it's irritation it should go away in a few days. Hopefully they are faded before my appointment on wednesday, if they're not I'm totally going to get it checked.",

      "Content": "scarlettray wrote: Hello, when I woke up today early in the morning I noticed 6 tiny red/purpleish spots on my right boob on the top, about an inch and a half away from the nipple. 5 of them are in a straight line and the other one is like almost two inches far from the rest. They hurt just a little bit when I press on them and they are not scaly or bumpy, they're like under my skin, flat and smooth. When I press them they do not get clear, they stay the same color. I googled this and inflammatory breast cancer came up and I've been terrified all day. Also I don't think they are insect bites because I always cover up to sleep and there aren't insects like mosquitoes inside my house. I Haven't been able to eat or think straight (I get really paranoid and worried sick whenever something may link to cancer/breast cancer). I'm only 21 years old and I had an ultrasound a couple of months back because my gyno and I felt a lump on my left breast. The results came back as \"well-circumscribed solid lesions in the right LMQ and left LOQ. They measure 0.9cms and 0.6 cms, respectively. These are all in probability fibroadenomas based on the sonographic characteristics and the age of the patient. There are also minute cysts in the right 9 o'clock position and left LMQ. These range of 0.4 cms.\" They recommended me for breast ultrasound every six months. So in a few months I will have another one, but I read that ibc cannot be detected on ultrasounds/mammograms. So I'm super worried, I already made an appointment with my gyno this wednesday, but I just wanna know the opinion of other ladies in the forum who may be familiar with this. The dots are a bit smaller than a pin head. I wish I could post a picture but I read the guidelines and it says not to. But I really need some peace of mind, I need to do some college work and I can't concentrate :( thank you ladies! Btw, my grandmother (mother's side) is a breast cancer (not ibc though) and lung cancer survivor. She developed breast cancer twice if I'm not mistaken, already after her 50's or 60's. And I'm not pregnant, so not a sign of breastfeeding. Log in to post a reply",

Also, I have 10 cats but it's because I rescue and give for adoption. 5 of them are actually mine, the rest are foster cats. Right now I have 8 in total since yesterday a lady adopted two of the kittens I was fostering. My cats names are: Bombie, Luna, Tiger, Akira and Salem.
