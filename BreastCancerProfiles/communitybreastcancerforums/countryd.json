I got a mammogram and an ultrasound done. The technician said that it had some solid characteristics, but not completely, so although he couldn't rule out malignancy 100%, he suspected it was a cyst or clogged milk duct. I am 41 (was 40 at the time) and had just quit breastfeeding my son four months earlier. The plan of action was to have another ultrasound in four months.  So I had the ultrasound this past Tuesday and they called and told me that I need to have a biopsy done. The report reads as:  \"The lesion today measures 2.7 x 1.4 x 2.3 cm in size.  It clearly appears solid on today's examination.  There is no acoustical enhancement, and there is some questionable intermittent shadowing. These findings suggest that it is not a benign simple cyst.  The lobulated and slightly irregular borders are slightly concerning for the possibility of something more than a benign fibroadenoma.  The lesion is wider than tall.\" To me that sounds bad, like it is cancer. Does anyone know what all of that means? I am so very scared right now. Not scared about me, just scared for my kids. I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old. The thing I worry about is when my son was about 3 months old, he refused to feed off this same breast. I am wondering if I had this way back then 3 years ago and if so, is it too late to treat? I don't want to leave my kids. Please any advice would be helpful. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
