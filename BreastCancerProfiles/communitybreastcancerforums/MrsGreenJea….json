I felt nauseated and lightheaded through the weekend, and went back to work as a pharmacy technician the following Monday. I was feeling mostly normal by then. Last week I had BMX under general anesthesia. I told them that I react poorly and they gave me the scopalamine patch before surgery as well as some IV meds during. The patch was removed the following day, on Thursday. Although I was weak and somewhat lightheaded, I did not experience nausea until a day or two after that. By Monday I was miserable, and my PS wrote an rx for Zofran which has helped a great deal. I am still experiencing side effects 8 days after surgery, mostly a fuzzy brain and still some lightheadedness, as well as a lack of energy. I wish you well, and hope that you do not suffer serious side effects. Good luck.",

Making my appointment was a major task (multiple office locations, minimal availability at each), Checking out after my appointment, I commented that they seemed pretty busy. The girl checking me out said yes, they were very busy. \"I don't even know why we are taking new patients\". Really???? This is what you say to a new patient??? It was all downhill from there, it actually got worse. I will absolutely NOT be returning there. Meeting with BS next Tuesday, I will ask her for another MO recommendation. As others suggested, run, as fast as you can. Her attitude toward you was completely inappropriate and unacceptable.",
