I know I have hurt him by hiding this from him--when I told him finally we had to talk he thought I wanted a divorce because I had been so distant for so long--I couldn't risk him feeling it. I have a surgeons appt. on Friday and will go, but I feel so stupid that this has happened.  The internist said not to worry about those feelings--just deal with now--but I am so worried that my grown children will be so hurt by this..they all know people whose moms have dealt with breast cancer and are doing fine now--and their mom isn't going to be that lucky.  I'm sorry if I bored anyone with my story but my dh and I have decided not to give many details of this illness-he knows how ashamed I am-it seems like sometimes people want so much info--I guess I just needed someone to talk to about this.  I just don't want anyone else to know how long I waited to seek help.  One of my best friends was dx in Sept and is having an awful time just recovering from rad.. and she sought treatment early for a very small lump.. I don't know how I am going to deal with all this now--I know that I won't be able to keep my business going if I am sick all the time..I don't know how I am going to tell my kids and my sisters...My mom had bc when I was in high school and I can still remember the day I came home from school and saw her crying--she had the mast. that was what they did in the 70's and no reoccurrence for 25 years only to have it pop up in her stomach--she died 8 years ago.  Thanks for at least letting me write this down even if no one reads it--your posts give me hope and were what eventually made me go to the dr.  Thanks!  Dx 1/2008, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/3 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

A bag of fluids and some extra anti nausea meds and I am back to my old self! They told me not to wait so long the next time! Next time as soon as the nausea starts I am going over to the office, I really didn't have this issue the first time so this was new for me. I also do have to do the neulasta because my counts this time were low and even stayed a little low with the neulasta. This is a result of chemo second time around. It is nice to have a place to vent!",

Now here I am with right breast her2 positive. I just did the first treatment of tchp with neulasta last wed and it has totally wiped me out. I don't see an end to this nausea even with compazine or zofran. The diarrhea has been manageable at least. The first time around the chemo was bad but after a not so bad 3rd day I was able to continue working...a little slower maybe. Now I can't even get out of bed....is this a result of the TC twice or just the combo of the other drugs with it. I don't see doing this 5 more times. Thanks for listening.

My tumor is 2.5 cm so I am already stage 2 and from reading it seems like I might get that, too. Tues. I do scans all day to see if either of the cancers have spread. I have been Ned for 5 years! I can't believe my luck getting the 2 most aggressive cancers! At least this new one has more treatment options than the trip neg. this one is er- and pr+ her+\".Thanks for responding!

After reading thru the forums for the her2+ group I just don't know if I can go thru this again. I have been fortunate to have had some really good years, have felt great and just recently expanded my business. I don't know if at 64 I can go thru taxoter again and a year of the herceptin. Reading thru the forums it looks like it is going to be a tough road and having done it all before I just don't know. I met with the surgeon today who is sending me back to the onc next week and is scheduling lots of scans to see if either of the cancers has spread. Just really bummed tonight.
