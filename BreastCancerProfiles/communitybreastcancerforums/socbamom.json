My oncologist suggested I might want to wear a mask while working but my boss was not too crazy about the idea (me either). I work in an outpatient, orthopedic therapy clinic and we typically see only adults but I work closely with them and sometimes they come for therapy sick. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thanks!

FLwarrior, thanks for the warning. I hope things improve for you and the American cancer society can help you. Maybe the social services dept at the hospital where you had your surgery can give you information on local resources? Good luckÂ with your job search!",
