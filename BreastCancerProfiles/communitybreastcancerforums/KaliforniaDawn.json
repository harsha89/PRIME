    "Content": "KaliforniaDawn wrote: Hi Everyone, I went to see another doctor last week for a second opinion regarding breast pain in my right breast. I also started experiencing tingling in both of my breasts throughout the day for the past week. The doctor said it's hormonal and she doesn't find anything unusual with my breasts that warrants an ultrasound. I am frustrated and a nervous wreck! Has anyone ever had a doctor refuse an ultrasound? I really would like an ultrasound or mammogram. What can I do to get one? Log in to post a reply",
