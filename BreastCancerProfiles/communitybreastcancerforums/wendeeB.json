Drove home, stopped at the library to pick up my sons Minecraft book, came home, ate some lentils with green beans,  onions, and garlic.  Cooked the kids dinner.  Figured I should update.  Blessings to all my sisters here.

How about gymnastics or cheerleading? Do you love to cook or bake? I know this disease had taken over our lives but getting back to what truly makes us feel passionate can help alleviate some of that stress. 5 days out from infusion number 2. I feel pretty good today. This time, after infusion number one, I felt very sorry. I ended up having to take pain pills. This time I'm making do with Advil and so far so good .  I'm still rinsing with the baking soda, salt, and warm water at least 3 times a day. My mouth is a tad bit sore. But last time I got this nasty white coating, not thrush, but it made it a lot worse than this time. I hope everybody is faring well. Have a fantastic day and blessing to all.",

This is a man that has nothing and is getting ready to be evicted from his house, but yet he still thought enough to do that for me. People are so considerate.   Becca, I don't know if it would be appropriate with the beating that are mucosal lining are taking, but I have done an enema before when other things aren't working for constipation. Have you tried prunes? or brussel sprouts and broccoli and other roughage like that? good luck to everybody facing round 2. I am about 10 days out from round 2 and am feeling just fine. All my kids are sick at home with a cold and I can tell that without Neulasta I probably have a cold too. still haven't lost all my hair yet. As a matter of fact I found some new ones trying to grow in, and my pubic hair is trying to make a return itself. blessings to every single one of you",

I employed, I was not too surprised when I was diagnosed. I start chemo Oct 2.  Taxotere and cytoxan, 4 cycles.  My mo and her PA have me set up with four Pre and post meds.  Plus advised claritin for the potential bone pain.  My pa spent 2+/hours with me and I'm somewhat confused as to the timing of the meds.  I guess I'll figure it out as Walmart called to say the Rx are ready (another slap of reality) I'm going to bring ginger water or ginger tea, ice to chew, a green smoothie or juice, plus my paperwork :) to keep busy.  I've got 4 new zen books that I'm psyched to read.  I want to ice my hands/fingers but haven't figured that one out yet.  Not going to shell out for cold caps. What I'd really love is for someone to walk me step-by-step through what my first day will be like. Anyone else get anxiety when you have to talk to a member of your \"team\".  I honestly cuss when I get off the phone with them.",

Grammy!  If you look in other lady's signatures you can see if they've had a lumpectomy (like me)/or mastectomy (sometimes abbreviated MX or bmx or umx for bilateral or unilateral) you'll do great with your infusion!  No worries. Hey Trekkie! (Me too;) so happy it was just a cyst.  I did everything they said for Neulasta.  Claritin and Advil prior, as well as post tx.  By 4 days post shot, I could still function but it sucked.  Has nothing to do with pain tolerance either.  I homebirthed all 3 kids.  I NEVER take pain meds, but this really seems to be what hydrocodone was made for.  I didn't feel high, or loopy, just sweet pain relief.  Blessings to everyone.  Deadlifts, hamstrings, shoulders, and cardio today!  Get out there!",

I looked down at some paperwork today and there were a few strands on it. That made me giggle.  Purchased a 30x30 square of Hello Kitty material and fashioned a head wrap to sport around the house.  Rack pulled 305 for 2 this a.m. @125 lbs. Pretty happy with that. Eta:  got my blood work Friday.  My wbc are still in the 13s.  RBC good too.  I hope that means incan skip the Neulasta.  I know it's ultimately my decision, but I'd like my MO to be on board. 6 days till infusion #2.   Let's do this.",

I know that getting up and getting moving seems really difficult, but its the only thing that honestly makes me feel better. @becca, hugs sweetie!  it is still kind of bizarre. Even though you know it's coming. I chose not to shave my head. And I still have about 1/8 of my hair left. I read one person describing it as a thin veil of hair. If you're going to go the beanie or knitted cap route, it leaves a little bit of hair to hang out at the bottom so its not so noticeable. only five patients to see today! I'm glad. I'm feeling somewhat fatigued today.everything taste like, well, nothing. All except for my hot cinnamon green tea. But that doesn't matter, because I know I have to keep the good food to get a good results. So I'm going to persevere blessing to everyone! Remember, we are happy, we are healthy, and we are 100% cured!",
