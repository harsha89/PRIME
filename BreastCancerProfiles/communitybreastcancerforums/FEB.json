I know that it is not accepted by mainstream medicine, but if read by someone who is experienced, as my doctor is, it  can be just as good at detecting tumors. It is basically an infrared camera that takes photos of the breasts and looks for vascular irrregularities to detect cancer. My left, good breast was blue in color, my right was red and orange, showing how hot it still is. What I also like about this is that it is totally painless, and I did not want to get my breast smashed again, since it is so tender. I am not advocating this for anyone else, I just feel it is the right choice for me. A mammo did not find my tumor, I did, so I will continue to check my breasts for any changes, have the therms, and monitor everything else with a doctor I found who is into alternatives. Needless to say, my onc is not happy, but I have no plans to go back to her anyway, unless I absolutely have to because that place is so depressing!",

They look for symmnetry in both breasts to see what is consistant in how the blood flows. Since a tumor has to be fed by extra blood flow, it will show up as having extra feeders running to it. My doc has  a really good website that explains it. Go to drnick.net and check it out. This doctor was recommended to me by my chiropractor. She had met him at some of the seminars she regularly attends.",

I didn't want anyone to call me for weeks. I took a lot of long walks with my IPOD. I assume you are English because you say MUM, so my advice is to buy your mom an MP3 loaded with Sting's music. His mom died of BC and his music really spoke to me. Tell her to just go out and have a good walk with Sting. Not only will this help her physically, it will help her get her head together. My two favorite albums are \"Sacred Love\" and \"Mercury Rising\". Even now, when I am past treatment, I walk to his music and it \"heals my soul\" (Sting's words from Lithium sunset).",

I took a walk after every treatment, and tried to eat very healthy. My radiologist said that I am proof that exercising through treatments minimizes side effects. I had only mild burning too. Even though it was easy for me physically, emotionally, I was a wreck. I had a lot of meltdowns because the whole thing scared me so much. I still wish I had said no to rads. Since my nodes were clear and I had wide margins, I just do not think it was worth the expense and trauma in my case. I also decided against arimidex which, may be another reason I had an easier time physically.",

Explore your new surroundings and walk a lot. I had no fatique from the rads because I walked everyday after treatment, even during a very cold and snowy Chicago winter. The fresh air was invigorating. It has been proven that exercise really helps with the SE's from rads. The walking also helped me get my head together. It took a while, but walking helped me to make peace with the whole damn situation. I also did it all with no drugs. Yeah it was hard to sleep sometimes, but I started taking melatonin, which is a natural relaxant and an antioxidant. I read that the ingredients in some of the prescribed drugs can actually feed cancer so I stayed away from them all. Melatonin has no such effects. I guess you are lucky that you will only go for 3 weeks. My treatments lasted 2 months because I had days off for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I thought it was never going to end. Boy did I cry tears of joy the last day! I still wish I had never done rads because I worry about the longterm effects, but I guess I got through it. I am still really mad at my doctors for pushing it so hard without explaining it all to me. I still think they over treat us when we have early stage tumors.",

How many more marks do I have to deal with?!!! But mine are really small, and my eyes are so bad I can't see them anyway! It seemed like the treatment would go on forever, especially because it was through Christmas and New Years, but  I finished and feel great, so I'd like to pass on what I did. First, bring some music to listen to. My techs were great about putting my music on the CD player and playing it loud. It was a great escape. After the treatments, I drank a lot of water, and ate an apple on my way to the river walk in our town, where I walked every day, even in the cold and snow. If it rained, I went home and did an exercise DVD. I never got fatiqued at all. My radiologist's are so impressed with my energy level, that they are using me to encourage others to exercise through it. I realize that I am very lucky because I did not have chemo, but I think I would have tried to walk through that too. It not only helped me feel great physically, it helped me deal with the emotional roller coaster, that I had a really hard time getting off of. ALso, my skin looks great. I had a little redness under my arm and a little itching but that was all. I took a multivitamin some omega 3. I know this is controvesial, but my radiologist said it would be okay. I also used a lot of cremes, from day one, both what they gave me and my own. I took a lot of baths with aloe, putting the wask cloth on my breast instead of immersing them. I also found a great cream at Sam's club with vitamin E the day I finished and I put that on liberally several times a day. My breast is looking and feeling great and it will be only a week tomorrow since I finished. I know that everyone is different, and a lot depends on your skin and the radiation plan they set up for you, but I went into this determined that I was not going to let it get to me. Attitude is everything. Good luck to all of you just starting! You can do it!",

Be pround of yourself and continue to listen to that inner voice. It will help you to make the right decisions. And finally, from this moment on, concentrate on getting yourself healthy again.

I will never do any of the walks because I am not convinced the money goes to people who are suffering now and to research for a true cure-which should include preventing this damn disease to begin with. I do believe it can be prevented. I am tired of my doctors pushing drugs with bad SE's but refuse to look at holistic means of prevention. I believe that our food is a major reason for the increase in BC and it is time some of the money gets spent looking into this. We need to get rid of the stuff that causes cancer. But of course, think of how much money the cancer industry will lose if they actually find a cure or learn how to prevent this in the first place. Now if I was assured that the money I raised in a walk would go directly to survivors like you Luann, who have children to raise and limited resources, I would be all there, but as long as it continues to go to these mysterious studies that have not improved cancer treatment much or educated the country on prevention, I want no part of it. My prayers are with you all for a happy and healthy outcome.",
