Everyone have a nice Thanksgiving - sending good thoughts. Pam  Diagnosis 10/26/10, ILC,6+cm,Gr 2, ER+ PR+, Herc2-",

Try not to be too scared - the waiting was definitely alot worse than the surgery.  God bless everyone with  a short recovery!",

Praying my nodes will be clear after surgery.  I'm scared but trying to keep my faith up.  I'm going to go Xmas shopping this week-end - but I really am NOT in the mood!  I'm sending positive thoughts for everyone.",
