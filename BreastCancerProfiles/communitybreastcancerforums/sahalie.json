I trusted my surgeon completely.  He was recommended as the best in my area so I felt great about that.  You want people taking care of you and your body that you have complete confidence in.  I also had the BRCA testing and it came out negative.

In my paper this morning is a huge article stating how with using the oncotype testing it is known now that certain women were less likely to die or have a relapse if given a less harsh drug than Adriamycin, a mainstay of treatment for decades.  It states the gene test can help predict whether some women need chemo at all even among those whose cancer has spread to their lymph nodes, which typically brings full treatment now. The oncotype DX test measures the activity of 21 genes and gives a score to predict risk of recurrence.  This test is for estrogen positive women and whose hormone driven cancer had spread to the lymph nodes.  I remember reading this info in my clinic's reading material but now it's official due to the statement by the National Cancer Institute and the test's maker, Genomic Health and Duke University's cancer expert it states the test would give valuable information to guide treatment for patients in the future. Your information and analogy needs to be in every paper in every town to bring it home to men and women that this year alone according to statistics more than 178,000 new cases of breast cancer will be expected in 2008. Keep up the good work Bimmer.   Please give Diane a gentle hug from me.  Tell her the grape vines are bare now and frost is covering them making the rows look like glistening strings of shimmering magical vine ornaments.",

It doesn't hurt, it just feels tight and kind of weird. You have some wonderful suggestions and advice here from the other posters. I would be interested in the sports bra as I didn't have reconstruction and would like the feel of one for the light pressure it would give my chest and maybe help the tight feeling. Do you girls think the sports bra would do that? I just wear tee shirts or soft blouses ~ no bras and I love the freedom. Good luck and I hope your surgeon can help you alleviate the pain.",

I was sore but used only Tylenol and felt amazingly good for what I had just been through. Over five hour surgery. The drains were something else though. The BC side did drain more. I kept a schedule of amounts per my bsurgeon request. Sometimes the area would begin to hurt like a tight pinch so I would \"milk the tiny tube\" which would take care of a small clot and then I would feel much better. Someone that has gone through the expanders will come along to help you with that area I'm sure. My drains came out after two weeks. Best of luck.  You will feel better in no time.",

I knew I wanted a bilateral mast. so I wouldn't have to deal with another Kaboom down the road. So he granted my wish. I had NO reconstruction and have been so much happier ever since. What a free feeling. I wear no prosthesis.  Just comfortable tees, tanks etc. My husband passed suddenly three weeks after my bilat. mast. at a young age. He was the love of my life so will not marry again so I figure what the heck. I love being flat chested.  I save money on not buying bras. I hated bras anyway.  So restricting. It's funny though.  Even two years from surgery every now and then I get the feeling I need to pull on my bra strap. Good luck with your decision. I am extremely happy with mine. Sahalie",
