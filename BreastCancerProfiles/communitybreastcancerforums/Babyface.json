Dh and I travel alot and do some very long flights. Knock on wood in my 2 years post diagnosis, I havent yet developed LE. I havent worn a sleeve on any flght, but do have one with me should the need arise on my return flight. That said when I fly I DO drink alot of water, and every hour or 2 remoisturize the arm, and underarm. I normally constantly moisturize the arm but am extra careful on a plane to do so. One of my other favourite bds is Flyer Talk, where there are alot of discussions going on about the new travel restrictions. A number of TSA/Airline people participate in this bd. Today I posted a question re: moisturizers, water etc. re: women who have had BC surgery. Some of you may be interested. A portion of the thread is amusing, but much of it is pretty serious sitting where we all are now. Anyway here is the thread, and my post is on page 7 of the thread under with a posting name of Legalbee. http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/showthread.php?t=589864&page=1&pp=15 Dx 8/2004, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 3, 0/9 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I also had to deal with the following, \"I having problems with your veins, are you really sure we cant use the other arm\", and from another \" you should talk to you dr. and he can reassure you that you dont need to worry about this, it just doesnt happen anymore\", and also, \"the Dr. likes to work from this side, and since you dont have a good reason, I'll have to discuss with him why you dont want the IV on that arm and see if it's ok\". Quite frankly I was getting downright peeved, having people in the medical field acting like I was paranoid. I should not have to be educating them, and then once educated, argue about whether Im right. Why in god's name dont they know this(rhetoric question I know). It is almost as though the attitude is, no one gets LE, and if you do its a fluke because no one gets LE....if you know what I mean If I had LE, and had to deal with this crap I would probably not have a good arm too long, cause I suspect Id be likely using it to cuff someone along side their head...lol.

One of the difficulties that you're in right now in asking what the right thing to say or do is, is that we're all different and as you go through the process with your significant other if you're an understanding empathetic guy(and u must be or u wouldnt be here:)you'll begin to know what the right thing to say or do is. My dh was with me right from the beginning and as he often reminds me\"we had BC\" . In our case that was true, whether it be him coming to all my chemo and rad app'ts(an hour away) whether he was exhausted from trying to maintain both our businesses, or lying on the bathroom floor with me when I was deathly ill, or actually coming out with the perfect cliche' , such as \"you are going to beat this\" and saying it so firmly and adamantly that I couldnt help but believe him, or not overreacting when I was p'od at the world and took it out on him, even when I was a miserable pain in the butt, and telling him that he didnt understand, and that he wasnt supportive even though he couldnt possibly do more or be more supportive than he was....lol. I was very fortunate to go through this with a guy like that, who knew me well enough to undertand what I needed most of the time and not take any of my venting personally. Don't get me wrong, hubby isnt perfect, but you dont have to be, you just have to be there for her, understand her, and most of the time you'll get it right :)  I know I've said many times, that I could not have made it through everything without my dh. BTW, we live in Ontario as well and if you wish to pm me and we're anywhere close by ea. other I'll put you together with my dh if u  want someone to talk to .",

      "Content": "Feb 5, 2008 09:38PM - edited Feb 5, 2008 09:39PM by Babyface I go back to my original premise. Whether you like or dont like our system depends a great deal on your personal(or family, friends) experience with it. I personally am not a big fan. It hasnt worked well for me throughout my bc journey. As i said others love it and perhaps that is the point. No system is perfect and the answer is likely in fixing your own rather than trying to adopt another that also has its flaws. For an interesting story on a young woman from Ontario suffering from colon cancer who took on the health care system here see this link http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/genSearch1.aspx?cid=3150&cname=Suzanne's+Story It;s very sad, esp given that she recently passed away, but also very telling in that this woman was extremely ill and unable to get many of the treatments, and drugs in Canada that did keep her alive much longer than predicted by her Dr.'s . The drug costs really have gotten out of hand and I think that applies whether you're in Canada or the U.S. This is esp. applicable when you're dealing with cancer drugs unfortunately because many are new and cutting edge.",

As some may remember I have been the master of weird and shitty side effects to just about everything and every drug that breast cancer exposed me to. After my chemo amid the allergic reaction to AC I began to get these squiigly lines, flashing lights, blind spots and entire kaleidoscopes blinding my vision . It started suddenly one day out of no where. Quite frankly it scared the crap out of me since I had never had a migraine, and didnt know what an \"aura\" was. Never got a headache from them. After it happened again within a few days I went to the opthamologist who found nothing. This went on for 8 months(the entire time of course I was convinced....well you know) and I ended up with 3 brain mri's and countless exams. They were finally diagnosed as true occular or opthalmic migraines which have no headache attached to them normally last up to an hour, tend to be rare but can sometimes be a reaction to a particular medication. As I understand in some cases \"atypical occular migraines\" can go on and on for days, weeks or months and are evne more unusual. In my case I had started taking Nexium of all things after my chemo and low and behold within 2 weeks of my internist putting this together and taking me off Nexium these auras ceased almost completely. You've received some good advice here. Check it out, and if nothing obvious jumps out then get the Dr.s to start looking for the not so obvious. In my case because of all the various problems I ended up with post chemo(the worst being the still and continuing jaw infection and necrosis) some of the answers have to be hunted down but once they are the answr is pretty simple :)",

The pain from the armpit cord was so bad I couldnt sleep at night. When it first happened my arm got very heavy and tight. I was convinced that LE was inevitable. I was doing all the exercises, going for physio, massaging but the cording wouldnt go away and the pain remained. A month after my surgery my breast surgeon then agreed to try to snap the cord for me. It was 5 seconds of pure unbelievable pain then immediate relief. Since then (2004) I have had few problems with the arm(a tad bit of tightness when Ive been out in the heat too long, or the day after a flight I need to massage it and get the lymph flowing) and of course the usual problems with medical people doing everything they can to try to undermine my efforts to make sure I never get LE. I dont know the best protocol for removing a cord, but I do know that I wanted to kiss my surgeon after she did mine....lol.",
