I am positive most of the time and try to get on with living and enjoying life, but once in a while this little monster creeps in, i have to say it it scares me, i just want to be as i was before, i was at work the other night, came across some paperwork i had written about a year before dx, i had to re ~ read it, this was the old me, hard to remember what the old me was like, i certainly had more confidence in every way . Not sure about this consider ourselves cured.....we could very well be cured, but we will never know no one rearly knows, i hope to be a little old lady, putting in my rollers at night as i see lots of them at work, oooh how i would love that, we can only hope, remain vigilant to bodily changes and be here for each other, kaza xx    ",
