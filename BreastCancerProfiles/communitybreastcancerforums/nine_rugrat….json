And even tho i am new here the support here is amazing. i have a hard time asking for help, i have always done everything myself and its hard now that i can't. But i love my life out here on our farm and to me all the work is worth it.  Like today I got up and was in pain, but going out tending to the goats and chickens i felt better when i came in even tho i hadnt taken any pain meds yet.  If i didnt have the farm chores to do i wouldnt be very active at all.  ",

What kind of treatment are you on?  I have learned that the treatments can make pain really bad.  I am sorry you are going thru this, but this is a great site.  I dont know what i would of done without the wonderful ladies here.

I had a cough for a while and then it went away and i dont really have any shortness of breath.  So i dont know, he said it could just go away on its own.  I have a PET scan tuesday so i guess i will know more then. reading the posts tho now has me a lil worried",
