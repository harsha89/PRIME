Speaking for myself, I was not informed, given any choice or voice in my treatment from start to finish.  I have since learned to advocate for myself though.  We are faced with very tough decisions and it seems that the more we know, the harder it is to sort out everything.  So, sometimes, we have to do what feels right and NOT do what feels wrong. If I had a chance to do it all over again knowing what I know now, I would definitely do things differently.  But, sadly, it's a one way ticket, no turning back Wishing you all the best   ",

Not CLOSE. POSITIVE. <.1mm positive. He did not tell me for 7 weeks\". That smells like negligence to me, but that's another matter. Right now, try not to panic, I know - easier said than done - breathe, very important.  Take a look at this, dirty margins are not uncommon: \"because most of the current techniques result in a relatively high rate of positive resection margins together with a clear impact on LR rates and cosmetic results, new innovative surgical approaches and methods for intraoperative margin assessment are needed. Previous studies have shown that the number of patients exposed to BCT in whom tumor cells were present at or near the cut edge of the surgical specimen after resection of the primary tumor ranged from 5% to 82%, with the majority of studies indicating positive margins in 20% to 40% of patients\"  That's a lot of re-excisions ! Zavagno et al. suggest that residual disease in close margin involvement may be largely due to the existence of multiple cancerous foci and not to margin closeness by itself. Breast tumors are shown to grow multifocally in 59%, of which 71% grow at a distance >2 cm from the reference tumor. Therefore, margin status as such may be considered an important judgment factor in planning re-excision, but cannot be seen as an indicator for the presence of residual tumor in the surrounding tissue. An explanation for the high rate of positive margins reported in literature might be the restricted visibility of the tumor and coexisting ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) during surgery. Deurloo et al. found an underestimation in tumor extent of 23% in patients considered eligible for BCT, largely due to failure in assessing diffuse and multinodular tumors.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2749177/ It sounds like you have a highly qualified integrative doc who is trying to reassure you and that you've made up your mind to go ahead with bmx, can you find another surgeon you can trust ? Oh, and I would definitely complain about the clerical 'support', you certainly did not need the interference, boy ! Try to relax as much as possible, getting upset is not good for us, hugs sister",

Communication is key and trust in your caretakers vital !   Oh....I cannot believe the 'inhumanity' of that neighbour of yours.  I am so sorry for what you are having to go through, but know that most of us are having to deal with aggravating issues (job loss, hubby loss, etc. etc.) despite and on top of dealing with the beast.  Unfortunately, the world does not stop and we must go on.

Orange skin indicates inflammatory bc.  A dimpling or identation is when a tumor is large enough to be pulling on the skin which caves in and creates an indentation.  I agree with the other sisters that you need to step up the testing, although MRIs are not very dependable at detecting ILC.  Do you experience pain ? There are two great active threads that could be very helpful to you if you haven't seen them yet: community.breastcancer.org/for... and community.breastcancer.org/for... ",

You say two of your aunts.  I would insist tomorrow on at least two of the following: mammogram and/or ultrasound and/or MRI.  If you can get all three, all the better.  Each machine has its own limitations and will detect what the other will not.  I would also insist on being tested for BRCA (the genetic marker). If positive, bilateral mastectomy is a given and automatic.  If you're not BRCA, I would shop until I drop to find a breast surgeon to perform exactly what it is you want.  Best of luck to you tomorrow and please report back, we're all here cheering you on, hugs ",
