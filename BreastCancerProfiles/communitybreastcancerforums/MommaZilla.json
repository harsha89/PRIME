      "Content": "MommaZilla wrote: So 2 weeks after my port was placed (1 week after my first chemo treatment) I started noticing some swelling and discomfort in my right arm. My oncologist had me to come in immediately for an ultrasound. They found 2 blood clots in my port and arm and was diagnosed with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Why did I get this? Doc says because \"I had a port placed. Sometimes this happens.\" They gave me a prescription of Xarelto, a blood thinning medication, to reduce and eradicate the clots. (On a side note, this can be a very expensive Brand name prescription. But if you go to their website and apply for patient assistance you can qualify to get it for free.) Thankfully, we found it right away and we have not have any issues accessing my port. But this was back on April 5. It is now June and I am still taking the blood thinners and still have frequent pain, swelling and discomfort in that arm. When this happens, I just try to rest it and limit the use as much as possible. My question is how long does it take for the clots to go away and not have these symptoms? I'm just wondering if the medication is working. I would have thought after 2 months it would feel a little better by now. Plus there are a lot of additional risks to being on blood thinners, so I would like to stop taking them at some point. Anyone else going though this?

I didn't think much of the swelling and tightness. My husband told me to report it but I was just so happy to finally feel good and be at work I didn't listen. They called me to check up and see how I was doing. I was so disappointed to half to leave work and go back to the hospital again. I waited all day there to see the doctor, get my scans, wait for them to review ... but I'm glad I listened. Your both right, it is a very serious issue and I'm very lucky we found it. I didn't realize it was related to the chemo but it makes sense. I'm just so over all the pain. And it's my right arm, so it makes everything difficult when I can't use it. I'm high risk of lymphedema on my left side, so I can't do too much with either arm. This was a real wake-up to not assume anything is normal. We have watch out for everything now. And it can be really hard sometimes!!! I know I need to just take things slow. Allow my body to heal. Allow myself time. But when your doing treatments, working, married with two little ones \u2013 I want to be Wonder Woman for them when I feel good. But I know I need to take it easy as much as possible. Don't push. And try to rest my arms as much as possible. Do either of you get additional sonograms to monitor the progress? I'd like to see if they're getting smaller because the pain is just as bad today as it was then. I opted for the pill vs the shot but maybe it doesn't work as good? I don't know?",

I'm curious why you opted for the shot vs taking Warfarin or Xarelto. Even though I've been a pin cushion for the last 5 months, I'm still terrified of needles. Was it a cost or insurance issue? Or is it a better medicine? It would have cost me $425. I applied for patient assistance on their website and was able to get it for free. The XareltoI is a pill. Pretty easy and I don't have any diet restrictions. Same risks with bleeding and bruising. I'm concerned because I still have pain and swelling just like day 1 so I'm just not sure if it's working. But that may just be my inner fears as well.",
