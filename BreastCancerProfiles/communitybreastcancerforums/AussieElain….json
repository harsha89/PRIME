To say I was devastated is an understatement. Anyway I started researching and was considering LNT when I heard about LVA on BCO. Somehow I then discovered a website \"Healthunlocked\" and joined the LSN forum. A few Surgeons have posted and notably Professor Dominic Furness and Mr Alex Ramsden who are both consultant Ps and specialise in super microsurgery at the Oxford Lymphoedema Practice in Oxford England. They have found that when they both work simultaneously they have had really good results when performing LVA surgery. I emailed their clinic for more information and was quite amazed at how quickly they responded. I also spoke to my BS in Australia who voiced some concerns so I emailed the clinic and again they responded really quickly and even offered to talk with BS. They also sent a heap of attachments to help me. Long story short as I had already planned a trip to the UK to visit family, I thought well I have nothing to lose ( except a pile of money) and made an appointment to see them. They also provisionly booked a theatre date for me should I be a candidate for the surgery. I had the ICG test and was very surprised to see that there was a new pathway deep into upper arm up to the lymph nodes in my neck. Just a pity that it hadn't kept going:) I had the surgery last week under local anaesthetic which took just under 5 hours and they did an amazing 16 joins. There was no pain and I didn't even need any pain meds. Now all I need is more patience as they told me that improvement can take 6 months or more. At the very least it should not get any worse. They will be doing follow up by SKYPE how cool is that!! I have had to pay myself as my insurance doesn't cover overseas but my wonderful DH has said he would pay double if it helped me, he's also paid for me to fly business class so it will be easier for me. So don't give up hope ðŸ˜Š",

Years ago I met a Swiss professor who was involved in the health and beauty industry who told me that the state of your health could be analysied from one single strand of hair. I totally forgot this and then thought to myself that it was weird how my hair had been falling out for quite some time before BC dx. I had really long thick hair and the hair loss wasn't noticeable. I was under a lot of stress at the time and put it down to that but decided to have a good few inches chopped off to see if that made a difference which it didn't. The really weird thing was that AFTER my surgery and before my hair fell out with the chemo, it STOPPED falling out!! Has anyone else had aÂ similar experience?",

DH says it's so hot here (100 + today phew !!) that my body thinks I don't need hair as it would make me even hotter..gotta love him, he tries really hard to make me feel better!! Can't quite believe that my eyelashes fell out 2 months AFTER chemo and they too are taking for ever to come back. I am trying to master the art of putting on false eyelashes but look somewhat like a cartoon character, practice makes perfect right? luv 'n' stuff Elaine",

They also sew a lovely soft satin lining at the elbow crease area which stops any irritation.I am entitled to 2 sets each year through our Medicare system in Australia. BUT who knows I may not need them in six months as I have just had LVA surgery in the UK, keeping my fingers crossed ðŸ˜Š",
