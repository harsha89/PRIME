I have since had chemo, and Wednesday I meet with my surgeon to set up an appointment for a re-excision. I am really stressed over this. Does anyone know how often a re-excision results in clear margins? I am not able to find any stats or information online about how successul a re-excision would be.

I had a UMX a week ago and they gave me a camisole to wear with a pillow-type prosthetic. I was told in a month or so, they can measure me for a different (silicone?) prosthetic to wear. But this pillow-kind looks pretty good (from outside my clothes obviously); no one would know just by looking at me that it's not my natural breast. So what is the benefit of the one I'll get down the line? Does it fit better in a normal looking bra? Sorry, I'm sure there is a good answer to this but I just don't know it. Thanks.

Too many choices, intense surgeries and recovery. A lumpectomy is no big deal to me. And I really don't want to lose sensation in my breast. I'm only 33. I wouldn't mind a mastectomy later in life so much, but not now at my age, and while I am trying to get through my last year of grad school + work full time.
