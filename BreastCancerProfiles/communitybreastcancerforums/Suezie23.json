Ever since then, I have been on a roller coaster ride of emotions. First, I was mad at myself for having had the test done. Then, after meeting with a Breast Surgeon, I was glad I got tested and decidet to just do regular check ups for now and get a Mastectomy when Im older. ( I am 30) I had a mammogram and MRI done, all came back \"normal\" . Then everything changed when I had a consultation with an Oncologist. She didnt \"urge\" me or even advise me to get the mastectomy done rather sooner than later, but she made me realize that breast cancer doesnt care weather you are in your early 30s, 40's or 70's. So I then decided to get a mastectomy sooner than I originally planned. As in, sometime this year. I met with a PS and felt pretty confident but today I am questioning everything. Tomorrow I might be back on board again... It is such a hard decision to make when your breast are healthy at the moment. But then I read some of the stories of the brave ladies on here and all the treatments and surgeried they had to go through and I think to myself, I dont want to have to go through that! So for now, I will continue to do some more thinking and maybe go back to ask more questions. I hope you will find your path and dont have to go through the emotional roller coaster that I have found myself on ;)",
