I have no insurance and have been having sharp pain in my left breast. I have had 5 back surgeries so I am disabled and unable to do a lot of physical stuff. I am pretty scared and don't know what to do but just pray to the good Lord all is good. I live in Missouri and was wondering if them big RV looking things you see sometimes for mammoragrams are free?? I don't know what ill do if it is bad bc hubby won't have insurance for a year!!!!",
