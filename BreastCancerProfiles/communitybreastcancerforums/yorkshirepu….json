She couldn't feel the lump and sent me away...so for the following 18 months I spent every day trying to convince myself the lump wasn't there ( afterall I was 'too young', had no family history and I had followed my mid-wife's advice and breast-fed all my sprogs). Then the lump became painful; this was the last straw, so I returned to my GP and insisted on a mammo (not normally offered in the UK until you reach 50). The rest is, as they say 'history'. My breast surgeon descibed the lump as 'very subtle' and was impressed that I even noticed it! ?? Luckily for me, the 18 month delay in diagnosis doesn't seem to have altered my prognosis - phew! Anyway, the moral to my story and my answer to the question 'what's the trick to early diagnosis' ...is be 'breast aware'. Get to know your breasts, check them regularly and if you feel a lump or see any changes, get it investigated immediately and don't let anyone convince you otherwise!",
