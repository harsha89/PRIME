I would love to find someone else as I am suppose to start my treatment next Thursday and would like to know what to expect getting all 3 at the same time.. I found a thread that was started a couple of years ago, but so much has changed since then, I would like some more recent info.

ZUFFA-I have to ask a few curiosity questions..When you say the Taxotere be given over 90 minutes.. does that mean it takes them 90 minutes for it to be injected, or am I not getting it? (which wouldn't surprise me!) Also, why? Since all of this seemed to work well for you, I may ask them to do the same, but would like to have more of a back up then my friend from the internet told me to! lol Also, why warm up the Neulasta shot? Haven't heard that before.. but since you go good results, just wondering how you came up with that? TAMARA- Thanks, I will ask him next time I see him. NANCY -  I had my MUGA yesterday, so should know something soon.. both the heart problems and the leukemia sound pretty scary.. I know they are rare side effects, but still serious ones...Hopefully one day, God PLEASE, they will have a treatment that will only affect the cancer and leave the rest of the body alone!! Thanks again everyone!",

I have read a little on here about heart problems with the A part.. but the onco has not discussed any with me.. I am sure I will meet with him one more time before the chemo starts the end of the this week.. Are there others I should be aware about so I can ask him when I see him??",
