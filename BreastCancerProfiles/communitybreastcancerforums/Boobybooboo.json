      "Content": "Boobybooboo wrote: hi ladies, I had my first mammo on Wednesday of last week and I am awaiting results. I saw my dr due to nipple itching and discomfort that I had been experiencing for 7-10 days on just one side. She did a thorough breast exam and found a ridge sort of under and behind my breast (the one I'd been concerned about). I called yesterday and today but no results yet. Tomorrow I have an endometrial ablation and I really hoped I would hear before that because tomorrow will be a busy day and I may not get the opportunity to call. The strange thing is that the itchiness has not happened again since I saw my dr. I do still have discomfort but on both sides and it's typical PMS related. I can't help but wonder if I I will be thankful for the itchiness because it led me to the ridge being discovered. With the itching I was so scared of IBC but less so since the itching was so short lived (I hope) My maternal Grandma had breast cancer twice in her seventies. I'm strangely calm that the news might be bad. I am a worrier but I worry about little things, thing where my decision or control is involved, there is nothing I can do here so I just hope..... I've been doing a lot of reading here and what a nice community : ) Ann, 41 mom of two.Â  Log in to post a reply",
