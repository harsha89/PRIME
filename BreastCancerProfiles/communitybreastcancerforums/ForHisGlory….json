A couple nights ago I noticed a tightness under my arm and realized I have cording starting under there! I still have good range of motion but can see the cords and feel them. It's like a tight band that hurts if you press on it and I can feel it going down my arm!! Anyone else dealt with this? Does it get worse? Anything else I need to do? I'm so ready to be done with this stuff. I am feeling the fatigue now. Of course my RO says I'm just tired because I'm working and going there every day because of course it couldn't be fatigue from rads because it NEVER causes anything (according to her). My nausea is caused from something else and couldn't possibly be from radiation (sarcasm noted here). I am going to continue with her until my two week post rads check up and then I am not going to see her anymore. It is awful to be made to feel like every thing I feel is just annoying for her to hear. I am a RN so I can't stand to be made to feel so stupid. When I showed her the cording she didn't even really look and just said my shoulder will need some exercise when I'm done with treatment. Anyone notice that I am dealing with PMS tonight? Hopefully tamoxifen will cure that instead of make it worse. I'm so thankful for a place to vent to people who actually care! I feel for you all who are going through this a second time. I know we all keep the possibility in our minds and to know some of you are going through this with such strength. I admire you! Now if my itching will calm down, sharp shooting pains will chill...I'm going to try to sleep! Hoping for happy hormones tomorrow ðŸ˜Š",

Just curious as to what made you choose it? Hope you don't mind sharing with me. :-",

(28/8) I must admit I've been living the past few weeks like I was healed and done with this whole cancer thing so when I went last week and got all marked up, I did get a little emotional. I felt like I was actually starting to feel/look normal again so it's hard to start this journey. Just looking down at all the markings made me wanna cry! Today was very uneventful. ..they said don't put anything on until they tell me to. I am going to try to work everyday from 730 to 2 and then drive 30 minutes to treatment. I am a nurse manager at a busy skilled nursing rehab...hoping I will not battle fatigue too bad with this schedule. I will read this board to catch up....my last scheduled day of treatment is January 30, and I'm hoping to go on a vacation to Florida Feb 1. ..will I feel like going? Guess I'll have one tanned boob by then huh? :-)",

I've also read a couple books about personal stories of fighting breast cancer. If you're interested I can share those as well. Not sure if you're reading for an \"escape\" from our reality (which is where I am at now) or if that sounds appealing? (I read it soon after my diagnosis when I could think of little else) I've just started reading again since surgery. I just couldn't focus on books there for a while. There is a thread regarding that subject that is really quite interesting.",

And when I said my mouth feels awful and greasy she said that was from the radiation. ...confused! And feeling like I shouldn't tell anyone because they think I'm supposed to be ok.",

I'm using hydrocortisone cream and aquaphor daily after my rads treatment in the afternoon and at bedtime. I am starting to have tired spells...hoping it's more related to the weather than fatigue setting in. Spent Saturday just resting up and hubby and I decided to watch a movie. Can I say that every movie had someone dying or suffering from breast cancer?? We just happened on a Christmas movie and of course the mom has breast cancer return and dies at the end of the movie. Really??? Oh well....I guess it's a cancer that Hollywood likes to use because I have found it in a ton of movies and tv shows since I started this journey. I finish January 30th and have tickets to go to Florida with my family February 1st. Really hoping I feel good enough too and that my treatments all happen as scheduled. An amazing group of warriors on here and I read all the posts! Can't believe some of the stuff we sea with but we are strong and I ove a the sister support",

My underarm area is the most sore and it is tight. I had a total of 36 treatments. 28 whole breast and 8 boosts. I rang the bell but what I really wanted to do is break down and just have a good cry! I was able to work a modified schedule of 6 hour days and my job is really busy (RN unit manager). I supposed to follow up in 2 weeks and after that I'm not sure I will keep seeing this RO. The visits just seem pointless anyway. All she wants to do is see my skin. Contrary to what everyone else did, I didn't use a lot of creams. I had to use hydrocortisone cream for the itching and was told to use aquaphor. I found that my skin was more irritated when I ised the aquaphor so unless I was itchy I usually just went dry. No open areas here, but Iay have developed a seroma? Nothing is leaking but I can feel a huge lump undery node incision. Definitely have two cords that are tight that I'm trying to keep stretched I have three small tattoos and so excited to rip off the last stickers covering my sharpie marks!",
