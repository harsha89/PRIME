She indicated that if that didn't work or I couldn't take the side effects she would switch me to neupogen. Maybe that is what you will get. I don't think they would give Neulasta again that soon if you had it the day after treatment. Since I haven't even had mine yet (I just had my first A/C yesterday) I could be wrong. Good luck and I hope your counts come back up quickly. It was great to hear that you were feeling good thought. It gives all the rest of us hope. Maria",
