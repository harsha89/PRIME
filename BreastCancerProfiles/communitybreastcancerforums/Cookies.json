I hVe metaplastic (not metastatic) breast CA - very rare - 1 in 1.3 million cases of breast CA - my ki67 proliferation rate was 90% and they say my cancer is chemo resistent - responds only 30 to 40% of the time. I have 4 small lung nodules of undetermined significance - have to repeat the CT in 3 months - my hair has fallen out - I am constantly nauseous - very tired - trying to stay positive- what the mind believes the body can. Achieve - right",

I am taking miralax and 2-3 colace per day plus tons of water - diet could be better but food is revolting besides white carbs - which I have tried to limit. My husband shaved my head tonight with the help of my 4 and 7 year old - my 4 year old told me I look like a zombie and I think she may never cut her hair again but my 7 year old son told me it looked \"cool\" and that I'd save a lot of money on hair cuts. Did anyone else have a constant stuffy nose with chemo/nuelasta? I am taking the Claritin so bone pain not so bad but I am softly of clear boogers!",

I am 3 rounds in - mental foggy and emotional funk has settled in - trying to stay positive but my husband has been challenging - he doesn't want to talk about it and actually forgot to take me to chemo one day. I have to beg him to do anything - please take the laundry doe nor take out the trash - he has never been much physical help around the house but now he is completely emotionally detached and mad at me. This on top of a 4 and 7 year old with a rare cancer - I'm metaplastic - and md Anderson said my survival rate is 50% in the next three years - I am thinking of counseling -",

Also does your MO and their staff know about the insurance issue? Can they help? Is the MO new? Have you seen them yet? My heart goes out to you - I am sorry",

Metta -I am so sorry - my husband is a drinker as well -.he hasn't got plastered in a great while but has 2 glasses of wine per night - if I only had a magic time machine, I would have chosen as spouse with more of my own personality traits - he is the loud, social type that always wants to go out and sleep in - I'm the morning gal who enjoys 1-2 close friends and a good nights rest - his dad treats his mom as if she has a lesser value then himself and it took me 3+ years to even notice - I would like to train my kids to marry someone who treats them right but thus far I haven't done a great job. He has said he would go to counseling with me about my cancer but that they'd better leave him alone about his job and our marriage - think getting the door open with the lead of cancer is a start and I will have to find the strength if things don't change in a year or so to go it on my own - scary - I am sorry for you and please know you are not alone and deserve to be cherished",
