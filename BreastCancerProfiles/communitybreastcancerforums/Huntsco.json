Every day is still a darn struggle I seem to be somewhere between the living and the dying.  I look at my children and apologise (in my head) for putting them in this situation.  Its like I'm looking from the outside at this thing that's happening that's not really happening but it is (???). Ive brought future cards and journals for my children and I cant start writing them.  Im sorting, chucking, selling and tidying.  Ive rearraged the linen cubboard so my DH can find everything easily.  What's that all about?? Be positive I tell myself, take one day at a time I tell myself.  Have fun I tell myself. Oh its so hard. Ok here I go, my multiple and diffuse tumors have reduced by 40% in my liver.  My side effects are manageable, Im still at work, my 4 year old has dry pants and is no longer wetting the bed, my 6 year old is learning to swim and is loving it, we played mini golf today and I forgot I was living with cancer for one whole hour and my niece loved me so hard the other day I thought my heart would burst. Delaina-hugs to you too and yaaaaa for your one year!!",

I'm having MMM chemo at the moment third one coming up. I cant seem to find anyone else on the dicussion boards on this chemo too - maybe a new Zealand thing??? Also have it a little in my bones (hot spot) in spine but they don't seem to be worried about that at the moment. After the first chemo, my liver function tests were better (were very very abnornmal prior) but still abnormal so a glimmer of it working. I will be after a scan after my third so will be very nervous about that. I'm yet to have a liver biopsy to see if my status has changed- currently ER +, PR - and Her2-. But given tamoxifen and the chemo didn't seem to work very worried I might be ER- now. Im having trouble making my diagnosis etc public, have the little sign on public, but not showing up-so will play around with it. Angela, love the poem. Great to see other new-bees (trish, dancingvegg)joining in to read this thread and get hope from others who have got in touch. Anyone else out there? xxK",
