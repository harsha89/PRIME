Tons of severe bone pain and aches - before this I had no idea what 'bone pain' event meant. I am in the dark no longer! I even wondered if I was reacting to the Neulasta. A few nights ago I called the on-call oncologist at the hospital, who said the docetaxol (chemo drug) might also be participating in my overall pain. I made the call because my blood pressure was low and I was having some shoulder tip pain too. I didn't want to be alarmist but wondered if I was perhaps reacting badly to the Neulasta, as the blurb about it mentions these two signs. Since it can blow out the spleen if something goes wrong so I thought I should be conscientious here. I'm glad she (the doc) was not concerned and I learned some other useful tidbits. Like I should ask to keep on the steroids for a few more days after each treatment (not just post 1 day) as this could disrupt my major pain reaction more completely next time. I should take the codeine even though it may mess up my gut, because I really do need the pain management. I am finally on a continuing dose of that now (along with Naproxen and Claritin) and will continue for a few more days. I feel like this whole experience is a big learning curve - what to expect, how to plan, how to manage. I am hoping and trusting that I will find it easier next time. Re Hair - my onco nurse said hair loss can start at 6 to 14 days, so on day 10 I am going for a buzz cut at a salon that offers this service free to cancer patients. Part of this move is really to get use to 'the look.' I am very concerned about being freaked out by my bald head and thought this would be a middle ground to get me through a week or so. And the? Look Good, Feel Better facilitator said it makes it more manageable for the hair to fall out. Someone else suggested a satin or silk pillowcase - anyone try that yet Oleysa - then I guess Biotene is not the magic bullet. Just a bandaid that I hope keeps working for me! BeyondBless - any advice on placement of the port, or anything else? That's a long time to be sore, and I am sorry you are struggling with that! I have requested this device, but won't get it for another week or two I think. Part of why I want it is that it can also be used for blood draws, not just infusions. Good luck all. Just take it one day at a time - a stupid cliche, but it holds water these days!",

I will have radiation and endrocine therapy for 5 years too - though it may be an aromatase inhibitor instead of Tamoxifen - not sure, but I am post-menopausal, so that changes the landscape somewhat. This is all to be determined, including the number of radiation treatments. I don't meet with the radiation onco until May 7. Hard to wait for that info, but so it goes. I'm HER2- so no Herceptin for me. Thanks for the YouTube link. I often fall asleep listening to podcasts or whatever, so I'll add this to my list. I had my first cytoxen and epirubicin yesterday. I've been prescrived FOUR anti-nausea drugs, which kind of freaked me out that there are so many but so far they are working, though I feel stunned and sleepy. I would pick that over nausea and throwing up any day though! Did anyone get mouthsores or hand/foot syndrome with these or similar drugs? The nurse mentioned these as likely SE, both of which I did not get with Taxotere (docetaxal). I did use Biotene mouthwash which must have helped. However, I did get oral thrush with those cycles. For those with acne, have you tried adding a 5% Benzoyl peroxide gel morning and night to your skincare regimen? I'd put it on before my moisturizer. I just get a product off the shelf at the drug store - costs about $5 (Cdn). I did that at the beginning for a while, until the chemo drugs started making my face too dry, when I had to step up my moisturizer, but if it ever looks like an acne event I include it again for a few days. I've had this product around before CA for the occasional breakout though. As a few have mentioned, I am trying to stay grateful!! I hate going through all this, but glad it means I get to LIVE!",

Growing and learning through this cancer is a hidden gift, even if not one any of us would choose to seek out. I am four days out from my 4th chemo session, but the first one with EC. The 3 antinausea drugs I was prescribed have kept that in check, thank goodness, but each has a sedative side effect, so one is layered on the next and the next. I am SOO wiped out! Today, I got up at 11 and then was largely napping from 130-430. My sweet husband got us out the door for a 3 km walk in the snowy sunshine after that, but I am about ready for bed here at around 8 pm. Geez. I am done with these drugs now, so waiting to see if the nausea will appear over the next few days or not. Fingers crossed that I will be in the clear!! But also wondering what other SE might be around the corner... Hope you all have an awesome day tomorrow.",

It has been great reading about everyone's experience here. I'm quite concerned about neuropathy, and iced my hands and feet during the treatment, but any other ideas to prevent this would be wonderful. I gave my self the Neulasta shot on Saturday night and the bone pain really kicked up last night. I've never had 'bone pain' so didn't quite know what to expect, but this is sure no fun! Also, a lot of abdominal pain and gripping. Anyone know if that is normal - perhaps a side effect of the docetaxal? Not sure, as this is all so new. Thanks! (and not sure why my profile data is not showing up, but I have ILC Stage 3a. ER/EP+, HER-. I had a unilateral mx Dec 6) ",

I know I am late to the table with comments about your doctor, but I wanted to add that I think trust and a good open relationship are so necessary to good health care. I had a great family doc from my late 20 to 39 - when she decided to retire her practice at the ripe old age of 40! I was devastated and then in family doc hell for the next 10 years or so. Went through 2 docs in 5 years, then had a different one for another 5 years who I never felt totally comfortable with but kept telling myself it was no big deal, and she was close and convenient... Until she put on a high dose of beta blockers for an emerging blood pressure issue when all I really needed was a low dose diuretic! I was in grad school at the time and the brain fog was ridiculous! I left after that and finally found a doc with great social skills and thorough care. What a relief! She also told me about 5 years ago that the standard of care in Canada for mammos had been revised to every 2 years, even though the clinic where I had them done continued to send me annual reminders. So, I revised to every 2nd year and of course did not go last year. I ask myself if, had I gone, my cancer would have been caught before it became Stage 3, which is what I now face. But, at the time it seemed reasonable and I didn't question this change, so I can't beat myself or my doc up about it. In your case, sounds like there may be other issues in the relationship and care that you question, and in the end that is what matters more than whether or not it was an oversight by your doc, seems to me. Re finding another one, I found that quite a challenge, and spent ages pouring over the \"doctors accepting new patients\" page on the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons, looking at their training (when/where) and trying to get a sense of their age - I didn't want someone fresh out of med school! I expect Ontario has similar listings. I finally found someone trained in South Africa who was in her late 30s/ early 40s and setting up a new practice in Calgary. Laura - so sorry to hear about your financial issues. What a crappy thing to have to deal with along with just handling treatment! Hope that gets sorted soon, one way or the other! Oleysa - good advice about the sedatives. I will take anything they offer! I still don't have a date though and my next chemo is tomorrow.... so obviously missed it for this round, which is a bummer! Your 2-yr sounds like quite the sweetie! Okkate - are we on the same schedule? You have your next round of chemo tomorrow too? Insideout2: You are so right! I feel like I am on a toggle board - ever trying to rebalance and accommodate to the next thing that comes up so I don't fall off in a heap. It is exhausting! But it is how I am fighting I think; trying to keep my spirits up, but feel the feelings so they will pass. This last week I have felt quite good, not emotional and clear-headed, with decent energy and getting some work done. Then 2 nights ago I woke in the night for 3 hours and couldn't get back to sleep. Clearly, my anxiety about tomorrow was turning up that way! And today, at a meditation/yoga class I attend that the psychosocial oncology resources unit runs, the facilatator read a poem and I just started crying. Whoa - did not expect that! But, it is all part of this. It is called \"Tea Ceremony\" and the last few lines are: This is your new life / Drink it in.",

I give myself the Neulasta injection the night of the day after treatment - so will be doing this shortly, as I had my second treatment yesterday. Last time the bone pain was severe so this will be an experiment to see if this helps. Can you try this? FaithWalker - I used the same ice booties that Shlomit used - first time yesterday with my second treatment. They were way easier to manage that the ice bags the chemo room provided. I bought 3 pairs and rotated them as they warmed up. There is a freezer at the hospital so we just kept them in there and my husband would switch them for me as needed. For my hands, I had some gel packs that had a little sleeve over them, so I put on surgical gloves for an extra layer and then just shoved my hands into the sleeve.

Hopeful Husband - I went out much of the time after treatment (when I wasn't feeling wiped our or sick of course!), and just carried some sanitary wipes with me.

Wow. Kudos to you all - you have a lot on your plates. I have just had a couple of really tough days that I hope are finally behind me. I have been having persistent abdominal pain ever since my first chemo on Jan 26. In the last couple of days this terrible gut pain escalated and referred/flared up on old lumbar spine issue, which in turn referred down my legs. Because of all this, I wasn't able to eat and experienced the most shocking weakness and fatigue ever in my life in the last couple of days. I could hardly lift my head; I thought I might pass out getting from the ensuite bathroom to my bed. Nausea turned up here and there as well. I have irritable bowel syndrome, which was always very minor, not a big thing in my life, but in the last several days it has just gone absolutely crazy - but it took me til Thursday to understand that this was what was the cause of my pain. With this being my first chemo so much is new and I didn't put it together. Turns out the SennaS I was diligently taking each night works by irritating the bowel. And the Docetaxal is also an irritant. This irritation is exactly NOT what I need, given the IBS. I was finally able to talk to my MO yesterday afternoon, and he's given me a drug for a few days that will calm the ongoing spasming that was happening all along the intestinal tract. I've known of these drugs for decades and that some people use them to manage IBS, but I've never wanted or needed them. That's sure changed! Hopefully, using this drug for a few days in each post-chemo week will keep this at bay. God, I sure hope so. Thanks to whoever suggested the pixie cut! I'm going to do that on Monday. ",

I had never questioned that I would see my daughter finish university, get out into the world, have kids (she's 21) or my oldest son finish grad school (he's 28) and also have kids. All of a sudden, I had to wonder: would I be around? We had to put our old dog down about a week before I started chemo, and I thought 'Am I the next one in the family who will be put down?'. I know its macabre, but this is what ran through the back of my mind. Okay, enough. Pity party over, but I know that how I know and define myself is never going to be the same after this - even when I get to 91 and have 1 year left! Imurphy - how are you doing? You are 2 days post-tx now?",

I am only 2 weeks past my first round (docetaxal) and between Tuesday and Thursday this week great gobs of my hair starting coming out! I am envious of those who made passed round 2 before they lost their hair! Anyway, I just shaved it off last night completely. The patchwork approach was too distressing. So, today was my first real wig day - I even wore it to the fitness testing for the Amber Research Study I signed up for. It feels weird, but I think looks quite like my own hair, so I guess I just have to live with that. I have a question for anyone who has, or considered getting a port. Are you glad you did it - did you have any complications? I have requested this, but I only have 5 treatments left (of 6 total). My hand was bruised for 2 weeks with the first infusion, and I thought to minimize this happening every time and also because my last 3 infusions will include the red devil (epirubicin), it might make the whole thing easier. Also, since I am icing, which is harder with the IV in my hand. Or - am I asking for trouble and should just accept I'll get a sore hand and get over it? Thoughts? I'd appreciate some guidance.

I know the ports make the infusions easier, but since it will only be used 5 times I am wondering if the tradeoff of having the insertion procedure and the discomfort (if there is any) of just having this extra thing on my chest is worthwhile for the added convenience. I had hoped it could also be used for blood draws (so several more uses) but the doc is saying \"they\" don't like to do that - ie, the nurses or whoever. I got the impression actually that it was time management thing more than a real practical reason why they wouldn't do this. Anyway, I am just questioning myself - am I being a prima dona for wanting this!? Also WorriedMe77, congrats on getting through your first chemo! I've only had one so far and sure was nervous the first round (my next round is in a week). Are you getting docetaxal for the first rounds? Did you remember to ice your hands?  ",

Roxy13 - Interesting what you say about the bruising and the nurse. Could certainly be the case. I am still waiting to hear when the insertion will be - just hope it is time enough to be there for my next infusion, which is this Friday. Keep us posted on the RADS info. And sorry to hear about the IUD story - sounds nasty! Krose53 - I don't enjoy the icing one bit! But, so far no neuropathy so I am going to persist as I figure I will really kick myself if I ended up with that and could have done something to prevent it.",

I am going to an info session on complementary therapies at my cancer centre on Wednesday so I will ask about this. Thanks for the encouragement about EC as I am getting nervous even thinking about it. I have a friend who did some rounds of FEC and found the nausea really hard. I don't have the F, but everything else! I already take a daily Nexium for reflux so ideally that will manage that potential side effect. My MO said he won't be giving me the Neulasta on the first round to see if my blood counts can manage on their own, even though I had this with each Docetaxal. Has anyone heard of this? Don't they just drop like a stone with the EC too? I asked my MO last time why I got the Docetaxal in the first half since most people I hear about have it in the second half of treatment, and he said there were a few studies that showed that having the EC first can sometimes cause resistance to the D \u2013 that it is less effective AFTER than before. I have ILC though, so maybe this is a thing with lobular that is different than the ductal cancers? Re hair loss and docetaxal, it started coming out in handfuls 10 days after my first treatment. I remember being shocked at the speed with which this happened as I thought I'd have a few more weeks. However, the situation now is that I have light scattered stubble on my head: (which I shave as it is annoying under my wig); in other words, there was not TOTAL hair loss. I am expecting this will all disappear with the upcoming EC though (I understand the C is the real culprit). It induces a billiard ball effect someone said, haha. As for eyelashes and eyebrows, I've attached a pic- I just have mascara on (else my lashes would be too light to really show up), but nothing at all on my eyebrows. I just expected everything to go, so am really happy that I kept them. I should add that I've been using the liposil products for the last month or more, which I read about on a UK cancer blog. It's hard to know if this is what made the difference but I thought it didn't hurt to try these \u2013 I got both the lash and the brow product. https://www.google.ca/search?q=liposils&rlz=1C1CHZL_enCA719CA719&oq=liposils&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1678j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 I still have the peachfuzz hair on my arms, and some scattered coverage in the nether regions. My nails have been fine. Paisley\u2014 I also iced and am glad I did, even though it was real pain at the time. But if I'd ended up with neuropathy (which I haven't) and didn't try this I know I would have really been kicking myself. I also took B6 and Magnesium which is supposed to support nerve function. I used iced gel packs with my hands and these iced booties on my feet: https://www.amazon.com/NatraCure-Cold-Therapy-Socks-treatment/dp/B003L4WOKG?th=1 Olesya\u2014 Hope you are doing better now!

Now, two days into wearing a wig each day, it doesn't bother me so much. This cancer experience sure does ask a lot of us - so much to accommodate to, it seems it never ends sometimes! AND, thanks for backing up my desire/decision to have the port. All this feedback makes me feel like I was not out of line to request this, even though my MO said I didn't need it at all. He said the nurses would \"love\" my veins. Of course, this doesn't account for my NOT loving that the nurses will love them! And having a bruised hand for 2 weeks is not what I want either. WorriedMe77 - If you are getting a cocktail and not just docetaxal alone, neuropathy may not be such a risk for you. And I get what you mean about being cold. I found it quite a challenge to have both hands and feet in ice for more than an hour - but I am super keen to avoid neuropathy so it was more important for me to tough that out, especially as this drug is known to cause this fairly often I understand.

Any advice for me on what to expect overall would sure be helpful. Re my taxane drug - Overall, the worst SE for me has been fatigue and feeling extremely cold for several days starting about day 4. I still can't figure out though if this is from the Neulasta (which also brings a bunch of bone and muscle pain) or from the docetaxal. Someone suggested to me yesterday that with the red blood cell count low, there is less oxygen circulating and so this might be from that. I have tried all kinds of things to deal with it, but it just keeps happening and destroying my sleep. I couldn't sleep til 430am last night. Sigh! I also had intermittent diarrhea with the docetaxal but nothing unmanageable. And got oral thrush, which is annoying but easily treated with a mouth rinse. As for neuropathy, I iced hands and feet every time, which I did find a real challenge, but please be careful not to give yourself frostbite! I did that this last time, which has been stupid and bothersome! Also, I take magnesium bisgluconate (250 mg AM + PM), B6 (100mg AM + PM) and calcium (350mg AM + PM) also to stave off neuropathy too. They are supposed to preserve nerve function. I believe it is working. I was told NOT to take any fish oils during chemo treatment as they are Antioxidants and therefore interfere with the effectiveness of the chemo drugs. I highly recommend the frozen booties you can find on Amazon for the feet. And I used frozen gel packs for my hands too, which were easier than ice for me. Just remember to put 1 good layer between the frozen pack and your skin. We brought 3 sets and rotated about every 20 - 30 minutes, keeping the alternate sets in a freezer in the chemo room. Olesya - love all your RED! Roxy - what a fun looking book! I remember those days of worrying about unattended kids!

And another one that is an OTC supplement called Glutothione (also found in several food sources) She also highly recommends the Sloan-Kettering alternative medicine database as a reliable and up to date resource. https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatm... She also mentioned an affiliated app, \"About Herbs\" but I couldn't find it for android, so perhaps it is just available for Iphones.. anyway, the same S-K info there. So, fish oils are OK! She also said that the latest research shows that soy and flax are also okay! They, in fact, block the uptake of estrogen into estrogen-sensitive cancer cells, rather than feeding them - which is what had previously been thought about the phytoestrogens in these foods. Again, surprising info! The speaker is affiliated with my local cancer centre and she and her students have done several lit reviews looking at the data on all kinds of products - they looked at 959 studies (though this might be a few years old now). Anyway, overall, a really interesting session. D-L ",
