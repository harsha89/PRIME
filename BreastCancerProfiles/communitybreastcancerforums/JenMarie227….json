I went Thursday for a routine gyn appt and she seemed quite worried about the lump. It's firm, fixed and close to the surface. She said I have an enlarged lymph node and she wants me to see a surgeon. My appt is 3/12 and Im a mess. My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer about 3 yrs ago and that scares me even more. I have 3 daughters and husband but I don't want to worry them so here I am venting. I cant help but think the worst. Thanks for listening.",

I just feel like I've been worried enough for the both of us. Patience is not one of my stronger traits :) Thanks",
