Though I don't have breast cancer, my dad has BRCA2 linked prostate cancer and we are looking at options. I want to share something that may be relevant to your community given the information posted in this thread. In our family, the pattern in similar to the story posted - lots of boys in the last generation and before so BRCA2 was not obvious. But high rates of prostate and bowel cancer became evident in the last few years. That all these boys carried BRCA2 was picked up only because of some great work by a genetic cancers database here in Australia. Turns out some distant relatives we didn't know tested positive to BRCA had put details on the register. When the prostate cancer in my dad was diagnosed we were linked with the registry and we found he tested positive. This caused a chain reaction, with many young women in the next generation being tested and testing positive. Probably, finding this out has saved the lives of many of my relatives who never otherwise would have had any idea they were at increased risk of bc and oc. Now they can do proper monitoring and take other steps if they want to. The message, I guess - if you have high rates of prostate cancer if your family, and a lot of boys in preceding generations, it may be worth wondering about the presence of BRCA. It matters now given that treatments are becoming much more targeted. Sorry to but in to your discussion, but perhaps this information will help someone.",
