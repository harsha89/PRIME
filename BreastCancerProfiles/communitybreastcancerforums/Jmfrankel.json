You asked a question about having a port and whether it was being removed before surgery. I do have a port and will not get it removed because like you I am HER2+ and will be on Herceptin for a year which they infuse though my port. I haven't had too much discomfort with the port but am worried that the surgery may jostle it a bit out of place where it may hurt. We'll see. -Joan",

Maybe rosebuds can speak to you about how she feels now after recon...I think she mentioned hers was delayed as well. Allebasi...we are all here to support each other so don't worry about all the questions. 1. My surgery was the 6th and I still have no desire to leave the house. Doctor's appts are enough. But I will say I live in MN and it is 15 degrees so not sure anyone wants to get out these days. I do lay around the house a lot. 2. I also have very little appetite but I think this is explained by 1 because I am not burning any calories sleeping all day. Haven't even had much desire for sweets which is good. Eat small meals and healthy snacks like yogurt or a clementine. 3. I have been showering since 6 days after surgery when they pulled the drains but I have some sort of super adhesive tape over incisions that doesn't come off...which by the way worries me when it is time for it to come off...ouch. Eanemaet, robsp, and gtgirl....glad your surgeries went well. Take care and rest! I also have a couple of questions of my own...1. what type of support are you using on the chest? 2. Do you wear support at night as well? I have just been wearing camisoles with a shelf bra but suspect this is not enough support. I wore a tight one yesterday and actually felt better but it was way too tight to wear to bed. I tried sleeping without anything and that was awful. Any recommendations? Looking on amazon for maybe a zip up sports bra but want super soft material like my camisoles since wearing them 24/7 irritates my skin.",

The beds there make it a bit easier getting in and out of the bed. Keets858, I was so sorry to read about your son passing at such an early age. I can't imagine that kind of grief. When I feel horrible about my situation of having cancer I thank God it is not one of my kids. I would take this anyday over having to have a child suffer. I pray for you and am so glad your pathology report looked good. Unfortunately we never know what we are going to be dealt with in life and sometimes it doesn't seem fair. The only thing we can do is fight to be survivors and appreciate the good things we do have in life. Emotionally this is tough to deal with. I have had days where I broke down crying at work. My job is stressful and sometimes I never found the time to reflect on the whole situation. Right now I plan on taking the rest of the year off to recuperate and heal both physically and mentally. I did have a bit of good news yesterday though...I got my drain tubes out! Had 3 of them but hardly had much output from them. I was very scared going into the doc's office because I knew they were going to remove them and I have been so sore I thought it would be really painful. It wasn't too bad at all (it helps if you don't watch). The nurse and doctor worked on both sides at once removing both the tegaderm wrap and tubes. Now I only have steristrip tape over the incisions. I am allowed to shower today and can't wait but will definitely be careful. Haven't received a full pathology report yet but from conversation with my surgeon I know I had cancer in 4 of 8 nodes on left and none on right. This was not a total surprise because they could see the cancer in my nodes on the MRI. I have already done my chemo but will also need radiation. Just looking at the list of surgeries and it looks like cjklose and sallys70 have their procedures today. We will keep you both in our prayers. Let us know how it goes. Stay strong!",

At first it felt like a simple flu shot but then they inject a little deeper and it hurts a tad more for a few seconds. I just squeezed a nurses hand and it was ok. I didn't realize the shot was in the areola until they did it so it freaked me out a bit when I got there. Wish I had known ahead of time. Just part of what we have to go through.

He explained so much and alleviated some of my fears of radiation. Allebasi..I would ask the PS about tearing from fills. Not sure if this can happen but I have heard about tearing after radiation. I have had 2 fills now (up to 300 cc total) but haven't had extreme tightness because I think they left a decent amount of skin in place. Taking lots of vallium though between the fills and the stretching from the PT. I admire you for doing natural childbirth 5 times! With my two I got an epidural before they even induced.",

I also use a heating pad on back to relax tensed up muscles. My addition to warn everyone is to pay close attention to any leg pain even minor cramp can be a blood clot. It is easy enough test for them to check if you do suspect one (simple ultrasound). I think some receive shots in hospital and some do not. I had two lovenex in hospital and those compression leg things but still got a clot. Allebasi...thanks for the tips about the shots. The shots aren't too bad but do sting a good while. I told my husband last night that it didn't hurt the first time he gave me the shot and I think it was because he gave it slower the first time because he was so freaked out. Hoping we can stop shots on Monday after I get my next INR reading. Robinlk, glad to hear you got drains and pump out. What a relief. Sorry to hear about your naval ring. I can totally relate to feeling bad because it's the feeling like we just can't have our normal lives back.

How long do you need to be on lovenex? Are you on the lovenex from a previous blood clot? I also found somewhere that the vein itself could have a clot in it as well. I would recommend seeing a doc...either your general surgeon, PS, or oncologist. Perhaps they coud ultrasound the vein to make sure it is not a clot. Lms0139.. So sorry to hear about losing your TE.

The right side couldn't be biopsied with ultrasound because it could only be seen on MRI. Since I decided on the BMX they didn't push to do an MRI biopsy. I have been tested for brca1 and 2 but turned up negative. Can't wait to be done. A bit worried about infection but plan on sanitizing my house, clothes, sheets, etc. the day before. Did everyone else get instructions on showering with hibicleans the night before and morning of surgery? I got very specific instructions on showering then using clean towel, pjs, sheets, and clothes the next day. Hoping all this thoroughness helps.

Feeling better now...I think it was the percosets that did it but boy I miss the pain relief from them. Very sore now but pain is tolerable. I may try a new drug after breakfast that is a narcotic but not as strong as percosets. Other option would be to try just 1 percosets vs 2. My drains aren't giving me any problems. Have 2 on the left and 1 on the right. The first night the nurse stripped them and I felt a little pain but not bad. Now I feel nothing. I think they won't be too bad to manage at home. As for incisions, I thought I would be wrapped up in some sort of ace bandage but I am not. I think I just have tegaderm across my whole chest so you can see the scars and all. A lot of what I read before surgery said it would feel like heavy weights on your chest but I don't feel that. It just feels like I did about 1000 push ups and my muscles and ribs are sore. No incision pain whatsoever. Also I read that drinking cold liquids would feel funny too but I haven't experienced that. To all awaiting surgery ..try not to be too worried. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I had previous surgery on my appendix and had level 10 pain coming out of that. I mentioned this to the docs and they made sure when I came out of surgery I would not be in that much pain... Was probably a 3 or 4 this time. P.s.

They said I could get an MRI biopsy on the right one too but since I was getting a BMX they said I didn't need it. Now after thinking about it a bit, the only reason I could see them wanting to biopsy your left side would be for treatment purposes. You didn't mention in your tag line whether your right breast cancer was HER2+. If it was not but your left breast did have cancer then they would want to know if the left breast cancer was HER2 because then they would add Herceptin to your treatment. In my case I was already HER2 so finding out about my right breast cancer type wouldn't make a difference for my treatment. Does this make sense?",

I had neoadjuvent chemo as well and just had my BMX last week. I think waiting (since may) for surgery was the hard part. Are you having any reconstruction at the same time? Welcome to mommy 13 as well. It continually amazes me how many of us are getting surgery this month. Mimi32 had a list going at the top of the thread but just had her surgery this week so it may be awhile before she can add you to the list. For those of you who had surgery last week...how many of you are still on pain meds? I continue to take them 4x a day and can't seem to be able to do without them. Wondering if this is normal. I am pretty sensitive to pain but am really getting tired of taking the drugs. They make me sleep all day. Most of my pain is in my armpits (I had SND on both sides and AND on left but strangely the rt side hurts more).",

My surgery was at 11 but I did't come out until about 4:30 and then was in recovery until about 6:30. Pain wasn't too bad at first but as the night went on I needed more narcotic which unfortunately made me very nautious and I almost threw up. Stopped narcotics overnight but then by 8:00 was in quite a bit of pain (7 or 8 on pain scale). At that point they gave me 2 Percocet, 1vallium, and 2 other drugs I can't remember. It knocked me out for 4 hours but again made me nautious and almost threw up the few bites of lunch I had. Finally I said no more narcotics and am only on Valium and toradol with two different kinds of antinausia. I was able to eat a decent amount of food for dinner and am in a little bit more of pain but it is tolerable. Walking round ok now too and plan on going home tomorrow. Just glad it's over. Took a peak at incisions which look bad but not too bad considering what they did. My TEs have little humps at about a size A cup now. Hoping things look better once the swelling goes down. Mimi68, teachingwithcancer, and lana830, hope your surgeries went well today. Rosebuds hope your surgery goes well tomorrow. Keep in touch and good luck. -joan",

Yesterday I took quite a bit of vallium because of pretty bad muscle spasms but the drugs didn't seem to make me more tired. The thing that gets me mad is I just looked up the name of my medicine online (tramadol) and it says this drug should not be taken with vallium because it can cause seizures! The hospital prescribed both along with percoset although I can't tolerate those much. I have been taking both the tramadol and vallium together for the last 10 days. Ugh. Sometimes I wonder if the pharmacists know anything. Decided I am now quitting tramadol altogether and will try to manage with motrin and vallium. Things have been better today but still a ton of swelling in the armpits. I have been using a heating pad on my back and ice packs on my breast and armpits. Tired of the pain and have to go get a fill next Monday. Hopefully I can get through it without too much pain. Sorry to ramble.",

I am having my surgery nov 6 so I may be the first this month. The waiting has been mentally painful. I have known since May I would need surgery but did chemo first. So happy I did the chemo first because now they can't see anything in my breasts on an MRI except one small dot. I had two very large tumors in my left breast and a small spot on my right which we didn't biopsy because I had decided to do BMX and they couldn't see on an ultrasound to biopsy. I could have had MRI biopsy but decided to just take both. I am having TEs too even though my future holds rads. I saw the PS once in July and have another appt on Monday with him to talk sizing. I have always been very big DD and can't wait to go smaller. I am thinking C but wondering if that may be too big since I will have radiated breasts. I guess I'll find out what PS says Mon. Glad to have company but sad we all have to go through this.",

Met with him again yesterday and feel a little left in the dark. I am getting TEs followed by implants. I feel like I am not part of any decisions at this point. Perhaps that comes later but I thought you had to have the implant picked out to choose appropriate TE. I guess i need to post in reconstruction forum too. Nancyjeanne: do you have a date for surgery yet? Mimi32 and CJKlose: sounds like you two are also getting TEs. How has your interaction with your PS gone? Mine seems to think that my decisions come later. He is putting in a mentor implant, moderate I believe, size 450 cc. I am hoping for large B or small C.

Had my own room although it was pretty much the size of a closet and could only fit 2 visitors at a time. The IV meds definitely worked better than the oral ones. Keep taking them though...I am still on them and it has been 8 days now. It is good you have your daughter to help. Some things that helped me were a heating pad on my back and light message there too since the pain makes all your muscles tense up. I tried ice packs initially on my front but it was too heavy and painful. Now the small ones seem to do ok under the arm pits. If your daughter can get you one of those travel neck pillows they are wonderful. Makes it much easier to sleep sitting up. Sorry to get long winded here but there are so many things they do in the hospital that you might forget at home like taking a stool softener too. The pain meds will really slow down everything. I ended up taking 2 a day before things got moving 6 days out. Get plenty of rest and lots of water. I think at times I slept 16 hours a day the first few days. Cjklose, sorry your surgery got delayed. Better safe then sorry though with the infection. Tae,it is hard to imagine ourselves after surgery with or without reconstruction. It just isn't the same. I know this sounds weird but I tried to prepare myself ahead of time by looking at some of the plastic surgeon websites pictures so I could be prepared. It is kind of scary but then you realize you as a person will be the same. The important thing is fighting the cancer and getting healthy. There may be some other forums on this website that may help you. I would search under IBC forums (am I correct in assuming this is inflammatory BC? I am not up on all the acronyms)",

Yesterday I had an appt with my mo and my husband nudged me to remind me to ask her about my leg pain. On Monday I woke up from a nap with some serious leg pain in my left calf. I could hardly walk on it at the time but by Tuesday it went away. So I mentioned it and she looked at my legs and could tell one felt hotter than the other and immediately sent me to the hospital for an ultrasound because of a suspected blood clot. Turns out I did have a clot the distance of 2 inches. Luckily it is not in a main artery but they sent me to the ER immediately. They gave me a lovenex shot in the stomach and showed my husband how to administer these because he is going to have to give me these shots 2x a day for possibly a week. I am waiting right now to get an appt back with my mo doc to find out next steps. Most likely I will come in to get my blood tested (I think it is called an INR) so they can start me on Coumadin. I just can't believe this. I almost dismissed the previous pain even though my family has a history of blood clots. I think I mentioned in a previous post that I had a sister who died from a blood clot that moved to her lungs and essentially didn't allow her to get enough oxygen. My mom and sisters have a gene that predisposes them to clots but I had been tested with both my pregnancies and they said I did not have the gene. I guess I will be getting retested on that front as well. Other than that things are ok. Tried to go off the pain meds but can not. Too much pain today in my armpits from the SNB and ANB. TEs actually don't hurt so that's an upside:). I suppose they will be changing what I can take as well. I'll keep you posted.",

My path came back with 4 of 8 having cancer. I guess it didn't phase me too much because they had already told me I would need radiation. As for the drugs I am glad you are able to cut back some. I tried this week and had a lot of pain and had to start them up again. Had long discussion about tramadol and any worries I had about mixing with vallium are gone. My BS today said that tramadol is what they like to put people on if they will be taking the drugs for awhile since it isn't really a narcotic but tricks your brain that it is. (probably not explaining it right). He said it was less addicting. Since I have most of my pain at night I am trying to reduce amounts during the day and taking a dose before bed. It hasn't made me sleepy lately or see weird things either. To everyone else on this forum I am sorry I haven't been keeping up with the surgeries. Hoping everone's have been going well. Congratulations to those getting drains out even if it is just a few. Also congrates to those finally getting surgery dates...waiting is the hardest. Last update from my blod clot saga is I am now on Coumadin. Stomach shots going well and not too painful either. BS says he doesn't think it will slow my healing. That's about it. -Joan",

Everyone...I think vallium is mostly prescribed when you get tissue expanders because the chest muscles spasm. It works great at relaxing the muscles! It's my favorite of all the drugs Aeryno..glad you had no cancer in nodes. Sounds like your procedure went really well. Allebasi...so sorry you had pain when they took your drains out. I had 3 and had some minor discomfort but certainly not that bad. I have a low tolerance for pain so I am wondering if they did something different procedurally with you like placement of the drains. Perhaps they were near areas that hadn't had nerve endings cut. I did take a percoset before I went to get the drains removed so maybe that is what saved me. I think when I go for a fill I'll take a percoset too.",

I was told to do some exercises where I walk slowly up the wall with my arms for 10 reps 4x per day. Interesting that when I asked at the hospital about exercises they gave me nothing.

I am slowly recovering and finally doing the exercises the PT gave me several times a day but I think the exercises also contribute to more of my pain since I am stretching the muscles more. The PT thinks I should be on the vallium around the clock. Maybe that's because my muscles were so tight I could barely do the exercises. So starting yesterday I have been taking a vallium every 6 hours. It does seem to have helped and I am continuing today but will ask the PS what he thinks tomorrow. I need to get my range of motion back since I will need radiation too. I still have a decent amount of swelling under the armpits. Bought some genie bras like others have mentioned and that seems to add the compression I need without irritating the skin under my arms. Note though these are not for use with drains...AnnieeC. Not sure what you can do with the drains other than the surgical bra they gave you. I have been icing my armpit and breasts as much as possible and PT recommended that too. It does help. Allebasi, you mentioned you need radiation too. How long are they letting you wait before starting? I see a radiation oncologist this Friday and I am hoping he doesn't have a problem with me finishing my TE fills prior to starting. That is what the PS wants and me too. I guess it doesn't matter what the RO thinks at this point much since I can't lift my arms enough for radiation anyhow. Thanks everyone for listening and commenting. It does help to have you gals!",

Bec65...your mesh thing is sometimes called a bolus.  I had one as well but mine was more like a flexible mat.  I had to wear my bolus for every treatment so not sure what the rationale is for having some treatments with it off.  I think someone else mentioned above but I will repeat that the bolus basically just makes it so that when the beam hits your skin it is at full power.  I was told that normally when it hits the skin it is at 60-70%.  Now it will be at this level when it hits the bolus but by the time the beam gets through the bolus and hits the skin it will be at 100%.  Hope this explanation helps. ",

Maybe not as big of a concern since my right won't be getting the rads but I don't want scar tissue to buildup so much that the PS has to go into surgery to release the scar tissue so expansion can continue after a long delay. ",

This weekend I officially turned red all over (15/28 done).  The small patch that turned red after 10 days has actually gotten better with the steroid cream or perhaps it just looks better compared to the rest of my red chest and neck. What is really strange is I got a big red patch that appeared on my left arm ( neither on the tricep side or bicep side but in between).  It's in a place that shoudn't be getting any radiation and in fact is probably leaning in the mold every day.  Can't explain this one but I think I will ask tomorrow.  ",

That was er visit 1 on Wednesday night.  Thursday my fevers were 102-104 at home and uncontrollable which led to er visit 2 and being hospitalized. They suspected bacterial in nature because of high temps and started me on 4 different Iv antibiotics (luckily I still have my port) but are now relooking at it being viral and are doing a recheck of flu with a more accurate test.  A lot of info and I don't want this to get too long. Moral of story is that we are just as susceptible during rads as chemo but in different ways.  For me it is a loss of platelets.  I wish my mo had warned me to stay away from infectious areas like work, malls etc.  I didn't know what having low platelets meant in terms of risk. I'll keep you posted when they figure this mess out. - Joan",

She said they only gve them out at the doctor's office.  She said there is a special online at amazon right now for 4 tubes for $100 I think?  Not sure I want to buy 4 tubes until I try 1 but their stuff sounds pretty good.  Interested to hear if anyone is using this yet.  ",

Lizzie, keep us posted on how your short protocol goes.  Personally I would be a bit scared just with the intentsity of it.  I will be curious how it goes. Rlsteadman and Miminiemi,  congrats in advance for tomorrow's big day.  We would have all been finishing the same day had my rads not been interrupted:(.  Today I got a call from the rad nurse wanting me to start rads back up today!  I just got out of the frickin hospital yesterday,  I am still contagious for 5 more days, and oh I have about another 7-8 lbs of water weight to lose since they pumped me up with steroids and IV fluids (20 lbs worth)....do you think all this water might effect the simulation or even how the radiation works?  Jeez...not to mention my hemoglobin is 7.8.  Sorry I had to rant.  I calmly told her that all my water weight may impact the rads and my blood counts were still low and I wasnt doing anything until my MO and RO discussed.  My MO called later and said I wasn't doing anything for another week, including my Herceptin treatment which was scheduled for today too...oops I forgot to cancel.  So I sit and wait.  My skin continues to heal and I continue with my creams. To add to the discussion about weight above and whether it is important I would say yes.  I had BMX and TEs and my breasts look different with my added weight.  Very weird...I guess it is more of the fatty tissue (dog ears) part that has changed with the water.",

Jp and  checkers congrats on finishing.  Today would have been my last day but my RO added two extra days since I missed 6 days in a row due to illness.  I guess I will be done Monday.   I have not had any underarm hair growth since chemo so I haven't needed to shave.  Haven't used deodorant either since my surgery in November which is amazing.  Not sure I can pull that off in the summer but so far so good...no sweat.   My son had his 8th b-day and we tried to make it as normal as possible.  Hard to believe how fast they grow up! Goodnight everyone. ",
