I always read every single bit of it, including every single link you provide. It is so very helpful and I appreciate it!! I am going to call Agendia to ask about the risk recurrence, and what type of \"recurrence\" estimate it is. Is it a measure of distant recurrence risk or any recurrence? I will ask my MO as well. I will also ask Agendia and my MO whether the dots on my risk summary page are MY personalized results, and what that means regarding my risk. (~18% and ~23%.) (I have spoken previously to the doctor at Agendia and she is very approachable and helpful.) << You can ask your MO if the Oncotype risk information from the first graph of your Oncotype report (with Tam Alone) is still a suitable estimate of your 10-year risk of distant recurrence with endocrine therapy alone, or does information from the MammaPrint and/or BluePrint test alter understanding of your distant recurrence risk with endocrine therapy alone? (AIs are comparable or slightly more effective than Tamoxifen.) >> I had asked that question, after he was completely willing to toss the oncotype results out the window, and just rely on the MammaPrint. His answer was: We now have new additional information that we can't ignore. I have shown both MO all the literature, the NEJM, the JOCO articles, etc, where is says the MammaPrint should not be done in my situation. (recommendation 1.1.2). << This article was published in 2008, before the 2013 publication of RASTER and well before the 2016 publication of MINDACT which included a large number of patients. Please ask your MO whether the observations in this early paper appear to be borne out in the older, post-menopausal patients in subsequent trials, such as RASTER or MINDACT. >> Do you have links to these RASTER or MINDACT trials/publications? Unfortunately, the results of the MINDACT/MammaPrint seem to only address the three other groups, under which I do not fall: Low clinical / low genomic ---> no chemo High clinical / high genomic ---> chemo could benefit High clinical / low genomic ---> can possibly avoid chemo But they were underpowered to answer whether chemo would benefit the discordant group. (My situation: Low clinical / high genomic.) MINDACT was not powered to answer whether chemotherapy benefited the patients in the discordant groups. In the intent-to-treat analysis, for the c-High/g-Low group, distant metastasis\u2013free survival was 95.9% with chemotherapy and 94.4% without (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78, P = .267). For the c-Low/g-High patients, distant metastasis\u2013free survival rates were 95.8% and 95.0%, respectively (HR = 1.17, P = .657). ",

I realize that a score of 21 is in the intermediate area on the oncotype, however two oncologists both recommended no chemo based on the results. Said I was low clinical risk, ER+, negative nodes, tumor under 2cm, HER2 negative, so they felt it wasn't worth the toxicity of the chemo. But then when the onco called me back with the results of the MammaPrint, (which, by the way, I was the one who asked for that test, not the onco), he said the results were discordant because the MP showed high risk. But if you read: http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2017.74.0... Journal of clinical oncology - Use of Biomarkers Aug 2017 it specifically says that if you are low clinical risk, the MammaPrint should not be used.

Negative nodes, 1.9 cm tumor. I understand what you are saying, that, due to my high risk MammaPrint, (minus 0.090), my BluePrint output of Luminal, automatically becomes Luminal B. And I will definitely ask my onco this again, according to your suggestion: << In connection with weighing the risks and benefits, if you have not received an estimate of the potential benefit of chemotherapy in your case, you may wish to ask if one can be provided (and how it is determined). If the size of the potential benefit is unclear, you may wish to ask your MO for their current best estimate of your 5-year or 10-year distant recurrence risk with an AI alone (and ask how it is determined). The potential benefit of added chemotherapy in reducing that distant recurrence risk is some fraction thereof and by definition less than that risk. How does it compare to the incidence of severe adverse events seen with CMF? >> But when I had mentioned it previously, they said they want to achieve that 94.6% DMFI (distant metastasis free in 5 years), which shows on the MammaPrint page 1, as the benefits with chemo AND hormone. Everyone who achieves a high risk MP score is 29% high risk without ANY treatment, (as per pg 1 of MP results), and everyone has that same 94.6% DMFI at 5 years with chemo and hormone. So I guess what it is saying that WITHOUT ANY TREATMENT, there is only a 71% chance of living without a distant metastasis, but adding chemo and hormone brings it to 94.6%. But nowhere has it been studied (by Agendia), to see results with just hormone, and over 10 year period, rather than five. I asked the MO what the risk would be with AI alone, and he said it is unclear. I am guessing perhaps somewhere between the 71% and 94.6%. Or I could be wrong, and it might be a greater benefit from the AI over 10 years. I remember at the beginning, when both MO were saying no chemo due to the Oncotype RS (21), and they both said Lobular responds very well to hormone therapy. But I will definitely ask again as per your suggestions above. (Although I guess the potential benefit with chemo would be that 94.6%?). I guess bottom line is I have to try and find out what my % recurrence risk would be with hormone alone, but none of them were able to say. On a side note, I tried attaching the picture of my actual results, but when I tried to post, it said \"you are not allowed to post links at this time. I have no idea why it wouldn't allow me to post those images. Any idea? ",

If so, were you pointed to a published study that demonstrates such differences? >> When I asked if everyone's recurrence risk was different, based on their actual \"High Risk\" value, I was told that the average is still 29%, as a result of the study, but that someone with a MP value closer to 0.0, (compared to closer to the -1.0), will have slightly less recurrence risk. For example, my score of -.090 will have an 18% 5yr recurrence risk, (according to where the dots fall), whereas someone with -.350 or closer to -1.0, may have a larger than 29% risk, but according to the study, everyone in the high risk group has 29% on their summary report as per Agendia, even though the dots are positioned differently, based on individual scores. I was not pointed to a published study that demonstrates that difference. I can reach back out to Agendia to inquire. Thank you again for your tremendous amount of help.",

She even sent me a followup email to bring to my doctor, showing the study results, as they applied to my situation. I learned, like you, that for me, being at low clinical/high genomic, also age 66, the risk factors of chemo outweighed the benefits, which were perhaps 2%. She even shared her opinion with me regarding the chemo. I am glad to hear you didn't just accept your BS recommendation for chemo without questioning what would be best for you. I also fear recurrence, but even my onco said that even with chemo, there are no guarantees. It will be a fear that I will live with everyday. But I eat healthy, I will get back to exercise as soon as I complete healing from the double mastectomy, and I am taking Anastrozole. I hope that will be enough. Had you also gone to a medical oncologist to discuss your options? I am so thankful for this board and all the knowledgeable people who are so helpful and willing to share their information. Bottom line, you have to be your own advocate, and make whatever decision is best for you.",

I have read most of them, especially the NEMJ article on the MammaPrint. I am in the ''low clinical risk/high genomic risk'' category. From what I read in the NEMJ, if I understand it correctly, it says: \"Among patients at low clinical risk and high genomic risk, those who underwent randomization on the basis of genomic risk (and therefore received chemotherapy) had a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis of 95.8% (95% CI, 92.9 to 97.6), as compared with a rate of 95.0% (95% CI, 91.8 to 97.0%) among those who underwent randomization on the basis of clinical risk (and therefore received no chemotherapy) (adjusted hazard ratio for distant metastasis or death with chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.28; P = 0.66) (Fig. 2B). This finding does not show any advantage of directing therapy on the basis of genomic risk among patients at low clinical risk but high genomic risk, since these patients had no benefit from the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, among patients in the discordant risk groups, there was no significant difference between the chemotherapy group and the no chemotherapy group with respect to disease-free survival (Fig. 2C and 2D) and overall survival (Fig. 2E and 2F). Sensitivity analyses in the perprotocol population are provided in Table 2. Data regarding intervals without distant metastasis are shown in Figure S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.\" In the final discussion, it also states, : \"Some 50% of the study patients were defined as being at low clinical risk. In this group, we did not find any meaningful difference in the 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis between patients at high genomic risk who received chemotherapy and those who did not receive chemotherapy. On the basis of these data, the results for the 70-gene signature do not provide evidence for making recommendations regarding chemotherapy for patients at low clinical risk. In clinical practice, genomic testing is best used in combination with clinical\u2013pathological factors, since the gene signature has an added and independent prognostic value.\" So am I correct in concluding that in my situation, chemo would not be helpful? I am low clinical risk. ER+, HER2-, tumor under 2CM, Negative nodes, bilateral mastectomy, June 2017. Also negative on all the genes tested in the Myriad 'MY RISK' genetic testing. My oncotype result was 21. (Very low in the intermediate category). Based on my oncotype results and my low clinical risk, my medical oncologist had originally recommended only Aromitase inhibitor. (I am post menopausal). However, after receiving the results of the MammaPrint, showing \"high risk\", and Luminal B, he is now recommending chemo. Going for 2nd opinion next week. Any opinions or feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

If I don't do chemo, I don't want to kick myself down the road if I get distant metastasis (which is why the oncos recommended chemo), but I also do not want to put myself thru unnecessary chemo and toxicity. And the thought of hair loss when the chemo may not even be necessary, really sends me into a depression. They said they would give me a very \"mild chemo\", (if there is any such thing!) CMF is what I would get, every two weeks, 8 treatments total, with a booster shot the day after each treatment. They claim hair loss wouldn't be \"that great\", (compared to some other regiments), but there would still be thinning, and suggested the Penquin cold cap. Wish I knew more about CMF. And I really wish I knew what to do. I have two oncos recommending chemo, but my gut is telling me it may not be needed. I have done so much research, my head is spinning. I haven't slept in weeks. I don't know what to do :-(",

I have no idea why it wouldnt allow me to post those images. << From your post - BluePrint Luminal-type and MammaPrint High Risk ==> Luminal-type (B)-like >> I understand what you are saying regarding the Low Clinical/High genomic risk that MINDACT hasn't really addressed. If you are low clinical/low geneomic, then no chemo. If you are high clinical/low genomic, also no chemo. And obviously high/clinical/high genomic would benefit from chemo simply based on the high clinical (now reinforced high genomic). This is why I am at such a gut-wrenching place in deciding whether to do the chemo, (CMF was recommended). If I had positive nodes, or a larger tumor, or other unfavorable aspects, then it would be a no brainer, I would do the chemo. But not being sure if any benefits would be derived from chemo, in my situation, I am at a loss. The only explanation given to me is that Luminal B, MAY be a little more aggressive. But from everything I know, and have read, chemo itself can be worse, can cause future cancers, can make cancer cells more resistant, can cause permanent cognitive issues, aside form all the side effects while going through treatment. My summary page(exactly as you have shown in your post) showed DFMI of 94.6 benefit with Chemo AND hormone therapy. One of the drawbacks in this study, is that they did not test to see what benefits would be obtained with hormone therapy alone. Even the doctor at Agendia with whom I spoke, said that was a major problem. I am on the Arimidex, and have no way of knowing if it will be enough to limit my risk of mets. According the my RS of 21 on oncotype Dx, no chemo was recommended (only hormone therapy), by ANY oncologist. I wish I could just 'UNSEE\" the mammaprint results and just rely on the Oncotype!!! ** Can you please explain a little further, what you mean by what you wrote: << Regarding \"clinical risk\", please also note that that High Risk Luminal-Type (B) Summary Pages include a \"double-cross\" footnote which indicates that certain patients categorized as \"Clinical Low Risk\" per MINDACT criteria would be deemed high risk clinically under some consensus guidelines: C-low Comprehensive Consensus Guidelines may differ and categorize a patient with these clinical factors as high risk. The above observations may help explain in part the advice you received. Also, the advice received would not be based on the MammaPrint result alone, but a synthesis of all relevant information including those results in light of clinical and pathologic factors and Oncotype results as well. >> ** How do I find out if I fall into that category of being deemed clinically high risk? ----------------------- As far as the oncotype, both oncos are now completely disregarding the Oncotype results, in favor of the MammaPrint, due to its results of high genomic risk. They are also discounting my positive prognostics of no lymph nodes, ER+, HER2-, tumor size 1.9cm, along with double mastectomy. I did show the oncologist all my printed material from the NEJM, and from Journal of clinical oncology, along with several other recommendations, as mentioned in my very first post: \"Among patients at low clinical risk and high genomic risk, those who underwent randomization on the basis of genomic risk (and therefore received chemotherapy) had a 5-year rate of survival without distant metastasis of 95.8% (95% CI, 92.9 to 97.6), as compared with a rate of 95.0% (95% CI, 91.8 to 97.0%) among those who underwent randomization on the basis of clinical risk (and therefore received no chemotherapy) (adjusted hazard ratio for distant metastasis or death with chemotherapy vs. no chemotherapy, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59 to 2.28; P = 0.66) (Fig. 2B).

I am not going to feel comfortable whichever way I go. If I DON'T do chemo, I will always worry if I will regret that decision if it comes back as metastasis, but if I DO the chemo, what long lasting toxic effects will it have caused for my body, when it may not have even been warranted in my situation. (Plus, as we all know, and my onco pointed out, even WITH chemo, metastasis can still occur). Like I said, I wish I knew the right answer. :-( On a side note, has anyone heard anything about the RGCC blood test out of Greece?   ",

      "Content": "Sep 7, 2017 02:31AM - edited Sep 7, 2017 06:34AM by LuvToCraft OK, so its been a very eventful couple of days. On Tuesday, I called Agendia to again speak to the doctor to clarify a few of my questions/concerns. She went above and beyond to address my concerns regarding the MammaPrint. By the way, BarredOwl, to answer your question, the 29% high risk recurrence on the summary page of the MammaPrint is referring to distant recurrence, not local, and not a combination of the two, just distant. Secondly, she was kind enough to send me an email, outlining everything we had discussed, so I could show it to my onco, with whom I had a scheduled apmt today, Wed. This email contained the benefit percentages to me if I chose chemo, (less than .9%, based on being low clinical/high genomic risk, it had graphs, etc. I printed out the articles form NEJM, ASCO, and any other information that I wanted to discuss with the dr. In addition I placed a call to my breast surgeon, as well, yesterday, Tuesday, just to ask some specific questions about my tumor pathology, grading, etc, and was advised that they usually do not grade lobular cancer, but that the type I had, classic lobular, is usually grade 1 or 2. I needed this info to be sure I was indeed low clinical risk for my treatment decision. I brought her up to date on everything that's transpired since my last visit, because she was unaware of the additional MammaPrint situation. She just knew about the Oncotype results of my 21 RS. When we touched on my dilema of treatment options, she basically said she has to defer to the oncologist, which I understand. Then this morning, Wednesday, she called me at 9:30AM to tell me that she just had a meeting at the hospital with the tumor board, so she brought up my case. Two oncologists, one the head of oncology and research at the hospital, and also in private practice, both said that they would just recommend endocrine therapy. She gave me their names in case I was interested in seeing a different MO. But I was encouraged to know that these two docs would only recommend hormone therapy, and no chemo. How nice was that of my breast surgeon for doing this for me!! Now on to my 1PM apmt with my MO. Armed with piles of printed material ready to go over all the data, which I was hoping he would be open to discuss with me. When we sat down, he explained that he had done further delving into my case, and told me that in my situation, I wouldn't gain much from doing chemo, perhaps only .9% benefit. THEN, he goes on to tell me that just yesterday he received brand new data from Oncotype, which hasn't yet been published, but they have established new guidelines. They now will be considering recurrence scores of 1 thru 25 as low risk, no chemo needed, (rather than 1 thru 18, as is currently the case). He showed me studies, graphs, etc from Oncotype, which showed zero benefit in doing chemo for those under 25. He just received this yesterday, but could not give me a copy of the printed material, because it has not been published. He promised me a copy, as soon as it is published. So although, based on their previous guidelines, and my intermediate score of 21, he still didn't recommend chemo, until Pandora's box was opened with the MammaPrint results, changing his original thoughts to chemo, he now feels totally confident to not recommend chemo. So needless to say, I didn't even need to go over everything I brought along, because he had completely revised his recommendation. Based on my age, my clinical risk, and the new guidelines with Oncotype, the MO is confident that hormone therapy is the way to go. Just wanted to let everyone know of these new guidelines from Oncotype Dx.",

Thank you for mentioning that. I just noticed on my MammaPrint summary page, that it did have 2 dots on the graph for MY individual score of (minus) -.090. These correlated to a 5 yr risk of recurrence of approx 18%, and a ten year of approx 23%. So I guess what I can gather from this info is that the AVERAGE recurrence risk of 29% that is given for high risk, is for everyone within that (minus) -1.0 to 0.0 bracket. So since mine is -.090, the risk is somewhat lower, (not by much, but slightly), than someone e.g, in your above picture, with a .350 score, or even someone with a closer to 0.0 score. Thus the average 29% which they give. So my untreated risk in 5 years without ANY treatment would be approx 18%, and perhaps with hormone therapy can be half of that? I would opt out of chemo with those figures. And a side note is that I had read somewhere that the benefits of chemo only kick in for the first 5 years, (as per the blue bottom graph showing 94.6%, and then from 5 to 10 yrs, your risks are the same whether you had chemo or not?     ** Have you heard anything about the Prosigna/PAM50 (NanoString Technologies Inc.) I am going to ask my MO if he can request that test. It would definitely help me in my decision. I now have the oncotype showing no chemo needed, the MammaPrint showing a benefit with chemo, so this would be a definite deciding factor. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4603628/ Identifying patients at high risk of breast cancer recurrence: strategies to improve patient outcomes << Although there was a suggestion of benefit for chemotherapy added to endocrine therapy in high-risk patients, the level of evidence does not meet the threshold for determining clinical utility.>> (mammaprint) Key differences between genomic assays A high rate of discordance has been observed between the MammaPrint and Oncotype DX assays. The results of a small, single-institution study conducted in France on patients who had both the MammaPrint assay and Oncotype assay showed that of patients in the MammaPrint high-risk group, ten of the 22 (45%) had a low RS, (Oncotype Recurrence Score) indicating minimal benefit from chemotherapy and only one of the 22 (5%) had a high RS. This discordance in risk assessment was reproduced in another study by Shivers et al, which directly compared MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, and Mammostrat. In this study, 33.3% of MammaPrint high-risk patients were classified as low risk by Oncotype DX and conversely 5.6% of low-risk MammaPrint patients were classified as high-risk RS. A direct comparison of PAM50 and Oncotype DX showed concordance for high RS and luminal B (high risk), as well as luminal A and low RS. However, more patients in the intermediate RS group were reclassified by PAM50 as low risk, suggesting that PAM50 may augment prognostic information provided by Onctoype DX alone.53 Although each of these assays can reliably predict risk of recurrence, only the Oncotype DX has been validated at this point to predict the benefit of chemotherapy. Clinicians should use caution and consider the limitations of these tests when considering which assay to use in decision-making about treatment. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16720680/ A total of 651 patients were assessable (227 randomly assigned to tamoxifen and 424 randomly assigned to tamoxifen plus chemotherapy). The test for interaction between chemotherapy treatment and RS was statistically significant (P = .038) Patients with low-RS (< 18) tumors derived minimal, if any, benefit from chemotherapy treatment (relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.46 to 3.78; absolute decrease in distant recurrence rate at 10 years: mean, -1.1%; SE, 2.2%). Patients with intermediate-RS tumors did not appear to have a large benefit, but the uncertainty in the estimate can not exclude a clinically important benefit. The RS assay not only quantifies the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in women with node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, but also predicts the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit. Clinical prediction https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3089800/ Kaplan-Meier analysis for time to metastasis as a first event revealed nonoverlapping confidence intervals between low- and high-risk patients, suggesting that the 70-gene microarray test discriminates among tumors with differing metastatic propensity in this cohort (older women), despite use of adjuvant treatment (Fig. 2). Despite this trend, and most probably due to the low metastasis event rate in this cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in time to distant metastasis between patients classified with low-risk or high-risk tumor signatures in the MGH cohort. In contrast, microarray classification of tumors from node-negative NKI patients previously revealed statistically significant differences between high- and low-risk signature patients for time to distant metastasis (P < 0.001; ref. 11). This finding that the 70-gene signature molecularly classifies a significant percentage of older age breast cancer patients as \"high risk,\" of which few develop metastatic disease, may offer insight into the process of metastases. Following Paget's hypothesis that metastasis depends both on the \"seed\" (the cancer cell itself) and the \"soil\" (the \"host\"), our findings raise the intriguing hypothesis that most breast cancers in older patients are intrinsically high risk but that this intrinsic metastatic capacity does not become manifest due to other (possibly host) factors in these predominantly postmenopausal patients. Because older women with newly diagnosed breast cancer are increasingly being offered adjuvant treatment, in contrast with historical practice patterns, larger studies of the 70-gene signature should be done to determine whether the MammaPrint assay (with its excellent NPV) is clinically useful for pretreatment determination of intrinsic risk in older breast cancer patients. An open question in light of the poor PPV of MammaPrint in older patients is whether there exist additional, clinically useful gene expression signatures for positively predicting distant metastasis risk in the postmenopausal breast cancer population. Clearly, larger studies on postmenopausal breast cancer cohorts will be required to address this issue.",

From all my research, it appears that those in the discordant group, (low clinical, high genomic), would not benefit much from chemo. (My MammaPrint score, like yours, was also close to zero at -0.090.) From my understanding, the MammaPrint is meant to help those who may have been high clinical, but due to a low genomic risk, they could avoid chemo. Those who are low clinical/low genomic would obviously not be recommended chemo, and those with high clinical/high genomic would definitely benefit from chemo. So those of us in the discordant group (low clinical/high genomic) do not seem to benefit from having the MammaPrint done. And according to all the Journal articles, and ASCO articles, there were studies done showing not much benefit by doing chemo in this situation. My onco was ready to recommend chemo at first, but then did further research and decided that I would only benefit by perhaps 2% by doing chemo, so along with my Oncotype results, he is comfortable with no chemo. That's not to say that someone else, given a 2% benefit, would jump to do the chemo, because they want to feel they are doing everything possible. But for me, I have decided tthe benefits do not outweigh the risks. And I am hoping the Anastrozole will do what its supposed to do.",
