Before being diagnosed with BC I had lost 40 lbs over a 9 month period with diet and exercise. I actually had become a runner. On Jan 31 I had Left BX with Tram reconstruction. I saw my PS today and suggested I start Yoga for back pain.  I am walking hunched over due to the stomach stitches and afraid to stretch to much, afraid that I will ripp something. MY PS also mentioned that it was okay to walk. SO I am starting tomorrow morning I think  iwill also start 45 minutes a day for a week and increase each week. I will keep you informed. I love the recipes. I have also decided to give up beef. Have not been getting in my 8 glasses of water which I know is important. As BC survivors we should be drinking only purfied waer, correct? OR does it matter?  On my journey of eating healthier, I thought that I should be drinking soymilk and just found out that it is harmful to me becaue I am ER+,,,,,,down the drain it goes. So I have been researching for milk I should drink rBST free milk, right? We should avoid soy base, right? THanks Any tipps on stretching with Tram surgery in the abdomin area? Talk to you tomorrow:)",
