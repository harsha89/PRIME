It's somewhere in this thread...hope y'all don't mind me sharing it again here. So here it is: http://lunatechchick.blogspot.com/2011/12/all-this-hairy-businessorhow-long-will.html I'm also pretty close to the last updated pic for it, called \"Mission Accomplished\". Like soooooo many others, the hair loss thing was the hardest part for me....not the cancer, but the hair. But it DOES come back & faster than you think too. Hope y'all are all doin good. Hang in there! And if I can help at all, just lemme know! xx",

      "Content": "Feb 13, 2013 12:49PM - edited Feb 13, 2013 12:51PM by LunaTechChick Hello, I have not posted in this forum before. I am a 3 1/2 year survivor.  I have had several people ask me to share this link to my blog over here.  I thought I had, but apparently it was shared on another forum.  I hope this is the appropriate place & that it is permitted to share links to blogs with photos. Or should I have started a new topic?  I apologize, I didn't see a \"Introduce Yourself\" type of thread anywhere, but I'm sorta new to this site. Anyway, I had to have 2 lumpectomy surgeries (second to get the clear margin), then TCH chemo / Herceptin then radiation.  When I first was told I was gonna have chemo, the hair loss part really was the most traumatic part of the whole ordeal for me. So I searched & searched the internet for blogs & pics from others who were going through it or had already gone through it.  And the ones I found really did help.  So I did one on my blog, & thought I'd share it with y'all here.  Hope it might help others who are havin a hard time with the hair loss part of treatment.  So here's the link: http://lunatechchick.blogspot.com/2011/12/all-this-hairy-businessorhow-long-will.html   Feel free to share the blog/post with anyone you think might find it helpful, or bring a smile when they see my mohawk! =) So, after numerous messages from people telling me this post should be shared here, it is now.  If this is not the right place, or if I should have started a New Topic, just let me know & I'll correct or whatever is the right thing to do. :)    I used Aveda hair products before the bc, on my bald head, & still use it.  :)",

Some come back curly, some a different color. Some of y'all know I totally blogged my regrowth. And since today is the FOUR year anniversary of my last chemo, I updated the \"Hair regrowth post\" one last time with the \"Mission Accomplished\" photos. So here's the blog post that pretty much documents Hair To Bald To Hair Again. Hope y'all are all enjoying the holiday season & the regrowth! =)",
