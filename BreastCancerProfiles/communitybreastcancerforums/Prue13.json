The pain started after session 4 of radiation therapy, I am up to my 12th session.  I am yet to see the Rad Onc and discuss this with her. I'll let you know what her thoughts are on it. I finished chemo on the 15th May and was told by my Med Onc that aches and pains from the Docetaxel chemo can last up to a few months after finishing...so I am wondering if it could also be that. I know there has been such experiences from woman on here. Did you have chemo? Cheers, Prue ",
