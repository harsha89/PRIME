The doctor is going back and having the radiologist reread the MRI with her there. The FNA produced fluid in two and cells in another. In a little bit of pain, but now waiting to see where this is going. Thanks.",

How many days could you not lift anything heavy? What is it like? I am a little nervous -- okay actually a lot nervous. I am a 34 yeard old mother of an active 18 month old. My husband is going with me me tomorrow.  I had three suspicious areas found on an MRI. The scheduling nurse told me to prepare for the mammotome procedure. Log in to post a reply",

Recently, I have been experiencing a very sharp, pulling pain that comes and goes. When it heightens it is horrible. I was given muscle relaxers by my Family Doctor (which I hate, and I am not sure if it stops it or knocks me out so I don't notice it). I am seeing the NP at my surgeon's office tomorrow. Have any of you experienced this? I can tell there is some swelling. I am trying not to worry, but well, anything in there makes me worry. Have you experienced it? What caused it?
