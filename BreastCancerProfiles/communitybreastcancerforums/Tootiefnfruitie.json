In my findings i read that it can thin the wals of your vagina and cuase some discharge with shredding of tissue. im really crying out and hoping someone else has experianced this as i suffer from depression and this is the last thing i need on top of cancer. can someone please respond to me thank you in advance for any responses Log in to post a reply",
