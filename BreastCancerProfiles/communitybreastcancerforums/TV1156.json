This has been a rough year and have co e through it relatively ok. I'm hoping to hear how your recovery was, did you have any complications Nd are you happy with your results and if you had to do it over agin would you choose implants. I'm scheduled for surgery in the next 2 weeks so any advice would be appreciated.

I was absolutely fine on Friday and Saturday.  I did experience some discomfort in lower back/tailbone area from the Neulasta shot.  I had read somewhere that soaking in a epsom salt bath helped to alleviate some of the discomfort.  I did try that and it helped somewhat.  Also, I went to acupuncture on Saturday and discussed my symptoms in details with the acupuncturist. I honestly think by doing acupuncture after chemo it's helping to ease my anxiety and symptoms throughout my treatments. If you can look into acupuncture.  My insurance covers it so I'm going for one-on-one treatment since my insurance covers it.  However, you should look into wherever you're being treated to see if they offer this as part of integrative therapy.  I'm being treated at Sloan Kettering and they do offer this at a reduced cost.  I've only got 2 down under my belt but I'm going to stick to what I've been doing so far with the fasting.  Yesterday was a bit of a struggle with sweating all day long but stayed inside with the AC cranking (I'm dreading my electric bill by the end of all this).  My hair started coming out on Friday so I had a friend who's a hairstylist do a GI Jane style haircut.  I'm anticipating being bald probably by the end of the week.  I was prepared with wigs and halo wigs.  Oh the joys of chemo!   ",

I had acupuncture the 5 day and felt like a entirely different person the next day.  Needless to say I 'm going to be having acupunture the entire treatment and will continue to fast prior (no more that 600 calories day before).  I'm going to try and incorporate Bikram yoga while getting chemo.  A couple of people swear by it b/c of the detox/cleansing aspects.  I'll keep you posted over the weekend on how I'm feeling.  Take care!
