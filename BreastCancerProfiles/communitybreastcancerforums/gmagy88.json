I went to go get a Ultrasound on my right breast and the report just states there are no areas of concern. The same for the MRI and Mammogram (without contrast which is also a worry since supposably it is not as effective) that they did on my breast. But i know something is up and is not said on the reports because during the Mammogram they printed an Xray that should a visible mass that was circled. But somehow thankfully everything was fine. But the thing that worry's me is that they want me to go see a surgeon...i thought everything was ok. They still have not told me why i have the symptoms which is also a cause for my worry. I am only 20 years old but my grandmother died from cancer and my aunt was recently diagnosed. I know its a fat chance that i have cancer since i have seen the stats but this is really worrying me since they seem to look really worried when they look at my test. Any help?
