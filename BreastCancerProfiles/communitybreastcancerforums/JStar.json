Ive had 2 lobular atypical hyperplasia biopsies, and a sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer at 43 nodes positive. No apparent BRCA 1 or 2.  My MRI in June was clear.  My \"GAIL\" score puts me around a 47% lifetime risk, other risk models up to 82%. I'm seeing two reconstructive surgeons this week to look into prophy bilateral.  It's a scary step to take when there isn't a known cancer at this point pushing the process, but my husband is all for us looking into it seriously.  My sister now has a primary pancreatic cancer, not from the breast, and a possibility is that all her follow-up body CT scans could have had an affect on her pancreas.  I'm heartbroken for her, and she is also encouraging me to do whatever I can.  My doctor recommends 3 options - 1) yearly MRIs, 2) tamoxiphen chemo, or 3) prophy mast.  My husband called our ins co and they said they'd cover, although I'm wondering if they really knew what he was saying...  But it IS one of the recommendations of the doctor so.. I'm blessed, husband says he'll pay for it even if ins doesn't (don't know where we'd come up with it, but love him for saying it).  IF you call your ins co and they say they'll pay, don't call again to ask.  All the best to you, I sure feel for what you're considering...  JStar  ",

Maybe the advocate can help us - we can't handle a huge $ surprise, and need to know ahead of time what we can expect. Has anyone else with Principal Insurance had surgery at NOLA, and how pleased were you with their level of payment? Thank you!",

When my ins co got the bill for the MRI, what they asked for was my dr's clinical notes indicating my lifetime risk (47% GAIL score, but some other models put me as high as 82%, and this is without the known genes). I'm currently consulting surgeons for prophylactic bilateral mastectomies, a total personal choice and not for everyone. My sister, who now has primary pancreatic cancer (apparently unrelated to breast as she is negative for brca1 and 2 - unless there is a brca3 or 4 that we don't know about yet), is all for me avoiding everything she's been through. I love her so so much.  I wish you luck and have just said a prayer for you as well. If nothing else, consider getting a doctor appt with someone at a larger center that is more aggressive in their approaches, and they will be more apt to fight for your right to an MRI.  Take care!  JStar",
