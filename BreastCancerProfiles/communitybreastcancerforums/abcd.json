I am nearly 65 and wonder if there is any chance I  will get my hair back! Those of you who had Taxotere and FEC, particularly of my age group, please share your hair regrowth experience.  How long after chemo discontinuation did you notice any hair coming back?  How long does it take to grow reasonable amount of hair?   can  I do anything to help the coming back? I am due lumpectomy with axillary node clearance on 19th of May.  Your experience would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  Dx 12/2010, IDC, Grade 3, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

My feeling is,  if I now go for treatment, the quantity of life span may increase but I will lose that quality.  My husband and children ofcourse telling me that, it will be still painful at the end but what about pain relief and simply go off to sleep? Any one feels the way I feel?   I am probably thinking selfish when I am so much loved by my husband and my two children.... but would they NOT get tired of me if I drag too long?  To me that would be heartbreaking and indignified from my point of view but would welcome your views.  My husband is 69 and just 8months ago had angioplasty and stent put in and we both were determined to make it a success with follow up medicines and regular walking etc, and now I won't be walking with him with all these treatment and he would stop doing so as well.  So, I am a bit selfish in that regard and the idea of leaving him alone in old age is also selfish but life goes on,he will be okay one day and atleast I can go from this world with dignity!  SORRY,  I also developed cataract and the plan of sorting that out has to wait but forgive me, I CAN HARDLY READ what I am writing,so plenty mistakes....  ANYONE in favor of my thought process?

What do you think is the survival rate? My daughter asked the oncologist but since I am not having biopsy from the surgery, they could not do the staging.  Are you all recently diagnosed or .....?  Do you have the same strength and stamina as you had prior to  this illness/treatment?",

So many questions......don't know what to ask and what not to!  I also do not understand what you all mean by HER,  I believe ER and PR means estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor but what is HER?   I am ER positive.  If anyone of you are the same, what chemo were you advised?  Did you have it intravenous or oral?   Did you need to stay as inpatient in the hospital overnight?  Did the chemo really shrink the tumour?  How frequent do you get chemo and at what interval and what is the total duration time?  Are you free in between to travel? Sorry to ask sooooooooooo many Q but please answer, you people know a lot and I am getting a lot of answers from you all,   A BIG THANK YOU.",
