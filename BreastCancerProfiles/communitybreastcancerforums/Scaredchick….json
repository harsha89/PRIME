I too was just diagnosed with bc and have just seen my first surgeon, she told me that my her2 is borderline and if final test (fish) is possitive that would be part of my treatment. For me I will absolutely be getting second opinion. But that's just me and no matter what first opinion was I'd want the second set of eyes and head of knowledge. No one here will judge you in any way for any decision. And as I'm a newbe the other ladies will be along with great advice. Best of luck and lots of hugs",
