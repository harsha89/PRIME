Bit told me i wouldnt heal right. They said if my new Mri shows growth then we will do surgery. Im so confused. They made no sense today.. Its like they have no idea what to do. So im left stressing till my Mri... Anyone know of anyone else going thru anything like this??",

Now they are saying behind the big mass that there is something that looks like some type of fluid sack. I was upset of course. Because now i have to get another ultrasound and mammogram( which the mammogram missed it in the first place). Then she said most likely another bisopy. Im tired. This is 16 months of drawn out tests miscommunication and really being hush hush to me. I know its because i dont have money or real insurance. Thats how i feel. Im not sure what else to feel. I have 3 kids and a husband. I dont want this to end up as oh i wish we figured it out sooner.. What should i do??!! Please help.im confused and sad and upset. Im in so much pain. Im tired. Im at the end. Just about to forget it all and just go on about my business.... If this was u.. What would u do?",

Not sure why because they sent me to get an mri so they can compare it too. I have share of cost of 2600. I have to meet that to get Medicaid.. Im calm as can be. Im just confused. Im not sure why they seem to be taking their time doing this. Everyone else i talk to tells me they cant believe ive been dealing with this for so long. My one bisopy came back neg. So im not to stressed about it being cancer right now. But they told me if left in there to long it could turn into something serious. So with that being said 16 months almost 17months of inverted nipple and pain and the masses are getting bigger. Just not understanding why they are taking their time... I just wish they would hurry up.. And i wish they would act like they care. But my luck. Lol. So hopefully they call me sooner and hopefully we can figure this out.. Im in Florida i am seeing a doctor at a breast surgery place. I am saving money to get a second opinion at North Florida..",

The nurse called me and told me they believe its still not cancer.. And that the new sack filled fluid thing that has showed up might be from my bisiopy. But if thats the case why didnt it show up on my last mri? She didnt have an answer and told me she would talk with the doctors as of now i am to follow up every 3 months. And dont have an appointment till april to see the doctor ive only met once for 5 mins..with all this i still have no answers. Im still in horrible pain. And im just left looking like im crazy. Im not surecwhat elseto do... So i googled about inverted nipple to get some questions so i can ask the doctors. And its nothing like i want to read. They dont even let me get a question in. So i will be saving to getva second opion. But im at a point is itveve worth it...haha. Going crazy over here! Does anyone at all know anyone that got an inverted nipple out of the blue? 17months and no answers",
