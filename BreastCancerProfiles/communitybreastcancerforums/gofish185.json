Just had the Oncotype DX test to predict distant recurrance even though I am technically node positive. My results came back a zero, both on the node neg. graph, and on the postmenopausal node postive graph. Doctors and I are unsure how to proceed given the test would indicate no chemo. Anyone had a similar result?? Any advice or info. would be great! Log in to post a reply",

Just received my oncotype dx results and scored a ZERO for distant recurrance. Now none of the Drs. or I know what to do. The test indicates no chemo but tumor grade and age say chemo. What a decision. Has your cousin been offered this test, it may help with her decision on chemo and what drugs. If anyone has had a similar situation please let me know. Good luck to you both!",
