My Surgeon said I would have surgery, radiation and a pill. No mention of chemo. But today when I met my Onco Dr., he pulled out a pamphlet and asked if I wanted to take the Onco test because it was covered by Medicare. Like I said in another post.....it almost felt like a sales pitch? Is this a necessary test. Chemo has never been mentioned beforüò≥ Have you all had this? Thanks ladies",

Right now I feel like I know more about cancer in these 3 months than I ever thought possible, or want to . Go to Dr. tomorrow to see what pill I am going to be on. You are all so supportive in a club I never thought I would be part of. I am so grateful. Wondering how long it takes to get results for that Onco test. My Dr. said they store my tumor for 10 years!üò≥  Have a great evening!",

I wasn\u2019t thinking that I should use ibuprofen. Now I know. Love you guys. Going online to order another binder bra like we got going home from hospital.
