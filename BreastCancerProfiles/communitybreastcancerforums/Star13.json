I decided to see a surgeon and at that time he advised me that we should repeat mammo in 6 months. In Oct. I had that mammogram and got a letter in mail saying that there was a abnormality seen on my mammo and to contact my doctor to schedule more testing, it gave no BIRAD score. I decided that it was probably the califications again and I would eventually call the surgeon. Well, yesterday I got two calls from the surgeon ( first call I missed) he called later in the evening and told me that I need to have a biopsy because the calcifications have changed and are \"bigger\". I asked him if we could just repeat the mammo in 6 months but he said \" I think we have waited long enough\" just really confused as to why the radiologist I saw that day made no mention that they were bigger, he didn't seem concerned. I am thinking of waiting until after January to do the biopsy, I would hate to have my holidays ruined. I wasn't worried before while on the watch and wait 6 months.. But now I'm kind of worried and terrified of the biopsy procedure. Does anyone know which type of biopsy they do? Please don't tell me the stereotactic biopsy :( Log in to post a reply",

No calcifications present 1/9  Addendum Report Multiple additional levels through block A1 and A2 are performed to the exhaustion or the parrafin blocks. An extremely rare minute focus is present in one or two deeper sections of block A1 showing calcium oxalate- like crystals with a foreign body giant cell reaction, which may or may not have accounted for the appearance radiographically. Clinical pathologic correlation is suggested. When I went in the see the BS this week he never went over the report with me just said I have fibrocystic changes( nothing in pathology report states fibrocystic changes)and to repeat mammo in six months. I really don't trust this surgeon have been unhappy with him for multiple reasons and do not plan on returning to him. I get the impression they didn't find calcifications? There were a cluster of more than 5, how is it that pathology couldn't find them? Really confused.. Also what does it mean that the pathologist wrote clinical pathologic correlation suggested?? Not sure what that means Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
