      "Content": "hyphencollins wrote: Hi everyone,  I'm not at all sure in which forum to post this question; my question is biopsy-related although not about waiting for testing results!  In my \"good\" breast, I just noticed a huge dimple as I lift my arm.  I was recently (3 weeks ago? I can hardly remember at this point) biopsied there and was diagnosed with PASH, a benign condition.  The PASH was non-palpable and only discovered through MRI.  I'm pretty sure this dimple is really new - like not-here-a-couple-of-days ago-new.  Anyone get dimpling after biopsy (in this case, an MRI-assisted biopsy)? If so, did it resolve?  I'm leaning toward a  prophylactic mastectomy on that side anyway but I'm not 100% there yet (will meet with Plastic Surgeon this week).  Thanks in advance!

I work FT and don't know what to expect about out of work time... and am somewhat stressed about it.  I didn't get a clear answer from the surgeon (\"quicker than you might think\") and I can't seem to find the info on the surgery articles.  I realize recovery times vary but what might someone typically expect?  Thanks!
