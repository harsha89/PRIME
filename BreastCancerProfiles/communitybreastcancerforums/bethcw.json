My PT did a lot of myofascial release techniques with me, and they really worked wonders!  I almost have normal range of motion and the skin now moves like it is supposed to.  I would definitely give it a try.",

That is the way my area was described as well with the whole area measuring over 6cm.  I had all of my lymph nodes removed during my UMX.  My surgeon did a SNB during my surgery, and both of my sentinal nodes came back positive, so he removed the rest of them at that time.  Thankfully, the rest turned out to be negative.  I do have a bit of remorse since all of the rest were taken out, and then ended up being negative, but better safe than sorry I guess.... I have not really had a lot of issues related to the lymph nodes being gone, it is important to start stretching that side out as soon as you can.  Reaching overhead continues to be my biggest challenge.  My underarm can sometimes be tight due to some cording, but the best thing I have done for that is seeing a physical therapist.  She has been a trememdous help in stretching, massaging, and teaching me what to expect and to be on the lookout for as far as lymphedema.",
