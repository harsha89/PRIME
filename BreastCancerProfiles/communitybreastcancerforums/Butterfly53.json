I had 4 A/C treatments and have now had 10 out of 12 Taxol treatments which I finish in two weeks. Last week I visited a Radiation Oncologist for a second opinion concerning radiation. He told me with my diagnosis if I came back from surgery with clean pathology he felt that radiation would not be necessary. During our visit, I asked him if he had received from my oncologist the MRI report that showed I had cancer in my internal mammary node (4mm) and infracavicular node (8mm). He checked his records and said no. Without assuming I was correct he called the medical records department and had the MRI disc sent to him. After his review of the disc he called. He relayed to me that my breast cancer was more invasive then I was originally told. Not only did I have a 36x19x19mm tumor my BC was in my breast skin as well and said it was extensive. And said those other nodes mentioned above also has cancer. He changed my staging to IIIC T4N3M0. This is now changing my whole way of thinking going forward as far as my surgery. I was planning on a double mastectomy with reconstruction scheduled for this April 17. I am now being advised to have only a mastectomy in the breast with cancer and concentrate my efforts on beating the cancer with radiation. That would mean I would have to put off reconstruction to a later date. My plastic surgeon is recommending a DIEP flap because of the radiation process. Has anyone been in this situation? Should I consider changing my breast surgeon because I was never made aware months ago at diagnosis that my diagnosis was incorrect. What about my oncologist do I hold him responsible for the incorrect diagnosis? At this point I can't even comprehend what this new diagnosis means to me personally. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks! And hugs to all my sisters fighting the fight Log in to post a reply",

First, I do keep 2 binders one for tests and the other for bills and, of course, a date book that I would be lost without. Fortunately, I've never been denied any of my records whether written or discs. I think my problem lies in the fact, that no one....not my BS, my Onc, or the radiologist who did all my tests never explained my tests to me. I don't think the radiologist should be responsible because my BS ordered the tests. If the BS stages you, and requests more tests shouldn't everything be re-evaluated afterward. On my original lymph node biopsy it was determined cancerous. They only tested one node. The MRI of the breast showed numerous enlarged, abnormal nodes, as well as, abnormal node in my infraclavicular and internal mammary nodes. The MRI also showed a thickening of my beast skin and was more extensive than just the tumor. This information came from both Radiation Oncologists and the time they spent showing me the discs. This put me into a Stage IIIC from a IIB. I first became aware of this around Christmas when I went to visit the first radiation oncologist. I was too busy thinking about the holidays and my family coming to visit to concern myself until the first of the year. As I mentioned, since then I went to another radiation oncologist, a professor, who did an excellent job of explaining my cancer to me. Finally! This past week I went back to the original radiation oncologist. They totally agree with each other. Ok! I'm making progress.  My dilemma....I definitely am going to have a bilateral mastectomy because 22 years ago my sister had BC and I don't want to have to think about this after I'm done. The issue now is timing....... before my stage changed I was going to have surgery/reconstruction and now I think I should just concentrate on radiation. As a stage IIB, radiation was not eminent but now it is. I believe your advice is to do radiation and wait the required amount of time to have reconstruction and initially only have a unilateral mastectomy. I was mentally starting to head in that direction but after hearing from all of you that seems like a good plan. My surgery is in April. It will be interesting to see the pathology after surgery. That seems to be the most conclusive results. Hope all is well with everyone. HUGS",

You brought up two important topics that I have just started to mull over since I had IIIC thrown at me. I was on a fast tract with bilateral surgery/reconstruction then radiation and finally the DIEP flap. But you said your PS recommended having only a unilateral first and then radiation. May I ask why he/she recommended one at the time instead of both? Also, is that how long it takes nine months after radiation to start reconstruction? Are you happy with your DIEP flap? Did you opt for implants or using fat from your own body? I'm sorry for your long journey you've been on. It sounds like you are in a good place now. I appreciate any help you can give me. Hugs!",

I am currently seeking other options. I don't understand how both doctors could have gotten it wrong. But, two highly educated radiation oncologists came up with the same conclusion. I have definitely decided to concentrate on fighting the cancer with radiation rather than concerning myself with reconstruction at this time. I never had any of my doctors go over my pathology reports with me or my breast MRI, CT Scan, Bone Scan or Brain MRI. I had a conference with my breast surgeon after mammo, ultrasound and biopsy. That's when she staged me, told me about all the additional testing I would need and sent me off to the oncologist. The oncologist apparently concurred with the breast surgeon because he never said anything different. The breast MRI showed much more. It's almost as if that report never was considered by either doctor. I have been so diligent staying on top of this from the very beginning. I keep all reports and discs. I am not a doctor and I've never had BC before or any type of cancer. Basically, all this mumbo jumbo you look at makes very little sense on the reports you're given. It's almost like they don't want us to know what's going on. Then you find a good honest doctor that sees your struggle and helps you navigate your way through this because he actually really cares. Now that's refreshing. Thanks again for all your help. Hugs to everyone",

I was surprised when I first started treatment and asked the oncology nurse for a copy of my blood test and she asked why I wanted it. I like to keep track of my tests to see how I am doing from week to week. I've kept copies of all my tests and I realize that's not even enough. If you don't ask very specific questions, you are not necessarily going to get the answers you need. The doctors should be forthcoming with my condition and not expect the exhausted cancer patient to keep coming back with questions. I am starting to wise up and sending off emails. I want to see their responses in writing. I may sound angry but I'm not. I'm really scared. I feel like I'm fighting the battle with my medical team being on the opposing side. I find this draining to my positive healing energy. I am exploring new avenues. Hope all is well with you. Hugs",
