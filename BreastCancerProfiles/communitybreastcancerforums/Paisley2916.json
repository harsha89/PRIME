Wed - Pet Scan, Thursday - Oncologist, Friday - Echocardiogram, Monday - Port Placement, Tuesday - First Chemo, Wed- Neulasta shot. So, now a full week later, I have all of my answers and have begun treatment. Pet scan was clear!!!! That was a HUGE relief. I've had my first dose-dense treatment of AC last Tuesday. It was ok. Tolerable. Wednesday was my worst day - where I couldn't even get my kids ready for school or make it next door for the bus stop. They were great though - they got themselves ready and my neighbor got them on the bus. I had NO appetite and things tasted bad and smelled even worse until about Saturday night. Now, I'm just feeling tired. They say \"fatigued\". I say, I feel like I just ran 10 miles and my muscles are rebelling! Now, I'm just waiting for my hair to fall out. I had a dream about it last night and I've been noticing a few eyelashes here and there have started to come out yesterday and today...haven't noticed any hair yet though. Honestly, I don't look forward to it.... Lemonee, how are you doing with your first chemo treatment? EastCoast, I did get anti-anxiety meds to help me through the first 6 weeks. The testing and waiting was agony. The meds def helped. I haven't needed them since I've started treatment. I've calmed down a lot. I know a lot of people here have told me the beginning testing and waiitng is the hardest part. So far, I agree with that! Agatha, thank you for your advice. I did take the time to get ready over the weekend in between all of those appointments and felt more prepared when I had my first treatment. I hope you are doing well. I'm also doing the AC+T. AC for 8 weeks - every two weeks and then 12 weeks of Taxol - weekly. I'm nervous about the Taxol. They've told me about the possible nerve damage - and I'm worried about not getting a week off in between the treatments. How did you do with it? Hope everyone is doing well. I'm so happy to have other women to talk to that are going through the same thing as me. While I have a lot of family and friends supporting me, I don't think anyone can fully understand what it's like going through this unless they have gone through it (or are going through it) themselves. Take care everyone!",

I finished my dose-dense AC on February 28th and will start 12 weekly Taxols next Wednesday. I'm super nervous about it and was hoping to get some info from those of you that have gone through it already or are going through it now. How does it differ from AC - as far as side effects? My biggest complaint with AC was feeling like my entire digestive system shut down - then also the usual side effects of nausea, tired, just plain not feeling well. Do you ice your hands and feet, and if so, what method do you use? Homemade ice packs - or something purchased? What can you tell me about the neuropathy? How common is it and how bad does it get? I so appreciate any insight you ladies can give me - I'm really nervous about switching to this new drug - and the premeds as well! I hate not knowing what to expect. Thanks so much for any advice!

I'm glad I know what to expect this time around - the first time I think I wasted a lot of energy analyzing everything that I was feeling or doing since I didn't know what to expect. I don't look forward to it, but I know I can do it. Last Friday, day 11, my hair started to fall out. Every time I'd run my hand through my hair, I'd get at least 10 strands that would come out. By Saturday, it was a little worse, and by Saturday evening I was close to getting \"clumps\". I didn't want to see any big clumps coming out, so my kids played \"hairdresser\" Saturday night and had a blast cutting my hair, giving me layers, and giving me bangs (that were WAY too short and crooked!!!). There were lots of laughs and I'm not going to lie, some tears. But, I have to say, after it was all done and my husband buzzed it off, I felt so relieved. I actually felt stronger and - sounds a little corny - but I felt empowered. I actually like my buzz cut! Super light and easy and feels good. I think I have to get used to the gray more than the actual cut!!! I usually colored my hair, but the roots have grown out and now, I'm about 90% gray!!! I've been losing a few eyelashes here and there. Does anyone have any recommendations on where to get eyelashes/glue or any recommendations on makeup brands for eyebrows? I haven't started to lose my eyebrows yet, but I'd like to be prepared for when/if I do. Take Care everyone! ",

I start tomorrow - and honestly I'm practically in tears of the thought of going back after having 3 weeks off. I feel so good right now - I don't want to do this again! But, the encouraging part is that most everyone has said that Taxol was easier than AC - so that helps a lot! I plan on using homemade ice baggies to ice my hands and feet tomorrow. My MO office doesn't put much stock in icing, so they don't provide anything. But, it's certainly worth a shot! It can't hurt! I am in the same boat as a lot of you as far as hair loss - or lack of loss. I have to say I'm extremely irrated that I STILL have to shave my legs! That was the one thing of losing my hair that I was looking forward to - but it never fell out. Just the hair on my head, underarms, and most of my nethers. I still have most of my arm hair and leg hair below the knees. I lost my hair on my head starting around day 11 after my first AC treatment. My eyebrows are at about 50% hair loss and my eyelashes have thinned, but not too bad. I expect to lose the eyebrows and eyelashes after I start taxol. Some of you women are just my heroes! I LOVE how active you all are staying and how you are taking advantage of your downtime in between chemo treatments. It's been 3 weeks since my last (dose-dense) AC treatment. I really was only able to enjoy this last week since it took a while to bounce back this time. But, I enjoyed easter shopping with my Mom and seeing a movie (First time shopping in months for fear of getting sick). Then Friday, my husband skipped work, my kids skipped school and we all went to the museum and to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner. What a great week! I figure, I'll get my fun in now before I get too tired from the Taxol!!! Felt so good to feel almost normal again! Well, tomorrow begins my countdown of 12 more treatments - then done! Well, not really done. Three weeks after I finish chemo, I'll be getting a double mastectomy and either immediate or delayed reconstruction depending on if I need radiation. But, one thing at a time and for now, I'll focus on finishing chemo! Hang in there girls! For some reason, Dory keeps popping in my head, \"Just keep swimming....just keep swimming..\" :-) ",

I still have some Percocet left, so if something bad does happen I have that on hand, but if it continues I may ask them if I should have a muscle relaxer or something to help better. Now I'm dealing with diarrhea and acid reflux this week too. Definitely getting harder as I go. I really hope next week is easier when he decreases my dose. Did they decrease yours? Hang in there.

Having a rough last taxol treatment unfortunately. Not horrible, but worse than the recent ones. Had the last taxol on Wednesday. Got a call from the nurse on Thursday morning that I needed to go to the hospital that day and get calcium and potassium. Was there from 12:30pm - 5pm for that - longer than chemo takes! Still on steroids today and I usually feel good, but last night had arm twitches and slight leg pains and today having issues with muscles cramping again. Eating dinner last night, my jaw cramped up. Playing cards today, my hands cramped up. Annoying! This hasn't happened for a few weeks since my dose was lowered, but is back again this week. Super tired too, but I guess that's to be expected at the end. Feeling super nervous about my PET scan on Monday. I'm bummed I missed the call from the hospital to go over the test - I've had it done before but I had some questions to ask them. Every week for the last 6 weeks on taxol, when I go off my steroids on Sunday, I end up running a fever until I go back for the next infusion on Wednesdays and get more steroids. So, I'm most likely going to have a fever on Monday for the PET and I don't know if I can take tylenol and I'm hoping the fever doesn't interfere with them doing the test. I have to be there at 7am so I guess I'll find out when I get there. I did as my MO about it when I saw him last Wednesday and he didn't seem to think it would be a problem. I'll be really disappointed if they don't do the test after waiting for 3 weeks for this! I'll find out the results on Tuesday afternoon. Just really want to get this over with. Thank you for the good vibes and wishes for a clear scan. Someone also reached out to me in a private message with a similar situation that ended up being clear, so I will focus on that and know that it is a possibility that it may just be nothing. I've been having trouble sleeping and have been dreaming about cancer lately. Now that chemo is done, this PET scan and surgery is becoming so real and coming up FAST. The surgery (and now PET scan) are the most stressful parts of this entire process for me. I'm really having a hard time thinking about how I'm going to look after - disfigured comes to mind. Mutilated is another word.... I think it's just going to take me a long time to adjust to all of these physical changes.... Sorry to be such a downer - I go through phases of ups and downs (usually more ups), but lately down. I think once the surgery is over with, I'll be able to start the process of moving on and that will be helpful. Roxy - I'll look forward to that deep sleep! I could use a good sleep! Glad to hear the pain was manageable. I don't worry about becoming addicted to painkillers. I had to take percocet for a full week every 4 hours for the back and rib pain and stopped taking them as soon as I didn't need them for the pain anymore. I do carry them with me everywhere though because I'm so paranoid of that pain again, but I have no urge to take them.... Glad to hear your pain is most likely muscle pain. I hope it subsides soon! This is super long, so I will say good night! Thanks for being here ladies! This sisterhood is amazing and I really couldn't get through this without all of you!",

I thought I had my hair cut short enough that when it fell out in the shower, it would just go down the drain, but alas, I ended up stepping in a huge pile of \"fur\" and got very upset by seeing this. I lost about half my hair in that one shower and it was a little traumatic. The next day, before I showered, my husband buzzed it on the shortest setting we could go so I wouldn't have to see that again. They changed one of my anti-nausea meds at chemo last week during the infusion and I seemed to have a lot more nausea last week. I had to take more zofran and compazine and as a result, my digestive tract feels like it's only working at 10%. I could NOT \"go\". Saturday night it was so bad, we ended up calling the doctor at 11:30pm for a remedy - my senokot wasn't working and I couldn't take the discomfort/pain anymore. I hate to bug them on the weekend or during off hours, but they were very nice and helpful. I'm trying to get myself regulated before my next treatment next week so that it doesn't get any worse. I do NOT want to go through that again. I really need to try to stay ahead of it next time. (Sorry if this is TMI). If anyone has any tips for avoiding the wicked constipation, I'm all ears! PeachyJeanne, I was hoping to get some info from you about Taxol. I have two more AC treatments and then will do 12 weekly Taxols. I'm worried about what to expect - it's almost like starting all over again since it is a different drug. I'm not sure what side effects to expect or how I will feel. Did you get the nerve damage from it? Did you have the digestive issues with it that AC brings? The doctor said the fatigue would get progressively worse - is this true? How does it differ from AC? WorriedMe77 - I've been thinking about you a lot. I'm so sorry you are going through all of these extra stressors, and I hope your lung biopsy goes smoothly and returns good results so you can move on and not think about it anymore. I'm glad they are moving along with chemo to stay within that good timeframe. I was concerned about that timeframe as well - of starting chemo within so many days after surgery - so much so, that I'm doing my chemo first and then I'll have my surgery (double mastectomy) afterwards. This is a very stressful time, but just remember (As I keep trying to remind myself) this is all temporary. It's a long road, but it will get better. Coach - I'm so happy to hear you had a fun \"hair party\"! I did something similar by letting my kids play \"hairdresser\" and cut my hair however they wanted the night we were going to buzz it off. I think it's great to try to turn something that we normally wouldn't want to into something fun. Good for you! Sounds like a great day! OkKate - I'm so glad to hear you are feeling better! I've been so paranoid about getting sick during chemo - I felt so bad to hear that you had come down with the flu. I'm happy you are feeling better and able to get back to work! ",

I had lingering nausea, sinus issues (I think from the Cytoxan), just an overall feeling \"bad\". I also got a bit depressed this time around. I find that the first few days after chemo, I get really emotional - does anyone else having AC go through this? Overall, I feel like I just didn't bounce back as quickly this time. I went for my bloodwork today and I have my last AC treatment on Wednesday (Woo Hoo!). Next week, I'll be meeting with my breast surgeon to start talking about surgery (double mastectomy) and will get an ultrasound to see if things are shrinking. I still feel the lump and I can't tell if it has gotten smaller or not - so I'm pretty nervous about the US next week. I will be devastated if nothing has shrunk. Surgery won't be until I complete my 12 weekly Taxol treatments though. If everything stays on schedule, I should finish my Taxol the last week of May and probably have surgery in the beginning of July. Will find out more on that next week. I have been nervous about the Taxol - since it is new and I don't know what to expect. Last night I couldn't sleep so I found an old (2012) \"Weekly Taxol Group\" discussion board from this site and it really helped to get an idea of what to expect. There may be a newer one that I don't know about, but if anyone is interested here is the link: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topics... I'm pretty much completely bald now. My eyebrows are about half as thick as they used to be and I still lose eyelashes here and there, but they are hanging in there. I have my Look Good, Feel Better class coming up on March 12th that I am really looking forward to. Has anyone gone yet? What did you think about it? My 8 year old daughter has been having a hard time with me having cancer. I'm not quite sure how to help her. I constantly reassure her that I'll be fine, and this is temporary and that everything will get back to normal after treatment is done. But she still keeps getting upset. She doesn't like seeing me without hair and looking different. She has a classmate whose Mom passed away from breast cancer and so she thinks that's going to happen to me. I hate that this upsets her. I feel guilty that my kids get upset about this - I know it's not my fault, but it still really bothers me. Any advice on how to ease her worries would be greatly appreciated. Well, that pretty much sums up my life at the moment. Even though I don't post much, I always follow all of your posts and I can't tell you how much it helps to hear from everyone on here. I hope everyone has a great week this week! ",

What do you use - store bought ice packs? Homemade ones? Any recommendations on what to purchase? How are the SE compared to AC? Any advice? Thanks for any input! Hang in there everyone! This is temporary!",

I know I still had the steroid working for me, but I felt so relieved that I didn't feel \"sick\" like I did on dose-dense AC. AC was horrible - I really needed a good 4-5 days to even start to feel better. But, Taxol is totally different. I realize I'm only just beginning and it will most likely get harder as I go, but so far so good! The benedryl made me feel loopy and I had to close my eyes and rest during the infusion - never fell asleep though. Got my steroid, anti-nausea med, and pepcid. Then Taxol - felt nothing while it was being put in. Left there starving - had lunch and took an hour nap when I got home. Woke up feeling good - had energy from the steroid. Didn't get to sleep until around 4am and got up at 6:30am to get the kids off to school. Still felt great until the afternoon when the steroid started to wear off and I was able to take a nap. Today, I'm a little more tired, but not bad. I'm also feeling cold and only the slightest ache here and there in my muscles. The dreaded constipation has set back in - ugh! But, overall, I am SO happy about how this is going after how bad AC was! I iced my hands and feet - which was harder to do than I expected. It's really cold!!!! At one point I was shivering and I had to take little breaks from the ice packs here and there. I'm going to keep trying to do it - it's worth a shot if it'll help! I'm happy to be on the final countdown for chemo! 11 more to go! Hugs to everyone! One day at a time, we are getting there!",

Two days after the first round, I suffered severe pain all over my body for 3 days straight. They said they had switched manufacturers and some patients were having pain from whatever they mix the drug with. To address these SE, last week, they had me take steroids at home for 3 days after chemo, claritin every day, and tramadol (painkiller) starting Thursday night and then every six hours through Sunday. It got rid of the pain, but I was a zombie. Side effects listed for Tramadol are \"tiredness and weakness, sleepiness, not able to sleep\". Really?!?!? So, I spent the majority of my weekend lying around with my eyes closed and not sleeping. I talked to the nurse about this yesterday and she said to try taking 1/2 pill every 3 hours instead of a whole pill every 6 hours. I don't see how that will work, but I'll try it. If I have the same results, I'm asking for a different painkiller for next week. The combination of steroids and no GI side effects like nausea (other than constipation), have me eating and eating and gaining weight. I'm SO hungry from the steroids, but so tired from the tramadol, that I feel like all I'm doing is eating and laying around. Thank you for your post encouraging us to get up and get moving even if we are tired. I am going to make an effort to do this and to try to watch what I am eating. It's hard to get outside in Pittsburgh right now though - it was SNOWING this morning!!!! I think late next week, spring is supposed to finally arrive and I look forward to trying to get in a daily walk. Take care everyone! ",

I took a claritin the day before, the day of, and the day after and had almost no pain from the shot - until the last one and then just a little achy. I've actually been taking claritin every day for Taxol pain and I think it's helping with that as well. Amelia - we are on the same chemo schedule! I won't be done until June too! Did you do surgery yet? I'll be having a double mastectomy 3 weeks after I finish chemo. I'm getting ready to go in for my 4th taxol today. Not looking forward to it. I see the doctor today for the first time in 3 weeks. I'm curious to see what he has to say. I plan on asking him if I can use Deep Woods Off on my skin now that the weather is going to start getting nice. My husband just pulled a huge tick off of my dog yesterday. I'm also curious about gardening - I've heard that you have to watch tetanus which can be in the soil. I plan on asking about this today since I would love to put in a vegetable garden this spring. I'm a little bummed at how tired I've been already after only 3 taxol treatments. I expected to feel like this halfway through - not this early. I'm a little worried about how I'm going to be feeling at the end of this! I won't finish until the beginning of June! This is a really dumb question, but is it ok to use anti-wrinkle cream while on chemo? I usually use No. 7 brand and miss it. I haven't used anything except moisturizer since I started, but would like to start using the anti-wrinkle cream again. Tomorrow, I have a 2 hour appointment with a radiation oncologist to find out if I'll need radiation after surgery this summer. I'm not sure how I feel about it. If I get it, I worry about delayed reconstruction, lymphedema, etc. and if I don't get it, I worry that I won't be doing enough to prevent a recurrence.... Are you ladies doing radiation? Have you had your surgery yet? How does the radiation impact your reconstruction? Have a great day everyone! ",

The last two weeks have been pretty rough. I ended up with severe back pain that wrapped around the front of my chest under my ribs on the right side. It was equivalent to kidney stone pain or labor pains. I saw my doctor and they sent me to the ER to get checked for a blood clot in my lung. Those tests came back clear and they ended up giving me percocet and ibuprofen. Only 14 pills though! I got a refill from my MO who gave me 30. I had to take one every 4-5 hours just to function and could still feel pain, but tolerable on the pain meds. This went on for an entire week. My MO sent me for a whole body bone scan just to be safe. I had that done this morning and will hopefully get the results tomorrow or Monday. My pain has gone away since Monday, thank goodness, but then I ended up with what felt like a pulled muscle in the back of my arm. Then this morning, I woke up and stretched and both calves instantly cramped up. My left leg cramped up so bad that I literally could not straighten my leg and the pain was awful. I think Taxol is doing a number on my muscles. My MO said that we can decrease my does by 25%. I told him that I wanted the full dose this week (which was yesterday) and then the last 4 treatments can be decreased. Now, after this morning, I may be regretting my decision to not decrease now! I'm a little worried about what this week will bring! I've been exhausted. Everything is such an effort physically. Just walking around my house sometimes, my legs feel weak, exhausted, and sometimes my muscles will hurt. I really can't wait to be done with all of this. I hope the decrease next week helps with these side effects. I've run a slight fever twice in the last week as well which brought chills and just feeling lousy. My bloodwork is still holding steady though, so that's a good thing. My MO said he would rather decrease my dose and have me finish all 12 treatments than stop early. So, that is the plan and I'm determined to finish. I hope everyone is having a better week than me! OkKate - I am SO sorry to hear about your sister. She'll definitely have a great support system in you. ",

I've just had #11 of taxol and am so excited next Wednesday will be my last one. I've been dealing with some super annoying side effects that make every day tasks (like moving) difficult. My lungs are soooo tight and uncomfortable, I can't take a deep breath and just walking around makes me short of breath. It gets worse every week and I tell the doctor and nurses. They never hear anything and I had a chest x-ray that was normal last week - so I guess it's just an annoying side effect of the taxol. They assure me it will get better when I am done. I'm on steroid at home for 3 days after chemo to help with side effects, and like clockwork, every Sunday when I'm not on them anymore, I run a fever through my next treatment on Wednesday when I get more steroids. This basically makes me feel like I have the flu for 3 full days of chills, fever, and aches and pains. Last week, my MO told me since I'm not neutropenic, I can go ahead and take tylenol to help with the discomfort. It only helped a little. I just keep telling myself - ONE MORE! Almost there! Congrats to all that have finished! That's so encouraging and great to hear! I can't wait to join the club! Thank you for all the support on my bad bone scan and upcoming PET scan. I asked my MO if I could get the PET earlier so I don't have to stress about it, but he wants me to finish chemo first - something about chemo or PET interfering with each other....So, I have to wait until June 11 to get the PET scan and I see him on June 12 to get the results. At least I don't have to wait long for the results. Cross your fingers for me please! I'm so worried about mets to my bones. Olesya - your hair is coming in great - looks good! I'm so looking forward to mine growing back! It's started to grow back on my head during taxol, but is super sparse and totally white/gray. So, it's hard to see! I can't wait for it to thicken up when I'm done with chemo! Next in store for me will be my double mastectomy at the end of June. Super dreading it. Any one have that without immediate reconstruction? Any advice? Take care ladies! I don't post much, but it doesn't mean I don't read your posts and think about you often! ",

Day 3 (the day after the Nuelasta shot) it was an effort just to move! By the 5th day in the evening, things started to taste better and I was able to eat more. Been getting a little more energy every day. I go back next Tuesday, Jan. 30th for my next treatment (I'm on a Dose-Dense schedule) and I really don't look forward to it. It's hard to go and do this when I initially felt perfectly healthy and fine. I'm not sure I've fully accepted my cancer diagnosis yet - I mean, I know I have it, but the trouble I'm having is that I felt perfectly healthy and I have to put myself through this treatment when I felt perfectly fine. It would be easier if I felt sick and was doing all of this to feel better - but it's the opposite. Hard to wrap my head around....I haven't lost any hair yet - waiting for that to happen. I'm assuming it'll be within the next week? Usually around 2 weeks, correct? I have 2 young girls (8 and 10 years old).

I think they would give you antibiotics and possibly - if needed a blood transfusion. My mom's friend has BC right now and ended up in the hospital for 4 days from a sinus infection. She ended up with two blood transfusions becuase her counts were so low that she couldn't fight anythign off. From my understanding, the blood transfusion gives the higher rbc, wbc, etc to be able to fight off infections if the antibiotics don't do the trick. Good luck today!

Of course I'm paranoid about getting the flu or anything else, so I'll have my fun within reason! Nausea is starting to set in and I'm super emotional.

He said it's ok to take a multi-vitamin - just watch the iron because it can add to the constipation. Going to start taking one tonight. I also asked him if there was anything I could do to try to keep my counts up (rbc, wbc, etc.) I'm worried when Taxol starts and my body never gets a break since it'll be weekly - I don't want to have any treatments delayed. He said the only thing I can do is to eat healty, exercise, and try not to get sick. No Nuelasta during Taxol to boost counts. If they get to low - they delay treatment.... As I type away here with - my steroid saturated fingers - I just feel the need to say how with this total nightmare going on in my life, I am surprised at how often I've thought of how lucky I am and how grateful I am. I'm so lucky to have such supportive family and friends. They call and text to check up on me. They bring me frozen dinners without me asking. They go to chemo with me. And most of all - my husband. I'm so grateful to have him in my life. He doesn't feel like he's doing much because he can't physically make me feel better, but he has no idea how much he helps me. He has taken up the slack with cleaning when I can't. He does all of the shopping because he doesn't want me to go to the germy stores and get sick. He's gone to all of my doctor appointments with me (except chemo because he has to work - but he went to the first one and will go to my first Taxol one with me). He's patient and understanding when I have an emotional meltdown. He keeps the kids occupied when I need a break. He's never complained once. Not one time. I'm truly one lucky woman!",

Long story short, everything came back ok, but I had to live on percocet for a full week just to function. MO sent me for a bone scan to be safe.

My MO didn't even tell me about my head - I saw that on the report that I asked the nurse to give me. He said he wants me to finish chemo (I\"ll finish June 6th) and then he wants me to go for a PET scan on June 11th. I had a pet scan right before I started chemo and it was clear. He said they are very small spots and he can't be sure until the pet scan. But, I still have dull pain on my right side and the fact that there are three spots so spread out including my skull - which I never ever would have thought of - has me so terrified. I just don't know how to process this. I have to wait an entire month for this pet scan. It's agony! This is a game changer - I'd be stage 4 if this comes back positive on the PET. I don't understand how it could have spread though - I can barely feel my tumor in my breast since I've been doing chemo - and it was really big to start with so I know the chemo is working there....I'm just at a loss. I feel so defeated right now. I just keep thinking about my two little girls and I don't want to leave them without a mom.",

I'll find out on July 23rd - hopefully- what the surgery date will be. This has been such a roller coaster ride - emotionally and physically. The side effects of chemo, super high dose steroids, and now the heart thing are really taking a toll on my body. I'm so tired of feeling like crap - I was supposed to start feeling better after chemo ended - and all I've gotten was worse. It's very frustrating. I feel like I haven't had any fun in 7 months - and I'm too tired or not feeling well enough to actually do anything fun. I feel like the only time I get out is to go to doctor appointments.

If it continues to come out (and I know it will) we will be cutting it and then buzzing it off this weekend. Char105 - I'm with you - long hair and having a hard time with this. But, we can get through this! I just keep telling myself that it'll grow back. I started getting gray hair when I was 16! I'm only 43, but my hair is pretty much solid gray (I color it brown). I'm not looking forward to the buzz cut since it'll just be all gray then! And, when it grows back in - I'll be solid gray until I can color it!!!! It's kinda funny on one hand, and kind of depressing on the other!!! Hope everyone has a great weekend! ",

I scheduled this 2 months ago and can't believe I've gone through two months of chemo (AC) already!!! I was dose-dense AC and now I'm on a 3 week break before I start my 12 weekly Taxol treatments. This extra week is HEAVEN! The last AC treatment took me a lot longer to recover from - longer than the others. Yesterday - my energy levels were really good and I just kept telling my husband throughout the day - \"I just feel so good! I can't believe how good I feel!' I wouldn't say I'm feeling back to normal, by any means, but wow - what a little bit of extra energy can do! I still have the rest of this week and beginning of next before I go back to start Taxol. Boy, is it going to be hard to go back! I've decided that this will be my \"fun week\". Going to Look Good, Feel better today, Movie and shopping on Wednesday with my Mom, and Friday - we're taking the kids out of school, my husband is taking off work, and we are going to have a \"Family Fun Day\". I met with my breast surgeon last Thursday. He did a quickie ultrasound to check to see if things are shrinking. The small mass in my right breast can no longer be seen!!!!! The large mass in my left breast has gotten smaller!!!!! He said they will do bilateral mammo's and US after Taxol to check again before I have my surgery. For the first time in 2 months, I'm feeling quite positive about all of this. It's nice to know that the chemo is working and it makes all of the bad worth it. Have any of you ladies had a bilateral mammo with reconstruction? I'm going to have to start looking into this - there are so many options. I'll be meeting with a plastic surgeon on March 26th. I'm nervous about the pain that will come with the surgery! Well, hope you all have a great week! As my husband's aunt keeps telling me: \"Just keep moving forward....\"",

It's so great to hear how some of us are making it to the finish line with this chemo and moving on to the next phase of treatment! Amelia - Taxol #4 has been the easiest so far! I'm not sure what the heck is going on with me - maybe my body is adjusting to it? I had NO pain this time around and actually had a lot more energy this past weekend - although I may have overdone it, because I ended up taking a 3 hour nap today! I really hope this continues for me....I like the no pain thing! I asked my doc all my questions and he said OFF would be fine to use. He also said gardening is fine too - he said to make sure I keep doing the things that I enjoy. So, I may just throw some rubber gloves on under my gardening gloves to be extra careful. I know the OFF is strong, but we have such a horrible tick problem where I live (and a super high Lyme disease count in the area) that I don't want to chance getting sick from a tick, so I'll use it. Lesser of the two evils? I met with my Radiation Oncologist last week for the first time. He said I am in a gray area - of course! Nothing is ever easy or straightforward! Basically, it comes down to surgery/pathology results to determine whether or not I need rads. But, he said because of my age (43), the aggressiveness of the cancer (grade 3), and the large size of my tumor, that my risk for recurrence is higher and rads may be a good idea. At this point, I'm almost afraid NOT to do rads. I just want to do everything I possibly can to beat this thing and to prevent it from coming back. So, I've decided to not do immediate reconstruction. I've decided to just have the DMX at the end of June and that way, I'm all set for radiation if needed. He said, immediate recon can interfere with rads and can ruin the recon as well. He said best results for recon tend to be if you wait until after all healed up from rads. So, as difficult as it is for me to think about going flat for up to 9 months, I think I'm more comfortable with it and feeling less pressured to make reconstruction decisions at this point. Question for you ladies - have any of you had a mastectomy without immediate reconstruction? Are you doing rads? Have you thought about or started the reconstruction process yet - and if so, which way did you choose? I'm at a loss. I don't like any of the options - they all scare me, but I definitely want breasts again at some point..... Ladies beginning rads - I hope you will stay on here and keep us posted on how you are doing! OkKate - how was the first time going for rads? Please keep us updated! Good luck to everyone this week! Just keep swimming!",

Even before I had the rib pain and bad bone scan, I worried - now it's just magnified! Can't wait to get this scan over next week to know once and for all. I'm trying to stay positive, but the unknown is just so hard to deal with. Roxy - thanks for the \"glow\" comment - it's the steroids!!!!! LOL! Roxy, why did you think it spread to your rib? Did you have pain? Did you have testing done? I had severe pain in my chest and middle back which then the bone scan showed two suspicious ribs. My nurse today said that she's seen things before show up on a bone scan that turned out to be nothing, so I'm trying not to worry, but it's hard. Krose - so happy to hear that your test results came back good! That's such a relief and so great!!!! Amelia - thanks for remembering my last day! I'm so happy to be done. I had no sleep last night - was dealing with a fever from the taxol that I get every week, and also woke up dreaming about my last treatment. I think I was just so filled with emotions and thoughts, I couldn't turn off my brain. When I left the cancer center and got in the car, I actually broke down and cried - anybody else get emotional after the last treatment? I don't know what came over me. I guess it's just been such a long road and I was remembering when we left there for the very first time and how long ago that seems now. Well, I will still stay active on this board, but I guess I should find a double mastectomy board to join now - I could use some information on that since that is my next step. Anyone have or will have a double mastectomy here? I'm terrified of surgery - I've had 2 c-sections, but this will be the first time I will be completely put under with anesthesia. Thank you for all your support and informaiton. This group has been so helpful with getting through this difficult time. It's so nice to know we are not alone and we are always here for each other.

I finished chemo in June, ended up with taxol induced pneumonitis and ended up in the hospital for 9 days over two different visits. This delayed my surgery for about two months while I was treating the pneumonitis with high dose steroids (NO FUN). Ended up in the hospital again for 3 days for rapid a-fib (they think due to chemo)Had surgery in August and then physical therapy to get the use of my arms back after surgery. It was a VERY rough summer. I'm just over halfway through rads now - 14 more to go. Getting so sick of driving there every day, but glad that it's going quickly. My skin is getting red and I have some brown discoloration in a couple of spots that I'm going to have the doctor check out today. Getting a little short of breath (more than usual) and going to bring that up today as well since I'm paranoid about getting any more damage to my lungs. And I NEVER EVER want to have to take steroids again! A little tired, but not too bad. So far, this has been WAY easier than chemo or surgery! Hopefully it'll stay that way. After radiation is done I'll be starting tamoxifen which I am nervous about. We got a puppy at the end of September - a german shepherd. His name is Bruno and he is doing a very good job of keeping me active! I've been losing weight since we got him because of all the walks and playtime! He's been a great addition to our family! ",

I finished radiation on 11/27/2018. 30 rounds - 25 regular and 5 boosts. I burned pretty badly - my skin resembled that of a zombie: dead, gray, and peeling off - but has healed up nicely since. I can't seem to get through any of my treatments without some sort of complication, and radiation was no different. I ended up with radiation pneumonitis and pneumonia in my left lung (radiated side). I was at the ER twice and had a course of antibiotics for the pneumonia and have been on steroids for the last 3 weeks for the pneumonitis, as well as two different inhalers. My pulmonologist really upset me when he told me my diagnosis. I was already taking the antibiotic for the pneumonia part and he told me he was going to put me on steroids for the pneumonitis. I asked him how long before I can expect to feel better. He said, \"It may not get better....\" WHAT?!!! He said, \"It's probably all going to scar over. You won't be the same as you were before radiation.\" At the time, I was wheezing so bad that I had trouble falling asleep at night from the noise, and I was freaking out thinking I'd have to deal with that the rest of my life. Anyway, I am getting better. Slowly, but surely, I can breathe better and coughing and wheezing are much less now. Thank goodness! He NEVER should have said that to me without seeing how I respond to the steroid treatment. Ugh! So, I'll be on steroids into February because he wants me to stay on them until I see him again on January 31. Then I guess he'll taper me off of them if my lungs are good to go. Last Friday, I started tamoxifen. Had a hot flash the very next day and my calves were wanting to cramp up. Had a headache and just felt lousy that day. On Sunday, I felt great. Then on Monday evening, I started to see blood in my urine and had abdominal pressure and discomfort. I called my oncologist's office and talked to the nurse. She insists it's not from the tamoxifen and so it's \"not an oncology issue\" and I should call my PCP. So, I got in to see the doctor and they checked my urine. They said there is no infection, but there is a large amount of blood, so the day after Christmas, I get to go get ultrasounds done of my bladder and kidneys. The fun never ends. I can't believe it's been a whole year for us. I can't believe what we have all been through. I'm looking forward to a great Christmas this year and even more looking forward to the new year.

I had my first infusion on Wednesday. Thursday - even with 3 hours of sleep - I felt great because I still had the steroid in my system. Friday, it all went downhill fast. I started getting aches and pains - which they did warn me about. But, as the day went on, it got worse and worse. It got to the point that I had constant pain all over and then, what I'm calling these pain attacks on top of the constant pain. I'd get a painful jab in the most random places. They'd last about 5 seconds and then move to somewhere else on my body. One second I'd get a pain on the back of my hand. The next, I'd get a pain in my thigh. Then, my head. Then the top of my foot. Then my knee. You get the idea. It just wouldn't end. The constant pain in my legs was horrible! This continued into Saturday and by 3pm, I couldn't take it anymore so I called the office. The nurse who was on-call called me back and suggested ibuprofen and allegra or claritin. She said she could call me in a prescription for tramadol, but couldn't get me a narcotic until Monday since I'd need a written prescription. I don't want to take heavy duty pain pills unless I absolutely have to - so I told her I'd try the ibuprofen and claritin. I asked her how long this would last and she said that she doesn't ever get complaints about pain like this - but interestingly, I was the second call she got that day due to taxol pain! Weird! I took the claritin and ibuprofen. They only ended up taking the slightest edge off and I just had to deal with it. Today has been a bit better. The \"pain attacks\" have mostly subsided - just random ones here and there and the constant pain is now dull and tolerable. I am so blind-sided by this. They just kept telling me about cummulative fatigue and neuropathy - nothing about pain. I'm so worried about this Wednesday and dealing with this again. The nurse was really nice and said that they would have to come up with a plan so I don't have to go through this every week. I just can't do that pain again! Feeling so discouraged right now!

I should get my surgery date that day too. I am so relieved to have one part of this journey over and can't wait to just keep moving forward! In this picture is my favorite nurse who has given me my treatments for most of my taxols - I just love her!!!! ",

I was in the ER with chest pain to get checked for blood clot at the very end of April - I wonder if it's just the taxol messing with us that bad?... they never did have a solid answer for me of what it was....still get dull aches sometimes on that side. Well, I got home from the hospital yesterday - 5 days total. I'm so glad to be home. Pneumonitis is the diagnosis - caused by taxol. I'll be on steroids for the next 4 weeks at home and have to follow up with my oncologist and pulmonologist in two weeks. My surgery will be delayed for 4-5 weeks to allow my lungs to heal and to avoid delayed wound healing due to all the steroids. Since I had a Total Response to Chemo - MY CANCER IS ALL GONE RIGHT NOW!!!! - my oncologist said it is safe to wait that long for surgery. I'm going to look forward to finally maybe having a chance to feel better over these next few weeks and maybe actually get to enjoy life a little before surgery!!! The oncologist at the hospital told me that he's been in practice since 1986 and I'm the first case of pneumonitis he's seen. Another oncologist at the hospital said it affects less than 1% of people. Lucky, lucky, me! Not sure if I\"ll still need rads since my chemo worked, but I know there's no chance they'll touch me right now for an immediate diep flap, so I'm going to plan on doing just the double mastectomy and staying flat for a little while before doing delayed reconstruction. It'll be hard, but it was the original plan, and I think still the safest route for me to take. Insideout - Congrats on finishing your chemo and completing surgery! What type of surgery did you have? That was very recent - how are you feeling? Stay Strong Sisters!",

The first time around was 5 days (4 on oxygen) and then was home for 2 1/2 days and then went back in with a 103.4 fever. The end result was that they dropped my steroid dose too quickly - from 120 down to 60 when I went home the first time. This caused the inflammation to flare right back up again and cause the fever. What a pain! Surgery is delayed for 4-5 weeks while my lungs heal and I get off these steroids - which they are decreasing as slowly as possible this time. I'll be on them for over a month! Homemadesalsa - Here's the story of the complete response to chemo. On April 30th I had severe chest and back pain and had to go to the ER to get checked for a blood clot. All was clear. So, my oncologist sent me for a bone scan which showed 3 suspicious areas for metastasis - 2 ribs and my skull. I had to wait 3 weeks to finish chemo to get my PET scan to check for metastasis. When I finally had my PET scan, absolutely no cancer showed up anywhere in my body - not even in my breasts. So, I am extremely relieved and lucky - not only did it not spread, it is completely gone. I was stage 3 with cancer in both breasts - never did I ever imagine it would be completely gone - I just assumed it would shrink. I feel SOOOOOO lucky. I still have to have a double mastectomy - which should have been this week - but the pneumonitis is delaying that. But, now I'm hopeful that I won't need radiation since the chemo worked so well. I'll find out for sure after surgery. I don't know why, but since my last hospital stay (I just got home on Sunday) - where I felt like a human pin cushion - I've been really down. Maybe it's the steroids? Maybe I've just had enough with this? My muscles are so weak, I'm so tired, I can't physically do anything, I can't breathe well enough yet to do much around the house, let alone go anywhere. I'm feeling like a lousy mom because my kids are home for the summer and I can't do anything with them. I feel like I haven't had any fun for months because I'm too sick or tired. I've done really well emotionally for the last 6 months (I've had my bad days, but always bounce back), but after this last hospital stay, I think I've reached my limit. Not sure what's going on with me....in a funk and having trouble getting out.",
