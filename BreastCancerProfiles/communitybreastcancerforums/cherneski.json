Of course she is no fun anymore!  She NEEDS HELP AND UNDERSTANDING!  Thank God for you.  Bless you. Hugs and prayers. Just keep being a good friend.",

I see so many women that opt for I bilateral.  Would my Dr. do this if I chose this event without BRCA +.  Does insurance pay for a bi if it is your choice? I am not eligible for immediate recon as I smoke.  Yes I plan on quitting however now all I do is chain smoke since my DX.  If they don't do immediate recon how will they get my skin that big again?  I am DD and if they take all the skin away wont it take forever for it to grow back again.  Is that why some of you have tissue expanders?  When will they put the expander in? What is an exchange?  I see some posts about being in the hospital for a day or so.  I am scheduled for outpatient same day is this normal? After just surgery not including chemo or rads how long are you kept out of work?  I am required to lift 40 lbs over my head at my job and work in a very dirty germy place?  If I get rads can I still reconstruct?  I have heard that not everyone loses their hair, but from what I have seen breast cancer patients lose their hair.  Is there any possibility I will not lose my hair.  How long does it take before your hair falls out?  And how long before it starts to grow again?  I am definitely getting chemo we just don't know what kind and for how long. How long will I be under the weather after the surgery?  How bad is the pain? How long will I be in pain. Thank you all so much this board is such a blessing.

My moods are insane.  My 1st TX wasn't THAT bad but each TX after has gotten twice as bad as the one before.  My taste buds are all screwed up.  Most things taste like crap to me.  When chocolate doesn't taste good you know you are screwed up.  A week and a half after TX #3 I started a new nightly ritual of puking at 2 am, but last night and tonight it has moved to 9pm.   Also what started with 2-3 days of being bad I now have almost 2 full weeks of feeling like total crap.  I too have 3 more TXs to go.  I am not looking forward to them.  I am scared to death of my next one as if they just keep getting worse how bad can the next one be.  October 6th will be my last chemo.  I cant wait!  But it seems sooooooo far away.  I keep trying to look at I am a little more than half way there.  Congratulations to everyone done.  I wish you all the best in your next part of your journey.  Thank you all for being so positive. Imt041409, I just spoke to my onc. today about sex.  My problem is not that I don't have the drive, cause I do, but that I just cant get there anymore.  There is a thread \"give me back my mojo\" on here (at least I think that is what it is called).  She told me it is so unfortunate that the issue is not addressed, in the medical field.  It has been addressed for men; why not women?  See what I mean about me being a buzz kill.  I asked her if I could try some of the pills you see on TV or in the stores that promise you the world.  She told me I can as long as they don't have estregen.  She asked me to kinda do some research and whatever I find that works to please let her know so that she can recommend it to other patients.  She is as upset about this as I am.  I think she is more upset than me that the issue just gets no respect.  She also suggested I start a support group in the cancer center with woman going through the same issues.  I was amazed at her confidence in me.  Does anyone know of a cream or pill that will help with making it to mojo land?  I miss being there.  hugs to everyone",

I If you dont do immediate recon, they save as much skin and tissue as possible, so it is kinda placed under my arm, towards the outside of my chest, they call them dog flaps.  They are a little uncomfortable and dont look very nice, but livable.                                                             I had over 70 staples across my chest, although my scars are not nearly as bad as they sound.  I thought I would be totally flat, like a board, but I still have very tiny strange shaped boobies.       I have no nipples but I did know that going in.                                                                           I had lots of numbness, and still some to this day.  I was told I would always have some, and some of it is in my back.  If they remove lymph nodes be very very careful lifting and injury to the hands and arms as to not get lymphedema.  I had 13 nodes removed 7 positive, I knew the risk of lymphedema, but got a very very small paper cut on my ring finger, I didnt think much of it as I was always washing my hands.  Low and behold 3 days later 3 fingers and part of my hand I have mild lymphedema.  The hardest part about having my breast removed is just like you think, not having breast.  I loved my boobies, sure I complained that they sagged and they were heavy, but they were mine.  And make no mistake I wanted to keep them.  So yes it is hard on some days that they are gone, I miss them, but also to be totally honest, I kinda like the fact that when it is hot I can just take off my bra and walla I am cooler~lol, or if they get too heavy.  So I try to focus on that.  I think I got used to not having them really early.  The first look in the Drs office was terrible.  Then I couldnt even look for quit a while.  I did not associate them with cancer, I associated them with me, with breastfeeding 4 children, with the fact that they helped me get a few boyfriends in my day, with the fact that they were my husbands favorite part of my body.  So yes that part is the hardest.  Physically it is a cake walk compared to chemo.   You will get through this.  Just another bump in the road.  Feel free to ask any questions here or via PM as sometimes this board is a bit too much for me to keep up on with chemo brain and all.  Hugs",

I havent slept all night, instead I was up puking.  So I am hungry and tired.  Pain meds are taking the edge of the pain off but not totally removing it.  Then this morning as I was getting my little ones ready to go to day care because I can not effectively take care of them today, I noticed I have fleas in my house.  I noticed the fleas on that cats I think last week and forgot to get them stuff for it.  Now I have to wash EVERYTHING in my house, vacuum, sweep, mop, everyday for 3 weeks straight.  I have no idea how I am going to do this as I cant to it once a month anymore let alone everyday.

I am a week out of tx #5, they dropped my Taxotere in half and wow what an improvement!  I can eat!  I don't feel like I am gonna puke every second.  I don't puke up all my food.  I have a bit of energy!  I still have lots of pain, but when you have energy and don't feel so out of control the pain is much more bearable.  I stopped wetting my pants (thank you God).  My feet are still a little screwy, but hey I cant ask for everything! There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I can see it!  2 weeks till my last (hopefully) chemo!  I thought I would NEVER feel this good again.  I really thought I wasn't going to make it!  I was so ready to just quit! I still cant sleep right, cant think right, but life is GOOD today! DH drew me a bath with candles, I laid in there for about an hour until I was falling fast asleep (figure get out before I drown~lol).  My kids were well behaved.  My oldest DS (who loves to give me a run for my money) was helpful all day.  My 14 DD didn't act like she was 14 today, she said Grace at dinner, then after dinner cleaned everything without being asked to and didn't want anything for it.  My little ones kept telling me how pretty I am that they love my new wig! I am the complainer here and I know it.  So sorry but most days I can barely stand being in my body.  So I thought I would share how terrific today was!  Thank you all so much for always being there for me.  I really don't know what I would do without all of you.  So much love!  Heres to hoping everyone has a day like I had today tomorrow and always. Smooches!  Oh yeah I asked the nurse what medication they give me to cause amnesia and she looked at me like I had 3 heads, and told me they don't. She thought it was just chemo brain.  I will ask the nurse practitioner that told me about them last week what it is when I see her next.  ONWARD!",

I know there are some of us still getting TC and other txs.  But are any of you just so tired of it that you are ready to quit?  I have 2 more txs and I kinda feel like a zombie walking to my next one tomorrow.  I feel so defeated.  More side effects, I just cant take much more.  I know it will be worse this time.  Not trying to sound negative, but history has been proven, each one gets worse and I get new SEs.  Pretty sure I got neorpathy last time, and I am terrrifed it is gonna come back and stay.  I am losing feeling in my right hand. I read how well all of you have done and I am sorry to say I envy you.  Dont get me wrong, I know it is hard for everyone.  But I have a hard time walking to the bathroom somedays and here some of you are running and walking miles daily.  I was not an incredibly fit person, before but I was no couch potato either.  I walked all day at my job, and exercised 3-4 days a week at curves.   It amazes me to see how well most of you do.  I have been out of work since surgery, and have no idea when I will return.  I hope rads is easier.",

Confirmed sever neuroapthy in my feet during last TX and mild in feet and right hand now.  We cut my Taxotere in half to avoid it becoming a permanent thing and altering my life in a bad way.   It is bad enough I am losing feeling in my hand (probably perm.) I dont want severe pain in my feet permanently! Also found out I am Grade 3 not 2, makes me wonder what else I wasnt brought up to speed on.    I was told I was going to need chemo before they did surgery.  I dont think that is the norm. is it?  I thought unless they knew the tumor was large over about 4cm, then they knew they wanted to to chemo, but besides that it would depend.  IDK, finding out I am stage 3 not 2 then grade 3 not 2 then this is the best one... I am given medication in with my chemo to give me amnesia!  I lost 5 days last round so I asked about it and sure enough was told I am being given meds to cause this.  For those of you for having surgery coming up! hang in there, if you can make it through chemo you can make it through anything.  Surgery was the easy part for me.   Yes you will be tired, and yes you are tired of being tired.  But sorry to say you are strong!  And you will make it through with flying colors!  Just think if this whiner for NJ can do it you can too!  I wish you gals/ and Tom could have seen me before this.  I was a fighter.  Now I am not a fighter I just show up.  So Ladies if you have no fight because you are too tired, just show up.  Much love to all of you as what you are walking into is not easy.  There are a ton of emotions.  I just showed up.  The surgery was the easy part, the chemo is not.  That is why I am so confident for all of you.  You will do great, you are already through the hardest physical part.  Much luv from NJ  hugs",

I still cant complete sentences, and mix things up all the time. Had to let you know the most embarrassing SE that is new this week.  Incontinence!  Yep, I feel the urge and there it goes!  I have resorted to buying those pads so I can at least go out in public.  Today seems better than Mon-Wed. but if it gets worse I will have to buy diapers.  Yesterday was soooooooo bad, I had to change my clothes 6 times even with the pads, so the next move is diapers.  OMG!  I thought it was embarrassing to have to use the little scooter at walmart, nothing compared to this. We are taking my 2 younger kids to the truck show Saturday.  It is an all day walking event, so my dad bought me a wheel chair so that I can make it, and if history repeats itself my feet will start hurting Saturday and pretty much be useless.  My poor kids summer has suxed so I hope this is a bit of fun for them. I will check into the drugs they give me to create amnesia, although I dont think they will tell me without a fight because they never told me about it until I asked.  I think it is a big secret, but when you lose 5 days of memory there is a problem!  Ummm maybe that is why some of us cant think straight, complete sentences, spell words.  I cant remember  ppls phone numbers that I call everyday.  I knew it was bad when I couldnt remember my moms number, it has been the same since I was 3. Who knows maybe next week I wont remember any of this~lol OXOXOX",

Before I had surgery they didnt know the size of the tumors exactly, but I guess they knew they were pretty small, well small enough they didnt need to do chemo before surgery.  But there was no question at all that I was getting chemo.  I was told by the BS in his office I will be getting it, the day I was told I have cancer.  I thought it depended on the size and your onco score (or what ever that is).  They did say something about my age being a factor.  Apparently the younger you are the worse it is, or something.  It was funny that I dont feel SO young and all I kept hearing is how young I am. So why was there never a question about it?  There was the question on if I would need rads; which I do because of the amount and size of the nodes. Anyway, Zuzee~Sorry you are having a hard time situating things.  I didnt work through TX.  I am glad I went out on leave when I did.  I never would have been able to work like this.  Especially my gross job.  But now my 6 month disability is about to end, and this will leave me with NO income until I go back.  I sure hope none of my SEs stick with me and that rads is easy enough for me to work through.  Or I can find a way to live on a lot less money.  Whatever~  At this point I dont care, I will find a way to make it just like you will.  Zoohouse~  Congratulations on finishing 6 rounds!  I love what you said about crawling out of your hole.  Yes that is how I feel with chemo.  Wishing you ease with surgery and continued herc.  Next week at this time I will be done with round 6 also, and hopefully done, but still not sure if Dr. will make me make up the lower dose of Taxotere I got last round.  God I hope not!  Hugs to all!",

And here is the bad news, they are radiating my arm pit along with my chest wall.  I already have mild lymphedema, and she warned me how much more at risk I am for it getting worse.  I will have to be very careful for the rest of my life as to not make it worse.  And she strongly recommends I do not ever go back to my job.   Needless to say I had a total melt down.  I have known for sometime I may not be able to return to my job, but today I heard it for sure.  I went to talk to the social worker (I know pretty much everyone at the cancer center) and I just lost it!  What am I supposed to do?  I am only 38!  SSDI will only approve you if your unable to do any job.  And only after my Drs say I am unable to work.  Then they make you see the SSDI Drs. who try to deny you.  I was assured I am not able to work for some time, and not able to return to my job unless I want to put my health in jeopardy.  I am not willing to do that.  As for any other job, we have to wait and see if the neuropathy gets better, or worse.  Wait and see if my pain goes away.  And wait and see if I will stop being a head case.   I go for my simulation on Monday the 2nd, and start on Monday the 9th.   I was told I am grieving.  Yeah I guess I am.

Justpayton1, Thanks for looking in on us. Kime, Does it hurt at all?  Tingle?   Lauren, I understand wanting to get it all gone, but Lymphedema is can be very serious.  I am fortunate that mine is so mild, but not pleasant and it hurts sometimes.    Check with your Dr. so that you get what you feel is best.  We all know that by now to go with our gut.  I dont want them to radiate my breast at all as I want recon one day (I think). I live in NJ too!  Kquigley, I too feel like I am in a fog.  I am 3 weeks out of chemo tomorrow.  I did 6 rounds of Taxotere and Cytoxan.  I had every side effect in the world I think.  I sure hope rads is better to my body.

Kime, thanks for letting me know it doesnt hurt.  It sounds like it will hurt dont you think?  Are you tired from it? Becky, WOW you have an interesting case.  It amazes me how complicated this disease can be.  I thought mine was interesting with ILC, IDC and DCIS.  They just gave you cancer soup.  Did the tattoos hurt?  I dont know why I am asking as I have a few on my own, but I am such a wimp lately.

What do they have you on?  They take the edge off, just not all the way.  I have been on pain meds since my 2nd dose of chemo (I think) because of the nerve damage it did to me.  After my break last week, I continued to get more red.  About an hour after tx yesterday the pain kicked in full force again.  I am now peeling in more spots. I too leave skin everywhere, I cover my pillow cases and sleep on a towel to avoid any creams and dead skin from ruining my nice new sheets~lol.  I am about 5 different colors, red, pink, bright red, purple and literally black in some spots. My back is turning color now too!  When I lift my arm you can see the skin pulling.  I am trying to do my arm exercises but they are getting tougher to do, I feel pulling in not only my arm pit but my entire chest wall.  The most comfortable way for my arm to be is kinda like a guy whos muscules are too big for him to put his arm down.  I walk around the house like that, it is pretty funny.  I will be attending Christmas Eve and Christmas with the families with no bra, so no boobs.  It just hurts to bad to even think about putting it on.  SU@KS The only thing that helps sooth me is Aquaphor,  maybe you can try it.  I slather it on and rub, rub, rub, it helps for a while, but dear God is it messy and gross.  But hey it makes me feel a little better for a little while, till I cant take how gross it feels and have to shower~lol I didn't have any boosts but I had bolus every other day, up until last Tuesday.  I am going today just to be done!  I really wonder what does another 2 txs do?  But I will be a good girl and finish. Anna~  I am so happy for you!  Doing the happy dance!  Happy happy Joy joy!  Congrats!  Congrats! Congrats! Lauren~ How is your energy levels?  Are you feeling any better?  Let me know there is hope!  It must be so great to be DONE!  Thank you for the prayers, we all need them. Deb~ I hope your blast of energy stays as well!  Make sure you do your arm exercises.   I feel like I am in the body of a 90 year old woman!  And I hope one day I will be saying I am 90!   Much Love as always!  Here is to us all living to be 103!  Deb",

We have an advantage now that we have this God awful DISease, we know more about our choice of words.  Not that we are perfect, but we definitely (at least I do) think before we speak much more.

Yes, praying for a cure as someone has decided to stop medical treatment are exactly the comments I am talking about.  Or did she try this or that?  I also hate the phrase \"she lost her battle\", SHE DID NOT LOSE ANYTHING!  The medical professions and insurance companys FAILED HER!  We are all unbelievably strong Women and we dont Lose anything.",

I (and most of us) never said anything about anyone being stupid, or wrong thread, just to please be respectful. Magister~ yep you get it.   Christy~ yep you get it. Hope2~ Sorry I have to disagree.  First of all stage lll is advanced Bc, not early.  Most stage 3ers do not know the exact part of stage 3 we are, bringing a different anguish all together.  Your comment \"we can all end up stage lv\" is exactly the insensitive comment I am talking about.  That is as insensitive as someone without bc saying \"oh well I can end up with bc anyday\".  Yes we all KNOW that.  Yes there is a BIG difference between stage 3 and stage 0.  But that is not the intention of this thread.   Barb~ Your true colors came through!  YOU ARE A CLASS ACT!  Much love to you sister.  Glad you are having a bit of a better day.  Damn this DISease!  We all go through so much.  Thank you for educating me on another type of BC I had no idea.  That must have been terrifying for you to go through all of this with your Dr.s not \"knowing\" much about it.  Thank you for not flipping out.  Really, Thank you.  Hope everyone has a great Valentines Day! ",

The nurse that told me that was supposed to fax over the results to my OBGYN on Friday never did.  So tomorrow I am calling and demanding she fax them to me.    From everything that I have read here and on the web in general until they do the biopsy they cant tell anything for sure.  So even if the report does not look favorable it could be nothing.   Thank you all for being so kind.  I am keeping positive right now and hopefully wont lose my mind today.",

Tuesday that now I need a stereotatic core biopsy (mammotome).  Mammo shows triangle shaped stellate breast lesion.  Then the nurse tells me that she can't tell me the results of the MRI because she is not a Dr. and it does not look favorable.  My BS is out until Tuesday, so she forwarded my results to my OBGYN so he can at least speak with me tomorrow.  I go for the biopsy this coming Tuesday and to see the BS the following Tuesday.  I do not deal well with stress (I know none of us do) but I am losing it!  I requested my family Dr. give me some Zanex so I can get through this a little easier, she never called it in.  I am tired but cant sleep, I am hungry but cant eat.  My husband is not dealing with this well; he won't talk to me about it.  I know he is terrified, but so am I and this is my body.  Sorry to ramble on and on but I really feel like I have no one to talk to.  If anyone has had similar dealings please let me know.  I want to know what to expect.  I am sorry if I come across angry, I am just so scared.

Before I had surgery they didnt know the size of the tumors exactly, but I guess they knew they were pretty small, well small enough they didnt need to do chemo before surgery.  But there was no question at all that I was getting chemo.  I was told by the BS in his office I will be getting it, the day I was told I have cancer.  I thought it depended on the size and your onco score (or what ever that is).  They did say something about my age being a factor.  Apparently the younger you are the worse it is, or something.  It was funny that I dont feel SO young and all I kept hearing is how young I am. So why was there never a question about it?  There was the question on if I would need rads; which I do because of the amount and size of the nodes. And... I am gonna be put on Tamoxifen for 3 years, then 8 years of something else.  Onc. says we will decide what at the time.  But 8 years; 11 years total.  OMG is anyone else getting told they will have that tx for that long?",

I start Chemo on June 22nd.  Dr. wanted me to start the week b4 but I told her my daughters 8th grade graduation was that week and I dont want to be under the weather so I will be beginning my sickness then.  I say that because I dont feel sick yet.  Oh boy I cant wait.  All summer sick.  Yuck awareness find a cure! And Cathi I love your \"Sexy is definded by attituded not bra size\"  I just really have to start believing it.  I am working on it.",
