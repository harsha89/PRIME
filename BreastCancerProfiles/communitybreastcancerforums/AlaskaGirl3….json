So I have to drive 3 hours to Anchorage or fly up for any testing. I got my MRI, mammogram, & u/s reports. My BIRADS is 4a. So still pretty hopeful it's benign. I am scheduled for my MRI guided biopsy on 4/2. Most likely will have results back the next day. They're pretty quick with pathology reports.",

Over course that's probably because of the Xanax they gave me ;) In the mean time; I've had a thyroid issue come up. It became quite enlarged after starting meds. So I am headed back to the hospital on Tuesday for a thyroid ultrasound. Thank God we have good insurance!",
