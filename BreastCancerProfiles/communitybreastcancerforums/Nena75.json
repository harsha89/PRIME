I am 42 and have two boys, ages 14 and 13. I don't want to tell any one to not worry them, but in the mean time I feel like I want to scream.

I try to remain positive and busy as to not think too much. I haven't told anyone except for my husband, as to not worry them. I wish you the best and stay positive.",
