Something that sounded ok near the time of my infusion (like pancakes) has now become so revolting to me I can barely think about it. When I realized that was happening, I stuck to boring/bland foods that I almost never eat: white bread, canned fruit and soups, protein drinks. Nothing tasted all that good anyway, so why play Russian roulette with my future appetite?",

You and I have very similar diagnoses--even the same breast. I just finished chemotherapy less than three weeks ago, and none of this seems real some days. It happens fast! The best advice I've gotten was from one of my first BC nurses, who told me to get ANY negative people or attitudes out of my life. That was something that helped. It may not feel like it right now, but...YOU GOT THIS!  ",
