I have looked at the skin mets info and it sounds (and looks) like that is often more red and rash-like. I don't want to worry if it isn't necessary, but I now have about 5 small, raised brown spots near the top bit of my nipple that was left after the mastectomy. I didn't have much of a skin reaction to radiotherapy, and it is now just over 3 months since my treatment ended. Anyone with similar experiences? Or any other info? Thanks in advance M Log in to post a reply",
