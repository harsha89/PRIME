I'm in canada, infobabe.  SpecialK, that's what I had read as well about DCIS. When I asked my dr. if I should be less worried because the prognosis is so good she said no because they think it may have spread to surrounding tissue. She also said that I'm so young so they think it may be particularly aggressive. So I don't know why she's telling me this and not telling my why they think that other than the age factor.  Thank you both for replying to my post. It's so helpful to talk with other women who are or have dealt with this. ",

I was told I have DCIS and that the doctors are very concerned that it's aggressive and it's probably spread to other tissue.  I'm so scared right now. I don't know what stage I'm at and my consult with the surgeon isn't until May 1st. Shouldn't the biopsy have told my doctor what stage and how aggressive this cancer is? And does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? The waiting is killing me but at the same time I don't want to know.  Dx 4/17/2014, DCIS, Right, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
