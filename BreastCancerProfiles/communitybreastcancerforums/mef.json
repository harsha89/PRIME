I hope that you are keeping your spirits up and that the treatment will go well for you. I'm on a dairy free diet and am juicing I don't know whether it is to keep me positive but I feel that I am doing something to take control of the situation and not let the cancer control me all the time. I am glad to hear that you have felt ok  except for the check ups hopefully you will be back on your feet soon after the chemo and op . I am juicing a head of broccoli every day after I heard about a guy that has kept his prostrate cancer at bay for 5 years when the doctors didn't think that he would survive. This is in the united kingdom where I live, It was in the newspapers earlier this week and now the cancer research uk want his receipe  to see what 's in it. - carrot broccoli and apples. Anyway i hope that everything goes well for you mef",
