And we seriously must have had the same doctor at first because that is how my appt had gone! \"I want to act fast since we don't have much information except that you have cancer\" and \"If the surgeon says he can't get you in for the lumpectomy by next week, let me know, because you WILL be having surgery next week!\" I was like HOLD UP!! Why would I go through with a lumpectomy if I'm going to have to turn around and have a dmx anyways! I have a lot of BC on both my mom and dads side, so I think my surgery decision is already made for me! Also, I'm a fire fighter so the less time that I'm off of work, the better!! How is your husband doing with all of this? My fiance is having a really hard time with it and I also think that he is almost scared to touch me. I flat out told him that there is time limit on how much longer I will have my boobs...he better take advantage of that :) Stay healthy, get plenty of rest and keep that chin up momma!! You and all of these other beautiful ladies are in my thoughts and prayers!!",

I get through all of my hard times using humor, (I told my guy, that before long, his boobs were going to be bigger than mine!). Clint has been super supportive, he is just so scared that he is not able to joke about it. We caught it early, so I'm hoping that it is contained. I found out today that my BRCA test was negative, so it looks like I am just a random person that I got cancer! When my best friend was dx with a brain tumor, she asked me to shave her head...that was so much harder than I thought it was going to be. We cried and we laughed! I really pray that your treatment is gentle on your body and your spirit. As far as losing your hair and any other side effects that you might have, just try to find something positive to take away from it. Cry when you need to cry, laugh when you need to laugh, but most importantly, KEEP ON FIGHTING!! And remember, no one fights alone! Use family and friends to help you along the way. You can also message me if you want to, I would be glad to lend you a shoulder!! Our roads are going to get a little bumpy, but rest not my new friend, we will get through this! Two things that I live by: Philippians 4:13 and Proverbs 31:25",

This site and the women on here are so great and I'm thankful I found the site. I will let you all know what I find out today...wish me luck!! Xoxo ",

That has by far, been the worst of this so far (which is easy to say since I haven't even met with my onco yet!). Seeing the fear and hurt in the kids' eye's just killed me! My oldest son is 26 and lives in St. Louis- six hours from me- so unfortunately I had to tell him and his wife while Skyping... not easy! My daughter, 25, took it the best and has been to one of my appointments with me. My baby boy, 21, is in the Navy, stationed in Jacksonville, Fl, took it the absolute worst. Oddly enough, I was set to go see him 3 days after I received my dx, so I waited until I was face-to-face with him. My fiance is still kind of a mess and I feel he's in denial (he won't even read through the pamphlet that was given to me by my gyno). I on the other hand have a positive outlook and I'm ready to get this ball rolling! Its so hard for me, not having any answers yet. I'm awaiting my BRCA results, which most likely won't make a difference since I'm pretty sure that I will be going for a double mastectomy anyway. To date, the only info I have is a bad mammo and my biopsy report saying that I have DCIS, ER+...to which my gyno said \"thats just what we are calling it right now\". He told me that we don't know how aggressive this could be or if it has spread since the biopsy sample was small. He sent me to a surgeon who said the opposite. He said that it has not spread and its not aggressive (this guy was not a people-person and was very rude)! Sooooo, that is when I decided to do some checking and found a respected onco in Wichita, Ks. The only problem with that is, the absolute soonist she could squeeze me in is Oct. 26th...so I wait! Until then, I try every day to give my stress and anxiety up to God! Some days it works, some days it doesn't!! All I know is that we must remember to take things one day at a time...and remember to breathe momma <3",

I see an oncologist on the 26th and feel that my anxiety will get the best of me before that day! Telling my three kids was so damn hard. You can do this, use your family and friends to help you with passing the time! Keep your chin up honey and stay strong!!",
