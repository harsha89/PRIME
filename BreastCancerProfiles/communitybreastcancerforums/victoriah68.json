I am going to have a central duct excision and skin biopsy. I am trying to look up info on it and not finding much of anything. I don't understand why it is so hard to find more information. Has anyone been thru this before? How painful or not painful was the recovery? Anything you can tell me to make this not so unknown and scary is a help. I hate going into things blind.
