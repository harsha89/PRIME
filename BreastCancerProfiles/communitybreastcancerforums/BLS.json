Find a great TEAM. You will need a surgeon, an oncologist and a Mental Health support group. Find out what TYPE and stage you are too. Ask for onco testing, mammoprint and KI 67 rate too. Get a binder and keep track of everything. Try to rest and remain calm. One day at a time and you will make it! Brandi",

I have had a lipoma before that was a scare, but it was moveable and this one isn't. Friday seems like forever and then I suspect they will order tests making me wait another week before I can have them. Wishing I could just run in now. Feeling horrified. Do you know anything about mets to ribs? Thanks",

I'm going to the MO on Friday, meanwhile I'm ready to have a stroke, b/c I'm worried I have METS. Can this be anything else? I had my last surgery in Oct. 2015, when they took out my expanders and put in my silicone implants. Any thoughts? Thanks, BLS",

I'm having extreme left jaw pain and I'm scheduled for CT scan of jaw next week.I also have a lump on my tounge (area of tongue deep in the throat) and I have a surgical tongue biopsy scheduled for next week too. All the research points to is Mets. I can't find much on here for jaw or tongue mets. I feel so alone and lost. Does anyone know anything about this? Thanks, BLS",
