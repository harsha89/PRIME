I do wonder if I need to switch doctors, as he is a general surgeon)    I still have one complex cyst in my \"good breast\"  that they feel we can just watch.  ",

I try bringing a list, but I still think of something as soon as I walk out.   Thanks for bringing up this question regarding follow-up, because I've had questions of my own as to what is standard and I'll follow the replies with interest.  Best wishes to you.",
