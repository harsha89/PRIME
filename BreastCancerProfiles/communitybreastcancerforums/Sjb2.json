      "Content": "Sjb2 wrote: I am 40 years old and went in for my first mammogram. I was surprised that I was called back in for a second set of mammograms on both breasts and an ultra sound on my right breast. Then a few days later I found out that I needed to have two biopsies. My right breast had a solid mass and I had an ultra sound guided biopsy done. My left breast had highly suspicious micro calcifications and I had a stereotactic biopsy done. My gynecologist called me with the results and they concluded that the right breast is a fibroadenoma. The left breast is not cancerous now but high risk for breast cancer so my gynecologist has suggested I go see a general surgeon to see if they recommend taking more tissue to test with a surgical biopsy. My doctor did recommend a general surgeon in my town but I am wondering if I should go to Colorado for the consultation. I live in Wyoming,which is pretty small, and I can't help but wonder if going into a bigger city would be beneficial or if it really matters. Does anyone have any thoughts on getting the consolation in a small town verses a bigger town? Log in to post a reply",

I was referred to a breast surgeon and yesterday I spend the whole day at the hospital. Because the clip didn't hold during the biopsy I had to go in to ultra sound before surgery so they could put two wires into my breast. Each one marked tissuebthat was to be removed. Then off to surgery. Surgery was quick and coming out of anesthesia wasn't too bad. The doctor told my husband that she got all the tissue and it went well. Now I wait for the results. Waiting is the worst. I came home at about 4 pm on Thursday. It is now 433 am in Friday and I have only been able to sleep about 2 hours. I don't know if it is the stress of waiting or why I can't sleep. Any ideas on how to help get some rest Log in to post a reply",
