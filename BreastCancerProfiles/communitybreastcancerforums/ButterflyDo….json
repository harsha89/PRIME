I could see the radiologist measuring the lump in my breast and also under my arm. Not saying anything of course.Then the doctor comes in and tells me to come back for a core biopsy. I am currently awaiting the results as its been the weekend then a public holiday, dam i need to know as I am so worried. My husband is away at the moment 1500km away as his daughter from previous marriage has cystic fibrosis and she received double lungs and also a kidney transplant. Her kidney is only working at 50 % at the moment so we are hoping she can receive another kidney transplant. I haven't worried my husband about my discovery of the lump or what I am going through at the moment. I should have my results tommorrow. I really don't know how I will tell him over the phone if the news is bad. I feel so scared and alone at this time. I also have a daughter with cystic fibrosis that needs me so I don't have time to be ill. Praying that tommorrow is good news.",
