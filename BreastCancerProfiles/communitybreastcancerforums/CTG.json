Duke Cancer Center is rated number 9 in the USA so you are in a good state. These are the NCI approved centers in your state: University of North Carolina UNC Lineberger Cancer Center at Chapel Hill NC Duke University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Durham NC Wake Forest Comprehensive Center Winston Salem NC To see all the NCI Centers in the USA click on this link: To see the top 100 Cancer centers in USA click on this link: http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/best-hospitals/search.php?spec=ihqcanc I have had a second opinion and treatment at MD Anderson, I can share with you my experience. First your oncologist can contact any cancer center to arrange a consult or you can call New Patient services. You will need to give them your insurance information first. Once your insurance is approved you will be told what to send in regards to your case. The pathology glass slides and records maybe required first. You can get your pathology glass slides from the place that did your biopsy. Usually there is a wax cassette that contains your tumor and glass slides of the original biopsy, these items are kept safe for 10 yrs by the pathology department. You also will need all current films and reports of your case including a full list of all treatments done to date. Once you have an appointment with a second opinion you still may be required to have additional tests done. This is because each cancer center has standards that are all different. The diagnostic tests done locally may not be accepted at the second opinion as the standards are different. Some centers restage you completely to see if any thing has been over looked. I have to agree this is a good thing. I experienced first hand how an experienced top center found additional cancer that my local hospital missed. I am forever grateful for the proper diagnosis of my 2nd opinion. If I had not had this proper diagnosis my outcome today would not be the success story that it is. I would suggest that in your case no matter where you go most cancer centers have patient travel services you can contact. Some have discounted rates on hotels and lodging. Also the American Cancer Society has Hope Lodges located in some cities you can contact them to see if one is near the hospital you choose. The national number is 800 ACS 2345 I truly wish you the best. Having a 2nd opinion in stage 4 cancer is much needed as there are wonderful clinical trials and options available.

First you need to know that there are many of us living with cancer for many years and some even have remission so there is hope! It sounds like the oncologist is ordering all these tests to \u2018restage' your mother.  This is done to see exactly where the cancer is in order to properly treat her. Expect these tests to be done: PET Scan, Cat Scan of abdomen and chest, MRI of the Brain, MRI of the Spine and other areas, these tests are needed to see what is going on. Also blood tests called Tumor Markers will be done in addition to other general blood tests. Pathology tests are done using the biopsy of the bone or tumor to look for what is called \u2018Receptors.' Receptors fuel cancer growth and when you have a receptor show positive there are targeted drugs for them. There are different 3 receptors: Estrogen, Progesterone and the Her 2 onco gene. Each receptor is different and there are drugs available for these receptors. The \u2018FISH' pathology test is a specific test done to check if the cancer is Her2 positive. The FISH test is the best test for Her2 that we have so its good the doctor has ordered it. There are options to help mothers pain ranging from pain medication to radiation, or possibly surgery. I can relate to the bone pain issue as I have had this too. I can tell you the bone pain does stop when treatment is successful. In my case I had significant bone pain in March of this year, but it stopped once my new chemotherapy treatment started. I have even had bones that have shown to be healing on my scans. There are many chemotherapy treatment options available. Once the test results determine the receptor status then the drugs will be decided. I would also suggest having a 2nd opinion at a major cancer center as they have the most experience. Here is a web link to the NCI approved centers. These are leading cancer institutions of our country offering the best health care our nation has to offer. You can look up by state. Questions to ask How much experience does this doctor have in treating stage 4 bc patients? Is this doctor a breast specialist instead of a regular oncologist? Does this doctor attend breast cancer seminars that keep doctors up to date in the latest treatments? Conferences such as ASCO or the San Antonio Breast Symposium; both of which are extremely informative about drug trials and information about new drugs. How available is this doctor to the patients? Is there a way to reach the doctor after hours? How so? Are there other patients she can meet that are currently in treatment to ask about their experience? Are there support groups local or in hospital for her to attend? What are the receptors that showed positive if any, and what drugs will be used for them? What chemotherapy drug will be used and has it shown to be effective these types of mets. Are there any clinical trials offered?  What is the leading breast oncology center close by that offers trials? What did the blood tests show as far as tumor marker levels? Which tumor markers did were used? There are 2 common ones cea and ca27-29 (These are used to trend the response to the drugs, done every few weeks or at least once a month) Is there a pain management to offer possible drugs and physical therapy? How will the spine be monitored? Using a MRI of spine to monitor for fractures? What tests will be done to monitor bone mets? How often will there be scans? How often will there be blood tests or tumor markers? I would suggest you take a tape recorder to this doctors appointment.  I regularly tape my doctor appointments as this helps me remember all that was said. You can use one of those micro types sold at many stores, get a few 60 minute tapes as the first meeting can go over an hour. I can not think of anymore questions at this point. I think the most important thing is to find a breast oncologist that treats many stage 4 patients if possible. The more experienced and well informed the doctor the better the treatment options. This is why I always say get a 2nd opinion at a major cancer center that is approved by the NCI as they are the best. Have hope there are so many of us living with cancer and able to function well.

It is my understanding wbr is done only once, however I think targeted radiation such as gamma knife or stereotactic radiosurgery is possible.  I do know that some have necrosis from the tumors and that scar tissue shows as growth. I would suggest getting a 2nd opinion from a Neurosurgeon at a major cancer center that is NCI approved.  Here is a web-link to look up your state to find one. http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/cancer-centers-list.html Also recently while reading the posts on the her2 group of the  http://www.her2support.org/ website I did read of someone who has brain mets with the tumor growing and it seems possible that this happens and leads to the tumor shrinking later, as this is how her prior tumors reacted.  I would also suggest maybe Tykerb be tried as it can cross the blood barrier of the brain.   I wish you the best and you are in my thoughts.

If you are worried about waiting 6 months for a rescan then ask for some tumor markers to be done immediately. Ask for the cea and ca 27-29 tumor markers to monitor over the next few months. I am sure your oncologist will allow this to ease your mind. Wishing you the best. Hugs Ctg dx fall05 stage4 liver and bone mets dx fall06 brain mets / spring07 brain mets gone",

The Tykerb is still in trials in many countries as this was just approved here for prescription use in the USA in March. Look for the drug name \u2018Lapatinib' this is Tykerb as it is offered in Trials through out the world. In regards to treatment of brain mets. I can tell you 5mm is still very small so that is good, it looks like you caught that one early. Treatment depends on 3 things; the size of the tumor, the location of the tumor and finally the neurosurgeons opinion and experience. I would suggest you get a 2nd opinion as Whole Brain Radiation for 1 tumor seems extreme. It is hard to know why exactly in your case WBR was recommended. You really need to ask the neurosurgeon to explain the benefits of whole brain radiation vs. targeted treatments such as gamma knife or stereotactic radiosurgery. After meeting a few neurosurgeons and having lengthy discussions I did learn a lot. I was told you can treat multiple brain tumors using gamma knife or stereotactic radiosurgery, however there are limits. Again it depends on size and location, but say less than 4 tumors would allow for possible stereotactic radiosurgery or gamma knife. Another option is having targeted treatments and saving WBR for later if needed. This is done quite often here. I truly wish you the best sister! Hang in there and keep your chin up. Let me know what you decide in your case. Hugs Ctg dx fall05 stage4 liver and bone mets dx fall06 brain mets / spring07 brain mets gone",

I was diagnosed with brain mets in my cerebellum last year. I learned the best defense in fighting brain mets is finding the best Neurosurgeon that you can to review your case. Look for one that treats brain mets on a daily basis. Ask questions as to how many breast cancer patients are treated and what is the success rate. I suggest you see a Neurosurgeon at one of the major cancer centers that is NCI approved as these are the leading hospitals in the USA with the most experience. I also suggest you get 2 opinions. See the link to search your area. There are many choices and options depending on the size and location of your brain mets. The location and size will determine what treatment options you have. I had to choose between Gamma Knife and Stereotactic Radiosurgery. I had 2 opinions. I was given a tour of each treatment facility. However  I chose the Stereotactic Radiosurgery because of the quality assurance of the team involved. I met with the Neurosurgeon as well as the Radiation Oncologist and the whole team. I felt confident that my decision was the right one. I had doctors that showed compassion and a real passion for treating me. My overall treatment was one day. I suffered no cognitive or physical side effects from the Stereotactic Radiosurgery treatment. One month later I had a Brain MRI; it showed the tumors were shrinking and responding to treatment. The following month showed continue shrinkage and one complete response. By March all tumors were completely gone. I know this is a scary time for you, you are not alone sister. I can tell you there are many of us that have treated our brain mets successfully. If you are Her2+ please ask about the drug Tykerb as this has shown to cross into the brain barrier.   Hang in there for there is Hope, Sending you hugs.
