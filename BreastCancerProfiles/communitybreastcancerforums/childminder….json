Injecting the dye is a really simple procedure, not really painful, just like having a normal injection. You should be absolutely fine to drive home afterwards.     I was allowed home the same day as the surgery.  Be warned that you will have blue wee for a few days and a blue patch on yr boob which can last for several month.  I recovered from the small op after only a few days. You should get the results from the biopsy roughly 2 weeks after operation. I am scheduled for a full mastectomy with reconstructive surgery on Friday.   Good luck on Wednesday and keep positive - it has certainly kept me going.
