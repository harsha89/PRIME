I did talk to the surgeon and they did local with sedation!  It was great, and the recovery time was minimal of course the pain was pretty bad though!  I found hot baths to be the only helpful thing really.  And very comfy sports bras.  Bad news all around though.  A few days ago I lost the baby, and today I got the results that it is borderline.  This is tough!  I was starting to get so excited, and felt like it happened for a reason.  My emotions are just swinging all over the place.  They are going to take out even more of the breast, and I have the option to follow up with radiation, though my doctor said that it is most commonly used with fully malignant phyllodes tumors.  I'm going to do local again, because it made the recovery super easy.   I would reccomend it for anyone who wants to have a quick recovery time.   Thankfully, all my doctors are fantastic and very supportive.  I really need to do some research now on the whole radiation option... I would love some more imput!  Thanks to every single person who replied, it really helps, I dont know anyone who has gone through this.  I did get a very adorable kitten, and dyed my hair pink.  both of which seem to be helping haha.",
