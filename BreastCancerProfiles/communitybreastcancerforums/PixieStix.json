I'm freaking out because for one I'm 14 weeks pregnant and two, my mom was diagnosed with TNBC at the age of 32 and died exactly 30 days after her 36th birthday, I'm extremely high high risk for breast cancer to the point where where some doctors will not prescribe me birth control. I've been getting ultrasounds on my breasts since I was 23 and I perform manual exams all the time my doctor found a lump that was in the exact same place as a large cyst I've always had and known about.I got an ultrasound done to confirm that I had an irregular shaped mass growing on top of the cyst and they also found a smaller mass on the same breast with much different characteristics. The smaller mass they reassured me was probably a benign growth due to its shape, but they decided to biopsy both. I'm just worried because no one will comment on the irregular growth and they also requested a rush on results. In my heart I know it's cancer I try to think positive but I just can't.

I just feel silly for preparing myself for the worst. I'm just ready for the confirmation so I can move forward and do whatever it is I need to do",
