I know you're right really. Think I'm just going through part of a grieving process. Thought I was going to lose my right breast. Okay. Didn't realise I would (kind of ) lose my main hobby for life (I ballroom dance/ 'used to' ?! ... no... can't bring myself to say that yet....! and was jiving energetically...and being lifted upside down and doing all sorts of lifts....) I know I can go back to doing some dancing...probably /hopefully lots... but competitions will be out :( (I guess I just hadn't factored this in and been prepared for this loss too...) Probably sounds ridiculous to mention when there are more important things to worry about.",

I'd been dealing with grieving for boob... but just hadn't got my head around the impact of ? possibly having to grieve for dancing too. Thanks for sharing your experience and thoughts. I'm still waiting for appointment with physiotherapist. Apparently it might be 4 -6 weeks. Guess I might have to look in to finding one privately. I used to be really flexible on both sides of body and am finding it really hard to think about all the 'what ifs'! Best of luck with your recovery/getting back on track. Sounds like you have a good physiotherapist if she is working with you so well.",

Very gratefully received.... :) Also... am trying to decide whether or not to accept radiotherapy... if all the cancer was killed by the chemotherapy (the pathologist apparently said the cancerous cells were no longer 'live' ....then is there really any need for radiotherapy too?)...

I've been very frustrated here (UK) by not being able to access physio very easily.... just getting through to someone on phone at hosp can take an age... Have been confused too by not wanting to overstretch too soon (as you've pointed out) and also not wanting to miss a window of 'if you don't stretch early enough your arm will only ever have that limited restricting reach?!' ... so yes...I will go and look up the lymphedema boards on this site about exercise and giving lymph area time to heal. Havent even had any leaflets yet about exercises to do or avoid... feel am having to do all my own information-finding online... just wish I'd started so much earlier... ie as soon as had diagnosis..... not after chemo and after surgery!! But I have daughters ....so ....really hoping they never need to research similar online...but...at least another time I will tell them to go online as soon as poss!! :) :)",
