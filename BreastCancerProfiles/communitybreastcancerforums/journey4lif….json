I don't have a sleeve and have not been given any instruction on wrapping. I am so disheartened and sick of all this crap that comes with BC... ",

Any suggestions on transitioning from right-handed to left? :)",

I have been going to an LE therapist for two weeks now. She wanted to see me daily for 2 weeks but I couldn't afford to take that much time off work and would also have to pay my insurance co-pay of $20 at every visit. So, we agreed on a MWF schedule. I have Stage 1 LE and early stage cording. I've been fitted for a sleeve and gauntlet and will probably order them on Monday. Did anyone purchase from LympheDIVAS? Some of the designs are so not me but I've narrowed my choices down to a couple. I'm not seeing a tremendous difference yet in swelling reduction but I can tell the range of motion in my arm is better. I can certainly tell I'm doing the correct exercises - I can \"feel\" each of them! Hope you all are doing well. Again I thank you for the advice and support. LE has become an added feature to my new normal and I'm going to make the best of it. TGIF!",

I talked to RO today and he affirmed that my request for a scan is reasonable one. Given my risk factors, even though I've been dx \"early stage\", I have a valid concern about whether surgery, chemo and rads were effective. He cautioned that any number of cancer cells below billions would probably not be detected on a PET or CT scan, so cells could be present but not detectable. He thought it was rare that women dx with BC have scans at all until they are symptomatic. Based on what some of you have shared, I wonder if that statement is true. He also mentioned the NCCN recommendations and how they drive treatment providers. He thinks I should have a heart-to-heart talk with my MO (by the way, RO and MO know each other), explaining my reasons and my fears and my MO may change his mind. RO also said that I should wait a couple of months after the end of RADS to get any type of scan because there will probably be a false positive in the radiated areas. So now I have a couple of months to collect information to \"prove\" my case to my MO!

As mzmerz and coolbreeze found out, mets don't always cause pain. It could be growing now and I'd never know it!
