Have most of you had surgery prior to treatment?  I feel like I'm the only one sometimes who hasn't had surgery yet.  My onc wanted to do the chemo first to \"make sure it works\".  I had a pretty aggressive puppy (around 2 inches in diameter within a year), plus two that were a bit close to the chest wall.  My on wanted to shrink it first to make surgery easier/better.  Although, I don't always understand that b/c I have opted for the bilateral (no one can recreate the perfection in my left breast! haha) Anyhow....I'm in pretty good spirits most of the time.  I have found the humor in all of this.  Making my family members quite uncomfortable (and then loosening up) is so incredibly amusing to me.  Hey, they're boobs.  We all have them.  Plus, I'm lucky - I love my wig (and so does the almost DH).  Don't get me wrong, when I\"m home, I'm topless, but out and about I rock the wig or a scarf (usually the wig).  At some point, I'll go out of the house topless...but it's patchy....SUPER PATCHY.  I honestly want the hair on my head to just go already!  Speaking of hair, I haven't minded not having to shave anything below my neck in forever :)  That's been AWESOME.  I'm purposely trying my best not to touch my eyebrows or eyelashes....they're still there, but I haven't waxed my eyebrows in 2 months...and, uh, I haven't really needed to.  Uh oh....hoping for a miracle. On a side note, the Pink Heals Tour is coming to my town in a few weeks....I'm excited.  Pink firetrucks?  And firefighters?  SIGN ME UP! Anyhow, have a good night, all.  I'm so glad to have such a large group of women in the \"club we never wanted to join\"!",

I agree with everything Cats is saying....here are a few things I picked up....I didn't buy mastectomy specific clothing....I figured I didn't want to waste a lot of money (in my eyes) on something I would only wear for a few weeks. Oversized button down shirts...I purchased a bunch of men's shirts from thrift stores and washed them a few times. I pinned the drains to these shirts...well, because I didn't care about the pins showing nor ruining the shirts. The hospital gave me a mastectomy frank with pockets, but I had 5 drains...it only really fit 3 comfortably. If you don't like to feel the drains, men's undershirts tanks (aka: wife beaters). I cut down the armpits so. I could get them on and off easier. Pinning the drains to these didn't work well, but it kept the drains from touching my skin. Wedge pillow. This was a life saver. Completely uncomfortable and expensive for how long I used it, but awesome with a bunch more pillows on top. Bolster pillows. These were awesome and on clearance at bed bath and beyond when I went. They are the perfect under arm and under knee (helped me get comfy during sleep) pillows. FYI....my face trick...I used a bathing suit top in the shower....tied the neck piece up, safety pinned the drains to the bottom and voila....shower time and I could move completely free. Don't pack a lot for the hospital...I didn't put anything on other than the socks and gown they gave me. I did bring a blanket that I used. Oh, I also took some of the hospital gowns home too, it was helpful during the first few days home when I was timid about dressing and when I was, well, lazy!",

Neulasta wasn't great, I got pain in my hips. But, a trick I heard and got the ok from my onc, taking allegra the day of the shot helped. Ask your onc to see if you can try it. I am not going to lie to you, chemo sucks, big time. But I found the humor in life, the sweetness coming from people I never expected, and love from all directions. And that is what got me through such a terrible crappy thing like chemo.",

So...I'm doing pretty well right now.  I'm changing from my dose dense AC treatments to platinol & taxotere next week (every 3 weeks).  So, I got an extra week to recouperate and I'm pretty darn happy about it.  Although, I'm not so pleased that chemo will go through the end of the year.  And I'm one of the odd ones, I am not going for surgery until AFTER chemo.  So 2012 is going to start off pretty rough and end up awesome! Anyhow, that's not really what I need to vent about.  My birthday is coming up and we had some friends and family over for a pizza & pajama party (I highly suggest it...you're close to your bed and already in jammies if you get tired!).  Anyhow, my best friend.  BEST FRIEND...got me clothes to be comfy in.  Great, huh?  Um, the problem is that she got it all at least one size too big.  She had to give me a disclaimer when I opened it saying \"I wanted you to be comfy, don't mind the size, I figured bigger would be more comfy\".  Um, but one of them was a cotton dress.  Really?  I mean, sweats I would understand, but a dress? I guess I'm just really frustrated because we're already having enough self esteem issues as it is (piled on to any self esteem issues we had prior to the big C), and she thinks I'm that big?  Ugh, I feel like I'm a crazed woman, good thing I'm not getting my period b/c it would totally be PMS.  Sigh...thanks for listening. xoxo  kick some butt, ladies (like my Steelers are right now!)",
