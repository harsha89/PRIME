I've always thought I had a fairly high tolerance for pain, but this is really getting to me. I also get exhausted. Everyone keeps saying that my body is using all its energy to heal. Is that true? Would PT help? I've tried to resume as much of my regular schedule as possible (walking, housework, etc). I've read on other posts how women return to work at 2 weeks, etc., etc., and I feel like I'm being a real baby with this surgery. Thanks for any advice!

It's so reassuring to hear similar stories, I was under anesthesia for six hours because they put my port in the same time. I guess I'm just being impatient. I've never been a sickly person, only took calcium and I'm 57 years old. Hkuester: I'm still sleeping on the couch. I tried the bed last night but it hurts to lay on my sides due to the TE. So it was back to the couch! I need that side \"wall\" of the couch. Maybe that would help you",
