I have a ton of external and internal itching, which I hope is a sign of healing? Also I noticed yesterday a pink ring around the nipple. It looks inflammed. However, there is no swelling, no pus and i have no fever. Which are all signs of infection. Is pinkness around the incision normal? Thans Log in to post a reply",
