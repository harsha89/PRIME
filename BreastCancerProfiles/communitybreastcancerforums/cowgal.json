It still bothers me a little but it got pretty bad this past weekend when I needed to keep both of my arms extended straight out while holding an object extended fully from my body in tandem with someone else. The strain it put on my shoulder was bad enough that I was unable to raise my arm in certain positions and had to bend at my waist for a couple of days to wash my hair. It is doing better now but made me realize that I need to do something to strengthen my shoulders, which obviously can be an issue on how to do with lymphedema. I have seen the infomercial for BodyGym and wondered if anyone was using it and if it might be a good solution to help me build up some strength for that shoulder as well as other supporting muscles. If you are not familiar with it, it is basically using a resistance band to do a wide range of exercises and also resistance can easily be adjusted. Any thoughts on if this would be a good idea?
