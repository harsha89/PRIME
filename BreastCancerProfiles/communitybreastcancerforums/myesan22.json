I'm doing TCH for 6 cycles then Herceptin (the H) for the remainder of a year. My side effects have been nausea and vomiting (even on meds) but I'm prone to that. I will more than likely ask for a different medication. Also had the vomiting after surgeries which was caused by the anesthesia. I bought those motion sickness bands so we'll see how it goes with the next treatment. Other side effects are tiredness and feeling off balaance or dizzy. I'm trying to think of them as similar to pregnancy as others refer to them but I didn't have any of this with my pregnancy (lol). Not looking forward to weight gain from the steroids but we do what we must. I'm thinking I will probably do a lot of scarves when my hair comes out...not much of a wig person at least not during the warm/hot weather but might try one for the winter. What the heck, if you can't try new things during chemo when?! I wish everyone good luck with their treatment and try to stay positive! I received some good advice from the chemotherapy educator prior to starting chemo. For side effect of peripheral edema use vitamin B6 (100 mg). Keep a bottle of salt water at your desk and rinse, rinse, rinse throghout the day to help avoid mouth sores. Use tea tree oil to help avoid fingernail and toenail issues. DRINK, DRINK, DRINK tons of fluids. As always, check with your physician before using any medication to avoid potential interactions. Take care, Ladies!",

I just finished chemo and can't say it was a breeze but it wasn't as bad as I thought. You will get through it! I'm waiting for radiation now and not looking forward to doing that everyday but can't wait to just have to take Herceptin every 3 weeks. Keep your positive attitude and know that you will get through This!",
