I had a lump for a while that took me a while to get checked out, but when I finally did, we found more lumps. I had a biopsy, where we discovered it was ADH and an excisional biopsy to remove 3 precancerous lumps. It has left me with many cosmetic issues, like my right breast is dimpled and flat on the bottom and a lot smaller than the other. My left breast only dimples when I lay on my side. I am currently waiting on the results of my genetic test. Its really hard to find answers online because no one has ADH at the age of 21 that I have found. I have a family history with cancer in multi-generations, prostate, uterine, and breast. I do not want to take tamoxofin especially because of my age. When I ask about a BDM, everyone looks at me like I'm crazy, but i feel like being on surveillance would be waiting for cancer. I should find out within the next week and a half the results of my genetic test. The counselor said she would not be shocked if it came back positive. Basically, has anyone else been diagnosed with ADH this young? How did your treatment go?",
