I had a mastectomy on July 15th, when they also removed three lymph nodes. As of the pathology report dated July 23rd one of the axillary sentinel lymph nodes tested positive for micrometastic tumor (four foci seen). Now I am scheduled for another surgery where the surgeon will \"inser port catheter with fluoroscopy and right axillary lymph npde dissection with nerve block for pain control\" She will insert a prolonged central venous access device into a major vein. The alternative is not Operating and using venous access in the arm. I am very scared of this surgery because of the sensitivity and importance of the lymph nodes, thus increasing the pain and healing, and the potential of risks, and possible long term affects. I could wait to meet with the oncology dr. and have more tests to see if cancer can be detected elsewhere yet, and just start chemo. Or should I just get the surgery, even though there may be no more cancer in any other lymph nodes. I would appreciate any advice.
