    "Content": "Cheech76 wrote: I had a lumpectomy last week for what the breast specialist felt was likely a radial scar. Unfortunately she doesn't operate at hospitals on my insurance so I went to a general surgeon. Surgery didn't quite go as planned. The wire fell out and then the clip wasn't in the specimen he sent to pathology so he went back in, removed another specimen but the clip still wasn't there. The good news? Pathology came back as radial scar/CSL. The bad news? He didn't remove the entire area. Unfortunately since he did 2 lumpectomies, it changed the shape of my already small breasts. I'm concerned it'll look worse if I have the rest of the area removed. However, the breast specialist said the can be pre-malignant and that's why she recommended excision. I don't want anything left that could cause cancer in the future. Has this ever happened to anyone else?? General surgeon advised against removing the remain area. Log in to post a reply",
