I had the exact same reaction to it as you did.  I did Taxotere first and didnt have nausea but FEC was a different story. With FEC I was on 3 anti-nausea drugs for my first round  and still had to go in to get re-hydrated.  But for the 2nd round the nurses and I talked quite a bit and changed my strategy.  I ended up taking fewer types of drugs but more frequently which made all the difference, ",
