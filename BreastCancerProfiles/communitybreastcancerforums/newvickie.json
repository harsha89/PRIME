I have a compression sleeve that goes from my wrist to my shoulder that I wear whenever I do any heavy housework. Anyway...I overdid it a bit at work yesterday...wore my sleeve all night and woke up this morning with a horribly swollen hand!!! Totally freaked out...tingly and numb. The swelling is now gone (good thing...right?)but my elbow and shoulder are both feeling \"sore\"...tender to the touch. Not red or swollen just achey and sore. Should I put the sleeve back on? Elevate my arm...massage (I know you have to be trained or you an make matters worse but is there anything I can do). I know I need to see the doctor and have an appointment next Wednesday with my breast surgeon and can get a referall then...just looking for any advice you can give me. I don't know how you ladies do it! Hugs and many many thanks Vickie Log in to post a reply",

Gone From My Sight I am standing upon the seashore.  A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean.  She is an object of beauty and strength.  I stand and watch her until at length she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come mingle with each other. Then someone at my side says: \"There, she is gone.\" \"Gone where?\" Gone from my sight. That is all.  She is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and she is just as able to bear her load of living freight to her destined port. Her diminished size is in me, not in her.  And just at the moment when someone at my side says \"There she is gone!\"  there are other eyes watching her coming, and other voices ready to take up the glad shout: \"Her she comes!\" and that is dying. Anonymous  I would like to imagine all the sister before her...waiting there and taking up the glad shout...I want her back...it is not to be.  She was like a thread...binding us all together. ",
