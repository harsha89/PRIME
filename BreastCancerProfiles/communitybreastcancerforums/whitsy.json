      "Content": "whitsy wrote: Hi all. A few weeks ago, I got a cold which eventually turned into a massive sinus infection that not only blocked my nose but also my ear. I have been on antibiotics for almost 1 week now and am still not feeling better. Worse, my ear is still blocked. The infection and blocked ear are on the same side as my BC. During my mastectomy I had 25 nodes removed too (all negative). Could my problems now be due to having limited lymph nodes. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Janice Log in to post a reply",
