Yes, even though I was not heavy, I lost weight and it greatly helped my LE. I had been 125 lbs and I went down to about 113 lbs (5'5\" height). My LE is so much better at the lower weight! My LE is highly influenced by what, and how much, I eat. My LE therapist told me to restrict my diet: low sodium (salt), low calorie, low fat, high fiber, no caffeine (that means no chocolate - ugh!), no alcohol. I generally strictly stick to the recommended diet and noticed my LE is much better when I do. Yes, hotter, more humid weather definitely makes my LE worse, so I try to stay cool. I was diagnosed with LE over a year ago. My LE is widespread: bilateral, truncal, plus swelling in the legs and feet (I had seven surgeries). I used to have to wear compression garments on arms, hands, trunk, plus waist down. Now, as my LE therapist predicted, my LE is much improved. I wear the compression vest as needed. I wear my right sleeve and glove only when I do my LE arm exercises. I wear my left sleeve a bit more, but usually go sleeveless. So, most of the time I am compression garment free. Best wishes for good health!",

Because my body build is on the small side of normal, most of my LLL treatments were done with the LLL on the low setting, instead of high, which I think was helpful for me. Given the big effect that the low setting had on me, I think that the high setting would have been too much for my body, but each person's body is different.

My swelling greatly improved with manual lymph drainage massage, carefully controlled diet, exercise and some changes in lifestyle (for example, minimizing repetitive motions, avoiding heat).

I am writing this in the hope that reading what helped me might in turn aid others in developing their own plan to help themselves. I am not a medical professional. I don't know if the things that help me will help you, but I encourage you to try to understand what aggravates or helps your LE and set your own course of action. Here is what helped me: 1. daily Manual Lymph Drainage 2. daily arm LE exercises 3. daily walk (not in the heat, if it is hot I walk in an air conditioned mall or large store - about 1 mile) 4. lost weight - Even though I was not heavy (5 ft. 5 inches and weighed 125 lbs), I lost ten pounds. Bringing my weight to 115 lbs helped my LE. 5. diet - no salt, low sodium, high fiber, low fat, low calorie, no alcohol, no caffeine (which means no coffee or chocolate - ugh!), limited meat. Foods that help my LE include Brazil nuts (1 per day for the selenium), pineapple, red grapefruit, egg whites, salmon. My LE therapist told me that, in addition to one's weight, what one eats (and doesn't eat) is quite important. I was told that one patient, who was not making progress in reducing her arm swelling despite treatment, was instructed to write down everything she eats each day. The list was then critiqued, using the guidelines I mentioned above (no salt, low fat, no alcohol, etc.). The patient changed her diet, and with no change in treatment, her arm swelling reduced. LE seems to be different for different people, but my swelling (and the discomfort LE can cause) is highly influenced by what and how much I eat. I seem to do better eating small meals instead of large meals. I feel best mostly eating vegetables, fruits, low and non-fat dairy, fish, and some whole grains, with a very limited amount of (relatively lean) meat. 6. 8 glasses of water each day 7. Bellisse compression vest daily until my truncal swelling diminished. Now I rarely use the Bellisse (only when I notice the beginnings of truncal swelling again). 8. Avoided or very limited anything that was bad for my LE, for example repetitive arm movements, lifting heavy things. 9. Avoid heat and hot things. No hot showers, just lukewarm or cool. Let my food cool a bit before I eat it. Wear layered cotton clothing, so as not to overheat. Eat frozen fruit to cool off in the summer (frozen grapes and pineapple are delicious). 10. Due to the LE, I was repeatedly getting infections on my fingertips, so I am very careful what I touch and try not to touch dirty things. For example, I buy already cleaned vegetables and fruit. I use disposable gloves more. 11. I use Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair Lotion or Eucerin Daily Replenishing Lotion on my skin when it is dry, especially my fingertips. 12. Rebounding was a huge help and particularly was great in stopping the pain. I had read that it is important to use a quality rebounder, so I did some research on the internet and (after obtaining my doctor's approval) bought a half fold Cellerciser rebounder with balance bar. I was told to start off slowly - one minute a day doing the \"health bounce\" (feet don't leave the mat) - then slowly work up to more time. After about a month of rebounding, I went to about 3 minutes, five times per day. 13. Dry myself with towels in the direction I want the lymph to flow. 14. Pay attention to what helps or hurts my LE and adapt my actions accordingly. 15. Wore compression sleeves and gloves. Now I usually only need my sleeves and gloves when doing my arm exercises, so am currently free of compression garments most of the day. 16. Five to ten deep \"belly\" breaths, several times throughout the day - taught to me by my LE therapist. 17. Low level laser treatments (LTU-904 cold therapeutic laser). The low level laser has made a huge positive difference in my life. Since beginning the laser treatments, I have significantly less discomfort from the LE, I virtually stopped getting infections in my finger tips (which had been a repeated problem), and a relatively hard part in my forearm is getting softer. The low level laser has definitely improved my quality of life. I am incredibly more comfortable with my pain diminished. 18. Tried to maintain an upbeat, positive attitude. My husband told me everyday that I would get better and that was quite encouraging. After 15 months of fighting LE, almost all of my swelling is gone. The pain is gone, but I still have some discomfort. I want to fully recover and will keep up my efforts. I hope that you overcome your LE and wish you the best of luck!",

An experienced, well trained LE therapist can be a huge help: teaching you Manual Lymph Drainage massage, wrapping, fitting you for compression garments, teaching you about diet (my LE therapist recommended low fat, low sodium, no caffeine, no alcohol, high fiber), and more. In the meantime, it is good to avoid heat and hot water, including no hot baths or showers, as heat can increase the swelling. Also, my doctor recommends immaculate hygiene (particularly the fingers), in order to help avoid infections, as LE patients can easily get infections that can spread fast. I have learned much from reading this board and hope that you do, too. I hope that you find a good LE therapist and that your swelling goes down soon!",
