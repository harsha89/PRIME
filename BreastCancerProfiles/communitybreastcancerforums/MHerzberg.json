While I was getting this mam, the xray tech took the first set of photos and told me to stay there so she could check with radiologist. She came back and said that he wanted magnified of my left breast in a certain area. So we took those while I was there. All the tech said was he seen some abnormalities and wanted better pics. So 2 days to by and my ObGyn calls and aays that they have sent over orders to the hospital for me to get a biopsy of my left breast as soon as possible, \"as the radiologist seen several clusters of micro calcifications\" and said that he needed me to schedule a followup with him to discuss the tests. I'm really beginning to worry. I couldnt schedule it Friday as the scheduling dept was closed, so I have to call tomorrow. Is this normal? Is there anything that I should be worried about? Also, when I go back to the doctor what questions should I ask - for either outcome?

She said because of the size, less than 1cm, just shows up in microcalcifications. They were clustered odd, so they biopsied them. She said that I didn't need HER2 therapy before, as it is so small, but will definitely need after, because I am HER2+. They both said it is going to depend on pathology says after lumpectomy as to if I need chemo. I will do whatever is needed to kick this thing in the @$! Thanks for the well wishes.",
