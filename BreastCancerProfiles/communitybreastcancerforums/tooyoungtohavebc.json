I tried a few pills some nights to help but they always make me tired the next day and I am pretty much an anti pill person anyway. But last night I went to bed at 11 and woke up about 7:30 and was shocked when I looked at the clock. Maybe I finally turned a corner!! I am one of those people who has to get 8 hours or it gets ugly:) so this sleep struggle has been a big deal for me. Crossing my fingers for more of these!

I admire the women here who continue to endure chemo after chemo and who are on chemo with no end in sight. You are champs! I have done 4 types so far and all have worked for me in shrinking the tumors, but I do think I will reach a saturation point because after each chemo cancer started growing again. Keep in mind I don't have kids, and I did watch my mother die a slow death from cancer when I was very young. Am I alone in feeling like this? When is enough, enough? Anyway here is the email to my friend.... \"Want to clarify about what I started to tell you. It's not that I don't have anything to live for and thus want to stop long term chemo if that is what I will face, it is more a matter of, is this really living, is this how I want to live for whatever years I have left. And I don't.   Not being able to leave the house cuz I am too tired for days at a time...is not living. Not being able to vacation because of how I feel...not living. Even having visitors come is difficult because it's exhausting. So to me there is being alive and then there is living. I dont want to stay alive just because. I know people luv me and I luv many, including you. I wish that were enough to make me want to suffer through life long chemo, but it isn't. I know I will see my friends and loved ones again somewhere. So that part doesn't scare me. I do not want to just breathe to exist. I want to experience life and to me that means more than just being housebound and sick.   Anyway I am not at the point where I have to make this decision yet, but I have thought about it. I have my last chemo tomorrow and will get a break after that. But if this crap keeps progressing, I am just not sure I will continue to douse my body with toxins to give myself a few more months of breathing. These are the choices some of us have to make in our life and let me tell you, watching my mother die slowly of cancer def has played a part in what I am willing to do.\" Dx 6/2005, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, 1/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

So she brings in this woman who tells me the steroids are not the cause of my disrupted sleep and that with the dosage I have the steroid should be out of my system within 24 hours. I think that is a load of crap because I have had this steroid before and know how I respond. So I started crying and told her to leave and that she was not being helpful. I also told her that I researched Ixempra online and there were some women who were not getting decadron or steroids with the infusion. So she left. Well she came back a few hours later and told me she did some research and that I was right. Ixempra could be given without steroids, so for my next infusion I could skip it!
