      "Content": "Nov 10, 2009 03:30AM - edited Nov 10, 2009 03:35AM by Purpleladi Would you believe none of these doctors are on my insurance? I can't believe how difficult this is finding a doctor. I have literally spent 3 hours calling offices and looking online for a breast surgeon. For now, I'm trying to stay in NJ. The only doctors that were listed were Huston, Addis and O'Shea (all in the same office), but Huston is out on medical leave and appointments for the other 2 doctors are not until March. Is it normal to have to wait that long? They have a new doctor there named Tameka White (sp?) and I can get an appt for January, but I can't find any info on her.  Has anyone heard of her?",
