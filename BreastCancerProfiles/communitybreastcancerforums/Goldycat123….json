Thy took out a few nodes and took out about the size of an apple from my left breast . It wasn't a huge lump, it was various ducts that contained cancer cells. I'm still Stge 0 dcis I believe unless pathology says there's more going on or spread . Is it normal to feel a buzzing vibrating feeling on the incision ?

Last week I had genetic testing ( blood test ) . So you'll most likely have similar appointments . So sorry for your news but it sounds very similar to my situation so you're not alone !",

This coming Tuesday I have my first consultation appt with the Oncologist about radiation treatments. I've been wondering how it will make me feel . I'm thankful to have this website to look at so I don't feel alone in all of this. One good thing for me is so far I don't have to have chemo . Just radiation. And a lumpectomy . So I guess I'm very fortunate . It's still scary though ......",
