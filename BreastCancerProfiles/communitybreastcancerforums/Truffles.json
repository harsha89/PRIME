I was originally stage IIa and node negative in 2010 but now have a recurrence in a node so am upstaged to IIIa. I've been getting so much amazing info and help from the April, May and June boards so hopefully we'll have a group of our own to go through this with!  ",

I just got back from vacation and will be starting AC x 4 tomorrow, with T on deck after that. We decided that if people get baby-moons before a baby comes, we'd take a chemo-moon to enjoy the last week before it starts  I highly recommend it. Based on the wonderful advice on these boards, the house is stocked with lots of nonacidic sports drinks, meds (constipation/diarrhea, Claritin, Advil, plus rx from MO), supplements for Taxol (glutamine and L-carnitine), kleenex, wet wipes, mouthwash, soft toothbrushes and toothbrush covers, and comfy clothes. Already had my dental checkup and cleaning two weeks ago, and Neulasta is already in the fridge to self-administer after chemo. I have an echo tomorrow morning first thing, followed by an appointment to order a wig from the hospital store. Will then come home and pack a chemo kit for my afternoon onco appointment and first infusion. So far I'm planning to bring Ipad, book, blanket, travel pillow, drinks, and handwarmers to help my veins pop out since I don't have a port. I'll let you all know if there are other things I wished I had brought! Wishing a good night's sleep and the best possible course of chemo to all... reading your posts makes me feel like I can face this tomorrow.",

Maybe we can join the June group if nobody else comes! I'll be having radiation after the ACT is over so not until the winter. My infusions will be on Wednesdays too, except for the first which is a Monday because of the July 4 holiday. Since it's just 8 total, I won't be getting a port and we're hoping to use just veins. Fingers crossed that it works!! Sorry you have to travel so far for your appts, I'm lucky that I work at the hospital where I'm being treated so it's only 10min away by car or a 30min walk if I feel well. How little are your little ones? I'm starting ovarian suppression soon so sadly no little ones for me for quite a while... hopefully someday! ",

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2012 05:02PM Truffles wrote: Good morning everyone! I'm now on day 5 after my first adriamycin/cytoxan so thought I'd check in. The day of the infusion I drank massive amounts of fluid and kept my hand in a warm sock along with a heatpack to keep my veins plump, and the IV stick went well (although in the wrist, very achy spot). I'm hoping to get through this without a central line (port or PICC) so I'll keep you posted how that goes. There was an initial delay to send blood counts and liver tests (all came back fine). They started with two pills of Zofran, an infusion of a half liter saline followed by the IV Emend - by that point my arm was freezing from all the cold fluid so we wrapped it in warm blankets which helped a lot. Then the gowned gloved nurse did the adriamycin push directly from syringes into my IV - my goodness that stuff is RED. And FREAKY looking, especially with the nurse in biohazard apparel. She watched like a hawk to make sure my veins were handling it well. She, my friend, and my husband became a constant chorus of \"does it feel alright? no burning? no pain? how you doing? no burning?\" Thanks guys, but I'd be the first to shout if it felt wrong!! One small collateral vein high in my forearm turned red, so she stopped the push and called over the nurse specialist to check it out. They flushed it with saline and since the main vein they were using was unaffected, they kept going and finished the push fine. After that they hung the cytoxan which took an hour - during this I got a very odd full heavy feeling in my nose and mild headache. My husband gave me a couple Advil and the headache wore off quickly after the infusion ended. All in all this took 4 hours, but the bloodwork added an hour. In the future I'll be getting bloodwork before I see the MO before infusion, so it should be 3 hours. The last indignity of the day was getting my first Lupron shot in my left buttock - jumped a little at the stick but wasn't sore afterward. The first night I felt pretty crappy - like sudden onset of flu and extreme fatigue. I took a compazine to try to \"get ahead\" of the nausea but this was a big mistake - compazine and I do not get along. I got extreme vertigo as though the room was swaying side to side on a ship. Didn't sleep well that first night since had to go to the bathroom literally 7 times with all the fluids to flush out the cytoxan! Day 2 I actually felt fine, very little appetite but only a minimal buzz of background nausea. The evening of Day 2 I took a Claritin and gave myself the Neulasta shot in my belly, which stung quite a bit more than I'd expected! I may not have given it enough time to come up to room temp, which I'll definitely do next time. Day 3 was the pits. The bone and muscle pain from Neulasta combined with nausea from the Emend fully wearing off left me on the couch all day. I managed to take a 30 minute slow walk but otherwise was down for the count. Zofran did help somewhat, and Ativan helped me sleep well that night. Day 4 and 5 have been MUCH better!! Very minimal nausea, helped quite a bit by Zofran. I was also having heartburn (which I've never had in my life) but took a generic prilosec last night and feeling well this morning. About to go for a long walk and feeling good! The small vein that turned red now looks brownish, but the main vein they used in the wrist is fine without any lumps or redness (they told me to watch out for phlebitis). No mouth sores yet but I'm on the lookout! Just wanted to share my first A/C experience for those of you facing it soon! Hugs to all, we can get through this",

      "Content": "Truffles wrote: Hi everyone - I've been reading through some of the wonderful and so helpful threads on these boards, and wanted to draw on your collective wisdom to help me figure this out! I have the option of unpaid leave through chemo (dd AC x 4 and T x 4 starting in July) followed by radiation and still maintaining my health insurance. My husband and I don't have kids yet and are able to live for a year on his salary. The major money consideration is postponing my future income by a year, which is much higher than what I make now. Otherwise we own our home and live modestly, so should be okay on his salary for a year. It has to be a whole year because of the training program I'm in - can't just do a few months. In terms of my job, I'm in medical training and need to be mentally present and completely \"on\" in a high stress hospital environment 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. I am primarily at a computer but rarely need to operate a large machine. The most relevant thing is I *cannot* plan to be out of work at all - meaning no buffer day to take off if I am not feeling well, no leaving early, no naps at work etc. If I am going to work, I need to be able to work every day without a break, except a half day off every other week for infusions. There is no wiggle room in this! In terms of my personality, I'm the opposite of Type A - I do fine with quiet or solitary time and don't really get bored or antsy if I have books, movies, and time to see family/friends. I don't define myself by my work, although I enjoy it, and I don't think I'd have issues around \"dwelling\" too much on cancer. I've never had more than a couple weeks off though, so this is uncharted territory! I know everyone on here has made different choices that are based on their own experiences and situations, and I would love to hear what you think! If you didn't have to work during chemo and rads, would you still? For those of you that took time off, how did you feel? Would any of you in either situation change your decisions looking back? Thanks all   Dx IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIA, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I would have loved to start chemo first and then make a decision, but our schedule runs on a July 1 to July 1 basis so I have to decide before I start whether I'm in for the year or out. I'm really prone to nausea at other times - barfed all day and night after mastectomy, get easily nauseated in the car etc, so I'm worried about that during chemo. I'm generally an active person (walk an hour a day, not overweight but eat waaaaayyy too many kettle chips...) so maybe that will help me. It's just hard to have to choose between work full steam like nothing is going on or don't work at all for a year! I had been feeling kind of cruddy about being a year behind in my training but your responses are helping me see that in a way it's a gift that I have the choice of taking time off or not. Lot of thinking to do this week... and lot of BCO thread reading!",

FYI a radiologist is a doctor with the same amount of training as a surgeon (6 years training after 4 years of medical school if they have a breast imaging fellowship). If a radiologist feels strongly it looked malignant, I totally agree that you should have it out and get a final answer! The medical system is not your problem - your own health and wellbeing are, and you did just the right thing by standing up for yourself! Fibroadenomas can grow and change, but Phyllodes tumors can look just like FAs or an FA can rarely have a part that is malignant. I still think most likely it will be benign, but the risk of leaving it alone makes no sense after that recommendation and you are doing the right thing!! Sending you good vibes and good wishes for a benign result!",
