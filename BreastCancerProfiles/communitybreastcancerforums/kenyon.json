My breast surgeon initially counselled me about post-surgical treatment options and brought up the prospect of my being a good candidate for brachytherapy radiation via Mammosite catheter. I consulted with a radiation oncologist pre-surgery who presented me with a very thorough overview of both whole breast radiation and Partial breast irradiation (PBI) including risks and efficacy. I elected to do PBI and have not regretted this. I underwent a lumpectomy on 7/18/16 with placement of a placeholder for the Mammosite catherter pending return of final surgical tissue pathology results. I returned to out-patient surgery on 7/20/16 for exchange of the placeholder with the Mammosite catheter. The day following placement of the Mammosite catheter I had an appointment with radiation oncology for my simulation. This was a Friday, and I began my 10 treatments that following Monday, July 25th. Two treatments per day for 5 days, and I was done treatment on Friday, July 29th. I have no regrets with my choice of treatment. I experienced only mild pain at the catheter insertion site over the weekend before starting treatment, but this totally subsided by the first day of my treatment. By the 5th and last day the area over the Mammosite bulb was beginning to turn a bit red, and I did experience mild burning with skin peeling in that area of my breast that completely cleared over the period of 1-2 months. I am approximately 6 months out from treatment and experience no side effects, swelling or discomfort. The whole process was short, not at all unpleasant, and I would choose this route again if necessary and possible. As noted above, there are easy ways around the \"no showers\" while the catheter is in place. I found tub baths to be a reasonable compromise as long as I took care to not get my upper quarter wet. Best wishes for a speedy recovery!",

I was recently referred for stereotactic bx due to mricrocalc in left breast and made the decision to transfer my care to a well respected cancer center that has an affiliation with MGH. It fell upon me to direct my own transfer of care - obtaining films and reports, calling the imaging center that would be doing the bx to find out protocol to schedule the bx, calling the BS of my choice for a consultation. Once I saw the BS who made the referral of bx, I felt that after several days I should have received notice of my scheduled date for the bx. I took it upon myself to call the BS who advised me to call the imaging center to find out status of scheduling. I discovered that the x-ray dept. that had done the diagnostic mammo had failed to provide a complete set of films, therefore, the delay in scheduling. My point in relating this to you is that, if you feel things are not moving fast enough you will find that you will receive status updates if you call. I would call the cancer center to which you are being referred to ensure that they have a complete set of records from the referring physician and get reassurance that you will be contacted soon with an appointment. My bx was positive for presumed DCIS, and my BS discussed with me the next steps to take. I feel comfortable with the further diagnostics he has recommended and do not want to rush into a treatment protocol until we know as much as possible through further diagnostics. I think approaching it this way offers the best possible outcome. Receiving a dx of BC is a frightening and confusing experience. We are all supporting you and wish you the best.",
