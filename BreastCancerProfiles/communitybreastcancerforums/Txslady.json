Anyway I was then referred to a breast surgeon I waited and waited and finally a biopsy was done. Two weeks later she had me come in and she told me I have stage 1 breast cancer. Since then I was told to go get and MRI because no surgery until this is done and I waited and waited because I had to come up with $300.00 for the day of the MRI.I have medicare advantage and certaintly don't mind paying but I didn't have it for that day. So she cancelled it. I waited and waited until I had the money then I paid them and got the MRI. That was 9 days ago and my breast surgeon still hasn't recieved it. Is it because I don't have big money that they don't care? Is the cancer spreading to my lymph nodes. So discouraged .",
