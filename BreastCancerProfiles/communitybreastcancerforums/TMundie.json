    "Content": "Feb 19, 2016 07:25PM - edited Feb 19, 2016 07:26PM by TMundie I had my appointment yesterday for my ultrasound. The area of concern was not even the adenosis area from last year. It was a complex cyst that has jagged edges that looks concerning. I was told it is significantly bigger than before, thing is I never knew it was there previously. I was never informed. I have an appointment but not until March 11, for a needle aspiration with a biopsy. Radiologist said we cannot wait 6 months for re evaluation it is getting bigger. How concerning is this? Waiting 3 weeks seems like torture. BS is going on vacation.  ",
