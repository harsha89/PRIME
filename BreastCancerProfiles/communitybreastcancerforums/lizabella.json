To very specifically answer your question- yes, it can have irregular edges and be b9.  I can't speak to the comfort of an MRI biopsy.  I had mine done by ultrasound and it wasn't painful.  The most uncomfortable part was having my arm over my head.  Recovery has been great.  I'm only one day out and I certainly wouldn't poke my breast with a stick, but it doesn't hurt or ache or stick.  The most painful part was when my breast was waking up after the procedure.  It would kind of twinge and let me know that it was there.  It wasn't exactly painful, just a different sensation. Next step is waiting for results.  For me, stressing about the test has been more difficult than waiting for results.  I should have results sometime tomorrow.  Today is a much better day than yesterday.  Long story short, the test itself doesn't suck. (I can't imagine MRI is all that different than the ultrasound version)  The people doing them know what they are doing and your conmort is important to them.  Keep busy.  Avoid googeling things to death.  Know that we are all here rooting for you.",
