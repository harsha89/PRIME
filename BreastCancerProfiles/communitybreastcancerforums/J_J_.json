I was given a pamphlet ( one of many, even printers can profit from this!) that said I would feel nothing at all. I felt pangs almost right away, across my chest and later under the treated breast. I have a high pain threshhold, so when I asked about it, was told that it is normal...so, wasted pamphlet?? I also didn't cream my back until it was too late, as I had no idea I needed to until the bumps and itchiness began. I surely do \"feel\" burned right now, 25/30, and having trouble sleeping with this pain I am not supposed to have.  That comment because I saw my rad onc for the first time since I started Rads and you know what he said when told the skin breakdown was so painful I can't sleep?...Oh, I have seen a whole lot worse than you! I think it actually looks worse than it feels...!!! What ???? I said, no, it hurts even worse than it looks!  The crew in radiology are fantastic people though, so they keep me cheery.... but I wish total care could be staffed with some who have been through the process, not just treating it...I am pretty sure there would be more accuracy of info.   J_J_",

The rads actually not been all that difficult, just hard to get some information....Most pain just at night when things pull and stretch & I want to SLEEP!!! Also don't like someone else, especially a doctor who is supposed to be my ADVOCATE, telling me how little pain I am actually having. Implies it is all in my head, the rotter.... I am using tons of cream, just have really sensitive skin. I find Aloe, the real thing from the plant is very soothing, then cream on after, but need need to get up in the night and do it often this last week or so   ...But you are still peeling after all this time?...ugh...Better than some other side effects though, I suppose... Is there not a notification on this board, RMlulu? I looked in and saw your answer , but had no email it was here... J_J_",

They don't want to discourage you from using the treatment they've used for over a 100 years...now they speak of that as being proven, but perhaps this makes it quite simply....archaic.  But am done now! well, with the rads anyway...Thanks all, for the cheers and cheer me uppers.. I was given mepalex dressings, then the padded ones and have not had the excrutiating pain since ( Get a large sheet and cut to size with sterilized scissors...Keep the pkg. on while cutting for the clear sheets )...totally recommend this for the nip, as that is where they tend to stick best, and where I needed it the most...Peeling there for the second time now, but not bleeding this time.  I think I started burning & having small blisters rather early. Aloe directly from the plant worked for me, but we are all so different it seems?  I have sensitive skin and was not allergic to this product, but it doesn't stick to just any skin, especially the harder skin resulting from the rad treatment, so couldn't use tape elsewhere as I am allergic to several glues since my surgery... Hugs back...J_J_ Note to mepalex should you read this!!!...please lower your prices, but not the quality on these dressings and I am sure you will get more customers. The expense detours people away...",

Am not using it for larger breakdown areas at this final stage though....Mepital pads are wonderful if you can get some. Sticky but non glue, and a spongy dry surface.  Doesn't always stay put on armpit or sweaty areas, though *SIGH* which is almost everywhere on me, but a lose bra can help hold in place!  J_J_",

      "Content": "Sep 20, 2013 06:11PM - edited Sep 25, 2013 03:03PM by J_J_ Have just completed 30 ( 25/5 boosts) and had a bad time 2 weeks ago with the nip* swollen to double size and looked like a huge red button. Rather mortifying, but the hardest part was no sleep for 3 nights from the pain, ( this was on a weekend so only one zap in that time) and it started to peel and bleed. Nurse gave me the thin transparent Mepitel after applying I used the usual aloe ( right from the plant) which goes through the holes so you don't have to remove the dressing and it helped right away, so I had a much better 4th day, then next day got Mepilex, the padded version, hubby calls them pasties...and they are fabulous...Don't bother getting it for areas on which they won't stick... I found the undearm and chest area rejected them...maybe because I was getting harder flesh there, not sure... or maybe was losing too much real skin to hold them in place Mind you I could have taped those on, but I got some new allergies to some suture tape and bandages since my surgery... I have sensitive skin and allergies, so didnt use any cream but Lubraderm then Glaxa-base the whole therapy, but wonder if it wouldn't have been wise to have told me to start using it a long time before rads as well? They didn't tell me my back would also burn and it is the place that itches the most. Funny that you should mention vinegar was recommended as I remembered when I was young I was told to put it on a sunburn...the acetic acid has numbing properties, I guess? Anyway, I used it first soaked on a per towel to soothe, then aloe directly from the plant, then Glaxal-base cream....and now put nothing where there is exposed peel, I keep the mepilex on that area...I hope if the manufacturers see we recommend it they will lower their prices, as I too was told it is \"expensive\"...hello....Maybe it would be more widely used if it wasn't. Cream-wise we seem to have different skin, many of us, so using what works best for our skin-type tolerance is best advice there... Thanks for the info re: late effects, they told me it could get worse but I guess they shy away from scaring us as not all get reactions, some don't even burn at all...I really didn't burn as badly as some do, though, I was told, but I did get some early blisters and issues perhaps due to sensitive skin. I have a very high pain threshold though, so I know it was bad for ME. Hope all are healing well....all the best J_J_",

I call it \"eau de hardware\"...and a lifesaver.  It doesn't heal, or help with pigment changes, but it surely soothes &  moisturizes. Use lots and wear a cotton tee you don't care about. Appeal to makers: please wellskin products, do not put up the price, make it more reasonable, as some ladies don't go for the more expensive suggestion. I bought a huge container at week 2 and now have a spare jug for the weeks ahead. I do have sensitive fair skin & some major allergies, and it worked up to now for me, but may not work for everyone. Ask for a little sample pack if they have one...  J_J_",
