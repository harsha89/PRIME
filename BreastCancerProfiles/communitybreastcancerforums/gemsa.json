Also, you can find a lot of information about young women and breast cancer at www.youngsurvival.org. There is a great group of women there as well that know what you are going through. I chose a bilateral mastectomy as well, because like you said, we have long lived ahead of us and don't want to have to deal with this again. It also helps with the symmetry. Good luck! Tina",

They tested my pituitary too, which ended up being normal. I had a breast lump too, which they said was a cyst. It ended up being cancer. You have a very strong family history - they should be taking you much more seriously. The can do a cytologic exam of the discharge to test for cancer cells. You should ask for more testing. Stick with it until they give you a definitive diagnosis for what is wrong. Good luck.",
