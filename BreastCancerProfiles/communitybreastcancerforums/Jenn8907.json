It doesn't hurt, and it's deep inside, like maybe an inch or less above my rib cage. It's in the lower left corner of my breast. I'm a little concerned because I've been reading about breast cancer tumor characteristics, and it has a few of those. It's not exactly round, and it feels like it has some grooves in it. It does move around a little, though. Does this sound like the real deal, or are there other things that can mimic a breast cancer tumor that closely? I know I need to get it checked.
