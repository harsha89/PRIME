My bc is in my left breast, very high and almost in my cleavage. Like chest bone area. Because of this location the BS actually made his incision lower on the breast and went up to get the tumor. So my scar would be below \"gown line\". And I'm glad he did, because it's going to be one hell of scar. It's about 5 nches long. I only had the drain for two days. Surgery was tues, drain came out thurs. and it wasn't that bad. I slept most of that time anyway. I had read that some people were back to feeling normal in like two days after a lumpectomy. Not sure where that bs came from, because I am still extremely sore. Not needing pain meds, just sore. And very very bruised still. It seems like new bruises appear every day. But it's probably all because of the way he had to go in and lift the skin, fill in the gap, rearrange stuff. But you will most definitely not be able to pick your child for at least a week, maybe longer. In my opinion.",

Celebrate all victories! ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™ 3bears, I have done that scrolling back, lose post thing. It sucks. Sorry I was the reason. Lol. I start March 3rd with Taxotere and Carboplatin. Four rounds every three weeks. With that will be Herceptin every three weeks for a full year. (Because I'm HER2). A few weeks after I finish with the TC I start radiation. 30 sessions. And also will start Tamoxifen then too. Pugsmama, I feel the same. I need to do absolutely everything I can now or my mind will never be at rest. If it comes back, I won't blame myself. We got this! My treatment plan totally screwed up our big vacation with our families. Boo. Tried to schedule around it, but no go. Oh well. Husband will just have to take my bald head to Hawaii when it's all done. üòÅ I need that cabana for real! Pyrrh, I think your right about the fact that it wasn't the size alone. He actually explained it very well in that my cancer may be gone from the lumpectomy, and my nodes are clear..but there may still be little ugly abnormal cancer cells floating around in my body that can start growing and cause cancer anywhere else. Being triple positive, there is a lot that can cause the cancer to grow (being premenopausal adds to it). But being triple positive, I have proven effective treatments I can do to stop it from come back. So that's what I'll do. üí™ And yay for not having to board the chemo train! üëç",

I too have been researching this and found this post with a lot of great info: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topics/839070?page=2#idx_36 but your list has it nicely gathered and presented. THANK YOU! (I hit submit before I saw your recent post. I LOVE the hair cut! it looks great on you!) I have also inquired on a free box of queasy pops. Sent them an email and they responded the same day saying \"the box is on it's way, wishing you all the best!). Excellent company! (email the company at info@preggiepop.com and tell them you're undergoing chemo for BC they will send you a free box) I found an amazing blog \"Breast Cancer? But Doctor...I hate pink!\" she lists out some free stuff for breast cancer patients. I ordered a free scarf from France Luxe. (might take a while to get here, but that's ok). http://www.butdoctorihatepink.com/2010/02/free-stuff.html Shelly, let us know how the chemo class goes! mine is scheduled for Feb 23 but I think I might bump it to next week. (and my echo is Monday) Docmama, thanks for the insight on the nails. (I had no idea about that one). BTW, have I mentioned that I love your profile name? One of my furbabies is named Doc. :) so technically, I too am a Docmama.  and my other little baby is Brody. :) ",
