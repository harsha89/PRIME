This morning at 9:15am I was back at the hospital having a biopsy on a mass on the other breast, which the dr said looks like it will come back b9!    She said she'd call me Thurs or Fri latest with the results. Meanwhile, I am not supposed to use -either- arm, so I'm limiting my typing today - lol - //only bright side is husband gets to do the chores.  ;-) So..... I'll let you all know what I hear on Thurs/Fri (I'm a little more scared for my shoulder and dodgy huge knot size lymph node on same size... I'm seeing gyno on the lymph-node and any other clinical but not biopsied findings from the report and have to see a neurologist about the shoulder -which looks really horrible by the way -eek) Log in to post a reply",
