I always make sure to tell all the surgeons about it: Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital, 211 N.Y. 125, 105 N.E. 92 (1914), was a decision issued by the New York Court of Appeals in 1914 which established principles of informed consent and respondeat superior in United States law. The plaintiff, Mary Schloendorff, was admitted to New York Hospital and consented to being examined under ether to determine if a diagnosed fibroid tumor was malignant, but withheld consent for removal of the tumor. The physician examined the tumor, found it malignant, and then disregarded Schloendorff's wishes and removed the tumor. The Court found that the operation to which the plaintiff did not consent constituted medical battery. Justice Benjamin Cardozo wrote in the Court's opinion: Schloendorff, however, had sued the hospital itself, not the physicians. For this reason, the Court found that a non-profit hospital could not be held liable for the actions of its employees-a principle that became known as the \"Schloendorff rule.\" The Court would later reject the \"Schloendorff rule\" in the 1957 decision of Bing v. Thunig.",

Had some problem with my vein blowing (I don't even know what that means except the nurse had to find another one). So now my hand is a bit bruised and I have the exhaustion/chemo fog settling in. But my onc said I was the poster child for getting through this (still working, taking care of my son and going to the gym most days). Of course I'm doing all of this at a really slow speed and don't feel particularly effective at any of it. But it does keep me from feeling sorry for myself which I would if I were home all the time. So the onc thinks based on this that I will breeze through the Taxol. I hope so.  ",

Some had many, many nodes, some were treated many years ago before they had the chemo I'm doing. But then, yes - I'm left with some group that seems like they were in my shoes a few years ago and got mets. I've talked to my onc about it and she keeps telling me my risk of recurrence is really, really low (I had 6mm in my sentinel node but all 14 axillaries were clear), ER/PR+ and HER2-.

No matter how great my friends and family, these women are living it every day. Ok. Now. May I bitch and moan? My last chemo is this Friday, 12/3. I am elated about that. What I am NOT elated about is the fact that I no longer have any eyebrows and my eyelashes are nearly gone too. I am a makeup wiz and am able to disguise it all with brow pencil, eyeliner, false eye lashes, etc. But for some reason this is truly depressing the hell out of me. I am very fair and blonde (well, when I had hair that is) and I feel like a ghost with no make up on. I've always dyed my brows because they were so light and now they are just gone....I truly look like a cancer patient and ironically at the end of the chemo. Ugh. And then I have a surgery scheduled for 12/20 to fix my implants. This will be the 9th surgery I've had in 2 years. Four related to cancer, and four related to reconstruction and infection. Then there's radiation that will start sometime in Feb and go on every day for 6 weeks. I AM SO SICK OF THIS.  I know I should be grateful bec. they are being sooooo agressive with me. When this is done I'll be on Tamoxifen and and aromitase inhibitor for the next 10 years. All good. But really. I just want to have a normal life. Thanks for letting me vent.  ",

The only human who I've let see me is my son because he asked and when I took my hat off he just giggled. And my hair is actually starting to grow back, but so slowly. I just keep going back in the bathroom to stare at my head several times a day. Am I the only one totally obsessed with this? I could have done the cold caps but two of the oncs I went to said, \"scalp mets\" and I freaked. But really, I just cannot stand it. And no, I don't want to rock it, henna tattoo it, be a proud bald woman with big earings or any of that shit. I had damn nice hair and I want it back.    ",

Wednesday was a week since my first treatment and I finally started to feel like I wasn't in a coma. Thursday and today were ok too, physically at least. But I finally went on Effexor because mentally I felt like pretty soon the only hospital I'd be in is a psychiatric one. Does anyone else feel....I dunno....paranoid? Totally sensitive if someone looks at you the wrong way? Crying over the craziest BS? Seriously, I hope these drugs work or they will be administering my last 3 Taxols in a mental ward somewhere...... ",

Just two more treatments to go (I won't even get into the surgery and rads yet). But have any of you had your eyes feel like they are constantly teary or watery or something? It's so damn annoying. I guess I shouldn't complain. I feel pretty good otherwise, but I must look pretty damn sad what with the eyes.....",
