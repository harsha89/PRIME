The genetic counselor called it \"a mutation of unknown significance\" due to lack of research. She told me she would call me if the gene is reclassified down the road as cancer causing. Also my onc, said he had never heard of it and did not make a big deal of it. My own research has shown me otherwise...My mother was tested and she was negative but they stopped there because there is no direct living relatives on my father's side. Of course now I'm worried about the risk for my children.",
