      "Content": "chercoco wrote: I am 32 years old and had a grandmother who had was diagnosed early (age 37) with bc. I just received pathology report that says that the final diagnosis is adenomyoepithelial adenosis extending to cauterized margins. I was told that it is a benign condition but can metastasize (sp?) and turn malignant. It has the ability to reocurr as well if margins are not clean. My doc has not had a case of this and says that it is a very rare condition and even more rare in someone 32 and that although it is b9 it needs to be taken care of. She actually suggested getting a second opinion of pathology and from another doc and her assistant said to contact the mayo clinic in jacksonville fl. When I called they seemed very interested and wanted me to get reports and slides to them right away and would get me seen a few days after they received all of the information. So I am in the process of getting everything to them.  I know it is not bc but I do want to find out more information about it. My doc said she needed to look up literature on it before she could answer any of my questions. Which kind of freaked me out a bit. I am trying to stay positive. It is a b9 condition. But then again things seem to feel hectic or something. In the notes of the report it suggests partial mastectomy to remove the rest of the cells.  Whatever kind of information or positive thoughts anyone can give would be much appreciated.

I am not looking for a diagnoses from someone or anything like that but more if someone could tell me where and what I am supposed to be looking at. I am hoping I can post them in a reply because again I don't want to make waves on this board or upset anyone.

      "Content": "chercoco wrote: I was given pathology report yesterday that told me I was diagnosed with adenomyoepithelial adenosisa b9 condition that has the ability to metastisize and become malignant. Spoke with bs who suggested a second opinion at the mayo clinic in fl. Then BS calls to say it may be adenomyoepithelioma which is malignant form. The entire thing is confusing me and her and obviously pathology who is sending samples to other places to review and giving me samples to take with me to the mayo clinic in FL.  The thing is I am not sure that the mayo clinic is the best and neither is my bs when I asked her. I already have everything in the process to go there and they seem VERY interested in seeing me. But I am wondering if there is someplace better and where the top hospital would be for something so rare but when I ask no one seems to know. It was as if the mayo clinic is great but not sure of there experience with what I have or how to go about finding an experienced place. I have search the net and asked and no one knows, so I am coming here for advice.  Am I doing the right thing? Do you have any suggestions? Can I get even a 3rd opinion? Is there someplace better I can go? Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "chercoco wrote: I was diagnosed with a radial scar and had excisional biopsy last Tuesday. I was told by bs not to consider it a b9 condition until final pathology from excisional biopsy although core needle biopsy said radial scar only. She said the lump was large and that there were only 5 samples taken during core biopsy that she felt waiting for results of excisional biopsy would be better. Well I was feeling great but now that it has been a week and I am still waiting all of my fears start to come back. I look into the eyes of my children and just knowing my future can change the moment the phone rings scares me. So I feel like I try to keep busy but jump whenever the phone rings. The bs told me 7-10 business days for results and it feels like torture. I keep telling myself I am 32 years old its just a radial scar. But then radial scar is so rare I wonder how I have a radial scar at 32. You see how I am driving myself crazy. It's as if my own mind is my worst enemy... I have read so many posts and really have learned so much from all of the ladies here. Thank you for letting me vent and all of your wise words. I don't know what I would be doing if I didn't come here to ease my mind. Log in to post a reply",
