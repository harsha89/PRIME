I woke up at 3am today and am waiting for DH to wake so I can go take a walk.  I think that might help get things moving... ugh.  I thought if they start moving too quickly I can call him to pick me up, lol.  Plus my two puppies would be very upset if I go for a walk without them since nobody else is awake here yet to keep them company. Football - sorry about your NYR.  They had a great run, that's for sure.  I love your recent picture.  When I was at the funeral on Thur, I had to get up and use the bathroom and my right food was acting up.  I don't know if it was from standing for 4 hours during the wake before sitting down.  But it was turning in with every step I took.  It corrected itself soon after.  Hopefully not neuropathy rearing it's head.  Today is my 50th bday and all I want to do is kick back, take a dump (hahaha), and putt putt around in my garden.  I have had no nausea as of yet after last Tuesday's round 4 which is a beautiful thing.  Thank you again girls, your words about our angel meant a lot.  Here is a picture of her.   ",

I am now convinced that days 3 and 4 are the worst.  And I am planning on feeling better tomorrow! I can sort of feel the gross chemo fog lifting this evening so hopefully I won't be disappointed tomorrow.  Sharon you are absolutely adorable.  And way to go on the chemo shrinking your sun damage.  Finally something good comes out of our misery, huh? I'm off to have a big bowl of unhealthy ice cream.  Chemo week anything goes.  Love you girls, hang in there!",

I can handle it.  One bad week out of each month is doable.  I think what made it so hard this first time was not knowing how much worse it would get.  And I was worried about the Neulasta kicking in, which I never did get a side effect from.  It might be because I coincidentally started my Zyrtec last week for seasonal allergies - I don't know.  I am just grateful. The chemo is definitely the worst part of this nightmare ride.  I haven't even thought about my breast and the scars, hard tissue and disfiguration since the chemo was pumped into me.  We'll get through it though ladies.  Together.",

Golfin - Don't go out in the sun without strong protection! My MO didn't even tell me this until my husband inquired and then MO said, \"Oh yes! You are very photosensitive on chemotherapy!\" Thanks Hubby.  These doctors, lol. Question for all - do you see your MO at your infusions? I haven't seen mine since the consultation and I've had three treatments already... Oh, and Cold?

You can always use them later for fat days or yard work, whatever.  It feels good to wear something you're not bulging out of.  It was either that or steal my hubby's basketball shorts (which my daughter has beat me to).

Today I'm going to pretend I'm well.  I'm still feeling round 5 but I'm about 75% better.  Going to hang out with my mom and have lunch by her pool.  First summer thing I've done yet.  Have a great day, girls! xo",

I do not have a cough, however I am a bit scratchy at times.  Perhaps trying Zyrtec or Claritan might offer some relief.  I do take that for seasonal allergies anyway, and my hubby was instructed to take it when he had a cold/cough.  Lena lou - I joined the March page just to keep tabs on what I could expect as I went through my April treatments.  This April thread will be a great resource for you, and everyone here is awesome! Welcome! Timbuktu - I am so sorry to hear about the contradictory BS you're dealing with.  I wonder if maybe two of these doctors can conference and come up with an agreeable plan for you? Maybe the two you're most comfortable with? Just a thought... Day two after treatment and hanging in there.  Made it in to work, although awake since 3:15am, so it will probably be an early dismiss for me.  In case my dark place gets too dark to post from, want to wish all you beautiful women a very happy fourth of july weekend! I for one will be staying home in my dark place and comforting my little bichon Jack who is deathly afraid of thunder and fireworks... both of which are in town this weekend.  XOXOXO  ",

HELL NO, if I'm going to have to have it, let's do it on schedule! She also said there is a 4 week break between chemo and radiation so I'm pretty glad about that.  Thanks for the feedback on the genetic testing costs.  My surgeon put the paperwork in for me today because I definitely want to go forward with that.  My mom is a colon cancer survivor and there is a link btwn breast/colon cancer genetically.  I have two daughters who need to know if there is a genetic factor at work here. Football, everyone is different.  I was freaking out about the tamoxifen too when I found out I will need it, but the more people I talked to I see that it's individual.  Some people have absolutely no problem with it.  Plus, it's in the future - don't worry about that right now.  You are a warrior and you just fight what's in front of you today.  Focus on that Jets game (even though I'm a Giants fan, lol) and of course you'll be working out and playing guitar before long.  Right now sucks but I promise it won't always suck!!! Hang tough, girl!!! Thursday I meet with the oncologist.  I'll let y'all know any interesting info I come away with.  In the meantime, I have to set up an MRI on my right breast before radiation starts... and that's about it for now.  Can't believe only two weeks til my last infusion....
