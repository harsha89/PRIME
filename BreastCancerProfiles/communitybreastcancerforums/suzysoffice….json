I after being of the aromasin for 2 weeks the doctor told me to start again , took at night every morning i would feel the rash and within half an hour i would have blisters there , no few days ,but when i wiped it with the rubbing alchol the blisters would go half away and it would stop the itching second time go away , stopped the aromasin again after 4 days this still get rash but not that extreme, oh and of course when i get a break or a rash goes away in one area I've been treating I use curell to remosturize my skin don't need dry skin itch on top of everything, I went in for a stent in my vena cava and they couldn't do the procedure cause my veins kept collapsing I had a rash on my arm that day thought it was allergic reaction at first anyway I wanted to see if this works for anyone else then I would know it really is shilgles and not something else . Hope this helps someone! please post here and let everyone know if this worked for you!.",

I have had this about the same amount of time you have i guess my uncle gave it to me we went to the emergency room the same day. you should try alchol on the edge of your sores just on  a side thats not so bad it stung the open sores on my back till it dryed and when it dryed it again took the itch with it , i know my rash is there be fore you can see it and it is very itchy that is the symptom of shingles of course there ar variations of that my cousin says that it doesn't supprise her that it works she says when a misqiido bites her excuse the spelling that she will get up in the middle of the night and wipe it with alchol it takes the itch away. I hope you shingles fizzle out soon and mine too. Good Luck! : )",
