I think most people picture their old relatives rotting away in a bed, so they are shocked to see us doing so well! But if you were to be honest about everything you're dealing with (anger, sadness, lonely, fear) they would be uncomfortable, so it's easier to just say I'm doing fine. I read this quote the other day and fell in love with it. \"I believe that courage is not living without fear\u2014it's living in spite of fear.\" Lynn Eib I think this is what people forget. We put on a brave face, but we're still afraid. I think I'm just rambling now. I hope I made some sense. Haha",

Sometimes tired and queasy here and there but nothing major. Today and tomorrow are suppose to be the worst, so we shall see. Today, I've been able to get up and walk and do laundry.

I was able to do every cycle and remained healthy though it all even with my two kids! The one side effect that is still lingering is my neuropathy. I didn't ice but did take vitamin b6 and b12 and glutamine. My neuropathy is mostly in my feet and it's more annoying than anything. Just feels like numb feet all the time. No pain though. I keep dropping things, so I think may have slight neuropathy in my hands. So far my nails seem to be staying. I started wearing black nail polish halfway through taxol. My hair started growing back around week 8 of taxol. My eyebrows and eyelashes are still sparse. Now it's on to surgery oct 20!",
