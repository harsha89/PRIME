      "Content": "Swami7774 wrote: I just read a report about the MammaPrint test, which is apparently more involved than the Oncotype DX test. The gist of the story is that it can identify patients who won't really benefit from chemotherapy(which my wife is scheduled to begin next week). Has anyone heard of it--or had it? It's so difficult to know which route is the correct one--chemo(two courses offered by our oncologist) or NO chemo. We were told that, based on my wife's Oncotest, her chances of recurrence are 26%. With chemo, it's 16%. Whlie a 10-percent difference is significant I'd have thought chemo would lower the chances into single digits. Log in to post a reply",
