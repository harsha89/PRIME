Drain is gone thank god and stopped already with the meds. i am just feeling pretty down. i do not want to leave my house nor see anyone. i am 39 with 2 young kids and great husband but once kids are around i snap out of my depressed mood but when they are at school it's total hiding out in my room watching tv and resting all day long in complete darkness. my room is my favourite place in the world to be i swear. i get my full results next wk regarding my stage etc node involvement etc. my cancer in right breast was 7cm long so i'm quite worried about that size. i guess if i have nodes involved i'll be a stage 3? i did have all the scans done for spreading ex. ct/bone scan etc in mid nov and they came back clear. i am just so depressed i almost just want to disappear at times and never come back to this life. i swear it's so hard with young children. i also worry that the cancer will spread to other breast as i'm not removing that one until after treatment and doing reconstruction then too. sorry for the long post just wanted to let some thoughts out. thanks Log in to post a reply",
