Although I am unaware of your hemoglobin level, I saw that you reported your red blood cell (RBC) count as 3.4 in another post. Depending upon your lab, the typical RBC range is 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcL (https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003644.htm). So, 3.4 is considered low. In my case, my RBC count was 3.20 and my hemoglobin (Hgb) was 8.0 on the day of my fifth of six recommended chemo treatments. For each scheduled chemo infusion, I was supposed to receive those two delightfully toxic meds (taxotere and carboplatin) followed by the ever-more-delightful targeted HER2 positive therapy drugs: Herceptin and Perjeta. At this fifth treatment, which was June 19, 2018, I was worried. How would my organs be adequately perfused (receive proper blood flow) during a surgery if I had very low RBCs and a low Hgb? I called my my breast surgeon to learn the lowest possible Hgb level for proper organ perfusion. She told me that she insisted on a Hgb level of 9.5 or 10 on the day of the surgery. So, prior to the administration of my fifth chemo, I talked to my hematologist/oncologist and came up with the following plan: daily iron supplements taken with a vitamin C enriched drink, such as orange juice, to insure better absorption of the iron; daily increased protein intake to insure hemoglobin , which is a protein on the RBC, was properly produced and could transport oxygen; the removal of taxotere and carboplatin, the two RBC annihilators, for my sixth treatment on July 10, 2018; and the scheduling of a mastectomy for the end of July. It was June 19th. I had my fifth chemo treatment and scheduled my surgery for July 23, 2018. When my surgery date arrived, my Hgb level was 9.7. All went well......kind of.....my tumor had shrunk but i did not have a pathological complete response (pCR - which is complete destruction of the tumor- mine was smaller but had survived- dang it!). Also, I saw in another forum that your B12 was crazy elevated. I am glad to hear that the doctor is going to discuss that with you. High levels of B12, as I am sure you know, can be associated with a variety of issues. Perhaps you are overdoing vitamin B12 supplements or chemo is affecting your liver. Hope you are well. Let us know your outcome. Sending good thoughts.  Giveityourall",

After my fourth treatment, I would experience swelling from the top of my thighs to my heels. The weird thing is the swelling would always exacerbate three weeks after treatment. In other words, three weeks post chemo- I would feel better and eat more. This would result in balloon legs. Although I associate steroids, like dexamethasone, with fluid retention, I have learned that these glucocorticoids help to offset or decrease the fluid retention caused by taxotere. According to my research, taxotere causes our tiniest blood vessels, the capillaries, to become leaky. In other words, as our plasma travels through these small vessels, the fluid eeks through the capillaries\u2019 membranes and settles into our tissues (https://books.google.com/books?id=tNcoDwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA891&ots=TxGuSukgLa&dq=basic%20principles%20of%20taxotere&pg=PA891#v=onepage&q=basic%20principles%20of%20taxotere&f=false). The dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory, helps to stop this leaking. I don\u2019t know how you feel, but my skin hurts. I feel like a balloon with too much air - stretched beyond my limit. To increase fluid elimination, I did start a daily dose of Lasix 20 mg. It helps... but it does not totally eliminate my swelling. It works on the kidneys to increase urination. So, Lasix addresses the symptom, but not the cause, which is colander-like capillaries. Chemo comes with a lot of side effects and I am learning to deal with them as much as possible. I wish I understood all of this stuff before it happened rather than after. My best. Giveityourall",

I wanted that dreaded thing surgically removed and permanently gone. Months later, I still find myself reining in my needless worrying or negative thoughts. Then, I remind myself that my worrying brings no benefits. It only drains me. Then, I remember that my kids need me and I need all the energy that I can get. So, I have used You Tube to learn meditation skills and I watch Ted Talks regarding positive thinking (https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCAuUUnT6oDeKwE6v1NGQxug). You and your family have been through many ordeals....and I am not smart enough to know the appropriate words to use - ones that would provide temporary comfort or elicit incredible insights. I do know that I send my sincerest sympathies and wish you a better today or tonight. My best. Giveityourall",

In fact, I have been frustrated with the entire process. I am ANGRY. I don\u2019t know if my anger is because I hate cancer and I, for the first time, am not in control of my health - or maybe I am angry because I am grieving. I have lost my old self- the self that was not diagnosed with cancer. The old self that did not wake up every morning with anxiety; \u201cwhat if\u201d questions; and thoughts centered around mortality issues. This has been tough, As for my delayed surgery, my last chemo treatment was June 19th and my surgery date was July 23rd. During my first visit with the breast surgeon, she stated that my surgery should occur two to three weeks after my last chemo treatment. My surgery ended up being four weeks and a few days after my last chemo treatment. I was pissed because my date did not coincide with the expected plan. Also, my tumor was off the charts aggressive. I wanted that damn thing out of me. I hated it. Looking back on the scheduled surgical date, I also have to remember that I am in Tampa. There are not loads and loads of breast surgeons and hospitals. Tampa has 300,000 people and is not big enough to warrant a New York City health system. So, I had to wait. It fueled my anger. Most things did not go my way and I always felt like I was pulling the \u201cshort stick.\u201d I understand your anger. Do you live in a small town? Are there other hospitals close by? Do you have to use this particular breast surgeon? These questions are just something to ponder. Once again, I feel your frustration. We are fighting for our lives and don\u2019t always feel that we have the extra strength to fight for an earlier date. Somehow... we get what we need to get done - even if it is a small modification. My best. Giveityoural ",
