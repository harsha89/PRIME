I was finally diagnosed with a intraductal papilloma a month ago after mammo, sono and MRI guided biopsy.  My surgeon wasn't satisfied with the \"benign\" path report either.  I have a long family background of BC so it has been decided that the area with margins needs to be excised to make sure there is no cancer hiding in there.  I'm having this done on October 1st.  I had pretty much calmed down after the biospy but now my gut is rolling again and I can't keep my mind off of what \"might be\".  I'm not too bad right now but by next Thursday I will be a wreck.

      "Content": "Aug 15, 2009 03:05AM - edited Aug 15, 2009 03:06AM by sheila1951 I too have an appointment with a breast surgeon next Wednesday.  According to my MRI readings I am to have a biopsy guided by either sono or MRI.  I doubt this will happen on Wednesday but wish it would.  I have been thru this so many times that this seems like a routine bad dream I have.  5 biopsies (all B9) in the past 15 or so years.  I worry, yet I don't worry.  I think I \"stew\" about it more than I worry.  Check every possible word from my MRI reports on the internet, read into every meaning that I have cancer.  Everyone hugs me and says that it will be alright.  Those are the ones who have never had to go thru this or wait for an appointment or wait for a biopsy and results. I have told my kids (once again) but I'm afraid they are beginning to think of me as the boy who cried wolf.  I kind of feel like that at times too.  My kids are 30, 38 & 39. (Had to stop and think about how old they are! :) Lets do a 3 way virtual hand holding and pray ourselves and each other to be B9.",
