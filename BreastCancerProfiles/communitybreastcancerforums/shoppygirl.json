I mean every time I saw them I would be in hysterical tears!!! It was so out if character for me to be that way but I was so scared and worried at that time that I could not control my emotions.  People cannot understand how hard this is. I can remember right after I was dx it was my 42nd birthday and my girlfriends were taking me out for dinner. My neighbour/friend came over to pick me up and I just started to sob uncontrollably.  She just stood there in my kitchen, staring at me with this confused look on her face. Did not try to comfort me or anything. Honestly I have not felt the same about her since then.  It is good to let your emotions out and I really don't have time anymore for someone that does not understand that. ",

My oncologist also recommended that I have another CT scan right after I finished chemotherapy. It was about five weeks after I finished my treatment. I believe the protocol for anybody that has a lung nodule is to rescan it every 6 months or year. In our case, as it was found during cancer it's a little different It sounds like you are going to the same thing I did four years ago. This scan I had after chemo showed no change so then I had another one every year for two years with also no change. I no longer have to have the lung nodule scanned as I completed all the follow up with no issues. It was determined to be a scar from a prior infection. I'm sure this is very scary and nerve-racking for you as nobody wants to have something show up on their scan that they have to keep getting looked at. I think it is very positive that you have a nodule from before as that would indicate that your body is just the type to grow such things. Good luck and I am sending positive thoughts for benign results !! ",

The results showed it to be benign but I still followed up with a Thyroid dr last Thursday just to be careful. Mine is quite large at 3cm. The dr advised last week that it was indeed benign but due to its size he would normally want to remove it. As I am due to have an ooph next Thursday he is following it up with another ultrasound in June and then he will decide when to remove it. The FNA was not painful, just kind of uncomfortable and weird to have a needle put in your throat. Also if you are claustrophobic then just be aware that they put a sheet over your face, I guess to avoid any germs getting in. I drove myself to the procedure and went back to work afterwards. If you are concerned about it, having the FNA might give you piece of mind.  Good luck. ",

My oncologist originally told me that I had a T1 Tumor as you don't add them together and I was stage 1b or 2a.

In addition to the confusion about the staging she tried to talk me out of having my ovaries removed even though I have a family history of ovarian cancer. Also, even though I have already lost 20 pounds and am a healthy weight, she told me I needed to lose 6 more pounds to have the perfect bmi. The funny thing was that she was about 70 pounds overweight herself! Now I know how hard it is to lose weight but she was so aggressive about me losing even more weight, it was strange!

To answer your question, you should remove your wig at night as it will be very tangled and all that rubbing on the pillow will not be good for it. Also you will want to take it off as it is like wearing a hat all the time! You will have to wash in the sink about twice a week. My wig started to shed a lot especially on the top so I took it back to where I bought it and had them change the part and trim it.",

Hopefully the ct scan will give you some more insight it to what is going on. Good luck and hugs.",

If you search lung nodule in this site you will see that so many if us have had this type of incidental finding.

Also radiation can make them change. My radiology oncologist told me that. I have met several women with lung nodules and they were not mets. I know it is difficult to always be dealing with the stress of this. I almost drove myself to the point of despair over my nodule but as mine did not show any change after chemo I am having another scan in a year.

I am very disgusted that she is painting such an unrealistic picture of breast cancer and how difficult it is to go through treatment. This just adds to all the people out there that think that BC and all the treatments that go with it are so easy and something that you instantly recover from!   Thank you Kebab for starting this thread. Sorry to be posting in the stage 4 thread but I had to rant about this!   Hugs to all !! ",

As far as taking pain meds my oncologist told me that as long as I take my temp before I take anything and it is normal then go ahead. You should not have to suffer. This is difficult enough to get through as it is! I also had terrible constapation and found that taking two sennakot s before bed and also a teaspoon of lactalose during the day for the first 5 days quickly cured it. Also prune juice works amazing as well. Take care, we are here for you!",
