What would be the best route to go Needle, or punch or excisional biopsy? I am scared of being put under for biopsy. Should I have more than one week of cipro for mastitis first? Should I have an ultrasound before the biopsy? No, pain, just pinkness/red.  No enlarged lymph nodes, no crust on nipple, areola has not changed in color same as other breast. It has been this way for awhile. Should I have a mammogram of my other breast? Does it make a difference, on what type of biopsy is done, if any one else in family like grandmother, aunt, or sister has had, breast cancer we are not sure on this only was rumor? He told me that punch biopsies are only for skin lesions and biopsies of the skin, it would only show dermal lymphatic involvement on the inflamed skin. IBC is cancer of the breast, not the skin - that skin just is reacting on the breast that over lies the area of the tumor.  And that this cannot be detected by a punch biopsy But, what if you don't have a tumor or mass to do an excisional biopsy He is telling me that the only way to that to diagnose IBC for sure is with the incisional breast biopsy. Is this true?    I am scared of being put under for biopsy. From what I am reading on the internet, it is ok or preferred to rule out mastitis, by taking for at least two weeks of antibiotics. Then having a punch biopsy, then ultrasound, and maybe a guide excisional biopsy, or MRI. Can you help me at all on this... I am scared, I don't want to have to have  incisional breast biopsy - Already lost my husband to cancer... Log in to post a reply",

What I found says \"\"Dr. Lucci of MD Anderson -- says incisional the way to test this-- any idea where I can fine this?",
