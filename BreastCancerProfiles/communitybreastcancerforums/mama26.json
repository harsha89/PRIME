My biggest complaint from surgery is the muscle spasms. My chest gets as hard as a rock. I am taking muscle relaxers but they aren't working very well. I've tried a heating pad also with little relief. I have my first fill next week. I hope that doesn't make the spasms worse. I'm hoping for great results for all of you as well. Take care. Melanie",

They said I was having muscle spasms in my pectoral muscles. Ouch. I hope all of the other surgeries went well too. Praying for all. ",
