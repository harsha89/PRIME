I have my first visit with the RO this coming Wednesday. Since I am a good candidate for brachytherapy I am already scheduled to have the device implanted the following day. I will start treatment the day after Labor Day. We will be staying in a hotel with a full kitchen for the course of treatment to be near where it is done. I expect to be uncomfortable and can see from reading different posts that it is different for everyone. Since we live a good distance from the place where therapy will take place, my husband and I will be staying at a hotel with a full kitchen nearby the RO office. I would appreciate any suggestions you all may have that will help me get through more comfortably. I plan on preparing main meals ahead and freezing them. Thought of things like protein smoothies and such, but not even sure what to expect as far as appetite goes. My head just swims thinking about the whole thing. Looking forward to putting it behind me and moving on to the healing process.",

I had my lumpectomy which included removing some lymph nodes last Wednesday and although I'm a bit sore, I am quite surprised at how comfortable I am. My good news is all margins were clear as were the lymph nodes. I will be having my radiation device implanted a week from Thursday and treatment the following week. Thank you for sharing your experience. It is very comforting to know what to expect.",
