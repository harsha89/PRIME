Saw my surgeon last night and he told me that he removed 3 nodes that at the time looked good, upon further review they found that 2 had micro metastases, 1 didn't. He also said my tumor was 3cm (making it stage 2b). He gave me number to an oncologist and said that most likely this person will suggest chemo just on the strength of my age and the size of the tumor. My breast surgeon said he is on the fence as to what i should do (remove all nodes or chemo or what) because the cancer cells were so tiny and only in the 2. Oh and i'm BRCA negative. My mom had BC when she was 46, same boob as me and had a mastectomy (no chemo or anything). She's 70 now and never had any problems after.   i got an appt for dec. 1st with the onc.  any advice/suggestions on my situation, what to ask the oncologist, anything? thanks Kendall  Dx 8/20/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB, 2/22 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I assumed it was due to being pre-menstrual.  they did mammo and ultrasound and a doc looked at ny utrasoud and said \"i'm concerned it may be early breat cancer, you need a needle biopsy\". So here on my 1st experience i ended up having a needle biopsy and i'm terrified of needles. today the doc who did the needle biopsy called me at 2:02pm and said it was benign but still looked suspicious but that \"they can look odd but still be benign and this is how you are\" At 2:51pm she called me back and said that the lab was looking at the wrong papers and that my lump is malignant. she called it invasive ductal carcinoma.  she told me to call my primary doc who referred me for the tests and get a hold of a breast surgeon.  i'm livid now and pissed and scared.  i called my doc's office and was told that she never should have called me with any results, good or bad, that when a lab sees cancer they call the patients doctor and send everything to the doctor who then calls the patient.  my doc's office had not recieved any info from them at that time. I am going tomorrow to see what's up. i'm praying and staying positive that the first result of benign is still right but if its not, i'm scared to death to go through treatment. i have no idea what goes on, i've never been hospitalized for anything.  someone told me to go prepared with questions and a note pad. can anyone tell me what to ask, anything...i have no real question for you guys...i just want to hear back from anyone with advice, suggestions, knowledge, wisdom...all of the above.  :) Thanks a lot Kendall Dx 8/20/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIB, 2/22 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

So this means my chances of developing a second cancer in the other breast or ovarian is 5%, if I was positive for the mutation it would be 66%. Also, if I were positive for the mutation I would pass it on to my future children. So I don't have to worry about that. Breast MRI-no funny business in the infected boob except for what we already know about. Nothing in the healthy breast and nothing showed up in the lymph nodes although he will still be checking them during surgery (sentinel node biopsy). Tentative dates for surgery-November 2 or 5, depends on when plastic surgeon comes back from vacation which I will find out today hopefully. I'm still going to go ahead with the bi-lateral mastectomy and reconstruction because if I remove the infected boob and reconstruct it, the plastic surgeon will not enhance the healthy one until the infected boob is finished, so it would call for me to go back into surgery later on down the road for the healthy boob. Also, these boobies and I have always had a love/hate relationship and after all this stress, I feel like I want something good to come out of it...like a B cup! take care ladies! Kendall",

Anyway the receptionist said she didn't see any new info in my file. how long does it typically take to set up surgery and what are the steps?  i don't want to be sitting here waiting when i should be doing something else, ya know?  let me know... kendall ",

How the hell do i make a decision?  he gave me number of plastic surgeon he works with, i'm gonna call him and make an appt. so that i can find out EXACTLY how this reconstruction shit is done. If i do that, i'm not trying to get some big boobies, at most a small B maybe or a full A since i never filled out an A cup bra. Again though, how the hell do i decide? he said he prefers to wait to get BRCA results before scheduling surgery and BRCA comes back in 2 weeks. He said lumpectomy and mastectomy with no reconstruct will be same day. With reconstruct would be 1-2 day hospital stay.  The least amount of days stay for me the better! i have hospital phobia anyway. the white walls and the smell get my heart racing. so input ladies...i need input love ya kendall ",

BS said onc. will do blood tests and other tests to make sure it hasn't spread anywhere. What other tests?    oh and my tumor is stage 2b due to the size being 3cm. any thoughts? ",

Wang HY, Ali RS, Chen SC, Chao TC, Cheng MH. Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Chang Gung University, Tao Yuan, Taiwan. The Asian breast reconstruction patient is usually of lower mean age, lower body mass index (BMI), and has relatively small breasts. This study aimed to investigate the outcome of 1-stage immediate breast reconstruction using saline-filled implants in the Asian patients.Between April 2002 and July 2005, 30 patients underwent skin-sparing mastectomy and 1-stage immediate breast reconstruction with a saline-filled implant. Mean age was 42.9 years, with a mean BMI of 21.9 and a mean implant volume of 283 mL.The overall success rate was 96.6%, with 1 case of implant exposure secondary to chest skin necrosis. At mean follow-up of 21.5 months (range 6 to 40 months), 1 patient developed local recurrence (3.33%).Perfusion of the chest skin flap is reliable enough to allow 1-stage breast reconstruction with small saline-filled breast implants. We present this as an additional option for immediate breast reconstruction in thin women with small breasts. PMID: 18362560 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]  ",

The good news is that he does immediate reconstruction with implants (direct to implant, one step...all those damn names), the bad news is that due to my being so damn petite (i'm only 5'2\", 80lbs, lost a few pounds...well only 4 LOL), he said the skin the surgeon will be removing will be a significant loss on me therefore he's concerned i won'thave enough skin to hold an implant and he does not want me to be tight. SO...he showed me the expander most women get but the smallest size it comes in is too big for me, would go all into my underarm. Then he showed me one that comes small enough for me that is an expander/implant because it can be left in after desired size is reached if woman wants to and doesn't mind having saline implants. Otherwise, it works like an expander with weekly fills and can be replaced with a silicone implant. he said that looking at me he thinks a 100cc implant would give me a full A, therefore he thinks that on me every 100cc's will increase me by a cup size, I forget the number he said the typically fills other women to a cup size increase but its more than that. naturally he said the length of time will depend on how i tolerate the filling process. He likes to start off with small amounts of fill and if i tell him to put more to see if i can handle it he will. he explained that some women tell him to put 50 or more cc's and if they are uncomfortable for 2-3 days they come back to him and he removes some, he said that you want to be comfortable during the process. He showed me pictures and they were really good. hmmm what else...oh he said fills would start about 3 weeks after the surgery to give me time to get rid of drains and heal a bit.  i've been talking to my body telling it, \"now listen, this is gonna be smooth sailing. don't give any problems. heal quickly, so we can keep it moving. I have things to do and people to see\" LMAO My girlfriends said that after this whole process is over, they will throw me an \"Unveiling of the Boobies\" party! LOL I definitely may take up weekly wine drinking and become a wineaux (that's the classy version of the wine-o) Kendall",

Its 4 pages. this is what each page says: page 1- at the top it says \"Benign-fibrocytic changes of breast and cysts with apocrine metaplasia. pathology findings are not felt to be consistent witht eh suspicious imaging findings. excision is advised\". At the bottom is the correction and that says \"the pathologist phoned to indicate that there was an error in the original report. correct diagnosis is invasive ductal carcinoma, mri is recommended as well as excision\"  Page 2-this is regarding the ultrasound guided large core needle biopsy and this says a whole lot of crap including, \"an Inrad clip was placed\"   page 3-is the bilateral mammo with CAD: says that the breast tissue is very dense, there is a grouping of 3-4 microcalcifications...no skin thickening or nipple retraction... page 4-bilateral ultrasound:there is a 12x13 mm irregular solid nodule. no other cysts or solid lesions are identified. small benign appearing lymph nodes are seen in both axillary regions\"  so there you go....i was given the name of a breast surgeon to go to. i called but they are closed until monday so i left a message to make an appointment.  ideally i would like to get an appt. for monday or tuesday to get the ball rolling because months ago i planned a trip to Los Angeles for aug 26-30. what is the consensus about my trip?  i live in NY on Long Island any of you ladies from there?  Hugs!

So my current surgeon is right about that.  i looked up converting from mm to cm and on a path report i have from the first lab my size says 12mm x 13mm, so i figured that is 1.2cm x 1.3cm....that doesn't sound big does it?  Kendall ",
