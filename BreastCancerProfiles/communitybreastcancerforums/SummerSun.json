I have a family history of breast cancer and have decided to have a double mastectomy. I don't mind telling you all, I am terrified, but, am grateful I found it early. I have read many of the posts here and am so glad I found this forum. There are so many amazing and strong women going through this. I hope and pray that we all get through this and are able to provide support and comfort for those that will follow us. I plan to have reconstructive surgery using my own tissue, either DIEP or TRAM. I would greatly appreciate any advice from anyone that has either procedure.

I know what you are going through. It was the hardest thing I ever went through at that point in my life. The good Lord gave us 2 years with her before she passed. Know that every second you spend with her is precious to her. You will reflect on those moments the rest of your life. I am sure that your grandmother loves you more than you will ever know and takes sweet comfort in all the time that she spends with you. Please make sure that you are diligent in your breast exams. I was just diagnosed last week with DCIS (ductal cancer) and am the same age as my grandmother was when she was diagnosed. I found it myself, so the prognosis is good. I will pray that your grandmother gets through this and for The Lord to wrap his loving arms around you both. ",

The radiologist said that she couldn't really see anything concerning. There was a vague indication of something, but, she was not concerned. They also did a mammogram and nothing showed up on that. Since I found it and was concerned she ordered a needle biopsy. The Dr that did the biopsy said he fully expected the result to come back benign. Well, it wasn't. I was diagnosed with DCIS and opted for a BMX since my grandmother passed from bone mets. After the BMX, the pathology report came back with IDC as well. You know your body better than anyone and are doing the right thing seeing another Dr. There are a lot of great women here that will chime in to answer your questions. I know how distressing this can be, but, if needed, this forum is a wonderful place for information, support and comfort. Hopefully this is nothing, but, keep us posted. Take care.",
