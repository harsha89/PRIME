Three came back with Lobular carcinoma in SITU.  We put our trip on hold and made appointment with Onc. Surgeon.  She said, not a major problem as it is not invasive but she still wanted me to have an MRI.  MRI confirmed what was going on on right side but also showed a suspicious area on the left side.  Of couse I assumed it was probably just scar tissue from the previous lumpectomy but was totally blown away when I had a MRI guided biopsy that came back with invasive lobular carcinoma.   Have an appt. this Tues. to discuss plan of action.   After the initial first news I was shaken up for a few days but felt confident it was just a small bump in the road and early detection and soon will be ready to go.  This second dx. has really hit home and I know I will have to make some drastic decisions.  It helps a lot to have so many friends and family showing so much concern.  I am also very grateful for sites like this to read about many other people's thoughts, concerns and what I will be facing very soon.  Keep up the good work girls.  I am with you all in this had time we all have to go thru.  Take care and let's all keep encouraging each other",
