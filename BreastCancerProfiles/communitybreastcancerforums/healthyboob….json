My doctor told me that your chances of getting breast cancer in the other non-cancer breast raises by 1% every year. I was 26 when I was diagnosed (3 years ago) and that meant that by the time I was 36, I would have a 10% chance of getting it again. For me, it's ease of mind. My new little boobies are healthy. They might not look like my old ones, but they are mine - and a reminder of how strong I was to make such a proactive and smart decision.",
