Dr called today to say clear margins but with further testing now showing node is cancerous.Sure did bust my happy bubble.I go to oncologist/radiologist tomorrow am.I'm not sure how this changes my prognosis. My tumor was 7mm with all tissue removal still less than 2cm.I was wondering do i go back and have more lymph nodes removed or does radiation/chem take take of them? Did i go from stage one to stage 2 or three?",

Back to surgeon on Wednesday for more info. Body scans Friday then if scan shows anything alarming we will weigh the surgery. If scan is clean we will proceed with surgery. With info we have now he says 6 chemo treatments. Then radiation for six weeks. My tumor was removed 9-22 and was 1.9 c. Sentinel node tested positive after stain. I worry so much about the next surgery fear of lymph edema. I also feel as though maybe over kill but you want to give them all the info possible to treat you. I love this site so informative and interesting. My favorite sites used to be Facebook and my grandchildren's blogs. Amazing how a BC diagnosis changes your life........",

After that i'm sure they will be taking me in for the additional node removal. After all we don't know about any of the others cause only sential was removed. Surgeon did say he saw no more nothing else showed up. ...............IsThisForReal: Good luck it is tuff, been there done that. You can do it!!!!!!!",

I will hopefully talk to him later today to find out WHY. He told me what would happen with rads but I should have chemo first. My appt is for Oct11,this is such a slow process. My mammo was Aug 3 follow up mammo the 19 biopsy Aug 30. Diagnosis Sept. 1.Lumpectomy on Sept 22.everything is hurry up and wait. I would be content with the fact that the tumor is gone if only i knew if any more nodes were involved other that the one and only one removed. ",

About Jan 2012 I felt like my breast was drawing up. After a while I had a left breast that was 36ddd and a right about a C. Very very firm very very painful. I called my RO who said he only followed up for a month. Which I did have that visit but at the time only had burns that looked like they were healing. Next I went back to surgeon to see if he thought what I looked like was normal. He promptly call my RO and said you need to see this patient. RO called it chemo radiation induced fibrosis. I took gabapentin for nerve pain also trental and vitamin E to increase blood supply. No change, I developed some pretty severe sores. I have been to PT cause we are also sure a lot of this is lymphatic fluid. The massages help move the fluid but is difficult due to the sores. I went to a plastic surgeon because I feel as though a mastectomy is probably in my future. The PS said he thought he could help without surgery. He suggested a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. I did that five days a week for 8 weeks. This did somewhat help with sores but seemed to make lymphedema worse so I quit. I have searched this site over for anything similar and have not found anything until this post. Not sure since the info is limited. I have narrowed it down to Radiation induced morphea. http://www.hindawi.com/crim/rheumatology/2011/951948/  I have been referred to Emory in Atlanta. The radiation section with a dermatologist. Maybe it will take a rheumatologist I don't know. Sorry to go on and on but just no other place to post my rant. I have posted before on the radiation site but was told I may want to see a PT which of course I had done. This goes far beyond PT. I just so hope Emory has some ideas and or answers. I have printed the website and after listening to the Dr will show the site and see what they think.  Even though I post hardly I read daily. I respect the women on these pages. I have gathered a lot of information whether it be on chemo or radiation. Just keep searching for information about this breast issue and have nothing. Please advise if anyone has heard of it experienced it. I would love some relief. Thanks for listening\u2026\u2026..Diane",
