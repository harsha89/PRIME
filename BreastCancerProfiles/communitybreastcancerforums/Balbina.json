After getting second and third opinions, I had my mastectomy and lymph nodes removed in late July. I healed well after the surgery, although I still have some arm stiffness and pain. Now they are recommending AC x4 -Tx4, dose dense because of some positive lymph nodes. I am supposed to start the chemo on Wednesday. Needless to say, I am quite scared and worried about the treatment and all the side effects, especially the long term stuff. Can't eat, can't sleep, cant relax and I have not even started. I do not have any support system besides my husband and 2 teen kids, and I have not told anyone that I am going through this except for some close family members and a few friends who are all living in Europe. I tried looking for a local support group (I am in Boston area), but was not successful. So, I went online and luckily, I found this forum. It is so great to meet all of you! It definitely feels less lonely....  ",
