I have never had a pet scan though I had bone scan and ct chest abdomen and pelvis. Please advise whether I should demand a pet scan from MO.She always seem so reluctant to order that. It will be for my peace of mind too. Did anybody experience fatigue and weakness after the treatment was over. I am otherwise active and do a treadmill 3-4 times a day but not from the last week.

I was painfree the whole time and started walking the next day. My drains were taken out the 7thday (only two ) one on each side. My surgeon did not recommend any particular exercise rather said that take things easy and gradually increase your activity. I have read people doing exercises. At what point should I start stretching. I try a little bit but i am still unable to raise both arms staright up although they go half way. I did not have any reconstruction done. Please advice if this is normal. Also I have sensitive chest wall so much so that even cloth touching becomes annoying any tips for that also. I will be grateful. Log in to post a reply",
