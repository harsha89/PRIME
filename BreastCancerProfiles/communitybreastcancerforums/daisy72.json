My oncologist said if my tumor was less than 5mm I wouldn't have needed chemo but mine was 8mm. Reading on google is not good, it will scare you. Take one day at a time, that's what I'm trying to do. I'm scared of chemos but I have learned so much from these boards on how to handle the side effects. These ladys are wonderful! Please let us know how things are going for you! ",

We can't go back later and do a redo, this is our only chance to get you cancer free, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT! I will get you through this treatment even if you have to come every single day and get fluids. Now tell me what you need to help you fight?\" I said NERVE MEDICATION! At that time, this round worried me so bad all I did was cry and cry. I couldn't imagine doing it 3 more times. So he put me on some nerve meds and gave me xanax, and boy what a difference it has made! It calmed me down to feel like I can do this, I want to be cancer free. I can fight my way through this!  I know some people aren't big fans of nerve medication, I've never been either but during a time like this I knew I needed something to help calm me and get me through this 'journey'. I hardly take the xanax at all. I only take them when I feel like it's going to be a really bad day, and they help a lot.  Today's round went good, in and out nothing major. I had a good talk with my main chemo nurse. She was telling me to take my nausea meds around the clock the first 3-4 days even if I felt I didn't need them, start using my magic mouthwash before i felt any pain or soreness in my mouth or throat, and to drink 96 oz of fluids a day to try to prevent dehydration, and to start taking constipation meds now to keep that from happening again. So I'm doing all that earlier, hopefully it'll help.  WE can get through this, we are tough woman! i'm so glad I have ya'll to talk too and read about everyday, It makes me feel better that I'm not the only person going through this! Thank you!",

Starting with a sore throat, wished i'd knew that was the start of the 'chemo mouth sores' by the time I called my doctor, it was so bad I couldn't eat and barely drink. They called me in some 'Magic mouth wash' which helped a lot. I also knew to drink, drink and drink some more, so I did...still again, dehydrated. I've been back to the cancer center 5 times in the past 8 days for IV fluids. Another is constipation, that has been the worse side effect. Mira-lax worked well for me. During all this I've felt so bad all I did was cry and cry, no reason, just crying and crying. I did get a Neulasta shot which causes terrible and I mean terrible bone pain, the worst pain I've felt in a long time. They gave me Oxycodone for the pain. Since my nerves have been on edge they put me on a antidepressants, that has help a lot too, along with a nice RX of xanax. I'm feeling back to my old self the past few days, but I'm gearing up for my next round next Thursday. I also did shave my head, it feels a bit sore and I've noticed I'm loosing hair 'other places' so I knew it was time. I don't mean to scare anyone that's getting ready to start chemo, I just want ladies to know what could happen. Please call your oncologist at the first sign of any problems because they can and will help you through this journey. I feel like they have given me all the tools I need now to go into round 2. Three more rounds and I'm done!!  Keep up the fight, we got this!! ",

They did give me extra nausea med's. and nerve medication. The crying and crying was terrible, especially for my poor husband and kids, they didn't know how to help me and I didn't know why I cried so much. Guess It was 'why me' thing, I don't know. I work for Hospice and when I got diagnosed I had 2 patients that I saw several times a week with breast cancer, so I went into their homes listening to the families talk about this horrible disease and I couldn't say 'I was just diagnosed too'. I had to be the professional and do my job, while I was scared out of my mind. Thinking has it spread? Will I be a Hospice patient soon? My mind went crazy. My doctor said I had the most stressful job there is and I needed to take a leave as soon as possible, after I showed up at her office crying like a baby in between seeing my patients 3 days after I was diagnosed. I LOVE my job though. I love helping family's and patients during the end of life process. I will go back as soon as I able. My oncologist has taken me out for 6 months, giving me time for treatment and healing.  So I'm ready to get all this behind me...I'm ready to face the side effects better this time around!

Felt terrible, nauseated, and very weak. My daughter who's 18 actually called my doctor the first time to let them know I felt bad and they said bring her immediately for IV fluids she dehydrated. After I got those fluids I felt like a new person, I could actually eat! So from then on when I start to notice I'm not urinating as much and I'm feeling terrible I just call my Nurse Navigator, with in minutes she has a order from my doctor and calls me right back and says come now, they are waiting on you! My doctor said we'll give you fluids everyday if that's what it takes to get you through treatment. They say I'm drinking enough, I'm doing nothing wrong, it's just the chemo, steroids and nausea meds combined. Hopefully, this next one will not be as hard...oh and thank God for my port...that would have been a lot of sticks!  We now keep me a chemo bags in every car, just in case we have to go again in a hurry. Blanket, socks, snacks, tablet, puzzle book and hard candy. IV fluids take an hour and half or more every time I go, but well worth it!",

I saw an oncologist yesterday (mine on vacation, how dare him at a time like this?..lol) He was very very nice though, he said the would NOT be cutting my Cytoxan dose at all, but would be cutting my Taxotere only by 20%. They think all my side effects was coming from taxotere. My blood counts was good he said, so we are on GO! Tomorrow will be the nuelasta shot. I also have to see my surgeon again tomorrow, I had a 7cm seroma drained from my boob (complication from my lumpectomy, terrible infection, took 3 weeks of antibiotics to clear) a few days before round 1 and a ultrasound this week showed it's back but slighly smaller only 5cm now. Boy I sure wished I'd just opt'd for Mastectomy on that side!! It's too late now, I don't believe they will do anything else because of fear of more infection, which I can not afford on this stage of the game.  So ROUND 2, here I come!! Thank you all for sharing your stories, thoughts, side effects, fears and LOVE! ",
