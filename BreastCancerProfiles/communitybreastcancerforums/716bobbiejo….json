Well, the office did not have enough doses of A/C in house, so my treatment will be given in reverse order.  Not happy about the change, but I just need to focus on the fact that it's just a bump in the road & I'm ultimately still getting the treatment I need. I was told in the office yesterday that my hair will likely thin, but it may or may not fall out.  Any research I've done online says it will fall out.  In fact one website indicates that it will fall out in 96% of patients.  Anyone have any personal insights they'd like to share?  Thinking I was getting A/C first, my plan was to shave my head prior to the 2nd treatment (roughly 12-13 days from now).  Should I still move forward with this plan???
