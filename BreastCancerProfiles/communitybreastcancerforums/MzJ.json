Usually for me, ear/nose/throat issues tend to move around between my head,nose,throat & chest.   This time I've got no other symptoms, no runny nose, no scratchy throat, no cough.  Just the headaches.         All the doctors and all the nurses assure me the headaches have nothing to do with the radiation treatment.  I've completed 15 of 30 zappings.  The fatigue is building and I definately blame the headaches for that.",

But the bad news is,  a few hours later, my head HURTS, right behind my eyes. No sneezing, no congestion; just pain.  It's been like this for 10 straight days now. I'm going to discuss this again with the doctor.   Has anyone here had sinus headaches during radiation treatment? What did you take? I've got 4 weeks of rads to go. I don't think I can keep taking Advil & ibuprofen 3 times a day. What if the headaches don't stop even after rads stop?

I'm sure the weather is what brought the headaches on, but I fear that radiation is playing a part in why it's so hard to kick.  I think I read it weakens our immune system.  I worry about taking so much Advil and ibuprofen; I bet it's not good for my stomach and I'm building up a tolerance :(",

Started Tamoxifen a month ago.  Last week I had my followup mammogram and it went great!)",

Guess I gotta make do with what I've got.      A few times I have found something that looked promising.  Once I got up enough nerve and submitted a resume. It was so hard not to mention it to co-workers.  I was on pins and needles for days expecting an interview request.  Ego smack!  I never got a reply.    So I say, go ahead and look for a better job. It's empowering to take action, don't feel trapped.   If you find a great job, awesome! Go for it!   But don't leave your current job until you have another one confirmed. That's not being trapped, just being an economical realist.    In the meantime, try to look at work as just work.  Do your best. Then go home and enjoy your family time.",
