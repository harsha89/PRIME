I am also on hormonal therapy and was having side effects - bones hurt, no energy, , not sleeping. When I saw the oncology nurse at the beginning of December, she was sooo helpful. She told me to take Aleve PM at night to sleep better and to also take Glucosamine/Chondroitin for the bone pain. I did both and immediately I felt so good. Those two things alone have done more for me than anything else I've tried. Hope it helps someone else too.",

I did develop lesions after the radiation and tried everything to clear them up as they were quite painful. Finally, in desperation, I tried using Castor Oil and massaging that into the skin where there were lesions. The lesions cleared up in 4 - 5 days. What a miracle!",
