      "Content": "SisterPeace wrote: Greetings!  Today I went by myself in the rain and slush by train into Manhattan for a mammo and US.  After 6 hours I emerged from the hospital a bit dazed and almost disoriented.  By the time I left it was dark outside and I hadn't seen out a window all day.  Neither had I drank or eaten anything in all that time.  There wasn't a sign about no eating, but none of the other women were either.  This  definitely contributed to my feeling weak after such a stressful day.  I drank some OJ and ate a banana before I headed back to the train.  So, one suggestion I would have for others is to bring a snack, at least to eat when you are finished.  You don't need low blood sugar added to your difficulties.  In the meantime, I had at least 20 mammograms shots taken, a bilateral US and two core US guided biopsies, one in each breast.  I was not given Xanax, which was just as well since I was weak enough by the end of the day.  It took me an hour to get home, thankfully I got on the right train. The biopsies did not hurt.  The dr. was excellent at administering the initial numbing shots.  During the procedure I felt only pressure.  The second one was difficult for the dr.  She had to take many samples to get what she wanted.  She said that she gets results back by 1pm the following day and would call me. Thank you to Lori and Robby for encouraging me about setting the date and getting this done.  Now I'll go get those ice packs for one last round before going to sleep. Peace be with you, Sister Sister Log in to post a reply",
