I'm not sure why since there was no comparison when I had my first. It is taking a long to get my first results. They are going to do a sonagram Tuesday. Is that normal? I know I shouldn't worry but it is very hard. I have always had an inverted nipple on my rightside, but it used to come back out. Now it won't come out it just stays inverted. Everytime I go to the restroom, I have to look at them.I do not feel any bumps, but under my right arm pit is sore. I know I shouldn't worry but I can't stop. Any advice? Log in to post a reply",
