Unfortunately, she got diagnosed with BC two weeks ago, after a long jurney of suffering, confusion and hopeless GP visits. I'll try to keep a very long story as short as possible. It's sad and unforgivable that it had to get as far and serious for her to be complaining about constant right rib cage pain, shortnesses of breath, massive headache attacks combined with nausea and vomiting to finally get her addmited to the hospital. She was with me at the same ER two times before where she would get eventually discharged with some painkillers blaming migrane or PTSD. (90's war refugee) On her third emergency visit she got diagnosed with pneumonia and was put on antibiotics for two weeks, follow up chest x-ray showed deterioration so her GP decided to change antibiotics. She was put on augmentin forte but the nausea and vomiting and headaches kept getting worse, she also developed three bumps on her head that felt like bumps kids get when they hit their heads against something. The doctors then decided to do a CT of her chest,  spots were found all over her right lung and two on her left breast, a mamography was next and a biopsy sample got taken out. MRI of her sceleton showed multiple mets on her skull, right arm, shoulder bone, ribs, hip and leg. This is when she preliminarily got diagnosed with stage IV BC with a widespread metastatic disease. One tumor at the back of her skull was aparently intracerebral and had potential to grow and push against vital brain tissue, quick decision was made and everybody agreed to have it surgically removed. Neurosurgents removed it in 3 hours and soon after leaving the theater she was talking to me and grabbing my hand at the ICU. Today is exactly a week since the brain surgery and she got discharched yesterday already. The pathology report is supposed to be ready this Tuesday (in 5 days) and a follow up appointment has been arranged with her to discuss further steps. It all came as a big unexpected shock to all of us but now I'm trying to get my head around it, there's just way too many things that don't add up for me. I don't know why I even registered here but I guess I'm grasping for some third party opinion from people who know what I'm talking about? Mind you we're in Sydney Australia so don't get confused if we call some things differently or abbrevations aren't the same, I need to know more and I need to know what to do. Her english is not good and I'm the only one she's got to take care of her, I really need to know more and I'll update the topic after the Tuesday pathology report meeting. Appreciate any feedback.  Dx 3/20/2012, IDC, Stage IV Log in to post a reply",

Mom is on 1mg Arimidex (anastrozole) at the moment + Lorazepam, Esomeprazole, Metaclopramide and Oxycodone, plus weaning off post-op Dexamethasone. She's feeling relatively good so far and is being fairly positive. The surgery seams to have been very successful, she's free of headaches and nausea and has got her apetite back. All we can do for now is hope that the histopathology report will confirm the initial diagnosis and spare us more horrible surprises like two different primaries of some sort...",
