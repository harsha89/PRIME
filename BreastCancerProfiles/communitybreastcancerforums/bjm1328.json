Breast MRI's are worse than back MRI's in my experience!  Here's to Friday coming quickly with good news! Dragonfly55: I noticed when I read your post that our dates were the same for our mammogram and that I had my repeat bx on the day you got your diagnosis (I hope your diagnosis is not a bad one...you meet with a BS on 11/24 - which is actually Thanksgiving here - so I hope everything is alright) It has been a very long time since the first mammogram...a week from right now I will be home recovering from the wire-guided excisional bx. Can't wait til that's over!!   Thanks for your words of understanding and support. Most people don't understand that it's never really far from your thoughts each day when you're going through this.",

The wire-guided part was not all that bad. The excisional biopsy in the OR went well. The surgeon removed a half dollar sized chunk of tissue and will have the results next Monday. I still have a huge dressing covering the whole left breast so I don't know what it wiill look like yet. I don't have much breast tissue to spare!  I'm just happy to be home and on the mend. Taking vicodin as needed...I needed it last evening for sure. I also have a really bad sore throat from the tube ...  so much so that it was bleeding most of the day yesterday. Seems to have stopped bleeding so far today.   Thank you for your support and I hope you are doing well today lc1975! ",

Phew!  Big relief!  The surgeon set up an appointment to see the oncologist though to discuss Tamoxifen because of hyperplasia with atypia. That's not til December so I'm relaxing and recovering for now. Nasty scar so far and a little deformed from surgery but all in all feeling extremely fortunate. I hope you get good news as well! Lots to be thankful for this Thanksgiving~",

Not sure what they'll suggest yet. SO happy for you LC1975!  It is such a relief and takes awhile to wrap your brain back around to being ok.",

I think I succeed in putting it out of my mind because I'm so busy with my job(s) and then I dream about it, so I guess it's always in the back of my mind. I had a routine mammogram 8/15/11. Repeat mammo with magnified views 8/22/11: Cluster microcalcifications. Stereotactic core needle biopsy 9/1/11...missed the microcalcifications of concern. Consulted with a BS. Repeat stereotactic core needle biospy 10/18/11 at a different hospital. Much bruising and discomfort after the procedure. Results on 10/26/11:  atypical cells (did not get a copy of path report but suspect ADH). Scheduled for wire-guided excisional biopsy on 11/15 once the bruising resolves (3 months exacly from the date of the first abnormal mammo report). Past history 9 years ago of borderline ovarian cancer after a laparatomy and right ovary removal revealed a 7 cm tumor with borderline cancer cells. Repeat surgery 6 weeks later for a complete hysterectomy and have been on estrogen replacement ever since (age 41 at time of hysterectomy). It's been a long haul and am anxious to finally get an answer either way. I also am not relishing the idea of 6 month follow-ups and the thought of future biopsies as well. But I'll just take one step at a time.... hope you get good news soon~",

Sending you positive thoughts...must be hard dealing with this and taking care of 3 young children. My kids are all pretty much grown (18, 22, 25).  Well....good luck!
