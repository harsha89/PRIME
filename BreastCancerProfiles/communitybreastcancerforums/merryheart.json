I am getting out a bit more now and can now drive again as my arm/shoulder is getting more mobile. It all feels like a bad dream and how I wish I could just wake up out of it, but know I have to face the reality of it, day by day, hour by hour. I find the mornings are awful...the \"what ifs\" start as soon as I awaken. No, I do not know about ER..status as yet. So far, have not had my appointment to see oncologist.

      "Content": "Dec 4, 2009 04:37AM - edited Dec 4, 2009 04:42AM by merryheart Hi Everyone, feeling very vulnerable and shakey today after my appointment with the oncologist yesterday. She was very nice and supportive, but all the info and time spent there really was hard. Found out these facts:- Cancer was large 6cms. 11 our of 17 (total) lymph nodes cancerous It is a very high risk cancer!!! I am ER negative (so no tomixifen) I am Her or is it HR2? negative Grade 3 She would not commit to saying whether I was stage 3 or more. I have to have a scan to find out if the cancer has spread Highly recommended chemo to start January 4th for 6 sessions  every 3 weeks (not the 16 the consultant had said)  but this will not be the \"standard\" chemo. it is something called TAC using 3 drugs. Radiotherapy after the chemo ends. Steroids to take 3 days each 3 weeks - day before.on the day and day after. An injection from a nurse the day after for the bone marrow (?) Loads of information that made my head swim. But...she said that is the very best form of defence available to give me a chance. I feel sick and scared and the \"what ifs\" are out in force, but i hjave to do this. I signed the consent form. They were all so very kind and I saw the chemo nurse who showed me around and I was so moved to tears seeing lots of other people having their chemo, some in single rooms, others in groups, all looking \"normal\" and even talking and laughing together. I cannot ever imagine being like that!  I felt so sorry that so many people suffer with this. The nurse kept telling me I would be fine. She also said that American cancer treatments can be very different to those here in the UK, but you all seem to be so well informed and so very helpful, i don`t want to leave your forum.  I did look up the UK sites kindly given to me by gfrey...thankyou for that and all your wonderful helpful advise...I appreciate it. So, at least I have a month to try to build up my strength and try to come to terms. Any positive advise now you know my  assessment would be welcome, and once again, thank you all so very very much. I am feeling on edge today and even snapped at my dear friend who has so helped me through this...feel awful! Love and God bless you all, xxx",

Please know that you are helping very much with your positive outlooks and good reports.  I feel really weak and scared this morning...the battle is in the mind! I know i have to have a positive attitude, but its hard to find it right now. I am getting out a bit more and now my arm is more mobile, I can drive again. Walked along the beach yesterday wondering whether I would be walking it this time next year....still crying a lot with such a sadness. I believe in God, I speak out His Words, I pray yet I feel in such a lonely dark valley...this surely is what is meant by the shadow of the valley of death. But, these dark thoughts do pass (thank God). I am due to see my own GP this afternoon and will share what I am feeling. I am not sure of what questions I should be asking right now. One is about my apprehension of when I begin the chemo. I live alone (my sons live away...one in Australia) and my friend who is staying with me and helping after my op  won`t be able to be with me after the chemo  starts and from what I have heard/read, I am wondering if I can cope on my own? What do you think? Anyway, thank you each and every one for your loving help. may you be richly blessed. BTW...I forgot to add that the consultant told me there was a 1 inch clear margin which I assume is good??? Love and hugs xxxx",

Funnily enough, I do know Lytham St Annes quite well having lived near there as a child/teenager. Yes, it is lovely. I do so hope you are right and the scan will not show anything awful. That would be SUCH a relief! Just come back from shopping...found listening to Christmas Carols quite upsetting (brings back so many poignant memories) This will be the 2nd Christmas without my dear husband and what with this added problem, its no joke. My son is due to come for a visit next week for Christmas and I am so not wanting him to see me too upset over this. Plan on us going out a lot more for diversion...anything to just get throught this! Anyway, thanks again for replying to me. Love Merry x",

I try to put these thoughts out of my mind but its impossible. Its awful having this dark cloud hovering all the time over me. i know you have all had to go through this and so many of you are so encouraging...so I KNOW this is doable as you say. I pray for courage and peace. it is i think the uncertainty. if only someone could say to me \"when you have had all this then you will be guaranteed at least another 10 years or more\". Unrealistic I know.  I found out today also that I am IDC.  I gave myself the user name of merry heart because i know that a merry heart is like medicine and does good. I so need a more positive attitude.  I so miss my dear husband and dreamed of him the other night giving me a big hug and i felt he was saying its all alright. The weather is awful, its grey and rainy and I have to get myself focused on good positive things and give thanks for all the good that i do have in my life. This is the biggest trial ever....I just hope and pray that out of it some good will come and i can be of use to others. I know that God does not give us more than we can bear...I just really really need to believe it with all my heart and soul. He is a good God and loves us. This is such a test of faith. Its so easy to be thankful when everything is going good. sorry, I really have gone on! But thanks for being here and helping. I will be ok in a little while...I find mornings are worst. are there really people out there who have done this from the same high risk state as me and survived a good few years? this is what i need to really get deep inside of me, the knowledge that there really really is hope. I love my sons so much and do not want to leave here yet. Love to you all, xxx",

Well, I saw my Doctor yesterday (my regualr GP) he was quite encouraging and urged me to accept the chemo if it was recommended, and to ask questions as to the statistics. He also said (as he read off the screen) that it was a very common cancer and that maybe I could be treated with Tamoxifen and radiotherapy without any chemp. That made me feel more hopeful. But, like he said, I need the views of the Oncologist. The hospital rang me yesterday with a cancellation and have booked me to see a Dr Oncologist tomorrow at 2pm. The cancer-care nurse phoned later  and suggested I ask questions such as \"what would be the difference statistically if I did not have chemo and just had radiotherapy\" Would the benefits be the same? Has anyone else found this to be true? I suppose I really just have to wait until tomorrow to find out all the details. I will post back to you with those ER/PR size grade etc details. Will take a pen and paper with me and my friend. To Pure E...yes, I do belong to a supportive Church and there are a few there who are willing to help. You are so right about being with positive people...its amazing what negative things some people come out with, not realizing. Thanks for saying I shall be walking along that beach again next year...I needed to hear that! I am so glad you are doing so well and preggies too. Love and God bless to you all, xxx",
