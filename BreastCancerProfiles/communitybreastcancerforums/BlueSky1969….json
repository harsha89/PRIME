I've checked the site from time to time, and have meant to post, but...life - 2 teenage boys, family and friends, and trying to give myself space to heal. I find writing difficult, and tend to put it off for as long as possible. My surgery went well, my night in the hospital was awful, felt so much better to be home. I had a couple friends come over for the first 4 days and then was fine to be by myself w occasional help from boys. My head is still spinning from all of this. I haven't seen an oncologist yet and feel like my life is still suspended pending further treatment info. I'm hoping to have my Oncotype info by end of June - and then a plan. Still stumbling around in the dark though. I'm trying to go for long walks and listen to podcasts to keep my brain on track. Oprah's super soul Sunday series has been helpful: good, wise company for my walks. Sending love and light to all you out there, xo ",

I'm in Canada and while I'm grateful for the free access to health care I'm frustrated by the wait. I doubt I'll have my Oncotype results on Weds, and am grouchy about waiting another 3 weeks or so for the results. All this waiting is gruelling - turns out I am more of a control freak than I thought. Chalk it up to one of the many lessons in this experience. I've been pretty stoic about the whole 'thing' but my impatience gets the better of me. Was hoping to know next steps next week. If I'm getting chemo I want to plow through it like surgery. I hope others are finding some zen...",

      "Content": "Apr 28, 2018 07:39AM - edited Apr 28, 2018 10:52PM by BlueSky1969 Hi All; I'm sked'd for a R Mx with 2 stage reconstruction and a SNB on May 1st. It's been a gruelling wait for me which began Feb 28, 2018 w an abnormal mammogram. I had hoped (?) for a lumpectomy and some radiation, but have autoimmune issues that make radiation too risky. So: mx for me. I still feel unsettled w my decision to go for reconstruction: I'm a 48yo single mother of 2 teenage boys, and while the odds are against me, I would like to be in a relationship at some point. More importantly though, I imagine that looking at myself in the mirror w/o reconstruction would be a constant reminder and upsetting. I was always disappointed w my smaller breasts but wouldn't have undergone an augmentation. The decision to do so is such a 180 for me - but so was my diagnosis. My surgery is in Vancouver BC. I think I reached peak anxiety about it this Weds/Thurs. I now feel like I want to get if over with but I know I don't fully understand the emotional impact. And - desperatley want the waiting game to be over and to have my pathology results in hand to know what lays ahead. In Vancouver I'm told it's a 3 week wait. Tough for a small 'a' type A : ) Hope you are all patient with yourselves while healing - I wish you all the best outcomes and speedy, 'easy' recoveries.",

I too have caught a cold, and am blowing my nose very 5 minutes. I was told by surgeon that as long as I didn't have a fever I would be ok for my procedure on Tues - but that's up here in Canada. I had hoped for some quiet time before my Mx but, of course, I'm rushing to finish. I'll send you all my 'good outcome' vibes next Tues",
