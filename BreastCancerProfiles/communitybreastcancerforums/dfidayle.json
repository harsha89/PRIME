I not only lived in it after my mastectomy in 2007 but am posting this response from it right now while I recuperate from my reconstruction which was done on January 28th.Â  I would also recommend getting a body pillow (I got mine from bed/bath and beyond) to go with it. You can use half the body pillow under your legs and rest your surgical arm side on the other half. Good luck with your surgery!",

WRONG! My radiologist told me that only 7 to 8% of cancers are not detected by mammogram. Welcome to the 8%! I just had a lumpectomy with sentinal node dissection and the tumor they thought was 2.5 centimeters is actually 4.5 centimeters and now I am facing a mastectomy. With every turn there seems to be something else that is a surprise. Good luck to all and God bless.",
