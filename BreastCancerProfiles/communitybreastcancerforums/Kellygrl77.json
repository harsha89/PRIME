I loose weight for couple weeks (I tell my nurses that say they don't want you to loose weight like that that I do have plenty to spare than gain it back &trying then some but still really can't eat or make it stay) I did ok with baked potatoes for lil while. Don't care for sweets but a good chocolate malt helped when really bad than sometimes ensure (thought slim fast would have been better lol). Oily greasy foods are definatly out. Has been suggested to avoid metal utensils to avoid metal tastes & try ginger for nausea. A lot of things to me now taste like metal, grease, sour or bad or cause bad nausea heartburn etc.",

The first time I went out bald was kinda funny. My mom was out visiting & she rushed me out the door. We were laughing & talking than I reached up rubbed my head & gasped. I forgot my hat, I'm completely bald. Well I was just laughing & smiling & had only just noticed so why not just continue & just enjoy the day. Then something else kinda funny. Now days with people shaving thier heads just because, crazy colors, crazt styles you can just about blend right in. I met one woman & she said wow what made me decide to shave my head. I didn't know what to say \"ummm cancer\". She felt terrible, but we both laughed. So many women have just shaved their head just because. I have gotten used to seeing it as incredible strength. Always loved the movie gi jane. Did always have super long hair & somedays are hard, was even worse looking in the mirror seeing no eyebrows or eyelashes & couldn't put on makeup without being able to put on mascara which was even harder. It is slowly coming back & now just trying to keep my head warm. I think a bald head with a beautiful smile shows true strength more than an ugly sickness. Still have the wigs on standby for an occasion I can't go without. So far so good.",
