That was over a year ago and I've received clear mamos since then so if it is what I had ....that is the reason for the clip.   Obviously there are several different types of diagnosis...etc. so this just my experience.    Hope that helps some. I'm doing great now so they have come a long ways in treatments and such and I will be praying yours is benign and no more treatment necessary!",

      "Content": "Mar 28, 2010 09:35AM - edited Mar 28, 2010 09:37AM by ATeamNana So sorry you have to go thru this especially after dealing with recent illness and son's issues. I did the same regimen you will have 4 A/C followed by 12 Tax....although I was Triple Neg so they did my chemo first then lumpectomy...(It had a 93% growth rate) so the hope was to shrink tumor prior to surgery...which it did...praise the Lord.....I have had 18 radiation....15 to go.... I did fairly well through treatment no nauseau but I did get dry mouth and allergic reaction to the taxol but they gave me steroids / benedryl prior to infusion and that helped...so make sure you drink plenty of water....don't use regular toothpaste/mouthwash...any with alcholol...I used the benatine brand (spelling? and it helped a lot.....I am 55 ...I worked through my treatment full time ....It helped keep my mind off of it. I missed a few days here and there and 1/2 days on chemo days...I feel great now....so you CAN DO IT I know it will be hard....been there but try to keep a positive attitude....get plenty of rest.... This blog is a wonderful source of information & support. P.S.  I have about 1/2\" hair regrowth....if you get a chance go to one of the Feel Good Look Good clinics....they have great ideas regarding turbans...head covers....make up etc.and they give you some free products.....",
