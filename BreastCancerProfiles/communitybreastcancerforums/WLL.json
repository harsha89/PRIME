I have been trying to drink lots of water, but I have to have my tea also. They gave me Emend for three day, and also take Zofran for nasuea. This actually my 2nd chemo treatment--I have one treatment of TC but had a reaction to it, so they switched me to AC. I felt really good on TC, so I just hope I feel good on AC also. I have started losing my hair, just have not been able to shave it yet. I do have a wig I have been wearing to work and hat to wear just out. You are going to be fine, just take your nausea meds on schedule. I have been taking zofran every 12 hours, everyday. I have  had no problem with nausea. We can switch notes on SE. For me so far so good. The chemo sessions are actually relaxing, they give me something to relax me through my port and I sleep through most of it. The nurse did have me chew on ice when she was giving me the Adriamycin, she said it helped with something,  I cant remember what she said. Good-Luck it wont be as bad as you expect. If you ever need to talk you can PM me. Wendy",

So, my oncologist said I was a having a reaction to the taxotere, so I have to start on new chemo regieme--Adriamycin/Cytoxan x4 every three weeks and Taxol/Herceptin x 12 weekly and then radiation, continuing Herceptin for a year. It was 16 days after 1st treatment--hair began to start coming out--started wearing my wig--uncomfortable but doable. Having my 2nd treatment--starting AC--this Friday.

I am planning on having my treatments during my lunch hour, is that realistic? I have to do 6 1/2 weeks of radiation. I did read a blog about her experience of radiation. This is what she did---she applied Medline's remedy skin repair cream in mornings, She applies Boiron Calendula cream right after treatment, when she got home she would apply Lily of desert's 100% aloe vera gel, and before she went to bed she would apply aloe vera gel and Boiron calendula oil. She also took L-Glutamine and Vit-D.  She said the Dr. said her skin looked great for going through radiation. So I plan to do the same regime. Good- luck to all and God Bless    Wendy",
