She has had 6 rounds of chemo. She also had a baseline bone scan before treatment, which showed hot spots on lung, ribs and skull. The only one which is readily explained is on the lung because she had pnuemonia last year. No injuries to ribs or skull as far as we know. Chemo has been spectacularly successful, no tumour left however subsequent bone scan has showed that the hot spots have disappeared.  Does anyone have any evidence that this could be coincidental? ie. that the hot spots were random injuries that just happened to have disappeared over the course of time or due to the chemo but weren't mets?  Or evidence to the contrary - that the disappearance of hot spots after chemo means it likely that it was mets?  Again I stress that I realise that there are no certainties but would be so happy to hear of other experience. thanks so much s xx  Log in to post a reply",
