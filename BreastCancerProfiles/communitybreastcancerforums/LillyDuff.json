I wished I found this site before my cancer diagnosis. The following is my personal experience with a fibroadenoma diagnosis and also just my personal opinions. Early detection with mammography failed me in 2016 as I had dense breasts and a presumed \"fibroadenoma\" per ultrasound (my request) where no biopsy was recommended at the time. I went another year for that \"yearly mammogram\" and still nothing showed up. My doctor didn't feel the need to order another ultrasound the next year and told me that clinical exam felt normal. (I should have pushed for another ultrasound. I just didn't know...) My bouncy lumpy fibroadenoma changed one day to a rock hard lump five months after my last \"normal\" mammogram. During my biopsy, finally, when I knew in my heart it had to be cancer, the Radiologist kind of mumbled on her way out of the room that \"maybe we should have biopsied that last time.\"(14 months earlier) The worst thing to hear while on the table facing a cancer diagnosis. Even the day of my biopsy when the clip was placed in the area of concern via ultrasound, the unilateral mammogram to confirm the clip placement etc.STILL did not show the tumor!!!! It's like it was invisible in mammography but did visualize in ultrasound.Then the MRI I had after biopsy to determine extent of disease not only showed the tumor, but numerous satellite lesions. It looked like fireworks went off in my breast!!! I had no idea that was the case and mammography showed NOTHING!!!! The Radiologist mentioned that she couldn't dictate the mammogram during biopsy as normal because at that point, we knew where the lump was, so she had to leave the mammography report as \"incomplete\" BI-RADS 0 needed ultrasound to confirm, which the biopsy was via ultrasound. That was her way around the reading. So, who knows how long my tumor(s) were brewing in me? I never missed a mammogram appointment and had them each year on my dense breasts! Each year, my report was normal, but did mention dense breast tissue but did not recommend more imaging just mentioned follow up with clinical exams and yearly mammography. That's it. Would it be too much for the Radiologists to add one extra sentence on a report to recommend additional imaging due to dense breast tissue? I know that is the case now in some states but not all. This seriously needs to change and I'm surprised it's still not a requirement in all states. So very sad! How many patients fall through the cracks? (Please take note, ladies!!!) Needless to say, if I could turn back time, I would have demanded an ultrasound with each mammogram due to my dense breast tissue. I just didn't know to keep asking for it. I would have paid cash for an ultrasound as well!!!! My dense breasts were a hassle all my life and I always wondered if those lumps would turn out to be a problem. Sure enough, they were ticking time bombs.No history of BC in my family. No risk factors other than dense breast tissue. My genetic screening was clean. All normal. Now, I have to live with worrying about a recurrence. Not fun. :(",
