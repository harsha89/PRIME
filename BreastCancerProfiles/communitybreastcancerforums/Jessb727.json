Two days my 3/2 Taxol infusion, I started having chills (didn\u2019t experience this after the 2/23 infusion). I checked my temp and it was normal, but was also taking ibuprofen for the bone pain/aches. The chills persisted for two days but no fever, then I spiked a fever of 100.5. I called the on call and they told me to come in. I\u2019ve been admitted since then (three days ago), but the docs can\u2019t figure out what\u2019s causing the fever, which hasnt gone down without the help of Tylenol, and has gone as high as 101.5. They have me on a broad spectrum antibiotic but I still have the fever. I only have fever and chills - there are no localized symptoms indicating where an infection would be. They have done cultures and other tests and so far none have shown anything. Has anyone else experienced anything like this?It\u2019s frustrating being here without any progress so any thoughts/experiences would be appreciated!

It turns out mine was more than just a fever - it was pneumonitis caused by Taxol. Here\u2019s a summary of what happened for those who are experiencing something similar now or in the future. I had a lot of blood cultures (from arms and port) urine cultures, vaginal cultures, flu exam, and a viral blood work up that all came back negative. They also started me on two broad spectrum antibiotics that I did not respond to. Then they decided to do a CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis to see if they could pin point something because the fevers kept coming back. They saw \u201cground glass opacities\u201d on my lungs and I had a bronchoscopy to confirm inflammation not infection. All cultures from the bronchoscopy came back negative, and I was given steroids which I finally responded to. I didnt have any lung symptoms upon admission and only later in my stay started getting a very mild dry cough. Problem is now my MO and pulmonologist say it\u2019s too dangerous to continue the Taxol. My MO is going to look into whether starting Taxotere may be an option, but it could be taxanes in general that are causing the inflammation in my lungs. So I\u2019m nervous about the impact of pausing/stopping treatment, but definitely glad to be home from the hospital and that my condition didn\u2019t worsen before we figured it out (apparently some folks end up in ICU or worse with this).
