The WORST part of my experience was at the very beginning when everything was a big terrifying unknown: just prior to official diagnosis and also right afterward when I spent weeks with no treatment plan yet in place (I spent about a month seeking second opinions on treatment and surgical options).  I spent a lot of time hiding from the world, crying at the drop of a hat, barely eating and I got terrible stress-related back pain.  It was an awful and helpless time for me. As soon as we knew that surgery was definitely the first step, we told our young kids that \"mommy has something inside her body that could make her sick and the doctors say they can do an operation to try to get it all out.\"  I HAD to know with certainty what would be happening before telling them bc if I were dealing with neoadjuvant chemo it would have been a very different discussion.  I can tell you that once I had more certainty about the treatment plan, I felt more focused and ready to face it all.  Now that surgery is behind me (double mastectomy with DIEP recon), I will be moving on to the chemo stage soon.  It's still very scary but I'm proud to have gotten through surgery and I'm ready to keep fighting this beast.  You WILL get there, I know it...the early days are truly the hardest part.  I could go on and on, but this at least hits on the experience I've had so far and I hope it helps you in some small way.
