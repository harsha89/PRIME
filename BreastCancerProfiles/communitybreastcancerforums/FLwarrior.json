Yeah! My surgery on Tuesday went very well. UMX with SNB, no recon.  Good news on the nodes showed negative, but you know the drill waiting on pathology report for final word. I went home at noon on Wednesday.  The home health care nurse stopped by yesterday, today and will continue to come by the next 3 days.  The first night I slept propped up on a wedge and pillows.  Last night I was able to lay down in bed.  I slept well both nights.  I have 2 drains. One drain fills more than the other, but I have a low overall volume yesterday it was just 55ml both drains combined. I have the camisole and find it useful.  I did try the idea posted on here about running a piece of ribbon through the drain tabs and hanging it around my neck for showering...worked like a charm.  My pain level is tolerable with the pain meds. I am doing my exercises, but I find that it is helpful to do them 30 minutes or so after taking pain meds.  My mom is here helping me and it is very appreciated! LulyH, best wishes to you today for your procedure.  Sending you healing vibes and (hugs)!",

Sarasowise ~ I had a port for chemo and it was very helpful for easy access during treatment.  The chemo drugs are so strong that it is not good to have them just use IV access because it will collapse the veins.  My port was never painful.  My biggest gripes were the physical limitations. I was told by the BS, who put it in, I could not lift anything heavy, do any repetitive motion activities (I'm a kayaker...not this spring and summer ) and it interfered with yoga (no inverted poses, planks or push ups). Even with the irritating limitations, the port was good thing to have and I had no trouble with it.",

She told me that lightly massaging the scar area daily would help with the nerve sensitivity. Kelli are you going to get PT? I also had the issues with my arm from SNB you describe.

I have been very busy tying up loose ends getting ready for Tuesday.  I am really ready to get the surgery behind me and begin healing.  I am not as nervous about the procedure as I probably should be.  I went to surg tech school several years ago and during my clinicals my favorite Dr. to scrub in with happened to be a breast surgeon.  When I found my lump I called her office and got hooked up with the network of Drs she works with because I knew if I had to have surgery I would want her to be my surgeon. She is awesome.  I am grateful to have scrubbed in the OR with the Dr that will be performing my surgery.  It helps me feel less anxious.  I am dreading the hospital stay more than anything...even though it is only 1 night.",

I had to constantly eat cold foods to try to sooth it.  The magic mouthwash did not work for me.  I found salt water and baking soda rinse worked better for me than the biotene. It took 2 rounds of Fluconozole (the generic of diflucan) and a strict diet to get it under control.  I did a lot of reading about foods to avoid: sugar, dairy, cheese, vinegar, tomatoes, citrus and spicy foods. Sugar, dairy and cheese act as fuel for the thrush.  Tomatoes, citrus and vinegar are bad for the irritation in the GI tract. I ate yogurt everyday trying to get the good bacteria back in my gut, but it wasn't enough.  I started taking a milk free probiotic acidophilus plus FOS with L.Bulgaricus and Bifidus supplement and it helped a lot.  (must be refrigerated) One of the ladies here told me about it.  I have the capsules and I still take one everyday.  If I have a flare up, I open the capsule and pour the powder directly on my tongue for more direct contact.  I hope that you both feel better very soon!",

Several Rx were prescribed that did not help at all. Third try...My onc prescribed a round of antifungal meds which helped some, but 2 weeks later it flared up again, had to take another round of antifungals. It got better but was not completely healed.  I was eating yogurt with live cultures every single morning trying to balance my system, but that was not enough.  I bought probiotics in capsule form (that was suggested by one of the ladies here) and I take one of those every morning, which seems to help the most. Rabbit, I hope that you get to SKIP this SE. I made it all the way through the treatments without developing neuropathy.  3 weeks after treatment I had a post-treatment MUGA and MRI. The morning after the MRI (with contrast) the pins and needles sensations started in my feet.  That sensation has subsided, but I still have a lot of sensitivity and pain in my feet.  My hands are heat and cold sensitive. I took L-Glutamine on infusion days (so, it didn't work for me)...Onc says to try continuing taking it once a week in addition to everything else I already take daily to try to combat the neuropathy to see if it will help. I also take B-complex, B-6, L-Theanine and a multivitamin. My onc has suggested several times to try low-dose anti-depressants for the neuropathy pain, but I do not want to go down that road.  I am trying to find more natural way to get through this.  Any suggestions...would be welcome. I have always been very active and healthy, so the foot thing is really a challenge.  On the up side...I had nail changes, but I did not loose any.  I didn't hear about ice bags for the nails until I was finished with treatment.  I have an indentation that runs from side to side on each nail that is chemo induced, but no lifting and no pain.  Several of the ridges have already grown out and been cut off. I wish you well and hope you breeze through taxotere!  Onc and nurses all told me taxotere was supposed to be way easier than FEC, I hope you find that to be true!",

Everyone agreed that I should go on medical leave, so that is what I did.  1 day before my leave started my manager told me that they would only be able to hold my position for 5 weeks.  WTH?  Chemo was going to be 20+ weeks!  Then recovery and then surgery then more recovery!  At 5 weeks they posted my position and filled it.   They transferred me to a \"holding\" cost center, so that I could remain an employee and retain my benefits. I found out a few days before my surgery that I was going to be \"separated\" in other words terminated 10 days after surgery because the allotted time the hospital allowed for leave had expired.  I am absolutely in disbelief about the situation!  I am still unemployed and diligently looking for a new job, but I am not having any luck.  I also lost my health insurance, so I am not able to go to the follow-up MO appointments. It is so stressing.  I am single and I have exhausted all my resources and I am not going to be able to pay my rent in Dec. I tell you all this, so that you can know some important things to find out if you should decide to take a medical leave. BC has really CHANGED my life!!!! Good luck to you! Edited for typos...",

I had UMX w/ SNB no recon last week.  I will be going for a prosthetic fitting in a cople of weeks.  I don't know anything about them. I imagine that I will go bare at home but want some shape for work and being out of the house. Looking for advice, ideas, suggestions and what questions to ask at the fitting. From your experience what works and what doesn't??? How will I know which kind of bra to choose?  Any feedback will be appreciated.",

Something that has been very confusing for me is...the skin adhering to chest wall...idea.  So many ladies have referred to this.  I thought that it was better for the skin to move freely and not adhere to the chest wall, so I asked my OT about it on Friday.  She confirmed that freely moving was the goal.  In fact I have one small area of adhesion and we are working to break it free.  Am I missing something here?",

In the end...There was just nothing that could convince me to endure all the trauma and pain to my body to under go the reconstruction.  In many cases the final results are very disappointing.  I have had more than one woman tell me that if she knew then what she knows now, she wouldn't reconstruct. The possibility of what it might or might not look like would have really stressed me out.  I worked in cardiology and did EKGs prior to bc and I cannot tell you how many \"bad\" boob jobs I've seen. I also spent time in the OR and have seen thee goop spooned out of women whose implants ruptured.  I also saw lots of flat women who made the choice to stay flat.  There are more of \"us\" out there than you realize. I will say that I echo the things Grenfrog and Pip57 mentioned.  Also the lymphedema issue that Linda KR brought up. Some women go flat no bra and love it.  I go bra-less and flat at home, but I wear bras with forms when I go out or to work.  Only a handful of people know about my bc, but again, that is my choice and I like to keep it that way. It is a very personal decision.  I don't have a problem with those who decide to reconstruct, it just wasn't the right thing for me personally. engk, don't let anyone pressure you into something you don't want.  It is you that will have to live with the consequences.  Do your research and then do what you believe in your heart is the right thing for you. Best wishes to you as you make your decisions.",
