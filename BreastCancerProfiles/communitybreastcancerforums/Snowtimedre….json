I can certainly understand your trepidation and concern given your previous Hodgkins lymphoma as well as your doctors approach. I am pleased that he is being thorough in his reveiws and his request for scans. I am not sure if you know that most cysts will flare prior to your period simply due to hormonal influences and settle down post period. I trust that this will happen for you and thats all there is to it.Â  Also I had my scan done on a Friday morning and went back late Friday afternoon to collect the report. I couldn't wait for the report so of course I looked and went to my doctor directly! You could phone and ask when the report will be ready and go back and collect it if you like. Please keep us posted. Regards Y",

From a lot of reading most cysts are generally benign by nature. Did the ultrasound report simply note that they were there and were they reported as normal? Regards Y",
