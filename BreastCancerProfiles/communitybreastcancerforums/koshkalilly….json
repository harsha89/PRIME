He felt the lump too and sent me to do a diagnostic mammogram which I had a couple of days ago. After the mammogram the technician said that no ultrasound is needed and I can go home. I am still waiting for mammo results and am a bit worried but surely 'no ultrasound needed' is a good sign, right? Log in to post a reply",

Just undergone mammo a couple of days ago - 8 pictures for my left breast and 2 for my right. That's all. Still waiting for mammo results. GP office said that if results are good they won't even call me. I'll call them myself in a week or so, of course... I just hope that the fact that I haven't been called to have an ultrasound after a mammo is a good sign... The waiting and guessing game sucks... I'm trying to calm down and get my normal life back and I can't.",
