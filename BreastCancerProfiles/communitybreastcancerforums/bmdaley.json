Or its the old line of if things are screwed up you can either be positive or be negative so why not be positive. Somehow I feel that all of us are truly complex individuals and that there's no black and white when it comes to how we feel. I feel almost assaulted in a way when told by someone that I should take antidepressants for expressing a negative feeling. Those negative feelings are very real, just as real as the positive ones. Denying them seems like a waste of energy that I don't have. Thank goodness we can just talk about these things here.",

I am on a three week cycle, the first week is Abraxane, Carbo, and Zometa, the second week is Abraxane and Herceptin. The first treatment I got was with both Abraxane and Carbo and it killed me. I've noticed for me and my doc agreed that the first time getting a chemo can be really hard but after that the body adjusts. Since then though, I can tell you that the Carbo Abraxane combination for me has been much harder than just Abraxane. In particular, on my two chemo week, I've had to get all the big guns to deal with nausea. I get a prescription called Emend which helps and I've also gotten additional steroid pills. The normal nausea drugs did not cut it. Also, I'm totally decked for the whole week following Carbo Abraxane whereas with the Abraxane I'm much more functioning. On the good news side though, my cancer cell counts were way down following just two cycles so the combination is working very well. I sincerely hope the pain you have been experiencing subsides or can be managed better. And, as a mom, my heart goes out to you. I wish I lived close by to help you out. I know how frustrating it is to feel unable to take care of the little ones we love so much. Big hugs.",

There's been some research studies, esp. recently showing that cancer cells had evolved in a way to elude detection by the immune system. So, no matter how good the immune system was, the cancer sneaks by. I think it is so important for all of us to know that it is not our fault that we have this disease. There are so many reasons people look to as possible causes but none of them have been proven yet. I guess all we can do is pray that the doctors figure it out soon for us. I can totally relate to your frustration Member as I have felt quite a bit that people sometimes want to believe that they know the cause of cancer so they won't get it themselves. Having stage IV is almost like living a Seinfeld episode every day because there are a lot of people who are so scared of what we are going through and can be so inappropriate.

GOOD LUCK  Estrogen for Hormone-Positive Metastatic Disease A Single Arm Phase II Study of Pharmacologic Dose Estrogen in Postmenopausal Women With Hormone Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer After Failure of Sequential Endocrine Therapies (W81XWH-06-029) Breast cancer tumors that are hormone sensitive -- estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and/or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive -- may eventually stop responding to hormone therapies, like tamoxifen and anastrazole (Arimidex®). Before hormone therapies that keep estrogen from getting to the breast tumor were developed, post-menopausal women with metastatic breast cancer were often treated with estrogen. Recent studies have found that post-menopausal women with hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer that has stopped responding to hormone therapies did respond to estrogen. The purpose of this trial is to determine whether the estrogen estradiol (Estrace) can shrink breast cancer and/or get the tumor to start responding again to hormone therapies. This is a Phase II trial",

I'm glad I did because I don't feel as well right now and don't feel I can enjoy travel as much as I did when I was better. I also spent a lot of time checking out complementary/alternative medecine and ultimately concluded that none of it can cure cancer but it can strengthen your body to withstand the awful treatments, which is so important when you want to be able to do every treatment possible. I wish you much luck and hope you are finding that all the wise women here have some good thoughts for you.",

The new protocol seems to be working much better. The only serious side effect I've had has been just being tired and also a bit more emotionally drained. Also, hair falling out.

After initial results showing Avastin and Tamoxifen was working, they actually made my cancer grow very aggressively. By the time we figured that out and got me off, I was angling to get into the TDM1 study. I couldn't wait for all the shipping of lab samples and got myself onto Gemzar which appears to be working, although slowly. The cancer has caused me to have a paralyzed vocal chord, gastroparesis (stomach fails to empty food to intestine), and a weak bladder which fails to empty. My pleural effusions are back and I'm hacking away. My pulmonologist finally decided I could get the VATS surgery which adheres the lung to the chest wall and prevents pleural effusions. I begged him to do the surgery on me three months ago when I was in good shape. Now I'm a frickin mess and don't know when I'll be able to get that surgery and get rid of this cough. All this has resulted in family and friends rallying around. Thanks to Heidi Ho, my friends set up a Lots of Helping Hands website (www.lotsahelpinghands.com/c/61... THANK YOU Heidi. So now everyone driving me around to doc appts etc. Despite my crosses to bear I see so many postings here of women facing daunting challenges and feel humbled by their courage (esp Heidi and riverinrabbit).

I reviewed the rules and found that metastaic breast cancer is a category which gets approved. I was approved in a matter of weeks. However, I made sure to prepare my application very thoroughly with all medical and employment records so they didn't need to do much to fast track my application. I was told that because my application was so thorough that the employees at Social Security headquarters would probably want to work on my application and get it done because it was an easy one. From what I gather, a lot of this just depends who you get at Social Security to help you. I was as nice and helpful as could be and it got me far. You should check the rules but you may be able to get back benefits if you have not been working for a long time. The Social Security disability website is very thorough and should be a helpful reference for you. At the same time that they work on your SSD application, they may also review you for SS Suplemental and determine if your income qualifies you for that benefit. If you have children under the age of 18 and you are approved for SSD, they will also be eligible to receive income. Once you are approved, you simply go back to your contact at the Social Security office and apply for dependents. I sincerely hope you are able to get what you need and deserve through this process.",

Garber, MD, MPH; Donna Deegan; Bruce Feiler Join Living Beyond Breast Cancer on May 1-2 in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, for our 4th Annual Conference for Women Living with Advanced Breast Cancer. Held just miles from the city at the beautiful Philadelphia Marriott West Hotel, this national conference focuses on your unique concerns as a woman living with metastatic breast cancer. At this event, you will: Learn about medical treatments for bone, liver, lung and brain mets Hear about clinical trials and cutting-edge therapies Ask questions of providers with a special interest in metastatic breast cancer Get advice on managing side effects Find support for your emotional and practical concerns Be inspired by speakers who have coped with metastatic cancers Connect with hundreds of women like you During three plenary sessions and ten workshops (detailed below), get the information and support you need to make informed decisions. You\u2019ll also enjoy a special screening of LBBC\u2019s video Metastatic Breast Cancer: Stories of Trials, Perseverance and Hope; conversations with providers; and networking receptions, where you\u2019ll connect with women and families. We hope you\u2019ll make some friends along the way, too! About Our Key Speakers Judy E. Garber, MD, MPH, Bruce Feiler and Donna Deegan, our plenary speakers, are leading voices in the world of metastatic cancer. During the opening plenary session on Saturday, Dr. Garber will discuss \"Treating Advanced Breast Cancer: Medical and Research News.\" A member of LBBC\u2019s Medical Advisory Board, Dr. Garber is director of the cancer risk and prevention program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, in Boston. She also serves as attending physician at Dana-Farber\u2019s Breast Evaluation Center and is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Her research interests include hereditary and familial breast cancers, novel medicines, managing chemotherapy side effects and cancers in premenopausal women. A New York Times best-selling author, Mr. Feiler will open the second plenary session on Saturday afternoon by discussing how he coped with his 2008 diagnosis of bone cancer. The experience inspired his book, The Council of Dads: My Daughters, My Illness and the Men Who Could Be Me, which will be released just a week before the conference. The book explores how he prepared for the possibility his children could grow up without him. Previously, Mr. Feiler published nine books that reexamine historical people and places. Ms. Deegan, also speaking during the second plenary, is the evening anchor for \"First Coast News\" in Jacksonville, Florida. She will share her inspiring journey of thriving while managing breast cancer. After her initial diagnosis, Ms. Deegan established The Donna Foundation, which helps women in northern Florida who are undergoing breast cancer treatment and have financial difficulties. She established an annual race called 26.2 with Donna: The National Marathon to Fight Breast Cancer. All proceeds support breast cancer research and support. Ms. Deegan has published two books about her journey with breast cancer, The Good Fight and Through Rose Colored Glasses. During plenary session three on Sunday, you can directly question our five professionals with expertise in the concerns of women with metastatic breast cancers.

Part of my lungs were collapsing too from the fluid. A CT/Petscan scan was not very conclusive. We only knew definitively that it was the cancer after I had fluid drained from the site (a procedure called a thoracentesis which they did at the hospital) and sent out for pathology. I've had the area around my lungs drained several times and this provided relief and helped the coughing to go away while the chemo and other drugs have a chance to do their work. I sincerely hope this is not what is happening to you but just in case, I thought you should know.",

Also, it may helpful for you to get hold of all of her medical records so that you can review them. I also have found it so helpful to get second opinion from other oncologists because I learn so much. Bring those records to the other doctor to review. Also, try not to worry about the spot. I know that's hard to do. I had a spot in my lung which ultimately turned out to be nothing. Apparently its common to have little spots of muck in the lungs which are perfectly harmless. Your doctor should be able to help you figure out how to monitor the spot to determine whether cancer or not. Big hugs to you for being such a wonderful daughter and helping your mom face the morass they call the medical system. If you ever want to talk, send me a PM and I'll be happy to give you my phone#. If your doc is taking your mom off Xeloda and putting her on Arimidex, it may actually be a sign that the chemo was effective and he feels she no longer needs to take the chemo. Good luck!",

Navelbine was nice because it didn't cause hair to fall out and seemed to not be as harsh as other chemos. Now I'm on Carboplatin & Abraxane, Herceptin & Zometa. It's a rougher treatment plan but has been very effective. After two cycles my cancer counts were back down to \"manageable.\" I remember what a shock it was to hear about my scan with cancer in the liver, bones, vertebrae. I was sort of depressed about it for a while but that got better. Hope you are able to cope with your treatments and get better soon.",

I also have stage IV, it is or has been in my liver, bones and various other places. I have estrogen receptive cancer which is HER2 positive and am pre-menopausal so my situation may not be a useful comparison to your mom's, but I'll tell you what my doc did. He started me on Navelbine once I was metastatic which was a fairly easy chemotherapy (along with Herceptin & Zometa). I used it for 9-10 months and it was nice because it did not make my hair fall out and was fairly gentle as chemotherapies go. I am now on Abraxane. I had tried Carboplatin and Abraxane for a while but it was too rough and I landed in the hospital with problems too. The Abraxane is rougher than Navelbine, but manageable. Good luck. Your mom is so lucky to have a loving caregiver. I hope she feels better soon.",

As far as encouraging news, the opening session really offered a lot of information about new treatments being tested but it was fast moving and full of medical jargon. There was no handout unfortunately and I had a difficult time just scribbling down the names of the drugs into a list. The organization was recording the conference so I will let you all know if they post those recordings. Living Beyond Breast Cancer is having a teleconference in June on the ASCO meetings where I imagine a lot of the same information will be covered.
