Now i have a deep dent on the under side of the same breast along with discharge and a flaky sore thats been there for a month. The breast also hangs about an inch lower than the other. Ill be going to a breast clinic next week and im curious as to what tests the doctor may want to do based on these symptoms? Log in to post a reply",
