My mum was diagnosed with Breast CA on 8 May 2009. I felt like the entire sky collapsed on me! I have to be very strong for my mum, dad and siblings. She went for mastectomy on 20 May 2009 removed her right breast and axillary lymph nodes. She also went for chemo port insertion on 18 June 2009. She will be going for her 1st chemo session on 26 June 2009. I really need your kind assistance in providing info on how she should prepare herself for the chemo session. And questions that we need to ask the oncologist. Please help me on this. Thank you  Regards  Amuta Log in to post a reply",
