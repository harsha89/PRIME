In January I had the all the ducts in my right breast removed after finding a lump and experiencing some nipple discharge. The pathology results were benign (YAY), however my wound did not heal well and I developed an abscess which in my opinion was really poorly treated by my surgeon. I saw her multiple times because it was visibly getting worse before I ended up being admitted to hospital because I went to A&E. The same surgeon had me on Iv antibiotics and during my stay the abscess self drained. At that time I asked to see a different doctor, but I could not because I do not have private health insurance. After that the wound closed and then opened and the closed about 4 times. I saw my gp and she took swabs, all of them coming back negative for any bacteria. She did prescribe antibiotics whilst waiting for the results. For the last month and a half the wound has been closed, however it has become red and sore and somewhat lumpy again.the ultrasound I had today (or what I understood form the tech) said I have another abscess. I really don't quite know what to do as I am really unhappy with the way my surgeon treated me the first time, but living in Australia, the closest decent surgeon is about 400km away. Does anyone have any advise about what might be going on? Thank you and sorry for the ramble Kelly Log in to post a reply",
