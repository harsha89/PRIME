      "Content": "minx wrote: I had an \"unusual\" mammogram about 2 weeks ago.  Went back late last week for a follow-up and ultrasound.  The radiologist says \"there's something there but they're not sure what\".  I'm scheduled for a biopsy on Friday. I think one of the things that's driving me INSANE while I wait is the feeling/worries that I can \"feel\" the breast cancer.  That is, every twinge, every ache....my left breast has been \"bugging\" me ever since they told me that whatever \"it\" is, it's in my left breast.  And every now and then I feel queasy....cancer? And on the one hand, I want to talk about it with friends but on the other, I don't want to tell anyone because it makes it more real/important than I'm ready to deal with.  And I'm not sure people who haven't been in this spot can really understand or help.  God knows in hindsight, I haven't been helpful with women I've known who have battled b.c. I'm going to go look around the forum and try to educate myself--there's so much I don't know.  For example, I felt some relief that what I saw on the mammo and ultrasound looked tiny but I don't know if that really means anything...? Anyway, I'll poke around.  Bless you all. Log in to post a reply",

Regardless, this has been a life changing time for me.  I was so ready for it to go the other way and I know that happens for countless women DAILY.  I'm not sure how but I want to do something for other people that are really battling this disease (or cancer in any form).  Hugs to all of you and especially you ladies that have walked that road and are here for people like me who might/might not experience that.  Thank you.  I hope I can find a way to give.",
