I love being a nurse but was suprised to find out how ignorant I was about breast cancer. I was diagnosed in May of 2007. Have to read alot and use the internet.One of my coworkers, a respiratory therapist, is a 5 year survivor and she has been a breast source of knowledge and support to me Thank goodness for this website. I have learned so many \"little things\" Your realize you are not the only one concerned with the things your health care providers probably don't even know about. I have just recently finished phase 2 of DIEP reconstruction on my left breast. My employer and coworkers have been incredible.",
