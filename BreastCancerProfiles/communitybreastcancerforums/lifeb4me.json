They have helped me a lot and I reckon it's time to pay back forward. I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on Wednesday, March 8th. All went well, my nodes were negative and today I will be able to remove the dressings and have a real shower. MariH - I did not have a drain for the SNB. My BS said drain only with full axillary clearance. It was easier than I imagined. I used numbing cream on my areola for the injection and also on my tumor for the wire and it was not too bad.",

It's called frozen section and it's 96% accurate. If they are positive, that's it, but if they are negative they are reexamined with the traditional methods after surgery with the removed tumor to check for clear margins. So I'm hoping it won't be a false negative! The confirmed results should come out next week.",

I'm using Tylenol extra strength during the day and the percocet at night, to ensure a good nights sleep as it makes me very sleepy. Today I noticed a sloshing sound in my breast and was a bit scared I would need drainage, but read in some other treads that it is common and nothing needs to be done as the body will absorb the extra liquid over time. It's because the body does not like empty spaces and fills the cavity where the breast tissue was removed with liquid. Just letting you know if it happens with someone else there is no need to panic. I got some nice button up shirts at JC Penny on clearance for about 12 dollars each and a hoodie for 8 dollars. They are soft and are serving me well. Sitti - thank you for the list. It's amazing how many of us there are : ( Yvonne - Congratulations on the hair wash. It really lifts our spirits to feel clean. plantchild - hope you are felling better and that your fever goes away. I would call, the surgeon about it, just to be on the safe side. Mari H and Grendel - hoping the weather won't impact your surgeries. In your pocket tomorrow. Let us know when you can how it went. DIV - will have you in my prayers for a clean scan.  ",

Next week follow up with BS on Tuesday, MO and Herceptin on Wednesday. Next step rads. I'm thinking they will set it up next week. DiV - great news on PET scan. Praying for you. Bareclaws - Glad everything went well and you have minimal pain. LaisSS - Congrats on the on the negative nodes and margins. GrendelDog and MariH - hope you're home and healing from your surgeries.

I did not know at the time you can lobby to have it implanted in a non visible area and that it could be done eith a vertical incision that could be hidden under the bra. I only found this out from a post here from a doctor that explained it. Unfortunately it was too late for me. I have a hideous scar that can be seen very easily. I\u2019ve had to change many blouses and dtess s from my wardrobe. I also have a nick/depression/hole, kind of like a dimple on my collR bone that there\u2019s no hiding. Although my port didn\u2019t actively hurt after the first week or so, it bothered me all the time and depending on the position I tried to sleep in, it hurt. I had it removed , by a plastic surgeon to try and make the scar better, a couple of weeks after my last chemo. Most port scars I\u2019ve seen are horrible and deep/depressed and I wanted to try to avoid it. I\u2019ve had some fat grafting but I\u2019m still not entirely happy with it. If I knew then what I know now I would have refused it or made sure it was hidden. Good luck.",

I have had a lumpectomy with SNB on Wednesday and all went well. I want to thank you all for sharing you experiences here because it really helped me know what to expect and what to ask my BS. I feel a bit selfish that I didn't post before but I wasn't able to emotionally. I'm sorry. I'm a big hermit when I'm hurting, I'm like a wounded animal. I hope I can can make up for it in some way now I'm here. I've had neoadjuvant chemo so maybe my experience can help those who are on the chemo train. ",

Waiting is one of the worst parts of all this ordeal. Annoyingboob - wish you good nights sleep without SEs and no sugar cravings. Don't be jealous of us chemo ladies, it's just as bad. You know it tastes good (like chocolate) and you remember how much you like it but your pleasure is ruined by the penny taste. Sad, very sad... Dcbc - I don't sleep well either since this all began. I make do with homeopathic and natural remedies, passion fruit juice and when I'm desperate a zyquil (which I'm told has benadryl). Wish weed was legal here. Even for the nausea I only got the synthetic version Marinol, which, by the way, was the only thing that worked for me during chemo. Wish I had had the real deal! Vargadoll - your granddaughter is such a cutie, love her bow, hope she's all better now. I'm 5 days post lumpectomy and SNB and can hear water sloshing in my operated breast. It's not painful or swollen but sure is weird. Anyone had that?",
