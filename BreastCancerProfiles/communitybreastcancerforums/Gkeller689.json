I found a very tiny bump above my nipple after experiencing a sharp stinging pain in my left breast. I had noticed this 2 months prior and had it checked by my ob/gyn. She advised it could be hormonal and to wait till after my period. While waiting for my period to come and go I noticed a green discharge only when I squeeze that nipple. The tiny bump did not go away so I followed up with an u/s. the tech said she didn't find anything, not even a cyst. Is it normal to have discharge from one breast? It only appears when I squeeze the actual nipple, but I also have terrible stinging pain in this nipple. Should I call the dr. again? I feel silly that I didn't mention the discharge before, but I wasn't really squeezing my breast before I found the lump either! Please help, I need advice! Log in to post a reply",

I thought I had an indent this morning. There is about a 1/4\" divet directly under my nipple, which coincidently is the same one that has discharge and the same breast that I felt a lump in. I have seen the blue vein many times on myself, but I think it comes and goes every month with my cycle. I don't know what to think anymore. Every little thing I see screams \"cancer\" to me. I just want to say hang in there. Don't feel like you can't express your rants and fears here, because I feel the same and it comforts me to know that it's common among those waiting for a diagnosis. Keep your head up! Best wishes!!",

Good luck tomorrow, I'm sure you are in good hands. Please let us know how it went, I'm very curious to know what it's like. Maybe you could help calm my fears too.",
