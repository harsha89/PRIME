But she couldn't see anything on the screen.  She said since I was 29 getting a mammogram wouldn't give much benefit and says just watch it over the next couple of months for changes.  My grandmother (moms side) died from breast cancer in 1994 and my aunt had cervical cancer in her early 20's mom side too.  I'm worried.  What should I do? Leave it be as it is? She said it could just be a bump I have for 20 years.  Or should I ask for a different test? I don't know much about this and I have no idea what to do or what to ask.  Please anyone if they have advice it would be much appreciated! Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
