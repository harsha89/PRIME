I relate to the surrealness of it all, as I felt the very same way. You are going to feel that way for awhile, it is a whirlwind of appts, pondering treatment options, and fear and worry. The good news is that once you have full imaging and pathology reports, you will nail down your plan and get rolling. You will feel better once that happens. Limbo is the worst part of all, and the tests too. Hugs ",

Give yourself permission to feel whatever you feel. You may find it easier not to put alot of energy into making others feel more comfortable by being super cheery today. It is ok not to be a beaming positive beacon 24/7. Really. Not that you need to be depressed either, just a mid range is fine. It takes alot of energy to pretend. I wished I had not done so much of it myself. It taxed me severely. This is a rollercoaster of highs, lows and everything else in between. You have just begun your journey, but remember one thing-- most important priority is you. I know what you mean about the faces of concern. They do not stop, it is human nature, and you need to be prepared to see alot of it, from family, friends and strangers. Try not to focus on others reactions, you cannot control it anddo not need the psychic weight. Come here whenever you need understanding and gals that get it. Just a few tips from a person slightly ahead of you...i wished I had been able to articulate this and put it to better practice in my own beginning, would have saved me so much grief. Only now can I see this. That being said, you go and enjoy your loving family and friends today....blessings and best wishes ",

But, I thought many times I would never finish and here it is, my last tx on Nov. 21!!!  You have excellent tips posted here by those that have been through it, and keep those handy. The most surprising thing to me was the differences in SE from chemo to chemo. Be ready for anything is my tip, because it can differ each time.  The worst SE for me was the Big D and the nausea. And you all will have degrees of some, and none of other SE.  Another tip, is do not eat anything you love during your infusion or at the facility. The thought of anything I ate the first time before I knew better still makes me ill today. I always wear comfy clothing and all of it goes into the washer immediately. The shoes never enter the house. I touch nothing at facility and hand wash like crazy!  You need to prevent any infections you can. Wash those hands, always. Do not let dehyradtion from nausea and the Big D get ahead of you, or you will end up needing a transfusion of liquids and zofran and/or being placed in hospital.  Call the doc before it is serious, they can fix it.  if you have someone that can come to chemo with you as a watchdog/advocate, do so. Do not accept insensitive, or unhygienic standards from any medical staff. Never be afraid to ask questions.  Let the advocate be the heavy!  My DH has asked numerous times before allowing someone near me, did you wash your hands? He will not allow any harm to come to me and you may need that on your off days. He will not let one nice, but particularly clumsy nurse near me! Also, abstaining from alcohol really helped me....now at the end, my liver enzymes are elevated so any less poison into it is a good idea.  I so wanted to eat well and fresh raw food, but....ended up only being able to endure frozen entrees, the BRAT diet (a must if you get the Big D), and muffins, cereal, crackers. It is okay so long as you eat and after chemo is the time to eat raw foods and diet. exercise as you are able to. I began a walking program after dx!  Before dx I was a very sedentary person and never walked. It has really helped me most of all. but, do not force it either. Listen to your body....rest whenever you need to, eat what you can, and avoid negative energy in all forms. Lastly, if your career is unrewarding or stressful, or if you hate it, consider quitting if at all financially doable. I did, and can say due to chemo, no way could I work. It was the best decision, and not all mine entirely as I was basically tossed away once my showdog standards of performance dropped! Well....no matter, that job was killing me in the very literal sense. I do not miss it at all. When I do go back to work, I am only going to do what I want to! Best wishes my sisters, you can do this and are strong!",

My own RO is overjoyed at my burnt condition. i am not. I will insert a pic under this post, and keep in mind, it was days ago. Now, it is worse. And I have 4 to go. That being said, I just hope it works to prevent recurrence. My RO said that in 35 years, he has NEVER had a LOCAL recurrence, but there have been distant ones (stage 4). Ok then, I guess I will finish. In summary....DO use the cool wet cloth heat removal method, and do not wait till you are purple to do it. Do not use ice packs. Get some calendula cream, use it. Walk around naked when you can, put your arm over your head as much as possible, or keep it away from your body to let heat escape. I am fresh out of xanax, but I highly recommend it. The discomfort and mental anguish call for it, for those that can take it. I wished I had gotten more for after chemo. Hard to sleep with second degree burns. But......I will also say that though I bitch, in the waiting room was a mag with a piece on a local philanthropist that treats late stage cancer victims and their families to a Florida vacation, fully paid and four star all the way. One lady was 39 with children. She had pancreatic cancer, deadly from the start. At least we have a shot. So.....when I look at it that way, who am I to complain? Trying to be positive.

I am just tired of having a positive attitude, tired of being a trooper, tired of the toll this has and will continue to take. I think rads is like chemo---they do not tell you the truth about how awful it CAN be, they hope for the best and deal with it when and if horror ensues. Then they nod their heads knowingly and try to fix it. Fatigue: each day about an hour after rads, it overcomes me and I must lie down. Sleeping about 9 hours each night!

I think it best to be honest with them, they are at an age to handle it. You have a good prognosis, right? So it will be a year or more of treatments, surgery, etc. and then moving on to a new normal. It may be more comforting for them if they know that and that they can help mom during. Kids really are amazing and resilient. Please do not put pressure onto yourself by having to maintain a false front with them. Maybe wait till after the holidays is all and when you have your full tx plan in place. Also, you will not give a flying fig about the gossipy ladies with no lives at your kids school soon. And they too will know or suspect, and are going to dither on anyways. Some may surprise you in a good way.People are going to amaze you with their reactions-good, bad and ugly!

They say it takes about three days to get results before they will know what it is. It was uncomfortable, a little bit painful but not the worst thing I've been through. Mostly I was in shock and at times crying and shaking.  So now just in the waiting stage and of course I am certainly hoping for the best. Actually I'm terrified it will be the worst.  I am hanging out at home today recovering because it still is very sore in my armpit and breast.

Trying to be positive, and both surgeon and onco are very positive, but I can't stop myself. of course it's useless for me to do this!  I have no control over what it is to be.

The underarm stuff went thru all healing stages, last was most painful, red, oozing, irritated. I know I sound like a broken record, but sunburn my ass. Unless of course my RO meant to say, 3rd degree sunburn with a side of ouch. All the crap they told me to do was a waste of time and money. At least my arm got stretched from holding it away from my body 24/7. Anyway, glad it is over, and glad I did it despite my bitching. It should prevent any local recurrence. One tip I got from a rad lady is to use neosporin once it gets to the peeling. Used the cream, not the ointment, and it was great and has pain relief in it! I am certain it healed it quicker. It sure felt better immediately. I am happy for those that have minimal effects, and jealous of you too. Hoping minimal SEs for all my sisters here. I am off the rads board for now....moving on to Tamoxifen soon, woohoo! Take care everyone",

This community saved me, and you are in a good place here. I had IDC, also well-differentiated, with no history, and I had it spread to one lymph node too. I am all done with active treatments and had a complete response to chemo. My chemo port removed today. You CAN do this. It is not gonna be fun, but it is not all bad. This is a new language, so best to read about definitions, protocols and procedures right here on BCO vs. google. Take your path report (get copies of all your test results and scans from now on, so you can research terms, etc.) and ask your oncologist to explain it in layman's terms. These things really help you to get used to this idea and advocate for yourself. Most important are Stage, Grade, hormone receptor status and whether its HER positive. These will be in your path report. Detailed, accurate and up to date info on all these terms is right here on the regular BCO home page. All these factors will play into determining your treatment plan. Another vital thing is to get the best oncologist (breast cancer specialist) and BS surgeon--not a general surgeon. Find an onco that has a bedside manner, and is not an arrogant a-hole. it may be ok to compromise, If the technical skill is there. You are going to have a long, intensely personal relationship, so choose wisely. Second and third opinions are a good idea. It is different for every woman, depending on the variables, so try not to (not easy) get overwhelmed by the whirlwind of treatment you will soon be thrust into, and not to research anything but YOUR exacttype of cancer for now. Come here often and ask questions, or just vent. Many women find that a mild anti anxiety drug short term helps. I needed that, and it did wonders for me. Phew! I won't throw anything else at ya tonight, cuz I know you are reeling. PM me anytime, I'll be sending you positive vibes! Candy",

I had a CPR with chemo/herceptin which ended in July 2015, rads and the wonderful double BMX too. This seems like a pain I've had before, in the same place. It has come and gone and I remember having it on the day of my bone scan and feeling certain it was mets then. But the scan was clear. Feels like a strained muscle. I have not done anything to strain it-- always had a tight left hip, and chemo exacerbated the joint pain, as has Tamoxifen. I also can blame Tamoxifen for my foot pain and other joint pains, which all come and go. Feels like arthritis. So maybe, I should not waste time worrying and say F**K it, like before. I see my onco on Monday for a regular checkup..so I guess we will go get a scan or two after I tell her this news. Double *&ck, I say. Trying to work but my concentration is shot. Took a Midol and it's working but pain still there. So I am not asking for it to be okay, because either it will or won't be. Just any practical advice would be appreciated from those that have been there. It's my first mets scare.

I have three drains and yesterday they put out about 35 altogether. I hope it doesn't hurt to get my staples out but there's not much I can do about it. Ditto about the drains. Going to the bathroom is important after surgery, and I've always had problems with it previously. Yesterday that problem went away and I am so relieved! Also I've cut my pain meds so that probably had a lot to do with it. We are expecting rain here today, and it's so nice just to be able to relax and hear it on the awning, without being in that awful burning pain I was in! I have listen to Sandra, and she's absolutely right. It's made a huge difference even in just a day, not doing anything I'm not supposed to with my arm. Thank you again Sandra, I'm thinking of you and your hubby today and sending more prayers your way. I hope everyone is doing good today too. It's a hard time of year to go through this, but it's better than cancer. We canceled our Christmas dinner plans out, because I'm just uncomfortable with all my various apparatus. Hope to go out",

I can say as to bills and work---I found a foundation in my area that has already paid 1500 of my uncovered medicals. Search for those, ask, find them and apply. Why go into financial ruin for getting sick! Some are also non need based, those are the best ones with least paperwork. I am working on one tha will pay my mortgage for up to a year right now, funded by the feds Working will differ for me too, but contact your local unemployment office, or womens resource center. I learned there are FREE tuitions, training, etc. of unreal proportions available. Medical is huge (hahahahahahahaha), we all have seen that, and you as a \"displaced homemaker\" qualify for tons! Let them call you whatever, if it gets you help you deserve. I am a paralegal, had a great job, but will be freelancing till tx is completed. I hope to start right after rads. Hard adjustments, but necessary. I am not ready to go rightback to the grind full time. My squishies! Well, maybe today I will go, but more likely tomorrow.

Very first thing I did was tell my GP to get out that RX for Xanax. I only take it ever if I fly on a plane!  Desperate times call for desperate measures however and I can tell you honestly it is been a godsend. I don't think I would've been able to function without it.  I will keep in mind the two week theory.  Even though I have more information now things are still so uncertain up in the air and no plan has been formed so it is very difficult. I'm just glad there are people here that understand and will share their own experiences it really helps. Maybe posting on a different board  soon because I am considering trying to obtain SSI disability and take next year off of work to get my full and utter attention to kicking this thing. I'm 46 and have been working since I was 15 years old so maybe it's time to get some help. I have a very stressful job and I just have no desire today to even think about going back frankly. Anyway see you on the boards thank you so much!!!!!",

And I am on working on my last round of chemo in saying this to you. first, stay off google, it is useless now and stress and horror invoking. Trust me, you will have plenty of time to research if you need to, but it is not your friend now. Also, my biopsy was not very painful, they numb you up and all. It aint fun either, but you can do it. my advice is, take someone with you. Ask questions. Sometimes the techs and radiologist will answer but sometimes they are vague to spare you, but they have a good idea from just looking. I highly recommend anxiety meds because it is a defining moment in your life, either way. I almost passed out in the waiting rooms between exams as I was so freaked out. What you are feeling is normal and a scary thing. I wish I could say more to ease your fears but there is just not much for it. This community is here for you though and can help. Please let us know how it goes, and one last thing is get a cc of the pathology and imaging for yourselves, because you will not remember words, etc. when doc tells you results.

Sandra, your advice about NOT doing stuff helped me so much. I am sure it saved me from alot of pain. Thank you! And I am thinkin of you and hubster today. How wonderful the little things in life are. Last night I was laying in my own warm snuggly bed, with two snuggly little kitties, and thinking about all the times I've taken it for granted. My first shower Was heaven. Being able to do light housework too. Hubby and I are going garage saleing and gallivanting around today, what a treat that will be because I haven't left my house since surgery till yesterday and that was to go to get my drains out! I'm going to cook a nice dinner tonight. I hope you all have a very good day and remember Sandras advice not to overdo! ",

No pain at all with staples removal. Another bonus. So...onto rads for me sisters, likely next week. Then I am taking a long break, until I decide on recon. I am over this chit and cannot handle any more invasions for awhile. I want to get some prosthesis and rock them for awhile. I admire all who are strong enough to do immediate recon.

My wonderful husband Built me a small fire last night or backyard, and we celebrated with a bottle of champagne and by burning a lot of my chemo related documents. Ha! i am a heavy duty partier, was asleep by 9. I'm feeling better today but last night was a bit out of sorts. We took down our tree today, and I rested alot in between. Nice to pack away the stuff, to have the room back. Think I am gonna pursue serious PTSD counseling soon. I could describe it as this: I feel like I was shot out of a cannon on July 29, 2014 and have been in a fiery freefall ever since. I windmill of my arms and tried to cushion my fall but I can see the ground coming up to meet me and it's not really pretty. It looks like it's going to hurt. It has already hurt alot, every needlestick, every side effect, every tear, every bill, every f&@$$ckin appointment, every stranger fondling my now gone breasts, every angry and sad impulse, seeing my husband's fear and my friends pain, each moment. You all know exactly what I mean. But I have yet to hit the ground. All I really need do is look in the mirror naked but.....there are no words. Anyways, whatever may come we all have today. And it was a good day. So, I am sending DH out for the most incredible mexican food, And chillin here with my family-DH of 25 years and my 2 rotten kittaehs.

I will say that my surgeon to be lifted my heart and mind when we saw him on Friday. I still appreciate your information because he didn't really go over the pathology with me I think my oncologist will be doing that. However he did tell me that he believes it to be stage two and both my tumors are about 1 cm. in my right breast with the one tumor and then the right lymph node does have involvement. Naturally lymph node thing is scared me silly. It terrifies me that it may already be everywhere else in my body.  I am going for an MRI on the other breast too, this week, because he said it's possible that it may be required or recommended that mastectomies eventually be done on both, after chemo. Also the surgeon immediately told me when I told him we were planning to go to Maine on vacation on August 29 ,not yet to cancel my plans, because he thinks perhaps my protocol may be able to be worked in!!! I guess that means if chemo is not a horror on me that perhaps I'll feel like going which to me sounds unbelievable but hopeful?  We like him because he said there are new things such as what you're describing that \"kick breast cancers ass\". Told me bluntly to that next year is going to suck but he thinks that in five years I will be telling everyone my story and encouraging them.  I can't express how much your post meant to me when I woke up this morning after a semi sleepless night again and  feelings of sadness and despair. I am doing a mind, body, spirit approach. Off all processed foods, no alcohol, sugar, meat or dairy. My husband of 24 years is unbelievable. I'm realizing that i have taken a lot of things in my life granted he being the main one. He's takes me out every night and we walk around the block to begin my exercise and battle plan. I am 35 pounds overweight right now and have not taken care of myself since my father's death in 2009. Talk about incentive to make changes! Blessings & love!!!! I will update when I know more. It's going to be a week!!",

Ladies here report minimal pain, hard to believe but true. My PS agrees that recon is the painful part. This is all speculative on my part, just sharing some from the boards that I have read here.

Through trial and error we figured out a few tricks. First of all I am a short girl so my drain tubes were way too long for my body. This resulted in a lot of tubing being hanging down around the tops of my thighs. Each time I use the bathroom here i am struggling with low hangin tubes. He sterilized scissors and cut a few inches off the end of each tube and reattachedthe bulbs. Huge difference, those few inches of tubing on three drains added weight. Then he rigged up my tubes with covers. He just took a bottom seam of an old T-shirt, and each tube has about two pieces on it. This makes a difference when the tubes are rubbing on your bare rskin, they will not stick and cling and pull. Also, we added some triple antib to the incisions and use the notched gauze on each site around the tubes. Waaaay better! we figured out too that you need not milk from the very top to bottom...if you start halfway down the tube, the suction will take over and empty it! After all these changes I can say that today is the first day I don't want to walk off a building. I actually feel pretty decent and am comfortable enough. I really hope for a better day for us all soon! Thank you everybody for being here and allowing me to complain. It's a Christmas miracle!",

Exhaustion is huge for me too, and I had no infection or TEs. This takes alot of time, we all just need to pretend we are queens and let others serve us! I do only little things now around the house, only in the past few days, but go to sleep by 8 every night. I am not pushing anything. I lift nothing that has any weight. I drove once alone and thrift shopped for an hour and it totalled me. Too soon. Still slightly swollen and sore, but a tiny bit better each day. Goin grocery shoppin today and DH will be driving and cart pushing. It is easier to give in to our bodies than resist and suffer..I am convinced I am healing better and faster since I gave in.",

At best, chemo can feel like a mild flu, and you will be tired. At worst, you can be very ill, repeatedly, all thru. I was unable to work and lost my job due to chemo, as they did not want to be inconvenienced by my many absences. It is a bad time to start a new job, i am sorry to say. But that does not mean that you cannot try it. And, your chemo experience may be not so bad. Worst thing is they will not keep you on, right? So go for it, as much as you feel like you can.

This is a very personal decision, and many ladies do cold caps and ice their toes and fingers too. I would say research it and ask your onco, then decide. As far as hair, it was less traumatic than i would have thought losing it. I was consumed with chemo and it was a non issue for me. Wigs are actually fun and cheap these days and i wear three or go commando, or use hats. Hair is coming back already, so again, up to you but if you do not use cold caps, cut it, then shave it when it starts to fall out, it is just easier and less drama/trauma, because losin it in clumps is upsetting and freaky. And...it is fun to scare people by whippin it off now and then! My DH offered to shave his constantly but i said one kojak was enough in our house.",

My two tumors that were palpable are unable to be found on manual exam, they dissolved after round 2 of chemo. You are not alone! Good advice that was given to me from BCO members: Peruse these boards relating to surgery, radiation, and your chemo protocol. Stay off the Stage 4 boards, and do not use dr. Google. Get copies of all your scan reports, and pathology too, as they will be greatly needed in doing research. I am sorry you have the BC but you will find this the best place to learn, cry, yell, vent, and chat whenever you need to. Lastly, it is not your fault you got it, so do not go there ever. Hugs",

Even the mammogram that I did the morning I got diagnosed showed nothing, and I have multiple tumors in that particular breast. So I wonder if all those mammograms maybe contributed to my disease!  Only an ultrasound picked it up. I'm angry because even though my breasts are very dense no one ever recommended a 3-D mammogram to me, which I am told may have picked it up sooner.  Anyway I started chemo seven days after my biopsy/diagnosis, due to the aggressive nature of HER, and lymph node involvement.  ",
