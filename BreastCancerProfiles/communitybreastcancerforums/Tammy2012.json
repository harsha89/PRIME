I did receive a call from Myriad telling me that they were in negotiations with Tricare and was expecting the test to start being covered sometime in October.  October 1 is the beginning of our fiscal year.  I called Tricare on Oct 2 and it's still not being covered. I call them every 2 weeks and tell them i'm documenting our conversations and i advise them to do the same.   I'm triple negative and was relying on those test results to decide if i would have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.  I went with the lumpectomy and started radation on thursday. Here is the new code: 81211 Myriad told me this code covered everything.  BRCA 1 & 2 Comprehensive Testing.  Myriad was also kind enough to offer me a 10% cash discount.  I just needed to pay them $3006 up front and they would be more than happy to do the testing for me.  I tell ya...i just want to send them a big fat Thank you card!!    ",
