One sister had a very aggressive bc that killed her in the year 2000, at age 42. Another sister was successfully treated and is still with us (with other issues, unrelated to cancer). We are also Ashkenazi Jewish. I had genetic testing for all known markers, and ALL were negative. This means either that we are an especially unlucky family, or that there are genetic links that have not yet been identified. ",
