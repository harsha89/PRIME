Second breast was all fine, MRI came negative, no family history, genetic testing also was negative. We talked to 2 surgeons about a preventive mastectomy on the second breast and was told there is no medical reason for doing it and that Tamo over the next 5-10 years will help prevent occurrence in the second breast. Every now and then, we think should we have gone for double mastectomy instead not from cosmetic point of view but just to reduce the chance of recurrence. Please share your experiences...
