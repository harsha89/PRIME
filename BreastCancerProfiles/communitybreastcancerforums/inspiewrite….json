It's also because I assume it's due to an injury--would never dream of asking if I thought I was inquiring about something like bc!  Once a car salesman about my compression sleeve--and then told me he'd worn one for years after a severe burn. I don't ever tell them b/c, if it's a stranger. If they ask \"Do you have carpal tunnel?\" I say \"something like that.\" Sometimes my dh speaks up and tells them \"it's old age\" and that shuts them up. Once a waitress got so insistent and I ended up telling her everything--and was pretty annoyed with her. I think she was sorry she asked.   Sometimes I just say \"I have edema\" and leave it at that. Let them look it up if they like. Getting ready to go run karaoke with my hubby at a graduation party today--and I know I will get the question several times. *sigh*",
