I'd very much appreciate your feedback!! I'm worried on this part of MRI report: Dense parenchymal structure was observed in both breasts, being more distinctive in the subareolar areas (type C pattern). It has a dense fibroglandular composition. 6.5x4.5 mm, 6.2x4.5 mm and 5x4 mm sized cystic changes that are characterized with hyper intense micro cysts during the T2 weighted investigations were observed. Following administration of IV contrast material, multiple circular and ovaid configuration displaying nodular opaqueness displaying area with no larger distinctive diameter than 5 mm were observed in the right breast.

I'm waiting for my cycle to get an MRI, as the doc said it would be only informative during 5-13 days of the cycle. I will really push for PET/CT though, as these lymphnodes are driving me crazy now.",

When you get your US/MRI, ask the docs to check on your auxiliary lymphnodes, too. PS. I can't figure out how to send pms on this website.",
