    "Content": "SandraASurvivor wrote: ok so I just started reconstruction 3wks ago. I had a tissue expander placed on the right side. The left required a LDF due to the damage from radiation. I haven't really had very much pain or even discomfort. My dr is amazing so no complaints there. But yesterday I noticed that my back started to seriously hurt right where the incision is. It's not the incision itself but the place where the muscle USED to be. I have heard of soldiers having phantom pain when they have lost a limb but I swear the \"muscle\" in my back is killing me. I just took 3x the amount of pain medicine I am prescribed in hopes of making this pain stop. Has anyone else had this? If so, what helped. I have tried a heating pad and different positioning but am finding no relief. Log in to post a reply",
