I am relatively young (42) and was recently diagnosed with IDC so mine presented as a tiny lump. When my primary physician dismissed it I went the next day to a walk in clinic. Is there any way you could do that instead of waiting? I didn't really like going to an unfamiliar doctor but at least he sent me for more tests. Your symptoms could be from a number of things not just IBC. It's most likely something not too serious like a skin condition or reaction to something. But good for you for getting it checked out. I wish you the best and you can always come here for support. Big hugs to you and stay strong.",

I was diagnosed in June and had surgery in July. Had to have genetic testing too and the waiting was the hardest part. I am 42 years old and telling my identical twin sister, husband and parents was nerve racking. But they all took it well and continue to be very positive and supportive throughout all of this. I wish you the best and hope that you get more anwers soon. I know the feeling of being out of body or disconnected. I felt a lot of that in the beginning and still do sometimes. But it gets better as you get more information and a plan in place. Stay strong. You sound like a strong healthy lady who will overcome this.",
