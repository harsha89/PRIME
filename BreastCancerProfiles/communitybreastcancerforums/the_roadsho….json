I wish you all the luck in the world. I imagine you have the determination to stick to any prescribed nutritional plan. I'm doing a bit of both. Had surgery on Monday to remove tumour but have yet to see pathology report. I'm all raw and would be vegan if I weren't eating quark twice a day! The very best to you.",

I came across it when I read an interview with two people who had been healed of cancer naturally who both mentioned it had helped them (check out the reviews on Amazon). Got it yesterday and so far it makes for very interesting reading. In fact, reading is pretty much all I've done since I was diagnosed on 24th January. I have also visited the Wellness Warrior's website and she makes a compelling case for the Gerson Therapy. Definitely food for thought. Anyway, I'd love to hear what you're up to and how it's going. If you want to pm me my address is sian.delaney@hotmail.co.uk.   Take care and big hugs, Sian (the_roadshow)",
