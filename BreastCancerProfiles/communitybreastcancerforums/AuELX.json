It's now so bad that I am huffing and puffing at the slightest exertion, like walking from one room to another. Forget about climbing stairs or walking the dog. I also have a very high pulse rate (120s-140s) at every appointment, but my blood pressure is always normal. I am only very slightly anemic. My onco doesn't think I'm anemic enough to cause such shortness of breath.    My onco ordered tests. We have ruled out heart issues with an EKG and lung issues with a chest CT. And my latest test shows a normal TSH, so I do not have an overactive thyroid. Has anyone else experienced severe shortness of breath while on Abraxane/Avastin? Any ideas on what is causing my shortness of breath ... and what can be done to improve it? I'm desperate to get any improvement. And I'm exceedingly grateful for any suggestions. Thanks so much!!! 10 years and still counting!

While no lesions have ever been found in either breast, I've had multiple bone mets on my vertebra, ribs, and ilium. Lots of radiation treatment and bone scans, but no chemo or surgery thus far. We're all \"survivors\" regardless of how long. -AuELX",
