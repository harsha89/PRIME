This is the short version of my so far short journey (which doesn't always seem so short): On July 12, my right nipple started bleeding...not oozing or slight discharge, but dripping on the floor bleeding. At this point, I have had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound which revealed microcalcifications (in both breasts) which the radiologist said didn't look much different from the previous year. If it weren't for the bleeding, they wouldn't be very concerned. He scheduled me for a bilateral stereotactic needle biopsy (which ended up only being the left due to blood vessels in the way). The biopsy on the left was diagnosed as atypical ductal hyperplasia. Next I saw a surgeon, who ordered an MRI. After a fight with the insurance company, the MRI was performed and revealed three spots of concern in the right breast. The radiologist, after reviewing the results, determined that only two spots were worrisome. I was then scheduled for an MRI guided biopsy of the right side. The two spots that were biopsied were diagnosed as an atypical lobular hyperplasia and and atypical papilloma. I am now scheduled for lumpectomies on both breasts. I'm told that they need to be sure the areas around these precancerous areas are clear or if there is any cancer. I'm hoping to have definitive answers soon. I can't say that I spend much time worrying about the outcome, as the worrying wouldn't change the results. I will say, however, it is always on our minds. We talk about the what ifs and all the other possibilities. I live in Texas with my husband (who is very supportive). Other than one granddaughter, the rest of my family is in Ohio. Sometimes it would be easier if they lived closer. Do these procedures sound familiar to anyone out there? Thanks for listening. Log in to post a reply",
