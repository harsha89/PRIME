Shortly after some days of itching i had a light black bruise on my right breast slight far from my aerola. is this a sin of IBC or normal infection? and the black portion is quite small and it doesn't change in size. the lumph in my armpit is slightly painful when it is touched or when i move my hand. i feel itching on my breast after 3 to 4 days time span and my breast become reddish again. and the dark portion came after ithcing my breasts with my nails on my right breast.",
