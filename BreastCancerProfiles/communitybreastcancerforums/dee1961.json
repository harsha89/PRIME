Looking for a reason that we got BC I suppose is normal, but there are no concrete reasons why we got it and others did not. We just have to accept that it did happen to us and move on the best ways we can. And another vent is that I HATE the breaking news thing that BCO has put up on the site-not! Did you know that being FAT causes it too? Â Argh! now I'm stressed, I think I'll have a Twinkie and a Bloody Mary for breakfast.",

Your insurance should have to pay for removal since they are part of the breast removal for your cancers. Propylatctic masts may not be covered. Check with your insurance co. Take care!",

I ended up having bilateral mastectomies and so far that has been the extent of my treatment. You really will have to wait until you have the additional surgery to find out what stage your breast cancer is. I know the waiting stinks but you will get through this. Cry all you want and surround yourself with supportive family and friends. Take a deep breath and keep posting here, we are here for you. Dee~ Â ",

I was a but sore but never had to take anything more than Ibuprofen for pain. Just rest the day of the procedure and plan on going to the party. I cant give you 100% gaurantee that you will make it to the party, but I really don't think you should have too much of a problem with the lumpectomy. Again, good luck! :) Let us know what happens with your results.",
