I just had my third dose of chemo yesterday.  I'm 40 yrs old with no family history, Brca tests came back negative.   For those of you that had chemo before surgery what was your experience like and did you have total of 6 cycles before surgery and then surgery.  HOw long did you wait for surgery after chemo ended? did you choose lumpectomy, unilateral mascectomy, or bilateral masectomy? I am ER & PR negative and HerNeu positive (3+). I want to choose the best option for best possible outcome and to lower chance of recurrence.  My oncologist wants to go for masectomy and wait for a few years for reconstruction.  I am debating whether i should go for radical modified mascetomy (from my understanding it is locally advanced as per pet scan but no other metasis other than suspious for lymph node metasis).  Brain mri was clear and pet scan showed the same thing. I have 4 kids (17, 15, 13 with autism, and 6 year old).  My kids need me....I loved my breasts and i general I was great shape...everyone would always say that I did not look like the mom of a 17 year old...) but at this point I desparately want to see my kids grow up and whatever will help me achieve that is my goal with god's help and mercy.

I thought kadcyla was working. Now she wants switch to gemzar. I'm frustrated bc i was tolerating kadcyla quite well and all levels are excellent. i need brain radiation bc they found 22 sub centimeter lesions in the brain. so there are 2 trials. one is with soranfib and WBR and other one is immunotherapy and WBR. I'm really sad that i can't continue on kadcyla.",
