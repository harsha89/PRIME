I am a breastfeeding momma and 7 months ago I developed a massive abscess (8cm * 10cm) that had to be surgically drained. Due to the suspected damage it did to my breast and the fact that I was still having lots of swelling a month after the drainage, I was sent for a mammogram and ultrasound. Ultrasound found nothing but a galactocele, but the mammogram found scattered microcalcifications. I was advised to have a biopsy at that time just to make sure they were nothing, but my breast surgeon didn't want \"one more hole in my already traumatized, healing breast\". He called the radiologist and they agreed to a 6 month follow up instead. Unfortunately, I just went for the follow up mammogram and was told that the microcalcifications have increased a good deal, especially in an area very near where the abscess was located. It raises so many questions now. Did I develop the abscess because there is something there blocking the flow of milk? Since I had the procedure to drain the abscess, I have always had sharp pains in that breast, my chest/collarbone/armpit on that same side. I have also had swelling in my armpit area, especially the area between my breast and armpit (no lumps that I can feel, just a fullness). I have always believed this was just a little lymphedema due to the fact that the breast surgeon had to cut through lymph nodes and ducts to get down to the abscess. Now I am starting to wonder if there is a correlation between these symptoms and the microcalcifications. Having that abscess drained under just local anesthetic was honestly one of the worst experiences of my life! Just thinking about the biopsy and having that breast cut on again is so, so scary! I am really hoping the biopsy is not that bad! I can take pain just fine, but the thought of this procedure is seriously messing with my head! I tried to ask the radiologist some clarifying questions, but his answers were vague and I couldn't get much out of him at all. I asked if the microcalcs had formed a pattern or were still scattered. He stated that they were still scattered but had increased a good deal. He also stated that he strongly urged that I go for the biopsy this time and not wait another 6 months like before. I couldn't get a BIRADS score out of him, he just \"couldn't tell me what my chances were that this is cancer or benign\". I am assuming it was a 3 six months ago, but now would be classified as a 4. Sorry, I know I'm rambling. My thoughts are pretty scattered. I'm scared of having cancer, losing my ability to breastfeed my daughter or other future children (this is all in my breast that produces by far the most milk). I'm 32 with no family history of BC. I am scheduled for a stereotactic biopsy this coming Thursday. I really hope they will have some good news for me! Log in to post a reply",
