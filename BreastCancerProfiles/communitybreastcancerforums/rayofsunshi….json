So I'm glad you mentioned it, that way I can be prepared. It helps a lot to know your recovery timeframe! I don't know if I'll be brave enough to show up for work the next day, hahah, that's pretty amazing. But it's good to know that I can plan for not having too much downtime. And thinking about some fun time with a family member gives me something pleasant to look forward to :-) Thanks again so very much for your support. I feel loads better from where my mind was 24h ago.",

Understanding some details and what it was like for you helps me relax a little. I hope I can provide the same level-headed reassurance to someone else going through this some day :-)   I am a total newbie in terms of taking charge of my medical treatment...I have never even asked for a medical record before! But what you are saying makes a lot of sense. I started a list of questions to ask by BS - including if it will be wire-guided, which she didn't indicate. I do like her a lot - she was kind and helpful.  The more I think about the jerk rad the more sure I am that I will go to his office this week, get my records, and not go back. I want to tell him about what he missed on the u/s because I'm mad that he did, and I don't want other patients seeing him to go through the same thing. But maybe I am just trying to find an outlet for my upset feelings right now. It doesn't change the fact that it happened. So maybe I just need to move on. I do want to have the surgery ASAP, but I am alone right now and hoping to time it so that a family member can fly out to be with me. Pushing for July at the latest. Will keep you posted on the date & how things progress!  Thanks again...hope you have a great weekend. You certainly helped cheer mine up. =)",
