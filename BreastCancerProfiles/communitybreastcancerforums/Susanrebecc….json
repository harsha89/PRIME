    "Content": "Feb 7, 2018 11:41PM - edited Feb 7, 2018 11:44PM by Susanrebecca Did they teach you how to do your own manual lymph drainage massage? Lots on YouTube. Really helped me with swelling and pain. Mine was bad for months even with massage, taping and physical therapy. It seemed to slowly get better after 3 years .Arimidex made my lymphdema significantly worse. Stopped taking it. I am now going to try tamoxifen. Since my lumpectomy was on the right side. I have to sleep on my left side or it increases the lymphdema in my right breast and armpit. My thoughts are with you.",
