At that point the fatigue was awful. It didn't matter how much sleep I got I was still so fatigued. It's getting much better now almost back to my normal energy level. As for the topical creams I was so fortunate my treatment center gave me all of the creams. There are 2 that I found to work the best. Calendula Cream was the best for the sunburn and minor burns. The last 5 treatments were the worst. Those were the boast treatments where the radiation is directed at the tumor bed. I had several burns the size of a dime where the skin pealed and were open wounds. AKA as skin break down. Again my RO gave my SSD Cream (silver sulfadiazine cream) this was the best. The burns dried out and began to heal in 2 days. I didn't have much luck with the Aloa or the Aquaphor. Found Aquaphor to be so oily and messy and not much pain relief. Calendula worked so much better.I hope this will help as you begin this process.",
