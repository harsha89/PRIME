There is not breast cancer in the family, but my mother, grandmother, aunt, great aunt,all had benign growths.  Not cancer, but still high chance for some type of growth.  I get regular mammograms, in fact just had one a few weeks ago.  I am slim, don't smoke, exercise several times per week. I am hyperthyroid and always wondered whether this condition puts me at higher risk for cancer. Would like to learn more online if possible.  Any thoughts, similar risk factors? Thanks for the sharing of experiences and opinions on this site.  Log in to post a reply",
