You will get through it...it kills cancer!! Taxol so far is going good...no SEs to speak of. 4. Eat as healthy as you can....for me each AC brought different tastes. Dont eat what you love...it changes your tastes for it. 5. Weight gain or loss can be taken care of after chemo. Feel good and be good to yourself. 6.
