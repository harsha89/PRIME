The 2 shots in the hospital...I asked for it as I had been told it would help, but they said they didn't follow the practice as it was not verified to be necessary. From now on, I plan to start the Claritin the day of chemo and take for 4 days. Oh...in addition to a Colace as I had a real problem with that as well. I feel like there is so much I know now that it can only get better...!!!??? ",

I live in Phoenix, but am traveling to Cancer Treatment Centers in Illinois for treatment with my husband. My mom has virtually moved in to help with my son. (Thank Goodness!) I am doing neo adjuvant 4 x AC and then 4 x Taxotere/ Carboplatin. I am IDC Grade 3 Triple Neg. No nodes known to be involved. After chemo, I will do double mastectomy. Going into chemo, I thought that I was going to \"rock it\". I was in the best shape of my life. My diet has been it's best ever and my body was at its strongest thanks to my exercise routine. What I thought I was going to \"rock\" has knocked me on my behind. The neulasta pain was by far the most pain I have ever experienced. Once I got beyond that, I thought I was getting my legs back under me and on day 8 ended up in the ER neutropenic with a nearly 103 fever. 4 nights in the hospital...multiple rounds of preventative IV antibiotics, more neulasta type shots and the pain that came along with them, and a little ruckus over elevated liver enzymes. I came home Sunday morning with my wbc over 11,000 and felt great. Monday afternoon, I started running another fever. ??? Told by Dr to treat with Motrin and Tylenol as there was no way I was neutropenic again. Fever is gone this morning and I'm feeling a little better. I'm hating night sweats, headaches... hair aches. Before chemo, I had cut my long red hair shorter, dyed it black, pink, and blue. The idea was that I controlled the loss of my hair. My hair has been gone for nearly 3 weeks. \"This\" hair was jumping ship this morning, so I've just finished having my husband clip it all down to a 2. Even though I thought it was coming it's still hard...but I guess it's just one more part to get through. I'm trying to read through the forum to get to know the group, but I feel like I am late to the party.   ",

My AC #4 isn't until next Monday and then I don't start Taxotere and Carboplatin (anyone know the abbreviation for that combo?) until July 13th. I won't be done with those until September 14th. By the time I get done with surgery, it will be mid to late October at the earliest. Time is moving so slowly for me, but life keeps on speeding along for everyone around me. My parents put their house on the market just before I was diagnosed in early April. They planned to move across the country and buy a beachfront condo. After my dx, they decided that they would just leave their house on the market....thinking it would take forever to sell. Well, it sold this week and they've put in an offer on the beachfront condo they've been keeping an eye on. They don't want to actually move until after I finish treatment, so they are moving in with us. I'm really happy that they have been around a lot to help out with the house and with DS. It's made it really easy for me to concentrate on myself. It's also allowed us to leave DS here at home while we travel back and forth to Illinois. I'm really, really grateful. With that said, can I vent for a minute? OMG! They are driving me nuts. Between the cancer, my treatments (& travel), and my parents relocation plans, everyone is under so much pressure. I'm trying not to let all the little things bother me and I realize how fortunate I am. Everyone is rearranging their lives to help pick up the slack for me. I feel guilty and useless about 80% of the time. On a positive note, I made it to the gym on Monday for my weightlifting class and plan on going again tomorrow morning. It's nice when \"feeling the burn\" doesn't relate to cancer treatment in some way. I haven't been as active as I was before DX, but at least it's something. I really miss walking in the park, but now that 110 degree heat is here to stay...that ain't happening. Well wishes to everyone! ....Side note about the L-Glutamine and it tasting so horribly. I don't drink tea or juice, but I did throw it into my morning smoothie and I couldn't even tell it was there. I'm going to try to stir it into my yogurt tomorrow and see if it's a similar effect. I'm still not sure how I'll choke it down when I'm nauseous, but I'll have to cross that bridge when I get there. ",

Day 2 was tolerable enough (we fly to Illinois from Phx for treatment) with the flight home being turbulent as usual. Days 3-7 were a mixed bag of nausea, fatigue, Diarrhea, weakness, zero appetite...day 8 turned the corner and I felt like a human being again...until I went neutropenic again on day 9.

My eyelashes are prickly. Hair is nearly all gone...what is there is prickly and uncomfortable. Still have no appetite and I'm struggling with trying to not lose more weight. Down 10 pounds since DX. Sometimes I am feeling like an odd duck while reading everyone else's posts. I am doing neo adjuvant chemo and haven't had my BMX yet. I get a new picc line each 3 week cycle instead of having a port. I am getting 4 AC'S 3 weeks apart and then 4 Taxotere /Carboplatin 3 weeks apart. And of course there's the whole flying across the country for treatment thing. Anyone doing the same??? Oh! About the icing of the hands/feet. I asked my MO about icing my hands during my last infusion and he said he was all for it. I asked the infusion nurse about it and I was brought 2 surgical gloves that had been filled with ice cubes. I held onto them off and on during the A and C drips. Not sure if it helped stave off any neuropathy, but it was easy enough to give it a try...even if the condensation was a little messy.    ",

Mouth sores are flared again. Same ones as before, so I guess they just heal 'enough' to go dormant and then get brought back after each new round. Naturopath prescribed L-glutamine powder this time.

Instead, I had my husband put in an order of DS's favorite french pastries and for a chocolate Happy Birthday plaque to stack them around. So, I'm not baking or doing the legwork, but at least I can take the credit for the idea being one that DS will absolutely love. Freaking out at having to adjust to a whole new chemo regimen after I finish AC. OH! Even better, my first Taxotere/Carbo will be the day before my Birthday. Happy Birthday TO ME!

I finished 4 rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxan and just started 4 rounds of taxotere/carboplatin last week. Wishing you the best and positive thoughts for minimal side effects. My naturopath was out today and a substitute called based on the horrible report I gave my care manager this morning. I figured it was probably going no where, since I have tried everything for my mucositis. To my surprise, there was yet another trick in the bag. Slippery Elm lozenges. They aren't lozenges so much as tablets that dissolve. They are having just the slightest bit of an effect on the inflammation....or maybe it's because I am on day 8 an it's about freaking time. Either way....right. So, if anyone out there needs another weapon for mucositis, you can get it online or send your poor DH to 2 different Whole Foods on the other side of town during rush hour to pick it up. ",

We met yet another patient tonight that was told by their droctor in their hometown that they had 6 months to live. So, they came to this hospital and that was 4+ years ago. I wish I had a dollar for each time I heard that story. This woman's hometown doctor also initially diagnosed her with breast cancer, but it was really multiple myaloma. I am so inspired by her journey. My biggest achievements this week: Monday- went to group power weightlifting class at the gym. I used to go 2-3 times a week, now it's 1x every 3 weeks. Everyone there is so inspired that I come at all. I feel like a slacker. I really hope I can go back to having weightlifting and interval training a part of my routine again. I miss the endorphens. Thursday - Only broke down crying at 1 dermatology appointment. My regular derm was so sympathetic about the BC, that it got me all emotional. I held it together for the meeting with the derm surgeon though. Good news is that I have no other dysplastic moles currently. Bad news is that the one on my ear does HAVE to be removed by excision. Everybody cross your fingers I don't end up with an elf ear! Thursday - Went refrigerator hunting with DH. Forgot I had cancer for about 30 minutes!!! Then we went cell phone shopping. Whoohoo! Got a new S6 Edge. I asked DH if it was because I had gotten cancer, he said \"No, it's because you kicked cancers ass!\" Anyway, you know how slowwww phone stores can be...we were there over 2 hours. Again, I forgot all about cancer while I played with all the new phones. I think retail therapy might win out over mind/body therapy. Now, which one is cheaper??? AND....best achievement yet? I kicked my Ativan habit!!! I haven't had one in 10 days. I had been using them for over 4 months and the anxiety of being addicted to them was really weighing on me. Not sleeping any worse or better without them. Still only getting about 5 to 6 hours, but Ativan is no longer the boss of me! 1 day until next chemo, 22 days until LAST CHEMO EVER!!!!! About 43 days until I have a wedge cut out of my ear. About 57 days until BMX. About 58 days until I stop counting down the days until unpleasant experiences and only count down days to good stuff!!! Love ya'all. Everyone take care! Those of you starting radiation this week, my thoughts are with you.    ",

Jen, sending you reassurances that it's ok. We have been through so much in such a short amount of time and we are still standing. Our breasts may have let us down, but the rest of our bodies have carried us through this \"mutant uprising\"...even when we filled it with toxic sludge and blasted it with radiation. No matter what we throw at our cells, they bounce back. Our bodies are protecting us and rebuilding us WAY more than they are attacking us. The odds that something scary is growing in the contralateral side after everything you've recently put it through are low (not impossible, but low). After seeing what our bodies are capable of, I fully put my money on your bodies ability to kick the ass of any mutants that try to step out of line! So, now that I've said all that, I acknowledge that someday (when I'm feeling a lump) I won't believe a word of it and I'll think its a bunch of crap..and I'll be scared as HELL. P.S. Is it so weird that we all jump at chance to get any doctor to feel us up?",

However, I had psychologically made up my mind to have a bmx the second the biopsy results were in. I think my brain is just wired to \"go\" there and can't wrap itself around any other decision. I have had 4 rounds of A/C, 1 round of taxotere/carboplatin (out of 4) and just had my mid point mri last week. It showed a complete radiological response. I hope you can get your mri soon so that you can feel the same relief that I did. Maybe knowing how your mass responded would help you decide what to do. I agree that it is still very overwhelming knowing that we have these big surgeries looming on the horizon. ",

It's not fair to jerk him around. They took a road trip today...had already planned it last week. So my son and I had the whole house to ourselves today! After he finished his school work, we spent all afternoon playing Monopoly. Sigh. December 1st is really far away. Sex? What's that? LOL. We tried it once back in June. Painful...brought me to tears. It's drier than the Sahara down there and no amount of KY or Astro could have helped. Haven't dared to try again - not that I felt like it. I was proud of myself last week when I checked the Sex Issues \"box\" on my side effect self-assessment at the cancer center. It was part of the survivorship program - meeting with a Nurse specialist and social worker. They are supposed to help coordinate support as the patient nears the end of treatment. I figured that checking that box meant they would bring it up. Nope. Didn't bring it up. At the end of the meeting they asked if there was anything else. So I brought it up. The male social worker blushed and spun his chair around with sudden urgency to write something down. The nurse specialist explained that they have a dedicated specialist just for SEX! Then why is there a box on YOUR form for it? They did give me a non-hormonal moisturizer to try. And gave me the speech about exploring \"other forms\" of intimacy. Okay, I'm 41 years old. Are they insinuating that I'm unaware of \"other forms\" of intimacy? Got that...but eventually I'd it all to work please! \"Use it or lose it!\" Something you don't worry about when your 18!

However, I still look at those 1mg tablets and my mouth waters. I like your 'organic' plan for getting off the Ativan. Laura.

Positive, I hope your retreat gave you all the energy you'll need for all those appointments. At least you are getting it all out of the way though. I plan to try to get whatever I can out of the way before the end of the year too...but the list seems endless. Have you started the hypothyroid treatment yet? My SSBMX DIEP surgery date is confirmed for 10/19. Last chemo follow-up yesterday leaves me officially diagnosed with Anemia. MO offered to give me a blood transfusion, but I decided to give my body more time to recover on it's own. If my bloodwork doesn't improve by pre-ops 10/16, they will transfuse me before surgery. But, MO thinks I just need a bit more time and Naturapath switched my B-Vit out with a huge dose of folate. MO and team gave us a cake at the appointment to celebrate end of chemo. I had a little sliver, DH and DS had some big slices and then we gifted the rest of the cake to another family we had seen in the elevator earlier in the day. Ear surgery goes off as scheduled Tomorrow. Nobody is worried about low platelets as there is minimal blood supply on ear ridge and they will cauterize the wound right away. Biggest issue will be pain. Tons of nerves on ear ridge. I can't believe we just flew home late last night and we leave again in 9 days. So much to do to get ready... Surgery alone is stressful.

Remember how the fit hit the shan with my parents (who had moved in while they waited for me to get better so they could continue their move across the country)....well, apparently, I am better! I know this because with less than 24 hours notice, they packed up their car (leaving quite a bit of their 'junk' behind) and hit the road. Back in September, they promised my DS that they would be here for Thanksgiving and leave on December 1st. On Sunday (11/8), they told DS that they wanted to get ahead of the winter weather and had decided to depart on 11/21. On the morning of 11/11, the announced that they decided we are all doing really well and that they wanted to get 'ahead' of some bad weather and that they were going to spend a couple of days at a local hotel to 'decompress' and then hit the road. So, on the morning of 11/12, they packed up and left. I understand that they are really excited about their new adventure and are eager to get moved, but could they at least try not to make me feel like a giant speed bump in their plans. Just as we head into the season of family and togetherness....they are gone. Happy Holidays! We head to Illinois for BS, PS, MO follow-ups on Monday, fly home Tuesday, and then DH has the rest of the week off work for Thanksgiving. We'll have Thanksgiving dinner with DH's parents and then spend the rest of the week hanging out together and NOT focusing on cancer for a change. Instead of traveling back to Illinois for Diep stage 2 surgery, we've decided to take a vacation someplace more fun and warm. We'll put off Stage 2 until closer to Spring (when it's warmer in Illinois). As much as I want the physical reconstruction to be finished, I want DH and DS to end the year having a great time and not just worrying about me in surgery....again. P.S. Still having hair envy. Although mine has started to grow, it's growing sllllllloooooowwwwwlllllyyyyy! However, I am rocking less of a 'cancer patient' look and more of a \"I just got back from a monastery in Nepal\" kinda look. So there's that!",

I also got to shed some of the rigid surgical tape. My next follow up is just before Thanksgiving. We might get to do a little background color tattoo. If I keep healing this fast, I may have a chance at getting stage 2 (some nip/tuck and fat grafting, nipple tattoo) done before the end of the year. I figured I would have to wait 3-4 months to even start the process, but I guess not. The temptation to get it all done on this years insurance OOP is soooo tempting. I ran into a friend of mine, who I met during the tornado warning a few months ago. She was nice enough to stop in and see me last week in the ICU and today she was here accompanying another woman to an endoscopy. She is one of the nicest, most caring women I have had the opportunity to come to know. If it had not been for breast cancer, I would not have met her. I wish that neither (or any) of us had breast cancer. But, given our involuntary drafting into this club, I am so thankful for having met her and all of you!  ",

They have lived there about 3 years and things got sketchy more and more about a year ago, but yet no reason to ever call police. Another neighbor reported that some kids at school said that was the house where they buy their drugs. This was reported, and police said it's hearsay and there is no evidence. Fast forward to this past March right before I was diagnosed, a patrol officer stopped by our garage sale to tell me their house was under surveillance and they thought there was sex and drug trafficking going on, but that they still didn't have enough for a warrant. He asked that I let other concerned neighbors know that we should call him with anything we observe going on. Just tonight, we sent him information about some weird stuff that was happening. Turns out there was an undercover car on the block who witnessed the same thing we did. So, tonight, we hear this huge explosion...then another and then the swat team announces we should all stay inside our houses away from the windows. WTF???? Turns out the explosions were the swat team blowing in the door and then smoking the house. 4 people in custody (1 caught after trying to run), but we don't know what they finally are charged with. Their house is still being searched. DS is freaked out...understandably. I am feeling anxious but hoping this is finally a resolution to what has been a stressful few months...on top of an already stressful few months. So glad this didn't happen when DH and I were gone to Illinois and DS was here with just his grandparents. DH is sleeping with him tonight. Guess I am taking a full dose of ativan tonight! ",

I think that the anxiety builds over time...and with neo, I've had nearly 4 months of building anxiety about BMX. I will try to remind myself that it isn't going to be as bad as my inner voice makes it out to be. Oddly enough, with 4 months to consider all my options, I still can't decide if I want reconstruction or not. It's been very beneficial to see how you and little blue have dealt with non-reconstruction. I would have never considered it before, but the idea that I can save myself from all the extra pain involved with reconstruction (and re-reconstruction if there were complications) is very tempting. However, I had originally considered using my own tissue for reconstruction, but got confused on how they make 2. Also, not sure if I even have enough tissue for even 1 diep. I definitely have decided that I am not interested in implants. I'm obviously needing another meeting with the SO. When we first met, I think I was still in dx fog la la land. Now that I am more educated and have had all this time to let the options sink in, I hope that I will be able to come to a comfortable decision. In any case, I am praying that I can relate the same news about bmx (that it's the easiest part of the process). By the by, we were woken at 6am this morning with random people ringing our doorbell trying to get information from us about what went down last night. They apparently 'knew' the people arrested and were coming to pick up their 'stuff'. DH is on the HOA board and has a contact with the PD that coordinates the undercover patrols around our common areas. He called him and they sent somone out right away, but the people had already gone in the house and then left again. The patrolwoman checked the house and said it seems secure, despite the fact that the front door was blown open and doesn't shut anymore. She also told us that there was a dog left in the house and that they (PD) don't have the authority to remove it. We are to wait 2 days and then report an abandoned dog to the humane society. ??? Two more times today, a van pulled up and started packing up furniture from the house....not sure if maybe they took the dog too? DH is waiting for a call back from PD contact to find out why we are now in charge of worrying about the abandoned dog. It turns out that the explosions we heard last night were 3 different flashbang grenades the swat team tossed into the house. I really hope it's all over now and that the house will eventually be home to a nice normal family.",

About neuropathy...I started having the pins and needles in both feet (toes and pads) and in right hand (fingers and palm) after tax/carb #1.....despite icing during infusion and taking 10g of l - glutamine 3x/day. It started on day 7 and was completely gone by tax/carb #2. This time....exactly the same...day 7, same pins and needles/same extremities. Thus round, I was also started on 400iu vitamin e to see if it worked. I can't say that it did, but I am absolutely not any worse...that is if it goes away again. At the very least, I am choosing to believe that without the icing/glutamine/vit e, it would be much worse...so I will keep at it. One positive benefit of dead taste buds? I can swish and choke down the l - glutamine in plain old water. No concern about that anymore. Katy! Congratulations on your move.

Maybe the scar tissue was suddenly pushing it closer to the skin and that's why I felt it 'suddenly'.

However, I found that I could manage relatively well if I just kept moving. I also am troubled by a feeling of weakness. We took DS on his favorite thrill rides and I found that the G-forces were too powerful for me this time. Frustrating! I know that a lot of joint pain and weakness can be normal after treatment. Since I am not on any hormonal treatments, I can only assume that I should be getting better and not worse. Since the pain is getting worse (or at least it was before I started diclofenac) this is what scares me that there is a greater problem. Right now, I am praying that all the pain will be gone after I wake up from surgery and it will leave just as mysteriously as it arrived. LITTLEblue, love the hair. It looks like it's getting some length too. Mine seems stuck at this length.

My yearly physical and first official Mammogram were still 2 weeks away. My parents were being children; arguing and dragging me into it. I was so sad and stressed out. Oh...and I was also finishing up building DS his giant spaceship play structure in the back yard. I was paranoid that our neighbors would get all uppity about it. Never in a million years, did I see the last year ahead of me. That spaceship was the least of my worries.  I've said it before, but probably not often enough, Thank you all for your support. You don't know how often you kept me company on my sleepless, anxious nights. You were all there with me as I sat in the waiting room to get my PICC lines, after I was admitted into the hospital with neutropenia, and as we sat there waiting for our flights at the airport. You've made me laugh, inspired me to get my butt to the gym, convinced me that drinking that nasty L-Glutamine was worth it, provided me with resources to figure out how to repaint my face to appear more human....this list goes on and on and on. A thousand times, Thank You ALL and I look forward to seeing many of these milestones come and go each and every year for a very long time....or at least until we are all so old that our memories fail us and we can no longer remember them. P.S. 6 month Dermatology appointment went well today. Nothing found! Yay! Also, I asked her if the little bead/lump/trouble maker felt like a surgical granuloma to her. She said that it did in fact feel like that. Since I had 2 granulomas on my DIEP scar, 1 on my new belly button, and 1 on my ear excision....I'm starting to really believe that this thing is just another sign that my body hates internal stitches. I'm like 99.99% certain that's what it is and only 0.01% freaking out that it's anything to worry about.",

So, instead of jumping to conclusions, with this Rheumi we are getting more thorough bloodwork, urine sample, DEXA scan, and ultrasound of my joints (with possible fluid biopsy). He listened sympathetically about my fear of many of the RA medications and listed off several other less scary options we could try before we jump into that pond. He agreed with the other Rheumi that there is time to wait for my post chemo body to potentially work itself out. He agrees with MO that the hormone issues could in all likelihood be attributing to the pain as well, although he thinks it unlikely to be the sole cause. He also agrees with me that all the cumulative effect of chemo, surgery (that resulted in temporary core strength atrophy - thus overuse of my upper body), chemopause, etc. are all enough to push my body and immune system over the edge. Whether or not that cliff is RA is what we have to find out. At least this Dr. is willing to do a little more leg work while we give my body time to work itself out.

      "Content": "Feb 3, 2016 03:34PM - edited Feb 3, 2016 03:35PM by DizzParkMom Sorry to keep you waiting. I was unfortunately distracted with some tense news concerning my Aunt. She was diagnosed with lung cancer just over 3 years ago. She survived the whole cancer journey and was declared NED. Well...she fell for no apparent reason over the weekend. After being taken from her local community hospital to a larger University hospital, she was diagnosed with brain mets. She has 3 lesions. She is in surgery right now getting the smaller and easier two tumors removed. When they see how strong she makes it through this smaller surgery, they will come up with the next part of the plan to deal with #3. I am heart broken for her to have to jump back into the deep end of cancer. It SUCKS! I thought of her often during my treatment and almost felt some measure of comfort that I was traveling a path that she had already 'trail blazed'. It just makes me sick to think of mets and recurrence. I had my appointment with my pcp yesterday. It made me feel both good and hostile that she wasn't as concerned with my 'lump' as I am. \"What do you mean it's only 1-2mm?\" My original tumor had to start somewhere didn't it? It didn't just appear as a 10mm lump one day. Apparently I am the one wearing the pants in our relationship, however, because she agreed that she would gladly give me my referral to get the U/S if it would put my mind at ease. From the pelvic U/S, my lady parts were all pronounced to be in good health, albeit...it actually says on the report that they are remarkably small - which means??? PCP says it's probably due to my struggling hormones. Anybody else a little unnerved that we have to live with all kinds of things being normal because it's \"PROBABLY\" due to our cancer treatment? Since her next idea to handle the pelvic floor pain is to give it some time, I believe the next item on my list is to find a good gynecologist who has experience with patients who have gone through treatment. Maybe I'll ask her about my remarkably small lady parts. ;-) Bloodwork was all good, including the R/A factors and auto-immune sedimentation rate. The joint pain could still be osteoarthritis. Oh for joy...at the age of 41. Since I am going to be back at the imaging center to for the u/s, she went ahead and wrote an order for a hand and a wrist x-ray to look for physical signs. LITTLEBLUE. Sorry to shout, but didn't want it to get lost in the rest of the msg. My advice about surgeons is to find someone with a ton of confidence no matter what direction you choose to go. I read a lot about women wanting one thing, but getting talked into something else by a surgeon who is more confident with a different procedure. Change the surgeon if that is the case, not the operation. You should be the one who gets what you want! Not your DH, not the surgeon. YOU! Check out the different reconstruction sites here on BCO. Keep a notebook for pros, cons, questions. If it comes down to traveling for reconstruction, don't let that concern you too much. I worried about the travel too much. In the end, it was the easiest part. Also, you'll read a ton of negative stuff about recuperation time after DIEP. That stuff nearly scared me away from what I really wanted. It turns out that the stronger and fitter you are going into surgery (any kind) the easier your recuperation will be. So, just because it's really hard for many people, doesn't mean it will be so hard for you.",

I still have surgery 4-5 weeks after that too. Hows the p.n.? My hands are really bothering me now. M.O. doesn't seem too concerned as I haven't had any functional issues yet, just discomfort. So many stressful cancer/non-cancer related things going on here the last few days. I was really exhausted and in a ton of pain on Saturday. I was admitedly pretty grumpy and got even grumpier over something that happened. Instead of being understanding that I was not at my best, my mother took it personally and badgered me about it. Well, I tried to let it go, but she didn't...and then I finally lost it. Just before my diagnoses, my mother threatened my father with divorce unless he agreed to move across the country to live at the beach. Well he \"agreed\" and they announced their move. I got called back for a follow-up mammogram and then scheduled for a biopsy. She flew across the country to go condo shopping the week of my biopsy, because she was certain it would be nothing. Once I got DX, I assumed they might slow down a bit and postpone their move until the dust settled. Well, they didn't. House went on the market as soon as she got back and I was told they would buy their condo, but they would stay here until I was finished with treatment. They ended up moving in with us at the end of june when their house sold. This whole time I have still been incredibly hurt and angry that they didn't even hesitate about the move. I understand that it's their life and they deserve to make their own decisions, but it still hurts. Not once in all this time have I been anything less that supportive and grateful for their help...all the while my mom's been absorbed by their impending move. So, when I say I lost it, I mean I finally expressed my hurt feelings...probably in a post-chemo fueled overly-emotional response. The last few days have gone from bad to worse and I am still struggling with SE's from this last round, I have one more round to go, and now my parents are treating me like I am the most ungrateful person on the planet. I guess since they gave me all this help, I am not allowed to feel hurt. After I told them that I wanted them to stay here when we go to Chicago for surgery (something that we already talked about last week) my dad told DH that I have stabbed them in the heart. ?? I am not asking for a free pass to be a horrible person while on chemo, but an acknowledgement that I am allowed to have a bad day without things escalating to WW3...is that unreasonable? Tonight, in a largely passive aggressive move, they announced that since I made it clear that they are unneeded anymore, and they were going to move tomorrow. When I pointed out that they were hurting my son by leaving abruptly, they reconsidered. DH assures me that all I did was just finally open up about my hurt feelings. Instead of recognizing my feelings and attempting to move past this, they've gone on the offensive and argue that I have been ungrateful and unsupportive. Pretty sure this will not end happily. Since I know that I can't control how they continue to act, I am just trying to stay as calm as I can about it and reassure my son that things will all be okay. He was devastated in March when they announced their move and has really gotten attached to them while they've lived with us. He was hurt again tonight when they threatened to leave tomorrow. Needless to say, he already had a lot on his plate worrying over me. Why did I give up Ativan? Thanks again for allowing me a place to vent and whine. So grateful to have found you all. My world has become very small, but it's reassuring to know a supportive group of ladies willing to listen to whatever I need to say. It will get better, It will get better, It will get better! ",

I have 2 spots of scar tissue on the reconstruction site on my right (non-cancer) side. During the MX, the cautery tool burned the skin from the inside all the way through to the outside. The scars were pretty nasty in the beginning, but are now just small red/hard areas. Part of my next phase of reconstruction is to excise those areas of scar tissue and create much 'nicer', less noticeable scars. So, if they can do that, I don't see any reason why they wouldn't excise this other lump. I heard back from them this morning and the P.S. and S.O. are requesting the u/s images so they can evaluate the urgency and come up with a plan. I am actually really puzzled by my ability to stay rather calm during this whole ordeal. I was a complete wreck between my repeat mammo, u/s and biopsy last year. All I could do was dwell on all the what if's and why's. This time, I've been keeping myself busy finishing up a room renovation we were supposed to work on last Spring before my DX. After DX, they whole project got ash canned. I wasn't about to let this little lump sabotage my DIY project again. I've also been focused on my Aunt. She had her 3rd brain tumor operated on Monday night. They think she'll be transferred closer to her home in order to get radiation. I don't know much about what the doctors are saying about her prognosis, but I do think it's a good sign that they are being very aggressive with her treatment. If there was no hope, I'm assuming that they wouldn't have put her through 2 separate brain surgeries in 1 week. Anyway...If my surgical team reviews my u/s images and decides that it's okay for me to keep the surgery date the same, I think I am okay with that. My other option is to go to the surgeon I saw her after my original diagnosis. However, I doubt she could give me a surgery date much closer than my current one. When we saw her last year, she was scheduling 2-3 weeks out if we decided to have her do bmx. At the time, I was like \"hell no!\" I'm not waiting that long. That's how we ended up in Illinois. Thanks for everyone's positive thoughts. I really appreciate them. I just hope that a few weeks from now, I can let you all know the good news...that this tiny, little trouble maker was nothing.",

There are lots of options. Take care. Steph, hang in there. In a week, your scans will show that you're okay. Positive thoughts! We are being held hostage by our new dog. Poor thing is so high maintenance from seperation anxiety we are afraid to leave her alone for long. I hope she adapts to us soon.  ",

At the very least, it will allow you to keep your sanity during those hour long treatments. This is definately not the time to tough it out. I just started amitriptyline at night to help me sleep. I've been resisting takingvanything since I stopped ativan last summer. What I learned is that I just made my problem worse by trying to tough it out. I assumed it would just work itself out eventually. I totally wish I had tried it earlier. If your instincts tell you you'll need a little medical support to get you through those 3 1/2 weeks....go for it. AND...I know you are scared about the surgery prospects, but I wouldn't even think or worry about that part right now. Get past this bumpy road before you start worrying about the road conditions ahead. Take Care!!!!",

What would I tell myself one year ago? I would tell myself that the letter from the radiologist about redoing my mammogram isn't just an annoying formality. I would tell myself to speak up and demand that they get me back in sooner and refuse to wait over 2 weeks for my biopsy. I would tell myself that, although it's a truly terrifying experience, I am strong enough to get through the gauntlet. Yes, the idea was unimaginable, but unimaginable things happen everyday. Lastly, I would get bone xrays and bone density scans done before treatment so I could have a clearer idea about how much chemo changed me physically. Oh...one more. I would tell myslef to enjoy the heck out of food before chemo took it all away!!!",

Having both on all the time just makes me claustrophobic. Today I am being bad and not wearing either. Gasp! I'll get back on it tomorrow, but it's nice to be able to breath again. The heat here also makes it very uncomfortable to wear the compression layers. I'm not too concerned since most of the swelling is long gone. I'm only noticing the lumps and bumps of scar tissue forming at the grafting sites, which I read is normal. My thighs are the most uncomfortable. Also, the area just under my breast between my ribs...the skin has that tugging feeling when I walk around (like after stage 1). It's not bad enough to hunch over, but annoying. I'm having a bit of an issue regaining strength too. I was cleared to walk for first 2 weeks, lift under 10 pounds until week 4 (challenging sticking to that), and then I'm allowed to do what I want and am able to do. My P.S. isn't very restrictive at all. Which is good, because I have a hard time following orders. ;-)",

I felt fortunate for being able to celebrate the holidays with my boys and that I had the strength to make it through the last year.

If I had any plans to wash/brush my hair today, I would post a picture of my similar fauxhawk...it just seems to look better than my other style (10 y.o. boy with bed head). Lol, though, everyone at the gym thinks I am just trying to look punk and tough. Nope, I just got limited options. I am amazed that it has grown out as much as it has in the last month. I'll take fauxhawk over monk any day of the week. I had an appt with my pcp on Wednesday. I've had increasing pain in my joints (particularly my hands) and am still struggling with several other side effects from treatment. I've read that sometimes auto immune problems can be common after chemotherapy. I really hope that my pcp can do something whatever the problem is. So, I had bloodwork done yesterday, I go for a pelvic u/s next week (at the same office where I had my mammogram), and am waiting for a colonoscopy referal. OH JOY!!! I'm also still sceduled to travel for more reconstruction in March. Hopefully el nino will warm things back up in Illinois by then....actually, I hope it warms up long before then for all of you living in the blizzard/ice zone. I am trying not to let my painful joints and other problems slow me down...especially when everyone keeps telling me \"how great I look now that 2015 is behind me.\" Cause all it takes is a turn of the calendar...right. 😉",

Normally we fly Sunday and get chemo on Monday, but MO is off today and he doesn't like to use PA if he can avoid it.  I really wish I had been on the every other week schedule so that I would be further along. My son's piano and voice recital is October 24th and I think I may miss it due to timing of bmx. He's playing/singing Thriller. It's going to be fabulously epic and I might miss it. Chemo doesn't even end until mid September. Surgery might be mid October at the soonest. Anyone know how long it will take me to heal enough after bmx to get on a 1500 mile, 3h 45m flight? Delaying until after recital might be possible, but this Arizona girl is getting nervous about Northern Illinois in November. I know....get over it. Supplements...A naturopath and nutritionist are part of my treatment team. They have me on Mitaki Mushroom extract, L-Carnitine, CO-Q10, Super B Complex, D3, Calcium, Fish Oil and Melatonin. I already took the d3, Super B, Calcium, and fish oil before DX, but they would have been added if not. I have been reading about the glutimine and plan to ask them about that this time. However, I agree that my SMTWTFS organizer is already quite full...especially once the nausea starts rolling and in addition to the nausea meds, constipation meds, Claritin for the neulasta, and Ativan to help me sleep...but wait there's more. I got medi-honey for throat and mouth sores that flair during days 1-10, and hydrocodon sitting at the ready for pain just in case. Avoiding that one for obvious reasons. I hope everyone getting their treatments this week gets the rest and comfort we all deserve. Thanks for being \"here\".  ",

Good day for surgery I guess. I hope it isn't too bad and that your recovery is easy. Hope you are having an awesome time in Vegas Andea. I am glad to hear about your good test results. I've heard back from pcp about my hand x-rays. Results are: troubling signs of both osteoarthritis and osteopenia. She's putting in a rheumatology referral for after my surgery. From what I read online, however, osteoarthitis would be more likely if the pain came on during the day after activity. I am actually in most pain when I wake up in the morning. I can hardly get out of bed and when I do, it's the Frankenstein shuffle for the first 20-30 minutes or so. It's all coming on suddenly in my hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. 6 weeks ago, I treked all over Disneyland morning to night in chilly weather. I didn't have any of this joint pain. It was only after the first of the year that it started coming on bit by bit. Of course, Dr. Google has diagnosed me with everything...including: Gabapentin insensitivity, Estrogen depletion causing cartilage loss, celiac sensitivity, Fibromyalgia, and Rheumatoid Arthritis, Leukemia...just to name a few. Between the trouble maker lump, my surgery, and this joint pain, it feels like I am being sucked back into the cancer bubble. I don't want to go back into the bubble. I was just getting used to being back in the real world. I have so many side effects stacking up, I can't even keep track. Once again, thanks for listening. Venting to someone who understands my fears and frustration is helpful.  ",

It will take 6-8 weeks for Plaquinil to build up in my system and potentially diminish my symptoms. \"IF\", the symptoms go away, I'll stay on the Plaquinil for about 6 months and then slowly reduce the dosage while seeing if the pain returns. If it doesn't, hooray! If it does, I'll be back on the med for another 6 months before we try to reduce it again. Sigh! At least it was a fairly cheap prescription. Oh, and the DEXA scan confirms osteopenia at -2.3 and 10 year fracture risk is only 3%, so I shouldn't need meds for that and hopefully the bone density will improve as I get further out from chemo.",

The main jist seemed to be that early stage breast cancers are over treated. Since when is how aggressive a woman is treating her breast cancer the business of anyone besides her and her doctors. This one size fits all attitude like the American Cancer Society saying to wait until you are 45 for a mammogram is a real danger to women. Having my 40 y.o. baseline mammogram on time and finding a doctor who was willing to treat me aggressively is the reason why I am confident that I have beaten this disease. On that note, I am going to get discharged from hospital today. My M.O. saw my surgical pathology cross his desk and came to find me this morning. Official word is Complete Pathological Response and no evidence of any disease in sentinel nodes. I am so glad he came to give me the news...I wasn't looking forward to waiting until next week. My Diep donor site proves to be the greatest source of trouble. My old favorite chemo side effect 'C' followed by 'D' has kept me up and down since 1pm yesterday. New flap boobs have great circulation, so I shouldn't have to worry to much about flap problems. They still feel like frankenboobs. The numbness is unnerving. The drains are the pits. Boobs drains come out here on monday, so we will stay at least until Tuesday. The tummy drain already looks like it will come out sooner rather than later... DH, son and I might just stay another week if they think it will be that quick. It's cheaper to stay in one of the subsidized hotels than it is to fly round trip again. After 10 trips, all the points the in-laws let us use are about gone. Rehab is very confident that I should have no problems with lymph edema based on just the 3 nodes they removed...I hope they are right. So no glove or sleeve needed to fly home. I am so happy to be so close to the finish line. I know that by 11/7, at my son's piano recital I will be ready to step over the line that seemed so far away last April.

I am way ahead of schedule so far....surgical team is happy with the results so far. All good progress. Follow up is in late November. Next spring, I will need a little fat grafting done to fill in a little of the upper poles, get a little nip/tuck to clean up the aesthetics, and then I get to decide about nipples...surgical or tattoo. I am leaning toward tattoo. Medically, I am still technically anemic and apparently only time will help the numbers, but I feel way better than I did 2 weeks ago. I am amazed how fast things are going now compared to slow chemo time. Today is 6 weeks pfc. I would love to celebrate by showing off my hair....but I still don't have any to show off.",

First got sent to MO office nurse then got sent to care manager for surgery team. I sent pics with a dot on the spot and described what I am feeling to them. Their first gut instinct is that it is 'necrotic tissue'...fat necrosis to you and me. I askes them how confident they are and the likelyhood that it is actually something to be concerned with and they said \"very very low.\" They said since I am scheduled to for stage 2 surgery in about 5 weeks, they will plan on excising the area at the same time. My other option is to go through my local pcp, get an u/s, go to a local surgeon if it is questionable for excision/biopsy. I am actually feeling pretty calm about it today. Based on everything I have read and what they said, it does seem highly probable that it is fat necrosis. Am I crazy to wait 5 weeks for them to investigate it? I was told to feel is no more than 1x/week and keep the dot on top of it. If I notice any change at all (even if I think its in my imagination) they will re-evaluate. Another option they gave me was to fly to illinois for an exam, u/s, excision biopsy next week. It seems a little drastic for something that is highly probable to be fat necrosis. My pcp did a ton of bloodwork when I saw her about my joint pain last week and I have my pelvic u/s scheduled for Wednesday. So, I figured she will probably call me Friday or next Monday to go over the tests. I figured I will go over the 'lump' then and ask if she wants to 'feel me up'. I am just trying to develop a rational attitude about 'lumps'. I am not ignoring it, but not freaking out. For now.  ",

Anyway, pcp said we would use the pelvic pain as a reason to get a good look at the overies and makensure there isn't anything else to be worried about. So, I was called back today by the same woman who did my breast u/s last March. I told her I was grateful to her and the mammogram tech for spotting my tumor. It was kind of emotional talking about the last year, but I am glad I got the chance to say thank you to them. I explained the pain I was having and she told me she would be very gentle. She was. As much as I am wanting to resolve the pain I am having, I hope that she didn't find anything wrong. My bloodwork came back normal. No arthritis. That's a good thing, but why the hell all the joint pain...? I also asked the u/s tech about the fat necrosis and if an u/s would actually tell her if it that's what it was. She said usually. I told her that I may be back next week if I decide I can't handle the waiting. Now that I have talked with her, I am very tempted to call pcp and get a u/s referral...then I don't have to think about it anymore. I'm not worried so much as it's just on my mind.",

Anyway, we also needed to run by the health food market for snacks for our upcoming trip. In between, we decided to squeeze in lunch at a fast food place. Nothing like chowing down on a burger between the gym and the health food store....right. Okay...I am so far from the main idea here, it's embarassing. Just as we got out of the car, this older guy looks at DS and says \"What? No school today?\" DS looked at me as if to say...ack! stranger danger mom. I jumped in and said, \"we homeschool, thank you\" and then we kept on walking. He then asks DS if he knows his times tables and can he tell him what 6x9 is. DS stared back at the man blankly. I attempted to laugh it off as if the guy couldn't possibly think that giving my son a math test in a parking lot was appropriate. Then, the guy starts lecturing us about how important it is for ds to know his times tables like his birthdate. I looked at the guy and said that as it's not appropriate for children to talk to strangers, he wouldn't get a reply to that question either. We turned and kept walking to the door. As I looked back, the man was still standing there shaking his head. WTF? I chomped back by desire to go off on him big time and instead yelled back \"Don't judge! Maybe I can come quiz your children.\" Where does he get off. He doesn't know anything about us or my ds's academic abilities or disabilities for that matter. What a JERK! It's non of his business what my son knows, doesn't know, or if he can perform his times tables like a monkey in a parking lot. Does he hang out in public school parking lots and quiz children as they leave for the day? His tax money isn't paying for my son's homeschool education. It's non of his business. I also couldn't help noticing that this guy's car was parked in a handicapp space....but since it wasn't any of my business what his need to park there entailed, I didn't harass him about it.

Saw a rheum. a couple weeks ago. After a 10 minute exam she was ready to DX me with Rheumatoid Arthritis because the pain is worse in the AM and there is signs of osteopenia in my finger joints. Never mind that my blood work was negative...she says its something called seronegative RA...if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then its a duck - even if it doesn't have the dna of a duck. She wasn't at all intesrested in my cancer journey, treatments, side effects, etc. She sent me for more bloodwork, but already started talking about putting me on plaquinil or methotrexate. Needless to say, I have an appointment in a couple weeks with a different Rheum. and won't do anything until following up with MO. My hands are no longer balled up into fists in the morning because I've been sleeping in wrist splints, but they are still stiff and sore. I'm not nearly as sore everywhere else...no more frankenstein shuffle to the bathroom in the morning. I think that jumping onto some expensive, side-effect prone medications without knowing for sure that I have RA would be a big mistake. Speaking of MO...I fly to Illinois (this time all by my lonesome) again in a couple of weeks. I have an appt for accupuncture, a colonoscopy, f/u with P.S., and check up with M/O. Not exactly a spa weekend.😐 Got my first haircut to take care of a developing mullet situation. I was very excited beforehand, but after I was dissapointed. I think I was expecting a miracle.Hope all is well with everyone else! Renee...it's like a 100 degrees here today. I will gladly bring some heat with me and leave it behind when I come to Illinois.

When do you find out about your mri? When is your next oncology/surgical/rads follow-up? Any recent bloodwork? Try to tell yourself that 'until proven otherwise' you are okay and you are going to be okay. Speak up about your aches and pains...don't explain them away - let your team investigate them. If they don't want to investigate something, find someone who will. Good job following up with the liver mri and mammogram. Remind yourself you are doing what you need to do to stay on top of things. Anxiety is normal, but don't let it control you. Remember what we fought through last year. You are strong and brave and can get through all these tests and waiting too. P.S. I'm saying all this as much to myself as I am to you. My MRI follow up is tomorrow morning and I am nervous too. I keep trying to remember that if something is found, there will be plenty of worry to be done at that time...no need to borrow any today.",

As far as results, you'll get a good idea of what you are dealing with once the swelling goes away. However, from what I understand, there are many factors from then on that determine how much of the fat sticks around and how much reabsorbs or dies. Some women are told not to do anything other than walk for 6 weeks. No jogging, no lifting, nothing that messes with body composition for six loooonnnngggg weeks. My P.S. was a little more lenient and said nothing for 2 weeks and then no high intensity stuff (like I'm able to do that anymore?) and very light on the weights until 4 week check up. All restrictions were lifted at 6 weeks. Trying to figure it out online is confusing. I'm at about the 7-8 week mark. All swelling is long gone and I can see areas where the fat obviously filled in some 'divots' and other areas that were once swollen, but are now hollow again. When I saw P.S. a couple weeks ago, he was able to tell me that I'm most likely in for at least 1 more round of fat grafting, potentially 2. I'm glad that you aren't hurting too much. If you end up needing another graft, you won't have a horrible memory to look back on.",

However, this makes me feel better about all the kalamata olives I graze from the fridge. Same thing about Avocado oil. So those chips I bought made with Avocado oil are good for me.....okay, maybe not. But I feel better and less deprived having my weekly PB&J date with DS each week. Once a week we've always had a weekly PB&J date. When it's cool enough, we pack it up in a picnic and head to the park. Since we've 'cleaned' up our pantry, now it's natural peanut butter and non-HFCS Jelly on whole grain bread), kettle potato chips fried in avocado oil, carrot sticks, and chocolate avocado brownies.  So 15 months ago, we lost both our dog and our cat to old age (16 and 20). Six weeks later, I had BC DX and it seemed like the universe was just crapping all over us. Eventually, we realized how much easier our lives were (dealing with BC treatment) without nursing our senior animals. Every once in a while we'd get an emotional pull that made us want to get another dog, but mostly, we've enjoyed being able to travel and run around town without worrying about the animals waiting for us back at home. So, last week, we had a few days of Springish weather and everyone was walking their dogs around the park. In a moment of weakness, I asked DH if it was time to think about adopting another dog. To my surprise, he was all over the idea and so was DS. Well...like a snowball rolling down hill, this idea hit it's momentum pretty fast and now I introduce you all to LIZZIE!  Ya'll! Don't get me wrong, she's super sweet and such a good girl, but WHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING! We were so free. We could stay out all day and go anywhere we wanted on a moments notice and now we're all tied down again. DS loves her. She slept all snuggled up to him last night. He's been having so much trouble sleeping since my DX and is always wanting DH to sleep in his room with him. So, maybe this will help DS feel less alone at night and improve his sleeping. DH has been feeling a little bit of what I've been feeling too, but we are both animal people and so that emotional tug is just too much for us. We feel so guilty feeling any regret for deciding to get a dog. So, we now have a dog again. We're going to get her acclimated to our local animal boarding/doggy daycare facility right away. Since she's young and healthy, she shouldn't be as much work. It's not like with our senior animals (bladder problems, medications for chronic illnesses, etc). It was hard and expensive finding places to watch them when we were away. Fortunately, so far, she's quite a couch potato and sleeps in quite late. We'll see how long that lasts. Our biggest issues are that she only wants to eat dog food if we feed it to her by hand and she broke out of 2 crates yesterday while we tried to introduce crate training. Apparently crate training isn't happening. Poor dog was abandoned in an apartment with 14 other dogs (6 of them were her nursing puppies). The Humane Society took them in early April. The puppies were taken from her early last week after they were weaned and then placed into foster care until they're old enough to be put up for adoption. She was spayed on Wednesday and we found and adopted her on Friday. She's had one hell of a Spring. I hope we can help her feel more secure and part of our family. ",

I had thought about that initially when we thought about traveling, but it slipped to the back burner while my mind has been on chemo. I'll make sure to add the precaution to my lost of things to talk to the surgeon about. Sue, yes and no. I initially picked ctca because I didn't like prior experiences I have had in several Phoenix hospitals AND because a close family friend went to ctca for colon cancer treatment and highly recommend it. (This being after he had some really horrible experiences at the same hospitals I didn't like.) When we made our first trip to ctca, I could not have been happier with the level of compassionate care I received from literally everyone we interacted with. On top of that, the MO I was assigned to (who had just joined ctca as an MO and as head of their clinical research program) was not only highly experienced in triple negative, but also went above and beyond establishing a bond with me as a person. He, and all of ctca, really commit to the mind & body philosophy and that really convinced me that ctca was where I needed to be. NOW for the NO part of the answer. Dragging myself 1500 miles from home (and my 11 y.o. ds) every 3 weeks is taking its toll on me emotionally. Just as the tsa lady who witnessed my breakdown over the sheer thought of what it will be like to fly 4 more times after this for chemo, for surgery, for x number of check ups and tests for the next x years. There is no doubt that I am making a hard situation harder by traveling to ctca for treatment. That said, I won't trade my MO for the convenience of not traveling. At least not yet.  ",

I was started on broad spectrum antibiotics while the blood work and cultures were processed and then monitored for other signs of infection. They did say that more than half the time the fever is not caused by an infection, but knowing that is impossible without the blood work. However, after being hospitalized the first time for neutropenia....the doctors (mo and pcp) let me treat round 2 fever at home while we awaited the bloodwork and cultures...even though I was neutropenic again. Round 3...no fever. Apparently my neutrophils have gotten their act together! ;-)",

I hope that your antibiotic treatment goes smoothly and that this detour is quickly a thing of the past. HI everyone else. I had my first taxotere/Carbo last Monday. Neulasta on body inection went off late Tuesday night. When they say it beeps and flashes...yes...it's loud and noticeable. Really glad we postponed it the time before when it would have gone off on the airplane. As for the transition from A/C to T/carb...I am just mentally and physically discouraged. My mouth condition had slowly deteriorated throughout A/C, and it seems like T/carb has shown me that it could get a whole lot worse. I feel as though I have been chemically burned from the inside. My whole ENT area, mouth, esophagus is just perpetually aflame. My inner ears burned and itched so badly yesterday I could barely stand it. Not only are my taste buds toasted, but my salivatory glands are all but shut down. my nose septum burns and feels raw. I can barely swallow, can't talk, can barely manage fluids/smoothies. I am assuming that the horrendous bone/whole torso pain I was in was a combo of the taxotere/neulasta. I had thus far avoided the hydrocodon the MO prescribed me for neulasta pain during A/C....but by 9am on Wednesday I could not tolerate the pain any more. After a couple of days of barely managed relief with the hydrocodon, I of course ended up with big time C. So I spent yesterday dealing with the pain of waiting for the lactulose to work. The last 4 days have been a nightmare of pain, pain, and more pain. Today, I am manageable with the body pains, but the mucositis issues are unrelenting. It is so frustrating to have done everything I could to prevent the mouth issues only to have them be the greatest source misery. I even choked down the chalky glutamine in plain water hoping for the best results. At this point I am afraid I will not have the strength to \"do this\" 3 more times. Each day, I pray I will awaken with more strength and fewer side effects.   ",

They said it came back as a benign sample with abnormal characteristics....???? So it was sent to another lab for more staining/testing. What the heck? Why couldn't it have just been simple? Does it seem normal to assume that the chemo in my skin cells confused the pathology?",

In the beginning, I was 100% BMX with tissue reconstruction. In the Middle, I was so tired I just wanted BMX with no reconstruction. Here at he end of treatment, I find myself less emotional and starting to really figure out the best choice for the long haul that isn't completely based on a knee jerk emotional reaction. So where do I find myself? NO FREAKING CLUE? P.S. is going to start precertification with insurance as a BMX. I am also worried about the possibility of them (insurance) denying the contralateral side...and having to cover half? of a BMX. Anybody else have insurance that says in the benefit book that contralateral side isn't covered, but is covered if they are pressed by the S.O.? Jen, some info from my consult in case it makes you feel better. She said that with the contralateral bmx, all but 2-5% is removed. So only that 2-5% remaining breast tissue could form a new tumor AND even with triple negative, our overall rate for a new, seperate tumor is the same as any other woman out there. 1 in 8 for any type, and then 10-20% of those are triple neg. So it seems like the odds of a new tumor on the contralateral side hae got to be so so small...obviously not impossible, but so very small. Plus, you just finished chemo. I hope the extra info makes it that much easier to relax tonight.  ",

I have also had way more weakness and fatigue...I slept or laid around in Chemo fog from Wednesday until nearly today. I managed to take a long Epsom salt bath this morning in an attempt to detox some of the chemo sludge. My muscles are so tight and weak...I am having a hard time imagining functioning normally. I haven't taken the gabapentin for the p.n. yet...after I got freaked out by reading about the side effects. I will reassess depending on how bad the neuropathy pain gets. Soooo glad there isn't any more chemo to come. I honestly could not handle anymore. 15 days until we meet with p.s. and have to decide on reconstruction surgery (skin sparing, implant vs tissue, or NONE). 18 days until my ear surgery...it was easy to decide about reconstruction for my ear. NORMALish NON-ELF EAR PLEASE!!! I have no hair to hide it. BMX could be one month from Monday. I so wish I was on the other side of all this. I can't take all the waiting anymore! Everyone thinks I've got all the time in the world to relax and 'heal'. I don't think that can happen until I am on the other side of ALL the hurdles.",

We go back 10/4 to meet with SO, P.S., and MO and get post Chemo MRI (oh joy!) and come home on 10/6. Then, I think we go back 10/15 so that we can get pre-ops done the Friday before Surgery.

Usually this last stage sticks around until time to get the next round of chemo and then it all starts over.

Original plan was to get the guided wire dealy in the morning before surgery like the do during lumpectomy, but radiology thinks the lump may be smaller than the wire. P. Surgeon thinks he will just be able to remove it without wire since it is so close to skin. He is 100% not concerned that it is anything to worry about (i.e. recurrence), but agrees that taking it out and knowing exactly what it is is necessary. Likely suspects are granuloma, something to do with cartilage that was removed during diep to make room for transplanted vessel, oddly presented scar tissue (beadlike) or fat necrosis that has hardened . So far, 2 radiologists, 2 u/s techs, 1 pcp, and 1 plastic surgeon can't i.d. what it is based on feel or u/s, so I feel better that I didn't have a clue. Jpint pain...suspects are a) hormonal/ menopausal, b) allergy to food group or supplement that my body suddenly doesn't agree with, c) muscle atrophy from treatment (could also help explain pelvic pain and constipation ). Osteoarthritis in every joint in my body or auto-immune reaction is the least popular suspect. I'm getting a vitamin c infusion tonight to combat lingering fatigue and give me a boost going into surgery. Being back on the infusion floor for a 3 hour infusion is making me have a ptsd reaction. I am all tense and sweaty. The smell is nauseating. Maybe this was a bad idea.",

Evidently, there were some skin cells embeded in the diep flap that had formed into a cyst after transfer. It should be an isolated occurance and shouldn't grow back. Very relieved. Now, I just wish I could get past the pain from surgery and the overwhelming fear that the joint pain is a symptom of something more worrisome. Off to bother pcp about that rheumatology referral. Thanks so much to all of you who kept me company on the lump rollercoaster. Scarlett, I feel like I could have written your post. Although not as uncomfortable as the initial surgery, I feel like I completely misjudged the significance of this part of the process. My fat grafting areas encompass my upper and lower abdomen, flanks, and outer/back thigh. The bruising and soreness seems to have peaked, so I hope it turns a corner any minute now. My scar revisions aren't nearly as bothersome, however the edges of my dog ear revisions have started to ache a bit. I suppose the nerves in that area weren't as damaged during diep and can actually feel the wound. Psychologically, it feels like I'm going through another round of treatment versus recovering from a surgery. I can't wait for my mind to shake that feeling. I really hope the next 2-3 weeks will speed by for both of us.",

About my mouth issues, my suggestion would be to never stop complaining to MO team. There are always more tricks in the bag to try....don't just try one and wait until the next treatment to tell them if it didn't help. Sometimes what works for everyone else, doesn't work for you and they have to dig deeper into the bag if tricks.",

It doesn't really have any affect on how I function, so I don't think about it often. The joint pain, however, is still an every minute of every day issue. I've been in physical therapy about 8 weeks now to rebuild lost muscle tone and address some internal rotation on my left side. I started plaquinil (an RA) drug on May 9th despite a non-RA diagnosis because of the synovial fluid in my fingers. M.O. ordered a food antibody bloodtest to see if I may have developed food intolerances. It may be that my gut was just as 'burned' up as my mouth was during chemo. A leaky gut is frequently associated with multiple food intolerances and also with many auto-immune diseases. Long story short...I am on an elimination diet from all the foods my blood showed an antibody response to....wheat, corn, rice, oat, tomato, cow's milk, egg, peanut, walnut, almond, cane sugar, canola oil, black/white/green/cayenne pepper...plus 15 other things. And, everything else has to be eaten on a 4 day rotating schedule....eat an apple today, no more apples until Tuesday. Yes, food sucks again this summer. It sucked last summer. It all sucks. Sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks, sucks. I may supposedly be able to return some of the list to my diet eventually as it is most likely only 1 or 2 foods responsible for the joint pain. In the meantime, my gut gets a break and I am nourishing it with L-Glutamine again to try to strengthen it. Sometimes, I just daydream about eating a giant chocolate cake like a 1 year old and washing it down with a huge, cold glass of milk. And then I go back to eating my dry coconut flax-bread with black eyed peas and cauliflower rice. So if anybody has any grain free, dairy free, egg free, sugar free, pepper free.....recipes, send them my way. Fran, it sound like an awesome birthday party with some amazing friends. So glad you were able to finish out the school year as you wished. Even though it's hard being in limbo about treatment, you have the right idea about taking things day by day. The future may be stressful enough, no need to ruin today fretting about it. Lynne, good luck with the job hunt after vacation. So excited to read about your annual family trip to Maine. I remember reading about your trip last year and how you had to take a break during it for a chemo treatment. I was amazed how enthusiastic and energetic you were still able to be. I hope you have an amazing time this year!!! And let me know if any of those side effects magically disappear at the 1 year mark. 😉 I guess we can all hope. Right? ",

I'm using liquid aminos in place of soy sauce (contains wheat) probably every other day and garlic, cinnamon, and mustard are the only tools in my arsenal to obtain any spice to anything at all. I'm thinking of experimenting with wasabi or horseradish. I made a great homemade cereal today out of puffed millet, cinnamon, maple syrup, and a sprinkle of coconut sugar....even though my coconut day isn't until Monday. Almond milk is out unfortunately, but coconut milk isn't too bad. I also can't have cashew milk, because every brand I have found contains almonds in addition to the cashews. I am allowed a certain amount of soy, so I use a little soy milk and soy yogurt...which causes me to cheat on cane sugar. Cane sugar has been the hardest thing to eliminate, not because I'm dead set on eating sweets, but because it's freaking everywhere and in everything. I'd love any and all recipes you've got that might fit the diet and be new and different from what I'm doing. Today's lunch: kale and quinoa tots held together with chia/flax egg. Not too bad when I dip them in my hearts of palm/garlic dip. I'd rather be eating a turkey sandwich on whole grain wheat bread with a slice of provalone!!! ",

I still abhor the idea of waiting to hear back from the clinic on my next step, but at least the ball is rolling. Since the biopsy on Monday, I was in a constant panic of \"What if I have cancer?, I can't have cancer!, Please don't let me have cancer!\" This morning...I woke up and the first words on my lips were \"I have CANCER!\" It's not a fear or an uncertainty anymore. It's a reality. It's here. It's inside me. I fear what it's in there doing. Is it growing? Is it invading? I'm already certain that I want a complete bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction. I have always hated my breasts. When I was a little girl, I hated the ever increasing protrusion of my nipples. I was teased in 4th and 5th grade. I hated wearing my training bra. It itched and chaffed and always seemed to 'show' under my clothes anyway. I was teased about wearing a bra. I watched my older sister as she exuded such confidence in her blooming shape. Boy did she bloom. My 'blooming', on the other hand, stalled not soon after my development began and I've been an A cup ever since....well at least one of them filled out an A cup. There's always been a little extra room in the A cup of my right breast. By high school, I was teased again for being so flat-chested. When my son was born 10 years ago, and my breasts filled with milk, I was almost a B cup for the first time in my life. Between filling out my maternity bra and breast-feeding my son, I began to have a better appreciated for my breasts. Maybe they weren't so bad after all. I had to return to work when my son was about 6 weeks old and had to switch to a breast pump. Apparently, my breasts didn't like that and my milk dried up prematurely. Slowly, they shriveled back to their original size.. perhaps a little more saggy and less plump...and covered in stretch marks. As I've gotten more into fitness, I've come to appreciate how handy it's been not to deal with large bussoms getting in my way. On vacations, I relished in the idea that I could easily rock a cute halter top without any concern of spilling out/over. Lately, I've even gotten more and more into bra shopping. Living with my husband and adolescent son, going shopping by myself is one of the 'girly' things I do when the testosterone level in the house gets overbearing. I used to hate the padded, under wire supported A cups I would come across. I felt like a fraud wearing them. I would gravitate to a tight fitting one 'size' fits all sports type bra. In the last couple of years I've come to appreciate a more feminine padded a-cup. I found a beautiful satin bra with a sexy criss-cross detail in the front. I liked it so much, I went back a few months ago and bout 3 more in different colors. I was finally starting to look in the mirror and see a sexy, \"voluptuous\" appearing woman staring back at me. I felt good. And now.....I hate my breasts. They have let me down and are threatening my life. If getting a complete mastectomy can help me feel even just slightly safer and more secure in my prognosis then I am all for it. I would do it today if I could. ",

I live in Phoenix and traveled to the CTCA in Zion, IL. It does seem like a long haul for treatment, but it worked out for us, so there it is. About the stairs...I told the Physical therapist who came to help me walk around that I was worried about stairs. She propped open a stairwell door and said, \"well, let's see how you do.\" It was a piece of cake. No worse than walking. The irritating part was the wires and tubes I was chained to...they limited me to about 3 steps. I was easily climbing 2 flights of stairs at the hotel 11 days after surgery. Also, don't worry about the bathroom and hygine issues...it wasn't a problem for me and probably won't be for you. I did have to have help getting out of bed everytime because of needing to be unhooked from so many monitors. Then, it was awkward using the restoom while the nurses and techs literally have their ear to the door just incase you need help. I was worried about all that too and all the worry ended up being a waste of my energy. I think the kidney aurgery you had was more invasive eventhough itvwas laproscopic. They were actually cutting through many more layers into your abdominal cavity. In this surgery, it's much more 'on the surface'....the skin, fascia, fat...etc. There is some digging around in the muscle to get at the bloodflow, but hopefully no removal or full dissection of the muscle. Don't get me wrong, it is still one heck of a surgery, but not necessarily worse than your kidney surgery. How did your appointments go? ",

I have done a little research on this and other websites over the last 2 weeks while awaiting the biopsy, so I am looking back over my notes now. It's horrible.

Holy cow there are like 10,000 films in that thing. I also saw some papers stacked on top of the film. I slid them out of the envelope, but assumed they were the same incomplete reports that I have already seen. NOPE! It was the actual complete pathology report from the lab that did the tests and not just the faxed summery that they sent to the radiologist. So...I have more information and I am even more scared than I was before. In addition to IDC Grade 3...now I know that it is ER- and PR-.

I've gotten me a nice big prescription for some klonipin that should at least keep me sleeping some at night. She was more interested in hearing about how I was doing emotionally and what she could do to help me with that than going over the pathology report. Basically, that was just handed to me on the way out of the office with the prescription. I'm not upset with that, but I guess I would have liked a little more of an explanation. The report says: The final pathologic diagnosis is invasive ductal carcinoma, high-grade (grade 3/3), with extension to surrounding adipose tissue. No definitive lymphovascular invasion is identified. Desmoplastic response and marked lymphocytic response. I understand what IDC means and I also know what grade 3 is. Beyond that...??? I'm stuck on the grade 3 part. This means that the cancer cells are dividing quickly right. So my impulse is get this BOOB off ASAP!!!! My physicians office already had scheduled me with a local breast surgeon for Monday afternoon. CTCA is working on getting us flown to Illinois on Sunday 4/19. I'm going to at least meet with the local surgeon to hear how swiftly things can progress here locally. If it sounds like CTCA is a better option, then that's what we'll do. CTCA says that surgery could be as soon as 4/23 if that's the route that's best to take. I've always been a quiet mouse, but I feel like I need to morph into a fire breathing dragon to face this challenge. Fear is a powerful emotion. Normal everyday things often cause me to feel afraid. Do people like me? Why don't I have close friends? Am I doing a good job as a mom? Will the cashier at the grocery store hate me for using too many coupons? At the same time...I've gone sky diving, I've miscarried one baby, I've lost another baby at birth and almost died of sepsis afterward, I've had skin cancer carved out of my face, and now I'm on the road to being a Breast Cancer Survivor. Maybe it is time I stop fearing the everyday and feeling like a mouse. It's time to stare cancer down and knock it out. Do you hear me CANCER? I'm coming for you! Okay.....anybody buying it? I'm not sure I am this strong yet, but I am sure going to get there!  Again...Thanks for taking the time to read these words. Without a place to write this, these words are just flighty thoughts bombarding my head. It really helps to get them out and know that someone will hear me. I emailed a friend I did have, but who moved across the country last year. I told her how afraid I was and that I was glad that I could reach out to her as my friend. She responded that she was so sorry, but that she was on the way to work and would reach out to me later that day. That was yesterday and I still haven't heard from her. I know that she has her own life and people get busy, but it's just frustrating. I also talked with the neighbor across the street last night. I don't know her very well, but we talk on occasion. She was very compassionate and grabbed me for a big hug. It was nice.  ",

U/s did not show any sign of nodes being enlarged at all....very stressful not having surgery immediately, but picked neo adjuvant chemo so I would be at me strongest for it and not facing chemo after a stressful surgery. Dr. Hopes for complete pathological response from the tumor and that the chemo will take care of any spread that could have been in process. I have tremendous faith in the drs there based on my experiences. Can't wait for next 6 months to \"fly\" by and get my surgery done. First chemo was horrible. Got neulasta shot the next day to improve immunity and was in tremendous pain for 2-3 days on top of nausea. Then dealt with more tummy issues and am now suffering through a migraine. I learned a lot this time that will hopefully lead me to a more comfortable recovery next time.   ",

I want to say that it is important to remember that everyone handles surgery and recovery differently. I was initially so freaked out about diep because I had read some many stories about a painful, lengthy recovery. I had already been through 8 rounds of chemo over 5 months and just wanted to be done with cancer. I really almost just went with a bilateral mx and no reconstruction because of my fears of the process and how difficult it could be. Boy oh boy am I glad I pushed myself and had diep despite my fears. For me, it was no where near as bad as I had read and anything I experienced was 100% worth it. Doctors/Needles: TRUST. You have to be able to trust your doctors. If it feels at all like you can't communicate your fears to your team, get another team. If you can trust your team, everything is so much easier. A good team wants you to be comfortable and will do whatever they need to do to reach that goal. I travelled from AZ to Illinois for treatment and surgery because I found a team I had faith and 100% trust in. They made my experience so much easier because they knew me as a patient and what I needed. About the needles...I am okay with needles myself as I have one really easy to find vein and they hit it right everytime. If I was more anxious about veins, I would definitely tell everyone taking my blood first. If they are callous about it, ask for someone else. They only take blood once pre-op and a few times post-op. Post-op, you should be on so many pain meds you won't care. If you are having a sentinel node biopsy during surgery, there is an injection before surgery that can be an little painful...but you should get lidocaine and ice instructions to follow. Pain: I was definitely in answering lot of pain. I can't sugar coat it for you. Sorry. However, I was given access to whatever super duper heavy pain medications I needed and given a continuous pain pump. With all this, it was totally manageable. The first day after, I tried to go with less drugs and ended up asking for the heavier drug afterall. Don't be afraid to take the drugs those first few days in the hospital. They make it more comfortable for you to get up to walk and walking makes you heal faster. They removed my catheter the day after surgery and I called them when I needed to get up for the bathroom. Getting up was challenging because of all the tubes, drains, wires....don't wait until it's an emergency is all I am saying. Once they hung all my 'stuff' on the IV pole, they helped me up onto the edge of the bed and helped me 'stand'. You will be hunched for a couple weeks, but it gets better everyday. Once they helped me to the bathroom, I was able to manage by myself. Thankfully! I had surgery on Monday and left the hospital on Friday. I could have left Thursday, but I was given the choice and decided to stay one more night. Don't let them rush you out of the hospital. You should know when you are ready. I went to a hotel after I left the hospital. The next day, my husband and son went to a local mall for a little exercise and entertainment. So, I was at the hotel most of the day by myself and I was just fine. I began my arm range of motion exercises right away and I had no trouble doing most things on my own. If you have a stock of supplies low enough to reach for fora could of weeks you will be okay. Showering was as little annoying with the drains. Wound care was absolutely tedious. I would say that the whole wound care/drain management is the most annoying part of the whole deal. However, it all gets a little better each day. At night, I would tell myself...thank God that day is done and I don't have to live that one again. It honestly gets better every single day. 3 days after I left the hospital, I walked on the hotel treadmill at 1.0 miles per hour for 20 minutes. The next day, I went and gift little faster. The next day, I was at 3 mph and hardly hunched over at all. 1 week after I left the hospital, we took my son to an indoor waterpark hotel. The boys had a great time and I relaxed on a lounge chair with a good book. By then, all my drains we're out, I was walking without much of a hunch, I was off all my pain medications, and I was thinking God that I hadn't let my fear stop me from the surgery. I hope I answered your questions. I know how scary it is going into this surgery with so many doubts and fears. I know you feel like your support system is small, but there are so many of us here who have gone through this and odds are that anything you experience will be something we can help you through. You can do this. You are strong enough. You will be okay. You just have to keep telling yourself these things. It sucks!!! It really really sucks to be in this position at all, but you will be on the other side of it in no time at all and then you will be a resource to help someone else. P.S. The 9 hour surgery was the best sleep I had had in over 6 months. So, there is one side benefit.",

I am so sorry to hear that your consultations were so scary. Are you going to these appointments alone? Having someone with you is important. It's hard to hear everything the doctors say when our brains are overwhelmed. I know that you are in Maricopa. Are you coming up to the Valley for treatment? I don't know what your insurance situation is, but you should have some options. Being honest with you and scaring the crap out of you are 2 different things. It sounds like your doctor isn't confident that his team can keep you comfortable. As far as the pain is concerned, I'll say this...It's temporary. The other side of this surgery is soooo of worth the pain. It kiterally gets less painful every 5 minutes. If you can tell yourself that you can get through this 5 minutes at a time, you can get through the whole ordeal. And by the way, the pain medicines they can give you in the hospital these days are way better. I had something called an ON-Q pump. It was inserted into the lower abdominal area during surgery. I'd bet anything you didn't have something like that during your prior surgery. I would hate for you to miss out on a something that would make you so happy because of you fear of the complications and pain. It really is like a trust exercise. You are on the edge of a cliff and are asking the surgical team to catch you as you fall forward. There are teams out there who can do this effortlessly. If this surgery is something that you really want, find a team that can help you through it. My intention isn't to talk you into the surgery, but to encourage you to do what you really want. I agree with the genetic testing. Definitely something to know. When it comes back clean, it sets your mind at ease. If it comes back with a variant, it can make screening easier to target potential problems based on the gene involved. Remember that you are the one in charge. Tell your team what you want, what your reconstruction goals are, what you need to get through this emotionally. This whole ordeal is taxing. It's truly a marathon of obstacles that have to be overcome. You can overcome these obstacles if you have a good team. My team was amazing and it made all the difference.   ",
