I guess I am not as strong as I thought I was. I feel like a baby. I have so many questions and doubts. Tomorrow can't get here soon enough but then again I don't want it to get here. I am a mess. A bundle of nerves and worries. I have to say this again....The only change in a week with my breast is that it feels like the lump is smaller and the redness went away but now I have a little bit of pink over the lump. It does not itch. I have nothing going on with the nipple. I pray for everyone on this board and everyone who has ever experienced wait and fear. I just know that surgeon is going to come in that room tomorrow afternoon and tell me that I have the worst kind of BC ever and I am going to die in a couple of months. Crazy, huh?",

I have noticed many changes over the past few days. I am just going to throw them out there to .see if anyone can identify or have some advice for me. The first thing is the redness is gone...completely gone. It was bright red almost like how a bee sting looks right after it happens. That is how it looked when I saw my PCP. The redness started going away that night (Wednesday) and by Sunday it was completely gone. My breast is not warm. I have nothing going on with my nipple. There isn't any discharge or crustiness. I have no itching. I could kind of see the lump sticking up. Today I cannot. I swear it almost seems like it is a little smaller or even like the 1 lump is not kind of soft in the middle...or maybe it is now 2 lumps. I am not sure. I sure do wish Friday would get here so I can get some answers. Any advice is greatly welcomed. Thanks to everyone for taking time to read and answer my questions. I feel better when I read on this forum.",
