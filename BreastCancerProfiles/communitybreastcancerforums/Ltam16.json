I now believe I had mild lymphedema after radiation but when I had the mammogram in February it really exacerbated it. I was in tears due to discomfort and pain when I finally went to RO and surgeon.My breast was hard, heavy, hot to touch, and so swollen. The massage helped tremendously. Also my insurance covered 85% cost of the compression garments. And I didn't know but my insurance also covers 4 bras a year with a prescription. Being fit at a place that specialized in cancer patients made a huge difference. I was able to find better selection of wire free supportive bras. i only wish i knew before surgery and radiation",
