All they knew is that I had swollen lymph nodes under my arm and a breast cancer that didn't show up on mammos or US. My CT and bone scan came back negative for cancer elsewhere in my body. The MRI only looked at my breasts and barely registered the cancer in my right one. So I had a few months believing it was only in my right breast and 2 lymph nodes near it. It wasn't until I had the PET that they saw cancer all over the place, including my bones. So I was living with a false sense of security due to these worthless tests (worthless in my case at least). I am sitting here, stage 4, devastated, wondering why all this cancer didn't show up in the earlier tests.I thought the bone scan was supposed to see those mets! I don't think I could ever trust any other test but PET from now on.",
