Special K, I am still hoping this still ends up being just something odd, it would kinda fit with the way this all went. I'll be sure and post the outcome. Lisa",

I went in yesterday for my follow up visit with the surgeon, and he said that the pathologist at the hospital where I had the surgery was \"unable to identify it\"' and sent the results out to mayo clinic. I got the impression that my surgeon did have some opinion as to what it might be but he wasn't wlling to share at this point (at least not with me). He did throw out that it could possibly be atypical hyperplasia, (I believe that was what he said, I hadn't heard that term before yesterday) but surely the pathologist would be able to identify this without a send out to Mayo?? He also said that \"it wasn't cancer\"' but I question how you can know that for sure if you don't know what \"it\" is. I guess my assumption that he did have an idea of what we were dealing with came from the possible treatment options he threw out (tamoxifen or watching it very closely). I am a nurse working in a doctor's office, generally you don't have treatment plans for unknown diseases...... I will have to wait until my next visit, in a week, to find out what's really going on, at least I hope that is the end result. I had to laugh, when I told the doctor I work for what the surgeon said about the biopsy results, his reply was \"and what the hell does that mean??\"....... I laughed and said that was exactly what I said...... He did say possibly (only a big maybe) that it could be DCIS, he said it's not real common, and maybe our local hospital just wasn't sure enough to say without having it sent out. Wrong or right I appreciated his willingness to at least be honest about his thoughts........ I just needed to share with folks that would understand the difficulty of the waiting game that is played so frequently in healthcare. Not really freaking out or anything just a little frustrated with my surgeon at the moment........ I have been surfing this forum for the past few weeks and appreciate a place to vent those worries and such that go with these situations.

My doctors comment was quoted somewhat out of context of the conversation, but it was more along the line of how many patients in his practice that actually had this diagnosis. In many years of practice he has only seen a few. I think he was as puzzled as I was about my conversation with the surgeon. And yes I am frustrated with my surgeon, I felt like I was being \"handled\", softening the blow for bad news, but he kept telling me it wasn't serious. I'm really more of a shoot from the hip kinda person, I just wish he would have spit it out. I've read a few path reports and I find it hard to believe that the pathologist actually said \"I don't know what it is\", but who knows? maybe he did. When I get the copies of the path reports I guess I'll know. Whatever my diagnosis turns out to be, I will count myself lucky, a couple of years on tamoxifen or keeping a close eye on things is still a very minor inconvenience compared with what many women face with BC every day. I find some of this situation a little strange, I wasn't an alarmist, I have lumpy breasts, and have had another B9 lump removed years ago. The radiologist that read the mammo/ultrasound, said it doesn't look like anything but since its grown, it should be biopsied. The surgeon said, it doesn't seem to be anything, but we should just remove it. Now it isn't cancer, and it's probably nothing, but we sent it to Mayo Clinic. Kinda shaking my head at the trend here. Thank you for listening, and this is truly an informative site, with a lot of warm, caring people. Lisa",

Treatment plan at present is close f/u, repeat mammo in 6 months and referral to oncology to see if they have any additional treatment recs. I am relieved but aware that this could develop into something worse down the road. Thanks to all for the emotional support. Lisa",
