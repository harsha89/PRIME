At this point when my onc talks about balancing quality of life with treatment of disease,  I am clear that I am willing put up with the drug se's I've had so far to stay alive.  And I have been for over 5 years with mets.  Not always easy ones, as you all know, but for now my life is still worth living. Ah, a peaceful, comfortable, dignified death.  I believe it's possible, especially if I make it clear what I want and don't want (are docs ordering more drugs and tests to avoid malpractice suits?).  I continue to work with my mind so I won't spend my last days or months struggling, confused or in a panic.  A mind of equanimity, a room with a view, as little pain as possible, and supported by those I love.  Am I aiming too high?  ;-) For now, I am on a mission to help my family in advance by cleaning out closets and getting rid of accumulated stuff we don't use. ",

And no pain! The saddest part of it all is leaving behind people who will feel the loss. In the meantime, I aim to live a good life as Soleil505 said.

I agree that calling breast cancer that has spread either bone cancer, liver cancer, lung or brain cancer is a bit annoying.  But I have to admit that before I started traveling the cancer road, I knew very little. I don't talk much about this with people not dealing with cancer.  People, in general, want to feel like things are ok and many shy away from harsh realities. Thank you all for your support and understanding, though I wish none of us have to be going through this. I am also baffled why anyone with any critical illness wouldn't want to know something about their situation.  My onc engages me in the decisions about my treatments either based upon managing side effects, or what treatment should come next.  He will give me options and reasons why one or another would make sense. I would find it very difficult to be in the dark about what is happening, what choices I have, what to expect, etc.",

And I wasn't nearly as active as your mom seems to have been. That change alone would be enough to cause distress.  Also, I have had bone and joint pain from both anti-hormonal drugs and bone strengtheners.  Usually ibuprofen or Tylenol helps with that. I was \"cured\", I thought, until mets showed up 12 years after my first diagnosis.  The good news is that I am still doing well after 5.5 years, with mets in my bones and lungs.  Sometimes I have trouble sleeping either because I have muscle aches or feel unsettled.  At those times I take a sleeping pill to help me get to sleep and stay asleep.  I do find that if I am well rested, I feel better in general - mind and body. I think it's a great idea for you to accompany your mom on one of her visits with her doctor.  I never go alone because I can't always take it all in or remember what I wanted to ask.  I have a notebook that my husband has nearly filled up with his notes from these visits.",

I agree with texasrose - while you may be uncomfortable with having everyone know, it would, perhaps, be good for your son to know he can share with his closest friends and get the support he needs. And at the same time respect your wish for privacy. If I am doing ok, then he can say I'm doing ok. I have no idea whether my sons have shared my situation with anyone, but I leave it up to them.",

One of my most painful memories is how isolated and lonely I now realize my mother was when she was dying of stomach cancer.  It just wasn't something to talk openly about, maybe to keep giving the person hope (false as it was) and I'm sure she was trying to protect us from her suffering.  It still brings tears to me eyes to think about the fear and loneliness she never talked about.

Nothing is censored here and for that I am grateful.  Thank you all for your honesty and for sharing your vulnerable hearts.",

Might have prevented things from getting worse, however. I had deep grooves on the back my heels that sometimes split. Soaking my feet in a basin of cool water with epsom salts gave me relief when things were really painful. Occasionally I took a break from the drug for a cycle or two, usually if I was going on a trip or having out of town visitors. That helped a lot. The good news for me was that for 3 years Xeloda kept me stable, so I learned to put up with the discomfort. I was on a 14/7 cycle. Some people are on a 7/7. Talk to your onc about what is recommended for you and whether the 7/7 might be as effective and easier on your hands/feet. I hope you find a good balance to keep the hands and feet from feeling too bad and that the drug keeps you stable for a long time.",

Ebru has offered wise words - take care of yourself, cherish every moment, get a lot of sleep (with help, if necessary), breath and celebrate that you still can, shed the tears you need to shed with gentleness towards yourself, but don't get stuck there.  And as Caryn said - this is not your fault!

Wishing you many good years.  So much is possible in spite of those cold-hearted words. I am 4.5 years at Stage IV and still doing well. Caryn, How generous of you to respond to such arrogance and stupidity directly and without anger. Good bye and good riddance!  I agree that a healthy diet and one that includes what these days are called super foods while not a cure can strenghten the immune system to do what it naturally does to keep us healthy. Maybe for those of us with a knife to our throats, it is one thing we do have some control over. ",

I don't know which is harder - being diagnosed Stage IV from the start or soon after initial tx.  In my case I was clear for 12 years and was feeling safe and then the other shoe dropped.  HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN!  Well it did and it does. Welcome to this board where you will feel the understanding, love and support from these wondeful women. I have been stage IV for 4.5 year with mets to bones and lung.  I'm still doing well and have hopes about being around for quite a bit longer.

When I think about the past there are many choices I made that could have been different ones.  Who knows how life would have unfolded if I had taken other paths, for better or worse.  The person I am is the result of where I've been, what I've done, what I've learned (or not learned). I don't spend a lot of time regretting paths not taken, these are merely thoughts now.  I try to stay in the present and do the best I can - appreciate the inexpressible beauty in this world, my family, the few really good friends I have had for a long time, the spiritual teachings I have received from precious teachers.  In any moment, I aim to be fully present with an open heart. Brendatrue - I have also thought a lot about the difference between guilt and regret.  Guilt seems to be a sticky burden of harsh judgement towards oneself, a trap that is really hard to free oneself from.  There are actions I regret having taken, but rather than beat myself up, I, like you, try to use the awareness to make wiser choices in the present. I doubt that when the time comes for the lights to go out for me, I will be consumed with regrets about not having chosen a career over staying home with my children, or the mistake that was my first marriage, or the house we didn't buy.  Well, maybe I will have a small moment for the gorgeous shoes I could have worn if my feet weren't hurting so much on Xeloda.",

They started the IV after a couple of failures, finally got good blood return, but the veins halfway up my arm turned red and itchy. They stopped the push.  Onc ordered benadryl and zantac to stop the itch and quickly clear up the reaction.  Tried my other arm, which is on the side of my 1996 surgery.  Even though the veins were good, not having been used in 18 years, and the C flowed in well, they couldn't see any blood return. Decided to withhold  the A because of the potential tissue damage if it leaked out of the vein. The hospital nurse educator and the rest of the chemo nurses gathered around me to look at the spider web of red veins traveling up my arm and asked permission to take a picture for the nurses. So, in the end I got one of the two drugs and will finally get a port. My veins are not happy with all the poking they've had in the past 6 years.  After 5 tries and 5 hours yesterday, I'm ready.  It wasn't a terrible time - wonderful nurses, lots of warm blankets, my kindle.  Disappointing that I couldn't start the whole treatment, but at least I got something. love to all and many thanks for your support.  Jill",
