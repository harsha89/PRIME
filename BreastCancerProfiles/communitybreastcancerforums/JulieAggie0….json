I took a break for boards for the holidays and have been swamped this week getting everything tied up at work before my surgery next week. I feel like I should be doing more to prepare but don't know what I need to do. Getting nervous now! Also, I have been talking with my 4yo son about surgery and that mommy will need his help. I told him the doctors were cut out the bad stuff so that mommy gets all better, he seemed to understand that. It's amazing how kids process things sometimes, I am really going miss not being able to hold him for a while. Had my pre-op with my BS on Monday. They gave me a basic rundown of what to expect and told me I was having the injection for the SNB the day before my surgery, so not looking forward to that! Got a scrip for emla cream to use before SNB injection and valium and emend to take the morning of my surgery. What I thought was strange was that my BS made my post op appointment for the February 1st, seems like a long time to me? Don't most of you have followups like 7 to 10 days after surgery? My PS said the wouldn't see me until my drain output was down to less than 25cc 2 days in a row.",

I am doing well just had my second fill on my TEs today. A little sore but not bad. I had an appointment with an the RO my MO referred me to and I do not need radiation! My MO thought for sure I would regardless of my PCR because of my age and brca1 status but the RO assured me that those things would not change with radiation and I do not fall into the NCCN guidelines for radiation. Now I can move to reconstruction and I am torn between choosing the flap or easier but not permanent implants!?!? My PS said I am a great candidate for the flap (read I'm a little thick in middle, lol). I just don't know if I want to take the easy way and have implants and be done for now or the longer recovery but not have to do this again in 5 to 10 years...plus when else would I get a tummy tuck paid for?p by insurance?? So much to consider... Hope everyone is well, sorry for being MIA.",

When I went for my pre-op with the BS last week they told me to shower with the betadine scrub and make sure to wash my chest to armpit area thoroughly with it. I asked the PS and his nurse today about the scrub and if it will take off the marker and they said yes so don't use the scrub very much on my upper torso just the rest of my body...and they told me to use the emla sparingly today before my SNB RI injection today to keep the markings in place also contrasting what my BS said...I love specialists who can't get their pre-op instructions together?!?",

My post op instructions were very short and I had to go off what the BS told me when she changed my dressing the first morning in the the hospital, she said keep a thin layer of nesporin and clean gauze over the incisions and not to remove my surgical bra until further notice. I did not have dermabond or steristrips. Over my drain sights I have tegraderm and they said to leave that alone unless it gets funky looking underneath then I could change it as they sent me home with some. When I called in my drain totals today she said we'll most likely be able to pull them tomorrow if both sides are under 25, I was 22.5 and 25 for yesterday. Also strange I don't follow up with my BS or PS until the first week of February. I'm sure the PA will look at everything when I get the drains removed but still hope I can tell if I'm healing ok!  @Balthus- that nurse does sound a little mean or cold at least.

Funny you mention neosporin....My PS and BS did say to use it on the incisions and change gauze daily, however after a week the skin surrounding the incisions is flaming red and irritated, the incisions alone are fine and I have no signs of infection but skin around is bad. Sent pic to my PS nurse and she said since incisions are good, nofever, nothing warm to touch, or oozy it's a reaction to the nesporin and to just keep everything covered with dry gauze to see if it gets better. ðŸ™„ The scrub I used in the shower on the morning of surgery wasn't betadine it was the 2% chlorhexadine gluconate something or other in a sponge form...and yes my skin is still itchy from it I swear! On stripping the drains-my care sheet just had instructionsto do it but no frequency, the surgical onc nurses told me at discharge not to bother doing it unless I thought there was a blockage as evidenced by leaking/irritation around where the hose exits the skin or sudden drainage drop. I have done it about every other day just to be safe.",

Now if could just hold one, maybe it newborn baby therapy! I've been up to walk once and sat in the chair in my room. I'm really sore but the pain isn't bad.BS said I could go home today if pain isn't too bad off morphine pump and only taking Norco now.
