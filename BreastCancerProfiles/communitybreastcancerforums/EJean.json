I was in a bit of a daze and asked the nurse if we were going to start the procedure soon but at that point she told me we were already finished! It does make it feel a little more real, but I'm glad to have another step crossed off the list as I make my way to beating this thing. If you are still waiting to get yours in, don't spend too much time worrying like I did. I've felt a little better after each step and hope it will be the same for the chemo - that once I understand exactly what I'm in for the rest will be a little easier to handle by being known. The change in treatment options would make my head spin too, there is already so much to come to terms with. If you are looking for more support, Gilda's Club has a lot of resources. They are on Wells at Grand and have a number of activities and support groups. I haven't had a moment to go to the meetings yet but hope to go to their new members breakfast soon. EJean ",

I was scheduled for round 2 tomorrow but we have to delay it a week because my wbc count has not rebounded enough. The docs were a little surprised as we've only just started and I would've been at my strongest this round and she wouldn't expect this issue so soon. She said there's not much to do but wait. I had the neulasta shot and it seemed to function properly. It's possible that whatever was going on with me last week was an infection and messed with my immune system. I'm scared this will happen every time and that I won't be strong enough to endure the chemo or too many delays will make it less effective I saw the recommendation for bone broth which i\u2019ll give a try. I\u2019m wondering if maybe some excercise would stimulate some new cell production too? ",

My doctor scheduled me the day before planned infusion. I see some day of and some a week before? Is it more advantageous to check at any particular point? I'm wondering if I should ask to have it checked earlier and maybe will need more Neulasta or a different kind of bone stimulant, assuming there are others? I dread shots, I really hope I don't have to do self injections like you mentioned. I did fertility preservation and it was a week and 1/2, 2-3 shots a night with blood draws every few days. I was worn out from that before I even got to the chemo. ",

I\u2019m glad to hear you are all staying strong - either feeling well or determined to weather the side effects. I\u2019m currently at the hospital for my second infusion. 1 week did the trick and all my blood counts are back up. I plan on eating more iron rich foods and bone broth this next go around. Daniz, are the iron infusions making you feel better at least? Dives, glad you are feeling good. I\u2019ve read the gym is a great way to fight fatigue and hope to get there myself. Though every cold snowy day has said otherwise. I\u2019m finally going to clipper my hair tonight. I got away with it up until maybe Wednesday last week using a thick headband and some creatively placed extensions. Almost over night it thinned out to such extent there was no fixing it. Haven\u2019t gotten my wig yet though, had to have the fitting rescheduled at the boutique manager had the flu but next week I\u2019ll be all set and hopefully be able to look normal and avoid uncomfortable questions/comments. All the great photos I\u2019ve seen have given me hope. Hariry, you are looking awesome! Wishing you all strength to endure ",

The oncologist feels I have the time to do so if I wish to take it though it feels like flirting with disaster.

My husband and I still hope to have a family. I\u2019m trying to weigh all the risks - I want to do what\u2019s best for my health but I also hope I can still have the life we dreamed of.

Third round has been delayed BC my blood counts are too low (.9) when they should be 1.5. I\u2019ll give it another try next week. They plan to lower the dose of the Carboplatin which is likely the culprit for the low counts. I\u2019m on a high dose to begin with since I\u2019m relatively healthy (she said it was a 6 units when Standard is 4) I saw some others struggling with this. It\u2019s frustrating to be delayed but my oncologist assured me it will make treatment no less effective. Rest up and be resilient! I\u2019d like to ask what kind of changes everyone has made to their lifestyle. Aside from cutting down on alcohol (from A few glasses of wine on the weekend to 0-1 per week) I\u2019m working on switching out products with parabens/pthalates as they are hormone disrupters. Very hard to figure out which products have what though. I found the blog gimmethegoodstuff which posts great reviews of all sorts of products - geared towards moms, there\u2019s lots of baby products reviewed. The guides are very useful though and I ordered some lavanila deodorant that was recommended. There\u2019s so much bad stuff out there it\u2019s tough to avoid. Any favorite brands or resources or organic/all natural products?",

I'll start on the 18th for 6 rounds and then it's on onto herceptin for a very long time. Wishing you all strength and good luck.",

We\u2019ll see what tomorrow brings but I\u2019ve got high hopes. I\u2019m on a slightly different regimen as I\u2019m Triple positive. They\u2019ve got me on TCHP for 6 cycles and then continuing on herceptin every 3 weeks for a year. I think the surgery will happen between those two steps. It\u2019s a lengthy treatment but I should get the hang of it by then. I see you\u2019re starting in a few days- strength and good luck to you. They really have got it down to the science and should be able to help ease any side effects. Don\u2019t hesitate to express any discomfort you\u2019re feeling. Rest and drink lots of water. I think it may be like bracing for a terrible hangover and I\u2019ve survived those before plenty. I bought some scarves from head coverings.com and recommend their site. They have some really nice options and I am happy with the ones I chose. I also heard shaving can cause in growns so I\u2019m going to cut it short to let it fall out on its own in a less traumatic way. I\u2019ve heard many say it was in the first 2-4 weeks so with my birthday approaching I think I\u2019ll ask my husband to trim it as a gift to me. Or maybe if I think I can get a couple more weeks out of it, a professional so my hair won\u2019t end up quite so silly looking. I agree that just leaving it to ruin on it\u2019s own is no good. I like finding the moments where at least how I experience this is on my terms, with grace and endurance. ",

Drinking lots and lots of fluids has helped so consider this your friendly reminder to drink extra water today. The nurse told me to divide weight in half and aim to drink that many ounces in a day. I heard blood in the nose is normal - especially if you\u2019re in cold and dry temperatures. Running a humidifier at night has helped me immensely. I wish this winter would ease up a bit, we\u2019ve already had our pipes freeze up and had no water for 24hrs before we could get it fixed. I don\u2019t want that to happen again!",
