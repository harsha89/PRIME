ChocLover, my cat is similar to yours, but doesn't have as much orangey-red.  She's a mama's baby.  Barbe, no, she's not buying the house for the both of them to live in.  She's moving out of his house and will tell him when she has a binding contract which should be soon.  I believe they've just about negotiated all they're going to.  She got them down $20,000 from their asking price WHICH they had just reduced by $10,000 before she started the negotiations!  I think that's pretty good.  Plus, she wants them to pay $1000 toward her closing (she asked for $2000).  They said $1000 but the washer and dryer would not stay.  She said she may take the $1000, but wants the washer and dryer.  I told her it seemed they were splitting everything in half and will probaby tell her she can keep the washer but not the dryer...LOL  There's just too many differences between she and her bf.  However, she's not out to hurt him.  But, she thinks he knows something's up.  If you knew some of the stuff he wanted her to go in with (like pay his half of the mortgage for his condo at the beach and if they got engaged, pay 1/2 of the ring cuz he's been burned twice by those marriages) you'd flip.  He gave that up, but there's other problems and most of it is money.  They have different values.  Better to know before getting married.  Okay, enough about my dd.",

Everytime I eat a salad I wonder what pesticide I'm eating.  Sure would have liked some of your dad's milk.  I remember when they delivered it (when I was young) to our door.  There was cream on top.  And it was WHOLE milk...LOL This is so easy to make.  I know it's bad for you...but having it once in a while is fine (I think).  You could make this for Dr. McDreamy.  Nah, it would melt because the heat in the examing room would be accelerated by your heavy breathing.  Oh, and there's a video on there to show ya how to make it.  I didn't use the foil.  I used my tupperware cake keeper. http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/oreo-fudge-ice-cream-106562.aspx OREO & Fudge Ice Cream Cake       What You Need! 1/2 cup hot fudge ice cream topping, warmed 1 tub  (8 oz.)

Kraft Kitchens Tips Note The consistency of fudge topping can vary depending on what brand you purchase. If the fudge topping mixture is too thick to spread easily, stir in 1/4 cup milk.

I'm assuming that you are postmenopausal since you're taking Femara.  Hopefully that will kick in and help control the mets.  When I was recently diagnosed with mets to a vertabra, my oncologist switched me to Aromasin which seems to be working.  I have not started Zometa yet. I can truly understand how you feel...being scared and feeling all alone.  Please do take the advice of the ladies here and ask your oncologist for a prescription for an anti-anxiety drug.  Also, an antidepressant may be something else you need. I've been going to Duke for years to see a gyno.  And a few other doctors.  I always had my mammos there.  I had one in March of '04, and found my lump that same year in December.  Perhaps if I had been vigilant and had done SBEs I would have found it sooner...but that's in the past.  The little over two hour drive is worth it.  I did my chemo there, but did my rads here because it was not financially feasible to stay in Durham a week at a time, plus I had a cat and a dog.  And, my dog was not well.  My husband does go with me each time.  That is one busy place.  They are building a new cancer center.  I did not go on the computer researching because I was petrified.  I let anyone else who wanted to do that for me.  My daughter would give me the good news ONLY...LOL  This is not easy, and I can only imagine that you would like to crawl in bed and sleep to the awakening of a bad dream (nightmare).  My advice for you is not to read any statistics....you ARE NOT a statistic.  Do get a second opinion if you do not feel comfortable with your team.  No one should have used the word \"palliative.\"  That word has a negative connotation for those of us who do not understand this disease and how many treatments there are that can help stabilize it or put it in remission.  However, I believe the gals here explained all of that to you very well. Keep coming back here for support.  Never feel badly about posting anything.  Rant, stomp your feet...just get things off your chest.  Hopefully that will receive some of your stress. Take care and let us hear from you. Shirley",

Dreamwriter...breast cancer.  Oh how awful. We don't think of animals getting bc.  My Tasha (dog) gave us a scare when she was around 4 years old.  I didn't have her spayed.  She developed lumps in her breast.  The doc thought it could be breast cancer.  The surgery proved otherwise, thank God.  She was immediately spayed while in surgery.  In case anyone doesn't know, when you have a female animal they need to be spayed in order to prevent bc.  That is if you are not going to breed them.  I suppose they can also get bc even if they are spayed. Dreamwriter, I'm sorry for your loss too.  I have cried more than once right here on this board (not literally..lol) when people have announced the loss of one of their precious pets.  I am so happy there are so many animal lovers.  Elizabeth, what a good Mommy you are.  Do you know that many people would put down their cat if it had the same problems as yours?  Gizmo was a diabetic cat.  I had to give him insulin shots.  One person from my primary's office thought it was great that I didn't put him down, but instead gave him his insulin shots.  I thought to myself...what?  But it's true that some people would not want to be bothered.  And I love the idea that your cat is a very SENIOR cat and you still are giving her LOVE and treatments to keep her alive.

Take care of your sweet wife.  You are a treasure. Shirley",

When I was dxd with mets it was by accident...no pain.  She decided to do a CT and bone scan after I complained about my LE arm..armpit feeling swollen.  Since I had positive nodes she wanted to check it out to be sure...then she decided to do bone scan as well.  Perhaps it was because my calcium  was a bit elevated....she also did blood work for parathyroid.  Anway, to our surprise the CT and bone scan picked up one lesion on my L1.  I wanted a biopsy so we could be positive and also to know the pathology of the lesion. Sometimes she does CT and bone scans.  This time (after six months) she's only doing a CT scan.  I asked why not the bone scan also.  It seems the bone scan picks up new lesions that the CT does not.  But these scans are tricky.  She says sometimes it could be a lesion that is healing.  I do know if the CT picks up something new it will suggest a bone scan.  These tests confuse me.  She tires to explain it to me and I get more confused.  Last time my bone scan said \"stable\".  The CT said something different...could have been a lesion healing..I think it said sclerotic something or another.  I don't have my report in front of me. There's not one set standard.  It's all scary.  If I had to go by my pain level I would say I still wouldn't know and I found out about my single bone met Sept. 2009 (I think).  Of course we all know that the CT can pick up lesions in the soft tissue.  My sciatica bothers me from time to time, but I had that before I knew I had mets.  Or, something else may hurt just a little and I get all stressed.  Then it goes away.  So, I don't know what to think.  Sorry, I'm of no help.  Just as confused as ever!   ",

LOL \"A compound or food ingredient can be estrogenic, and bind to an estrogen receptor, but you don't know if it's an antagonist or agonist unless you do a functional study.  A lot of the \"phytoestrogenic\" foods listed may actually be protective by binding to the receptors and blocking activity.  That's what makes it all so complex.  So some phytoestrogens may be a good thing!\"  I'm still going to take my tumeric.  I don't take as much as Constantine advised.  I take my one little capsule of green tea instead of being a good girl and drinking it.  Before this bc journey is over we'll all be doctors, researchers or nutritionists.  Shirley",

I believe most of us grieved for Patrick Swayze with his Pancreatic Cancer (another horrible one...and ovarian cancer).  We saw a virile man go down to nothing while fighting with all of his might.  He was doing his show with no pain meds.  What a strong example.  I hate cancer, period!",
