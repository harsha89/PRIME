My mother died from stage 4 metastatic breast cancer 8 years ago after a 6year battle. No previous symptoms in her whole body. She found hers the same way and in the same breast. She missed a mammgram or two though, I had my last one 10 mos ago and it was negative with no findings. My lump is jaw breaker size and showed up all of a sudden (2-3mos .. Im not great about breast self exams) it is painless but funny burning sensation ... sometimes in both breasts. I am scared to death like the rest of us in here. Imagining the worst, trying to imagine how to deal \"if\", surfing the internet too much! My US showed a mass (hate that word) with no vascular innervention, no suspicious lymph nodes, some cystlike qualities (layers of tissue and fluid and \"junk\") and some un cystlike qualities ( fact that it is not totally fluid and \"angry\" border) Radiologist recommended the biopsy but wanted to try needle first. She could not get any fluied but said it good not blood out of it either. She did 6 punch biopsies. I was completely numb, but still the most horrible experience ever. I was whole body shaking so hard the bed was shaking. At biopsy US radiologist stated still not sign of vascular innervention which I take as good news. When I asked what she thought, she said \"honestly there are a few benign things it could very well be, but are a couple of things youve never heard of but don't worry about that right now. \" The rad tech said when she left that it might very well be a fibroadenoma but they wont know without the biopsy. She said to hang in there, read, go for walks, etc. But how do you do this ? Really. I am so scared. I am one for preparing for the worst , and being ready of everything. I like plans of action and HOPE really. There is nothing for sure about this!! This site has really helped me. I have read so many women going through this same thing. The worst thing beyound the waiting is that I will find out likely while I am at work on Tues or Wed. I am a dental hygienist, so I will likley get the call while with a patient, have to get up, get the news, and go back to the patient. How do I do that if it's not benign? Also, what do they say to you? What do they do at that point, refer you to an oncologist? I know I am getting ahead of myself, but I just feel like I want to be ready, but how do you do that? It helps to read others stories; when they turn out benign and when they need treatment. Shows me it's not an instant death sentance , people get though this and do well. It doesnt take away that there are times I am completely terrified, especially at night. Any advice, insight, words of wisdom? I know this though, however this turns out, even if it is completely benign. This will change my life. Best wishes and prayers for everyone here.",
