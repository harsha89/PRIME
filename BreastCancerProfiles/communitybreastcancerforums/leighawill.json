This is definitely the hardest decision I have ever had to make.  My surgeon mentioned nipple sparing mastectomy?? I'm leaning towards mastectomy. Most of my family want me to get the mastectomy, but my boyfriend of 4 years is leaning toward radiation, but says he will support me with whatever I chose.  After a mastectomy how long is it before you can wear a padded bra??? Confused, Leigh Anne",
