It sounds like they must be concerned about something if you have birads 4. I have not had any large cysts - only a few small and one complex. Did they say anything about the apocrine metaplasia? From my research, it appears that they think it is pre-cancer but I'm not sure many docs are familiar. The pain is new for me and has only started since the multiple lumps so it seems that it would be related - obviously I'm hoping it's just fibrocystic but have to be careful because Mom had BC at a young age.  ",

I've decided to take a small \"vacation\" from worrying about my lumps etc until my next appointment with the BS in Sept. but was hoping someone could answer a question in the meantime. I have multiple lumps - some that can be felt and more that are seen on imagining (US and digital mammo) - MRI was clean. I noticed that some of the lumps - particularly an area that had become more dense on mammo that is a palpable lump - is more tender in the middle of my cycle. So is the lump on the same breast that already had a portion biopsied. Is this a good sign - does that make it more likely to be benign? They are saying that my left breast had some fibrocystic changes but the cysts are not where the lumps are. Does the fibrous tissue hurt? Or does BC sometimes react to the estrogen in the pill on a cyclical basis? They have some spots they wanted to \"watch\" including these areas. Birads 3. Thanks!

I'm tired of being worried and sometimes want to just ignore my symptoms even though I know it is potentially dangerous. I am very high risk due to family history (mom) and other factors. I keep getting lumps and biopsies. Mom was very supportive and came up for my last surgery which was a large lump open excision. However, once I got a benign (pre-cancerous) result, she seems to think that I should just ignore the two lumps in my other breast and the fact that the previous diagnosis (fibroadenoma) did not match the birads 4 US. These things concern me and concerned a path friend of mine as well. The surgeon was going to try to get out any additional tissue by the clip with the excision but was unsuccessful and only took a large portion of the other lump. Now I feel like it's my duty to myself and my children and husband to follow up with a second opinion on that first questionable lump and the other two. My Mom says if I keep shopping doctors that someone will tell me what I want to hear. This made me mad! I asked her what exactly she thought I wanted to hear because all I want to hear is that I'm fine. Now, given, I don't want to someone to just pat me on the head and tell me I'm fine - I would like evidence that I'm fine. I would love it if they do the US and say -oh, don't worry, it's just simple cysts. I really don't want more surgery. The main problem for me is that the tests aren't really helpful due to density and I would like some reassurance without surgery. I don't know if it's possible. Am I just being paranoid?

I've had a D&C and an excisional biopsy separately and neither one was a huge deal (I was awake for both) so I would think if you can knock them both out while you are asleep that would be good. Try to relax yourself so you don't think too much about it and it will all be done before you know it. Make sure you know exactly what they are going to do beforehand (location of incisions, amount of tissue etc) so you don't have any surprises and then bring something distracting to the hospital like a video game, book etc so you don't get too worried and things will go smoother.

You stay in the machine the whole time but they didn't compress as much as usual and the window helps. Also, they gave me a chair to sit in so it really wasn't that uncomfortable at all. I was awake for my surgery - a fairly sizeable lump at least in relation to the rest of me ;). I really had no pain at all. Just a little stinging. They gave me a vicoden after but I only nibbled at it and hid the rest in case I needed it which I didn't. I used lots of ice to keep the swelling and pain down - peas actually. Have several bags on hand. I was a little surprised by the core biopsy I had before and I think it was mostly that I was unprepared and didn't know what was going to happen so I hope this helps ease your mind. I took my iPod and played games on it while I was waiting for the surgery so I wouldn't think too much and chatted with my \"neighbors\". I read somewhere a study in which they gave gameboys to kids before surgery and they had much less pain. I really believe this. Bring something to distract you if you are a worrier like me.",

I have so many other risk factors that a negative probably wouldn't make me worry less. Plus I am under close follow up because of suspect areas already. Is it worth it?

He recommended strongly that I have the entire biopsy material sent to another pathologist not associated with the company that did the first one and have a second opinion. I have yet to do this but I plan to. They did do a wire localization and excisional biopsy to try to get at this a second time but they missed so now I'm back to sending it out. From what I have read, there are three possibilities - one is that the path is right, two that they missed the spot, and three that there is malignancy but they sliced the wrong part. If they missed it, then you are back to square one - otherwise, getting a second opinion should tell the story as long as they are independent. I plan to try to get it sent without the report so I can get a clean opinion. Hope you get some answers that you can be confident in. ",

I noticed you said one of the docs told you that the patient hardly ever finds the cancer but I'm pretty sure that is the opposite of the truth. I tend to trust the doctors who know the latest research, and whose statements match things that I know to be true and who listen to my concerns. My brother was born with Atrial Septal Defect and was tested repeatedly throughout his younger years to determine if it had closed. Now as an adult a cardiologist has convinced him that he never had ASD.  Of course he did have it, he just doesn't remember it and his new doc doesn't have access to the old tests. This seems similar to the statement about radiation in your case.  If you are concerned about it, pursue it and figure out who you trust. Unfortunately doctors are somtimes wrong - if three doctors give three different opinions about something, two of them are wrong. Sometimes too many opinions just confuse the issue.

I figure it's kind of like the rain prediction in Florida - if they say 50% that means it will rain 50% of the time. Since it's an all or none - you either have BC or you don't, it makes sense to me that if they say 50% they mean 50% of people with those characteristics will have BC and the others won't and they don't know which ones out of the population it will be. How many are out there that have the same problem I do - my breasts are so dense that mammos are useless and US and MRIs aren't much better? They did all three and couldn't see the large palpable lump they just took out. Surveillance doesn't seem to be much use. RE mastectomy: Does the recovery time depend on what type? Also, does it depend on what type of cancer? In other words, if I did a prophy, could I keep my skin and nipple and do immediate recon vs waiting to see if BC develops and then lose skin and nipple and have to do expanders etc? Plus maybe radiation so no recon? I'm not very well informed on this stuff and am hoping to learn more. If I keep having to get these lumps out surgically, I may want to opt for this. I've already had the nipple scraped on one side plus enough tissue out that my right breast is about 1/3 gone and completely different than the other. The nipples are now not at the same height. Although maybe if I wait and the new lump on the other side grows under the nipple as well, they will match - they will both look like volcanos with the tops blown off! Good thing I'm not that vain!",

I think the difference between that and my thought process is that I'm not just worried about the next five years which looks like what they based the studies on. If you start from 1 out of 8 and then add family history, dense breasts, biopsies etc. you are likely to get higher than 50% for lifetime. I figure that if I'm going to get breast cancer at any time in my life, it may be better to have surgery done now to deal with it while my overall health is better than wait to deal with it under deteriorating health. I'm not there yet, but I'm guessing that's where I'm heading mentally. This stuff wears me out. Kim",

I am hoping someone will be able to tell me if this seems OK or not. I had an open excision for a lump on Feb 24th so about a month ago. This was actually more like a thickening growing fast - probably quadrupled in about 3 months - turned out to be benign /  pre-cancerous on path- adenosis, fibrosis, duct ectasi, apocrine metaplasia. The surgeon apparently thought it looked cancerous during surgery because he marked the margins of one part and sent it for a frozen section. He did not take all of it and he did not get a previous lump they tried to locate with a wire which was birads 4 on core biopsy which they said was fibroadenoma but did not look like it on US. The lump was quite large and had grown under the nipple so he scraped the nipple and got a section about 2x2x1cm - but not all of it. Now I have a large hardened area well beyond the biopsied area. He took about 1/4 to 1/3 of my breast - I'm small. I had some discharge before and during the mammo wire procedure a lot of fluid sprayed out. I also had a lot of bleeding during the wire and after the surgery bled so much he wanted to take me back in - I managed to get it to slow down with pressure. Now I have stinging similar to milk letdown during nursing and new pain. I'm having more pain rather than less now. Is it possible that this is just the healing process? I guess that I'm worried that since he only took out part and didn't get the old bit that maybe the lump is still growing and that something is still there. Not really sure what to do about it anyway since I think they would disregard anything on imaging as scar tissue now. Any ideas? I know there is quite a lot of knowledgeable people here so please help! I was hoping to have clear answers after surgery but only have more questions.  Thanks!

I'm just frustrated because I have very dense breasts and most of the tests don't work well. The digital mammo is supposed to be much better for dense breasts and in fact it did look much better to me. The old ones were a snowstorm and the new ones definitely show the internal parts. I really felt like if I had a closer look, I could tell something where the little bb's were put on showing the palpable lumps. I just think he either had no interest or wasn't trained. Either way, he didn't seem to want to help me determine what the lumps are. It would be great if they could definitely rule out cancer, which of course is practically impossible, but I at least expect them to try to tell me what the lumps are - cysts, solid lumps, what bi-rad level etc. I guess I will see after the ultrasound but the large thickened part they already looked at with everything and had no luck.  ",

I have now 6 lumps, one of which has been biopsied twice - it's a large thickened area actually. I have an ultrasound scheduled also so they just brushed me off after waiting all that time and didn't want to let me meet with the radiologist. When I finally did, he just said to wait for the ultrasound and that nothing was really jumping out at him. I have very dense breasts so I had really pinned my hopes on this. I tried to get him to give me some indication of what all these lumps are but he didn't tell me a thing. I tried looking online for a mammo that looked like mine but I don't see any that look similar. Mine are filled with lines that are interconnected with star shaped spots. Has anyone had a digital mammo that showed anything useful? I'm mad because he just said wait for the ultrasound then I could get an MRI or biopsy. Why doesn't this guy get the fact that I don't want to be chopped on in 6 places? The point of having these tests is to determine the likelihood that it's cancer to avoid having to biopsy every lump. I don't want to wait until it \"jumps out\" and I really don't like it when they just refer me to the next test. They take no responsibility for using the test they just did to make any kind of determination. In the past I have had no luck - they do the mammo, US and MRI and then still do the biopsy.

Also, my doctor is concerned about my ovaries due to enlargement, cysts etc. Any advice? Also, Vickie -  have you done these risk assessments? I was thinking about the same thing. I have had several biopsies, just finished a lumpectomy which is apparently not what they call it when it turns out benign but still has taken a big chunk out including under the nipple so I'm already what I jokingly call \"mangled\" (what can you do but joke??) and I have two more on the other side which are growing and haven't been evaluated. When do you stop chopping and just take the damn things away?

They did a core biopsy and said it was a fibroadenoma. This left a dent for a while. About 6 to 8 months ago, I felt a new lump (I couldn't feel the first one) in the same place which filled in the dent. I had US, MRI, Mammo - none could determine what it was apparently due to density in the area. They could not differentiate the lump from the very dense tissue there. I was referred to a surgeon who wanted to watch and wait for 3 months. I went back today - the lump is bigger and now has a finger like extension going under the nipple and it also feels like there is an additional lump on top. The surgeon now wants to do a needle localization in mammo to find the clip they put there before to remove anything left of the old lump and to take out the new lump in excision. He said that it \"doesn't feel like cancer\" to him but he said you can't be too careful especially with my Mom having double mastectomy at age 32. A pathologist friend told me previously that they should have another look at the lump if the diagnosis disagrees with the US and this was never done so this is part of what made me nervous when it grew back.  Has anyone had an experience like this? Particularly the finger like extension under the nipple? Anyone had a core biopsy and then regrowth?  Obviously I'm hoping it's just fibroadenoma but I don't know if they grow back or have extensions like this. I would rather be prepared for cancer if that's what it is. I do much better with preparing myself than surprises so if you have had a bad experience with something like this, don't mince words - just tell me flat out so I can start preparing.

First I had a \"thickening\" above my nipple which was mildly painful and that's the only reason I noticed it. They did mammo (useless due to density) and an ultrasound. Didn't see anything. Did an MRI - didn't see anything. Sent to surgeon - he said wait 3 months. It quadrupled in size in that time and he did an excisional biopsy which was benign. Duct ectasia I think was the main cause which is in fact a blocked duct essentially. I now have a similar thing happening on the lower side below the nipple on the same breast which they are checking into. If you find out before I do, let me know and I'll do the same. I think you must be like me and not knowing is the worst part. It could be something like mine or different. If it's the same, supposedly warm compresses help- you could try that- I doubt it would hurt. At least this is one possibility. I hope this helps and perhaps you will get other opinions. I would definitely go see the doctor and find out what is going on.  ",

      "Content": "floridian wrote: Hello all -  Hope you are doing well after all your surgeries. I was hoping to start a topic here similar to the \"What to Expect When You Are Expecting\" idea (except of course, not fun). I found this to be extremely helpful when I was pregnant and it seems that many people are wondering exactly how the whole thing will go from the patient perspective. For example, exactly what happens? General Anesthesia, Mastectomy, Expanders vs Implants, What Are the Drains like and what comes out, how much pain and bruising, recovery time and limitations, reconstruction procedures and timing etc. I think this would be very enlightening for those of us to may be facing either necessary or prophylactic surgery. If there's already a thread like this, please direct me. Thanks so much for sharing your stories.   (dense breasts, fibroadenomas, duct ectasia, apocrine metaplasia and undiagnosed lumps) Log in to post a reply",

Your friends and family seem so sweet.  Maeve - thanks for sharing also. I can see how losing a part of your body you've been used to your whole life can be very traumatic. I keep telling myself I'm finished with them but it's hard to picture not having them. I'm even missing the chunks that are gone already. But they are not behaving themselves so they may have to go! ",

I been round and round with lumps etc. and they have found nothing cancerous. I just keep telling myself that it's not cancer till it's cancer. You can make yourself crazy with worry so it's best to try to focus on other things until you find out for sure. My Mom had BC when she was 32 and she's still fine right now at 64.  Best wishes! ",
