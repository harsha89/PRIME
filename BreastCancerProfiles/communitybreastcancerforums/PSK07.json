If you are covered by an employer, and that employer is self-insured, it becomes more difficult, but not impossible to get things turned around. In Washington State we have a very consumer-oriented insurance commission. We have also pioneered requiring some medical treatments be provided by insurors offering group coverage in the state.  Things such as mental health parity, alternative/complementary medicine, etc. In many cases, if it looks like they company will continue to deny, deny, deny, one letter to the Ins Commissioner and cc'd to the insurance company (or vice versa) will do the trick.  My mother initially had her treatment for BC denied because the insurance co. decided it was a pre-existing condition (she changed companies about 3 months prior to her dx). It took her surgeon, PCP, and onc, along with a well-timed letter to the State to get the decision turned around. ",

From what women here have said, micromets with DCIS usually don't mean chemo.  The ER/PR - does mean that you can't use a hormonals like Tamoxifen, so making sure you get the right and best treatment is the most important thing. Odds are they will do a sentinal node biopsy along with your lumpectomy which will check for anything further.  With grade 3 DCIS, the rads are imperative, especially with ER-/PR- status. If you go down the page of topics a bit, there is a discussion on DCIS and one of the regular posters, Beesie, did have a micro invasion with her DCIS and has lots of info and research which might help resolve some of the confusion.

ALH is certainly in a gray area.  ALH is typically an incidental finding, that is it is diagnosed because they do a biopsy for something else.  So, in your case, they did the biopsy and whatever they were looking at was benign, but in the tissue they found the ALH. Since it doesn't present as a lump or lesion, it's just there in the lobules, they don't do other surgery.  ALH is defined as an overactive growth of cells in the milk glands. In the results of one study shown here at bc.org, looking at certain non-cancerous lumps they found the following: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/83/topic/724179 The researchers then looked for any relationships between the different breast cancer risk factors. They found that for women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, the age at diagnosis made a difference. When compared to the average woman in the SEER registry: Women younger than 45 with atypical hyperplasia were seven times more likely to develop breast cancer. Women between 45 and 55 with atypical hyperplasia were five times more likely to develop breast cancer. Women older than 55 with atypical hyperplasia were three times more likely to develop breast cancer. It's important to note that, for women with non-proliferative breast lumps who had a weak or no family history of breast cancer, there was NO increase in the risk of breast cancer. I read this a couple of weeks ago, right after I had surgery to remove some LCIS that was in a nodule - in the pathology for that nodule, they found ALH in a number of the tissue slices. Scary stuff.  But, the good news is not cancerous.  I'll have lots of monitoring until I go through menopause and my breasts aren't dense.  As my surgeon said, though, he cuts, oncologists treat. I met with an oncologist prior to surgery and am meeting with her again this week to go over the results and discuss risk & most likely get a prescription for Tamoxifen. The onc I was referred to treats only breast cancer & has a particular interest in risk factors and genetics. She seems a good fit. (One I saw last year after my DCIS dx wasn't.) After you see an oncologist you should have a better understanding of your risk factors and get some guidance on the treatment options and monitoring that are right for you. Good luck and take care. Oh - look at the LCIS discussion a bit down the board. WHile you don't have LCIS, there are a number of women who have both & will have some insight.  ",

Seeing an oncologist, even without having a cancer dx, is important because your risk of developing invasive BC is higher.  The onc will be able to talk to your risk factors, family history, current diagnosis, and recommend a treatment/preventative course of action.  S/he may end up sending you back to your PCP for prescriptions/mammo/MRI scheduling, but it is good to at least talk to an expert.

(No PETA girl here) They gave me pure Aloe gel. I used it first thing in the morning, after showering, at lunch time (before the exercising stopped), right after treatment, and before bed.  My tx were at 4:00, and they wanted at least 3 hours between application and rads. I started using it with Tx #1. I also stopped wearing a bra and went with shelf bra camis bought in bulk from Costco.  With bulky sweaters over, I felt comfortable at work.  I did not wash it off.... Once the burn started (half-way through), I continued with Aloe, used Aquaphor at night & weekends (old clothes because it stains), and used whatever crap they threw at me - domeboro solution, gel pads, you name it...lidocaine when it got really bad.  A year later you can still see the lovely tan line, but no adverse skin effects.

DCIS isn't invasive and is the one BC that you can truly be cured of.  That said, only you can say what kind of risk you can live with.  Before I started radiation, my rad onc ordered another mammo to ensure everything was taken out in surgery (it was). Rads will cut my risk of recurrence in 1/2, and if I take tamoxifen, my recurrence risk will drop further. I'm only 46, and I worry about the future, but we decided to fight what I have now rather than what I could have.  Wanting to take off for a couple of years sailing certainly changes the equation and your surgeon and onc team should be able to tell you what kind of follow-up is necessary in both circumstances - that may give you your answer.  Best wishes to you.  Come visit the DCIS conversation below.

You're over 40, had your first child after age 30 (?), and have already had callbacks and one biopsy.  As far as family history of BC, many BC patients have no family history at all.  The radiation levels are so low - about as much as flying coast-to-coast - and while it is theoretically possible to get cancer from mammograms, you'd probably have to have multiple images every day for ages for that to happen.  If your center has digital mammography, the radiation levels are lower than with standard mammos. Like Beesie, I had  DCIS.  It didn't present in a lump, so without the mammogram it wouldn't have been found.  The US standard is every year after 40 and I'd rather risk the radiation from a mammogram than have a later-stage cancer found that could have been detected much earlier. It's a good idea since you had a biopsy last year & they can check for changes since then. (For me, a biopsy of a spot last year was b9 - but they saw some growth this year and did another biopsy and found pre-cancerous cells...ya never know.) Anyway - talk to your PCP or even to a radiologist (perhaps the one who did the biopsy last year). They can help you assess your risk and what is the best testing scenario that fits not only your risk profile, but your risk tolerance as well.  And that is certainly something that none of us here can come close to doing. And remember, most of us here have been through cancer and (hopefully) back, so we tend to be a bit biased...:) Take care.",

While your husband can weigh in, it is your body and your level of risk tolerance.  I've told my husband many times - he can say whatever he wants, but ultimately I am the one who has to live with it. This goes for simple things like hair cuts to complex things like surgery. Friends do not get to weigh in. Honestly, with my dx, I had no reason to consider a mastecomy, and I didn't. While rads were being debated, my rad onc took the step of setting up a 2nd opinion with a colleague, we ended up reversing initial decision & I still had rads under his care. Left side rads still carry the risk of heart and lung damage. That's what would concern me risk-wise.  You still hear of women who end up with problems so I don't think it is something to be dismissed lightly. Put all that with the distance from the clinic and it would be a hard sell for me! (My exhaustion with rads was overwhelming & there is no way I could have done it without being at home w/family.)    If you can get a good cosmetic result, a good surgical outcome (the lumps can be removed cleanly and aren't positioned so you'd need rads anyway), a risk of recurrence lower than lx + rads, and above all you want a mastectomy - then go for it. Docs can offer alternatives, but when it comes right down to it, it is your body, your cancer, your risk, your decision. It isn't like you are wanting to do some bizarre out-there treatment for cryin' out loud! And with small breasts, a lumpectomy could very well end up being as close as you can get to a full mastectomy. Paste your list back together, maybe get another opinion, but it sure sounds like you have thought it through carefully!",

In fact, my onc was very, very clear about it - while I am taking tamoxifen I either use two kinds of non-hormonal BC (condoms+spermicide), get sterilized, or husband has the big V. You will continue to ovulate and if you become pregnant, the tamoxifen can seriously damage the fetus. That said, you can stop taking tamoxifen at any time and if you took it for 2 years, went off it long enough for it to clear your system, got preg, had baby...well, it happens. There are side effects and there are risks. If I had issues with blood clots I wouldn't take it. It's really a matter of looking at your own risks and what tamoxifen can do for you. The younger you are, the less likely you are to get some of the most serious SEs (cancers, clots, strokes) associated with the drug. Things change. Your onc wants you to consider taking it in 4 years. A lot can happen in 4 years. You may have a different onc who doesn't prescribe tamoxifen (the first onc I saw didn't.) You may have more things show up or not.  You may or may not even have the same partner. Taking charge of fertility while in your early 30's is probably a good idea, though. And I'd be asking the onc if s/he was offering to set up the college fund or else keep quiet. You certainly have a lot to think about, and a lot of it is uncomfortable. Since I am the master procrastinator I would put the tamoxifen decision out of my mind for another couple of years, live as fully as I can now, keep up the monitoring, and think long and hard about children and timing. I hope it gets easier.   ",

So far, I've had a stereotactic, an ultra-sound-guided, and an MRI-guided. Maybe because they are radiology driven? Talk to them about getting in sooner - maybe if there is a cancellation.

Measure twice, cut once. The MRI did find something in my left breast which prompted an ultrasound and u/s-guided biopsy.  False positives are very common though with MRI & I was fortunate to be on the good side of 80%/20% that time.

You may want to talk to your dr about an anti-anxiety drug to take before the procedure to help calm you down. These things are tough enough without having to deal with nerves as well. For the stereotactic biopsy I was in there by myself, but for the u/s one my husband was able to be in the room with me, which was a huge comfort. 80% of the lumps and bumps turn out to be benign, so the odds are definitely on your side.

I was admitted, wheeled over to the breast center for the wire insertion (slight pain, but doctor was very good) - kept my eyes shut as much as possible, then back to the day surgery unit.  I got to put on the lovely gown, had all the vital stats taken, and the IV inserted. I do not like needles, so I kept my eyes averted. Surgery was about an hour. I woke up and was moved into recovery about an hour later. I was wrapped in the 40-ft long ace bandage for 24 hours.  Headache for awhile, but they gave me darvocet and I was fine.  Wore sweatpants and a loose shirt that buttoned up the front home. Ok. They this time they took out about a ping pong ball size of tissue and the incision is about an inch and a half long. No real pain - took pain killers for the first 36 hours - mostly discomfort. I was able to take a shower Saturday evening & remove the huge bandage, leaving only the steristrips. I wore a sportsbra 24 hours a day til I went back to work on Thursday (I am a wuss with a lot of sick leave saved up) & since then at night.  I was able to remove the steristrips yesterday (w/surgeon's permission). Incision site is kind of ugly.  The IV site still has a bit of a bruise & honestly that hurts more than the lumpectomy site.  My recovery has been relatively easy - last year's surgery was a bit worse, mostly because of the position on the breast.  I had to take it easy on lifting things, but other than some low BP issues, its ok.  I have a good surgeon and good skin, & the scar on last year's incision has faded a lot. The hospital gave me a small pillow to use to support the breast while sleeping or sitting.  No lymphedema issues for me because no lymph nodes were taken - which is pretty standard with DCIS and this LCIS nodule. Take care and good wishes for the surgery and outcome.",

Me - I was exhausted.  I did my normal eating/exercise/gym routine for as long as I could, but by week 2 the fatigue started and I ended up on medical leave. Fuzzy brain, wiped out mentally and physically. Not tired, just bone-weary.  I was off work for 6 weeks and it took probably 2-3 months before I was completely back to normal.  No residual issues. Skin still has a slight tan (1 year out), but that's it. No leathery skin, no extra firmness or anything. I got back into my gym routine as soon as I could.  (I do think there was a good part of me that just needed the respite from work and it manifested itself in rads exhaustion, but I had the med leave and disability avail, so I took it.) Take it day to day, rest when you need to, eat plenty of protein, drink lots of liquids. May you be on the easy end of the spectrum!   ",

The radiologist recommended it come out - LCIS isn't cancer, but she felt it better to remove it and then not have to worry about that particular thingy anymore.  The oncologist felt the same way.  Someone here says that the only good lump is in a jar...I'm inclined to believe her.

My treatment will be tamoxifen for 5 years and alternating mammos and MRIs every 6 months.

The only way to get rid of pure DCIS is to remove it - chemo isn't an option. Radiation will kill remaining cells.  If you have DCIS with an invasive component (which takes it from stage 0 to stage 1), it's treated as stage 1. That's where my knowledge stops as mine had no micro-invasions.  If you're ER/PR-, you can't take tamoxifen, so your treatment options could be different still. take care.",

My mom had a mastectomy 17 years ago. She had some music therapy tapes, designed to be used prior to and during surgery. They worked so well, her vitals were steady, she was so calm, had no blood loss, and was in a great state for recovery.  She credits being mentally ready for the good result. (Of course, getting through chemo and its aftermath were another story, but times and meds have changed.) I had an inkling about my DX, and I don't really know why. I remember thinking in June, before my mammo, that if something was found I'd still go on vacation, etc. The DX was a shock, but somehow I knew it would happen. Knowing what is going on and getting through each step is empowering.  Tomorrow I visit my surgeon and we'll discuss today's ultrasound and biopsy (for a tiny spot on the other breast, probably benign) and start making plans for the lumpectomy.
