I haven't put myself on the list, as I just recently found and read through this thread, but I am actually having my BMX tomorrow. I am so scared. I just keep crying today thinking about how this is my last day with this body that I know and love so well. I know my breasts let me down with the whole cancer thing, but I still love my body. :( I had neoadjuvant chemo, so the BMX is my next step toward healing. I can't get past worrying about what they will find during surgery. I am just so afraid.",

I must admit, I am having a really hard time doing so. :( Yesterday was really hard for me. I just can't stop thinking the worst, was anyone else like this? I am also having a hard time eating - I have no appetite since this worry came up. I am sleeping okay, but once a night my boys wake up {one of them seems to be haiving nightmares}, it's usually around 3am, after I go in and calm him down I start spiraling. \"Who is going to go in there and hush him if I am gone?\" \"Who is going to clip their toenails?\", it will break my heart to not hear \"Lub you mama.\" in the middle of the night after I cover him back up. I know these thoughts are unhealthy, but I can't help it. I am so angry and upset. Tomorrow morning I have my appointment with the breast specialist where they will do their own exam and review my mamma and US disc. I am scared. I want to leave with some hope. I want to enjoy the weekend before my biopsy. I know everyone keeps saying that this is the hardest part, the waiting, but I find that hard to believe when the end to the waiting could be a horrible diagnosis. I know I am a total downer, but I don't really have anywhere else to express my dark thoughts. Please forgive me for that.",

It was pretty pointless actually and it was scary being in the Cancer Center. I think they are pretty confident that it's the C-word, I am still hopeful that something else it going on and it isn't, BUT if it is - I need to HOPE and PRAY and FIGHT or the best possible outcome! Biopsy on Tuesday. Waiting does certainly SUCK!",

It's so hard not to worry and kick myself, it's in my nature already and this certainly isn't helping matters! haha! Today, I took my boys to the zoo and we had a fun day. I got sad a few times, but I am trying not to let my joy be stolen, especially when I don't even know anything yet. I am the same person I was yesterday. Yesterday I felt healthy and strong. Yesterday I was just a mom and a wife and a friend. I am still those things today. Today I also worked on getting set up with my surgeon of choice. In addition to that, I asked my NP what the radiologis thought was suspicious on the mammo and ultrasound. Basically, it seems there was an abundance of scary looking calcifications. I also asked about the node that I saw on the films and she said that it was \"larger than expected and an abnormal size\", so obviously that is concerning. Now I just need to wait for the scheduling office to call me back and get this show on the road. firegate - how did your appointment go today? Thank you for the book recommendations and the reminder to use positive self talk.",

Thank you for the story about your aunt. There are so many stories of hope out there, but it's SO HARD for me to put myself in that hopeful mindset right now. :( I just had to fill out paperwork for my consulation at the cancer center on Friday morning. It sent me into another spiral of sadness, especially the last question that asked if I had a living will. I couldn't help but wonder if every \"symptom\" I have ever had in my life is someone related to this, I hated checking off the box for \"headaches\", which I have had my whole life, and thinking that it means that I have cancer in my brain. I hated filling out that form in general. I hate that ANYONE has to fill out the form. I have a consultation with a breast specialist on Friday morning and then a biopsy scheduled for Tuesday morning. I am so scared, but so lucky to have a husband who will be there with me. I cried on the phone with the nurse, I have to wonder if they just want people to stop crying or if maybe everyone else is stronger than me and can hold it together. I am a crier, I can't help it. I want to act normal, but I can't. I love my boys. They are so perfect and pure. I just love them. I want nothing more than to grow old with my fantastic husband and hold my own grandbabies. That's all I want. It's everything.",
