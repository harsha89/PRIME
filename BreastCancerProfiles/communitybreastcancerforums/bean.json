I joined BCO in January due to a little scare about a \"thickening\" on my mamo. I had a biopsy and it's b9. I have an MRI coming in late March. Now, I'm back to this website for a much bigger scare . . . My sister was dx 9 years ago with ILC. Even back then it had already metastisized to an area in her abdomen (I'm not sure exactly where). She had a hystorectomy, chemo, radiation, and I'm sure she was given drugs but I'm not sure what. She was been declared \"in remission\" after a year. Although she has had a lot of pain in her legs, she has been living life for the last 8 years as a widow raising two boys. Last week, she (finally) went to the ER after a month of vomiting  after eating large or fatty meals. They found a \"blockage\" in her colon. Surgery confirmed that it was a BC met. Before her surgery and during all the tests the hospital was giving her, an MRI also found two \"bone lesions\". We are already convinced that these are mets as well. My sister says she's prepared to fight and go through treatment once again. She is still in the hospital recovering from her surgery and will probably go home in a few days; once she's able to have a BM. Her ONC has not yet seen her because she is still in the hospital's care. She's hospitalized for her \"blockage\", not her cancer treatment. She will see her ONC once she released from the hospital. Obviously, I am beside myself with fear . . . Fear that she may not make it for even another year. I know now that she was lucky to have already made it 9 years with metastisized BC. Her boys are now 18 and 19 years old, but they still need her! She's everything to them. I will soon have the opportunity to speak with her ONC. Even though he has not yet seen my sister, he does have all the recent test results and reports. My question to all of you: What questions should I ask the ONC when I talk to him? I can only think to ask what he thinks her prognosis is, or how long he thinks the cancer was there. Can anyone please give me some advice to the information I should try to get from him? Also, has anyone here ever have mets to their colon or bones? Thank you in advance for any advice or info you can give me. Blessings to each and everyone one of you lovely ladies!",

I know that her prognosis MAY not be good, but I am not taking that to heart and I'm not sharing the information with anyone. I don't want to scare anyone and I also know that my sister's case is her case and no one else's. She has already beat the odds by far. I've also learned that she's got positive things going for her. Those who have bones mets generally do better than those with mets on other organs. I'm not sure if the colon counts as a \"other organ\". Her cancer is also estrogen receptive and therefore grows slower (I think), and her hysterectomy helps with that as well. She also went a fairly long time before her relapse which, as I understand it, helps her longevity. I want nothing but to help her. Unfortunately, I'm 3000 miles away from her and can't help her as much as I'd like to. My mom, who also lives in another state and lived with her for a year when she was diagnosed the first time, is going back to her next week. I thank God that my mom can be there to take care of her, but I also hate to see all of this put on my mom and that my dad is being left home alone. Both my parents are in great shape, but they're getting older. I am going there for a week at the end of March, but I just wish I could be there the whole time to help her. Thanks for listening . . . and thanks for the advice. I promise not to hound her with anything. I will be there for her (although 3000 miles away) and make sure she knows that she is loved very much.",

Nothing was seen on the new mamo pics. Two areas were seen on the ultrasound although she told me that it's not the same thing they saw on the first mamo. So, the doctor is \"almost positive\" these are firbroadenoma and she recomends waiting 6 months to see if they change. This is were I'm confused . . . I'm 43. My sister, who is now 50, had invasive BC diagnosed when she was 41. My grandmother also had breast cancer. Because of my family history, I would assume that I would be considered high-risk, but they say that I'm not. I have read that fibroadenomas can be confused for cancer from ultrasound pics, so I'm surprised by the doctor's recommendation. Also, it's more common for a younger woman to develope fibroadenoma. And, I read somewhere that fibroadenomas are usually 1.5cm at least, and the larger of my two lumps is only 5mm! Despite what she thinks, I am having them biopsied in a couple weeks. I told myself that I'm not going to worry unless I have to, but I can't help it. Everything that I read tells me this is NOT fibroadenoma: It's much smaller than 1.5cm, I have a very close family history, and usually younger women get firbroadenoma. Can anyone give me some opinions? Log in to post a reply",

I opted for a biopsy (Jan 17) that came back benign. The tumors are fibroadenoma. Yesterday, I had an MRI . . . I'm nervous about the results which I get on Monday. I just felt weird when the screening was over. The nurse (Mary) that did my MRI was wonderful. She was very friendly, talkative and explained everything before and halfway into my test. Suddenly, she stopped talking so much. After my test, she didn't even come out of the little room that she and the other nurse were sitting in while I was in the MRI machine. The other nurse was the one to get me up and ready to go home. I never saw Mary again after that except through the glass upon leaving the room. She didn't look at me or say goodbye. I just thought that was odd. Another reason I'm worried is I THINK my lymph nodes under my right arm are swollen. I don't know if I'm over reacting or if they're even really swollen. I know I can feel them and they are a little tender. Does that mean they're swollen? Can you normally feel your lymph nodes anyway? Log in to post a reply",

So, the doctor I'm speaking about it the radiologist that saw my mamo and US pics and did a little US on me as well. I didn't meet her until after my second mamo and after the technologist did my ultrasound. I wasn't happy with her because she seemed to just assume she wasn't going to find anything on me rather than trying to find something. I did make sure that when I go in for my biopsy, I will have a different doctor. I want to get the biopsy in any case; even if a surgeon believes I don't need one. My sister had invasive lobular carcinoma which I learned can sometimes be tricky to see on ultrasound. I also read something about cancer developing around fibroadenoma. I am going to ask them to biopsy the surrounding area. I also want a rescan in 6 months. I also plan to speak to a breast surgeon (my gynecologist refer me to) and see what he thinks. Thank you for the link. I will certainly look into that! AND find out what my Bi-Rad rating is. The breast center is supposed to be a good one. Anyway, they base their high risk determination on a formula that they use. I have actually found similiar formulas on-line and according to them, I'm not high risk either. It's because I started my period later than most (14) and had kids earlier than most (23). I think if you have a first degree relative that was dx, it should null any of the other \"factors\".

He didn't find it to be fibroadenoma? Also, how does a core biopsy of a fibroadenoma discover surrounding cancer? That makes me think that it takes samples of the areas outside the fibroadenoma.  Maybe I just need to do a little research on these differnet types of biopsies. I don't care what I have to go through. If there's cancer there, I don't want them to miss it. Maybe I should ask them to take them both out.",

My sister had invasive lobular carcinoma, which is hard to pick up in mamos and ultrasounds because it normally doesn't form a lump. It grows more like a spidar web and looks like a density. The more I read, the more I'm not too concerned about the fibroadenoma, but am scared of this ILC. I'm afraid they will miss a cancer in that might be in the surounding area.
