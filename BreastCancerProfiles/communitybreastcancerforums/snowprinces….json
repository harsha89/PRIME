Had my first chemo last Thurs (9/7) and was more managable that I expected it to be.  Generally just felt a bit off ALL the time, and have to eat constantly or feel really nauseous so am convinced that I will be the size of a heifer by the time I am finished!  Other SE - really dry mouth and sore throat, some thrush (yay!), heartburn and tiredness but all very manageable.  Oh and most importantly am up to day 7 and NO hair falling out.  Might be complete wishful thinking but hoping maybe it will stay that way? Had a question for the group re: PICC lines vs a Port (posted a seperate reply on this) so any advice would be much appreciated. Have a great day Meg ",

Am praying that it stays this way that I just lose it all down there and none on top!!! o2bHealthy - am thinking of you and hoping you are feeling better PS173 - Love your attitude girl - kick butt Joanie - I too had a decision between port and PICC and have chosen PICC because less maintentance and less obtrusive Hopingforacure - I get what you are going through.  My mum has had both breast cancer (I was 12) and bowel cancer (I was 25) and I am only 28 and going through it myself! Gearing myself up for treatment two next week and thinking of you all Hugs and kisses Meg",

Treatment is 3 x FEC and 3 x Taxotere plus herception but going on a trial so not sure what that will look like yet.  So Jayne in UK I think you and I are the only ones on this treatment?  What were the bad days for you?  Its really helpful to read how everyone else is coping and I wish you all the very best!

SallieMae - Welcome so glad to see you joined us.  Your daughter is a very funny lady and regularly cracks me up but its so unfair that you both have to go through this.  Will be thinking of you. Take care everyone else and have a good few days!",
