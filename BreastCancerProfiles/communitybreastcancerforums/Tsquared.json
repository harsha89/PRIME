    "Content": "Tsquared wrote: hello, I am 28 years old, Ever since I stopped my birth control 7 months ago, I've had pain in my breasts. It is most prominent and sharp in the right one, and it Is constant and does not go away through my cycle. Also, I stopped using anti perspirant and started using deoderant- and I find that the odour under my right arm does not stay away , I have to re apply deoderant every few hours. Should I be concerned? I have no symptoms of breast cancer that I can see. Log in to post a reply",
