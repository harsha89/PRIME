Carbs, carbs, carbs... pototoes, pasta, bread and yogurt! I am normally a salt lover...add salt to most things.  But after chemo for about 10 days, salt anything burns my mouth and tastes awful!  I have super cut down on the sodium intake...that must be a good thing.  Plus, lots of water!!!!  Mrsb...happy birthday! I hope you had some birthday cake! Sounds good! I had my first chemo two days before my birthday...kind of a strange b-day, but, I'll never forget that one.  Neither will you!  I guess having today's AC be the last on in that series today is a GREAT way to celebrate! Yay! You're now done with that chapter and moving on to the final Taxol x 12 weeks!  I hope your arm will be better very soon...!

That would be nice... Anita, keep us posted about your foot...and what's this about your wig?  How long do you wear it for?  You have it attached, then removed/cleaned, and then reattached?  Is that a lace wig?  How long does it last? Can you wash you hair in it, or, how does it work?  Very interesting... I agree Lisaa401...working full time has been very helpful for me.  I work in HR, so I am a caregiver of my employees (taking care of them all the time).  Sometimes I feel likeI am everyone's mother here, kind of funny.  I love my job and everyone has been so supportive. I have only missed work on chemo days because those treatments take about 7 hours, plus one bad day due to the steriods.  I keep hearing that we should anticipate the possibility of at least one hospitalization during this process (fever/infection/blood transfusion)...but it sounds like we are all getting through this without that intervention (unless I missed someone?)...we need to stay healthy, eat healthy with the holidays coming ... I hope none of us get this H1N1 flu...are you all getting the flu shot?  I was talking to a nurse that is on chemo and she told me that it is senseless to get it as during chemo, we are unable to produce antibodies, and the chemo pretty much wipes out the inactive anti virus. Others say \"yes\", get the flu vaccine. Seems there are two schools of thought out there? Regardless, I hope none of us falls ill during this time and come though shiny :)  Are any of you making plans for Halloween? What do you think about that? My friend was suggesting I be a frightening nurse and wear a mask that filters viriuses and wear gloves and actually go to a party.  My next chemo (#4) is in 10/29/09...two days before the party.  Trying to decide if I dare bother. :)  What will you be doing?",

I had 3x the dosage I should have had, and they didn't titrate (taper) me off the steriods.  I remember it being bad after the first chemo, but nothing like the second.  I hear it has a cumulative effect (all of it).  I thought it was the chemo until the 2nd Onc explained what happens with too much steriod.  Chemo #3 is this Thursday and the steriods will be dramatically reduced.  I have seen first hand a woman go into anaphylactic shock from the Taxotere, and it was FRIGHTENING, so, there is a reason they want to give us these steriods.  Just not too much!! I think the steriod part of the treatment is almost worse than the chemo.  This is why I said that \"there is life after steroids\".  I call it steroid hell...HORRIBLE. Brie...I understand the depression.  Please tell your Onc about this to make sure it's not from the steriods.  I was embarrassed and almost didn't mention this to my 2nd opinion Onc, but when I explained all my symptoms, he took down a list of all my meds and we found out that I had had way too much steroid medication, thus, the unhappy mental state (I almost called 911 as I have never felt like that in my life...I thought it was the chemo).  I don't want to scare you, but the steriods can have a very strong impact on your mental well-being.  When did you go off the steriods?  They take 7-12 days to work out of your system.   Please hang tough...you will get through this.  I hear the neoadjunt treatment is among the more higher quality forms of treatment, so hang in there. Yes, it is very frustrating to find out some of these things in the boards.  I cannot help but wonder if the Onc/NP doesn't tell us what to expect/what may happen as they are afraid of the placebo effect (which to me is a crock as when things happen, we generally \"dismiss\" it, or think we are crazy)... chime in when something doesn't seem right.  You are your best advocate (I know you know that, but it bears repeating for me to hear myself...there's no point in suffering or going this alone). Hopbird... oh joy! Don't you just love the hip pain from those WBC booster shots they give us!!?  Ugh!  hugs to you all....",

On to the new rads horizon, continuing Herceptin for a year, trying to get into the SWOG 0307 and Hormone therapy and hopefully HAIR! Gosh...I really miss the hair!  Hugs to you all...  I am moving over to Onty's Rads board now.  Maybe some of you will join us there.  BEST WISHES XOXOXO <3 <3 <3",

I am sure my liver is screaming for relief...poor little guy. So, I just do not bother with the pain relievers at this point...the Claritin is the only thing I can take, and I only take it when I think I need it, it seems to really help with the Neupogen shots, which is clearly objective (not in our head that it works).

Quick update for me:  About 4 weeks ago I had some swelling and strong pain in my breast (the same one where the creeper was) as the pinpoint location where the incision was.  I read in here (in the general articles) that if a pain comes, watch it for two weeks; if it doesn't abate, call your onc.  Well, mine peaked around day 8-10 and I had real pain.  This wasn't the normal breast tenderness you get with menstruation (even though I have not had that in a long ass while, I still recall!).  It bothered me and since I had not seen my onc since I finished Herceptin in August 2010, I made an appt. So...while the pain is gone, he has me down for an ultra sound exam of the breast and a PET scan (never had one of those).  Possibilities are that the pain was attributable to scar tissue, or perhaps some fluid (as I had swelling) built and then subsided.  I won't get these tests for about 2 weeks.  But, am curious, did any of you have something similar to this, after the fact? Happy New Year!!!",

It was falling out in clumps and I was convinced it would all be gone, so, we shaved it off with a guard. Since cutting it off (also a most horrible day for me), the hairs that remained (about 30%) have continued to grow.  I don't understand it? I have not heard from anyone that they lost all their hair...I always had a lot of hair, but it is fine. It seems the finest hairs have remained...I have not lost any hair on my arms (which are also fine and blonde).  It seems the fine, lighter hairs have hung around. My hair is definitely more dense on top, too...it's the sides that are sparse and you can see my scalp when looking.  But, I don't have enough to go without a headcover.  But, this is NOTHING like the full head of hair I used to have.  Most definitely.  I cannot wait to be done with chemo and already have week 20 from PFC marked on my calendar as my \"hopeful\" time to have something normal sprouting on my head. Like you, I practically pee myself thinking that I am 1/2 way done (three to go...next one on 10/29, then 11/17 and finally 12/10...ceteris paribus!!). I am prepared to lose my eyebrows and eyelashes sometime in December, as it seems everyone loses theirs a couple/three weeks post the final chemo? I am sure all of you had some hair on your head through chemo, right? Did you all get slow growth on your legs and underarms?  I won't get into the sparse private region!!! LOL",

It starts gradually, and then clumps over 2-5 days :(  I remember sobbing in the shower...  my hair is the one thing I had as a woman that made me feel feminine.  I was able go coverless for the first time in mid March 2010 (really) with about 3/4 inch of hair (but my scalp was covered, dark...no empty skin spots).  I had my first hair coloring on 4/10/10, along with a trim and ended up at close to 2 inches...I went to Coachella to party it up with my friends...  I had my hair touched up again last weekend as I have had so much growth...close to 3 inches now.  I hear that once we stop the Herceptin, it grows REALLY fast (I am telling you this as you are on the same treatment as me).  I wish I knew how to post a photo so you could see... :)  Just remember it grows back...  I'll admit, I went to a party last Saturday and out of about 40 girls, I was the ONLY one with short hair. I felt like I stood out like a sore thumb, but no-one seemed to notice or care.  I wasn't treated any differently. I may not \"feel\" as pretty with shorter hair, but it seems no-one really cares :)  It is difficult going out there at first...you definitely have to work more on the facial make-up... but it is doable, and gets better every week. And I would swear my eye-lashes are fuller and longer than they ever have been.  I keep waiting for them to fall out again...I hope they don't, and sofar, they haven't. Regarding new hair growth... I remember picking my \"date\" that I fully expected to have enough hair to go topless (I picked early April...5 months PFC...which I thought/hoped would be realistic based upon all the other posters in this forum). I ended up being able to start going coverless a month sooner, in mid March :)  Which really surprised me. I don't know if using the Nioxin helped (used the scalp treatment, shampoo and conditioner), or the vitamins I started taking three weeks after chemo...I tend to be a cynic, but I figured it couldn't hurt and my Onc didn't have any concerns with them (I showed him the bottles).  Looking forward really helps, picking a date and planning something special for yourself at about 5 months PFC is a super nice carrot.  I don't know...it really helped me...  now I am counting down the weekly H's!  I cannot wait to get the port removed come September...that's my next countdown :)  What's your countdown to 5 months PFC? :)",

Thank you littlered and ChrisC433...your positive affirmations are the perk I needed today.  I went to work with a nicer scarf today and no-one stared or made me feel weird.  Very supportive.  People are telling me I look nice (I think they are being kind, but it does not matter, at least they are kind, and this is what truly matters). Rachel, you are too funny with the Uncle Chester and Guinan reference.  You got me thinking \"Ch-Ch-Ch-Chia!\"... maybe I can put some sprouts on my head and grow 'em...the newest rage in Chia Pets. Thank you jancie, hrf and stef58 for your thoughts, too... Laughing a LOT today... a day before chemo #3 Thanks guys!!! xoxoxo  Just what I needed today, really. <3 ",

Unfortunately, I found about them too late and already missed out on my first chance to use them (had my first Taxotere/Carboplatin/Herceptin) treatment on 8/27/09 and my hair started to sparse two days ago...I am getting my hair cut very short tomorrow.  I am going to venture into using the Cold Caps with next week's treatment on 9/17/09 in hopes of minimizing any further damage to the hair follicles, and, based on what the represenative from Cold Caps told me, I should expect to see the regrowth of my lost hair start to come back in a couple of months.  The US number for Penguin Cold Caps is 714-982-8846.  Regarding availability, I am not sure. My set is available to me locally as I am taking them over from a woman that is finishing up with her rental (lucky soul!); the Cold Caps baton is being passed to me.  These Neupogen shots are nocking me off my socks...anyone else have SE with these shots? I feel like I have a bad flu, but fortunately no fever! :) ",

I am so happy for her! I just received a call from Penguins Cold Caps and they said that sadly, as I already had my first treatment with unprotected hair follicles (sounds like I had unprotected sex and now am getting an STD!), my hair cannot be saved.  This is very sad...so many people do not need to lose their hair. I wish you all the best with your regrowth...actually I am right behind you...\"way\" behind you hugs...",
