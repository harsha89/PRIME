I can tell you I have aches and pains, but I heard it's the healing process and the nerves growing.",

      "Content": "May 1, 2015 07:37PM - edited May 2, 2015 10:43PM by happynewyorker Hi DizzParkMom, I know when I was told I had breast cancer in January of this year (2015), I already had accepted it and make jokes. My way of not getting upset and thinking positive. I had my mastectomy on February 19, 2015 on my right breast. Had some lymph nodes removed and the cancer hadn't spread.  I also did a genetic testing done and found I have a gene that suggests I may get colon cancer.  I found for myself that keeping a journal as this is just another chapter in your life (my 11 year told me about the chapter), I keep pictures of my breast before, with the expanders and the process.  I'm at the end and scheduled for reconstructive surgery on May 15, 2015.  The process I hate to say is very painful. Skin stretching hurts.  My breast looks like a little football, but feels like I'm carrying a large basketball.   With regards to not receiving information from your doctor's I have in the past (not experienced this with my cancer) reported the doctors.  Nothing wrong with doing this.  It just reminds them that they need to step up to the game when doing their job. I've never had the chemo, but I heard in the beginning it's rough and once you know it, it will be over and hopefully you don't need surgery.  Keep a journal. I was told earlier this year from my breast surgeon that many women that have breast cancer consider it a personal ordeal.  I don't agree!  I found this website after having my surgery, and it helps a bit with information.  Writing to express your feelings helps 100%, and I hope it helps you. I can only say, stay as strong as you can.  If you can get a genetic testing, I found out insurance companies won't pay for them (but from posts below: It depends on the insurance company).  Mine cost $250, which to me was worth finding if I was going to get any inherited cancers.  best regards, and keep posting.

I'm 51, I have an 11 year old daughter, I don't believe I will live to be 100, but I know that knowing that the genetic testing that I did shows I may get colon cancer.  I have new rules to follow, I will follow them as I want to see my daughter graduate from school, college, grow to a young adult and adult.  Knowing to me makes my quality of life a lot better, knowing that I can change my life style and how I eat and care for myself, to make my future a healthier one.  Sample:  I had a mastectomy, I'm in the last stages before having surgery for reconstructive surgery.  I'm not take Tamoxifen, as I had DCIS, stage 0 breast cancer. I was told if I don't take Tamoxifen my chances of getting breast cancer on my left breast is 14%.  I went to a breast cancer meeting group at the hospital I had my surgery.  I met a women that had the same cancer and also was in the process of having the reconstructive surgery. She told me that they told her the chances of getting breast cancer if not taking Tamoxifen was 13%, she got cancer the next year. She doesn't have the BRACA gene, but her sister was diagnose with breast cancer this year and does. When she told me this it surprised me then she said her reconstructive surgery didn't take for her.  At first I didn't want to hear anymore, but realized that her body is different than mine. She has a pigmentation disease and probably has other problems.  But such as life, we are all different, many have different cancers. We all deal with our cancer differently. Many move on and try to close that chapter in their lives. Where others, what to share their experience. You're pregnant you are given the choice to find out if your child will be healthy or not.  Many people want to know.........    ",
