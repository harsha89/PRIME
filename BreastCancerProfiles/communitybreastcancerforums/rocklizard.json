So far, I know I want a copy of the pathology roport from the excision. I want to ask what the FEA means for the future (higher risk? more biopsies and excisions in the future? more frequent or more detailed mammograms?). My mom swears she didn't take DES before I was born, but she had a miscarraige right before me and I had lots of reproductive problems (which can come from DES).  This would double my bc risk, and I want to know what she thinks of this.  The other thing I want to know is what does she think I should do to cut down on my future risk (something I had never taken nearly so seriously before!).  If I did and didn't do everything that was recommended I'd be a basket case, so I want to know what things have science or logic behind them.  I'm already considering giving up grilled meats, and that sucks because I love to grill and we have been eating grilled fish and chicken several times a week. Can you think of anything else I should talk to her about?  She is really good but incredibly busy so this is my shot at her.  Mar '12 odd mammo, microcalc on u/s, Mar '12 stereotactic biopsy FEA, Apr '12 wire-guided excision.

I understand exactly what you mean about knowing that your child is the most important thing in your life, the reason you do what you do.  My clarity, rising at my most awful time, was that what was most important in my life is my daughter (5yo), that I want to watch and help her grow up.  Everything else doesn't come close.  I had some really intense, serious conversations with my husband, and in one I told him that if something happened to me I wanted him to remarry, but only to someone who would love my daughter as their own beloved child.  It's amazing how the fluff burns at this time, and you see what is at your core. During my time in procedures and tests I took all the prayers and positive energy and good wishes I could get.  This time needs everything you can throw at it and more.    Know that I am thinking about you tonight and tomorrow, and wishing you an easy procedure and fast, happy results.  {{hugs}} Elizabeth",

Several women on the board have mentioned that anti-anxiety drugs helped them get through the first while after being diagnosed.  You sound like me in that you get very anxious and I would be getting them right now.  I used them during the wait, and they helped.  For me, I do much, much better when I can keep the tension and stress down, and that's not easy for me.

      "Content": "Apr 9, 2012 12:22AM rocklizard wrote: I had one done last Wednesday.  Mine was for microcalc and flat atypical epithelial cells, not a lump, but it was a wire localization and excision.  My oncology surgeon, Johnson in Portland OR, operates in the afternoon (guess she likes it that way) so my surgery was at 3:30 pm.  I'd had a radioactive isotope image done two days before, and they'd seen something on the other breast (left one, surgery was on my right - news of that was NOT welcome) so I had to go in at 9 am so they could ultrasound that area before the surgery.  That way, if there was anything suspicious there she could biopsy/excise it at the same time.  Very effecient, these surgeons :-)  Actually, I wanted it all done at the same time if they had to.  Got there at 9 and they got me in my hospital gown.  The ones here have a place to plug in a tube like a hair-drier tube that heats up the whole gown.  Super spifferino and kept me really warm and cozy the whole time.  I had taken a Xanax at home because I am a stress biscuit big time.  They started an IV and I asked for a valium.  I had a really good book on tape so I listened to that.  I had also brought some meditations on my phone. I was most nervous about the wire localization because it sounded both painful and bizarre. At 11am they came to get me for the ultrasound of the left side and the wire localization (or, the wire-in-the-boob-procedure).  Ultrasound was simple.  Then the wire thingy.  I was super nervous, but the doc to do that was the same one who did my biopsy and that was almost painless (during and after) so that helped a bit.  They turned me almost on my side and I listened intently to my CD book.  I was waiting for the stinging of the lidocain and the feeling of the wire going in.  Honestly, I didn't feel either.  I could feel them over there doing something, and sometimes they pushed a bit on the breast, kind of like when hubby is getting really frisky, but that's it and then it was over.  The wire is really, really thin and they just taped the end above my breast.  They did an easy mammogram (no squeezing) to be sure the placement of the wire was good, then back to my room. Next waiting until 3:30 for the surgery.  Hubby read his SF book and I listened to my mystery and dozed (heated gown and warm blankets and xanax and 2 vallium).  I was expecting it to actually start after 3:30 since I'd heard that late surgeries usually do and that Johnsons was really thorough so often she was late.  But, at 3:30, she and OR nurse and anesthesiologist show up in the room, give a starter sedative, and hi-ho, to the OR where they put me right out (surgery was done under light anesthesia).  Woke up happy back in the room.  They gave me crackers and water and let me go home when I could go to the bathroom on my own and pee - took about 30 - 45 minutes.  Did find out the left side wasn't a problem when doc looked at the ultrasound, so only had the right side done. I had a Narco there, and one the next morning, but didn't really need them.  Since then I've taken 2 asperin occaisionally.  I went for a long walk the day after and felt fine.  Since I didn't have a lump, they may have taken out less than other women have had, but the excision was a breeze.  Now I have the waiting part, I should know by this coming Wednesday.  The surgeon had a good feeling about it, so I'm hopeful and not too stressed, but I'm also getting better (I think) at compartmentalizing and not thinking about it.  I was much more stressed after the needle biopsy. Good luck with your excision biopsy.  I'm hoping for an easy one for you, too, and b9 results for us both. ",

I didn't need to take many of the drugs because I found a relaxation hypnosis video on line (if you're interested I can give you the link).  I watched it every night for days before and after my biopsy and it worked as well as the ambian.  And I got a massage and had a hypnosis session since that has worked for me before for medical anxiety.

I'll be watching the board to see what you find out on Thursday.  I see my surgeon on Friday for a follow-up.  I realized I don't know exactly what they said I have and I want to know what this means for the future, and I need a copy of my pathology report (I keep forgetting to get those).  Shachar, good luck on your biopsy.  I'll be thinking of you on Friday.  I hope it's all easily explained stuff.",

      "Content": "Apr 11, 2012 09:49AM - edited Apr 11, 2012 09:58AM by rocklizard Hi Shayne.  I'm so sorry you are going through this and I completely understand the crushing worry that goes with it  I can't imagine that not happening. I too was totally scared of just the procedure, with the results being an extra worry. I'm sending you positive energy and hugs and my wishes for b9 results. I had microcalcs on my mamm and u/s.  The floor dropped out from under me at that moment.  I was told I needed to have a stereotactic biopsy  I am the wimpiest of the wimps when it comes to medical stuff, and took xanax for several days before and the morning of.  When I got there, they saw my face and told me to take another xanax :-)  Then they did the procedure and I barely felt anything.  I've had hangnails that have hurt worse, both the during and the after.  I did have an excellent doctor do it, which probably helped.  Waiting afterwards for results 2 days later was excruciating.  I don't remember that much about the procedure, other than lying on a table with my boob hanging down.  Nothing hurt, maybe a small prick of a needle.  It was really fast. They did find FEA (80% chance it would be nothing) in the biopsy (even just the word \"biopsy\" is ugly and scary), but an excision later showed it all b9 (90% chance of that).  Even the excision was easy, except for my worrying.  Your chances are excellent that it won't be any problem and all will be b9 in the biopsy.  They are just being extra careful and they can find so much more in mammo and u/s than they used to be able to. During my waiting time I did take some anxiety meds, but I also found a great self-hypnosis video on u-tube (I can send you a message with the link if you want, or it's in the thread Roxie1 started), got a massage,  had some hypnosis, had my naturopath give me some herbal anxiety remedies, and those things helped a lot.  And I began to think of the team of doctors as a \"team\", working together to help me get through this, and that helped me, too. And this board was a god-send, just an amazing gathering place and resource. Elizabeth",

The wait is the absolute pits, I am not sorry to be out of that.  I hope the meditation link has helped you with that.  Have you gotten your results yet? Is the OSU in your name for Oregon State University?  I worked down there for a while and loved it.  Sending happy thoughts your way.    Elizabeth ",

I don't see my surgeon until the 20th to talk about the results and what the FEA means for my future.  Her assistant told me I could go back to whatever screenings I was doing before, which was yearly, but I want to know more about what it means and what we need to look for.  This has changed me and made me hyper-aware of what is going on in my body. Let me know what your surgeon says and what your report says.  I'm interested and I want to compare it to what my surgeon says.  I'm sorry your aunt has IDC, and that must have made your wait for results harder. Ah, the other OSU.  Oregon State University started going by Oregon State (OS) informally so it wouldn't be confused with the 'big school'. ",

That said, I'm glad it's most probably a very early stage.  I'm sure that doesn't help very much right now and may not be what you want to hear, but very treatable is very good. About talking to your daughter, I know there are books out there to help.  My daughter's preschool teacher gave me the name of a book for talking to young kids about it, that I can pass on to you if I want.  Please let me know how you are doing if you can and feel up to it.  You'll know more on Thursday.  I'm thinking about you. ",
