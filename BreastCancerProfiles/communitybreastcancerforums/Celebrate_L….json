I need to work on my treatments and document it. I am er/pr+, her2- I have had most treatments, many 2 or 3 times. We are starting to run out of drugs.... I think one of the things that had helped me most is drinking lots of water. My goal every day is to drink half my body weight in fluid ounces of water daily. Sometimes it is water, sometimes it is green tea, but I strive to obtain that goal. I believe it has helped me flush the toxins out and have kept side effects minimal, therefore being able to stay on treatments longer. Keeping stress down is key too. Therese ",

New bone mets in scapula, ribs and spine. Scapula and ribs are new. No pain, so that is good. TM have jumped, so this isn't shocking, just disappointing. Will be starting Navelbine next week.

The pseudo cirrhosis was my biggest concern, because fighting two diseases is much harder than one. I am still waiting for all the results from the liver biopsy. I am thinking that because the liver tumor is 5 cm, it has to have some effect on the texture of the liver itself. I will find out more at the end of the month. ðŸ˜Š ",

Has anyone had a laparoscopic liver biopsy???? Therese",

I found this article that explains how it works and found it very interesting. It also gives me more hope. I just started it on Saturday, so we will see what happens. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/... Shana, my doctor looks at both scans and TM. Some peoples marker count is not always indicative of what is truly happening with the cancer.  Therese",

I decided I wanted a lemon tree because, the thought then, was it helps your body be more alkaline. So I went to the nursery to get a lemon tree and they told me it would be 4-6 YEARS before I would get lemons. So, I left the lemon tree at the nursery. A couple of months later, I had the opportunity to get a free lemon tree. I said, why not? The first spring I had blooms and lemons grew. I realized, it wasn't going to be my time, until it was my time. Here I am 10 years later with my lemon tree. Try to focus on something else besides the numbers. It is challenging, but doable. One year it was my grandson being born. This year it was my grandson going to kindergarten. Right now, I have another grandbaby due in March. My immediate goal is to play pickleball next Monday. So, I have to get my strength back up from the sepsis, by walking more. And learn to enjoy the moments. One minute, one hour, one day. I hope this helps. Therese",
