From my understanding, enhancement means it 'lit up' with the contrast during the MRI. I read that the nipples can sometimes light up but only one nipple lit up so that's why I'm confused. I would feel better if they both did or if they both didn't...plus it's in the painful boob! I guess it's no big deal or it wouldn't be classified as benign lol. If only I went to school to be a radiologist instead of a grade school teacher...the irony is that I spent my first semester of college in an x-ray tech program (I realize that's not the same thing).",

Ravzari, I am so glad to hear that you had much denser tissue and more pain in one breast than the other (not that I am glad you were in pain). It's just that my right breast doesn't hurt and is not lumpy at all. This pain hit me from out of the blue so I have been so worried. Breast cancer runs rampid through my family. No one I talk to seems to understand how painful this is! I can barely wear my bra or lay flat on my stomach and I'm not large chested. I'm just glad to hear that this is 'normal.' Thanks for your reply. Hopefully my mind can rest now.",

I have been posting on here for months and I hope that I don't offend anyone by posting here again. I have a long list of things going wrong in my body, but it all started after I started having pain in one breast. I don't know if it is related to my breast or something different entirely. I woke up suddenly in May with pains in my left breast. It felt almost as if it had been injured because it was so sore. Since then I have had stabbing and burning pains all in the same breast. I have since found out that I have four cysts in that breast and none in the other. I know that it is more tender just before my cycle but I do still have the stabbing pains throughout the month. The breast is noticably larger than the other, more so before my cycle, but remains larger all month. I am concerned about IBC as the breast is so much larger than the other, but no actual lumps have been found aside from cysts and increased areas of fibrosis. I've seen 3 breast specialists who have dismissed these concerns, and I want to believe them- truly! I'm just wondering if this sounds normal of fibrocystic breasts. For one breast to be affected and not the other, and also to have more pain before a cycle, but still have considerable amounts of stabbing pain throughout the month. The nipple also looks different than the other. When I take my bra of it looks 'spread out' but the other does not. I know that you can't diagnose me, I guess I'm just hoping someone will say, \"Yes, I have one cyclical lumpy breast and not the other that also gives me stabbing pains throughout the month totally apart from my cycle!\" I have had innumerable health concerns pop up in the last few months and it is destroying my life. I'm just hoping it is not connected to my weird boob. I hope that no one finds me annoying or disrespectful for posting another question. Log in to post a reply",

I actually had lymph nodes pop up all over my body so the general surgeon I was seeing wanted to rule out lymphoma by doing a biopsy of one. He took one from my opposite armpit because it was bigger (still only 1.2 cm). He told us he got the largest one from there. Results were benign \"sinus histiocytosis.\" Doing a google search of \"sinus histiocytosis\" I found that this is a common finding adjacent to cancer (ugh!) or due to infection. He told me it is a perfectly normal finding but I still don't know what to think of it. I wish he had taken a node from the armpit of the breast I was having problems with but he was thinking lymphoma not breast cancer so he wanted the biggest node he could feel.",

I am mostly worried that if I do end up with a cancerous lump, I won't be able to recognize it because my breasts are so lumpy! I already know that they are extremely dense. They are so dense that they could not even find 4 good sized (1 cm or larger) cysts in my mammo and one of the ultra sounds. So even if I do routine screening every 6 months as advised, I will have to argue for at least an ultra sound but preferably breast MRI (which is very expensive). Sigh, I am beginning to think that they will have to go! I don't think that my husband will really be against it. He knows that this is causing me pain, but you are right. It is up to me in the end! I would say at 25 I am probably pretty young to be thinking about a preventative mastectomy, but I am in a lot of pain and I do have breast cancer in my family. I will definitely consider this if not for now then a couple of years down the road. If there is anything nasty hiding in there that is probably going to be the only way they will find it!
