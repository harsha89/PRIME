This was done by a radiologist. If there's a lump, a breast surgeon can do a quicker needle biopsy. Both are done under a local anesthetic. Do find the best comprehensive breast center in your area that your insurance covers, and have the diagnostic tests done there by a breast surgeon. It might affect your prognosis, and is likely to affect your treatment options.",
