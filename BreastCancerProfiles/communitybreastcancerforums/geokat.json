Do atypical cells always turn into cancer?  What are the odds?  Can't I just monitor my breasts with frequent tests and avoid treatment (I have 2 small children....I'm only 39).  I'm waiting to hear from oncologist, but I want to know my odds.  I want to know if I can avoid cancer or is it inevitable.  I'm so scared.............
