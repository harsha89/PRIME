He has a clinic close the Schonbrun palace in Vienna, which is very nice area. Here the patients firsr get tested for CTC-cells and also he send the tumor sample for molecular testing to Bojar laboratory in Dusseldorf in Germany. Based on this data and your objective finding he plans treatment, which is usuaÄºly in 6 weeks intervals. I dont have any tumor now since I had resection in november. My liver metastasis was different from original tumor, lost PR rceptor and ki67 went donw from 40% to 10%. Acording molecular report grade 1. Original was 2-3. My tumor mutation burden was low as well. No interesting mutations at all. FoundationOne report said equivocal for CDK 4/6 inhibitors so I did not started yet. May be later if necessary. So if the patient has high grade he gives metronomic low dose chemo, acording the sensitivity test. I had taurolidin, vit c, alphalipooic acid infusions and local hypertermia on my liver. Than two weeks of nivoluma, and now one week of fever. It is manageable. I will ask him tonight your question about imugenicity of ER/PR + tumors Zarovk",

You do everything to save your life so you really deserve it. My daugher is also 11, like yours. My son will be 18. I need to be there for her at least untill she is 18. I think that local treatment is very important so you should stick with it. Taxanes are also very good option. My friend had also low dose taxanes for liver mets, it shrinked her mets from 11 to 4 and these four are the same for whole year. She is ER positive but she stopped taking antihormonals and takes some homeopatics from poissonous mushroom (Amanita phaloides), I am not sure if this does any good to her, but she is doing great and her mets did not change for more than year. I had resection in November for single met and now after MRI in march my liver is clean. I know it is only four months but I am happy for that, so I think there is reason to do local treatments. My met was grade 1 and no one would give me chemo after the resection (I actually asked for it), only hormonals (exemestan). I dont know how the hypertermia and Opdivo helped since I am in remission from the operation. Some of my T lymphocytes populations went up. And I wish to everybody good treatments working. I support the liver with milk thistle as well, takeing cannabis suppositoria for night, CBD, kurkumin, Vit D and Vit C",
