I had consulted a cardiologist during chemo to sort of get a baseline, as I was worried about the effects of treatment on my heart. (family history of heart problems - although I had not had any yet). I had an angiogram in Nov while still in chemo that showed a small blockage in an artery on the front of my heart that was less than 50% closed.  Before the end of rads in the following March, I found that the blockage had progressed to more than 95% and they wanted to give me open heart surgery ASAP. My cardiologist worked at MDAnderson and flat told me that the rapid change was because of the left side radiation damaging the artery. Heart and/or artery damage can be long term side effect or short term. Or both. Lucky me, I got a dangerous stent 6 wks later instead of the open heart surgery (they decided that healing would be problematic due to the radiation effects on skin/tissue) And so far, it's working fine.  You really need to see a cardiologist. I hope that's not your problem, but it could be.",
