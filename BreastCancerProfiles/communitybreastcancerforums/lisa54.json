No reconstruction in site for the future, as yet, but I do feel frustrated because I have not chosen a prosthesis. I am a nurse and I have heard many women say that a prosthesis is \"too heavy\". It depresses me to look at my flat skin where my breast used to be. I hate to take a shower, and have not had the courage to seek a prosthesis. So, I have been using a water balloon! The only thing is that when I bend over sometimes it falls out and I am so depressed. What kind of prosthesis is best?  I have been told so many different things.",
