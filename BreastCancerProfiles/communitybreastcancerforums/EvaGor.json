Of course it may depend on your own oncologist. If you ask me, it's good that you got the referral. Palliative care workers are usually much better when it comes to pain treatment since their main focus is to keep you comfortable. Hugs.",

I had a discussion with my oncologist and she did not feel that a bilateral mastectomy would make a huge difference in terms of recurrence/survival. Symmetry is not that important to me as long as my boob and foob are not drastically different. It probably helps that my breasts were never large to begin with. My left breast was removed in July with a TE placed, and I had a right breast lift at the same time. I currently have full sensation in my right nipple.",
