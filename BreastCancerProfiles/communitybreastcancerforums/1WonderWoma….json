I also respect that healthcare is different all over but can't you request and PAY for the mammo yourself as a preemptive measure?  I know here all the limits are imposed by insurance companies relative to what age you need to be to get a mammo.  If you want to have one and pay for it yourself, it would seem odd that you could not get one but I have only ever lived in the US and, again, I am completely unclear of what options might be available to you. Good luck and keep us posted-",

I don't know what is going on!!!!!!! Joystars: your spirit is beautiful! I love it and I am very happy your pregnancy is progressing just splendidly! You are doing just great and are so positive it is just wonderful...and your baby knows it, too! Getty-they did say when the fills start they will move back to where they are supposed to be but my PS is on vaca next week so 10 more days with drains ...woe is me! For spite I am going to lift weights and chow up some gummi worms!!!! JBL-speaking of body image, I am so with you. Mine were never right...one was bigger than the other...noticeably. One wanted to look ahead and the other must have been depressed b/c it liked to look down!!! I will also never forget, I was 13 years old, my father was a single parent, I was walking to school with some friends and I mentioned that my dad had to take me to the doctor that afternoon and one nasty witch said \"what? To get your boobs fixed?!\" Cruel kids especially b/c my dad was raising me! It was not something a 13 yr old girl wanted to talk about with her father! So I am with you...no more bras and matching foobs....I am ok with this!!!! Congrats on your drain removal! I am so tired of these! Robin-my healthy friend (soon to be ex!!) tried to get me interested in fruit snacks today? WHA? I said gummi worms dammit! That would be the equivalent of your friends trying to get you off of sweet popcorn onto rice cakes!!! Um..no! BTW, about the Xmas tassles, my friends are having a lot of fun with comments like \"which will guide the sleigh!\" Perhaps I will put Christmas bulbs in there! Reneemac-I am so glad you had some sleep on the air mattress and then that darn thing designed to avoid a human barbecue woke you up alarming you about how it needed some more energy if it was to do it\u2018s job!!! That is a terrible story! This was something else about the air mattress, which perhaps you figured out, which I meant to tell you which is don't fill it all the way up. My friend told me that helped. Also, sadly, we both have mean kid stories about our previous, wretched, cancer filled boobs! POOR, POOR US!!!!!! Jsmiley - unless we were all completely anesthetized, it is hard not to notice the aesthetic value of these PS's! Laurie-I hope WE BOTH lose these damn drains soon! BTW, if you want to have a light dinner...don't forget....gummi worms and water! You will feel completely refreshed! Speech - don't forget although you may have to take Raloxifine our docs are just trying as cautious as possible. Sadly a lot of us are young on these boards. Even the VNA said she is used to dealing with cancer patients in their 70's and 80's where tamoxifen is used just to stop it from growing because they are too old to be operated on. I think b/c of all of our ages ours docs are being very cautious. St Cards- that was really nice that your retired co-worker came over to de-weed for you. My landscaper came to mow my brown lawn that did not need mowing and he mowed in the afternoon and it has been 100 degrees almost every day in CT for the past 6 days and NO rain....I see fired in his future! Sorry about the hot flashes....with the weather here these days I can't imagine but seeing as chemo is next for me I will be in early menopause so I will certainly be discussing hot flashes soon! Special healing hugs to all and keep on smiling girls!",

I was also told valium has muscle relaxation properties and this is why it is also beneficial to take, especially during fills. JSmiley: go to lunch, have fun and don't get down.   Do you know we are the luckiest ladies on the planet?  We need to thank our (joy!!) lucky stars that this was found and that we are on the path where we don't have it any longer.   There are so many women leaving us each year and I think it is largely because they just aren't getting themselves checked regularly (due to lack of insurance or interest etc...) and then there are those too old to have the surgery we were able to and strong enough to benefit from.   We have to wake up every day and be thankful our health insurance, our wonderful doctors and ourselves for getting checked and that we are the lucky ones.   Now lamenting the passing of a body part is hard and I understand that but for me, bidding those fat sacks goodbye was not hard!  We now will have fake boobs, albeit a little scarred, no more bras, NO MORE MAMMOS (SUPER BIG YEAH!!!!!!), no more knee warmers and we can near permanently scratch this off the list of things to be worried about!  We have met nice friends through this process on this board and in our travels through the hall of medicine; I personally have witnessed people be more kind than I thought was possible so really, at the end of the day, try desperately to remind yourself we have nothing to be depresssed about and everything to be grateful for. Would life have been better if we did not get this? Sure but at least we got a kind that they are having a lot of success dealing with and curing.   My poor friend at work had cervical cancer (just about the worst b/c of the potential to spread right into the female system) and had just returned to work when I left from her bought.   More to this point, I try to remind myself it could be much, much worse. I hope you all have a good day...I just woke up!!!!!!!!!!   I did a few things yesterday so I knew I was going to be knocked out today!! Liz",

StCards: I feel like it is all my fault for even getting going with the HER2 question.  I am sure what Robin meant was if you have cancer and you have that combination with HER2 being negative, it is easier to treat with ER and PR being positive.  A lot of bc patients found out their HER2 status during biopsy and I was biopsied back in early April but having just found it out, I just had questions as to what it really meant. We all support each other so much, don't let a little misunderstanding come between us.  No one means to be hurtful....we all have so much to deal with every day.   BC does suck but no matter what kind we have, the fact that we are on this board talking about it is so cathartic and it helps us immensely.   We are all having a bit of a tough time of it, overall, as things go so I totally apologize for opening up a can of worms per se.   All different combinations of those 3 all mean different things and all have their positives relative to treatment.  I am just glad the medical community knows what to do for us.

JBL: yes, I am doing my homework and trying to get a plan together for this marathon to take over StLouis...oh...I mean on what tests to take and if I should get radiation!!!!!!!!!!  My initial reaction was emotional but the VNA was here today and she told me radiation is laser accurate now and that I should not be worried about it affecting my heart etc.. and that it will strictly target those pathways that are the natural progression of cancer \"leaking\" out of my sentinel node.   Thanks for letting me know that your recurrence, which I am so sorry you have gotten, was easily managed and small as a result of the measures that you allowed them to take then.  You are all making sense and getting through to me.   Yesterday was just a deluge of information and the preponderance of which I did not want to hear.  It was upsetting but in the end I am sure I will do the tests etc...  They also reassure me that I am moving beyond this.  I know me and if I don't get these tests I will secretly fear I am cultivating cancer in some nook or cranny of my being and it will drive me crazy.   Thanks for your injection of logic, however, much appreciated. I hope everyone has a nice weekend.  I plan to ride my recumbent bike, walk 3 miles and get some sun ...and then sleep, of course!!!!!!!!!!  Is everyone getting passed the post-operative tiredness?  It has been 3.5 weeks for me and I can still do some sleeping.   I don't know why.  I wish I was just doing the 8 or even 10 hours but instead I can take some afternoon naps for another 2-3 hours.   I guess I must need the rest but I am, in a way, getting a little concerned about my love of head-to-pillow!",

      "Content": "Jul 28, 2010 10:42AM - edited Jul 28, 2010 10:44AM by 1WonderWoman Robin: I am just so glad that it now seems that you have a date for the end of August. Of course, and relative to visitors, it would be much nicer nearby your home so I hope the 31st works out. I worked on Wall St for years and was a trader and actually did some direct work on the floor of the exchange. As the only woman, most often, in that sea of very, very handsome men, I decided to treat my life as a museum where I quickly could appreciate the aesthetics of these men, much like a museum, I could not take the painting home with me! I really could have not ever survived if I had allowed personal relationships to develop because as a woman, who fought off advances daily, I was a bit of an enigma for them and they did not want me there. So, back to the falling in love based on looks....never happen!!!!!!!! More to this point, however, I am sorry your potential BS in Edinburgh is not eye candy! Robin, something else I wanted to impart today is something my older brother has always told me: things are going to happen in life and that is guaranteed and the only thing we can control is our response to them...that is it. Good or bad, the only thing we have control over is our response to the event. You seem to manage your responses to the fits-and-starts of all you have been through this summer, just trying to secure a date to take care of yourself, with much aplomb and for this I laude you. I am quite hopeful this is all taken care of by the end of August. Robin, I also know it is hard to be so far away from your \"visitor\" base during such a big surgery but is there a benefit, medical-minds wise, from going to a city-based hospital? I live in Connecticut and, for me, Yale is 1/2 hour away but I would easily do several hours to reach a \"Yale\" if I were not in such close proximity. Do you think you might be able to get better care in Edinburgh? Just tossing it out there...something for you to consider. Misty: thanks for the info on Motrin. This will undoubtedly come in handy when going for the first fill. Reneemac: glad you had a nice walk down memory lane! I can't even imagine seeing people I used to go to school with 35 years ago...or if I would want to! That would be my kindergarten class, however, and there were some racy boys that scared me so I was a kindegarten drop out!  I started in first grade b/c they were pulling up my skirt and one little boy had no front teeth and he was sticking his tongue out of his mouth from where his teeth should have been!  another one wanted to see biological parts that traditionally are covered by clothing!   I wanted to go home and watch Tom and Jerry!!  They were really scaring me!   I think the TE's will always feel a little weird. Good posture, however, what a great byproduct of this whole matter! StCards: I bet it is going to be hard to go back to work and deal with people that cry on a dime about what you are going through. Definitely avoid them. When I go back I will be bald and probably a C down from DD or E I was, depending on bra, before surgery and they can stare all they want! I could care less. I have not sent out updates to people I work with but I work for one of the largest employers in this country and corporate policies are differ so I just did not want to. More importantly, however, is there were 2 young friends, 25ish, getting married around the time I left and I joke with them all the time and I am usually the one to inject jest, as perhaps you all know, into any situation and, for this reason, I didn't want them to be included in knowing, blow-by-blow, how their funny, charismatic pal who seemed full of life a few days ago had something growing inside of her trying to kill her. I just thought it would be too much for them, and a few others, to bear, so I have been quiet. If you go to the Liberator catalogue they do have cami's with those \"puffers\" I often jokingly refer to but what they do is smooth out the weird TE shapes at times and make you look more your original size. It might be something you want to consider. I also have a name and number of a contact there and your insurance covers them nearly 100% in most cases. I got 3 camis and it was $200! They also have built-in drain pouches so you might be able to pass them on to a bc care group in your area after your swap-out surgery is over. Something to consider. Now enough with the small talk, I want to know where you are at on that treadmill progress!!!!!! I notice you have cleverly circumvented that entire topic for a number of days now which, of course, means you are in deep training! I am onto your tricks, missy! I know you will, off-handedly of course, offer up your progress report in a few weeks that will go something like this: I am at 4.2 now and an incline of 7 and I do this for roughly 6 miles a day! I know you are secretly in stealth training mode so you can nonchalantly drop your progress bomb in an \"oh, btw\" fashion! I am onto you!!!!!!!!!! I would like some details now!!!!!!! Also, one final note on the non-driving dog! Did you ever try to let the dog drive?! On Saturday Night Live there was a skit called \"Toonces the Driving Cat\" which unfortunately usually ended up in a fiery car crash when the family decided to let Toonces drive but that is not the point! The point here is this: you are limiting that animal by not at least giving him/her a try! You could have been lounging in the back seat on the way to your fills if you would only give that dog a chance!!!!!!!! Speech: don't wait for those docs.....get hiking as much as you want!!!!! I think, because of all the legal nonsense in this country, they are hesitant to say much so live your life like I do: Ask forgiveness, not permission!!!!!!!!!!! My Day: Goal #1-try to stay awake! Goal#2: finish washing the outside of the house and try not to fall asleep while I am doing it; Goal #3- laundry and try not to fall asleep in the basement! Do you all notice a theme here?!?!?!? I can still put back some sleep! I slept 10.5 hours last night. Finally I will grill chicken cutlets and make my favorite salad, and that which I have almost every night in the summer, of mixed spring lettuce, shredded carrots and peppers from every color of the rainbow followed by a luscious nectarine, the likes of which I have not tasted so good in years! Good times, good stuff! Then there is the newly-acquired narcolepsy to deal with......!!!!!!! Keep smiling...it works! Liz",

I pose this question to everyone.  Do you all think I should take it easy so as to abate the fluid flowing into the drains?  THese drains are a pain in the ass, plain and simple.  It is hard to go out as if you have to hide them and in 100 degree weather, that ain't easy!   I still have 3 in, tomorrow is 2 weeks since surgery, I am seeing both my surgeon and my plastic and I am only pretty sure I am going to be coming home with my 3 drains still in.   Also, I am getting burning on the side where there are 2 drains,right at drain entrance to my body so I have been applying neosporin and finally lightly covered it with gauze.  Upon closer investigation it looks like the stitches are coming undone on that side!!!! Woe is me!!!!!!!  any suggestions are appreciated and needless to say, the obvious is I will discuss it with my docs tomorrow but what I am asking you all today is for personal feedback on your own experiences and if you suspect I am increasing draining with activity...what a conundrum!!!!!!!

Bush re-wrote the Americans With Disabilities Act to explicitly include cancer patients in Sept 2009.  I also feel some legislation/act/healthcare reform should be in place where cancer patients should not even have to deal with generics at all due to the very murkiness of the market as a whole.  We should be automatically getting brand name meds and much like you, and I am sure most of us feel the same way, you don't really mind the higher cost because we are not going to be on these things forever.  I am very concerned as to what they are using for \"fillers\" but that is the combination of the medical industrial complex combined and drug manufacturers being advantageous under the aegis of capitalism.   Punks...we have cancer dammmit! Reneemac: I have been sleeping on my left side for a while and I think I caused the TE on the left to slide more toward my underarm so I tried to correct that this evening by moving onto my right side in hopes to make it slide back.   This is also why I am up at 2AM as it takes time to get adjusted to a new position.  There are a few things that bothered me about what you wrote: First, you should speak to your PS and let them know when you feel comfortable instead of being told you are going back.   You are not even sleeping in your bed or getting a good night's rest so how could you possibly be ready to go back to work?  In addition, I think you need to find comfort in your home...do you have a spare bedroom?  A spare bed?  Even a place where you can blow up an air mattress?  My friend in NYC was unable to get comfortable in her bed after bmx and found an air mattress worked.  I understand your husband might like his side of the bed but you are, after all, recovering from a massive surgery stemming from breast cancer.  The warmest and most sincere {{{hugs}}} to you.   I feel for you.  You don't have to go back to work then back on disability if your exchange seems to only 1 fill away.  I would talk to your PS.  Explain how you feel and what you would like to see happen here and I am sure they will work with you.   Women with bc have it hard enough without additional, man-made complications.  I wish you the best- Liz",

All my life I had big fat sacks everyone calls breasts. I hated wearing a tight shirt b/c it would look like I was arbitrarily trying to attract attention...the arbitrary my part, the attention their's! When I ran with my friend who also had large breasts, we would have to tape them down AND wear a sports bra just to have a comfortable run. So yesterday, before I had to rush off to the PS, I put on a tank top which fit but it wasn't humongous and all I could think was, and I promise you all I have not forgotten for one minute bc has gotten me here, but I am going to like my new, smaller, more athletic, less attention-gathering breasts!!! It was so nice to put on a tank top and feel like I was not going to get extra attention. It felt good ;) Getty...is tamoxifen a form of chemo? thanks for all the wishes on the early departure of the drains! It wasn't the old lady at all but rather all your good wishes!! I guess like they say, watch what you ask your friends to wish for you!!! Ducki: there was a link here talking about healing scars and they all agreed on something you can buy at the local pharmacy and how it worked pretty well. When I find it, I will pass it on. In the interim, Vit E capsules, open them up and put the E directly on the scar. I steam w/lemons and put vit E on my face 1x per week and the effects of E are wonderful and moreso when the pores are open so perhaps after a shower? Certainly might not hurt. Jbl: that HGTV has gotten me thinking so much! I have a room off my kitchen which I don't know what to do with....that was before a month of HGTV! Their solutions are cost-effect and obvious once you are watching regularly. I am also addicted to all the shows where people are looking for new homes and I am also trying to guess which one they pick! The guy that does the basement renovation show where he helps people get their basements ready for renting is so very easy on the eye sometimes I forget what the hell they are doing! He is very distracting. So for that room next to the kitchen, I bought a Poang chair at Ikea and put a few Home Goods items in there and it is starting to take shape thanks to my HGTV watching because I am not too creative by nature, truth be known!! Also, about the drain leakage, isn't that scary? I did not know what to do. 4luvofz: I did not know that about Neosporin either. Thanks for the info. Laurie: showering and swimming?! Great news! Speaking of reaching for your back, yesterday I kind of forgot I had a bmx w/immediate recon exactly 3 weeks ago and went to scratch my upper back and what a pain I got in my neck and it went, quickly, like 5\" down my spine! I guess I woke up some nerves....very uncomfortable business, that nerve-waking up stuff!!! My scars went light as well with the dissolving stitches which looked like monster teeth first view!! Your scars, however, sound like they are coming along quite nicely and congratulations to you on that ;) Jeanne: I hope you are doing well today and the swelling has gone down overnight. Please update and let us know what is going on as soon as you can. You are in my thoughts today, woman! Good day to everyone...keep smiling...it works!!!!!!",

Reneemac-  the MAC is back!!!!!  She has a new breast, has gone off to a day spa and has a high school reunion this weekend....all good stuff!!!!!   You should go to the Liberator catalogue site online and request a catalogue.  There are these puffers (my Dolly Parton puffers!) that you can use for balancing.  There is also a waterproof one that is regulatable (is that a word?!).  The pool situations are always a little hard on your first outing.  It all gets better.  Congrats on getting back to your bed...I am very happy for you.  I slept on my stomach for the past few nights and this makes me very happy!!!!!!! JBL- I do agree that St. Cards is flying along on that treadmill and I am getting fired up!  I walked a mile at a local track today and now I am going to ride my recumbent bike for an hour!   I am only joking and am very proud of what St.Cards has accomplished and I am really doing all this working out just to get an appetite going.  My appetite left the building and I accidently told the VNA today so I will probably be remanded to a hospital tomorrow where they will stuff me in ICU with an IV and a turbin!  It has been nice chatting with your girls........!!!  Seriously...the VNA still has visits i guess b/c of my infection now and they make detailed reports of every visit!  They have been authorized for 9 visits!   I am not excited about this but I play along...!   Sooo JBL..what is going on with you?   Getty- all done with fills and going on a cruise...nice....very nice!!!!!!  Congratulations on both!  There are bathing suits for us mx/bmx women.   You should do an online search.  Or you can just try to look as scary as possible like several others do on cruises!!!! 4luvofZ- so let me figure this out you went away to a hotel (filled with terribly attractive men at your service) on a beach ( like she ever saw it!) alone (being fanned and fed grapes is not alone!) and now you are back and refreshed....I can only imagine!  Well, I have been dodging spooky visitors, trying to keep my boyfriend away ( I like to drink alone!!...joking!), and misdiagnosing myself for all kinds of mets while you have been at a Chippendales Resort (isn't that what they call the hotel you were at?! silly rabbit...tricks are for...you know!)....nice life you have!!!  do you see the contrast?!!!!!  I also have an infection that is putting off my Christmas-in-July treat of chemo!!   My life is grand!!! I need to give you all a laugh AGAIN!   Today this loser was staring at my puffers and he got me so pissed I drove my index fingers into the middle of them!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was hysterical and I think I accidentally sent a message that I was into bondage!  In any case, he was beyond words!!  I just hate the nonsense and, btw, I learned that little trick from Sister Mary Katherine Gallagher in none other than \"Superstar!!!\"   The banana scene...do you all remember that?!  If not, rent it!   Very, very funny movie! Ok...well I have diagnosed myself for leg mets as I have a constant burning, tingling weird pain in both thighs so they released me for weight lifting and I am working out with so much weight I will blow the muscle out before it gives me more pain!!!!!!  he he he!!! Ooooops...a car just pulled up...I have to hit the deck...later girls!",

Marmalade: I sure hope that infection clears up.  Did they clear you for taking stuff like ecchinacea to build-up your immune system?   I hope you get over this quick so that you can move on with this process.  I, too, have an infection and have been on Cipro for a week and although I feel better, I don't think it is gone.  I hope we both get over these as it is holding up my next steps also but the way I look at it is there must be a reason \"our\" next steps are being held up by infection.   I feel my body must need this time for something?!  I can only speculate! Getty: get packing!  I would just love the life...riding my bike to the open-air market, buying a piece of fish and some fruit and vegetables and riding back home on my cruising bicycle!   Laid back life in Italy.  OMG...speaking of which, I think we need more bicycle lanes etc.. in our country but, having said that, I totally forgot Amsterdam is a nearly bicycle-exclusive city.  There is one in this country in Michigan but the point here is more exercise and seeing more of the places we travel on a bicycle is a nicer life.  I wonder how they ride bikes in Michigan in those winters?!? People of all ages ride bikes in Amsterdam.  Somanyblessings: every time someone says \"you will be fine,\" think, say and *feel* 'yes, you are right, I will be fine' as the mental effect of that is wonderful for you.   Don't forget we live in a fairly self-absorbed society where people are leading busy lives largely contingent on their ability to maintain good health.  Cancer scares people and, again, that self-absorbed tendency comes out when they say 'you will be fine' because they are trying to move away from the sickness talk and placate themselves about the manageability of catastrophic health event.  The stronger you appear the less scared they will be.  Don't ever forget cancer scares the ____ out of everyone.   They are not trying to minimize what you are going through; they are just afraid. Kitwe: I am so glad you spoke with him and started a dialogue.   You can remind him the news ones won't go under your arm when you lay down!!!!  Perhaps that will bring him back around!  Keep talking about it though and eventually that will lead to some light-heartedness about the situation and you can move on.  I am so glad you started talking.  It is challenging for us and our men to adjust to this new set! BTW, speaking of new sets, I am so happy with mine even though they are TE's!!!!!!  I was so &^%$# tired of those fat sacks hanging of my chest, there are not enough words.   Had I not gotten bc I don't even know if I would have gotten a reduction because I really did not know I was bothered by them.  I don't even like to wear the puffer inserts that came with the camis so I am not anymore.  I just want small, athletic boobs that don't move!   I guess they say watch what you wish for!!!!!  Thank you bc!!!!!  I know...you all think I am bananas but perhaps I make you laugh?!  Just a little?!.....

I can only tell you there are several, several different types of cancer and they all spread at different speeds etc... but, in the end, cancer is ubiquitous, affecting people all over the world. I was talking with a great mind in medicine years ago at Sloan when my mother went there for what turned out to be a benign tumor. He told me he thinks it is in the water. I have to also admit an ESPN reported, dx'd with an awful strain of very aggressive bc in 2008, died yesterday at 43 yrs old. I have to admit it both scares me and touches me a bit but everyone is different. My father and BIL were dx'd with lung cancer 2 yrs apart, both smokers. My father died 3 years later and my BIL is still alive....who knows? Be happy and hope for the best. I am so sorry you had to deal with that especially at this tumultuous time of possibly switching your BS/PS team. I am going to tell you, changing my BS/PS team in the very last minutes was the best thing I ever did. The best thing I ever did; don't worry...I doubt you will be on the recrimination highway for doing so. I don't care what anyone says-things happen for a reason. Kitwe: I am so glad things are going better with you and your husband. My question for you is how are you feeling healthwise? Speech: back at work....look at you! That is good news and I am glad your work load is less AND you were able to make it through the day without feeling too wiped out. The smallest little things knock me out like yesterday I did a little work in the yard and took my cat to the vet and I took a 3 hour nap....but I am still working out though!!!!!!! I don't miss my daily workouts for anything and I push myself through! Getty: I am glad I entertain you! Just think how entertaining we will be, drunk on wine, riding our bicycles over the Tuscan hills to the market to purchase something to absorb the wine!!!! Good times, sister, good times!!! Speaking of which, I was slightly inebriated when I failed the rental moped test on Block Island in front of my sister who will NEVER let me forget! StCards: HAMSTER!!!!!!! LOL!!! That was good! I am totally off the pain meds for over a week now, sleeping on my stomach again but I put my foobs on a pillow!!!!! A cushion for the royal foobs (expanders)! Sometimes I have a little pinch in the arm on the affected side but overall I am feeling ok. I am sure what you are feeling will get better in time. I think there really needs to be exercise physiologists for bc patients as a fundamental part of the entire process so someone can give us guidance on when and when not to lift, what we can do etc.... There are no definitive answers and I am like a caged bull right now, gazing at my home gym, where I only work my legs, ride my bikes, do yoga, use my stepper and do some homemade step routines. Inside I am screaming 'when can I work my arms and shoulders again' and the reason it is only in my head is there is no one to ask! I hope you get enuf fur back soon to lose the hamster permanently! I am heading into hamster Ville myself! Laurie: It is Christmas in July, sister! She is gone!!!!!!!! Whoo hoo!!!!!! This is good news. I still cannot believe she likened your situation to other's with cosmetic knifings! Glad for you she is gone. Lizzy is NOT relaxing! I do 45 minutes on the recumbent, work my legs, walk around my house which comes up to about ½ mile I guess but I try to increase it daily and I do some yoga, ab work and homemade step routines but I mix it all up. Much like you, however, my energy does dip but I also think that is the lack of appetite etc... First I have to get the sleep back under control, b/c I seem to like 3AM - 11 AM, and then I will get working on the appetite and I am going to make a plan B for days where I just have no appetite. I can't answer your question about fills until Aug 6 but I do plan to drive myself but I am sure you all already knew that! Update on me: infection is cleared, first fill next Friday, then I have to get going on the chemo which I wish I could do a \"Bewitched\" to get by it! Speaking of which, I just found \"Bewitched\" on TV Land! I loved that when I was young!   I am still, however, tired.  My energy levels are lost in space.   I do get really \"crash\" tired at times.   Strangest thing I have ever been through. Robin: a reminder...when I looked into the empathetic eyes of my very handsome PS today, I knew I made the right choice by switching my BS/PS in the 9th inning. I am in very good hands so don't worry about the switch...it could be the best thing you ever do. Keep smiling...it works! Liz",

Jan:  on the pec muscles, because I have done so much weight lifting, I can actually make my te's do the pec dance all those Jersey Shore boys can do!!!!!!  It is so funny!   I love doing the pec dance...now that I can!!!!!!!  It is sooo cool! DOG STORY! I was about 7 and we had a German Shepherd.   He had a run in the back of our yard and my friends and I would try to make it across his circle from the woods without him eating us!   He was good to me but he was also smart and knew there was a group of cackling kids in the woods staging our enthralling run across his circle and he would run toward us barking! I know he was playing.  In any case, I wanted a small dog.  My friend had an older sister who had the clever idea of forging a note from my parents and for all of us to do our usual bike ride to the dog pound to see all the poor locked up dogs.  I scored my little white dog that day with my friend's sister's forgery!  I brought her home by putting her in my basket on my bike!  I kept her in my tree house and I would take her out and I thought I would make her and my R2D2 robot do tricks!  It took my parents like 5 days to realize I had a dog!  Not joking....chasing the dollar etc..!  So I took her in the house also and she was full of fleas and then the house had to be bombed.  My father took me back to the dog pound with my little white dog and told them not to give me any more dogs unless a parent was with me!   He told we had so many animals already and he was sorry but that I should not be scoring dogs in such a nefarious way!  Well, I wanted a white dog so I took our German Shepherd into the first floor of my treehouse and I PAINTED him white!!!!!!!!!!!  I used white paint from the basement and I remember him as when he sat up he was Belgian and he could look right in my eyes!  He was blinking back the white paint and I also painted his nails, his tail, his belly.....I painted the whole dog!!!!!  I then connected him back to the chain on his run and by the time my parents found him he was caramel from the dirt!!!!  I remember my father, calmly hosing him down, explaining to me I could paint the dog the color I wanted and that I would have to appreciate him as he was!  They said I was precocious as a child...I guess \"they\" were right!!!!!!   It was so funny...I remember him sticking his tongue out getting paint on his tongue!   He was so cute...I loved him. It was the 70's so it was the gas crisis and sometimes he would go with us.   He took up the whole back seat and go berserk when the station attendant would come near the window for the money (full service stations back then!) and finally they asked my mother, sheepishly, not to bring him as their attendants were so afraid!   I took him in the pool also!  He was such a pal. May you all have a pain-free, swell-free, aggravation-free July 29th and if this does not happen and my smiling prescription does not work, start drinking! Liz",

      "Content": "Jul 5, 2010 02:37PM - edited Jul 5, 2010 02:38PM by 1WonderWoman thanks everyone...I guess I should just be grateful they hopefully removed the cancer and I can take a shower and stop complaining about the drains!!!!!!   They did take 18 nodes on the side where the draining is super high so perhaps there is a connection. If you have to take the pain meds, take them.   I will tell you all one reason I am off of them:  naturally we are all in the generics with our med plans and when I left the hospital they gave me oxycodone 5-500 which was just fine with me.   They worked well and I was ok.   When I went back to my PS I asked for another prescription and they gave it to me but this time I got 7-750 (?) so I looked it up and those are stronger ones.   Well, I went to CVS to fill the prescription and when I got home, was in pain and took 1/2 a pill and I promise you it felt like I took NOTHING.  I then took the other 1/2 and still nothing.   I waited 18 hours to see if that pill would  start to kill my pain and it never did.  I called a friend who has been pain meds on and off for a while and I know nothing about them so she told what happens is there is a reason why generics are cheaper.   Apparently there are several different companies in the generic manufacturing arena and some are more advantageous than others so they either cut way back on the narcotic or make a batch here and there that are basically blanks all so they could make some coveted MONEY.  It was not until the beginning of the long holiday weekend I realized these pills were bad b/c I had a few left from the old rx.   So I had no docs to call, no pain meds, and no options this entire holiday weekend.   This is why I am off the pain meds and I wake up in such dreadful pain between the te's and their discomfort overnight and the burning at the tube insertion points, don't get me wrong when I explain I am off the meds b/c if CVS was not selling bum generics, I would be comfortable this weekend.   Instead they, I am sure, are in on the money game of issuing \"blanks\" so I hope they are all happy they made a few bucks on a person with breast cancer!  Capitalism....ain't it great?! So StCards, even though I think the Yankees rule, we would definitely both still be on the same pain meds team if I had any!!!!!!!!!!",

MRDRN-I agree that we have to check and recheck but what friend told me is you have no recourse to go back to the pharmacy with a prescription that you feel is a \"bum\" pain med as they will not tolerate any concerns after you have left the building with the bottle.   I guess tonight I will have to sit there and take a pill and sit for 2 hours!   Jerk asses....I bet they know what companies are super cheezy on the generics front and who are not.  I told my doc what happened and I have not had a pain med in 22 years since I had knee surgery so if that bum pill was not working for me then it was definitely a batch where the generic manufacturer did not put any narcotic in it.   Capitalism...ain't it grand?! Well I hope everyone is doing well.   It was 99 degrees in Connecticut today...yuck!   I do have to go to CVS once again and see if they give me real pills this time and that will be my last trip out today because it is gross out there. I hope you all are feeling better and better every day.   Don't forget the reason we have all gone through this and that was to say goodbye to cancer and save our lives so all the little problems are just that: little.  We are all more alive today than we were just a few days ago before surgery and hallelujah for that :) Liz",

Speech- I learned my lesson today about how activity will just keep those drains filling up...perhaps I will get the Darwin Award this year?!?!?! I personally think we should softly, when appropriate, encourage women who are not covered for mammos before 40 to pay out of pocket to get them done.  I know mine showed on my 38 year old mammo but as a shadow.  I just really think we need earlier detection even if it is out of pocket.  I really owe my life to my GP who encouraged me, because I did not want to get the mammo at 40 b/c I don't want radiation exposure (how laughable now!) so he had me get an ultrasound which showed the mass then onto to mammo, biopsy and as you all know, the rest is history. But had my GP, of 30 years who I adore, did not push me in the right direction, and now that I know how big this cancer was, this crap was about to have it's way with me.   It is starting to seem as if it was caught just in time.   How scary and how grateful I am. I hope you all have a good night and sweet dreams :)",

Speech: intermittent breast swelling, especially in this heat that is gripping the country, is probably going to continue to be an issue for us right into August.   What I am concerned about is my thermometer says I am running a low grade fever...like around 100.  I don't know if that is the heat but I do take it after I have been in the AC for an hour and it still says 100....maybe the thermometer is broken but I am going to run to my GP to get it checked tomorrow. Laurie: I like that \"I will talk if you do\" deal you put out there for Jeanne!   Nice going!   It is so nice that you are having a dinner with your husband tonight and that he is going to miss you!  That is so sweet!   Meanwhile I am so glad my boyfriend does not live with me!   I was engaged twice and put the brakes on both times!  I just am not convinced it was/is for me.   I am glad, however, that you have what sounds like a true partner.  Swimming!  Have fun!  i went in my friend's pool last week but a family member of her's came over with kids and I noticed they did not get out of the pool for quite a while.....so I did!!!!  Jeanne: don't you hate the packaging for those \"key case\" electronics from the box stores?!  You need a chainsaw to get them open and I can't even open my kitchen window right now!   Glad you found a body pillow. Do any of you know how frequently a PS will do fills?  I am kind of concerned with that chemo starting and now I got to get the cat's claws clipped so she does not inadvertently do me damage and I also have to get my teeth cleaned and I think I have somet work that needs to be done on one of my rear teeth.  In addition, I have 3 fills to get done and I am hopeful I can get it all done before chemo because after chemo starts I am not even convinced I am going to want to leave the house...except to go to more chemo!  Oh btw....I found something worse than what I think chemo is going to be....my friend came to visit with her kids today!!!!!!   They were screaming and broke a vase and running after my cat trying to kill her and then I let them go in the backyard and they near demolished my rose bush and broke my sprinkler so just as I was about to put my head in the oven, she announced they were leaving!!!!!   Oh...so soon?!....ugh!",

Kitwe: You have to open a dialogue with your husband ASAP.  You have to tell him how you feel and, of course, he is going to say \"no,nothing is wrong.\"  If he is the type you can push for an answer and he will give, then push on.  If, however, he is the type that won't talk, then you start acting out of character.   This is either going to cause him to talk to you OR he is going to ask you what is wrong.  At which point, of course, you will say nothing.   Keep on with this pattern UNTIL he talks.  The hardest feelings come from non-communication and you will start acting differently anyway so you may as well assume the position as part of your M.O. rather than sit and feel pain and hurt over this.   We all know how to make our men talk....all is fair in love and war.   You have to get him to open up.  There is no guarantee you are going to like what he says so then you have to remind him that you hope he was not mistaken but that was not BOOBS standing at the alter marrying him but rather he married a woman.   Plus, and if you did a bmx or not or whatever you did, the new ones DON'T move and scars don't show in the dark!!!!!!!  That last part was for humor. To all: my goal is to always try to make you all smile.  I am usually writing in jest but, to be quite frank, I find a lot of things very funny!  It is just the way my mind works so I hope you all enjoy my tales! Now I have the very, very dubious task of GIVING UP my Maroon 5 tickets for next weekend = SUPER SAD!!!!!!!  But between this infection and the chances that if anything was to happen and I was hurt in one way or another, that could set the chemo schedule way back.   Now is not the time for concerts which also means I will skip Oz Fest!!!!!!!!   WOE IS ME!!!!!!!!!! Have a good weekend girls and because it is the weekend I will say: keep smiling, it works and if it doesn't, start drinking!!!!!",

Questions: are any other 22nd bmx w/recon having a light cough still from the anesthesia?  Is everyone being good about checking their temps?!  Pointers for July and future bmx w/recon girls: get a thermometer that you can just slip in your ear and get a quick, accurate read (about $15 at most drug stores) and for the drains, get granny house coats!  seriously...those pockets are great for drains but what I have done, and this is a tip I got from someone on these boards, is just keep an ace bandage around my neck and I safety pin the drains to the bandage.  Double up on bandages if you feel more secure but it works like a charm.  It is like having 2 ornaments hanging from a scarf!  well I hope everyone is doing great.  I hope things look up for all of us going forward.

I hope you are happy today and don't worry about anything.   Now I want to bitch!  I am tired of having to pin up these damn drains everytime I just need to run to the store!!!!!!!   One of them is still putting out over 250 cc's a day and the other 2 are putting out less than 80 combined.   Tuesday is 2 weeks since surgery....when will this end????!!!

( could have been the meds!).   I was able to start showering 1 week to the day and I would encourage you to get a long, long piece of ace bandage (like 10 feet) and put it around your neck like a scarf.  Pin your drains to the very long ace bandage (of course marking sure the drains are comfortably pinned for maximum drainage) and then when you take a shower just hang your \"Ace Bandage scarf\" on a wall clip that your DH is going to put up for you this weekend!   This way you can shower and have some slack with the long ace bandage to wash.  Also, if you don't have one (and who doesn't?!) get a long, rope-like scrubber for your back because your back really needs a treat after all the surgery and bed rest!   A lot of women here opt to use nylons for the drains and everyone seems to be happy with that as well. I wish you the best and will be sending good wishes your way on July 16th.  You will be fine.   It is over before you know it. Liz",

Hopefully overnight you will have some reduction in swelling. Gadzooks, girls...we just get surprises every day! Laurie: thank god she/he was authorized to take the drains out!!!!

I am not much for imbibing anyway but this latest batch of news could drive most anyone to something!!! Thank you for your well wishes. Again, I am so happy you are getting back to school! Good for you. Also, thanks for the info on smaller meals and the lack of nausea. I am really starved for some GOOD stories about chemo! Cleijo: Welcome and you make a very good point about the support of our sisters here on bc.org vs. asking friends and family and how, because of their lack of experience (bless them!!!!!), they have questions like why prophylactic removal of the unaffected breast etc... . I had it in the left, started as a 1cm IDC, had a bmx w/immediate recon for the same reasons you got a bmx, and sure enough, post-operatively that 1 cm turned into 2.5 cm of invasive, it got into the sentinel node and apparently was busting out of the sentinel node (so the onc told me today), got into another node AND there was a 3.3 IDC!!!!! I am NOT even BRCA so you had many reasons to go ahead and do your bmx and stick to your guns. It is no one else's life but your's. My post-operative results is basically cancer saying to me \u2018yo, we filled up this hotel...do you have another?!' Sure I do....just move over here to the right!!!!! We are the only ones that know what we go through and there was no way I wanted to have to do those damn mammos and have every shadow investigated...forget it! Welcome to this oasis of support and positive energy! Melissa: your way with words kills me! Poked in the eye with a burnt stick!!!!!! Must be the California sun!!!!!! I just think today was information overload. I really have a lot of thinking to do ....after the chemo talk and radiation talk and then all the talks of all the tests and more biopsies etc... I started to have visions of myself with a turbin on laying in ICU! There was something weird today...I am still sorting through it. Shelley: you are a gift from the gods!!!!! I am so thankful you succinctly summarized what a IIb means: That is the gray area between grim news and lifetime worry. That is kind of what I thought but was not sure/have worried to ask. You have a good attitude about all the related tests to a IIb dx but I just turned 40 years old. My feeling is if they have to do this every year, we fall into the chicken or the egg category. If I have to be exposed to all this radiation and drinks and dyes that you have to deal with for CT scans and MRI's and all the other tests. Additionally, and not that I pay this particular source to much legitimate homage (!), but the late night \"I will sue anyone for anything on your behalf\" are riddled with try to bait people into suing over repercussions from the dyes (I guess?) from MRI's? I don't know as I am normally ½ asleep when these things are on. It is all so much to take in. I just wish I was 65 then at least I could look at all of this as some sort of social event! Today, I am not even joking when I tell you there was me and about 15 people median age 70 in the waiting area. I was asked on more than one occasion if I was there with my grandmother/grandfather etc.. and your heart breaks when you admit that you ARE the patient. They all felt so bad...I am 40 but I look 30 so people say. I still get carded for beer...less and less but it still happens! Thanks so much for your words....I am not having a pity party but I am not too happy. In the end, however, I have the utmost respect and awe for the talent and level of professionalism of my breast surgeon and, as far as I am concerned, whatever she says goes. I just love this woman...I wish she was my oncologist, my radiologist, my physical therapist and my breast surgeon rolled up in one! My PS I like to keep separate as he is highly revered, and therefore recommended, and his staff is all so nice I really enjoy going there. To all: As I considered my wretched fate, I tried to think of ways in which I can keep myself busy and we all talk about walking but the weather is prohibitive. I decided tonight what I am going to add to my recumbent bike riding regimen is walking the perimeter of my property several times with a pedometer and try to start getting in a few miles in a day. You see, the beauty of walking the perimeter of our property, our block, our condo complex etc... is that if we really get tired or the heat just knocks us out, we are never far from home!!!!!! This was my epiphany today!!!! I will promise you one thing: The day I stop working out is the day I am dead!!!!! PS-still mad about radiation talk!!!!!!!!!!!! rats!!!!!!!",

JBL a little trick, and just in case you missed it, using lotion to strip the drains is great.   No burning of your skin or gloves and it is effective.   I only go out b/c like this morning I was out of milk and I just ran to the store where some imbecil saw a piece of the drain line hanging out from under my Yankee shirt and I just said \"breast cancer\" and he just stared at me.   It is better to tell them before they arrive at their own conclusions!!!!! Misty the every 2 hour vital sign check was such a pain!  I know it is good for us but it seemed like there were constantly knocks at my  door!  I was glad to go home. Watching the Macy's fireworks on tv...I used to be THERE watching them but I do, now, prefer my bed and air conditioning to a humid night, shoulder to shoulder, on the river in Manhattan! Liz",

Somanyblessings: I had 2 of 18 nodes and I, too, have to have chemo.   Chemo is very refined and for people like us with only a few nodes, I am not confident we are potentially going to be getting sick as perhaps the strength they might use with us could be not too strong.  I don't know and I am sure I am going to have to have scans as well but every day we are getting closer and closer to being healthy again.  If you work hopefully chemo won't affect you too much and you can get back soon.  No one ever told me letting something get me down was going to make it better so don't let it get you down as it won't help matters.  You will be ok...we are all just trying to work through things day by day.  I know it is hard but remember with every passing day you are getting closer to putting this behind you....YEAH!!!!!!

      "Content": "Jul 16, 2010 02:39PM - edited Jul 16, 2010 02:42PM by 1WonderWoman StCards: thanks...I am going to check that out in a minute.  I appreciate you taking the time to explain it to me. Skimmingalong: In my late 20's through about 35 I worked in Manhattan and lived there for roughly 1.5 years during that stretch.   I remember going to the clubs and partying until the wee hours but I was a trader.  What I always wanted to do, however, was choreograph.  My parents had other ideas for me and therefore I never saw it as a means of employment but I did enjoy going to some of the adult studios on Broadway in the evenings just to put together routines with some other people my age.  In a parallel universe I wanted to go to Juilliard but in reality I was pathing for law school and learned Japanese and started studying Mandarin Chinese.   Business, in our capitalistic society, seemed the way to go.  I tell you all of this information because when I want to have some fun and cheer myself up, I dance.  I do step aerobics also and like to make up my own routines (taught for a short while) so if you revisit those childhood things that made you happy, do them.  If it is taking a pottery class through adult ed, do it.   Just find some things that take your mind off of this and just remember cancer is not everything; it is just another thing.  It is just another facet of our experience here on this planet that is inconvenient for a year and in the back of our mind for quite a while but think of all the things people do all the time, like unprotected sex for instance, which causes you to think every now and again that in the 80's or 90's on that drunk evening after the bar fest and that one guy how you could have picked up something that will not show itself for years or those that smoked and never know if lung cancer is going to come and get them etc... .   As cancer is our periodic worry for the rest of our lives, it is no better or worse than all of the other periodic worries we all carry with us and surely behavior brought on other people's worries and we all did nothing to get breast cancer but we all have worries.  Every person you walk by has got something healthwise they are worried about or worse they don't get checked and something can be taking over their body.   My brother always likes to say \"things are going to happen in life; that is guaranteed and the only thing we can control is our response to them.\"   That is it.   Like yesterday I had a breakdown over all that info, today I take it in stride and start to comparmentalize as Jeanne said.  Put it in a box and deal with it when you want to.  Take it easy...it will all work out.  Just think of me with all my new senior citizen friends at chemo in a few weeks!!!!!   There was not one person even remotely near my age.....gadzooks!!!!  I love the elderly, though, and have volunteered for years so it should be fun. Have a great weekend, girls.  We are all in this together.  It is a war into which we were drafted.  Let's fight!",

In any case, back to the bc misery!   I have a lot of appts including the dentist to get a check before chemo and all those other tests etc... so I might be sparse this week.  Oh yeah, and I have to get the cat's claws clipped before she inadvertently kills me after chemo starts!!!!!!! I hope you are all feeling great, getting stronger and having some fun for yourselves!   I will post again soon. Keep smiling girls, it works! Liz",

      "Content": "Jul 20, 2010 03:54PM - edited Jul 20, 2010 04:03PM by 1WonderWoman Jeanne- First I want to thank you for coming to chat with us on a day when your spirits are not that high so that we can SUPPORT you because that is what we do :)  The same exact thing happened to me.  First, are your sure it was not DCIS rather than IDC that they found in a second location?  DCIS is quite common and the only thing that makes DCIS IDC is that it is leaking out of the ducts.  Talk to your BS and be sure there has not been a misunderstanding.   On radiation, initially I was told if it looked like it got into my chest wall then radiation was going to be necessary but otherwise it would not be.   My BS definitely told me about the chemo but then when I went to the onc, he brought up radiation.  I think it is the onc's perception of what is best that leads us to the radiation business.   Our experiences have been quite similar and I, too, was recalcitrant.  It seems like once you get bc, for most women beyond a \"0\" stage and certainly for anyone with affected nodes, you can expect: surgery, plastic surgery, chemo, radiation and physical therapy.  My BS defiitely mentioned, while discussing the pathology report with me, that secondary area of DCIS. To All: Something else I will tell you all now but did not want to share with you previously:  I had a lump, seemingly growing, on the cancer afffected \"non breast!\" over the past week or so.  It just kept growing and the potential for local recurrence is always evident.   I was really getting scared but as it turns out, as I found out at the PS today, it was a fluid lump from the drain that was putting out a lot of fluid and that which also had to be pulled prematurely because I broke the fall of the elderly woman.  This left excess fluid behind and I am so grateful it was JUST fluid!!!!!!!   Just so happy it was not \"THAT!\"   So now I am on antibiotics which pushes up the chemo date etc... by about 2 week.   Oh well...all in good time on that one. Jeanne AGAIN!!- a reminder, too, the VNA came to see me a few days ago and I discussed my concerns with the radiation and they said it is laser-accurate now and you need not worry that the process will arbitrarily radiate your heart, lungs, ribs etc.... That was the antiquated radiation and it's SE's that we are all afraid of.  It is so refined and precise now, don't worry.  Also, recently, I spoke to 5 people, just here and there that my friends put me in touch with, and they were all radiated and they were all fine.  Almost made me consider lumpectomy....thank God I did not do that, however!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Gadzooks!!!!!!!  I keep editing because I am forgetting to share with you one more detail:  I also was iron deficient and when I started taking that iron, I felt great!!!!!  It really does give you a boost but I don't generally eat red meat which I guess is why I am low.  Had NO idea how much iron meant to a person's every day functioning. DON'T FORGET EVERYONE: Orchid from Santa Monica is having surgery on Thursday.  Let's all send good wishes her way :) Hope everyone is well- Liz PS- leaving the PS office today there was 3 of us in the elevator, all his patients and we were all talking about how wonderful he is.   In any case, one of us was going bigger, one had a reduction and I am also looking forward to smaller breasts albeit bc not the way I wanted to achieve that look!!!!!  It was one entertaining conversation!!!",

Sheila- I will be sending prayers your way and perhaps you can send prayers my way.   I would like to keep in touch, post-op, so we can share notes and commiserate!!   Perhaps we can help each other through this. I am not really anxious as I am more anxious about having my breasts and their cancer attached to my body any longer.  I am 2 months since dx and I have been getting pain in the affected breast in the past 3 weeks.   This morning, my previously feral, cat jumped on my side to say good morning (!) and she put her paw on my breast where the cancer is.  I know she was abused as I found her petrified, living by the highway.  In any case, I never move to fast because I don't want to scare her.   I gently moved her paw away and she put it right back in that spot like she knew what was there and she had magic healing powers!  In any case, the paw of my little 10 lb cat was painful on that spot.  The anesthesiologist told me they expect me to be nervous as I have not had surgery in 23 years but I am actually looking forward to getting these breasts removed.   I am finally satisfied and content with my decision but now I feel like I have to feign nervousness to satisfy a preconceived notion?!??!   Perhaps I will be nervous that morning but at this point a few more days with these poison breasts is quite enough for me.  For this reason I think I might be a bit more relaxed than is expected.  Oh...who knows?!  I am just looking forward to waking up and finding out about those nodes. I wish you all well and thanks for posting on this thread as there is a lot of good info for those of us just going for surgery. Liz   ",

Here is what I would do:  get a Wonder Bra and order falsies online (unless there is a local vendor) and that will do it all.  In fact, Wonder Bra had one, at one time, that had inserts that could be \"blown up\" for those needed that kind of service, but overall it is a good temporary solution.  I am enjoying the \"athletic\" look and was a double D before. I am enjoying being moderately flat-chested for the first time since I was 11 years old!!!!!!!!  I know girls, I know...I am weird!

The only thing is, and this is a financial consideration, if you were to not have a recurrence but do have difficulty with your pre-bc implants, I am not confident you could get the replacement or \"fix them\" work covered by insurance.  It might be tricky and/or a fight to get it covered, if it could be covered at all.  The law does state your breasts need to look the same, however.  You might be able to get any current implant failure as a result of rads (radiation) covered for that reason. I know it is a lot to go through.  I am heading in for surgery in a few weeks.  I wish you well and hope I was of some assistance although not able to definitevely answer your questions. Liz",

DebJ: something is bothering you about that conversation with your company.  Be careful what they mean by \"extended benefits\" etc.... as sometimes, and there are huge settlements in landmark cases, their \"words\" mean seperation.   George Bush rewrote the American's With Disabilities Act to INCLUDE cancer patients and to lock up loop holes.   That went into effect over 1 year ago but if you don't know about that, companies will definitely try to take advantage of you.  Do you work from home?  Just wondering b/c it certainly easier to get back to work under those circumstances.   With the germs, the changing of the seasons next month and the grotesque lack of fresh air in big, corporate buildings, I would caution anyone trying to get back.   TAC, as my onc explained, the SE's do have an \"accumulated response\" as Sweeney so eloquently pointed out.  My onc told me you get more sick each time.   We are all different, however, but the one thing we all share is a severely depressed immune system during chemo so tread carefully.  Familiarize yourself with ADA and \"ask\" questions like \"what does extended benefits mean?  Am I still considered an employee?\"  etc... make sure to ask. Which brings me to my next point:  Where the hell is all the money being donated to all these cancer causes going?!  I just called a local cancer assistance program to find out if there is anywhere bc patients can get a discount on a treadmill as mine is about on it's way out.   The answer is NO!!!!!!!!   I have not heard anyone, anywhere on this board not to mention my father or BIL get ONE DROP of any assistance from any cancer blah blah blah unit.  You know what she tells me?  We provided a Reiki information session....I interrupted and reminded her a lot of cancer patients don't need REIKI sessions but rather they need you to cut contracts with \"Life Fitness\" so we can get discounted equipment.  People need money, not bs education sessions.  I worked on Wall St so I know the questions to ask so I started pressing for balance sheet details.  She says 80 cents on each dollar goes back to the patient.  I will let you all know what I find out when I see their annual report she is supposed to be sending but if they gave $300K in support last year, this means they raised $360K....I bet she is full of it!!!!  Of course I have not received a copy of the annual report yet.   This would also mean their annual, total salary base is $60K!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am sure that is HER income.   There is such much graft and robbery with all these illnesses.   It makes me sick.  I wonder if they ever feel gross for taking in so much money and doing NOTHING for the patients unless they live in a refrigerator box.   My friend who has 3 kids and was really struggling called some place for assistance on copays when she had cancer and they gave her like $15...not joking!!!!!  She had to fill out like a book-like application as well. Let me know if any of you have received what can be considered \"assistance\" from any of these cancer organizations that raise funds on the backs of our illness. Your Fearless Leader never stops working for you!!!!!!!!!!  ",

Sohard: nice to hear from you but sorry you are still having such troubles with bleeding.  That is an awful lot to be going through.   Perhaps the next one won't have the same effect-one can only hope!   Glad you checked in. As for me...got my CT Scan, Muga and blood draw.   Later in the day when I was waiting to take the CT Scan, drinking that gross berry stuff, my onc's nurse called me to tell me (Yale is amazing!) that my blood that she had just taken 3 hours prior had already been processed and they found my white count high.   This, of course, means the infection in the pooled fluid might not be cleared so they are not 100% sure they are going to proceed with the port insertion!   This, of course, means I will have the PET scan next week and probably be put back on antiobiotics or someone will do an ultrasound guided aspiration to draw the fluid down.  Bottom line is Your FEARLESS Leader (and Scrabblelady definitely) will (probably) not be starting chemo until early September!!!!  Scrabblelady PM'd me to say she was leaving as she won't start until September and I am going to be the last one, as it looks now, to start!!!  It was that in-between joke of a glorified walk-in medical center that wasted nearly a month of my time and this is why I might be so late.  I would really just like to get started and get it over with already!

Pasta is sugar, white bread is sugar...there is so much that turns to sugar in our bodies, it is great to avoid the obvious sources.  That is good health there, woman!  Sweeney: I do have a really good shopping story AND also Lancome had a give-a-way so all was not for naught at Macy's!!  In any case, perhaps you got the idea I am a little independent?!  Well, I have a small yard but normally, if I am not out of work burning money in the medical industrial complex (!), I have landscapers but about 1/2 way through the summer, when I found out chemo was coming, I decided I would mow!   In any case, I had a marginally useful mower but it needed tune up.  This JOKER who is trying to park himself in my life ensured me he could do a tune up on it.  Well, he broke it!  Jerk.  The reason he broke it, of course, is b/c then I would NEED him to mow and he could come and park his ass here for 6 hours on the weekends....forgedaboudit!!  After him doing the yard twice and then NOT TAKING HUGE HINTS about leaving, I went to Sears Hardware to buy a mower.   My shopping story gets really good here!  The new mower would not stay running.  The guy at Sears was so nice and he was talking to me about the maintenance contract (which I never buy!!) and finally I just told him I have bc, need it for about 2 months to the end of the season in CT.  He really felt bad and was so nice.  His eyes were pools of caring.  In any case, when I called about it not staying running , that guy was not there but the other manager said \"fine, bring it back and pick a new one out?!\" I was like ok?!  Sure, I will be right there!  Long/short they just about gave me a $400 mower!   I was STUNNED!   They felt because I was inconvenienced etc.. they would make it worth my while.   The guy that sold me the mower last night, when learning I had bc, offered to mow my lawn for free!  As it turns out, that very caring, nice young man is the store manager and what a nice guy.  The other guys there today were teasing me about going to dinner with him and all I could think was he and I know something you all don't about me!!  Even still, I am 40 but look mid/late 20's and that's what they thought I was.  Alas, what a nice group of people, so helpful and genuine, it all turned out well!  I was amazed!   They made a Sears Hardware shopper out of me!  In the end, I think the guy I saw when I first bought it really hooked me up.  It feels nice to catch a break once in a while!   Very nice...I am writing a letter to Sears about my experience and in a few months I will get my new snowblower there!  I don't like the summer heat and mowing but I love the fresh winter air and have NO problems snowblowing!   I love it!

In any case... Zenith and Kimmie:  I have to chime in here.  I, like both of you, am on STD and like Kimmie, I am at 60%.  I am ok with that but in October I go LTD which means separation from the company.  We pay for a LTD benefit that we cannot use unless we agree to be fired!   Zenith: you are lucky to have LWOP.  I work in a building with 300 people and they all start coming in sick at this time of the year because no one has sick time left.   Also, just like Zenith, if I attempt a reduced schedule or to go back part-time things get more complicated because lack of FMLA time and establishing  ADA time etc... .   I am also afraid becaues my oncologist told me, in no uncertain terms, my SE's/potential for sickness is going to get worse with each tx.  This means, for me, December is when I will be most sick and I have no sick time left, no FMLA and will have to establish ADA time.   All I know is October is it for me and that is very inconvenient.   I want to be relaxed and not stressed about things while I let the chemo do it's work.   Going back to work means stress from work, stress from people coming in sick and stress from all of that!  Stress is just one vicious circle.  Zenith, if I wish I had LWOP!   I really do.   I wanted a LOA and was told no!  I have, however, spoken with 3 other people from the company who all received LOA after STD!  Does this sound subjective?!   My only options are get back or get fired...or so they think!  Clearly I know there is a problem with this! They will, however, pay COBRA for me once I am on LTD but once the LTD gods, who are relentless and dying to get you off of their payroll, decide I am no longer disabled (as soon as they can establish this, they will), there goes the COBRA payments compliments of my company and here comes the $450/month bill for health insurance!!!!! Geez...the choices are just luscious!!!!!!!!!!

I am the youngest and I put up a good fight!   I had several plates in the air for a long time.  Does bc force us to reevaluate our lives?  I wonder!

That is a rough chemo schedule, btw, especially when you are driving home at night in an unfamiliar city. I hope the next time you are home before dark. Rachel: I flipped when I saw $40 per pill!!!!

Lisaattheshore: That is really interesting about giving neulasta the day before chemo because then it is just loading the body up with white cells and, like you said, the chemo kills the abundance as opposed to the existing and therefore never really starts knocking on the bones to wring out some more marrow!!! Interesting. I am getting it the day after but I think I will ask about the day before idea and see what they say. It makes sense. CKPTRY: thank you so much for sharing your dad's story and I am so glad he is there to babysit 13 years later! That was a great story and I am glad he is still with you. I know what they are doing is being thorough so they can help us but the road is long, my friend!!!!! MSKCC is one fine institution, btw!

Good news! michelle1014: Good to hear from you again. Your hair sounds beautiful! I hope you don't lose it after #3. I, too, had a BMX but have had no fills because a drain came out prematurely causing an infection. I had to be treated for that while undergoing all the scans and tests pre-chemo and now chemo is upon me so with my te's, the same size they were on June 22 , is the size they shall remain until February...or so I thought....Not so good news: I think my TE may have ruptured! One of them is smaller than the other and I called the PS to find out what might be going on and after a few minutes of troubleshooting we arrived at a rupture conclusion. Now one will go flat and the other will be puffed until February!? WTF?!!?!?! The \"F\" could stand for fudge!!! Adey: Mohawk? It will not be the first, will it?!??! You will look uber-stylish on your walks with your Franken husband! The only thing I remind you is signing yourself OUT of the hospital might not be so easy after these antics so I do promise I will take the 2 hour flight to visit you! I will miss you posting as I am not sure you will have computer access where you will be going! mommichelle: my nurse told me yesterday any part of the body can feel sore and can bruise easily. I also wondered why you (and many others) are quite partial to Claritin over Zyrtec? Just wondering. I have never had allergies but last year mistakenly started OTC treating myself with Zyrtec! In any case, I have 2 bottles of it left and will probably use that in place of Claritin but I notice most on these boards are using Claritin. Just wondering. Lisaattheshore: I think we should have our own show on CNN call \"Lisa and Liz: Conspiracy Theorists!\" I think it will be a big hit! Of course they are giving you chemo...I mean why wouldn't they? Under the aegis of conspiratorial thinking, I encourage you to keep an eye on that onc because if this person is in on it, the potential for them to be super surreptitious is evident so you must connect the dots and anticipate their trickery way in advance!!!!! Do you see that michelle1014 finally made a post..gone almost a month...another lurker!!!! DebJ: I agree just when you thought the lows had been reached, someone proves your wrong. That is disgusting. I cannot believe someone would raise money on a lie about having cancer so they could get married. It is just so antithetical it is unimaginable. I can't imagine how they think anything good can come of that. The Gotti chick...shameful. Just so gross. When is enough money enough, I wonder? CKPTRY: thanks so much for your well wishes. The anticipation is the worst. The \"hurry up and wait\" thing was getting on my nerves also. Unbelievable. I am just glad, as of Tuesday, one down and 5 to go! I cannot believe I am celebrating such a thing! FINALLY where is Wherria? I hope you are doing well. Please drop in and let us know how you are. Question to everyone: is anyone both working, on a computer all day and experiencing neuropathy? How can one type if they can't feel their fingers? Just wondering. I posed that question yesterday and was told I am the first chemo patient who has a job where they are on a computer all day so I will have to report back to let them know how it goes!!!!!! I am not joking! I wanted to point out what year it was and then I decided better of my smart ass antics! Alright Jokers (this is a term of endearment btw!)....good day to all! Please do one thing nice for yourselves today...just one thing and when you do it remind yourself you are doing one nice thing for yourself today! Your FEARLESS Leader!",

JSW: I think the lymphedema talk is a 'better safe than sorry' thing for most docs but the chances of getting it are not that high.  If shaving is working for you with a razor, do it.  The only reason they warn us is because a cut calls the water bus to the scene and that means we might not be able to properly irrigate to get the water out.  I was too afraid so I won't take any risks!  I am just sooo looking forward to liberating myself of the hospitals and doc offices, I don't want to open the door to any further engagement! Calamtykel: I am so sorry you are having challenges over there, missy!  Our bodies are going through a lot right now including surgeries to get rid of these \"poison\" sacks or to ameliorate the situation with a lumpectomy etc.. so naturally you are going to be aware of these feelings.  They are real and I am glad you share.  The foob area does not bother me at all anymore or the port area.  Hopefully you will feel more comfortable soon..  Who was it that was told the emla cream could not be used at each infusion?  I was told it can definitely be used each time and it can be painful if you don't.  I can't remember who said it but I would call the doctor for an rx and self-administer before going to the clinic. Rachel: good to hear from you!  My brother played hockey and I can only imagine the wig provides a modicum of warmth at the very least!  I will never forget those 5AM practices and how very cold the ice pavillion was.  Perhaps I would have liked a child wig back then!  When the time comes, I am going to buzz my hair off and give it to the kids in the Yale Children's Hospital who have alopecia for any one of a multitude of reasons.   They have a program there so I will gladly donate.  In fact, because of the cause, I might just buzz it anyway even if it is not going!  Why not let a child have my hair.  After all, I don't really need it!  I am on taxotere ...for just over 24 hours now.  Rachel, just be careful about support groups.  A lot of times they are filled with people who are not supportive but rather with people who want to vent their scary stories.  Our ears and eyes are our windows to the world and information filters.  Just be careful about what you let in these emotionally precarious days.  I wish you well.

Ann97: thank you so much for your kind words.  I appreciate it.  It is just after these past few days it seems interminable to go through this another 5 times.  Thanks for the encouragement...I totally need it.

What still surprises me was how sick I was and did not know it.   I cannot believe that bc was so stealthy, trying to claim my life and I had no clue how sick I could have become.  I have to say this is a scary disease.  It is just plain unnerving.

There is no law that states a cap on COBRA,  The cost of COBRA may be increased if the cost to the group health plan increases.  However, the costs must be fixed in advance of each 12 month premium cycle. ",

Now what I do is compose my response in a word document then I cut-and-paste it into the \"reply\" box here. I am not sure if you know the shortcuts so here goes: highlight and press CTRL + C in the document and then put your cursor in the reply box and press CTRL + V. Those are the shortcuts for cut-and-paste. In any case, I had to tell you, and I hate to admit it but, the hardest part for me is being in the infusion room. There are roughly 20 chairs and 2 private rooms in the infusion center I go to. For my first tx it was packed until early afternoon. Also, because one of the drugs I am on requires it to be thawed, and I guess they won't thaw it in advance because people don't show up, I have to sit there all that extra time. I am like a sponge when it comes to other's emotions and I sit in that room, headphones on, working on my computer but I am painfully aware of the despair surrounding me. It sucks. Next time I am going to go to the hospital cafeteria and wait until they call me after that stuff has thawed because I don't want to sit in that infusion room any longer than I have to. I know that sounds wrong on some level but emotional health is really important and I am overwhelmed by what I feel when I am in that room. The woman next to me was so miserable...I was so glad I asked them BEFORE someone arrived to partially pull my curtain so that I did not breach the privacy of the person next to me. Of course, that was a lie. I already got a sense of what I could expect and decided I wanted to avoid seeing any further sadness as feeling it was enough for me. I know my experience was certainly different from your's but I just absorb other's energy. There was one woman who stood out: she had the most beautiful smile and the most lovely hot pink hat! She was lovely but that was about it. Another thing is a lot of people bring someone with them. The lady next to me brought her mother and some brought spouses or other family members. I did not want anyone with me. Again, I feel their emotional health and/or reaction to the situation would be more than I want to deal with. On a more positive note....my acne is clearing just in time for the next tx!!!!!!! Also, and this makes me very happy, MTV is actually playing music videos again!!!!! At this hour of the morning, like 5A-8A EST, I am actually able to watch the videos that these artists are winning VMAs for! Speaking of which, the lead singer of Green Day, thankfully, pointed out during the VMAs that MTV is giving out awards for videos it no longer airs! Sure enough, there are videos being aired once again. I grew up on MTV and am glad to see traces of what is once was again. Good day girls!",

I just have never gotten it. Thanks for the info. Texas: I wish you the very best on your scans and I hope your mets are responding. I know it is grueling to wait to get the scans (been there!) but focus on receiving positive results. I wish you the best. Wherria: get the 2 additional if you can. My feeling is the more the better in this one shot in hopes there will be NO MORE trips to the chemo factory! Be sure to let us know what happens but if you finish tomorrow, good times, sister!!!! I will update the list with your tx for tomorrow also. I will be reporting live from chemo and perhaps you should do the same! Wherria-I go to Yale and we are both a llb so I wonder why I am able *eligible* for 6 and you would not be. I am only pretty sure Yale is following guidelines also. Let me know what happens. Ladyinbama: I will agree the timing was not great and I completely understand your frustration. It is certainly warranted. On the plus side, he is still by your side and you can lose the weight and your body will come back and be yours and just think about all that making up to him for being the greatest husband ever that lies ahead (WINK WINK!!). Be good to yourself today and focus on how good you will be to him in the future. Just relax and take it one day at a time. I hope you enjoyed your walk and thanks for the prayers because god knows we need em! I am on self-induced, steroid-caused house arrest today! Something weird happened last night. I got out of bed to go to the bathroom and I sort of stumbled and almost fell. I was able to get to my bureau for some stability and it came and went quick but that never happened to me before. It was like I was super weak for 30 seconds. It was weird. I know, it is probably chemo-related but I only had 1 tx and as Tuesday is my next, it is weird that the first would still be affecting me. Weird, weird, weird! I hope you all have a lovely day and be good to yourselves!",

Not full-blown and at least not yet...and not that I know! I just remembered you had the appt and I wanted to know how it went. As for your friend, I am reminded of the famous line from \"A Few Good Men\" where Jack Nicholson delivers the now infamous \"you can't handle the truth.\" I firmly believe, when it comes to cancer and talking about all we are going through, we really have each other as people that are not \"pathing\" with us have no clue. I think it scares a lot of people also and more than they want to admit. As for your friend with the never-ending, over-use of \"why,\" preface every response with what you are going through. Act like she has chemo brain and you have to bring her up to speed each time. Tell her \"well, I am on chemo being treated for bc so I feel ___\" and then when/if she says \"why\" you can now ask \"why I have bc, why I am on chemo, why I don't feel well....which *why*?!\" Girl interrupted, my friend!!!! I do hope you get to the marathon today. Don't stay too long if the weather is icky, however. Speaking of last nerves, I never knew my nerve-satchel had just one left until the other night, in Macy's, a 70ish woman, drenched in fragrance with her plastic boobs on full display (for who I don't know?!) got way too close to me and I was getting bananas. She did not mean anything by it but I don't like people getting too close anyway. Finally I asked her if she could step back and she was offended. Too bad! I have to get everything I need before I go to chemo so I don't have to even go out for a week. Ginger: I think it was the sentinel node and I cannot believe they had NO anesthesia. On the port, I have lidocaine they prescribed and I apply it 1 hour before I go to chemo so I never feel anything. It really helps a lot. I am happy the port is in because I really did not want them accessing my veins from my arm especially with pain, complications and the potential for spills. I was numbed but not twilighted during the insertion. It was a comfortable process. I can't complain. JSW: I am so dense these days!!!!! A lot of the reason my sleep is interrupted, aside from those yummy steroids (!), is the constant drinking of Gatorade and water! I am up all night in and out of the bathroom because I want to stay very hydrated. Does anyone else drink Gatorade? I am still with you on the Boost also. I have one with my pills each morning and I think it is a huge benefit toward getting stuff in me and added protein. I am glad your nausea is more controlled. Thankfully, and so far, nausea has not been an issue but I do have others! My nurse told me they give me 3 meds to shut down all avenues of nausea and that is why I am not having that particular SE. Calamtykel: You have just been promoted to resident microbiologist!!!! The molecular structure of wheatgrass is similar to hemoglobin! I love it! I also love sweet potatoes and that sounds like quite a harvest. My neighbors have a robust garden and although I used to help my mom in the garden, I never really developed an interest myself. I might try something next year. Thanks for the beet juice info. I am not a fan but could become if it will help. Good luck with taxol on Monday. It is easier getting them separate? How long do you have to be there for just taxol? Neulasta: there is an advertisement/blurb on the homepage regarding SE and a few key points on neulasta on the homepage for this site. Adey: that is a nice pic. Thanks for sharing. You are going on Monday again, right? Is that your group of nurses at the center or is it a local bc group?

It is natural, I guess, but, and more importantly, taking their tales to heart is detrimental especially from a woman who makes bread out of grass, cleaned her entire lawn this past weekend, home schools 4 kids, helped them get by a cold with love and chicken soup while she was on chemo herself, is positive and fun and is looking for the positive in anything. You see, each day when we get up we can either choose to be positive or negative and it is a choice. I know chemo can get the best of us down but I would, in the end, accept the fact that some people, be it by DNA or choice, are intrinsically a bit more negative than others and might LOOK for Ses where there are none. I think for someone like you who is not just waiting to find a SE, should you have one, it will be very clear, quite quick OR it will be mild and blend in with other stuff. Don't expect a bad time of it...several of us have been on taxol and taxotere for a while now and we are ok...or so we think!! I forgot about the benadryl pre-tx. I forget a lot of things these days but never did the remote make it back in the fridge! Lisasinglem: it is HOT in San Fran today! I was just watching Headline News and they showed the most beautiful early morning shot of the bay. So beautiful. Nice job on the Giants in the NLDS! I love October baseball. I am slowly emerging from that nasty 8 days following tx.  It feels so good to come out and to know I only have to do this 4 more times and the next one is the 1/2 way point!

Sweeney: I just spoke to my chemo nurse yesterday during bloodwork about the cycle, the sweats, chemopause etc.. .and she said we should get 1 *serious* cycle right in the beginning of chemo and then no more because chemo pushes us into menopause.  We will come back out if it is \"not\" our time but that is what is going on.  Right now I have on a Yankee tshirt, one of my old Bula skiing hats, sweat pants, the windows open and the coolest of sweat forming on my head!!!!!!  I am so tired of sweating!   It was 38 degrees here last night and there I am with my window open, fan on and under 2 comforters!  I think my cat is going to call the ASPCA!

I do think for many of us some very good things will come out of this but, at the same time, they won't be gifts dropping at our feet but rather more awareness of how we spend ourselves.  Not one of us caused ourselves to get bc but now that it has left us in it's wake, it is sort of like cleaning up after those awful storms that plague parts of this country: you pick up and try to build on a more solid foundation so should another storm come, you are better prepared.  Ginger: Perhaps they can reduce the amount you are getting *and* extend the amount of times you are receiving it?  I am sorry for all that you are going through.  I have been on taxotere since September and I am doing ok with it.  Fatigue and muscle pain etc.. and overall it is uncomfortable.  The muscle weakness is the worst when I feel like I might fall. For the first time since I started, I have not worked out or done much of anything since getting my tx.  I spoke with my onc and came to some agreement about taking it a little easier the week of each tx.  I think that helped me.  I hope you feel better soon.  My turnaround is usually day 8 but I am on TAC.  Hopefully your's will be sooner.

No one thinks or really knows I guess. I hate to say it but I have a very short list of visitors for the next 3 months until I get through this. In addition to jokers dropping by with colds (!), I have been trying to do a few things outside but alas my energy tank runs low fast. There are sooo many ancillary benefits to this chemo crap!! In any case, returning to studies has been very good and I feel it is keeping me sharp. I am off to #4 of 6 next week and I can't tell you how I have to push myself into going. The week after is pure drudgery. In any case, CONAN is back! I just watched his first show. I am a huge Conan fan. I also cannot believe Janet Jackson is on George Lopez tonight! She still looks like she did 20 years ago! I think these Conan and Lopez are going to work well back-to-back. I have kept up with reading and it seems like everyone is trucking along. I give us all one, big collective hug for returning, week after week, for chemo and for continuing on no matter how bad we feel after. My last tx is a few days before NYE and I am just glad I will be starting the New Year with chemo behind me. I don't care how sick I will be for NYE and day. Just glad it is over.

Wherria: you have been through the worst of this and you definitely put a smile on it.  I am happy you are nearing completion.   Also, on the italics, what I notice about your post is the font is lighter.  That happens when you inadvertently (very easy) drop into the signature area.  I will illustrate at the end of this post! Lago: I had TAC and my taste buds leave each time and the weird taste lasts for about 10-14 days.  I notice it is getting longer with each tx.   I still have brows and eyelashes.  I never totally lost my hair but I buzzed it because it was long and the stuff that was falling out was knotting up in the hair that was not.   I still have peach fuzz.  I met a woman at \"Look Good, Feel Better\" and she said she lost her brows and lashes around #5.   The fatigue associated with TAC is getting a little worse with each tx but I was also warned about that.   I am on #4 next week as my start date, which was supposed to be August, was pushed to September so feel free to stop by and share experiences! Texas: your hip hurts so you can't type!?  That was hysterical!  I hope you are feeling better. Ckptry: exercise is the best medicine.  Even 3 times a week is going to help your outlook. I can't believe you even have to go through that crap with your son's school and combine that with a battle with bc and the body can only take so much.  You can't effectively deal with all this stress without exercise.  Even Pilates at home is low impact and very good for muscle development.  Good luck today, however, as working with a trainer keeps you going ;) Calamtykel: I am glad you are doing better this time.  I do think the Levaquin had an impact on your first experience.   I hope you continue to feel good.  I hope you all have a good day-",

Adey: why do I feel like my last name should be Gump when you explain how very simple it is for all of us to make (very healthy) cranberry juice at home?!   What a simple and nutritionally powerful idea! ginger: that is so nice that your DD asked you over.  I was just remembering my father being sick with lung cancer and how my stepmother waited on him hand and foot.  Women really are the caretakers.  I have long since lost touch with her but as she gets on in years, I wonder who would be there to take care of her?   In any case, it is very nice your DD is there for you.  My boyfriend has made dinner a few times and brought it to me but I am very, very picky and don't know much about the standards in his kitchen (!) so I did not eat!!!!!! Zenith: I am so glad you are a Conan fan!  It was a long summer without him!   On roids, the one think I hate is the lack of sleep issue.   I hope you get some rest tonight.  You are very lucky your job was so supportive.  I worked in marketing for one of the largest wireless providers in this country and they DID NOTHING and SENT NOTHING the entire time I was out.  My supervisor actually went as far as to have my group sign a card and then he never mailed it.  He claimed he could not obtain my address from HR.  Then after one person called me and I remarked at how a card was not even sent and she said they all signed a card and it was mailed.  I explained it was not received so she asked the supervisor and he told her the address story.   She then gave him my address and STILL he did not send it.  Another month goes by and still no card. Finally that same coworker who discovered he did not send the card yet again asked him for the card and she sent it herself.   When other people in our unit would ask if he was doing something for me he would say no and he would discourage others from doing anything.  There is a special place in hell for people like this.   Consequently I was an exemplary employee who's achievements spoke volumes.   He is just a creep.  Some years back I worked for AT&T and my father died of lung cancer. They sent baskets of flowers, fruit, money, cards  and called to see how I was and that was my father whom none of them even met AND I no longer worked for the company when he died!  I had been gone, working at Lehman Brothers in NYC for over a year when my father passed but they all knew how sick he was.   A tale of 2 telecom companies and how I was treated....it is a matter or decency and respect.  AT&T was better to me when my father died.   Very, very poor management and classless people at this last place.   Disgusting.  I am very, very happy you were treated so well, however!   It makes you feel good.  It makes you feel like what you do is not for naught.  Furthermore, the company in question is always singing and dancing the \"Komen\" and \"Walk for the cure\" song and dance....go figure. Alas I must go snowblower shopping!!!!!!   Have a good day, girls!",

Well, based on what I see on the \"Jersey\" shows, the average age for a mom is 19 (!!!!!!!!!!) so perhaps it is a compliment!? She might not have vision insurance also...certainly a possibility!  In any case, you look pretty young to me. Sptmm: glad Taylor liked the GNC Vanilla. I know it was sunny in Mass yesterday but it is cold up here! 50 degrees a spring day does not make! I hope it is a little warmer on the island today as you traverse the campus grounds. WHERRIA! You are back...good to hear from you. I have thought of you. A nurse at Yale said it best one day \"breast cancer is not the cancer that will make you skinny.\" Unfortunately it helps to pack on some pounds. It also wreaks havoc with our chemicals and, I know you are in menopause, but the rest of us may or may not be in meno, which further adds to weight problems. Sadly I was thinking the other day with the amount of time I am going to need to workout daily to try to manage weight, I am not sure there will be time for meals! A good thing indeed. It is what it is. Don't let it get you down. Is that your new puppy in the photo?! I can't tell but good for you if it is....oh no, are my eyes going now?!?!? Sweeney: before bed, hold your tongue to the top of your mouth until you feel the muscles in your \"chin\" working and keep pressing your tongue to the roof of your mouth. Do this until that muscle that holds the fat under your chin closer to your chin is fatigued and do it each night. FIGHT THE POWER! Effin gravity, menopause, chemo, bc, over-40-weight-issues...FIGHT THE POWER! Tamox headaches: anyone getting them? Well, the way I report most things on this board is after it has happened. So there I was getting those tamox headaches, around late afternoonish each day. I would lay down and hope they would go away and they usually did. This week, however, they seem to abate completely. For this I was happy until last night I woke up with such a wicked pain in my head, in one spot only. It was like someone had a manicotti in my brain and was shorting super balls, through the manicotti, to one spot on my head and it freakin' hurt. Guess where that spot is? The spot where they thought I had mets to the skull. I hate to say it, girls, but if cancer is going to kill you, by the time it does, you are ready to go anyway! I am only joking...don't get nervous!!!! In any case, as soon as I open my mouth about this I know I am going to be remanded to scan country. I still have it this morning but it is not as sharp as it was when it woke me up not once but three times last night. Joint pains: don't even get me started! My elbow is so bad, sometimes I can't even type. I get this pain in my neck which renders that side of my neck just about immobile and I do feel like I am 150 years old with these aches and pains. Alas we are all in the same boat but I am just not that forthcoming about my crummy aches, pains and SEs. This headache, and because it is so focused in one part of my head about the size of a half dollar, is scaring me. It is 51 degrees here and I am still clutching my little heater! I think the weather folks think we should be outside dancing in the streets....50 is NOT warm enough!!! Later, gators!",

I have a quick little cat story that is, in some ways, similar. A number of years ago a friend of mine was getting a divorce and she had moved back to CT and was renting a large house from a friend of her's. As a favor to her, and because I was getting ready to move anyway but was still house hunting, I put my stuff in storage and stayed with her for like 3 months to help her meet the bills as she was also unemployed. The house was large and commutable to Yale so there were a few people she rented to, each for less than 2 months, and what an eclectic mix we were! In any case, there was an Asian man who was pre-doctorate at Yale and another doctor who was studying in Hawaii but was doing something at Yale. It was such a weird experience for me because I had not lived with anyone since my last engagement but it was kind of fun. In any case, the Asian man would bring home these HUGE prawns and leave them, out in the open air, on the window sill. My friend had 6 cats!!!!!!!!!! He actually complained that the freakin' cats were eating his shrimp!! Ya think?! The doctor from Hawaii was fun and we would stay up drinking beers and watching baseball! His fiancé was back in Hawaii so, hot as he was, I had total respect for that! In any case, it was a fun summer but if you don't want cats to chow your toes, don't tie the equivalent of shrimp to them! Omaz: what a crummy year, indeed! Calmtykel: let me know when that lobbying bus leaves because I will definitely be on it! I cannot believe how I thought I had it all together and what a mess I made with my chemo filing! A disaster....in any case I finally got it all together but still a mess. What gets me is all the brokerage stuff BUT because I did not work for 8 months of 2010, I am filing on time because my income was quite low! He he he he! If I actually make it through this year with this negligible income, I might actually be eligible for financial aid for the first time in my life next year!!!!!!!! Well..then again, perhaps not as we still don't know what else the govt cut last night. Perhaps they are going to close universities and the entire country will have to work the land as it were! I don't know about you all, but I have never been eligible for a single dime of any assistance, aid, grants, financial aid for school etc... so I can't even imagine what \"cuts\" they are going to make? Perhaps my hair??!?! Ckptry: speaking of hair, what happened to you when you were helping your daughter was her hands happened to me yesterday. I was sitting waiting for the MRI I would not be having (!) and a woman was outside the radiology area looking at the registry. All I could think was her thick hair was so beautiful and I secretly wonder what will ever become of my new, super androgynous, butch crew do!  As I glanced away from her I caught a glimpse of myself with my Yankees cap on and hardly any hair. I do miss my long hair. When a hairdresser told me it might take 3 years to get back to my original length I was surprised. I am hoping it won't take that long. I have to admit I am kind of \"girlie\" with my hair and I miss having pretty hair! Ok, I am done!!!! Tex: my cancerversary is April 17th, or what I like to refer to as 2 days after D-day! When is your's?  I am so glad it is coupled with tax day, the day I hate the most each year!  Rachel: I bet you are looking forward to going back to work, however. I have been out for over a year now and sometimes I wonder if I will ever be able to work. Do you feel confident you are going to be able to return to work and feel up to the task once again? This tennis elbow feels like someone is sticking a knife in my arm and the PT told me some exercises that don't seem to be helping too much. Sometimes I wake up and can't even move that arm for a few minutes. I don't think I could ever take a job where I was on the computer all day or doing much for that matter...perhaps I will just trade my brokerage account for the rest of my life! If only...in the lovely US of A one HAS to work to have health insurance especially after a dx like bc. I can't even buy insurance in the open market and, sadly, we almost had a govt shut down over budget issues so I think Obamacare got knifed during these negotiations which means healthcare companies can continue to pre-exist people like me. And the beat goes on.... Speaking of the govt, I better get my docs together for the big filing on April 15th. It is a ritual that I do a \"sad\" hour with friends on April 15th! To work off my imbibing, and to celebrate my cancerversary, I am planning to go hiking and will download that old song \"born to be alive\" for my listening pleasure! Enjoy the sun....it is still in the 50's in CT but I will take it!",

I am anxiously awaiting scan results... Tex: That is hysterical that you were getting over on your mom with your Spanish tongue! That is excellent that you have the kids speaking Spanish. Do you and your DH speak Spanish in the home? I think that is really great that you have the kids learning a very much needed second language. That is just great. Isn't that the funniest when people think you don't understand?!  In a related story, I remember being on the 4/5 in NYC and a Japanese couple staring at a map, desperate, and I helped them out in their native tongue. My boyfriend was with me and in Japanese I told them he was an a-hole!!!!! They were giggling that cute little Asian laugh and looking at him!  Meanwhile he was desperate to know what I said but was clearly laughing as well as he knew I was up to something! It was hysterical! I think our socially contentious relations with France turned me off from really focusing on learning it. They hate Americans and are not too nice when we are there. We cannot forget the whole \"Freedom Fries\" ordeal when their ridiculous government sent like 3 soldiers and a backpack to help us in the Iraq war! Could ya spare it?! What I found really interesting was the fact that there is a large Vietnamese population in the Pacific Northwest. I had no idea. Isn't it quaint that we all share our profanities?! I am Irish and Italian and the few words I know in Gaelic are not for church use and the same with Italian! I know more proper Italian simply because most recently I chose to start studying it. That freakin' Andale nonsense is going to haunt me! I wanted to choreograph but my parents thought business was a better, more lucrative pursuit. They were right but there were adult studios in NYC where the classes were all dance just for adults. It was great and I am getting tempted to reach out to one of the old teachers, if I can find her, to find out what the story is with that move! BTW, I looked at about 9 YouTubes and none include that move I am talking about. Adey: thanks so much. I had it at Yale yesterday and I am only pretty sure it has been read and the results rendered. I called my onc's assistant to have the aprn call me with results. That was at 8:55 this morning. The last time they did this was when that PET scan was showing anomalies. In any case, I am cautiously optimistic! Sptmm: my feelings exactly! There is no reason to start getting upset and being morose about cancer, if you can avoid it, because it is here and what's done is done. The only things you can change is your attitude toward what happens; you can't change what has happened, however. I think it is great that you set an example to be lighthearted about this whole matter. You really have to laugh. The worst thing you can do is get wound up about something you have no control over. It is easy to get wound up, however, but for me laughter is the best medicine! Enjoy your mental health day!!!!! I hope the game goes well and the weather holds out. I like the Norwalk Maritime Center. I have not been in a while. Truth be known what I really like are the nature shows in the Imax!!! I hope you and your \"unique\" heart enjoy the aquarium!!! BTW, I have no idea how the heck I forgot MUGA scan! Omaz: Sptmm makes a very good point. You could survive without additional meds but quality of life comes into the picture. Surely you can \"get by\" without celexa but if \"getting by\" was all you wanted, that might be a solution. Enjoy the Celexa! Make some muffins with it! OMG...you are going to laugh your ass off at this one! I lived in a brownstone and had the second and third floors...it was such a great place. There was a 3rd floor deck and I just loved it. In any case, on the first floor was a tenant who liked to smoke pot...LOTS of pot! Finally I asked him to please either stop it, do it in the back yard, open windows etc... because it was wafting right upstairs. One night I come home and the house wreaked of pot again after I asked him to please stop. He told me he had decided to bake with marijuana as a way to avoid me smelling it!!!!!!! OMG...only a super POT HEAD could come up with that! You had to see him when he opened the door! He said \"yeah, I know, it was a bad idea!!!!!\" At least your Celexa muffins won't smell...at least I don't think! Ckptry: When I called this morning to get the test results I asked them to call ASAP so either I could stop worrying or start worrying more! As for bouncing back, not really. My sleep is horrible and my days are a mess because of the lack of sleep. I force myself to workout because I did not like that weight since the dx last year. I have always worked out and just force myself now through the aches and pains. Sadly, and often, I like to nap after I workout. That is totally new. In any case, I started back to workouts about 7 weeks ago and feel better as a result but just wish I had some energy again. Lady: glad you could smile and your stepdaughter was smiling as well! That is wonderful. Gotta keep those kids smiling...it shows they have hope in their hearts! Well, I am listening to Pavarotti trying to relax while I wait for these results. Good day to all-",

All, this is an awful and gross story of CT and capitalism: there was a homeless woman in CT who used someone's address to register her son for school in that town.  She sent him to school in Norwalk and now Norwalk is taking the homeless woman to court to SUE her for what they consider to be her having stole money to the tune of $16000+ from the municipality in *stealing*  education for her son from their town.  I cannot believe how sick this story is.  If I was not sick I would have gone to the rally today.  Now Norwalk is trying to say she is not homeless because they have found out that she stays with a friend sometimes so they now consider her NOT homeless.  I have no idea how this makes her NOT homeless.  ugh...so gross.  So very, very gross.  Even worse they kicked her child out of the school.  This is one of the creepiest things I have heard about in a long time.  Sorry but I had to share!   ",

I know she references Bhama when writing to JSW about her upcoming move but I don't know if that is short for Birmingham. In any case, I hope we hear from her soon as, and I am sure you all are aware of this, several states in the South were hit hard today by tornadoes and Birmingham, in particular, was mentioned.  So Lady, if you are reading, let us know you are ok.   Sptmm: how was the galactogram? I hope there was no pain involved and you are doing ok this evening. Ckptry: I love your dh's name! What a great, I believe Irish, name! On the PTA friend's idea, definitely ask for help a few times a week. I remember being young and some wealthy woman my mother knew used to have a nanny come over just so she could go to the spa and/or sit on her ass! I offer up that story because, in a moderately related way, I encourage you to not always call when the need is severe and don't feel guilty about asking for some help when you need a little \"me\" time. Spoil yourself a little bit with this. You are not taking advantage but rather making your family's life better by being able to recognize your needs before you hit critical mass. I am glad you are doing well. I also agree, NE Springs are nearly non-existent. Texas: where are you these days?  Studying away?!   Miss ya!  Calamtykel: that is awful about the beet juice and water reminding you of adriamyacin. It is amazing how we all did just find our way and got through it all. It does not bother me to go near the infusion room at Yale oddly enough but I don't want to have to go back there either. On the heart test results, you should be encouraged that the numbers are higher than they were 4 years ago. Don't forget, the heart is a muscle and you work your heart through workouts etc... so don't think if there is trouble down the road it would be irreversible. I don't buy that about the heart. I think if you sit on your ass eating fried chicken and ice cream, and even if you are blessed with the metabolic rate to accommodate that sort of diet without gaining 100 lbs, your heart is going to falter at some point, bottom line. As for you, you eat right, take care of yourself and unlike bc, we know for sure heart problems are caused by diet unless genetic. I know it is tough but try to jump off the worry train about this one.  So, in long, if you had a bad diet AND adriamyacin, I could see your concerns and you and I don't know what the people are eating who are driving up the \"adriamyacin can be bad on the heart\" figures.   These healthcare issues are very complex and I don't think everyone who has had chemo eats, or takes care of themselves for that matter, like you do so I say you have a very, very good shot at not having anything to worry about.  I would get retested in September or October, when you are 9mos-1yr post-chemo and place more value on those results. I went to the doc today, only to find out I have bronchitis, and while talking he said \"don't forget you will always be a cancer survivor now.\" It was weird to hear it from one of the people in my repertoire of doctors who I admire so much. It really hit home with me but still, the entire bc experience to me was sort of like a strange alternate existence. I am usually pretty good with words but I can't come up with exactly what I want to say about this experience. It was sort of like a non-event because, in my mind, cancer would be the thing that would break me, the thing I most feared and after going through it, I had it all wrong; it would not break me and the experience annihilated my deepest, darkest fear. Someday perhaps I will revisit a level of eloquence and be able to better explain how I feel about the entire event. Iowa: my prayers are with you. Don't forget, there are cysts and benign tumors(and lipoma as you mentioned...I don't know what that is...will look it up!) and all kinds of stuff that go on in our breast tissue so clearly this could be just another lump or bump. Once Friday is over, you will continue to do good and look forward and not think about it. I am such the eternal optimist with cancer in that I feel they can do so much to help us even though there is no cure. I just know how you must feel as well, however. I would tell you to try to get some sleep but that is probably not going to work so I would take some Nyquil and call it a night! It was funny-the VNA came today and she had 2 nursing students doing clinicals and I told them that, as I took Nyquil last night for the first time in years b/c of this bronchitis, if they did not abuse Nyquil as a teenager, it actually does work! In any case, I wish there was something more I could say but my heart goes out to you. Omaz: where are you tonight? Perhaps lounging in the Olympic pool in your backyard after a nice shiatsu?! Or maybe you took my advice and are whipping up Celexa treats!? I hope you are having a good night. Today I had to have a culture of the wound where my boob used to be because it does not \"smell\" right. I will know in a few days. I am sure it is going to be ok anyway because I am now on antibiotics for bronchitis. Consequently, I have NO clue how I got bronchitis. It just goes to show me that my immune system, 3 months post-chemo, is still not as strong as it could be. Well, girls, I hope you all enjoy my favorite movie tonight = \"The Insides of My Eyelids!!!\"",

The weather here was great today...dreamlike in fact! Deodorant, nail polish, nail polish remover etc.... is anyone else afraid to use these things now?  I am never comfortable putting on deodorant anymore and I also don't want to use nailpolish as all I can think is my nails are porous and that mess is getting into my body.   It is weird.  I know all about the \"healthy\" nail polish options etc... but it is just so weird that although there is no distinct connection between deodorant and bc, I feel where there is smoke there is fire so I don't know if I will ever be all that comfortable with deodorant again.   I am interested in using nail polish again but just can't seem to bring myself to do so.  Anyone else out there with suffering predilections?! Calamtykel: yes, I do feel like bc made less afraid of death and more aware that we are not here forever. That has been helpful to me as I suffered a setback in business in 05 and wound up in corporate America begrudgingly. I seemed to be afraid to step back out on my own but hiding in corporate confines is not my gig at all and I was miserable. Bc was a knock on the door reminding me that I am not going to be here forever and I should not waste time being miserable and that I need to be true to myself. In that way it has been good. Have a good time garage sale-ing tomorrow! Sptmm: glad the galactogram went well. It did sound like it was going to be painful and now I am glad it is over for you. If any of you have any interest, you should order your medical records in their entirety. I ordered my medical records from Yale and you would not believe the crap I have found in there. For instance, the first onc (moron) wanted to give me TCH which, as we all know, with HER2- people that is nothing but antithetical. Low and behold in my med record my current onc notes that the loser onc wanted to give me TC because I was concerned about toxicity related to adriamyacin!!!!! That is such a total lie and joke....I had no clue about any problems with adriamyacin. Furthermore a copy of that report gets sent to the loser, first onc at no request of mine. There were other lies and inconsistencies. It was money well spent, believe me. Hair: it is coming in but now I kind of look like a marine!   Hair grows more in the summer, right?   I am hoping for some nice growth this summer.   A few pieces came out in the shower tonight, which is normal, but of course for me it was reminiscent of the first clumps that I lost.   I hope everyone has a nice weekend-",

Ladyinbama: I sure hope to hear from you soon. I am still kind of worried even though our friend, Charlotte, stopped by to tell us of the electricity incapacitations in the wake of the tornadoes Alabama is having. Please check in soon! I hope you are well. Omaz: what is shaking in the desert today? Are you getting along better on the tamox now that you are taking it differently? Don't forget, there is always those Celexa muffins if not! Ginger: I must be honest when I tell you when we were all card-carrying members of chemoville (!) I was pretty worried about you a few times there. I am so glad as I feel you have come so far since those dark days of chemo and have really put it behind you. I am so glad you went away this weekend and had some fun. Just getting away is healthy also. I am very happy for you and I love that you have enjoyed some outings with your family and your grandbaby brings you so much joy. These things are good for the soul and I am just so happy you are doing well. Sptmm: it does not console but it does, at least, put to rest that the man that killed almost 3000 people in this country, the charismatic leader so many gravitated to, is now gone. I had a meltdown in a cab one night when leaving an event on Wall St and going to my hotel in midtown. I was in a cab and it was not my finest moment. I still have my business cards and memo pads with my name on them from WTC and a total scrapbook but most of what I have are memories and those that I will never forget. One night in particular, I left Lehman about 6:45 (early!) and would have had to wait until 7 to get car service. It was a beautiful, March evening and I just decided I would walk to the 5 and take that to GCT. In any case, the sky was purple and orange and the buildings of WTC and WFC just looked brilliant as I walked across WTC plaza. It is just an evening I will never forget. There is so much about all of my days there and the fun I had and the wonderful spring and summer concerts in WTC plaza and the Wintergarden in WFC. The WIntergarden in WFC was just majestic at Christmas. It is like it was yesterday. Then there was cramming onto the catwalk across Vesey to catch a glimpse of the Yankees on the roll through the canyons! At the very least, I do have memories. When do you find out about your galactogram? Now that I think about it, as busy as you are and as much as you work and run the kids around to their activities, a spaceship would be a proper segue from a traditional vehicle for you! Calamtykel: vindication is a very good word in this case. Surely there are others who can take over but he was the charismatic leader that was able to cultivate such a following, I hope his death has some impact on their abilities to organize in the long term. Short-term, however, they will undoubtedly come together to avenge their leaders death. We are more in harms way now than we were over the past number of years but I am glad he is gone just the same. Can you see any hint of the new buildings over the crest of that hill yet? I believe one of them is up to floor 60 or so. When are you getting your Vitamin D levels tested again? Did you find any good deals at garage sales this weekend? I am always stunned by what I find at these garage and estate sales. Speaking of 9/11, I went to an estate give-away as it were, and the woman was a photographer. She had pics taken from Brooklyn with WTC in the background and a few other photos of WTC plaza and I brought it to their attention and they urged me to take the photos just the same! Unbelievable. I am not inclined to stop at these sales generally but there was a spot in front so I just stopped. It was serendipitous! OMG...a youth group on a scavenger hunt in NYC this weekend?! Geez, you really do like living on the edge! I would not be worried about security as much as I would LOSING one of them! JSW: there are tons that want to do harm to us. Now the protests in Pakistan about our going into their country to \"get\" him basically without warning. I will admit that was bold but, at the same time, you mean to tell me they had NO idea he was living there? They were harboring him as far as I am concerned. Good luck on boosts....this is almost all being put behind you. YAY! Well, a neighbor put a flyer in my mailbox that they have lost their cat so I am going to go cruising the neighborhood to see if I can find little Abby! Good day, all-",

Well, both my parents smoked. It was an interesting point. What about you all? Did anyone grow up in smoking families? Just wondering. A little armchair analysis! Did anyone see \"Brides Maids\" or \"Hangover 2?\"   Good stuff, girls!  JSW: mea culpa!!!!! I though that was the stuff the Jersey Shore meat head advertises that is like a pill to help with fat burning!!!! No, there is nothing wrong with P90X! BTW, I love baby aspirin so why not?! I will put it on my list as well! Sptmm: Deb, did your hotel workout partner, your son (!), make out well at the restaurant this weekend? I bet he did make a little something for himself! Good for him. Tex: a lot of people cross the \"ugly drunk\" line and b/c they are so inebriated, they don't know!!!!!!! Tex, that is a common problem with the no shut-off on the drinking valve. At least you, with the help of some friends, were able to recognize that. My friend John was at a party in Stamford one night and on his way home, as he has the same problem you do, he flipped his Lexus into a bog near his home. He was loaded. He never drinks either but got going at that party and at least he lived to tell. He says his Lexus saved his life. Something saved his life. BTW, on population, CT is 29th w/3.5 and RI is 43rd with just over a million vs the likes of CA w/almost 38 mil and TX w/25 mil. There is something wrong up here that bc is so high in such tiny states. Together we are a little over 1/10th the size of CA. It is in the water here, I am telling you. Ginger: thanks so much. I need all the advice I can get! Omaz: remind me now, post menopausal you go off tamox and onto an AI? I seem to remember that Arimidex is the post-menopausal tamox? Lady: I did not want to use nail polish because my nails are porous and it stinks so I am sure there are carcinogenics in it so I swore it off! I broke down...I had to paint them and they look so pretty! I will take my chances! Rachel: that is some growth!!!!! It actually looks styled and it looks good. It is nice to put baldness behind us! We are supposed to have a beautiful end of the week here and I am soo looking forward to it! Night, all-",

Omaz: thanks for monitoring from vacation land! I am glad you finally got to go on your boat-ride-of-inspiration! Good stuff. Glad you are enjoying yourselves. Dolphins are great, aren't they?! Just love them. Ginger: sure, I will get some pics posted on flickr. It came out pretty good. My sister reminded me it is fairly close to my \"original\" color. She also said I did not burn it and that was good! I am awfully sorry to hear about your daughter. I am glad things went well today. I know about that skin cancer business of a small spot potentially representing cancer 10xs that size. For this reason I had all of my \"beauty marks(!)\" checked out after bc. In any case, I am really glad you encouraged her to go. I guess our hyper vigilance will help our families. Calamtykel: thanks for letting me know about the powder you use. I am not too happy that I spent $50 on a GNC jug, made 2 smoothies and am now being told toss it! Is whey actually soy? This powder that I got is a whey protein powder. I thought whey was ok for us?! You are right, it is all wicked confusing. That is a great powder you are on. I am going to check out their product line tomorrow. As for the cycle, 11 days and spotting, it is a lot to be dealing with. Spotting without a cycle is a caveat but as long as you have been in cycle, hopefully it is about to end for you. I hope you are fine. Don't worry. Texas: I think a person should be able to decide for themselves if they wish to participate in a trial. I think I am going to study the FDA. I want to know about their machinations and what makes that joint tick...besides money! I don't think Stage IV means what it used to. I don't think bc means what it, just a short while ago, did. I think there is a lot of hope for all of us. That is so cool that you met someone from this site for lunch! That is so nice. We really are the Ta-Ta Sisterhood or, in my case, the non as it were! JSW: 2 vacas in a few months! Good for you! I can't wait until this mess is over and I can get back to traveling. I am glad you are enjoying seeing your dh's family. You should go to an O's game while you are there! Best of luck with the showing and I sure hope you get some snaps soon. Lady: Hooray is right! Thank you.  How are you doing these days? Iowa: great tractor! Rachel: boy do I ever sympathize with your worrying. The only thing I want to remind you is cancer does not generally \"hurt.\" I remember a family member referring to cancer as the \"silent killer\" many years ago because it does not hurt and generally does not show signs. This pain in your side could be a number of things although I fully respect why you are worried. I agree that it is hard to figure who to call when things come up....which doc? I am very close to my GP so that is generally where I start. I wish you well. Will be thinking of you and sending some good vibes your way. Back to the \"which doc\" issue. I was feeling the same way a few days ago. The onc, regarding my lump, asked if I saw the bs. I don't really know where to turn so for me it is always my GP. The thought of going to see a surgeon about a lump frightens me quite frankly. Ckptry: Isn't that something that schools are getting closed because of the heat?! Never remember that when I was young either. Four kids six and under is a big distraction! I am sorry poor Aidan has to go for a muscle biopsy. I hope all goes well for him. My 1 year bmx anniversary is coming up on the 22nd. I agree with the fly-by/drag-on ...I think chemo sponsored the drag part. LE sleeve: I sw my onc about it and he said they like us to wear them when flying as a preemptive measure. I am not going to get one until September, when I plan to fly again. Well, good night all and keep smiling!",

I love Great Adventure!!!  LOVE IT!   We have Six Flags New England but it is nothing like Great Adventure!  I hope you have a wonderful time but surely I don't have to wish this as you are going to \"Great Adventure!\"  We are having our own great adventure in CT!  Mountain Lions have been extinct in CT for a while and now all of the sudden they are being spotted.  Where else but Greenwich!!!!  This means some wealthy freak brought them into their home and when they got too big to handle, let them loose.  One was killed on the parkway in Milford, 40 minutes from Greenwich, and they thought that was the one being spotted in Greenwich but, as it turns out, there is more than one!  People just love to push it with these big cats.   When one is eaten by the big cat I am sure other wealthy idiots will stop trying to domesticate them.  I really feel bad for the animals.

In fact, I feed the ground hogs who just had babies and have the entrance to their home carved in the rear of my back yard. I would have felt terribly for that little baby bird. Worst animal story: animals, like human beings, know where the \"good eats\" are so naturally there is a huge deer problem in Fairfield County in CT. One night as I was stuck in gobs of traffic on I95, a doe made it's way out onto the highway, presumably en route the Darien McDonald's, and was hit by a car. It was laying there, not quite dead and the young woman who hit the doe was a mess. She got out of her car in mid-traffic, screaming and crying, dragging the wounded animal to her car where other motorists would help her put the doe in her back seat. She was taking it to the vet. That scene crushed me. I felt so bad for her and the doe. I donate to the Humane Society and to the ASPCA quite regularly. I don' t have a houseful of animals, however. I just have 1 cat. I might get a Pomeranian or a Pug soon. As long as I telecommute to a job and/or go to school, I will get a dog. I have not gotten a dog because they require attention and I have always worked. In my Wall St days I worked 12-14 hours a day. Cats can handle that type of schedule! Ckptry: I was on FB with a personal account but all those high school jokers got on my nerves. Obviously party Jane over here had a very good time in HS but that is long gone! I really have zero interest in catching up with people from 20 years ago. Then I started a business FB and because I still had the personal account, I broke FB rules. I guess you can have only 1 account per human being. If you have a business, you can do personal FB searches....I don't know, it is really convoluted. What I finally did was close both accounts and have not gone back. Friends and family keep talking to me about FB but between trading stocks and architecting my post-bc future, I have several other things to do with my time. I have trouble finding time for Twitter (it becomes all encompassing). In long, if I get back to FB, I will look you up! A lot of people with children really love FB to keep up with news and communications from/with other parents in the school district etc.. I think it is a worthy social network tool but I just have not been able to figure out how I can best use it!",

The fireworks are so pretty at night. If I was up to it I wanted to go to NYC this weekend but I am just not feeling it just yet. Hopefully next year?!?? I almost get nervous putting things off...! Calamtykel: That Bt corn story I know all about it. Do you know what grotesque fast food chain got a hold of some of the Bt corn in the open market and started using it to make their garbage food? Taco Bell. Some govt entity was going after Taco Bell to find out how they got it and how much they used. It is so awful. As for milk, a friend has a dairy farm background and he has always warned me about milk. I also talked to him about the way milk is transported, in those steel tankers, and how there is no lining in the tanker, it is just milk against steel. I think we all should go back to the days, and when I was a child this is how we got our milk, with the local dairy farm delivering bottles of milk to the steel box on the front porch. They would come and pick up the empties and replace it with full bottles. That is scary about the mammary glands. Very scary indeed. As I have said time and time again, our food sources are poisoned. Totally poisoned. Consequently, I am no horticulturalist but have decided next year to plant a garden. I thought of you also because I just saw \"Winter's Bone\" last night and the kids are playing on those hay rolls that you and your daughter are sitting on in your new avatar! Ckptry: I am so very happy that Aidan is out, happy and playing basketball! That is such good news! All those percentages are hog wash. You just keep supporting to fight all these labels and stats and surely he will become the best he can be. I am just so happy the results of his tests showed no hereditary problems and that he does not have the congenital muscle fiber disorder they were looking for. The results seem to tilt in your favor in that the results showed some abnormalities that will help you secure more services. I guess in a lot of ways the outcome of the tests both helped to allay your fears and help you with the schools. Good stuff. On the hand to eye coordination one of my nephews had an \"eye muscle\" situation. Well, after years of those video games, he is f-i-n-e! I am sure, as a nurse, you are aware of this. I guess Xbox and all those other games are good for something! Well, in closing I must tell you all I have grown tired of chasing down nursing programs, trying to figure out pre-requisites and being disgruntled about how even after finishing the pre-reqs, I could still not get in or be wait listed for a nursing program. I have decided off to law school I go!!! That is what I always wanted to do/was supposed to do. I think it is better I am doing in later in life because in my 20's, with my mouth, I would have been in trouble a lot for contempt! In the end it will take me as long to finish law school as it would to get into and through a nursing program and studying law makes me very happy! I am so excited! Very excited! I think I got caught up in the whole medical job thing because of going through this experience the past year but in the end you have to be true to yourself and roll with your talents! My father always told me my biggest problem was below my nose and above my chin! I guess now I am going to put that to work for me!!!!!!! His wife was too cheap to bury him so wherever his remains are, he will be spinning in his urn!!!! I hope everyone has a nice holiday weekend. Enjoy yourselves and remember, every minute is a gift so make the most of each.",

Calamtykel: EBAY IS A NIGHTMARE! I had a weirdo buy a cell phone, not pay for it, ignore my invoices, then on day 4 of the non-pay claims she had family emergency, then she claims she made the payment and didn't. Finally 7 days after the purchase she paid, avoided the UID b/c of Ebay's liberal \"protect the buyer\" policies and it was a disaster. I told her 10 bus days for shipping and she got mad that I did not send it immediately! Then she dinged me on feedback! You know how sellers can't leave negative feedback for buyers? Well, I left positive feedback in caps that says \"BEWARE\" etc..! Screw u, Ebay! Tying the hands of the sellers...it is very seller-unfriendly. BTW, thanks for knocking on my head about Ecrater! Geesh...you told me about that months ago. Also, on that ebay flake, I was getting some emails that had no punctuation, no capitalization and that which I thought was the product of a child. Suddenly the emails were grammatically correct and there were actually sentences. I think either her kid got into her account and bought the phone OR she had multiple personalities. In any case, Ebay does nothing to protect/support the sellers. Sptmm: Ah ha!!!!! So you are fielding offers?! I knew it! I just love playing fantasy \"where's Deb!!!\" Professional fly fishing was competing with the belly dancing troupe! Exercise is great, it makes you feel great and eventually you will have to eat more to keep a healthy weight. In fact, I worked for Bank of the Solar System (B of A!) as a financial consultant (aka get their assets NOW!) and my boss there spoke to this very issue quite succinctly. He asked me if I knew why he worked out so much and he replied \"because I love to eat!\" The benefit of a lot of exercise, if you have a healthy metabolism, is that you can eat more. I just wish I could live on Subway, pizza and sushi but then there is that balance business I have to deal with! Good for you, though. I am so glad you embraced exercise. The belly dancing is fun but I am not at your expert level! I have a ways to go to do an entire dance but it is fun. I do like the music also. Iowasue: great pic! Also new boobs lookin' good, sister! Like I said, about the hair, it is like everyone one of us is going to the same AWFUL hairdresser! My hair is growing evenly, upward and outward! Soon I will epitomize an anachronism and will be remanded to my true place in history= as a dancer on SOUL TRAIN!!!!! I used to love that show! I was entranced as a young child, they all looked so great, grooving on that dance floor....I loved it! I used to throw a fit if I could not watch it. Little did I realize, fast forward 35 years, I am starting to look like an original member! Omaz: not only will belly dancing help the chemo-induced, middle treats (!!!) but it will also get your hips working more for Zumba. You should order a dvd and check it out. Well, the construction at my neighbor's wages on and this is not helping me as I get to bed, post-tossing from hot flashes, about 4 hours before they show up! I am tired and just sold another book on Amazon so off to the post office I go and what I really want to do is go to bed! I am so tired. Good day, girls-",

Now I am trying to figure out how quick, after all these surgeries and crap is done, I can get to Ireland. I notice this is a new trend with me. Anyone else? Calamtykel: meant to tell you, when you sell on Amazon they charge a commission right up front. More to this point, they also give a shipping credit. Bottom line, in most cases if you are selling a book for $10, the most commonly used form of shipment is media mail through the USPS (I am sure you know this!) so you will net roughly $6. Always figure in the shipping because Amazon kills the shipping credit with a commission charge. It is still way more upfront and professional than good old $hitBAY! Kel, btw, the bills and cancer patients need to be seperated.  I really think there should be some protection for cancer patients like these bills can't be turned over to collections for a year or something.  It is so sick and I am really sorry that your credit is being tarnished through this bc dx.  Yale has me crazy; I have a different account number for like 7 different bills all totalling less than $1500 but it is madness to pay them every month and to keep up with it.   I wish there was some extended protection for bc patients.   Send them $5 a month before they turn it over.   As long as you are sending something, there is nothing they can do.   Ckptry: ROFLMAO!!!!!!!!!! Hold her responsible for that and remind her when she wants her first car!!!!!! OMG...poor Carolyn! The hysterical abuse you have to take!!!!!!!!!! I am still laughing! That is just hysterical! Thanks for the laugh today...the really good laugh! Omaz: I bought \"Luscious\" at Amazon. It is a DVD and it is nice to do belly dancing in the home actually! Deb, however, lives in the very metropolitan LI community where everything is 2 minutes away and high quality! For this reason she can easily procure good services and great classes easily. You might be able to find classes near you but getting the dvd from Amazon is a good start. On the baby aspirin, and without asking any advice, I started taking 2 a day. Do you take 2- 3 times per week? How many are you taking? BTW, your doc sounds very thorough. Where do they get the fat from? Is it cadaver tissue? Just wondering. After I got mine out, a month later when I saw the onc the nurse told me I was a \"keloid\" because of the way it was healing (outward protruding). I don't know about being a keloid but I do know that, although I could not feel anything, it was like the APRN had pliers and was pulling the freakin' thing out of my chest! I thought that is why it was healing weird. Who cares?! Everything pales in comparison to bc!!! Sptmm: Again, a great laugh today...ROFLMAO!!! You could not recognize your obliques!!!!!!!!!! That is very funny! Of course, with our post-bc bump spying so good to hear it was because of an achievement that you have these bumps! Good for you! My gym is about to get more luxurious! I am considering buying a sauna!!!!!!! BTW, I am so completely excited that because I won't have implants, I can sauna it up all I want!!!!!! Thank god for Brava. I am also getting a heavy bag and a speed bag. I really want them. I have suddenly decided I want to add boxing to my repertoire! At some point I want to put an addition on my house and I will buy my Arc trainer at that point. I LOVE the Arc Trainers. I am just not going to a gym to use it. About 10-15 years ago there were really good spa-like gyms that were too expensive for jokers and therefore the integrity of the atmosphere was in tact. Now all of these $10 gyms are all over and LA Fitness, with their lap pools on the parking lot at every location, is the only competition. The nearest LA Fitness to me is 20 minutes. I won't rule it out but for now, while I still have all these surgeries etc..., I am going to wait. Very exciting, however, is that I bench pressed last night for the first time since this crappy bc nonsense began and it felt great!!!!!! Well, my Amazon sales keep firing off and now I have to scoot off to the damn post office...ah-gain! I am hoping I don't melt!",

Did you see there is another hurricane tracking as Irene did?  They say we don't have to worry about that one for 10 days...oh, great, that is a relief!  OMG-the beach house I lived in up until about 3 years ago was all but demolished.  Glad I did not have to deal with that!   Did you lose power?  I never lost any power...I really lucked out.   Rachel: scary spinning story!   I was at a Spinning class at Bally's where they had a dedicated room for spinning that was dark and they also turned the lights off.  There was a little light that filtered in from some small windows that ran across the top of the wall.  In any case, there was one guy that was always going bananas and because he was very slender I just figured he was a cyclist that did spinning in cold/inclement weather to keep in shape.  One day he was flailing back and forth while still on the bike and his arms like went in the air and then he stopped flailing and just slumped over the bike.  He had a stroke during the class and could not get himself off the bike because he wore the buckles and cycling shoes to keep his feet locked on the pedals during class.  It was the scariest thing I ever saw in my life.  I will never, ever forget that.   He really worked anaerobically, however, and 90% of the people doing spinning don't do that.  Spinning is an excellent workout and great for getting your cardio more conditioned.  Continue to enjoy and get the ass pad and bring it with you until the soreness goes away.  Problem is if you don't you might convince yourself you don't want to go because of the pain!  Omaz:  What I really loved about spinning is the higher-end gyms normally have a dedicated spin studio where they keep it dark, cool and play loud music while someone guides you through a spin.  The best spin class ever was in CT where the woman was pretty well-traveled and she would talk us through different cities she was familiar with!  It was fun.  I love the fact that the lights are off and the music is loud....I just totally get lost in it.  You might want to tray it and go at your own pace.  All they tell you is move your tension up a 1/2 or full turn and so it really is designed for everyone.   Calamtykel and Ckptry: have not heard from you two.  I hope you are ok.  I saw some pics of central NJ and it did not look good.   Post soon so we know you are both ok.  Hope all is well.

Rachel: those shoes look AWESOME!!!!!!!!   In fact, they kind of look like they could be cycling sneakers!  As for the guy in spinning, it was awful.  It was months before people at the gym started talking about him and discussing his rather slow, and only partial, recovery.   Pushing yourself too much is just not good: if you have to lose weight/that is your goal, you should only ever be working at 60% of your max heart rate except for when doing an intensity workout which for short periods of time during the workout you jack your heart rate to keep your body wondering!  I don't know what his point was.  I am sure it was not to end up as he did. Omaz: I have been on PDAs for over a decade and really love Blackberry.   Thanks for the info on the Galaxy.  I think my next stop is the Droid 3 which I really did not want to go to Droid but I have no choice at this point because there is no way I am going to the Iphone (principle!) and I don't like the new \"curve in disguise!\" Blackberry has come out with recently.   You know, Lancome discontinues colors of lipstick/gloss as does Clinique and everyone else, Bath and Body Works discontinues soaps and body lotions too regularly (I loved Kitchen Spice and they discontinued that and NEVER replaced it!) and my frustration continues right into this cell phone industry!  One thing I can say about Iphone is they just keep making a great idea even better.   These other companies could learn something from them!  I am so completely tired of chasing fragrances, cosmetics and cell phones!  Bath and Body Works was the best when they promised me that they would sell that soap at the semiannual clearance.  Of course I lined up and NO Kitchen Spice!  Perhaps you will be happy to know I am done with this rant, Omaz!!! My concern over not hearing from Kel and Carolyn wages on.  I can only suspect they have had some hurricane damage and are also still out of power.  FEMA was in CT yesterday and one thing the news reported was that FEMA is pledging help but that the entire entity we call FEMA is almost tapped out.  I can't believe the govt might not have funds to give to the states to get through this hurricane damage.  I guess after the terrible winter and the tornadoes that tore up several parts of our country so far this year have run those funds dry.  These are truly unprecedented times we are living in.    I hope you all have a lovely day!  I am really curious about JSW...I know she moved to bama but it has been a long time since we heard from her. I can't help but think about her regularly.  Perhaps one of these days we will get an update! ",

Omaz: I will read that in a few minutes and it seems like there are many news pieces lately about bc and developments lately. I guess it is because we are coming up on October. How is your port removal scar coming along? Mine is still very pronounced. I don't think the nurse knew what she was doing. Someone told me I was a :keloid and that is why it is healing the way it is. That is the *only* scar that looks like that, however! I don't know if this :keloid business affects all scars differently. I failed to ask. As for a cure, a friend of a friend is an MD. I saw them this past weekend. It seems to be generally held that there probably will never be a cure but rather detection will get better and that will help them treat it more effectively. It seems logical in any case.  Who knows?! I hope you all have a good night.  Almost time for \"America's Got Talent\" finale!   BTW, if any of you are Sinatra/Martin fans, you should watch.  There is a guy on this show that sounds JUST like SInatra...he is amazing!

In this post-bc/chemo wasteland our soap box is all we have! I searched Amazon for that documentary and will watch it later. I really think cancer is caused by stress and then there are contributing factors. I lived near Yale University, in the Yale \"ghetto!\" (where houses generally go for $500,000+!!!...some ghetto!) and I was remember there are 3 nuclear warheads (or something to that effect) on the perimeter of the campus on Whitney Ave. Not too many people know that, as they are burried several, several stories underground. In any case, I lived within a mile of that. More to this point, at that time, fate would have it that I started hugging the \"tap water\" and foregoing the bottle (more on this in a minute!). I really think, as subsequent studies on New Haven tap water have uncovered, that is where my cancer began. When my first surgeon found the bc she told me it started about 5 years ago, at that time, and that is when I was living in that area. As for bottled water, this little whippersnapper (!) at the grocery store told me the other day that the bottled water industry is completely WITHOUT regulation! I had no idea and did a little research and, sure enough, she was right. She had to be about college age. She asked why I was buying so much water and I explained it is all I drink and had divorced the tap long ago. She told me how her mom has (a \"C\") and how she has been on the tap for years, and in about the past 5 on Brita. As it turns out, tap water is more regulated than bottled water. Interesting little piece of info. The whippersnapper also remarked I don't look old enough for all this blah blah and I told her first, about you Tex, and second to take a look at me in a year when all this crap will have me looking cryptic! Ckptry: good to hear from you. Healing vibes to the colds and may you get some rest and relaxation for yourself soon! Iowa: looking hot out there in the Midwest! Your husband/trophy (!) looks like Kenny Rogers! Wherria: my sister will never let me forget, and after I played on YZs as a kid, that I failed the moped test on Block Island!!!!! Witch! My inebriation caused the failing of the moped test but that part she leaves out when she tells the story! As for motorcycles, in high school 5 people died on bikes and I have been afraid of them ever since. I do ilke those \"touring\" bikes. Those are kind of cool. In any case, funny story on your first try! As for the enzymes, between the mass they found in my liver, the anal bleeding and my enzymes were off as well when I got the last blood draw, it concerns me but I am the only one it concerns! These oncs are useless after chemo. I even looked up \"oncology\" to make sure the literal translation was not \"study of patient during chemo and dismiss immediately thereafter!\" In any case, it literally translates to \"the study of tumors\" and I guess they feel we don't have tumors anymore so we must not bother them anymore! A close friend has wanted to marry me for years (forgedaboudit!!!!) but I did tell him if I am getting near death, I will marry him so he can collect so I keep a journal of everything I am going through, daily, to pass on to him. Of course he was kind of sad to find out I would only marry him if I was dying! What can I say? I am not the marrying kind! Again, we all become our own advocates in this battle because there is such a huge disconnection after chemo is over, we are pretty much left stranded in the desert. Sweeney: across the board, on this board and others, there are just so many women that speak of the disconnect after chemo and dealing with these oncs. It is alarming but I thought in the US capitalism drove them to act like this. Glad to know socialized medicine breeds the same lack of concern! Shower time! Off to the dermatologist to find out why I have this awful red rash on both forearms that makes me want to scratch my skin off and why my lips have been severely chapped since March!! I am sure she will be happy to know the onc's office said it has NOTHING to do with chemo OR tamox!!!!!!! Effin a-holes!!!!!!! OH...one more thing on manufacturers of tamox: there are 5 but I think 2 are out of commission. In any case, they are as follows: Mckesson, Teva, Mylan, Roxane and Watson. Good day, girls!",

What I find most interesting is how many of us don't want to advertise/have people know we had/have cancer. So many that wear the pink hats, pins etc... never had bc and do it strictly as a show of solidarity with their stricken sisters. I think it is nice that we have an \"awareness\" and I do believe, in some way, it is helping those yet to join us in this fight and for the daughters of those of us already have it. It comforts me a bit to see people showing support. Tex: I have to speak directly to the absolute conundrum with most vegan/vegetarian protein-based options being riddled with phytoestrogens. It is the worst. I even spoke to a dietician about still eating garden burgers and she said it was fine. I still won't eat garden burgers or any soy products as my bc, too, was/is estrogen-driven. So many women do not realize the perils of estrogen itself. It is also a travesty that you had to sit there for a year, with the tumor, not getting treated and continuing on with your diet which was helping it grow. Don't, however, make too much of a ruckus or you might find yourself on Gov. Perry's very lengthy execution list! I am starting to think, with the number of people he has put down, you don't have to do much to get on that list!!!!! Consequently, and to answer one of your earlier questions/comments, I am not anti-Perry. My brother thinks he is the greatest. I just like to make jokes....about everything! Calamtykel: I agree with you there is an \"unspoken\" don't-look-too-hard mentality out there. Surely if they did find a cure, the jobs would be swung from treatment to avoid death to treatment to save lives but clearly it is not seen this way. Like \"Mr. Wonderful\" says on \"Shark Tank,\" it is all about money all of the time! Sinister but true. So how are you feeling now? Lady: thank you so much for commenting and clearing up that awful misconception. I had a bmx and my chances of recurrence are only marginally better than that of those who had lumpectomies etc... Bmx does maximize your chances but does take you anywhere near zero. That is horrifying they even printed that. There is no such thing as \"no chance\" of recurrence. Lady, thanks for doing your part as a member of the eyes and ears of this disease. So many misconceptions. You guys, I am so scared that this poison oak/sumac/ivy dermatitis that has taken over my body goes away before surgery. Yesterday I had to place 9 calls to my dermatologist's answering service to get a call back from the on-call to get me another prescription for clobetasol. I ran out because I am using much more as it spreads and the pharmacy would not refill-something about it being too soon. Apparently there were some jokers working the answering service who never put the page out to the on-call because they are a-holes. In any case, 4 hours later the on-call just got the page and called me. She called in that rx as well as a pill to help me stop feeling so itchy. In any case, she alerted me to the fact that this clobetasol \"thins\" the skin and that could cause a problem going into surgery. Needless to say, I cannot have that going on so I had to cancel all MLB plans this weekend to stay home and nurse myself through this crap. In any case, getting this damn TE out of my chest is so much more important, I had to forego my plans. As it is, Friday's activity really exacerbated and spread this junk. So, I am off to do more loads of laundry and take the first of 2 showers that I must take daily. I am using \"Hibiclens\" to get rid of this junk. I also have to wash my sheets, pillow cases and clothes in the hottest water possible every day so I will do 2 more loads after my shower. It is a LOT of work and no fun getting rid of this junk! Off to calamine land!",

I hope everyone is well I was MIA last night as there has hardly been a more memorable evening in MLB!!!!!!!  It was unbelievable.  I am sorry to say I have 7 televisions in my house (yes, I live alone!) and I had 4 on with games and ESPN going...and, yes, a few pic-in-pic!  It is so sad!  Last night was bananas and I was doing laps around my house from tv to tv! Tex: I got my heart tested right after chemo and it was fine although during survivorship clinic I was told that the heart damage from adriamyacin will undoubtedly show up years down the road.  Another little bit of information I will never forget!  I am really glad your heart tests were good.  Now if only we get some good results from that MRI ;)  Keep us posted on that, Tex. Lady: I am not as well-informed on the Avastin situation as I should be.  I am going to bring myself up to speed on that today.   As for the onc, I don't know what he meant.  I mean aside from the fact they push us out of the onc nest a bit too early, forcing us to deal with our new post-chemo/bc existence with little to no support, I don't take anything away from him professionally.   I think he is very bright and unfortunately, as I said, my memory sucks now worse than before so although I remember the comment, the context could have been germane.   I don't know but I will see him in October and ask.  There is a very good chance he won't remember what was said or why he might have said that. It is just something I am not forgetting.  Perhaps he meant if it comes *right* back?  That is why I thought I would ask you all.  Ckptry: in the event that I heard anyone here speak highly of their onc, I might go shopping, but no one has a lot of good to say so, as my grandmother would say, go with the devil you know!!!!!! Tex: on that dream, that is awful!  I had a biopsy of my thyroid and the needle was like 10\" long!  They went in through the side of my neck!  You know, it is funny now that I mention that thyroid biopsy  because that was in 2005, and at my request, and it just so happens the surgeon that found my bc told me it started around 05 from what they could tell. I wonder if I sensed something?  Who would have thunk it was my knockers!?!?!? Wherria: life, in it's totality, if it were charted, looks like that of a healthy heart monitor.  There are peaks and valleys.  Of course it is our tendency to hold ourselves to the best we ever were (be it in shape, professionally etc...) and secretly castigate ourselves for not being able to maintain that.  If, however, it was meant to be maintained, our monitors would flat line and that just is not life, woman!!!  The lows help us remember the highs and vice versa.   You will run in 2013 provided you are healthy enough to do it.  It is a goal and goals are what keep us alive, keep us living and keep us striving to do more.   A life without goals is a barren existence.  It seems you are very goal-oriented so isn't  it fitting that you have another challenge ahead of you?   I think high-achievers are dished out, and dish themselves, new challenges regularly to keep life interesting! In fact, I think, as Adey just finished a cleanse and is rearing (no pun!) to go, I will sponsor her to train with you for this marathon!!!!  Get your Franken shoes out, Adey! As for the rash, it is just stagnant.  All I know is this crap needs to be gone before pre-op.  Thanks for asking. I think Rachel is a runner but is spinning now to build endurance and give her joints a break.   I used to run but I fall easily into bigger/better/faster/more instead of just being able to run a few miles a day.  I might revisit running in late winter/early spring after the drains are out and surgery is done.  Not sure yet as it is so not good for my aching joints!  Speaking of running, I am so very happy I won't have implants as I have heard more than 1 story of them *shifting* while running etc... I hope everyone has a good day.   I cannot wait for FRIDAY NIGHT BASEBALL!  I also hate to say it, and I know it seems I am the only baseball fan here, but I can't help but think the Yankees waited for the Sox to lose last night and then let the D Rays win!   It is awfully funny that minutes after it was announced the Sox lost Proctor tossed a grapefruit!",

Tex:  WT and you know what the third letter is!!!!   The onc won't refer you?   Geesh, called the orthoknife and ask for a referral!  That will get you nowhere fast.  Wherria: don't put limits on what you type.  If you process quickly and type fast, length is a byproduct.   I am sorry to hear the LE is not going too well.   I am going in for surgery in a few week s and they are cutting near the armpit on both sides.  I read that any disruption of that armpit area is tantamount to developing LE.   I sure hope that does not happen. How are your dogs doing?!  I love animals.  Just yesterday I fed the ground hogs, some squirrels, a stray cat and donated 2 big bags of cat food to the local humane society.  I guess I am a wasp because I like animals more than people!!!!!!!  Just joking, girls! Whitney, I have a devastating story of how Wonder Woman over here decided to try to negotiate the treadmill, by myself, the other night....I am not even going to tell you all what I did!!!!  Consequently you will be that strong again.  Plus, and I hate to say this but, because you put on a few pounds, lifting is going to help you be able, get stronger and look smaller.   Also, because you are not at your thinnest, you will now use lifting as a way to decrease and squeeze the bloating water and crap out of your muscles and tear them down only to build them up stronger.  Bottom line, a lot of women avoid lifting because they don't want to get *big* -huge fallacy- but as you are now on your way back down, it is the perfect solution for you and it will be make your foundation much, much stronger.  I am happy for you.  Also, any questions, the same applies to you and everyone else here, I will happy to answer them. A good, remedial, easy-to-understand guide on exercises for every body part is \"Getting Stronger.\"  That was my bible when I started some 17 years ago. I will chime in with you on the ignorant comments issue.  People just toss out ridiculous statements but I genuinely believe that comes from a place of caring and not knowing what else to say.  I know it can be frustrating but I always consider the source and respect the fact that they are trying their best to say something, if not anything, comforting.  At the same time, it is hard for us to hear over and over and  over again!!!!  Whaaaaaaa! Calamtykel:  I LOVE THE NEW AVATAR!!!!!   So adorable! Sweeney: 26 hours?  Gadzooks!  I guess all you Canadian girls change in phone booths!   One of the reasons I won't go back to Japan, since 9/11, is because of the flight.  Of course, for work, I would have to however. Rachel: he will be sorely missed.  Look up \"Stanford Commencement Speech 2005\" if you have interest in his profundity.   He was a remarkable person. Omaz: I agree that this Sweeney character seems to be leading a bond-esque, globe-trotting life!   Good call!!!!!!! I know you all are on the edge of your seats over the Yankee game tonight!!!!!!!!!!!  WHOO HOOO!!!!!  I can't wait for the pre-game to start!  This is beyond fantastic AND I have been watching between my index and middle fingers at times in case I have to shut the blinds fast!!!!!!!!!! Went to the dentist....a cool $4000 to *fix* my cracked crown and that is WITH good insurance!  They are giving me a fake tooth, man!   Some fake chops!  My ex told me his dentist wanted to make him a tooth from cow bone!!!!!  Gross...gross...you heard me say ex, right?!  That is all I had to hear!   As much as I was beyond attracted to him, to the point where it was hard to keep my hands off of him(!!!), a tooth made from cow bone I was not having!  Consequently that is not why I broke up with him...at least not all of that!  There was something unsettling about being so attracted to someone....very unsettling and control freaks don't like unsettling!!!!   Plus he as outrageously wealthy and thought he was a master of the universe...alas I digress! OK, I am going to Walmart to hear more stories about how \"site to store\" is filled with lies!!!!   I told them yesterday \"Site to Store\" is not filled with lies and computers, as this is not 1977, are more reliable than people so my summation is only people are filled with LIES!  I don't think they liked my math!!!",

This is a little bit of a sad story but, for reasons unknown, a number of my friends are VERY religious and I am a total pagan!!  Seriously, I am loosely Irish Catholic.  In any case, a very good friend in FL told me about a year ago he was dxd with some sort of stomach or pancreatic cancer.  I never heard anymore from him about it.  I failed to ask anymore about it because I figured he would tell me as things unfolded.  Tonight he tells me his stomach was distended and he was in a lot of pain.  I asked how the cancer situation was going and he said he is not going conventional medicine and is praying it will go away....  I told I had to get off the phone.  Either he is BSing or he is nuts.  Please, to all of you who are uber religious, don't take offense at this.  I am just stunned and I don't know what to say to him.  Another friend told me, just before I went for my bmx, and as a result of them not being able to find it on a test or something (I forget) she said \"maybe you are cured...I have been praying for you and maybe it is gone.\"   I reminded her I would be having surgery just the same quite soon!   Finally, a very close friend is a pharmacist therefore she fully embraces modern medicine obviously.  In any case her neighbor, espousing the power of prayer, said his sister in India had AIDS and that God was going to take it away from her through prayer and herbs.  Needless to say, she is dead and only about 3 months after finding out and that is because they adamantly refused any medical assistance. It is a frightening trend.  My *friend* from FL I think is either lying about having cancer so he can tell me when he has the next test that he is cancer-free and that is because god cured him.   I think he is full of *s* about the whole thing and it is another opportunity for him to try to demonstrate to me how if we would get married and I let him show me the way to the promised land, how I, too, could be saved.  This one is a 5 alarm clinger, btw!!!!!  I asked him the other night if he has asked god to send him a woman?!?!  I don't why these guys like me?!  Did I mention I like animals more than people?!

This is a classic \"we have too much money\" Connecticut story!  Yesterday I went to a place that takes donations and gives them out, for free, unlike Goodwill.   I had a few old keyboards, a few mice (!), and 2 old HP monitors that work fine but are just the big, old types.  They have been in my basement for a while and I decided to donate them.   Can you believe they REFUSED the monitors!?   I was like \"lady, this is heavy, where do you want me to put it down\" and she proceeds to say \"oh, I don't know, we really don't take those....we are looking for the flat screens that are easy to store!!!!!!!\"   Mind you, they have a huge warehouse!   I still cannot believe they refused to perfectly working monitors.   I will bring them to Goodwill and they will sell them.   I was so stunned by that! Calamtykel: sorry about your toe!  Geesh, I was thinking last night as I tried to doze off, my nose is hurting so much inside and the blood keeps coming out every time I use my Kleenex, the rash on my arms and abdomen is not really going away and actually seems to come back to life regularly, my lips are wicked chapped for ever now, all my bloodwork, taken together as I did research, can mean kidney problems, I drink about 100 ozs of water per day and my urine is dark yellow (sign of kidney issues again), I dropped my favorite mug and it smashed on my kitchen floor because my hand went numb while I was holding it and my dentist said the nerve in my failed crown tooth is either decaying or infected but I should wait until after surgery to deal with it.   I swear I don't know what to do or where to turn and I am afraid they are going to tell me I can't have surgery because of all of this crap.   In any case, I know how you feel.  It is one thing after another.   I wish you could run today.  The good thing is that broken toes heal pretty quickly.   Oh, Kel, I hope better days are coming.  I am finally going to the ear, nose and throat people next week.  I need someone to check into this perpetual nose pain and my lips.   I can't just, in perpetuity, keep putting Vaseline in my nose to sooth it; I read somewhere if I do that long-term the potential for Vaseline to build up in my lungs and cause some trouble is a byproduct of that.  About home schooling, your kids are totally socialized through church activities.   I know full-well, as I have a good friend in CT that home schools and she can do that because they are very involved with a church and that is where their kids get socialized.   If you belong to a church with a robust following, that is a great way for the kids to be socialized.  My brother has my nephews involved in their church and my nephew is actually aspiring to be a youth minister.   In any case, it is a good atmosphere for them and a lot of my nephews out-of-school activities are with the church and their friends through church. I know it is a lot for me to ask, but would you mind moving to CT?!   I really need you around to knock on my head, someone who never ate beef, who in the past 6 months reintroduced it as I struggle to get enough protein, and you remind me of RBGH!!!!!!!!   You bring so much nutritional value to this thread, I can never thank you enough!   There is a song by \"Company of Thieves\" called \"Oscar Wilde.\"  In the chorus, the lyrics go \"we are our own devils, we are our own devils, yeah, and we make this world, we make this world our hell, we make it our hell.\"   There I go eating beef...I rest my case!!!!!! Tex and ckptry: it is just as well I never had kids because I would so be in trouble!  I don't know how I would handle things as well as you two are.   It is just a travesty that you have to go through it. As for home schooling, I am sure it is hard and kel can do it because she was a teacher.  The structure in schools, if you are not a teacher, is beneficial for sure.  My parents raised us that if someone hits, hit them back!   You don't want that going on but, at the same time, you can't let your kids get pushed around.  I know for Aidan that is certainly not a good idea but it just really irks me that he has to put up with any of that.  May the force be with him! Tex:  I would have been seeing red also.   There was this girl in high school whose boyfriend looked really great from far away but not so good up close.  In any case, our high school was a sprawling, one level school.   The halls were long and, no surprise, my friends and I were waiting outside detention for it to start (!) and she walked in, at the end of this long hallway and with the sun illuminating her boyfriend's body from behind, he looked amazing!  Well, she waited outside detention for me to make threats....REALLY?  I might be a freshman but you are about to learn a lesson!  She told me to stay away from him blah blah and I told her,  of course sarcastically, she had me so scared I was on the next flight out of the country!   She hit me and that was it! When I was done, she was crying and her face was bleeding a bit in 2 places.    I reminded her not ever put her freakin' hands on me again or the next it would be worse!  The next day at school she had her pals taunting me and they wanted to fight me after school.  She had a couple of friends that were huge and I was nervous.  Of course, I had to call my family to ameliorate the situation!   My brother was able to intervene and it all died down.  Oh, so it was ok that you hit me and you caught a beaten for it and now you are going to sick your huge friends on me?!   She never bothered me again!  She would not even look at me!   The 7th grade fight and the Freshman year fight were the only 2 fights I was ever involved with in my life and they were enough to earn me a reputation to be left alone!  I am just not that person to allow anyone to put their hands on me, ever, and I never will be!  In long, it is good that you drove home and calmed down.   In the heat of the moment, who knows what would have happened?  Finally, I am glad you got the kids clothes on Ebay.  It is so important these days to pass on everything you are not using so other's who are having a terrible time, can get what they need in decent condition for a fair price.   Your benevolence is a welcome treat for someone else, woman!   If, however, you were trying to donate those clothes in CT, you might be told they need only designer labels at this point!!! Well, I am going to organize my shed today!   It is beautiful out and I am ready to get that mess straightened out! Good day, girls-",

Has anyone else had their cholesterol tested since chemo?  if so, any changes?  I have eaten \"some\" red meat in the past few months and I always had perfect cholesterol . Sure enough, my cholesterol is a bit above the normal range. I am not eating any more red meat A) because I don't like what they do to manufacture it and B) because of the cholesterol results.  I ate red meat very, very rarely for the past 20 years.   If red meat is to blame for my moderate rise in cholesterol, that is perfectly awful since I really have not eaten much of it.  ",

Yale Cancer had a rally 10 minutes from my house last week and I had no idea until I read the paper the next day as I guess it was organized through FB.  In any case, something in that article about CT bc rates and RI being #1 is because we have more money here, better benefits and we are being diagnosed earlier.   It is such a shame that not having money and/or benefits precludes you from being treated like a human being.   I found that news both heartening and disheartening.   More to this point, however, and to circle back to the invasive nature of our online society, I *hate* FB and think it is a gargantuan waste of time (sorry, all...I know a lot of people love it.)   I find, however, that many of these bc events are organized through FB.  It seems every time I try to get involved with a walk, a charity, a situation where I can help other similarly situated as I was last year at this time all I find are places that want donations.  Some people just need some help.  I think WE should all get together and start a site where those *in need* can post their need and someone can help that person.  I think all the rest of these fundraising organizations don't get to actually help people that need it.  I am sure someone out there going through chemo might need someone to do grocery shopping.  I have ideas, girls...I think we need to take action for our sisters in the fight!

Ckptry: will be sending good vibes, woman.   I hope all is well.  At least they are listening to you and focusing on what is going on with you.    Let us know how it turns out and, yes, it is unbelievable how you are just truckin' along and all of the sudden you are pulled over by the \"cancer scare\" troopers!   It sucks actually. Calamtykel: you are really clever and talented in the kitchen, it seems, and it still amazes me some of the things you can whip up!  In any case, I am not so much!    At Aldi I buy the \"Fit and Active\" chicken broth in the box.  I love making that spinach, tortellini soup and it would cost me $20 for 4 boxes of College Inn and it costs me $9 for the same amount at Aldi!  That, needless to say, is a huge savings.  I also like cream in my coffee (yes, am back to 2 cups per day!).   My sister had their cream and I really liked it.  I bought it and then saw that it has *corn syrup solids* in it but then I saw the Stop and Shop cream has a disclaimer about how cows treated rBGH show no difference than those not treated with it...but what about the humans?!   In any case, now it looks my choice is corn syrup  solids or cancer causing agents with my morning coffee!  I also buy flower etc... to make holiday ornaments.   That is about it.  I don't shop their full dairy case but will definitely be buying milk there forever now. The strangest thing happened in Aldi about a week ago.  There was a young woman and she had her very young son with her.   He had to be a little over a year old I would guess.   I do love kids but just never  wanted them myself-actually I believe in 2 parent households and never felt I could stick with the father long enough to raise kids and that is what put me off!!  Just being honest.  That is not to say I wouldn't become a foster mother at some point for the very unwanted older demographic that are left to rot in these orphanages.  In any case, this young woman's son was so adorable and bonded with me like the second he saw me.  I was not so impressed with the way she was treating him, nor the idea he had no shoes on, but I said nothing and just paid him some attention when, it just so happens, they wound up in front of me in line.  In any case, she waited outside the store and as I left she seemed to want to talk to me and all I could think was this can't be good.   I am NOT joking.  I just smiled politely and kept walking but as I got in my car I got the distinct impression something very weird almost happened.  She stood there and watched me drive away and then I could see her walk to her car while I was waiting to exit the parking lot.   It was so weird and for a second all I could think was she wanted to give him up.   I never felt like that in my life.  It was really weird.  Aldi, however, is a great place! Omaz: how is your friend doing? Is she still back in ICU?  I hope she is alright.   How are you doing these days?  How is your \"sunflower\" hair?!   Hopefully you have graduated to a bush by now! Wherria: good news on the no-liver-mets news!   The dubious things we celebrate these days!!!   I think some day I will just accept this state of affairs I find myself in with being overly concerned about mets and will hopefully take it in stride some day.  I meant to tell you....I put coconut oil in my nose and I am feeling better!!!!!!!  Don't ask me why but the pain is unbearable and I used my nurse friends reco (!) but was just standing in the kitchen and thought I would give it a whirl!   It, too, provides much needed relief.  I am so worried as I have pre-op next week and not only is my nose killing me, I was using that damn Vaseline for about a month which, because it is not water soluble, can end up in your lung cavity and sit there until it causes trouble.  This morning I am coughing and sneezing and my arms still show clear evidence of a terrible rash as does my stomach.  I am PETRIFIED they won't clear me for surgery.   I am starting to wonder if all of this could be stemming from my body rejecting that TE that has been in there, deflated, for 16 months now.   I don't think they were meant to be in our bodies that long.   Who knows?  All I can say is I hope I am much better/get cleared for surgery next week.  I want this TE out and to get these boobs fixed up and get back to my damn life!!!! I wanted to tell you a friend of mine finally got high speed and now she types longer emails etc.... She had been screwing around with those \"pads\" and their mandatory wireless carriers and now is back on her notebook with high speed.   She is very bright also and now sends emails that are composed like she is on a computer!   You see, if you have a good internet connection, type several WPM and are on the bright side, which I deeply suspect you are, length is just a byproduct!  On that note, EXPRESS YOURSELF! Good day to everyone-",

Should you want to develop more muscle, you would increase to more sets and less reps.  For building muscle, the rule of thumb is 4 sets/12 reps.   Actually, if you buy freeweight bars, you can make weights in whatever increments you want.  There are \"1 lb\" plates.   I actually have a few old 1 lbers!   Also, something I did when I was unaware of freeweights is when I wanted to increase my weight but not to the next dumbbell weight, I would use my 1's and 5's together.  If you want to go to 7lbs, use 2's and 5's.   I would check CL for freeweights, however.  They are significantly less expensive to buy used and they are something that totally warrants being bought used as plates, bars and the like \"don't\" go bad!   All they might do is rust a little. When it comes to purchasing workout equipment, I always encourage people to start with something used until you know you are going to use it. BTW, this is the book that I have told you all about: http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Stronger-Weight-Training-Women/dp/0936070048 You can buy it used at Amazon for $1.25 + shipping.  It is an excellent resource for anyone interested in toning or building muscle.  It teaches all the different types of lifting you can do for every body part.  For instance, everyone thinks the end of the road on biceps is free or preacher curls = not so.  There are several exercises for bi's and tri's and don't kid yourself into thinking that you are not \"serious\" about lifting so don't need to know more.  If you are lifting then you are serious and knowledge is power.   It is imperative you study your form and if you squat, you should get a belt and also invest in some gloves.  I have always used gloves with wrist support.  Also, because of chemo, we all need to know more about lifting as our bones need support and protection from the likes of osteoporosis etc...   Lifting combined with yoga, calisthenics and pilates will keep your infrastructure in good shape and keep you flexible.   Cardio trims the fat!",

      "Content": "Nov 8, 2011 07:06AM - edited Nov 8, 2011 07:11AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors- Whew...was I sore this weekend....suddenly my body reminded me I just had a huge surgery and it is time to start acting like it! I was in bed 80% of the day on Sunday. I revisited the PS today and I got one drain out!!!!!! YAY!!!!!! Will all of my 1970s disco queens starting singing along with me that \"These are the good times!!\" Good times indeed! Ginger: those little joker vampires don't scare me!!!!!! Every generation has it's \"thing\" as I am only too confident my parents wished Madonna never happened in the 80's and that my brothers, sister and I did not all have such an ardent interest in drinking and concert-going but the one thing I can say, and relative to these vamp kids, we never wanted to bite human beings and draw blood! It was just so funny to have these kids so interested in my JP drains because of the blood. Consequently, unless I am going to the hospital/dr's appt, I hide them but that night one of them snuck out from under my longish sweater type of coat and that was all those nut jobs had to see! I have since moved on to huge sweat pants to hide the drains! So how are you doing out there in Seattle these days? Have you adjusted to the weather at all? I know Chicago is hardly tropical but, at the same time, you get used to weather and location and I am wondering if you are feeling it yet out there on the West Coast? Are you still going to the sewing class or was it a one-time only deal? Finally, are you enjoying your new sewing machine? I am so completely non-domestic I would not even know where to begin but I can tell you after pricing out energy-efficient curtains, I momentarily considered getting a sewing machine and doing it myself and then I woke up! Of course I went retail on the curtains which probably cost 3 times the amount of a decent sewing machine. I collect old stock certificates and I am sure this is something you might never be interested in! We all have our thing, I guess. Omaz: that book is THE BIBLE to working out. Every body part is broken down into every possible exercise you could ever want to do. It is so well illustrated and it also helps you move with confidence in the free weights area. Consequently, and just so you know, you might pick up on an exercise in that book that you will NEVER see anyone at the gym do. The reason for this is, and just like that disgusting NY Post that every MALE broker I ever worked with on Wall St, handed off to each other to take the the men's room and peruse (it was the grossest, grossest thing I ever saw in my life and by 11 AM was undoubtedly riddled with enough staph to kill a few people!), men will get into a routine and pass information off as if it is all good, to each other, in the old boy's school. That is why you see the same old exercises always being done in most free weight gym areas. Therefore, when you decide to do bi curls by using the incline bench and a 10 lb dumb bell, 1 arm at a time, and they look at you like you are either an innovator or crazy, remember they never read a book like \"Getting Stronger\" but rather either learned their routine through watching others, picking up info in the locker room or from a trainer who probably learned from watching people or picking stuff up in the locker room! On that staph filled NY Post, as soon as they found out it grossed me out so much, they would purposely put it on my desk!   Of course, I was one of the top producers and it was not long before I had my own office and do you know where that post found it's way to?  The floor outside my office door!!!!!  Punks...there were all punks terrorizing me with that perfectly gross NY Post they all shared for those way, way too long bathroom trips every morning!   So now you have what you need to learn to lift and develop every body part. I would encourage you to save yourself a few bucks and skip the trainer....you have everything you need now! Sptmm: how are you feeling these days?  What is shaking on the island, sister?!   BTW, you were talking about museums a few posts ago (!); did you ever get to the Guggenheim?  You should check it out.  Lady: Like I said, I thought they were harmless but I did not want to find out any different so I figured \"urine\" would scare them off! There were 5 of them....the mall is a SCARY place!!! I am so, so, so glad to read your hair is coming back!!! That is great. Prenatal vitamins probably will help and surely they won't harm. I am not joking when I tell you every Saturday morning as a child I had to watch \"American Bandstand\" and \"Soul Train!\" They were on back-to-back and I just loved watching those shows. I remember my mother telling my brothers \"don't bother her, you know she is watching Soul Train!!\" In any case, about another month with this hair regrowth and I will look like one of the original cast members of that dance show I loved so much! It is growing in thicker, and getting higher and wavier....I don't want to do! I had to blow dry it this morning.....I quickly put a hat on! Perhaps 1 year from now I will be in better shape with this hair! I am just so glad to know your's is on its way back in! Lady, you went through so much these past few years, I hope things just keep looking up for you! I have to go lay down...this surgery did take a lot out of me and I am trying to be good and get rest so I don't overcomplicate matters by overdoing it (my favorite!).  It is not like I do it purposely but more like I don't know when to slow down. OMG-I made shrimp tacos with cilantro sour cream this weekend....sooo good!     Happy trails to all-",

Glad you went to the little pink houses of hope.  Good for you.   That is great.   Yeah, just what you need is another thing to do, fighting for services for your kids, because you are, after all, not busy enough at all!

Rachel: I am with you...pain on left side where they found the mass in my liver, sono showed mass, CT showed nothing and could not MRI b/c the TE was still in my chest. Let's hope we are both just having GAS pains! If I were you living in Canada with your socialized medicine, I would totally list myself and all my skills on \"Elance\" and work from home. Also check out \"flexjobs.\" There is so, so, so many opportunities for all of you in countries with socialized medicine so you don't have to work for a freakin' corp just to make sure you have health care coverage. Freelancing and telecommuting is a dream and if I lived in Canada, that is exactly what I would be doing.  I am glad you got the management job but I also think all of us, and collectively at that, we underestimate what we have been through and I don't think putting ourselves through a grind is going to help. Be careful, listen to your body and check out flex options so you can enjoy your family more, stress less and be good to your mind, body and soul. Money ain't \"s\" without health. Lady: I am so, so glad you went to the session, things went ok and you actually have some Thanksgiving plans together. You know, keep an open mind. Perhaps things will not go back to the way they were but you also might have a friend for life or your relationship will bob-and-weave its way to a different, healthier form over the coming months. You, too, have to listen to your body and mind and before you give up even one iota of yourself or start to feel uncomfortable, just remember you can now withdraw from the source of your upset, close \"your\" front door and relax and achieve inner harmony once again with your little dogs! Whatever comes of this all, you will be fine. The most important thing now is you have your own space to retreat to when the world gets too much or something bothers you, to regroup, be good to yourself with no one putting any demands on you and where you can care only for yourself whenever you need to, without complications and nonsense of stressful, built-in problems. Enjoy! It is cold and damp here in CT today and I am going to go rest my tired achy bones and muscles in a nice, hot shower followed by some green tea! Good times! Take care, all-",

      "Content": "Nov 18, 2011 12:57AM - edited Nov 18, 2011 01:00AM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors- Because I am up until 5AM with blistering hot flashes and sweating my ass off, I guess after my shower today it was time to get some hot flash free sleep! It is so, so, so weird how I only get hot flashes at night? Weird, weird, weird. Ginger: I worked on Wall St, I brought companies public, I stock, bond and commodity traded and you are telling me there was a near hostile takeover of a MISSION?! Geesh, perhaps I better head to back to Wall St and reorganize! That is a chapter out of my days at Lehman Brothers (aka the bruthers!) ... wow, if they knew there was a market on non-prof missions, they would have set up an entirely capitalistic separate market that hedged positions and traded equity on missions and you all would have never known the difference!! Of course, the missions would have nothing to do with it but we would not care, we would create a market and RUN IT! This would be the antithesis of corporate raiding! If it weren't for the SEC (spoilers!), we might have started a market on squirrel racing! OMG...speaking of squirrel racing, when I was in college we had pretty aggressive squirrels on campus! They would chase us! In any case, I am glad you have reached some peace with the whole stepping back idea. I think we all have to step back from things we used to be very embroiled in. Now, of course, this does NOT mean you won't find me creating an options market on how many more vocally talented(?) people this country can find to populate the plethora of \"singing/voice\" shows but I guess you won't find me trading yen overnight either!  Watashi wa byoki desu nee (I am sick!)!!!  This bc has really slowed me down! Ginger, the other thing you have to remember is the good ol' US of A was not a humongous fiscal disaster with record homeless circa 1985. In fact, we were emerging from a fiscal malaise with T bonds were fetching 15%+(so our govt needed money!)!!!!   Good times!   In any case, perhaps it is fate that your now reduced efforts be seemingly redirected right back here where, Lord knows, we need some serious help. Just a thought. Calamtykel: good to hear from you! OMG...speaking of Amish, I recently saw a 60 Minutes (or the like) on CRIME in Amish country! I am totally serious. Apparently there is a rogue, splinter faction in Amish country run by an \"aggressor\" and they are breaking into the homes of those not in support of this splinter faction and cutting off their beards. It was stunning....I think I just stumbled on the new options market I am going to create!!!! He he he! In any case, this beard cutting business is high crime in Amish land. They are also cutting off women's hair. It was an interesting story. When they tried to interview the alleged aggressor, he got Amish aggressive-he kindly and calmly asked them to leave! Sounds like you had a good time. As for the health insurance, I was just talking to my sister about relocating to Canada today. Of course I would still consider Ireland also. On the cancer rates, even though they are a fraction of ours, their population is a fraction of ours. Were the bottom line numbers that different and isn't it very feasible many are dying of cancer and it is just not getting diagnosed or reported? I will agree, however, it is a much simpler life and, to be honest, what little I know of you from this thread, I would think you could move right in to Amish country and be very happy and comfortable! That grocery store sounds great. My seasonal neighbor from the beach was from Lancaster. She always encouraged me to get down there but Wall St was swallowing me alive. I hope you get back soon. I totally agree about the electromagnetic and radiation waves. Perhaps you might remember the stories quite recently of people's dogs getting electrocuted urinating in NYC or walking through puddles from all the electricity running through the ground and just everywhere. Little known fact also is conductors from the railroads generally have to get back on those trains at least once a week to get their \"dose\" of electricity after they go into retirement. Those that don't go back for their dose die quite quick after retirement because their bodies had gotten so adjusted from all that electricity running through them every day. As for me, I never, ever put those cell phones anywhere near my head and I don't ever use Bluetooth, ever. Instead, however, I take every call I possibly can on speaker and normally hold the phone near my breasts!!!!!!!!! Can you believe it? Instead of brain cancer I got bc!! So smart! Of course I am joking that keeping the cell phone near my breasts caused bc but it is a little something I thought about after dx. We are just walking through fields of this stuff daily....just live and have some fun, that is what I say, because we can't control all the rest of it! It does make you wonder, though. DON'T forget...it is National Unfriend Day and as you all know I do not speak Facebook but for those of you who do and that nice person you met on the flight to Belize is now just a nuisance of frenetic Facebook activity, UNFRIEND THEM! Consequently, Biz Markie was just on Jimmy Kimmel taking his humongous 1980s classic hit \"You Say He Just a Friend\" and reworded to the prolific lyrics (!) to accommodate the likes on National Unfriend day! Instead of \"you say he just a friend\" the lyrics became \"we might as well just unfriend!\" It made my day!!!!! Remembering being in those clubs in Manhattan that had a strict \"don't card\" policies, and at the ripe of old age of 16, while my father thought I was sleeping over my friend's house, dancing to the Biz in churches that had been turned into clubs, I was lost in my reverie listening to him perform on JKL tonight! Yes, I was dancing around my living room!!! In any case, this new \"unfriend\" version is hysterical and I absolutely had to let you all know just what you missed this evening! Well, time for spider solitaire!  ",

Perhaps because the screen is still in the front door as I have not put the storm in yet because it was almost 70 these past few days and your front door is wide open!!!!!! Calamtykel: first of all, I don't know who these women are that would let ANY man put their hands on them. Amish or not, I would beat the freakin' crap out of anybody that put their hands on me. I do, however, lift weights and I am Irish and Italian (temper) so that helps!  Of course, I grew up with 2 older brothers so I enjoyed both protection as well as being toughened up!   I agree the Amish is like a cult and I will YouTube Amish secrets.  Things always look so serene and bucolic but then you get to know the human beings that marr the scene.  It is just a shame.      I cannot believe someone is judging you for homeschooling your kids and of all places taking it to FB? Perhaps they should be thanking you for saving the municipality money on not having to educate your kids. ON FB? This guy is a loser!   How much time can this joker possibly have on his hands? It is disgusting. No, don't unfriend him, just ignore him. Honestly, with what I see go on in these schools, I think if I had kids I just might be home schooling them as well. Kids are mean and your kids are not missing anything by not being taught all the mean and creepy nonsense that has NOTHING to do with learning and everything to do with poisoning the person your child is becoming. Facebook flakes. I am glad Jimmy Kimmel started \"National Unfriend Day!\" Kel-quick question: I am seriously considering going to law school in Mass and, for this reason, I will most likely move outside of Boston. Do you know if Mass has a similar healthcare system as does NJ? Just wondering. I have a lot of research to do but just wanted to know if you had any quick insight. Hopefully there will be NO mammo-to-mammo discrepancies and good luck with that. Texas: I am so sorry to tell you but the dumb ass, lazy, drive-up bank robbers DID get money!!!!!!! It is so, so sad! I have to send this to Chelsea Lately! I almost pissed my pants when I heard this! Years ago when I worked for my mom and she had asked me one morning when I was in a particularly giddy mood to make sure I stopped at the bank for her. Well, I responded with \"I hope I don't bungle the job doing it through the drive up!\" How could somebody successfully held up a bank through the drive up window?! We had another one in CT where the person held up a McDonalds by crawling in through the drive thru window! At least this person went when the actual doors were closed and only the drive through was open! Those other jokers just rolled right up during hours when the bank was open and demanded money through the drive-up! I hope your studying goes well. I am sure you will do fine. Also, when you take notes, use \"OneNote\" and make a second page with questions on the notes. It is a good habit to get into. OneNote is great...familiarize yourself with it. I love it. I hope you all have a nice day-",

I hope you all are doing well and are feeling optimistic about this coming year ;) As it turns out, my MRI was negative but that does nothing to explain the tremendous pain in the liver region.  The other night I felt such sharp pain in my liver area I nearly doubled over.   What I can't seem to figure out is how a sonogram done in July showed, and I quote the radiologist:\"There is an area in the right lobe of different texture measuring 2.7cm.  This probably represents focal sparing but I cannot exclude the possibility of hepatic mass.\"   Why is it that this \"mass\" does not show on an MRI or CT scan but showed on a *sonogram?*   Something is not making sense.  What would you all do?  These tests are very oddly not showing anything.   Also, the disk they gave me after the MRI does not play for whatever reason in my computer, my sisters' nor my friends' computers.  This sonogram report also refers to \"paranchymal liver disease.\"  Parenchymal\" liver disease just means that they do not have a clue what is causing the problem and what ever it is that is damaging the functional cells of the liver.  I would not be concerned if this was my leg or my ass or neck but we all know bc likes to spread to brain, bones, liver and lungs.  Those are its hot spots.  How could this mass be \"hiding\" on CT scans but apparent on a sonogram?  There is something wrong here, people.   I would very much appreciate your opinions. Before the question is even asked, no one has ordered AFP blood work and as Carolyn asked about my \"tumor markers,\" those have not been tested either.  If I felt better I would be happier but I just don't.  Thanks in advance, girls-",

Calmtykel: well, woman, I am glad I am not the only one convinced I am on problem-free borrowed time!  You know how you had to remind yourself about last December? Well, I find myself \"forgetting\" things like when I emailed my onc's APRN today asking about tumor markers.  She answered my question but I am sure I asked it 5 times already!   I found out they don't do markers on Stages 1-III because they can be misleading.  In any case, before I repeat myself again I am going to keep a JOURNAL of symptoms, questions, answers etc....  and perhaps you should join me!  At the risk of sounding ridiculous, did you put your bra in the dryer by chance?  I totally know what you mean about the inexplicable pains.  I am so *&^%$ tired of trying to figure out what the heck is going on that I am just going to lift and do all my stuff and ignore these freakin' pains because according to that CT and MRI, it isn't cancer.   I guess I am wicked paranoid because it was a IIb and I wasn't radiated combined with the sono results.  You, too, might be paranoid as you did not get along with tamox so my lack of radiation and weird sono is your tamox.  I am so tired of playing the tail on the cause in my head that when I was up for my 3AM hot flash that puts me outside in a tank top!) I decided I am just not going to worry about it anymore.  I think my sister is right in that our capitalistic healthcare system, and me with my excellent health insurance, that if I keep asking questions, an element of advantageousness might take over and I don't mean Yale.  Like if I truck around for seconds or looking for problems, someone might find one for me! I hope everything works out for you on Thursday and it is NOT LE presenting.   Why now, you know?  You are right on top of it anyway and none of us are afraid to stare cancer in the face so hopefully it is not mets/recur or LE and perhaps lifting is the culprit.  Use ice and try to reduce the aggravation. Oh just great on the credit report business.  Effers.  That is going to be such a freakin' hassle to get off your credit but yet we have no recourse but to fax and beg those stupid credit reporting agencies to clean up the mess.  It is illegal and so therefore you having to fight is ridiculous but no one cares.  When I think of the mess that our credit reporting agencies are WITH govt regulations can you imagine how much worse it could be if the govt was more hands off? It is like calling Ebay for customer service!  WASTE OF TIME!  Speaking of which, if you have any trouble on Ebay with a buyer dinging you, I found a way around that as you and I both know buyers can ding and sellers can only say \"thank you, may I have another!\"  You know how they refuse to remove feedback?  Well, if you are having a problem with a buyer what is the first thing you do?  You look at their feedback.  Of course, it is all positive, right?!  NO, Lizzy figured a way around it!   I put in caps with stars, in the positive comment area, *****BEWARE**** 7 DAY NON-PAYER, CIRCUMVENTED UID****   and it is still there today!   She took her grand old time paying and then, when I did not ship immediately, she dinged me even though it clearly arrived in time.   Ebay can take the rope they put around sellers hands and shove it!  Anyway I don't sell there anymore as Ebay and Paypal together are a hot mess.  I much prefer Amazon. Well, happy New Year to you and I sure hope the news is nothing but good on Thursday.  I am sorry you have to wait but hopefully it is nothing.  I am so sick to death tired of this entire mess.  I am going to take my MRI results and just say hallelujah!!! Sptmm: DEB, I am so sorry, I failed to tell you how wonderful I thought it was that you hit your weight goal!!!!!!  That is wonderful news!   Good for you because you know, last night on the news the \"cancer\" powers-that-be know nothing about what causes cancer etc.. but now they know it is linked to weight!!!!!!!   They are such a bag of ___holes!  Right, now it is weight related...you know where this is headed!  I am still writing the comedy on how the whole of the country has gotten so fat the government is way more in our business than they should be!  In any case, I am starting to think I am clairvoyant!!!",

Calamtykel: $2-$3K in medical bills, awful as it is that you are abused by creditors, is nowhere near what some people go through as they are completely wiped out by this disease. To keep yourself away from upset, don't even talk to those creditors. The credit bureaus and credit grantors are all in bed with each other and they love getting these little bills and nailing people and as far as they are concerned, cancer or not, if their accounts are still \"living\" then they are still up for owing. It is disgusting but don't talk to them anymore. It is the equivalent of putting your head through a wall. As your credit is already dinged and they are all on your credit, it is time for the $5 a month plan. Don't race to pay anything off and whatever money your mother was going to give you, put it in an IRA and buy stock.  Grow your money now because they have all but screwed your credit so don't race to part with your money to pay jerks. What I would do is write a letter to the head of the money-hungry hospital explaining there should be some \"check and balance\" for cancer patients, making sure they are back to gainful employment etc... before there is any turnover of bills. It is ridiculous that our healthcare system provides for ruining of your credit due to health bills so that is why I say don't rush to do anything. I don't want any answers from you about this but if you own your house, sit back and relax and don't worry about a thing. Put those jokers on $5 a month and if they are calling your home phone and you *need* a home phone (for alarm purposes etc..) change it. Also, set up an additional line of service on your wireless plan and going forward have a \"bat line\" for friends and family and have a \"business line\" for warranty cards, all credit cards, banks, brokerages, insurance companies etc... Let's face it, legitimate businesses are rarely calling us. It is nefarious creeps so I say take a bifurcated approach to how you let people access you. FINALLY, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DON'T LET THE CREDIT BUREAUS KNOW YOU HAD CANCER. That is the worst thing you can do. Not only will it affect your ability to get jobs and credit, it will affect your DH's ability to get jobs and get credit. It is a travesty but on top of cancer, way before Obama, this country's administrations let's banks, brokerages, credit bureaus and insurance companies ATTACK US. We are human ATMs to the machine so please, don't reveal you had cancer. That is like putting a knife through your heart. I would sit down with your DH and decide what, if any, credit relationships you need going forward, concentrate on keeping only those relationships you absolutely need in excellent shape and don't attempt any new credit lines for a few years. Just leave it all alone. Make sure you open an IRA and before you go rushing to divorce those dollars so you can save your credit, forget about it, damage done. Put money in the market and put them on that miserable $5 a month plan. You can also get them out of your hair because they are already on your credit, they are *not* coming off and they will not help you so DON'T help them. They also can't attack you with phone calls once you are regularly paying them. Finally, don't pay them with checks or credit cards. Pay them with a money order (I know it costs but it costs a lot less than having them have your account numbers.) The really advantageous collection companies like to play the \"oops, we accidentally added a zero to your payment...sorry-but you owed us anyway so we are keeping it.\" Just be careful and if you apply for any credit going forward and anyone asks you about these medical bills, tell them you broke your legs skiing! Seriously, with the cancer business, act like a cat in the litter covering it's shit. I know they like to try to make us feel all \"kumbaya\" about still being alive and how lucky we are to have beaten cancer. Cancer sucks and that is that----it just plain sucks. I write \"odes to cancer \"and I wrote a song about cancer! Largely I do this to entertain myself but make no mistake, we have to hide the fact that we ever had cancer. Be smart, be cautious and finally, don't think that a few dollars in bills is going to \"ruin\" your credit. Remember one of my fav Twain quotes: I have been through several terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened! Don't let your mind get away from you. If you have any private questions or you want to talk, PM me. WARNING: to those of you heating with oil, thefts are on the rise. I just put $800 in November and I, as you all know, am a human fireplace (thank you cancer) so I keep my heat on 60 and it has been mild in CT. Guess who I am waiting for now? The oil man. I also went outside to look at where the pipe goes into my home and it seemed like there was fuel marks on the house AND the leaves below the fill pipe smelled of fuel. I am the last house on a dead end and there is a huge bush sheltering anyone with a $15 siphoning kit from all view and, although I can't be positive, research reveals it is apparently a crime that is on the rise. Where do they put it? In a 50 gallon drum, several 10 gallon paint buckets or gas cans! I give up! Ginger: I am so happy your mammo was clear!!!!! Very good news all around for you! That is LOL hysterical about your DGD!!!!! Perhaps she knows better than you all that her name should be \"Zoe!\" Adey: My favorite movies are the likes of: Superstar, Dodge Ball, Airplane, Old School and that general group. My friend from Jackson Hole called to castigate me for giving her false hope! Seriously? I had to watch it again. It had its moments but friends who enjoy the same movies I do would be disappointed by the lack of \"sharp\" comedy in that movie. In fact, the movie industry at large is crying about how less people are going. Well, the prices are going up and quality is going down: go figure! More to this point, they are ending up on HBO and friends as well as at Redbox pretty quick so unless it is compelling, or you are an impatient kid, there is no reason to rush off! If I paid $11 to see \"Bad Teacher\" in theaters, I would have written asking for a refund! They also could have done a lot more with that movie. I feel there is a lot missing from today's comedies. Girls, remember, we must be happy we are alive and have the opportunity of being incessantly poured over, thereby blowing more money into the cancer machine, for the rest of our existence....YAY!!!!! My sarcasm is disturbing...I know!!!! I hope you all have a good weekend-",

This is the only I have ever lived in where I don't lose power. I lived on the beach for over 7 years and when we lost power down there is was startlingly dark because of no horizon lights. I don't miss that! Thanks for your well-wishes. I miss my mom and always will. There is something so very potent about mother and daughter connection, it is everlasting. She lived on Narragansett Bay for a while and loved RI, esp Block Island. We will be having a service and sprinkling her ashes off the coast of RI. It is what she wanted. I am not doing it now, however. I am going to keep her home with me for a while ;) I know perhaps that is morose but it is a process and I am working through it. Neither of my parents wanted to be buried. They were both concerned with urban sprawl and wood boxes filled with ashes eating up the animals roaming capabilities! I wish for cremation as well. These are simply containers and the soul goes on....or so I like to think!  Everyone: do any of you receive information from the ACS? I never receive anything from them. My ex from NJ has stage II diabetes. He asked me to sponsor him last year for a ride. Of course I did. It really surprised me when he was dxd b/c he was always tall and on the thin side but it just goes to show you if you are blessed with a high metabolism and can eat and drink whatever you want, the body beautiful will catch up with you just the same! For those of us who battle weight, it is a little good news! In any case, I am on their mailing list now and boy, do I get a lot of stuff! I finally called and asked to be taken off the list but I get \"nothing\" from the ACS. I find that odd. Just wondering if anyone else is having a similar experience? That is all from here. Hope everyone is doing well-",

I will always stop by and you are all always in my thoughts.  Omaz: thanks for asking about me! I always think of everyone here. How are you feeling these days? Is your dd enjoying her little Civic?! Oh, the joys of that first car and all that independence! I loved it. Some of my fondest memories. Texas: we need an update!!!!!!  Where have you been? What are you up to?  How are you feeling?  We miss you ;)  Ginger: how are you? You did not come back to let us know what happened after that scary hospital ER visit. Please stop by and post to let us know how you are and what, praying nothing, came of the tests and follow-ups regarding what happened. I can still remember how scary that ride to the ER must have been for you. What a scary experience. OMG..speaking of scary, the woman in Norwalk, CT who was \"accused\" of stealing education took a plea deal. She plead \"guilty\" to the charge so she could spend less than 5 years in jail? I was appalled. I cannot believe that because she wanted her child to be educated in a better, and probably safer, school than he would have been in Bridgeport that she is going to jail. There is something so wrong. Bridgeport was on the news again these past few days because, and I kid you not, a landlord put 3 handicapped people out of their home on eviction. One is in a wheelchair, one can barely move, the other has cancer and they all seem to be perhaps a bit learning disabled. They called the local news to report what had happened. They actually threw their belongings on the lawn. While the news was there the phony ass landlord came rolling up and claimed to be so upset and was crying...WTF is wrong with people? I was a landlord to a house in a very socioeconomically depressed area and I had gang members in that house. I could care less that they were in a gang but they were also, and regularly, months behind on rent. I would have NEVER put them out. They would suddenly show up with a number of months of rent and then I would not hear again for a while. All I can say is although not everyone is me, where is the altruism? It is the dead of winter. People are sick...so greedy and always letting money drive the bus. A close friend's aunt owns about 30 properties in Bridgeport and she has been a landlord there for over 30 years. She has never once evicted a person. It takes all kinds. Ladyinbama: How are you doing?  You seem like your spirits are good.  I hope you continue to feel well and find some things that you enjoy doing these days.  At least you still have some decent weather in the South!   Calamtykel: it is so funny that you mention BC is so slow-growing as I was mentioning to one of my doctors about my fears bc was back and one of them said something like \"oh no, not that soon\" or not that big so soon or whatever. Of course, I had no clue bc was a slow-grower. This disease is tiring to keep track of all the details and minutiae involved. How are you doing around this time of your father's passing? I am thinking of you. I thought of you the other day also as someone was espousing about how bad Obamacare and socialized medicine will be for this country and I said \"you know what? Through (bco) I encountered women from Scotland, the UK, Ireland, Italy, Canada etc... and do you know who had the most complaints, the worst treatment, the asshole doctors and the bills getting turned over to collections? YEAH, the good old girls in the USA so stop talking about what you know nothing about.\" He just stared at me. People have no clue that Rachel and Sweeney have had an entirely seemingly unencumbered time of getting the same exact treatment we all have only we spend a lot more money and get attitudes from money-grubbing doctors who are only in it for the money. A Republican friend (creep!) likes to talk out of his ass (a favorite of the entire party!) about how all these doctors are going to leave this country and I said \"oh yeah, and where the hell are they going?! They can't make this money anywhere else on this planet!\" Of course, he did not have much to say after that. People in this country are drunk on the propaganda of how bad socialized med is and how we will all have to wait in lines to get crap done. It would be better than being demolished financially and always wondering if what they are doing is because it is necessary or because they are going to make a lot of money off of it. I am done!!! Mommichelle: I am so glad surgery went well and you are recovering! Good news. I am very happy for you. Adey: thanks for letting the girls know I am alive!  I appreciate your assistance and am so glad your butt boobs are good!  Have a good weekend, woman!  WHAT CANCER IS AND WHAT IT IS NOT! That was an amazing video! I am so glad she made it. I am going to make a place for it in our intro so that long after I am gone, women who stop by to see what us bc girls were going through back in August 2010, about to start chemo, they will happen upon the link connecting them to a visual aid of how politics, money and greed attempted to impugn this disease and the dreadful experience it becomes for every woman afflicted. A close friend always says \"this world is gone\" and I am starting to understand what he means. I think Sptmm and I are the only ones to be affected by this weekend's small snowstorm and I am very grateful, as is Deb, that we have not seen more of it! Happy trails all and I hope you have a good weekend-",

Apparently Trudeau is on the run, in some way, from the Feds, or something to that effect. My friend, as soon as he found out about my cancer, got Trudeau on the phone and he believes wholeheartedly lack of Vit D has a lot to do with cancer proliferation. In any case, I am going to read the book. I wanted to travel the cancer highway for a while before I started reading everyone's opinion on this enigmatic disease. I feel I am comfortable enough with it now to adequately digest new information/opinions about it without my racing off, trying to implement each new idea. Adey-thank you, thank you, thank you for everything!  Also, I am going to read that book. I am going to order it today, in fact. I was just telling my friend this morning about my not having eaten fast food burgers since 1988 when I found a bone in a BK cheeseburger. That was all it took! In any case, and here I sit with cancer, I tried to alert my nephew who seems to like to live on McDonald's, of the recent \"pink slime\" news and he said he saw it on YouTube. He then asked his mother to go to McDonald's and jokingly told me that I am the one with cancer and he is not so perhaps I should eat MCRAT!!!!!! PUNK! Oddly enough, though, he has a point. I did not eat their crappy food because I thought I was avoiding cancer but rather I do not like bones with my burgers! Bottom line, though, is I never had an affinity for red meat. I don't know where the devil is hiding but I am only pretty sure it is in our processed food. Sausage!!!!!! Eeeeeeks! That is one thing I cannot eat at all! At all! That meat scares me! My sister's MIL used to tell me how they made it in Italy and hung it from the ceiling overnight to dry. She told me how they got up close and personal with the skin of the intestines! Ugh...that description killed me, too! Although, and sadly, once in a blue I still crave sausage and peppers but I don't make it and won't eat it! I am a nutritional flake...nothing makes sense with me! Colloidal Silver- I know an older Jewish woman who I have known for quite some time. She was pretty worried about this cancer business with me and her family has long been in medicine. I never breach friendships with requests of professional advice etc... as I tend to think it is crass. More to this point, I have never asked her about gathering information from the professionals in her family etc... as I just figure if it is out there, I will know about it soon enough. Just this weekend I saw her and she told me that for years and years Jewish people have believed in the power of colloidal silver as a way of combating cancer. No one in her family has cancer. I am going to look into it. It is like $30 at the health food store. I think I can get it at Amazon cheaper. I will be our guinea pig!!!! BTW, if my posts stop you all know what that means, right?!!!! He he he! A little cancer humor! Calamtykel-that is the truth that you speak about the FDA, our government and the medical-industrial complex and all the misinformation. If they weren't making so much money off of treating cancer I would trust them a little more. Then again, cancer is in ever country on the planet and those with socialized med where the margins have been driven out. I just don't think if \"they\" knew about a cure etc..., they would be holding back. Cancer is killing everyone from judges to doctors to athletes and all us common folk(!) which is also why I don't read too much about cancer. There is nothing definitive and there is a lot of junk out there. I protect my mind by not perusing too much about cancer because no one has any real answers. Dr. Oz- Belly buster cake! I can watch his show like once a week because it is always information overload! I have to be sitting in my office, in front of my computer, with the TV on and ready to type up notes as I watch! In any case, he had this cake/dessert on last week. It was on Weds I believe. Made with all good stuff although we would have to skip the flaxseeds. I think you all should check it out! If anyone wants the recipe, PM me. I don't want to just toss it in the thread as it is FIVE LAYERS! My suggestion: we all embrace the song \"The Climb\" by that adorable little Miley Cyrus and just accept our wonderful cancer struggles!",

Although the cough is gone, I still feel flu-like. I wish it would go! Alkaline state: you know, there is so much to remember about this disease. I have been juicing more recently esp w/being sick. Sure enough, I made roughly 14 oz of grapefruit juice yesterday, and I do the skin (pectin is good for us!), and then realized what damage I had done, albeit temporarily, to my alkaline state! I should have had 4 oz here and there. So much to remember all the time! I just thought a nice, tall glass of juice would help me out. Perhaps I should have a cigarette the next time!!! Lady: it MAKES MY DAY to hear you had a good day! I am serious. I am so happy you went out and had some fun with the ovarian cancer girls. My hope was that once, if ever, I get beyond this mess, we could all go to the annual bc.org event. Last year, you might recall, was in Vegas. Perhaps we can all manage to go this year? I know we get discounted room rates etc... It is food for thought. Needless to say, I cancelled my Komen walk plans for this summer amid the Planned Parenthood controversy. I was kind of hoping that could have turned into a \"gathering\" but I refuse to do any walking for that mess now! Ginger: the truth is coming out!!!!!!!! I don't know if it is the ghost of my mom etc...but something gets my cat going lately, running around, crying up at the ceiling, chasing things that aren't there so I decided to start singing \"Wild Thing\" to her! I now dedicate that song to you as well!!!! Sounds like you had quite a time of it with that elevator! People riding the elevator must have gotten a charge out of that! Namaste! Ckptry, Omaz: well, you all know I drank my ass off and partied like it was 1999 right into to 2005! In any case, and very oddly, when I was dxd they said it started around 2005/2006 or just when I hung up my party hardy hat! I never stopped drinking but the \"good time\" bus came to a halt with living in CT and not wanting to go out cavorting with my \"married-single\" friends etc... so my life changed that year. I was living back in CT and the social network of fun and madness I had in my NYC days was no longer. I just wonder if putting all of that on a shelf is what caused my bc. Seriously, so I don't know if drinking has shit to do with bc and I just think they arbitrarily pin the tail on whatever freakin' donkey they can find. I also think their \"drinking\" studies have more to do with carbs, which seems to really be a demon when it comes to cancer, rather than the liquor itself. More to this point, if you all drink vodka/bourbon/rum w/a splash of water and a piece of fruit, no carbs and I don't know what else to say about that! If you are drinking White Russians, that might have a direct impact on recurrence! I am with your, Carolyn, in that I still drink on occasion. I did before and it seemed when I slowed down is when bc started so as far as I am concerned, they just don't know much about the causes of bc. It almost makes me laugh when they start with their warnings about specific things as if they know something we don't! I think however you define fun is what you have to stay in touch with and none of the crap they warn about, until they know the \"cause,\" should be taken seriously. To each their own but, and this is for you Carolyn, PARTY ON, GARTH!!!!!!!!! (I am Wayne...!) Omaz: your dd probably felt uncomfortable when you drank b/c you were cutting into her supplies!!!!! My father had a bar but he NEVER drank so, of course, it was fodder for the party bus my sister, brothers and I were always riding on! I learned the \"water\" trick early on! He would get bottles for the holidays and just put them in the bar of no-use! We were always like \"yee ha\" when we saw someone show up with those pretty, gloss bottle boxes and bags! More for us! Well, I hope you all have a good day and do something fun today. I would be lying if I told you all that sitting in bed watching old movies these past few days while I try to get myself over this flu (so I can have surgery next week) has been a task! Especially today, it is perfect movie-watching weather! Tex: I found my alternative to Crunchberries (was craving like a child!) = Raisin Bran Crunch!!!!  Happy trails-",

I am about 1/2 way through Trudeaus' book....amazing.  He seems to make an awful lot of sense.  As I can't seem to fully get rid of this flu/bronchitis I decided rather than think about mets/recurrence, let me start to study the body as the ecosystem it is!  I will be sharing key points along the way.  I make notes on this book and am actually planning to read it again right away!  When I find a book this valuable I generally read it twice for good measure!  One take-away that I wanted to share today is urban rebounding.  You all know I have worked out my entire life battling weight and I never realized the health benefits, especially for me now as a bc survivor, that urban rebounding brings to the table.  Apparently it energizes all your cells and when I thought about it, it makes a lot of sense.  There is no other exercise like it and it is fun!  I used to take classes at Bally's all the time.  Of course I went downstairs and brought my mini trampoline up!  He says the 3 best things we can do to correct the perceived \"imbalance\" that caused bc is to walk, do yoga and rebound.   I was also sad to find out, in associated research, that the one thing I love and eat regularly, pickles, are very acidic :(   I guess I am going to have to cut to 1 pickle a week! Finally, for anyone is a self-proclaimed \"funk,\" I am burning all CDs into my computer.  I just got finished doing the \"Doobie Brothers\" Rockin' Down the Highway!  For anyone feeling down, fire up your MP3s/Is etc... and play \"Listen to the Music!!\"  That is bound to cheer you up!  People still don't know what to say/are grossly or not informed at all: someone I know pretty well asked me today why I did not just take the \"chemo pill!\"  I think aside from doing a play and taking it on the road to teach people, in a comedic way, about c/bc but it would also be nice to have a site anyone that has a friend/family member etc.. who has cancer can visit to learn what NOT to say!  Good day, all...weather in CT is nearly 75 today!!!!!!  It is lovely!! ",

      "Content": "Mar 21, 2012 08:47AM - edited Mar 21, 2012 08:50AM by 1WonderWoman Hello my lovely warriors! Well, I went to my annual gyn gig and all is fine and 2-3 weeks on the pap results but she said everything looks good. I discussed that endometrial lining business and she said generally that is more a concern with women who were already in menopause when they found out about bc and then went on tamox. I also could have misunderstood but the takeaway is everything seems fine with my lady parts and that is all, that is all! Vitamin D3: it is said that they preponderance of the people in this country are deficient in this and, of course, cancer folks, diabetics and those that suffer from heart disease are overwhelmingly deficient, to one degree or another. My friend who called Trudeau shortly after I was dxd said the one thing he told my friend was Vitamin D deficiency is the culprit in a lot of illness. I ran across this information while doing some other research which brought me to Vitamin D3, as follows: In the United States, serum levels of 25(OH) D3 are below the recommended levels for a large portion of the general adult population and in most minorities, indicating that Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in the country.[8] According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements, most people in the United States can meet their vitamin D needs through exposure to sunlight, even though a large portion have serum 25(OH)D3 levels below recommendations As we head into nicer weather, I thought I would mention this. I was stuck in traffic today on the highway due to a massive accident (there are like 4 a day in this small ass state!) and instead of listening to music and instead of trying to ignore truckers while they act like pigs (he he he!), I decided to shut my eyes and just soak up the sun! It felt great! Ginger: that is a very, very big deal that you have sun!!!!!!!! Thanks for the clarification. I know, people are just morons. Why would a learned person need to ask me such a ludicrous question about why I would go to the hospital and take 3 different kinds of chemo for 6 hours straight as opposed to going to just taking a pill?! I am actually much happier now, and because I have hair again, to not even let anyone know I ever had cancer. I am very much working to put this behind me for good. Tex: yes, they are going to be on the show...I have just been thinking, from a production perspective, perhaps I need to change the name of the show as I am not sure anyone is going to come on with the current name!!!! I am glad you had fun camping. There is something nice about being out in the woods, just you and your sleeping bag although I am nervous even thinking about it! It is good to get away, though, and I am sure the kids just loved it. TEX---get to your annual gyn appt. I know it is horrifying to keep going to all these docs but you really should get a move on, woman! Lady: music is wonderful therapy! I had a temperamental ficus and when I moved it out of my office to my home, it threw a fit! I played Pavarotti and classical music, in a steady rotation, for about a month and that bitch came back! Ficus are rough to move...they get so upset!  In any case, keep up your wonderful walks and listening to that music!  It is good for your soul.  Another startling stat I ran across is how people in Europe walk an average of 8 miles per day and we here in the US walk less than 1 mile per day.  I find it hard to believe those in Europe are walking 8 miles per day but it was interesting anyway so walk away, Lady!  I am so glad you got an ALL CLEAR from your doc!!! YAY!! I will be so very, very happy to not have to go to doctors again soon enough. Once I get over this last hump, I am pretty sure I am done with docs for a long, long time. I don't want to see them anymore! I am so wanting to leave bc in my dustbin of history, it is not even funny! I am quite positive I am not alone on this one. Well, it is so beautiful these days that I plan to get at least 20 minutes of Vitamin D for the next few days! The more I think about that deficiency, it seems all the preponderance of employees in this country do is go and spend 8 to 12 hours a day in a building toiling away. They might be on to something. Have a lovely evening, girls-",

I guess I just feel like things are heading back to normal and I am looking forward to enjoying these events.  It feels good!  So, yes, stay busy and make up for those 2 years.  That is what I plan to do ;)      So as not to disappoint I am going to complain about weather!!  It is freezing here tonight!   Night all-   ",

      "Content": "Apr 12, 2012 12:20PM - edited Apr 12, 2012 12:20PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! I hope you all are doing well. Ginger: I was traveling and just got back last night. Sure enough, I thought things were going to be fine on the final 3 hour leg of my journey and a woman showed up w/2 kids- approx 5 & 7! I think you all know I never wanted kids or marriage and that was by design, not by accident!  So, yes, I am one of those travelers that cringe when the kids show up! In any case, and very lucky for me, I have rather expensive headphones that work great so I was able to listen to \"The 3 Tenors\" for those hours and not to whining, crying, craziness! It was wonderful and I was glad but I also did my smile-and-be-nice-to-the-kids bit (of course they are attracted to me for reasons I will never know!). In any case, I know what great voices sound like but I don't suspect I will find those on AI! I just think AI is a collection of good voices, not great. More to this point, that guy Joshua that everyone is so crazy about, I really don't like at all. I don't like that raspy screaming at all. I think that sounds awful. I did not set the DVR so I did not see it last night but I do really like \"The Voice.\" I actually watched that in lieu of DWTS the other night. I know those AI and DWTS threads are on this site. Perhaps I will check them out one day. I asked a friend, who is a professionally trained singer, what he thought of Joshua. He said that screaming is just noise. He did say Cavanaugh trails off in her lower register and Elise is a rocker. He said Skylar is good and that too much is being made of Jessica. I find it incomprehensible I used to trade many, many dollars for a select group of clients in our thriving financial markets for years and now the drama in my life is provided by AI/DWTS/The Voice!! BC has led me squarely into unchartered territory! Calamtykel: Kel, the last time I saw my gyn she asked me again if I was spotting and/or having my cycle. She said if it comes back, that is fine but if there is any spotting, weird cycling etc... I definitely need to get in to her office ASAP. I don't tell you this to scare you, and I am on tamox so that might be why they are so concerned about spotting, but I do think you need to tell your onc or gyn about what is going on. What I do still have is alternating numbness in both hands and pain in my liver, like a contraction and release type of pain. Not good! Eventually whatever is going on will most likely make itself known in a far more substantial way! OMG...I was just telling a friend how much I miss working in NYC, seeing him, seeing old friends, the action, the energy, the shows, off Broadway, the clubs that seem to have no median age and my overall experience that I felt while working there. Just now on the news, as I worked for Lehman Brothers in World Financial Center in lower Manhattan, they just evacuated WFC 2 as the mail screeners found a grenade in a FedEx envelope. That would not keep me from going back but it is a reminder of a time I don't want to remember. Of course, an ex of mine reminds me, regarding going back to work in NY, stress kills and post-bc I should be concerned with that. Well I also think not doing what you want, working where you want etc... has a stress connected to it that can't even be measured. Bottom line, we are only here for a while and I am not going to spend time trying to avoid doing the type of job I love because of stress as I think unhappiness is way more stressful and upsetting. I hope you all have a lovely day! Happy trails-",

Tex: wasn't that video visceral?!  Alliterations aside, I am glad I put the link in the thread introduction so others might stumble over this thread, years down the road, and be grateful for how far things have come.    Oh, I know that drug, the on that starts with a \"G\"- it is called GREED!   I cannot believe this healthcare system.  I am almost certainly leaving this country if I survive this mess and get a breather.  I am so out of here.  This healthcare system sucks.  It is not healthcare, it is \"healthy\" care and as soon as you need it, the problems start.  I want to know that for the 55% I pay in taxes that at least I have healthcare. BTW, I like to keep things light, but I guess you are not a Blake Shelton fan?!  (*yes, I deleted that \"parenthetical\" comment!...not thinking..!)   Good luck with the tent.  Winnebago tents are largely made of a gortex-like material.  I am sure it is going to be fine and you all will have many, fun family outings in it ;)  Errands, phone calls, blah!  Of course I am still having numbness in my left arm and most unfortunately my massively expensive Android phone fell in water because I lost feeling on that side and dropped the brick!  To buy it off Ebay/Amazon, it is $400 and of course the carrier will sell it to me for full-retail, or $600!  I am in the luscious, wonderful contract.  I promise you all this right this minute: I will never, never, never again go in contract with a wireless provider.  If I can buy phones for $400 off of Ebay/Amazon and stay out of contract, that is exactly what I am going to be doing.  There is absolutely no sense to stay in contract when I have to go to market to buy a phone.  BTW, I have been the \"model\" customer for over 7 years and had never made a request like this.  Of course, with surgery coming up, I want to stay with the same phone so I don't have to learn a new one and still there was nothing they would do.  Well, when I start getting all those phone calls about taking on new contracts I am going to tell them the same thing: Sorry, there is nothing I can do!   ",

      "Content": "May 28, 2012 03:33PM - edited May 28, 2012 03:40PM by 1WonderWoman Good day , warriors! Thanks to our wonderful troops, both present and posthumous, who have made it possible for us to enjoy such freedoms and a beautiful weekend.  So in my travels this weekend, I was at a party with a few medical professionals. One of them was \"holistic\" and the other \"medical industrial complex!\" In any case, a friend of a friend told them about my situation and they said, and agreed, unequivocally that Vitamin D **and** iodine are fundamental to our success in attempting to negate recurrence. I did some research on Japan and they have the lowest bc, thyroid problems and obesity rates amongst women in just about the entire world. Perhaps some of you know I speak Japanese. More to this point, in my Wall St days I was using the language much more and I would also go to get sashimi, almost daily, with one of my bosses. I was also getting a lot more kelp via roles and Hijiki salad, pre-2005 which, consequently, was when I was dxd with thyroid problems. Sure enough, in 2008 my mammo showed \"shadows.\" When I worked trading on Wall St, lunch was often referred to as being for \"pikers!\" Long story about that word! In any case, I normally would arrive at 8/8:30ish, break at 4 for \"lunch\" which was almost always Japanese, followed by \"cracktails (the Wall St word for cocktails!)\" and then back to work until roughly 7:30/8PM. The hours were long but the money was fantastic. More to this point, I was consuming a Japanese diet regularly. I was probably having sushi/sashimi/rolls 3-4 times per week. Funny how the thyroid bus pulled up and then the bc bus shortly thereafter when, through lifestyle changes, I inadvertently distanced myself from my NY lifestyle and the consumption of a lot of Japanese food. I know Sptmm is running marathons and Calamtykel is making the most of her soil harvest in NJ. Ginger is enjoying her family and her flowers and Ckptry and I have refused to give up our (occassional in her case!) wine/beer! I know Texasrose continues to struggle, at least in part, with the test results regarding this bedraggled disease and she always does so with much aplomb and dignity; Omaz is getting herself plenty of VitaminD in the Southwest and I am sure she has made a few changes as well. I have tried to limit stress, do a bit more yoga and try to get more of the stuff, nutritionally, that is known to fight this cellular disaster. The bottom line, though, is we have all been left trying to make little changes and not thinking we can control cancer through this process but trying to make small lifestyle changes that might help us exonerate ourselves of responsibility in revisiting this disease. I think Sweeney and Rachel have also made perhaps small changes even if it means going to a group bc sessions or running more etc... My point is this: all the little changes we have made could conceivably add up to something great. I don't intend to imply I might control cancer through little changes but I find you all remarkable and hope we all have many, many more years on this planet. More to this point, taking more Vitamin D and buying/using your bamboo mat to make California rolls at home so you can get some iodine perhaps cannot hurt. All these little things just might mean great changes for us in the greater scheme. I am off my soapbox!!! Seriously, though, those 2 medical professionals meant what they said about D and iodine. It is worth a shot, folks, simply worth a shot. It is not like you all have to go on a steady diet of squirrel to achieve this! Ladyinbama: It is hot HOT here as well! I think we crossed 90 today but I did get my Vitamin D in ! Get a pool ASAP! You only live once! I had a great beach house w/very, very little property but in the back, next to the garage, I put in a child pool and I would float around on my speedboat tube with my drinks in that little pool! It was \"the best!\" My seasonal neighbor would come over as well-loved her! Her and her husband were great and her Border Collie would watch the Yankees through my window! In any case, the pool does not have to be big is my point! Of course, CT has many, many jellyfish in August so that is the month when my little pool saw the most action! Tex: drunk bus would be great but the *&^^%%$$# insurance companies will not allow it! I was thinking of perhaps doing a drunk rickshaw!! No insurance required. You know, the cabs would not even have to be free if they would issue \"prepaid\" cab cards. Things to come, no doubt! Ginger: I am so glad you are enjoying your family and the bouquet outside your window! You really do inspire me to do more planting! I have not done much....but, like I mentioned a few weeks ago, I did plant another rose bush. A big step for me! Calamtykel; LOVE the new avatar! We are starting to look like we used to! I told a friend about the autopsy thing. Sure enough, it is a truth. I seriously think, and I could be wrong, through diet and stress-elimination(reduction) we all might be able to conquer this crap.Good luck with the kale. I wish I could eat more of it. I was disappointed to find it is nutritionally antithetical w/my thyroid problem. SO I have had a good weekend!!!!! Perhaps you all could have figured that one out! Get your iodine and Vitamin D and let's party on into the future!!!!!!! Good times, good stuff (if you all wonder where this comes from it is \"Along Came Polly\" when Alec Baldwin is talking to Ben Stiller in the bathroom, at the urinal no less, about how his wife cheated on him w/a scuba instructor on their honeymoon!!!!) !! Happiest of trails, girls!! After all, we are all \"still here!!\" I LOVE YOU ALL!!!  Happy Memorial Day Weekend! ",

Omaz: I might be wrong but the parkway system in the Northeast is rife with dead deer.   The Connecticut parkway is literally a deer cemetary.   They are hit by cars, dragged to the side of the road by the DOT or State Police (just to get them off the road) and then they are left there to rot.  The state has *no system* for dealing with the deer carcass.  No one cleans it up off the side of the road, nothing. About 6 years ago I sent a very comprehensive municipal underwriting proposal to the State of CT DOT.  They were resistant and then 1 year later there were a bunch of layoffs amidst some corruption charges/allegations.  One of the worst things that is happening is deer are \"consumming\" the carcass of the dead deer on the side of the road.  At some point, it rots to the point where they can't tell it was once one of their own.  The bonds would have been such a slam dunk withe people in that county.  Purchasing a municipal bond meant to deal, at least in part, with the Lyme Disease problem and to stop having deer slaughtered all summer on the parkway would have been a very attractive investment.  Of course this was also before Moody's went crazy and downgraded the full faith and credit of the United States etc...!  The proposal would have gotten them, over the course of time, off the parkway and onto foot bridges that would allow them to cross the parkway safely.  Of course training them would take time but all in good time; it can be done.  Every 4th or 5th pass would also trigger a gantry system that would apply tick spray.   The foot bridge system works in the UK.  In any case, another summer of deer slaughter all over CT highways but primarily the parkway and in Fairfield County. All I can think is that sanctuary is picking up the babies of vehicularly slaugtered parents.  On that note, and for whatever reason they are finding the babies and taking them in, they are doing very benevolent work.  That is my guess as to why there are \"so many.\"   ",

I am watching AGT and people are swallowing swords etc.... I watch w/1 eye open! Omaz: I just got a menopause panel about 2 weeks ago. Your post reminded me I did not get the results yet. Bottom line is that I might be switched to an AI but that staying on Tamox is just fine. She said it was not necessary to change. I do get nervous when my hot flashes change because it makes me think the estrogen is coming back. In long, I feel more comfortable with hot flashes! I can't believe your ovaries came back to life but I guess the efficacy, in your case, of the femara was negligible. On that note I would be plenty happy to get back on Tamox! As for my cycle, I have not had it in over 2 years. I did, however, have an absolute nightmare recently that it \"came back\" with a vengeance. It was awful. I am so glad it is gone even though I was one of those that had it for 4 days, no pains, relatively light. For me now, if it came back, it is a sign that estrogen has gotten going again so I don't want it! Funny how bc causes you to despise and fear almost everything about your being that is \"female!\" Calamtykel: sounds like a very productive and laborious day! I got tired reading that. I think the energy comes from just getting tired of looking at something.  I wish I had that much energy!  I am happy you got through that room.  Sense of accomplishment comes to mind.  Why don't you check Ikea or online for \"carpet tiles.\"  They use them all the time on HGTV, they are very durable, you can just replace one in case of staining/damage and you can certainly inject some nice colors into any room...or not!  Something to consider.   They are very inexpensive as well and largely can be likened to indoor/outdoor carpet. Found some at Overstock: www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/...  Tex: hope you are doing well and feeling good ;) Hope your trip goes well. I was so excited today to find out that my hair is long enough to pull back in a hair elastic and I actually have a small ponytail! Before all this, my hair was not ½ way down my back but pretty close. In any case, I was kind of \"known\" for wearing my hair like the women in that famous Robert Palmer video \"I Didn't Mean To Turn You On.\" In fact, twice on Halloween I went out as \"one\" of them! One year there were 4 of us and my friend Geoff was Robert Palmer! Good times! We went to Webster Hall where my friend and I proceeded to break from the group and take advantage of passing Batman back and forth between us on stage!!! Reminds me of another song...\"oh what a night!\" In any case, I am so happy that w/some gel, I can put it back like that again and it stays!!!!!! It is long enough, alas it is long enough ;) Have a good night, all- ",

I had been on Tamoxifen for 6 months--no periods, had the test that says I metabolize it well. Tamoxifen is not going to reduce those levels, that is not its function. Tamoxifen functions by blocking the estrogen you have from plugging into some estrogen receptors. It blocks estrogen from plugging into breast cancer cells local and distant, but it has an estrogenic effect on our bones, and heart--which is good, it is better on our bones and heart than AIs. That same estrogenic effect is what can cause uterine cancer, and clots--kind of like being on the pill. Why do you think your estridol should be less than 20? Post-menopausal women are 45 or below, but if you are pre-menopausal your body will have higher levels even on Tamoxifen. If you want to lower your levels and are pre-menopausal ask your onc about chemical suppression of your ovaries, or surgical, which is what I did, but I'm 49 and done having kids. I'm staying on Tamoxifen, even though I had my ovaries out. I thought it was pretty interesting especially b/c the author seems to know a lot about tamoxifen and its affect, or lack of, on estrogen.",

She is handling it all with much aplomb and dignity but the facts of her situation still tug on my heart strings. I find her very inspirational. Ginger: yes, I too have lost faith in our government's ability to take care of the important stuff. I do think the healthcare issue is a big one and is very much going to monopolize the focus of our government for a number of years. Tough to figure.

Bottom line, I need to really step it up.  As we are both post-chemo, wanted to know if you noticed an \"appreciable\" difference.

I hope everyone is doing well this fine evening!  Ginger: I am so glad you got your haircut and it sounds just fabulous!!!! I am so happy, you sound so wonderful and like you are just feeling great! It is so enthralling! That is great that you got humongous return credits and were able to get yourself some nice things. It makes you feel better. I bet your DD is happy with the gift card also ;) I just love that you sound so happy and like you are feeling good and looking good...this warms my heart. It really does. It is so odd that you mention bras and fittings. Roughly 15 years ago, I worked part time for a lingerie shop. I was working, daily, with many women who had bc and were coming in for prosthesis. I totally forgot about that until you mentioned getting fitted. In any case, it was at that time I realized how important a good fitting was. I was, however, hooked on Victoria's Secret sets and, sad to say, the \"Wonder Bra!!\" I did not use the puffers but I did very much like that bra. It was a well-made item. In any case, so glad I don't have to worry about bras anymore! As for the doxy and cytoxan connection to leukemia, I think it is perhaps in the 30% range but I could be wrong. I sure hope none of us are in that number. We all seem pretty happy and well adjusted as we deal with this disease so I think, at least in part, that certainly will benefit us. As for haircuts, a friend put me on to a friend of hers who has been doing hair out of her home for about 5 years after leaving an exclusive salon. I am going to wait until October and then let her have a go at it. My hair came back *exactly* as it was before bc and chemo which is dark brown and wicked curly! Like last night I used my horse shampoo and hit the sack. Woke up looking like Little Orphan Annie! Oddly I am no longer seeing grays unless they are just buried in this nest! I have not straightened it in a while, as there is no sense with the CT humid summers, so I think the first time I will really get an idea of length and/or grays is the first time I straighten it, most likely early October. I am going to let my curls go wild this summer! My hair is thick...very thick. Calamtykel: That is great that you are sitting next to the incubator waiting for the chicken to be born! That does suck about the running and the tendon issue. I hate that it happened to you. I know you loved running. You know, the Arc Trainer at the gym is a fine alternative and there is a Life Fitness machine that has the arm function and the pedals are short, fat and move in an elliptical motion. My friend David and I, one very rainy Spring, used that as we could not run much. It was a good option but I don't get the idea you are a gym rat nor do you have time for it. What a trifecta of issues for your poor DH. That is just plain scary that apnea can lead to cancer. Geesh...would have never made that connection. That is just startling. Good luck with your little peep! I find you very interesting and inspirational. The stuff that you do between the chickens and growing everything, I don't know, I just think it is great. Tex: please stop by and let us know how you are doing. I want to know if you got your meds. Basil: I picked up a plant at the Farmer's Market a few weeks ago. I asked the cute boy at the basil stand how easy it was to kill! He said a little water, a little sun and you are good! Sure enough it is over a foot tall so I got some fresh mozz and you all know where I am going with this! Roma tomatoes, a little EVOO, mozz and tons of basil! Some Italian spices also. This is my favorite summer dish if there ever was one. I have been eating it for days! It got me thinking, I might give sage, rosemary, and a few other spices a whirl this summer. Next summer I am going to have a garden for sure. My friend is growing tons of asparagus! It is so good. Kale for groundhogs: I bought too much kale at the market so I am going to give some excess to my lovely family of ground hogs who have the entrance to their den at the edge of my yard. My neighbors don't love my feeding of our ground hogs so this will be done surreptitiously in an hour or 2!!! While at the market, though, I saw a friend of a friend who is a nurse and she too has a thyroid problem. I discussed the goiterogenic nature of kale and she said it is ok to eat raw but not every day, like perhaps maybe every other. I am so glad I feel comfortable again eating some raw kale in my salads! She also told me synthroid should be taken 4 or 5 hours after I take my multivitamin. I was stunned. Never heard that=good info! Marshmallow vodka white Russians! What a departure from kale!! A friend hooked me up with this little diddy recently! OMG...so good! I think I am the only liquor head on our thread, however!!!! It was made with the marshmallow vodka, kahlua and skim milk!!!! So very good...too good! Continue to have fun and enjoy yourselves! We must make the most of every day!",

Ginger: several times in the NY days when I had to choose either food or liquor (my metabolism can't handle both!!!!!), I had many a white Russian on an empty stomach so I know full well what you were feeling!  They are actually filling so having them for dinner worked out!  I was a size 6/8 and was wicked toned so it was all good!  One other kahlua and vodka drink the marshmallow vodka plugs into nicely is a mind eraser!  Equal parts kahlua, vodka and soda.   Those 3 items are to be put in the glass in just that order and then grab a straw and \"shotgun\" it!   That will help you forget your troubles fast!  A guy that worked for my mother was about 5 years older than I.  One night we just so happened to be very drunk, standing in front of Toad's Place in New Haven when the Rolling Stones stopped by to do an impromptu concert!!!!  Dan was old enough to get into Toad's but I was 19.   We were standing in front lamenting the fact that I could not get in and then when the Stones showed up pandemonium ensued and I GOT IN the side door!!!!!  Yes, I saw the Stones in a venue that would normally hold maybe 400 people on a packed night!  It was amazing!  I would remember a lot more if it weren't for those mind erasers Dan and I drank at a restaurant where pretty much anyone over 14 got served! I don't blame my relatives for leaving Ireland during the potato famine....GO VODKA!!!  ",

Of course they will have fingerprint access and a prepaid medical marijuana card but all I can think is how many of these jokers are going to be stolen!! I can also see people getting mugged at the machines although pot heads are generally a peaceable group! I started the Couch--thank you! Here we go! I can already feel a sense of accomplishment and tomorrow is just the end of week 1!!!  It just makes you feel like you are getting somewhere. Omaz: years ago I went out with a guy who liked to scuba dive. I went a few times and it was really fun. It is so peaceful and it is amazing what you can get up close and personal with! Technology, relative to water proof cameras, is so much better today, I can only imagine you got some great shots! Good for you. Sorry to hear about your back, though. At least you were able to snorkel though. Sptmm: yeah, I kind of figured you noticed a big difference. I cannot wait until 4 weeks from now when I can lay down 2 miles and feel GRRRRRREAT!!!!!!! As for the link, trying again: http://wtvr.com/2012/06/19/cancer-detected-by-breath-test/ http://www.medicaldaily.com/news/20120606/10186/breathalyzer-breath-test-breast-lung-cancer.htm I am also going to PM you the links. It feels great just knowing they are making some strides with this. All those scans are just tantamount to disaster for us bc girls! It is a bit of an oxymoron we must be exposed to cancer-causing agents as we attempt to find out if our cancer has spread/is back! Calamtykel: I know you are tending to your newborns! I hope everything went well. Rachel: tonight I used my horse shampoo and then did a leave in hot oil treatment and my hair feels fantastic! I have all the windows open as it is a beautiful night and it just air dryed and feels like silk...so nice. I get these little hot oil treatment tubes at Sally Beauty. I am sure you have a place in Canada where you can buy them or check Amazon. You can also just use olive oil that has been slightly warmed in the micro. You will have to rinse that out but I am sure you knew that already ;) Well, that HGTV grip is upon me again! \"Design Star\" is back on and I am addicted, as per usual! I just love that show. I mean I really just love HGTV as I have told you all. Speaking of HGTV, for years I thought I might go and live in Japan for a while but as I am looking at \"House Hunters International\" I have decided, with the microscopic living spaces and congestion this poor young couple is being confronted with, my interest in doing such is long over! I mean the Fukushima business last year pretty much did it for me but this show is a reminder of how old and set in my ways I am getting! I will go and visit and of course I will be going to the Great Wall when I do my next Asian trip but will not be moving! I take back my words about the small housing spaces as they are looking at a \"largish\" one right now! It actually has a really big tub! One thing bc has done is made me grateful to say I am getting old!!! I took a pic of the sunset tonight as it is supposed to be 100 here tomorrow.  It really looks like a fireball dangling in the sky.  I took it out my dining room window b/c I had just gotten out of the shower but what a show the sun put on tonight!  I wish I could post pics here...aggravating!  Night all- ",

BTW, on the marijuana dispensers, our Gov now says that was wishful thinking on the part of the manufacturer and that those machines are on a long list of things that will never happen in CT!  Geesh, between the casinos and if marijuana vending machines came to pass, we might as well change the name of the state from Connecticut to \"New Nevada!!\"   Omaz: beautiful pic!  At one point some years ago I had a 100 gallon fish tank.  I just find watching them to be very peaceful...as did my cat!  Good day, girls! ",

Rachel and Tex: thank you both very much as my last Couch workout was Saturday and I was about to play lazy ___ and ride the recumbent bike for 45 in lieu of doing my couch workout!  You all have motived me ;)  One thing you can both look forward to is each workout gets easier, and thereby less strenuous, and you really see progress.  It is a measurable progress also.  I like it!  Happiest of trails and get running, girls!  Our 2 year anniversary (since starting chemo) is coming up and it is my suspicion if we all start running it is a down payment on many, many more anniversaries!  Speaking of anniversaries, I got a few gifts from good old friends marking my 2 year since bmx!  One of which I really love which is a Yankees chair, you know they kind that fold up and go in a sleeve that you sling across your back, and it also has a cooler in it!  It is wicked cool!  It was from an ex and the note read \"get out and enjoy!\" I thought it was very, very thoughtful...but then again, he always was!  Ok, so I am going to put on my Willie Nelson wig and strum my guitar as I sing \"to all the men I have loved before...!\" At least I loved them for a time...just not forever!!!!!! ",

It was only out for like 2.5 hours but I was sweating and hot flashing so bad, off to the cool shower I went! Not once but twice! I am so glad that patrol officer let you sit in their car. You poor thing, what a time to run out of gas in that dreadful heat. As for the couch, I would just do it as it states. Don't adjust for the stroller. Reason being is you would most likely be using that stroller for the next handful of years (I imagine) so no need to adjust now. Cktpry: good to hear from you!!!!! NJ shows up all at once (Calamtykel)!!! A friend had a child who was giving her cause for concern and he, too, would behave like a little angel with the doc was there. Finally she nanny cammed him. Talk about embarrassed!!!! He was so stunned when they played the video and attempted to discuss what was going on. It might work, I just thought I would let you know what one friend did who was struggling with her son misbehaving. Glad you are having a good summer and some fun with the kids! That doc who suggested you give up your home and move to a wealthier district ===bonkers!!!!!!! Geesh, all that would accomplish is \"well, there were similar problem/complaints in her hold district...\" etc.. and that would just complicate matters. I am sure her heart was in the right place, as she drove out of sight in her $100K SUV!!!! Speaking of that SUV, I was going out with a guy who was incredibly wealthy and his daughter was going on the ivy tour with her friend. Her friend had a Porshce Cayenne SUV (all of 17 years old!) and his daughter was complaining her Tundra was no longer good enough and she needed that Porsche. He was on my sofa lamenting the fact that he was not comfortable spending $100K on that SUV!!!!! I could not believe it! I immediately got up and made myself some liquid anesthesia!!!!! I asked him how that vehicle would make her life better = no answer! Seriously?! People are just crazy! In any case, good to hear from you again. As for grilling veg, I love mushrooms, the little whole ones, right off the grill! Nothing but their awesomness! Also, I have been roasting red peppers on the grill and making this fab turkey burger w/horseradish cheese *inside* the burger and I top it w/grilled mango, those yummy roasted red peppers and some arugula!!!!!! Soooo good!!! Calamtykel: my boy, Sanjay Gupta, on CNN said it is $95 for the first year and then going to $695! That is where I heard it. Also, here is a link from the Cancer Legal Resource Center explaining how we cancer folks benefit from this legislation: http://hosted.verticalresponse.com/680390/23c827f097/281707761/2fe0db1d3f/ Here is the 95 to 695 link: http://www.obamacarewatch.org/primer/individual-mandate The best way around the income thing is to develop an LLC and all your sales put into the LLC and don't take out more than you need. This will reduce your income so grotesquely you just might qualify for something! As for the economy, consistently and consistently dealing with the very, very sick in critical mass is awfully expensive and there is no way to manage that. Can you imagine sitting at your desk in Washington and reading data that another 500K strolled into ERs all across the country massively sick? There is no management in that; there is just wicked high cost. In any case, in a civilized country maliciously middle class individuals should not have to suffer until so ill they roll into the ERs very, very sick. It is just not a civilized way to run a country at all.  There are no quick and easy solutions either.  We are on our way to a fully socialized medical care system but this is just our first, and very small step. Eventually our taxes are going to go up and we will be at socialized levels of taxation but also the hope his your kid's (or your kids' kids) can walk into a doctor or hospital and no longer have to fork over their medical card and copays or be marginalized and, although they don't \"not\" treat the uninsured, they don't necessarily \"treat\" them either. I have heard of kombucha tea and as far as I am concerned, I will try anything! Especially something terribly innocuous as tea! I am considering having a \"live\" chat for our 2 year anniversary. We can have it right here on this thread.  If we can commit to a time and date, it would be great. I know everyone is busier now but perhaps we can make it happen. If not, I totally understand but 2 years is a long time and I hope you all Couching it to get ready for that Revlon 5K in NYC next year!!!!  Perhaps that will drag us all from virtual land to LIVE LAND!!!  I hope you all have had a good weekend and are celebrating our country's birthday with verve!!!!!!!",

      "Content": "Jul 3, 2012 12:35PM - edited Jul 3, 2012 12:39PM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors- As for the \"live chat,\" you don't need any special equipment!  I just figured I would set up a date in early August, perhaps a Wednesday or Thursday evening, where we will all commit to being online at the same time and we can just chat right here.  It would be fun if we were all on at the same time, talking about our highs and lows since we started this battle.  I think it will be fun!  Just a half hour or so. I am still organizing it mentally! Rachel: you are undoubtedly going to be exposed to a lot of information on our very convoluted healthcare and Obamacare right here on this site. Here is the basic story: If you are employed full-time, *most* of the time you have some sort of benefits package through that employer.  You have to pay fees every month to be on the employer and the bigger the company, the better your benefits usually are. If you are a full-time govt employee, state or federal, you usually have great benefits and for life in most cases. If you work part-time or not at all, you have no insurance. If you are dead broke with no income you can get on welfare *only* if you have kids. If you are broke with no kids, most states have plans but how can you buy something if you have no money?  These are the uninsureds. If you are a healthy entrepreneur, you can buy what I call \"heart attack\" insurance through Golden Rule et al but there are huge deductibles and I call it \"heart attack\" b/c that is about what it will cover. If you are an entrepreneur with a pre-existing condition, you are SOL until 2014 when Obamacare kicks in which allows you to get insurance, in the open market, with no lifetime cap on what the plan will pay and they also can't charge inordinate amounts.  They also can no longer \"pre-exist\" anyone. You see, we have a messy, messsy, fragmented healthy-care system; once you get sick, the system fails you totally.   If you are single and pre-existed, if you don't work for a big company, you, too, are SOL.  The \"welfare\" plans the states offer are very inadequate and, thanks to the AMAs deliterious influence on this entire matter, doctors will not accept most state insurance/federal welfare.  For this reason, those people end up going to the ER wicked sick or they go to a clinic where most of the doctors are students. In long, our system SUCKS!  Many, many, many people stay at their jobs here because if they leave, they will have no healthcare.  COBRA was helpful but the costs are prohibitive ($400+ is single, up to $1K+ if w/ a family).  In any case, the \"lock\" smart people fall into in having to stay with big companies is atrocious and does not engender free enterprise.  Quite frankly, and this is another conversation entirely but, I believe the AMAs tinkering in this matter has, at least in part, caused our current economic malaise as some very talented and bright people, who would otherwise be entrepreneurial, are locked into dead head jobs at big companies because they need their healthcare for their families.  It is a travesty.   More to come!!!!!! ",

      "Content": "Jul 13, 2012 08:58PM 1WonderWoman wrote: Good evening, warrirors! Had my pre-surgery appt today and they said I am ready to go! Yay!! Finally! Tex: 9 miles is pretty darn good! I bet you could still ride that. Give yourself some credit as you are back on that luscious chemo that gives the body pause. In a few more months you will get your fitness back. Every now and again I find myself in my hometown and I remember my friend and I walking everywhere and riding our bikes inordinate distances! My father always took us wherever we needed to go at night but during the day, and in the summer, she and I would put some mileage on! Oh, Timothea, I totally about the duck/owl thing! I didn't really even look at it! All I could think, however, as I marched around Walmart, is that very pic had to be on a tshirt or 2 I saw that night! OMG..that Walmart I was in was found to have \"hidden cameras\" (placed by some whacko that) in the ladies dressing rooms! So gross. Of course, I would not be using any dressing rooms in there but that little story was on the news last night!  Some guy was being asked by the news to offer his opinion and he said something like \"wow, that person must be desperate ...what did he think he was going to see in a Walmart dressing room!?\"  Such a jerk....not everyone wants to see super models!   Calamtykel: while at the hospital today I stopped about my LE sleeve. I don't have it but my onc said it is not a bad idea to just fly with it as a preemptive measure and I am fine with that. I actually that is smart. In any case, as soon as the woman in the store learned I was going to be having drains again, she came around the other side of the area where the cash register was to \"talk\" to me about ordering camisoles with the pockets built in! I already have like 8 of them but still! They are wicked expensive and I do believe there is at least some profit being made as well! Call me suspicious! I AM SO EXCITED you went running!!!!!! That is great news! I am so happy for you. I know it is just awful to work yourself into such a physically fit state and then have an issue occur. I don't even know if this would help but when I taught step aerobics one foot would give me problems and I used some tape that looked like my brother's old hockey tape so I could get through my workouts. Do whatever you have to but definitely just do it!!! Good, so I hope you, too, are going to do the Revlon Run with us in May! That is awful about the scans. There is going to be a lot of \"growing\" pains while they roll us toward socialized medicine. This kind of stuff, unfortunately, is probably going to be going on for the next 25 years as insurance companies fight for their profit margins. Like I said, it might not be in our lifetime but hopefully your kids will enjoy healthcare that they don't have to go to a job to be sure they keep. Sptmm: I think a \"Wonder Bra\" would work great for you, speaking of bras. They have these little pockets inside to accommodate these little \"eye\" shaped pads that are designed to create cleavage! It is such a joke as these things are pretty thin. I was just thinking, if you used both of those little pads in the one side where needed, it just might work pretty well for you. Just a thought. Deb, I am positive little Tex is going to smoke us in that run!!!! We still, however, have the power of the \"finger wag\" and we can toss around the old \"respect your elders\" adage! That will show her! The MRI was denied? That is as bad as what Kel is talking about with scans. If they are not going to cover your \"detection\" services then definitely go bmx. When you talk to the plastic, seriously consider a flap. There are all kinds of flaps. You are working out now and I am a bit of a Tomboy and all I could see is me bursting one and having to go in and keep getting them replaced! Something to think about. The flaps are a great solution. As for the iron, coffee and tea between meals, fruits and red meat will all reduce iron absorption. It is entirely feasible it is all connected to nutrition. Also, as for tumor markers, so many say they can just drive you crazy, chasing down ghosts. They are good in some ways but can be misleading. Something else few people know: frozen vegetables contain as much iron as fresh. I am sure you are going to be fine w/the GI stuff but definitely would strongly consider bmx on the other issue. As for your bmx questions, it was a long surgery but for you, probably only 4 hours or so b/c you are already basically down 1. If you do immediate recon the time goes up by 3 or 4 hours. Relative to being out of work, if you do immediate it could be 3-4 weeks or so. I would say you should do immediate recon b/c the way this insurance stuff is going, who knows? I would get it all done in one fell swoop. I think it is absolutely the antithesis of nuts to go through this now. Be smart, just get it over with. Again, I draw your attention to the suddenly precarious nature of what we might expect from insurance companies. And, yes you will be ready for that Revlon in May, bmx or not! Don't forget also, on the anemia, almost all people w/cancer develop mild anemia after chemo and roughly 80% experience more serious anemia. I am sure you are going to be fine on that one. I spoke to the nicest woman in pre-surgery today and we discussed the merits of a \"bosu\" ball. That is wonderful device and everyone should have one, and use it!, as it helps use increase balance. Well, I hope everyone has a nice weekend!  I feel like I am forgetting to tell you all something....perhaps it will come back to me!  Happy trails, girls!",

It is going to be wicked hot in CT today, near 100 and humidity is not too far behind, so the news people are wallowing in hyperbolic speech reminding us all we are most likely going to perish today!!!! It is entertaining to hear all their warnings...like we are freakin' simpletons! Tex: I would be curious to know what your PET numbers were. Oh, yes, certainly the hearing aids will be next! Well that sand art sounded like just a fun project! Bet the kids loved it! At their age I was enthralled with melting my Crayolas by leaving them in their hard plastic case, in the sun, and then making art from the result!!! Basically I ended up w/1 big, fat, multi-colored crayon and my mother explaining she was not going to keep buying me crayons every week!!! He he he! Rachel: glad you had a good vacation! As for Americans being against Obamacare, the \"healthy\" Americans ie: those that have not yet had catastrophic health event are against Obamacare. What they don't realize is we have \"healthycare\" in this country and not health care. As soon as you get sick, you are marked. If you met one person who said \"yes, I had a triple bypass/cancer etc... and I love the fact that I am now pre-existed everywhere, I can't buy insurance in the open market (thereby am uninsurable except through employer or marriage), I am not poor enough to be on welfare (insurance), and now I can't leave my job/wife/husband because I could never get benefits again unless I leave one job/wife/husband and get another job/wife/husband right away!!!\"then I would tell you the power of the local crop in Jamaica has gotten much, much more potent over the years!!!! Fifty-three (53) percent of Americans are single. For those people, the only place they have benefits is either a policy they purchased (when/if they were healthy) or through an employer. What happens if they experience catastrophic health event, if they were lucky enough to work for a large employer with solid benefits and they also purchased long-term disability while they were working, they will have benefits for period certain but then are absolutely relegated to only being able to get \"usable\" benefits through employment or marriage. The reason you don't hear too much squawking on these boards is bc affects women 50 and older more than women 50 and younger. Women 50 and older are most likely married and are living off their husband's benefits while they go through this battle. It is now the under 45 demographic that contains a lot of single people and therein lies the issue w/pre-existing etc... One thing to know about single people: they just don't want to be tied down/to anything at all. For this reason Obamacare offers an option, perhaps not ideal, but an option to survive and live free or die (thanks New Hampshire)!! My friend had a neighbor going through a cancer battle who lost his house, money etc... all to the healthcare system. He actually ended up homeless at 48 years old. Our healthcare system is a vacuum sucking up all the dollars of the sick meanwhile luring the healthy into a very, very false sense of security. Some lessons will perennially have to be learned the very hard way. Obamacare is not perfect nor will it be for many moons but it is a step in the right direction and guess what? This big fight and all this resistance is not because no one is making money!!! Don't forget wherever there is a big fight, a fat propaganda machine and strong opinions, there is a lot of money at stake. Plus Obama is not just arbitrarily pouring enormous energy into something that is unnecessary! Clearly the man knows there are some huge problems and that we can no longer go on with a \"healthy care only\" system. He knows what we have is a mess. Rachel, over the course of several months I will bring you up to speed on our pathetic healthcare system that ties us to our employers for life!!!! Literally for life!!!! That is exactly what I refer to as \"sucking the corporate umbilical cord!\" We literally need our jobs, which is how we get healthcare, to survive! Guess what? When you get sick, the jobs dump you. Therein lies the issue with our healthcare. Most people don't complain because they feel if they don't say anything and they stay nice and quiet, sequestered in their falsely safe corner, they will never have to burn through assets saving their life. I hope they are right!!!! But we know they are wrong. Does anyone else think Hoda and Kathy Lee start drinking(alcohol) at 6AM?!  Occassionally I watch them just for entertainment! I think their BAL is rarely below 2.0!     That is all, that is all...going outside to melt!!!!",

Rachel: oh boy, your poor sister.   A girl Maureen I used to work out with all the time and would see almost exclusively at the gym revealed to me one day she and her mom and sis had both died from bc and she had a prophylactic bmx as a result.  She was hysterical one day in the locker room as I remarked how her breasts, as she is 7 years older than I, had a life of their own, in a t-shirt, with no sports bra on!!  Who knew?! More to this point, Maureen was petrified b/c of what her mom and sis went through so I guess all I can say is the fact that you have had 2 battles with cancer, your sister must be particularly worried.  It does not run down family lines, though, unless you are BRCA and even then, being BRCA positive does not mean the women in the family will get it.  I will certainly be thinking of her and holding her in positive thoughts.  I wish you speedy recovery with your ankle and that everything goes well with your sister. I am officially being entered in the very dubious HALL OF SHAME!!!!  I, sad to say, am going to have to repeat week 2 of the Couch for the THIRD time!!!!  I can't get my times right and week 3 is 90 running and 60 recovery so I refuse to move on until I am very comfortable with week 2!!  I don't know why I am doing this anyway as I am going to have to give it up for 8 weeks after surgery!  I guess it is keeping my mind busy...that and studying for the LSATs!!!!!   Happy trails, girls- ",

Sorry I have been sparse but this time I do believe that are close to accurate when they say 6-8 weeks to recover. Wowie...I am sore and I love to nap! The ACS finally came through!  Actually I had to go to an appt and for the first time in my life, I am listening to the docs!  I decided to accept a ride with \"Road to Recovery\" as the VNA helped me get hooked up with it.  In any case, the driver was so dark and miserable and sadly she spent quite a few minutes introducing me to her rather macabre notion that cancer is here to \"weed us out\" as there are far too many of us on the planet!!!!!!  Really? Did I have to get \"this\" driver?!  I was just flabbergasted. Rachel: I hope you are having a nice, relaxing weekend. Sometimes I just think you need some peace of mind, some relaxation to get your bearings. You are a 2 time cancer survivor therefore each appt is going to rock you a bit. It is feasible they want to talk to you about the blood results to start to discuss baseline. What did they test you for? I know that is the million dollar question as most of us don't know what blood tests they are running. I can't believe they told you they could not discuss anything over the phone...great. As for texting docs, I have never. I email my GP but I have been his patient for many, many moons. I think docs getting involved in texting could be cavalier especially in our terribly litigious society. I have not heard much about that at all. I just hope you were able to get some rest this weekend. Best of luck Monday. You need to ask the doc if there is some way you can get info sooner than an appt going forward as this waiting is a total drain. It would be helpful if there was something else besides waiting for the appt.  It is just too scary...tell them. Ginger: the thing with the path results is I got the impression he had not seen them. We both got off track and then I failed to ask again. I had friends with me and I just don't think I wanted to deal with it. I will get the results this week. Meanwhile, and this was going on before surgery, I cannot straighten my left arm and my wrist is killing me. I mean I am in real pain. This is ridiculous. I feel like I have been hit by a damn truck. Thanks for alerting us about the Stage IV thread topic. If I am feeling up to it I will get over there in the next few days. Calamtykel: very happy your markers were normal.  Great news.  Sptmm: You are like some magic dynamo, woman!!! Heading off to run a 5K in the rain!!! I love it! Good for you and good for the people you are running for. Unfortunately this surgery has relegated me to being tired from a trip to the store! This one has taken a lot out of me.  As a result, I live vicariously, and thereby joyously, through you!  Tex: that is fantastic the nurse gave you their cell number. That was very nice. Nice to know there are still nurses who are not just paycheck collectors. Based on the way you are feeling, I could have slept the whole day. I can't believe you had to go to bowling today when obviously you could use some rest. I hope you are able to rest up tomorrow and feel better soon. Please be careful with the word \"nap\" as I am seemingly narcoleptic as a result of this surgery! The very reading of the word might send me into a mini session!  Well, I wish I could lift but I know I can't do anything for another 3-4 weeks. Tired again...big surprise! I hope everyone is having a nice weekend-",

      "Content": "Aug 30, 2012 05:30AM - edited Sep 9, 2012 01:18PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors- I am tired as per usual! Nothing new to report. Still wicked wiped out. It is upper 70s and dry today so I was able to bear wearing long pants when I went out today so as to hide my lovely drain that is strapped to my calf! It was nice not to have people staring at my damn drain bag! Felisaragland42: hello and so sorry you are eligible to be here with us! It is a great site filled with women who are supportive to one another through this arduous battle. Our thread, however, is 2 years old. The link for the August chemo group is: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/790539?page=14#post_3182928 This is not to say you are not welcome to post here. I just want you to be on a thread where you are getting maximum support and where everyone is having the same experience as you, concurrently. Best of luck to you. Sweeney: what is shakin' w/your bone scan results?!  I hope all is well.  Please keep us posted and even though you fired up your propoganda machine and photoshopped that pic of my boy Kim Jong, I am all forgiving and want us to move forward in our spirited and mutual fight against bc!!!!  Poor, poor Kim Jong...so maligned via HuffPost!  Mommichelle: so sorry I forgot you had a flap also. Funny story about my new boobs that I now refer to as \"Chia boobs!\" I went to the store today and a woman that works there is familiar with my situation. She has always had a joke and a smile; she is just a really nice person. She said to me today \"hey smiles, how is it going?\" although she kept looking at me trying to figure out what had happened. I told her the girls were back via a ch-ch-ch-chia event! She was hysterical.  What's more is just looking down...I feel like it is pre-bc again! That is amazing. I am happy you got it done and feel good, and normal, getting in that bathing suit or throwing on a tank top!  YAY! Speaking of recovery, Monday was 4 weeks since surgery and today I went to the grocery store and post office and am wiped out! I feel so pathetic. Just pathetic! Although, and this is for you SPTMM (!), it is all worth it. I can see the light, I can see a semblance of a life coming back together. You might be tired but with our commitment to working out, you should be able to regenerate some reserves through activity. You also get to run the 10K before surgery which is wonderful as it might be a little bit before you are ready for another one!  Sptmm: one more thing: tie a pillow to the back of your head as you never know when an impromptu nap will wash over you! On that note, all I can say is rats as, because the VNA will be rolling up momentarily, I have no time for a nap! Don't forget: There is a Rock The Ribbon event in Philly on 10/26.  For those of us in the Northeast, might be worth looking into.  They are advertising it on the landing page for this site.    Good day, all- ",

Just in looking at 10 events and their average fiscal results, I found that over the course of one year, approximately 5 million was raised. That number is huge. Can you imagine what it translates to nationally? They are making so much money off of fear with this disease there is little incentive to cough up a cure! Omaz-the muscle relaxers made it worse! What a night I had but doing a bit better today. It has been totally exacerbated by the seromas, the belly drain and my inability to do stretches and to work my abs. I am a train wreck! Thank you for your well wishes just the same!! Sweeney: when do you find out more about the bone scan and what are they doing next? Please keep us posted. Felisa: nail problems are very common w/bc chemo esp the taxanes and doxorubicin. There are some things you can do: when washing dishes, use rubber gloves. When you go to chemo, ask for 2 bowls of ice and some rubber gloves and immerse your fingertips in the ice (cryotherapy). Avoid getting manicures and your nails done until chemo is over. Wear clear nail polish and monitor your cuticles. If the cuticles get overgrown, don't pull them off but gently use a cuticle remover tool. A woman I met after chemo told me she had a lot of nail problems. She said she would do the ice during chemo *and* when she went home she would also do frozen bags of veg on her hands for 20 minutes at a time for about 3 or 4 times. The idea behind cryotherapy is when your fingertips are cold the chemo will not reach the nails that easily and therefore can't cause cell damage. I had slight nail problems during chemo but not to the extent you seem to be having. The above advice is really that of us bc girls collectively (and our experience) and they might help but as a whole, there have not been studies indicating any of this helps! We can only try! We are all scared the cancer will come back. That is a very, very natural part of this process. I would safely assume 100% of us live with that fear to one extent or another. The good news is when chemo and rads are over, and you start to feel stronger again, you don't fear it so much. Right now it is very much front-and-center for you so it is understandable you are having these fears in perhaps a more pronounced way than you might say 6 months down the road. Hang in there, it will only get better once chemo is over ;) I hope everyone has had a nice day. It is in the 60s here today...Fall is arriving!",

      "Content": "Oct 18, 2012 12:48PM - edited Oct 18, 2012 12:50PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! This morning I am plagued with \u201cshotgun\u201d sneezing!   A good 7 or 8 in a row! Sptmm: a 10K?!?!?!?   Holy smokes!!!  You are my new hero, lady!   Good for you!  That is amazing.  Enjoy, it might be a few weeks before you can do your next one!   Don\u2019t worry about that surgery at all.  You are in great shape and ready to go.   You are making the right choice and you will be happy with your results.  The best part is it the fact it is your own body fat.  They really feel natural.  Every now and again they get in the way but by and large I have gotten quite used to them! To answer your question, they are fine.  Completely fine.  They feel like breasts, soft and warm, and they are really just great.  I am very happy with the results and am glad I did it.  More to this point, NO NECROSIS!  I was petrified about that but it is all good, my friend ;) I am glad you made the follow-up post about realizing Tex had posted!  I do that sometimes, though.  I just figured she must be really nervous!! Rachel: things have changed a lot because when my brother played pee wee, there was checking.   \u201cHitting\u201d and \u201chockey\u201d are rather synonymous and it seems antithetical that it is being introduced in a \u201ccontrolled\u201d manner.   Sometimes they check to avoid falling etc\u2026   It just seems to remove the naturalness from the game to regulate the very essence of it.  It would be like controlling sliding into bases in baseball. You are so lucky to have such good healthcare!  Seriously-a myopic view into our healthcare again.  Effin chemo left me, too, with hiding veins.  They have to stick me 6 or 7 times to get a vein.  NEVER did anyone mention the \u201cpediatric\u201d team but crap, that does make a whole lot of sense!   It got so bad for me about not wanting to be pricked 7 times to get a vein that recently I told them regarding the drain in my stomach, that I did not want any anesthesia so in this way I could avoid being stuck 6 or 7 times because they would not be giving me an IV.  I opted for the pain of the procedure over the pain of being attacked with needle pricks.  Seriously, again, this pediatric business was never mentioned and btw, this was \u201cin\u201d the hospital.  Most of the time they can get a vein on me but b/c I could not lift over all these past weeks and because of the no-eating/drinking after midnight business every time I go, of course now I am partially dehydrated and I am a hard stick anyway.    I am looking forward to hearing your WW updates!  Good for you for taking the initiative.   Oh, on that note, I follow this \u201cfact\u201d thing on Twitter and the other night they sent out a tweet that said you have to walk the length of an ENTIRE FOOTBALL FIELD to burn off 1 (ONE) M&M!!!!  How awful is that?! Iowa: good for you for getting over on the damn system!!!!!  Mo money, mo money for YOU! Gadzooks, do they think we are hiding money in our ass?! Would they not have seen it on a scan and summarily removed it and tossed it into the big cancer fireplace anyway?!?!   What is even more enthralling about your story is the fact that the other place you went to with the copay was \u201cwelcoming\u201d of you coming back there.  Good for you! Thanks for posting that story also as it reminds all of us to make a few phone calls before dumping more cash. There is a hiking group I have belonged to for years and the members are pretty steady but over these past few years, obviously, I have not been around.  They have kept in touch and I just backed away, and in a rather circumspect manner, I just said I had a health issue.  In any case, I am looking so forward to getting back to going!  I just actually started looking at the emails of all the fun events and am thinking maybe, just maybe, I am getting closer to seeing them again! Good day, girls!",

Texas: I know tomorrow is the biopsy so I want to wish you well and be sure to keep us posted when you get the results. I sure hope you don't have to wait long. Iowa: now that you mention it, I will have to look again.  The subtleties I would pick up if we were closer rather than just cyber friends ;)  I know what you mean, though.  It is almost like you are too afraid to feel good, to feel spirited, to feel joy like if you do, the wrath of bc will turn on your or something.  This disease is very difficult to deal with and constantly leaves you wondering where that proverbial other dropping shoe is.  Glad you got to go into to Rocky Mountain National Park.  The photos reflect the beauty.  You live in a really nice part of the country and also people are nicer.   My good friend Cindy lives in Iowa City.  She was in CT for work for about 6 years and could not wait to go home!  It is a nice area of the country.  I have a picture of the acres sitting on Cindy\u2019s porch during sunset.  It is a beautiful pic. There is something about witnessing true beauty that takes your breath away while at the same time reminding us there is something out there greater than us.  I really feel for you, too, with your daughter-in-law\u2019s mom.  It is so hard to see someone else dying of this disease that for all intents and purposes, you seem to have beaten.  I just found out from a woman I used to work with her brother has bone cancer.  Cancer is just ubiquitous and unfortunate at that. I, too, am going to watch Parenthood next week.  I like the fact they seem to be realistically dealing with bc.  Rachel: I was really relieved to hear she came out of surgery just fine.  That is a long, long operation. I was invited to speak at a bc awareness month event. I did accept and spoke tonight.  The title of my speech was \u201chomonyms\u201d and I focused mostly on \u201cpeace\u201d and \u201cpiece.\u201d   Of course that bc once attempted to take a piece of me but now I have made peace with bc.  Sadly I did get choked up at the end and started crying a bit.  I don\u2019t think there was a dry eye in the house!  Public speaking, making speeches and writing speeches comes easy to me; in fact, I enjoy it.  It was a good event but I stayed not too long after my speech was done.  I just felt like I might start crying again!  I don\u2019t know if it is because I am so grateful for having made it this far/long and also, like you said about our nervous grin Iowa, that I sort of feel like in a total state of suspension.  Looking at the sea of scarves and wigs was a reminder also.  It is a hard disease to live with.  Constantly looking over your shoulder.  On my way home stopped at Walmart to get, you guessed it: FLASHLIGHTS!  I don\u2019t know what I did with all of mine. In any case, it looks like we are going to take a direct hit on the hurricane.  Tonight, because I appeared at the event, I actually flat ironed my hair (cannot believe how long it is), had make-up on, dressed appropriately (instead of my uniform of Levi\u2019s and a Yankee baseball hat!!) and for the first time in a long, long time I actually felt human and almost felt a trace of my old self.  In any case, of course I bump into someone I used to know.  She and her dh are remarking how good I look and like championing me as the slayer of bc.  Most people just don\u2019t get it and I have accepted that.  They look at you like you are ok because they are all \u201ceye\u201d doctors!   If they can\u2019t see it, you are good!  I will never again go to Walmart at a \u201cpeak\u201d hour! Hope everyone has a lovely evening-",

Sptmm: they call those \u201clove handles\u201d at the end of your incision \u201cdog ears!\u201d   When they *complete* the process they invariably use that area.  I don\u2019t have anything on the side but I really believe you are concerned with something that will go down in time.  The swelling from a surgery like this can take upwards of 6-8 months to fully go down.  That is great that you are walking!  Good for you!  Such nice weather for the next few days also. I am so happy you are happy with your results ;)  Certainly better than the mangled 1.5 but also gives you a new lease on life, mentally, that you did not have before.  Since surgery I think I actually forget about bc a little bit b/c they are back!  BTW, thank you also for weighing in on the hot flash issue.  I just could not help but think they might get better but there I am, standing with the freezer door open at the grocery store! Omaz: The math, the math, oy vey the math!!!!!  Wow!!!  That is a lot of hot flashes, woman!  I guess I am a baby now that I read what you go through!  I don\u2019t think I have them hourly but they are definitely there.  I think mine are more like Deb LI than what you are going through.  I am starting to quietly lament my complaining!  Felisa: Omaz is right, you are definitely a member of our group, girl!!! This means we all care about you and are here for you, through thick and thin, as we meander through this madness together!  I am glad you are feeling a little better.  That was great that your iron is good.  We have to relish every little bit of good news!!!!  Hope you continue to feel better and better with each passing day.  You are probably going to feel quite strong going into your 2nd to last chemo after Thanksgiving.  For this reason, you will most likely do better the next time.  Almost there so hang in there!  Stay strong ;) Tex: how are you feeling today?  I know you are probably busy with the kids but please keep us posted on how you are doing.  Also I hope those meds arrive on Monday.  I am going to be pretty upset otherwise ;)   Deb is right about NYC and the cost of living but don\u2019t forget, you also make more money.  The NYPD benefits are 2nd to none.   I would love for you to live in this part of the country with all those good care we get.  All things to consider but the money is definitely there to be made.   People in NY may complain about a lot of things but money is usually not one of them!  Cost of living, yeah, but inability to meet those costs through normal applied effort, no!!! Ginger: I saw the most beautiful standard poodle today and thought of you ;)  It was so cute.  Of course it wanted to attack me with love as all animals do.  I think I should have been an anthropologist studying captive animals.  There is so much we don\u2019t know.  More to this point, this poodle today seemed intelligent beyond its fur!!! Back to that tree!!  Actually I am going to cut a pineapple and then go back to my tree work!!! Hope you all are having a nice Saturday and may the road rise to meet you and the wind be at your back\u2026 all of us bc girls need to memorize that poem!!",

Finally people have gotten smart: instead of waiting for the Red Cross to organize volunteers etc... local folks in Fairfield made an announcement last night on the news that anyone who could help to just head to Jennings Beach.  That is smart.  SI, Queens and NJ have organized crews through Twitter.  Just telling people to come and bring their 2 hands to help.  ACR complicates matters.  I love Twitter!  No complications, very simple = \"can you make it to SI on such and such a date and time to help w/clean up? Fine, show up!\"  Much, much better (Ginger, this one was for you!)   Rachel: I hope you feel much better very soon as I know you are flying again tomorrow.  I feel for you.  What is nice about a thread like this is people from all over the continent are agreeing there is something going around so you know it is a fleeting situation!  BTW, speaking of sports cards, there was a guy interviewed on SI who lost some very valuable cards in the devastation.  If the boys have cards, I would get water and fire-proof safes for them for Xmas.  We never thought we could experience such weather madness in the Northeast but we did.  Not that they would ever want to sell but perhaps they would want to pass them on to their kids. Sptmm: I meant to tell you yesterday I totally agree about flying.  That air is just disgusting and for this reason, I try to avoid!  In fact, my grandmother used to like to take the Blue Nose to Nova Scotia.  It was one of her favorite trips.  In any case, I looked into it and I think you might remember around the time I was dxd I was planning to go to Ireland. Well, between 9-11 and germs, I don't love flying.  I started to investigate going to Nova Scotia and then I remembered there is a cruise out of Nova to Ireland!  I am honestly thinking of cruising to Ireland when I go.  Of course today I have no clue when that will be but I am happy about finding something besides flying...even though I will probably end up doing just that! Tex: now if this was the 70s, your kids would have already ripped into a box of Cap'n Crunchberries!!!  I hope they settled on cereal.  I give you so much credit but what I would prefer to give you is rest!  In a parallel universe I would morph you to my house where you could sleep, rest, watch tv, take long baths in total peace and quiet and never be interrupted by anything and I would morph myself to your place and watch your kids for a week!  Mind you, a few months back I was holding my nephew's baby and he remarked to my sister (as he was about to go outside) \"watch the baby with the baby!!!!!\"  Yes, my smart ass (he really is wicked smart!), adorable, 22 y/o nephew is all grown up, has kids of his own and b/c I don't have kids, he is not sure I can handle his!! PUNKS!  Rest assured, with the amount of kids in this family and the amount of babysitting I have done, and aside from my nephew's unnecessary judgement of my skills(!),I am perfectly capable of watching kids for a few days!  Felisa: you sound good today ;)  I am glad you are doing ok and feeling better.   It is beautiful here today!  Time for the Three Tenors and some fresh air!  Good day, girls-",

It is so weird that you all are talking about girls and weight lifting.  In the late 80s, we could \u201cwalk through\u201d the boys palatial gym, replete with tons of weight lifting equipment, en route the softball field!  All I wanted to do was lift!  I remember gazing longingly at the equipment and a few times I decided I would lift much to the chagrin of my PE teacher!  In any case, blocking us from weight lifting caused me to eschew sewing and cooking classes because I did not understand the gender imbalance.   In any case, here I am, some 25 years later, wondering about where that old sewing machine has gone!  It all comes full circle! Felis: glad you are enjoying your dgb and dd!  It is good for the soul ;)   As for the node removal, that fluid building could be lymphedema (LE).  I am glad you have an appointment.  I could also be entirely wrong and it is something else all together!   In any case, the 27th will get you through the holiday and then you can deal with this business after that!  I am sure your questions will be answered then. Omaz: I was in a store last night when your post hit my phone and I LOL at the \u201cthespian\u201d reference!  When I was young I worked in theater and the first time someone used that word with me I was all of 17 and the look on my face said it all!!!!  The woman was so concerned about my misunderstanding she sat me down!  It was the first time I had ever heard that word! That is just so cool that she took weight lifting.  I mean A) it is a damn good reason to get closer to the boys we all normally want to be closer to at that age (footballers!) and B) it is good for their bones.  I am so happy she took lifting.  I bet the stories were good! I did get the tree up and visitors have remarked how lovely it is and how they feel the spirit of the season upon them when here!  This feeling, of course, changes when I usher them out the door when the visit is OVER! Wrapped and ready?  No, I am all about December when it comes to that stuff!  At one time I was better but not these days.  I was, however, never as good as you!  You must have some will!  My mother would get so excited sometimes I remember her giving us gifts she knew we were dying for before Christmas!  There is nothing like opening gifts!  That is funny that it is a surprise to you as well due to your early shopping!   Adey: very excited both your girls weight lifted also!  That is so great.  I really did not know they offered it to girls.  Tex: that is so cool that you do a party for the kids where they can win prizes!!  That is great!    When you are a kid, no matter what the gift is, it is like gold!  That is so cool.  I hope you are feeling ok today.  I know, rough times.  Perhaps the kids being home next week will keep your mind busy and your spirits high ;)   Kids are fun to have around and very distracting!  I just hope you feel a little better so as to match their boundless energy!    I want to publicly say YOU ARE AWESOME!  You are my hero, girl!  And with that I drop the gavel on the Mutual Admiration Society meeting!  Adjourned!! Ginger: I saw a bunch of boxes of the nitrile gloves at a drop-off spot and thought of you!  I think after your story I will forever connect you with nitrile gloves!!!   BTW, also thought of you yesterday as a woman was driving around in her Audi TT, hat and gloves on with her Standard Poodle!!!  That car does not match the size of that dog and it was a very funny site!  There was something I heard about some bc news and it evades me now.  I will be back (please use your Schwarzenegger voice!)

Ability to breathe!!  You poor thing, what you have been through.   I think you are an absolutely remarkable human being.  With your attitude and optimism, you will be making 60! Speaking of eating and cancer, the more I study Chinese people and their low cancer rates, I found in rural areas where modern med is virtually non-existent, when they \u201csuspect\u201d cancer might be present they FAST.  They stop eating.  Cancer can\u2019t grow without fuel.  Of course, this is a very back woods approach to cancer but banal as it is, it is also indicative of an incredible level of understanding on the part of people who have no access to a MSK or DF etc\u2026 With the meat post, the implication is that all cows and pigs look sick but when I drove by a farm not far from my house where they have cows, I do not think they look sick!  I think they are cute!  I don\u2019t think pigs look sick either!  It was just a funny post I wanted to share.  It was so odd to read that someone thought a chicken looks \u201chealthy\u201d compared to a \u201cpig!\u201d  I could go further but\u2026! Felis: I am very glad to hear you don\u2019t have recurrence.  This is a tough disease to deal with b/c every lump from here on out, for every one of us, has a huge dose of fear with it.   I am glad you are ok.  As for the breast removal, mastectomy (mx/bmx) had a negative connotation for so many years because it was our \u201conly\u201d option and there was no reconstruction option.  My PSs at Yale did such an amazing, amazing job on my reconstruction, I cannot overstate how fortunate I am to have had them and how fortunate all of us are to have new, great options.  Lumpectomy is great to start with but if it gets complicated, or like Sptmm had a problem with insurance which led her to a bmx w/flap recon, you don\u2019t have to give up your physical identity as a woman.  You are going to be just fine no matter what happens and don\u2019t be worried about an mx and/or a prophylactic bmx.  Our lives are more important and as you know, Sptmm and I are absolutely enthralled with our results.  Hang in there, you have many options and every reason to be optimistic.  Finally, however, I am very happy your BS discussed removal b/c things can get murky if you have to go back for another lumpectomy.  In my situation, my BS was really behind me getting a lumpectomy initially b/c the biopsy indicated I was going to be a Stage 0 or 1 and by the time they were done, that was totally not the case, I had almost 3 cm of cancer cells and 3 cm of pre-cancer cells in that breast and I most likely would be dead by now if I did not get a bmx.  My feeling is it all works out but just listen to your inner voice.  It is your guiding light! I woke up in the middle of the night with a massive pain in my head.  It was like if you took ½ of your index finger and stuck it in your head, right above your ear, that is what it felt like.  The pain woke me up.  It felt like it was starting in my head and shooting out my eye!!!!   All spooky, spooky stuff!  I had to fight to keep myself calm so I could go back to sleep and I did!  I went right back to sleep! It is snowing and it is beautiful here! ",

Second, does anyone seriously feel less mentally sharp since chemo?  I am being totally serious.  I joke about my Jeopardy answers but I promise you, there are times when I know the answer but it is like I am chasing it through my mind.   I am just wondering if anyone else feels that they are a little less sharp and it does not have to be Jeopardy but whatever your Jeopardy is.  I find it frustrating. Alright, so off to scanville. First one is Monday at 11 and the other is Wednesday afternoon.  Good times!  Hoping for good news but these weird headaches where I feel like a laser cat from Saturday Night Live shooting beams out of my eyes and that which are eminating from the pain in the center of my head might not warrant great news!  We shall see.",

Omaz: hope all is well in the desert and you are having some recollection of what those pretty colored boxes, all wrapped up under the tree, are for and where they came from!!!! Felis: I have suffered thyroid problems probably my whole life but oddly enough I was dxd with a \"medicatable\" thyroid condition in 2005 and guess when my breast cancer started? You guessed it: 2005.   You have to remember cancer thrives in a body with a depressed immune system.  It is my feeling that I got bc from my thyroid problem having gone undetected.  It depressed my immune system and allowed bc to start.  Then I got on the med and perhaps it slowed it down but sure enough, 5 years later I was dxd w/bc and they said they were able to establish my bc started around 2005.  It is absolutely imperative you take that med every day.  In fact, when you say you are \"tired\" of taking your med, remember if you don't take it tired is going to be one of the first things you will feel.  I am sure Rachel will weigh in on this as she was just dxd a few months back.   With a bc dx, it is so incredibly important that you take that med, every day.  If you want some freebies from Abbott, PM me and I will send you the forms.  Please, though, you don't even need to take Synthroid as you can take the generic levothyroxine.    Google thyroid and breast cancer.  There is a lot of info but the one thing they definitely know is cancer needs a depressed immune system environ to get going and with a thyroid problem, it creates perfect conditions for cancer proliferation. You must take that pill every day, please.   This tragedy yesterday in CT has me so stunned.  Everyone keeps talking about gun control but I truly believe that is only 1 part of the problem.  When I walk in my nephew's bedroom and see him playing a video game where it looks so real with all these killings and blood and gore, I am stunned and now I can't help but think these video games are \"normalizing\" killing.  We have had 6 massive shootings in the past decade.  That is also when exponential growth of the gaming systems and the likes of Electronic Arts has taken place. I hate to point out that all of these killings are young men, dressed in black fatigues, carrying several guns.  In my high school in a bucolic CT town, we left the high school doors open starting in April on nice weather days.  They actually left the doors wide open.  I find it incomprehensible our society has fallen to such a paranoia and peril they will be locking school doors soon. I am sorry, I know there are a lot of guns on the streets but I do believe that these video games are not *causing* killings but they sure are \"normalizing\" it. We had video games when I was young but it was \"Pac Man\" and \"Frogger!!\"  Oh, yes, and I can't forget Atari \"tennis!\"  Geesh, that one would put you to sleep.  I just don't understand why there aren't more games like how to fix the human body for kids interested in medicine or fashion design games or even those based on Wall St.  You know like more career type of games.  What I hear a lot from these young men and women who are entranced by these games is they want to go into the military.  WOW...I wonder why.  I really think kids need to go outside and ride their bikes and lay off these awful games. This, of course, does not negate the fact that 20 poor little innocent children were gunned down senselessly.  Unfortunately crazy can happen anywhere and with absolutely no help at all.

There is no way there is not a connection especially when for every one girl addicted there are 3 boys addicted to video games. I am sorry, some people have a latent desire to kill and sitting around doing nothing will not make that desire go away but sitting all day *practicing* on video games that glorify killing is like getting your PhD in how to annihilate.  Counting this one yesterday and Manchester CT in 2010, there have been 18 mass killings in the past 2 decades in the *world* and 7 have been in the US.  All 7 have been in the past 12 years also.  Roughly 48% of mass killings in the past 12 years have been in the United States.  Nowhere in the world are there as many school shootings.  In fact, sadly we are #1 in that dubious category.  Yet the \u201cMonkeycage\u201d article below says US crime is going down.  So why then are our young men killing en masse? Check this article: http://www.infowars.com/40-signs-that-we-have-seriously-messed-up-the-next-generation-of-americans/ This article points out that of the 139 guns used in mass killings, more than ¾ were obtained \u201clegally.\u201d http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map Finally, this article has numbers that indicate crime is going down in the US: http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/07/21/the-declining-culture-of-guns-and-violence-in-the-united-states/ It is all just a sad state of affairs and now 20 little kids are being buried.",

Seriously, though, these kids are all afraid someone is going to kill them at school.  I live about ½ hour away from Newtown and these kids are petrified; they all know something awful has happened. Something else that is new for me: I don\u2019t really \u201cnotice\u201d kids when I am out and about, at the malls, stores etc\u2026 as I just go on about my business.  These past few days, however, I have been taking more notice, making eye contact and looking in their eyes is heartbreaking.  You can see they are a little afraid and confused.  When President Obama spoke in Newtown this week he said he once heard someone say having kids is like watching your heart walking around outside of your body.  It was something to that effect.  I just look at these poor kids, they are someone\u2019s heart, walking around stunned and scared. It is all so overwhelming. Tex: with not having kids, I can only imagine how hard it is to wean them off the tv. I watched a lot of TV and even played Zeppelin and Judas Priest records backwards with my hearing, previously untrained in recognizing the sound of Satan, geared up and ready to identify the devil! All I know is those little kids are gone and who knows what made that kid flip.  Sadly we will likely never know, all speculation. Rachel: yes, of course that was his motivator!!  Smart kid! He can save some lives and enhance his own!!  Finally, at change.org there is a petition to tear down the school permanently and establish a memorial in its place.  I am very much for that as I feel it is undoubtedly hallowed ground.  If anyone is interested, please sign.  If you can't find it on change.org, let me know via PM and I will send the link.  That school has to be torn down.  On a more positive note, a very good friend from NY who always sends me nice gifts sent me a Wii!!  I was so happy!  FedEx showed up with my nice gift today!  I was complaining about my Jeopardy chasing-answers-through-my-mind business and he said I should play it on Wii to sharpen my skills.  So excited!  I hate to say it but I also like those Dance games! Good times, good stuff!",

After that and a few other mishaps, I just stay away from allowing any monthly debiting.  I do allow Netflix and a few others on my credit card but no way, no how do I allow anyone into my bank accounts.   As for misconceptions about how you look and behave, on that note I think cancer patients are the most criticized and misunderstood.  If you look ok, you do your hair, do your make up, then in society's sick head, you are cured.  If you are happy and laugh and joke, you don't have cancer.  If you are anything but bald and puking you are in remission, don't have it or are cured!  What a paradox.  I get so tired of people and their stupid, stupid comments regarding this disease.  The only people that ever understand are those that have it. Others don't see you crying in the privacy of your home, calculating when it is coming back, where it is, will it be caught in time, when will you be leaving the planet, when will you have to go on chemo again, do you even want to go on chemo again etc... and all of the associated questions cancer patients have to deal with regularly, and in some cases daily.  Everyone has preconceived notions.  Also, and almost exclusively for these reasons, I keep the circle of people who know exactly where things are at with me and my old friend cancer to an absolute minimum.  There is no need to tell idiots anything because they misconstrue everything and start with their \"eye doctor\" assessment of how you are.  They don't even see that sometimes you being out at the grocery store and laughing and joking is a total front so that A) people that you don't know don't come to the conclusion you are sick, B) so people you do know don't avoid you b/c they are afraid of being dragged down by your cancer (the preponderance of the people who surround us), C) so you can put a better face on cancer (this is my personal favorite) and D) so you can be normal and give the perception of \"normal.\"  People have no clue what precipitates your \"front\" and how you, on some days, might have to really work to keep it.    Human beings are a shifty lot!!!   I am sorry you are going through all of this and that the gym mgr, having seen you not puking and not bald at the store and may have arrived at her own conclusions is a travesty.  We need a t-shirt that says \"I have cancer every day but cancer does not have me every day.\"   Therein lies the issue! As for the podcast, I will either PM or text you the link but would never put it on here!  You all don't get anywhere near the \"full dose\" of me and most of what is  going to be said in that podcast is NOT for the faint of ears or the easily offended!!!  Having said that I will remind you to listen at your own risk!  It is coming, however, because having this disease has fast led me to the precipice of exorcism!!!!!!   I hope you got your car situation straightened out.  It is very much just one thing after another. ",

Writing to you from Blizzardville!  Actually, last night the payloader showed up to push the snow to the end of my driveway!  Being the last house on a dead end has positives and negatives!  I made use of the time that I was trapped in my house to get some other stuff done so it was not all terrible. Sohard: good to hear from you!  You look great!  I am so glad you stopped by and I certainly hope all is well. Rachel: I am so glad your appt went well!  Good news, woman!  Bathrooms are my favorite and have spent many dollars in my day fixing them up!  They are really what sell houses so smart move for you.  Happy Valentine\u2019s to you and speaking of which, a perennial \"ex\" of mine asked me tonight where I was taking *him* for Valentine's Day to which I replied \"I will see you in hell, Tony!!!!\"  he he he!!  He is a long, long, long term ex....!  Sptmm: I did not notice there was any dilapidation in your boobs!  I thought those were post surgical but it should have dawned on me it would have to be summer, therefore pre-surgery, as you are standing outside in a tank!  Not really Novemberish!  Felis: great news!!!!!!   That is wonderful the wound vac is gone.  Perhaps that pineapple we are enjoying is really doing double duty!  It is just so nice to be free of those contraptions.   Good for you!  Ginger: that is awful that you now realize the Aromasin is directly connected to migraines.   That is just awful.  I am tired and sick for you just thinking about it.  I am curious what the Dr will suggest also. The blizzard was a disaster!  CT is not MN and we are just not equipped to handle such events.  There were funny stories like my friend who fell in the snow, could not get out of the snow and had to call 911!  There was a friend who was happy to have an \u201cactivity-free\u201d weekend; there were the \u201cplow flakes\u201d who start whining over the pressure of actually having business for a change!!  It was kind of crazy.  I have a picture from one of years my fav photographers of the 78 blizzard and people trying to get into GCT.  She died 2 ago and I was able to get this photo.  I love it.  It really captures human spirit. So, I am comfortably post-blizzard, actually got out today and it was wonderful!  Trapped for 4 days was quite enough.  I went out to shovel and listen to some music just to pass the time.   It was weird.   The trapped feeling was really unnerving.  When I left Lehman Brothers I went to work at Weatherly Securities in World Trade.  My boyfriend worked for Cantor and he was killed during 9/11 which I think I told you all.  In any case, ever since that awful ordeal, and having very clear knowledge of the stairwells and how narrow they were and the inner workings of those buildings, you never get over those feelings.  I never loved flying and am definitely worse now.  I have discovered claustrophobia exists also when I realized I just cannot do \u201cclosed\u201d MRI.  I think my neighbor said it best when we were waiving across the street, trapped  on Saturday, \u201cit is one thing to stay home by choice but totally another to know you can\u2019t leave.\u201d  The end!  Sweet dreams, girl and have some fun for yourselves! ",

I kind of still don't know why I fell but I guess I just missed the curb a bit, I guess? Tex: I hope you are doing well!  When I went for the xray to find out if my arm was indeed broken, there  was a young woman radiologic assistant and she started asking me the list of questions.  When I told her bc, she turned to look at me and remarked how she could not believe people my age, like her cousin, are being dxd.  She thought I was her cousin\u2019s age, 29, who was dxd at 26 w/inflammatory.  I told her about you and she was just stunned at how many people are being dxd and so young.  She said her cousin is doing ok today but when she found the lump, and b/c she was so young, was unable to get someone to listen to her right away and it took some complaining, as did your dx.  In any case, she worked as a radiologic technician.  I felt so bad when I heard that.  Much as we all hate those scans, xrays etc.. I often wonder about the workers and how they deal with the scariness of that exposure every day, all day, even though they scamper off to their little office behind the glass.  I have a sinking suspicion that glass is not protecting them much.  How is your niece?  I hope she is doing well and getting back to normal.  The lady from the shower whose dd got badly infected from wisdom tooth pulling I ran into a few nights ago and she said she is on the mend.  Hope the same for your niece;) Sptmm: yes, our group is definitely the place to talk about the reality of this disease.  If I was not fired from my job upon dx and did not have numerous problems and 13 surgeries in the past 3 years, perhaps my life would have returned to normal sooner!!  I am the only person, of all the working ladies here, who was fired so that kind of creates a new reality on top of now fighting a disease that was trying to kill me.   Although I must say, through all of this, one thing I do not lament is the fact that I am single!!!!!  I would have been disgusted beyond belief had I a matrimonial lummox hanging about while I battled this wicked disease!!!!!  (disclaimer: some of you have great husbands for that, you are blessed) Did they take skin from your hip to make your nipples?  I still say that those plastic surgeons I have at Yale are world-class.  The work is still unbelievable.   I just hugged a friend the other day who said \u201cwell, they are a little bigger than they used to be but they sure feel just like boobs when you hug!!\u201d  More to this point, I definitely do *not* need fillers!!  My PS did a really cool job on the nipples as she did not harvest skin from elsewhere but rather worked with skin that is right there on the breast.  It was amazing what she did; just amazing.  Are you going to get areola tattooing?  Oddly, I was talking with a \u201cvictim\u201d of the other off-prem PSs in New Haven and one nipple fell off, one of the implants is under her arm\u2026!!!!!  Horrifying story.  The best thing Yale did was get a microvascular and a very talented one at that. I am so glad you are all but done, Deb!!   Good times, good summer ahead!  I am so happy for you!  I bet you are feeling great.  I am going to PM you a trick I have learned through this process that might help you!! Iowa: I am going to do some research on that.  Mine does not use markers yet one of the onc nurses told me mets/recurrence can all be discovered through bloodwork.  Presumably they are looking any anomaly but there is a certain set of blood they take and what values are considered \u201cwarnings,\u201d I am not sure.  This is what I want to know more about as well.  I, too, have asked the question here and did not get much response so I am actually going to do more research on this soon and will post my definitive findings here!  I think everyone of us, on some level, has that question. Sue, I am so sorry to hear about the lady you know through your sister and what happened to her.  More to this point, though, it can happen very fast and from just a turn of events, things can get way out of control.  That is why I signed myself out of the main  hospital AMA in August when they were trying to keep me for an outpatient procedure b/c with 8 open holes in my body at that time, there was no way I was leaving the door open for problems.  Things can get bad fast and at that time, after just having had a 13 hour surgery and being back in with fluid building in my stomach, I was very weak and could have been overtaken by most anything at that point.   Plus putting the bag and drain in was an outpatient procedure.  Bottom line, be your own advocate and remember that things can turn very quickly.  We have to guard against travesty at all times.  My friend loves Waterloo! Sue, I sure hope the headaches and the lump on your arm are nothing at all.  Perhaps you to get your eyes checked and the lump is just an innocuous gathering of cells ;) On lipo, a friend got fat sucked out of her ass!  She was always very tiny but her mother made her crazy in that if my friend put on 3 lbs her mother was calling her fat!  Not joking, the girl was 5\u20194\u201d and about 105 her entire life but her mother was a cruel \"rhymes with witch!\"  In any case, she had those compression pants and to speak to Deb\u2019s point, yeah- she said it was painful!  All I could think at that time was what on earth do people go through all this stuff for?  I mean is there some prize I am missing?!  I mean we all do all of this b/c we kind of have to develop normalcy in our societal presence so the world at large does not know we had bc and/or lost our breasts etc\u2026 but for someone like my friend, who at 28 underwent that awful procedure, I could never understand it.  She also despised the compression garment she had to wear!  To each their own, of course. Rachel: are you back from Saturn yet?  Perhaps by way of Hong Kong?!  Speaking of space travel, that \u201cdebris\u201d that dumped itself in Russia was absolutely scary.  I hope you are having a nice weekend and enjoying life, woman! Felis: how are you?!  You must doing very well, out enjoying your newfound freedom from the madness we call bc! I am so happy for you!  Hope you are having good times, woman! Lately hot flashes have been getting worse.  I decided to revisit the list of foods that boost estrogen production so as to make sure I am not inadvertently creating a cancer garden of my body!  Well, as you all know I am a big fan of the Dr. Oz green drink.  I realized that parsley is a catalyst for estrogen production!!!!!   On that note, I offer a reminder for the ER+ ladies: Foods That Boost Estrogen Production Well, ladies, I must say I am happy you all are doing well and as most of us are coming up on 3 years since dx, I don\u2019t know about you  all but I will feel way more comfortable at the 5 year mark\u2026or less comfortable\u2026is 5 years closer to recurrence?!  Oh, this bedraggled disease, even milestones are celebrated while looking over one\u2019s shoulder/getting more scans!!!! Happy trails, ladies! ",

Girls, we are all coming up on 3 years soon!!!!!!!  Amazing!!!   This is crazy!!  Exciting and crazy!  I had to do a cancer screening questionnaire a few days ago and of course they are asking about alcohol.  Why is it fat, cigarettes and alcohol are the cause of *everything* they can\u2019t figure out?!   Yes, I used to party but not so much nowadays but I am so tired of them fishing in the wrong damn ponds all the time!  They are plowing cows and chickens full of hormones and antibiotics and then telling us we need to get max protein in.  This filling the animals up with carcinogenics is about 40 to 50 years old which just so happens to suspiciously coincide with the proliferation of the incredibly ubiquitous cancer.   I am so tired of them chasing ghosts with the never ending game of \u201cpin the tail on the cause\u201d with cigarettes, fat and drinking!!!  Can we please get another explanation?!? Happy trails, girlies!",

Sptmm: good to hear from you, girl!  I believe you are being modest and clearly they were not able to harvest \"b's\" off of your svelt figure!  Nice try!!!!!  I agree with you in some ways as there has been an upside to this entire bc experience.  I met you and all the other ladies here for starters! Speaking of the ladies here, I still wonder about Wherria.  I wonder how she is. Felisa: did you get to the doctor yet?!  Get moving, girl! Ginger: thanks for the info on sewing machines.  My friend said get a Viking used also.  I am looking around.  I just hate to invest too much until I know that I will be doing it more.  I think I will, though, because I actually want to make clothes that I may sell online.  I am no fashionista but I have a few ideas..! On the fish, I made my trek to the fish store I thought *might* have Atlantic tuna.  He said Atlantic tuna is monopolized by a handful of fishermen who then sell only to shoreline smaller shops and the price is crazy.  I thought he is crazy but in any case, he started talking about Hiroshima and nuclear waste in the waters and how it takes 100s of years for it to work its way out of the ocean etc...  I explained I was not talking 50 years ago, but rather 2, and the waste that got into the ocean from that event was enormous and in its arguably purest state.  Bottom line is, and though I am definitely not a proponent of farmed fish (and tuna cannot be farmed anyway), I would move to farmed items if I were you.  Salmon is enormously a farmed product now.  You might lack omegas but at least, in this case, with farmed fish you can somewhat count on the caliber of water in which is was bred.  All things to consider, Ginger and for people like me who are getting a little \"crazy\" about this matter, at some point Atlantic meets Pacific and that is a fact so I am not sure there is much protection or a definitive answer.  The tsunami that hit Japan was an awful natural disaster and I hate to, with my \"avoid the PacRim fish\" nonsense, even in a small way, add insult to injury.  All of us understand once you have cancer though, you do have a heightened sense of awareness about such matters. Tex: I hope you get back here in June after you move to your new house!!!!  I miss you and though we text, I miss your stories, hearing about your kids and hearing about how you are doing!!  MISS YOU!!!!!! Have a good weekend, girls!",

      "Content": "Oct 18, 2013 07:02PM - edited Oct 20, 2013 12:25PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, Warriors! Felisa: good to hear from you! I often think of you and hope your LEis responding well to treatment. Keep us posted and as for being either at the doctor's office or church, most of us are doing the same thing, to one extent or another, in our own way = thanks bc! The good and the not-so-good in bc news this week: Good (need I say this?!): Quest is starting to test for BRCA!!!!! Yay! This will increase access and drive down price. Monopolies benefit no one so yay for competition! Not so good: During this bc awareness month, I was not too happy to hear so many \"authorities\" on bc talk about women starting mammos at *50* years old. They often add if their is family history, to get mammos starting at 40. Safe to say almost every person on this thread could have perished undiagnosed if we had to wait to 50 to have mammos. I personally think the start date needs to be rolled back to 30. I am going to see if there exists a petition and if there is not, I am going to start one. Very good: we can actually purchase health insurance in the open market that is not ridiculously expensive nor tied to our jobs!! We will never be pre-existed again and we are no longer healthcare burdens to current or future employers b/c we don't *need* their health insurance!!! Recently I was approached by a CT Senator to \"tell\" my story. I did just that and explained how I was fired and how the cancer-related expenses were nothing short of onerous. I added that if we had non-employer based healthcare that I most likely would not have gotten fired. I further explained as people watch me go into a total fiscal tailspin as I shovel money into cancer's humongous mouth, that others are watching me and they become petrified to start a business or do anything that might separate them from their company-sponsored healthcare plans and now that they can get healthcare in the open market, for a reasonable price, perhaps we will start creating things in this country again and people will start businesses and create jobs again. It was great that Clinton got COBRA through but COBRA is only 18 mos and the average cost for a family of 4 is over $1000 a month. For a person looking to leave their job and start a business, they would have to immediately plan for over $1000 out-of-pocket on health care and then to hope their business is a huge success w/in 18 mos or they will end up uninsured. Of course, before the \"exchanges,\" COBRA ,and its associated costs, was a bargain compared to buying health insurance, and only if one was perfectly healthy (thus my moniker for our system of \"healthy\" care), could they even buy insurance in the open market. It is my ardent hope people feel more free as a result of this development. I can't tell you how I am literally \"giddy\" thinking of all the possibilities! Seriously, almost every day I spent in corporate America I was dreaming of blowing out of there and starting a business. I was petrified b/c of COBRA costs combined w/starting a business and this was when I *thought* I was healthy!!!!!!!!!! Now all of those wallowing in corporate jobs where they are miserable actually could go out and start a business, if they are so inspired, and get healthcare insurance. It is a new day in this country, people. In long, the good far outweighed the not-so-good! This will also be the beginning of my weekly news posting of the \"good\" and \"not-so-good\" news in bc! Have a good weekend, girls!",

      "Content": "Oct 21, 2013 03:26AM - edited Oct 21, 2013 03:29AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, Warriors! I am looking for a petition on rolling back the access-to-mammos start date to 30 years old. I am not finding anything as of yet. At some point in November I am most likely going to \u201cMoveon.org\u201d and will start a petition. This is not to say every 30 year old woman should start racing off to get mammos but I believe the \u201coption\u201d should exist. Also I am going to consult Tex to go over some terminology to compose a \u201crider\u201d on the petition regarding how to structure access for people in their 20s. I mean I just can\u2019t imagine being in my 20s and in this country, petrified of the lump in my chest and not being able to get a doctor to send me for a mammo. It is very unnerving and Tex had a fight on her hands to get to the point where they took her seriously. Women need to have access as early as 30 years old, at the very least. I will keep you all posted on the petition and if I do start it, I will let you know. Lady: guns make a girl feel better!!! Seriously, when we went to the shooting range in the city, yes, it was an adrenalin pump- that is for sure! I went upstate with a friend to go skiing and we stayed with her family. They had 25 acres and on one of the distant acres (we travelled by quad to this remote location!) there was a shooting range w/beer cans etc\u2026 set up. It was fun to shoot out there, in the winter and hearing the echo\u2026wicked cool! In any case, I pretty much nailed those beer cans!!! When my friend and I went in NY to the shooting range, they told all women to get \u201cin the moment\u201d when shooting meaning put yourself mentally where you wake up and realize you are hearing someone in your house and to \u201cget ready\u201d for what that feels like so you don\u2019t freeze. Reason being is if your mind has no recollection/point-of-reference in the heat of the moment, it will circle, searching for that information and this is where you freeze. When you go to the range mentally prepare yourself by installing in your memory a point-of-reference. It is very important. Also, overnight *do not* lock your gun in a safe!!!!! I mean, I am here in CT where they are all but trying to outlaw guns which makes them a bunch of jackasses b/c the bulk of crimes are committed w/unregistered guns, but alas I digress! My brother has been in the gun-toting south for many years as are a number of friends. In fact, around the time I was dxd a friend moved to TN. I asked her about crime after she moved and she said it was not like CT in that no one would arbitrarily walk into a convenience store and try a hold up because so many people carry guns. Bottom line: prepare yourself and be prepared overnight! I find it laughable when people leave their guns in a safe!!!!!! I know you have to be cautious if you have kids but you are not saving those kids if you have to fumble w/the code and/or keys to your safe in the event of intrusion! One more thing, Lady: if you use a shotgun and kill an intruder, the reasoning is when you were cocking the gun for additional shots, you had time to \u201cthink\u201d about what you were doing and charges could be forthcoming (sadly). With a handgun there is no \u201ctime\u201d to think in between shots. Things we need to know!!!! Congrats on the Tigers win!!!! I am here in quasi-Sox country lamenting my Yankees lack of post-season play as the Sox go to the series! I better change my tune, however, as I do go to Dana now! Rachel: so sorry to hear about your MIL. I feel really bad for your boys b/c they are so close to her. It is important to watch out for that \"quality v quantity\" line though. I feel for you all. It is so difficult. That is so great that you took time to go see grandma in England! She must have been so happy to see you! So a little good has come out of those bedraggled trips to Denmark?! There is nothing better than just seeing the eyes of loved ones you have not seen in a while. I am very happy you were able to find a little time to make her day and build a little love into your lengthy trips abroad! As you all know my parents have passed on, both quite young, and my grandparents are gone as well. I miss them all :( Ginger: best of luck with your November tests and appointments. Keep us posted. Adey: nice of you to drop by! I will check out that book and will look forward to some harassment! Well, ladies, unfortunately my broken arm never quite healed. It is clicking and it hurts. I have a series of appointments coming up to figure out what the heck they are going to do with my arm and, more importantly, to find out why it failed to heal completely on its own. November is a big Dana month for me. Hoping it is all ok. It is a beautiful day in CT and now I must go get stuff done! Happy trails, girls!",

Ginger: I spoke to Timothea last week and she is in good spirits and she seems to be tolerating txs pretty well. This is the final week for her! YAY! I will speak with her in the next few days and I will update you (all) on her progress. I will be sending you vibes and honestly, as today was a holiday, they are hopefully, hopefully just running a bit behind. Don\u2019t forget, January we start our collective \u201cto do\u201d lists and many people head out to get those \u201ctests\u201d they put off at the end of the previous year. I am very hopeful your results are just fine and that the lab is just inundated. As for me, my check-up was scheduled for this week but we are due for a foot of snow, Tuesday into Wednesday, and I was due in Boston on Weds. I had to postpone as if CT is scheduled for 12\u201d then Boston is in for as much, if not more. Secretly I am happy for a few more days of \u201cignorance is bliss!\u201d Sptmm: Deb, it is odd that your iron levels are nose diving. It is great that you know they are, however, because as I read that all I could think was I have no clue where my levels are. Your doctors sound very thorough. This is good. I am seemingly becoming resistant to going to any docs at all so perhaps this is why I don't know where my levels are!!  I think you are right in that the goal should be not to meet deductible this year! Deb, we all love a nice, new car! Especially when we don\u2019t have to pay for it! A vacation is always coveted and some other new stuff is all good! You know, Deb, the other day someone asked me how come I look so young, what is my secret etc.. and I just turned and said \u201cI laugh a lot; I think everything is funny!\u201d I seriously think that is it. Laughter so working out, laughter and, yes, a little out the nose is all good!!!! I am going to go kicking and screaming to my check-up!!! Ginger, be sure to let us know your results! Happy trails, ladies-",

Tex: how are you?  I miss you and I have been thinking of you a lot.  I am sorry but I have been busy.  I will talk to you soon! Rachel: I am so, so very sorry about your MIL.  In retrospect, I believe that we all have had it hard in one way or another with cancer.  You, however, have had your bought with ovarian and then breast (forgive me if I transposed the order) and then when your health started to strengthen and you were putting some of the more crucial points about this very arduous battle behind you, your MIL started fighting cancer, and thereby fighting for her life.  It is just so much to deal with and I know I have said this before but honestly, I really think it is me projecting my own insecurities about how I might feel if I was going through a similar situation when I marvel at all you are going through and every bit of it sponsored by cancer.  I really don't know what I would do or how I would react.  I know your boys are very close to her and this has got to be so tough on all of you.  My heart really goes out to you.  This disease is such an albatross and none of us will ever be the same.  Good or bad, no one wants cancer to the catalyst. I hope your MIL is resting and experience some of the relief palliative care can bring and that her loving family is all around, comforting her as she fights this out to the bitter end.  I really wish it did not have to be this way for your MIL, you, your dh, your boys and to everyone else's lives she has touched.  It is my hope she is not suffering.  Let us know how things are going.  Sweeney: I hope the 10th is a nice day for you, go out and make some memories ;)  Ginger: where have you gone?!  I am thinking of you this evening! Iowa: as per usual, great pics and you look fab! Ladyinbama: how are you doing?  Have not heard from you in a long, long time woman! Felisa: how are you doing? Been thinking of you also. Sptmm:  I know you ran that Revlon and I am happy for you!  A few days ago  I was telling someone about you as we sat and watched Steve Harvey who had a Chicago police officer on who was also a bc survivor.  She mentioned how she works out every day, as she is working out to save her life.  Thought of you immediately!  Adey: speaking of Chicago, how the heck are ya?!   I also like \"Chicago Fire!\" I hate cancer.  I hate what it has done to all of us and I really hate the fact that we all are so young for all of this, and of course the group's youngest, Timothea, on the front lines, fighting this bitch again.  It is still stunning to think the preponderance of us were in our 30s when dxd.  Add to that, you never feel safe again in your own skin again, ever, as you await the next physiological betrayal.  You make peace with it but it is the kind of peace you might make with the crack in the wall of a structure.   I am tired now, very tired!  Going to watch some \"Chicago PD (my new fav!)\" and go to bed! One of the reasons I posted tonight besides wanting Rachel to know I was thinking of her, was to pass on a quote that a friend is using as the signature in his emails, as follows: \u201cWhen you come to the edge of all the light you know, and are  about to step off into the darkness of the unknown, FAITH is knowing one of two  things will happen: There will be something solid to stand on or you will be  taught how to fly   As always, I wish you all the happiest of trails!!!!!!!!!  ",

I am wondering about how you are and I am sure I speak for the entire group on this.  Please check in, let us know how you are.  Sorry, time got away from me this summer. Felisa: I am really sorry to hear about you having another lump.  I was so disappointed to read that.  Make no mistakes, everyone who has ever had cancer is concerned with every lump and bump.  Last night I woke up with a bad pain in my abdomen.  It was really odd and I am sorry to report, I immediately started feeling for lumps and thought of cancer.  It is just never-ending.  I wonder if they day will come when I don't think of it so much? As for me, I refuse to get some recent testing done.  I just don't want to!  Ignorance is bliss and I am happily holding onto that! Keep me posted on how things go for you.  You can also PM me any time.  I am here, just busy these days. I hope everyone is doing well and enjoying their summer!  A little update would be nice, ladies....! Best of luck to you all-",

I know that sound so very arbitrary, but our political races in the US normally look like who is running for the most unattractive human being on the planet!!!

Kansas City V Mets, should be interesting. I thought the birds were going, though. At the very least, and year after year, they are strong contenders. Good to hear from you again. LadyInBama: I love, love, love your pic!!!!!!! Looks wonderful!! I am glad you are doing well, and, as always, it is great to hear from you as well. BRCA testing: so I had it done again because apparently the sequencing is more advanced now. I will post the findings soon. I would post more about why they did it, but I have become a wee bit more private about my cancer-related issues. In fact, I might start a website for us at some point, only for current members of this thread. This site is great, but it is really so incredibly public, almost unnervingly so. Perhaps I will send an email about BRCA explaining more of what is going on. In any event, I hope you all are having lovely Fall days! I just got back from the most wonderful walk in this crisp weather, checking out everyone's Halloween decorations, watching the plethora of squirrels scampering about, and I even saw a few cats and dogs, so overall my walk was a huge success!!",

I hope you have a nice holiday :) Felisa - I am soooo happy you have a BENIGN event!!!!!!!! Who cares those freakin' benign balls of junk rolling around our systems!

      "Content": "Nov 29, 2015 03:23AM - edited Nov 29, 2015 03:25AM by 1WonderWoman Hello, Warriors! Felisa- lymph nodes swell for a number of reasons. Of course, this always means they are fighting some type of invader, and while a lymph node will normally be about the size of a pea, a single node can swell to the size of an acorn because of the additional lymphocytes are being created. All that increased size is telling you is your body is fighting something. Take it easy, our bodies went through a lot of drama with cancer and the associated txs. Don't overthink this matter, just relax until you get some definitive results. There are numerous things that can make nodes swell, so let's just hope this is another issue. Please keep me posted, and I am here for you. This disease is like having sleeper cells in your body, in perpetuity, and you just never know when they are going to activate again. Just stay positive because I think the more drama and stress you deliver to your body, the more cancer is strengthened. Keep smiling! This is, after all, all any of us can do! Hope you had a nice holiday, and make sure you provide updates. I will be thinking of you :) Happy holiday weekend, ladies!",

I actually admitted to Deb (Long Island) that I was actually \"exit planning\" after chemo. I admitted that I really did not think I was going to make it this far, yet here we all are celebrating 6 additional years of life after dx! AH-MAZING! That is so strange about your cousin with it coming back after 2 decades, and a different kind no less. This disease is perfectly enigmatic! Sorry to hear about your back. That was one bad accident, and I guess what I am trying to say is I am glad your injuries were not worse. Best of luck with the move. Moving is such a drag, but perhaps the next will be to your somewhat-forever home?! How are your pets? Sue: I like your avatar! You look good, very Florida-esque, which I believe is where you are residing in the winter now, right? Thanks for the info on thermography, I will check into it. I have my next onc appointment in April. I am really amazed at this entire journey. I just drove by Yale (Smilow) today and I was stopped at the light, watching all the people going across the 4th-floor bridge (from the garage) to Smilow. All I could think was 1 in 5 is likely a ghost. In the minute I was at the light, I must have seen 30 people cross that bridge. I was remembering all the times I crossed it, all that chemo, going back and forth and I could not believe that I once was one of those people, crossing that bridge, wondering if I was even going to survive. What a very long, strange, beautiful, sometimes arduous, and amazing journey this has been. I am back in school to become an RN, and then I am going to law school. RN-JD is a growing field b/c of the baby boomers, the overall aging of the populace at large and the abysmal fact that roughly 75% of the country refuses to estate plan, both financially and medically. Cancer gave me the chance to go back and do what I was supposed to do, I believe, which is go to law school. Being an RN, and working as one through law school, will only serve to help what I eventually plan to do. What has cancer meant to anyone who reads this? Just wondering, and perhaps I will have 3 responses by August!!!!! Has anyone discovered even the slightest silver lining (please don't take offense)? Happy trails, ladies! All my best- Signed, Your Fearless Leader!!!",

Whole grain pasta, whole grain bread---just ditch any white-flour based items you consume, within reason, of course. I mean I don't think you have to stop it all together, but it has to be limited. Here I am always vilifying the animal-based meat processing industry, and all their nutritionally dubious injections of hormones etc... Clearly that will not help our cause, but to look at our populace, the weight problems that are plaguing the country, and the ridiculously high incidence of diabetes, coupled with the proliferation of cancer, and we are getting a much clearer picture on just what could be going on. Hope you all are well, and that you are enjoying my links! Every time I find something useful, I will post it. This is stuff we need to know. All my best-",

However, this leads me into my next question: what are symptoms?!  In the event of recurrence, how are we to even know?!  I was the only one who said I had a systemic tired washing over my body and joint aches that were outrageous pre-dx but I also had 2.5cm IDC and 3.5cm DCIS so I think I might have been a little further gone (!) than most of you.  What symptoms should we be looking for?   Itching boobs?  BMX: it was hard, at 40, with only 1 boob affected, to decide on a bmx but after going through all the stories on this site, and knowing I wanted to maximize my chances, I elected it.   I also had, not joking, insurance in the back of my mind!  I thought if I did everything I could now, they might look more kindly upon insuring me later!  It was all these \"margin\" stories that really did it for me.  In the end, I made the *correct* choice for me as they would have NEVER been able to get clean margins b/c of all the DCIS cells and they also would NOT have known they did not get clean margins.    It is not like cancer cells are rainbow colored when they cut you open, readily identifiable for removal!   Especially DCIS....sneaky stuff.  My heart goes out to those of you without clean margins as that is worse than these damn water balloons in my chest.  If I did not get clean margins and more surgery loomed, I would definitely consider mx, bmx as a future option because if they have to keep cutting, you are going to end up with damn near an mx anyway.   The other way I put this in perspective is breasts serve no purpose and are simply ornamental.  I know if my father could have gotten his lungs removed and LIVED he would have done so immediately.  I think of all the people with cancer in body parts that are NOT expendable and how hard their choices are.  For these reasons, bmx was it for me.  Best of luck to those of you all grappling with the decision...it is not easy at all.  In the end, the ladies here on this board helped me tremendously. I hope you all have a lovely day, listen to some good tunes, keep your spirits up, smile at yourself in the mirror and get ready for Thanskgiving :)",

Calamtykel: Half a tree!?!?!?   I also had to push myself to put it up but, like most things these days, I have to push myself to do everything.   It is just the way it is.  This fatigue is nothing short of alarming.   I am going to try to do a few normal workouts this week.   Fatigue gets worse if you feed it so maybe a few workouts will starve it for a while!   Who knows....I am sure I will have to nap as soon as I am done!",

I am a little nervous about this open-wound business but did I ask the important questions like about showering, stomach-sleeping, nd does itching mean it is healing etc... = NO...I forgot, of course! I guess the VNA will help me. Iowa: I say I should be done by Oct b/c my PS can't do anything with the area that was operated on for 6 months. This pushes me into June before he can do anything and step 1 will be replace the TE, step 2 (probably 1 month later) is going to be start fills and then the final step, which probably won't take place until September, is final implants. This set the timeline way back. I also have chemo yet to finish. Calamtykel: it is amazing to read the \"horror\" stories of what women went through in the 70's. My friend's mother had bc and her doc kept telling her the lumps were in her mind etc... until finally she found someone that helped her. She had a bilateral. My friend was like 11 when her mom came home from the hospital and she remembers she and her brother using her prosthetics as floatation devices in the pool and putting them on their heads etc...! Bottom line is we have come a long way and there is a sisterhood now and this board helps tremendously. Imagine what it was like to have bc and not have anyone to talk to about it NOR were you supposed to even discuss it? What an awful, lonely existence. Sweeney: that is weird that the duct tape area took longer to come back but I think your reasoning on why is spot-on. That really sucks on the eyebrows. I mean at least they are back, and apparently grew in with a vengeance, but why you lost them 2 weeks after your last tx is beyond me. It must have felt damn good to get them waxed! Sptmm: did you have chemo? I thought you did. My costs of chemo alone were $150,000. I hope we can all get to Vegas. I believe we get a group discount also. Yes, so treat yourself good and try to make it. The costs should not be that bad. Omaz: is going to Vegas! YAY! I think as many from this thread that can make it, the better. Plus I can't wait to meet so many more from this site.   Rachel: glad your hair is coming back and fast. That is great news.  Where are you vacationing at the end of hockey season?   I hope you are going somewhere warm with a slow pace ;)  Well, it is time for me to do some more relaxing....as if this is even humanly possible....",

I am concerned for you on the lump in your neck.  Don't forget, 90% of the lumps in our bodies are benign.  That is what was going through my mind when the absolutely incomprehensible words fell out of my doctor's mouth telling me I had bc.  It still all seems so odd. Texas: I LOVE Chelsea Lately!   She is crazy.  I like \"The Soup\" also.  The guy who does Soup is on \"Community\" which is a sitcom on NBC w/Chevy Chase.   It is pretty good.  So how are you feeling these days?  I hope you are doing well.  I am so glad your move is done and your computer is back up and running.  Good to have you back! Sptmm: You make a very good point in telling us what your docs said about how we are all pathing on a trajectory driving us into the future and how txs are getting better each year.  It is entirely feasible by the time we hit the 5 year mark on tamox, there could be a cure or something that puts us forever out of harm's way regarding the potential for recurrence etc....  We just don't know.  Therein lies hope.  Hope is for a better future, better txs, an end to the debilitating fear connected with this dx and long lives for us all.   We can't think about the end when there is so much living to be done.  I am very much with every one of you, however, who is feeling worn down by this entire process and who are trying to figure out what might be next.  It is only natural.  I, for one, am looking for a break from the spookiness!  Congruent with my juvenile interests, and because it is snowing yet again in CT, I am watching \"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.\"   Good stuff!  I remember being in NYC at the Palladium and Limelight at 16 and 17 years old when my father thought I was at the library and then going to a sleepover!!!  Good times but these kids in this movie are so subdued compared to me and my friends!  Then there was the never-ending concert scene of which one of my favorites was Guns N' Roses, Metallica and Ugly Kid Joe at the Meadowlands!  We rented a short bus to go so we could party on our way!  I never saw a band get hit with so many tomatoes and other assorted rotten crap than Ugly Kid Joe!  It was sad.  Guns at the Hollywood Bowl was amazing...I was 18!  I want to go back!   I never wanted to go back until bc entered my life.  Crappy bc. Sweet dreams to you all-",

Sptmm: you make some very good points especially about \"slow down\" vs. \"the end.\" It is absolutely true that all we can expect is a slow down with this process. I totally identify with you and the nothing-bad-ever-happens-to-me theory because the last time I was in the hospital I was 17 years old getting a tonsillectomy. In regards to the safety net, if you think about it, we went on for a long time thinking we had it and we did not as bc already set up camp in our bodies. If we could only recapture the confidence we had while bc was growing and we did not know we had it yet and put that to use now when, for all intents and purposes, we *are* more bc free than we were then! It is so odd how we can have such a sense of confidence when our bodies were being undermined by bc and now that we have gone through the processes of medically evicting it, we are more scared than ever!!! I wish I knew the answer! Texas: I have no appetite AND a weak stomach so I had never seen Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. By the time I read your post the toilet scene had already occurred! It was sooo gross! I could not change the channel fast enough....yuck! It would be great if your husband could get out of his line of work. Perhaps working security? A friend of mine went from local PD to state PD to working executive detail in Washington. There is a story behind the State to Washington transition but there are a lot of private security jobs. I hope he can figure out a safe segue. Your hair looks good. Just like mine. I am getting worried because I have like 2\" growing over my ears and the rest is lagging....a startlingly attractive look I might add! Bdavis: thanks for stopping by. You are correct in time will help us deal with this more in stride. When I think I have been on the planet for 40 years and had a \"girl interrupted\" moment with a bc battle that looks like it is going to take 1 ½ years to complete the largest parts of, it is really just 1 ½ years of the 40 I have been here. In time I hope I am not so anxious about it and can deal better. Ginger: I feel about my phones the way you do about your computer. I just learn it really well and it breaks, becomes obsolete and thus time for a new one. I have a netbook that is only 6 months old and is doing the blue-screen-of-death too much. Not happy! Omaz: thanks so much for the tutorial! I really appreciate it. I look at those graphs and I understand them but I don't look that often because they scare me! Especially since 1 in 7 women are being dxd w/bc, my new thing is whenever I am sitting in a group of women, I count 14 and think I am 1, who is the other. I get scared of the numbers! I really appreciate you taking the time to break that information down. It not only gives a greater understanding but also gives hope. Also, if I forgot to tell you I am jealous because A) your hair looks great and B) it looks WARM where you are! Lisasinglem: bc, or any cancer dx, I think tosses us into a negative tributary relative to expecting the worst. I think that will abate over time but with the catastrophic loss in college, something like that I just don't think goes away. It, too, lessens over time but the sting of the experience remains. I know, I lost my boyfriend and countless others in 9/11 not to mention I should be dead as I was supposed to be there that day. It is really difficult. Someday we won't expect the worst but will look forward. I think making plans and having things to look forward to is imperative at this point for us all. Plan a vaca with your husband...go somewhere great and romantic. Have things to look forward to. Elizabeth27: I am so glad everything went well. Good news! I told you....it is a walk in the park compared to chemo! IowaSue: what a traumatic experience. You were only 10 and he lived less than 1 month...geez...my heart goes out to you. That is so rough. Even though my dad died when I was 29 of lung cancer, I *never* worried about getting cancer. I guess it is just as well that I did not....why waste time worrying about things that have not happened? I hope we all find some peace with this dx over this next year. I have actually been awake, shoveling, doing dishes and cooking most of the afternoon...a big day for sleepy, indeed! Surely a nap is only minutes away! I hope you all have a good night-",

If you are taking tamoxifen to reduce the risk of breast cancer, or if your cancer is limited to the milk ducts (ductal carcinoma in situ-DCIS), then discuss the benefits and risks of taking this medication with your doctor. However, if you are taking tamoxifen to treat breast cancer, then the benefits of taking tamoxifen are greater than the risks of side effects. Seek immediate medical attention if you develop symptoms of a stroke or blood clots in the lungs/legs, such as weakness on one side of the body, slurred speech, sudden vision changes, confusion, shortness of breath, chest pain, or calf pain/swelling. Tell your doctor immediately if you develop symptoms of cancer of the uterus, such as unusual changes in your monthly period (e.g., amount or timing of bleeding), unusual vaginal discharge, or pain/pressure below your \"belly button\" (navel).",

Perhaps we have even discussed this already but I was just wondering. I am not quite sure it will rid my body of poison but I am thinking about 1 month out I might like to do a flush. There is something moderately satisfying thinking about trying to get residual junk out. To be honest, based on the caliber of \"junk\" we have received, I think my cleansing notion is ridiculous but I can dream! Why am I craving Roquefort?! Weird, weird chemo.

The snow piles at the end of my driveway are over 6' and it is a narrow entrance now...I am worried as to what is going to happen after we get our NEXT storm this coming week and what if I have an emergency! This is altogether very unsettling! Perhaps you all might see me on CNN in my Bobcat next week! Lady: while on chemo I definitely have the weird odors but during the time I was off of it, while having the infection etc... it went right back to normal. Of course it is here again now that I am back on chemo. I agree you should just be very upfront with your gyn if you have lingering odors. I forget how long it has been since your chemo ended. I am sure it is going to go away in time. Lisasinglem: What grrrreat news all around! Congratulations on getting the part, the potential for a part in the film about breast cancer, and on your 2 lb loss but the very best news, in my opinion writing from snowbound CT, is the FREE trip to Rio for a week! That is *the* best news of all! Accidentally finding a support group in your building was a nice find also. I am so happy for you and all your good news. As for muscles, many women shy away from lifting b/c it creates mass which has weight therefore their love of the scale-driven results is negated. Muscles are a jacket for bones so surely you have lost inches as you tighten up those muscles but you are adding mass, very good mass, at the same time. Do you measurements, head-to-toe, once per week to really gauge where you are at. You probably look like you lost 10. It is just about nap time for me again....later all-",

I have not heard from her since but I am only pretty sure our friend Tex is probably doing ok and enjoying the kids and having some help for a few weeks. Additionally, yesterday I felt ok so I went out and did some things. Well, last night I was up feverish and with the chills for most of the night. Because I am done with chemo, to be honest, I would prefer it be the flu than another infection! I feel ok today but a bit rundown. It felt so good yesterday to do some things and not feel winded and tired out and have to take a nap in the afternoon....I was rather hoping I could hang onto that feeling. Oh well. The weekend will tell if the fevers were due to another infection in that open wound of which I am no antibiotics for OR if it is the flu. Omaz: that was so sweet that your daughter was so helpful! I loved that story and if I was not so sick last night, I would have responded then. Ginger: I think as long as you live in Washington, I would plan to work on the Haiti project certainly in the first 2 months of the year or just get to a warmer climate. It sounds like you thrive closer to the sun! Honestly, though, and my brother lives in Houston, people all over this country are fed up with this outrageous winter we all are having. It is tough to deal with. Get with lisasinglem and head to Rio with her! Sptmm: yes, we did dodge a bullet the other day....but now tomorrow...ugh. I am having my ROOF RAKED today! I never thought I would see the day. Plus, at night I am hearing little noises which I like to think are the gutters because of all the ice but one never knows. So tired of the news regaling us with stories of the plethora of roof collapses in our area...tired of the reports of this haunting reality. Libraylil: I just got a reminder in my blackberry to order another wig from the place I got one before b/c that one is a little shabby. I dismissed the reminder and have decided no more wigs...when the weather warms up, short hair it is. I can't stand those bedraggled wigs! COMMANDO it is...good choice. Congratulations on the test run yesterday also. I am getting more used to my peach fuzz. I also think I just don't care anymore because hair is the last thing I am worried about after this bc battle.

WOOT WOOT! Good for you and very nice that you are reporting live! Iowa: it was 1 degree here last night! Hope you are warm as well. Also, nice new avatar. Ok...where are my back scratchers! My fevers last night, I think, left my back itchy. Oh well....have to get out and do a few things. Here's to hoping my fever was mild hypothermia (from heading outside in 1 degree weather with a sweat jacket) and not another infection.

Ladyinbama: I don't blame you for walking the hell out of there. Recently when I was made to wait I told the doctors office I will be sending them a bill for my time (this was not one of my cancer/bc docs btw!) and if they don't pay it, I will see them in small claims! The only one I wait for is my GP and the reason I wait is b/c I know he is super busy because he cares about his patients and he has a heart of gold. Oh yeah...and he also saved my life by (strongly) encouraging me to get the ultrasound and the mammo! Your ooph surgery is Monday at 7? Was that established recently or did I miss something? Best of luck to you. I will be thinking of you and sending happy thoughts your way on Monday morning. Also, thanks as you inadvertently reminded me on the gyn....I have to find a new one and get an appt. Oh joy...March is shaping up to be scans, port removal and doc appts. Calamtykel: I am so glad you are doing good. Take all the help on hand and make your life better. Just march on into the future knowing you did what you had to, when you had to, to make your life a lot better. Good for you! It is so good to hear that you are doing well today. I was thinking about you. Omaz: I was hoping for another DD story...what happened?! Lisasinglem: I know you just finished rads (congratulations) so I pose this question to you: did they tell you your skin, and if you had any burning etc.., would get better in time? I was just wondering. I know no one really talks about the healing expectations after radiation. Well I went for a 2nd opinion on rads and was told unequivocally I should have it and the reason I cannot is because of the open wound. Unfortunately, as you all know they like to do it right after chemo, I would not be able to get it until the end of the summer. I am going for 1 more opinion. As much as I like the RO I saw, and my onc also said her word should be the last, I cannot help but wonder why 3 other IIbs with similar tumors, placements and bmxs would be getting rads and not me. To tell you the truth, I am kind of afraid not to get it which is what caused me to go for the additional opinions. Well, and sadly, I really don't know what good it is going to do me in 6 months anyway. If I have a chance to council other women who have bc, I will definitely tell them to take the additional surgery at a later date (if they are doing mx/bmx) for recon and just deal with the mx/bmx surgery and find out after surgery if you need chemo and then go from there. I feel putting off recon until you know if you need chemo and/or rads is a much, much better choice. Oh well....and there I go Monday morning quarterbacking!!!! This evening I feel like a truck hit me and I am wiped out.  Good night all-",

In any case, hope that ooph went well. Keep us posted. Ckptry: did you ask for the echo or did they offer because herceptin might have a deleterious effect on your heart? Reason I ask is to even qualify for TAC, and I think you know this from your MSK days, one has to go for a muga scan to make sure the heart is healthy enough to tolerate TAC. At my last chemo meeting with my onc I asked about a post-chemo muga to be sure my heart was relatively unaffected by all of it and he said they usually only do a post-chemo muga if there is suspicion. I told him I want to get back into working out and if this means I have to do 1.5 hours on the treadmill at 2.0 instead of 45 minutes at 4.2 then I *need* to know this. They said they were going to set me up for a muga and apparently that has not happened yet. I made a call about it today and no one got back to me. I want my muga and if they don't order, I will find someone that will. I would think it would be protocol to have a post tx muga. In fact, from what I understood from others who had TAC, a mid-way muga was usually ordered to be sure the heart was still in the range it was upon starting. In any case, let me know if the echo was your idea or their's. As for feeling breathless, that sucks. It is probably the awful weather and perhaps an asthma flare-up but I would still mention it to your onc or GP. Check to see if a test is in order. Good luck with that. I am so glad that is over. I mean I am in now way back to pre-bc shape but my breathing is no where near as labored as it was on chemo. JSW: How are you? I hope the last chemo was uneventful and you are feeling well. Let me know how you are. Texas: where are you?! I know your company is still there but I really hope you are doing well and recovering from surgery. Stop in and let us know what is going on!

I am going to watch some Conan and then go to sleep dreaming of having my own massive, jetted tub and 2 cabana boys to do massages whenever I need! Dreams! Ugh...this chemo left me at the bar, laying on the floor, trampled! Goodnight all- You all must be resting from your superbowl festivities! Lady: I hope all went well today and we hear from you again soon. I was just talking about getting a hysterectomy today to try to get rid of the estrogen factory that I no longer need! In any case, hope that ooph went well. Keep us posted. Ckptry: did you ask for the echo or did they offer because herceptin might have a deleterious effect on your heart? Reason I ask is to even qualify for TAC, and I think you know this from your MSK days, one has to go for a muga scan to make sure the heart is healthy enough to tolerate TAC. At my last chemo meeting with my onc I asked about a post-chemo muga to be sure my heart was relatively unaffected by all of it and he said they usually only do a post-chemo muga if there is suspicion. I told him I want to get back into working out and if this means I have to do 1.5 hours on the treadmill at 2.0 instead of 45 minutes at 4.2 then I *need* to know this. They said they were going to set me up for a muga and apparently that has not happened yet. I made a call about it today and no one got back to me. I want my muga and if they don't order, I will find someone that will. I would think it would be protocol to have a post tx muga. In fact, from what I understood from others who had TAC, a mid-way muga was usually ordered to be sure the heart was still in the range it was upon starting. In any case, let me know if the echo was your idea or their's. As for feeling breathless, that sucks. It is probably the awful weather and perhaps an asthma flare-up but I would still mention it to your onc or GP. Check to see if a test is in order. Good luck with that. I am so glad that is over. I mean I am in now way back to pre-bc shape but my breathing is no where near as labored as it was on chemo. JSW: How are you? I hope the last chemo was uneventful and you are feeling well. Let me know how you are. Texas: where are you?! I know your company is still there but I really hope you are doing well and recovering from surgery. Stop in and let us know what is going on! Calamtykel: hope you are feeling well and enjoy that decaf! Sweeney: hope work is well. Rachel: I completely agree that chemo brain is alive and kicking! I can't stand having conversations where I have to recall details and I stall or the train completely goes off the tracks and I forget what the hell I was talking about!

Sptmm: on the holistic side of cancer care, when I look at the list of foods that contain B17 (the only way we can get it b/c the govt forbade healthcare providers from giving shots or supplements!) none of them are on an American's \"everyday\" list. There are some very esoteric foods, spices etc... on that list. I am going to look into it closer. On your daughter, EXCELLENT news! My bf in high school played field hockey. It is a great, fun sport. A certain amount of mental acuity is also required, much like hockey. Good for her. As for family helping out, to be honest, my friends were 100% more supportive than family through this entire bc journey. More to this point, you are not alone. It is so weird, between the economy and the general malaise that washed across the northeast with this awful weather since mid-December, a lot of people just could not get out of their own way and this might be why family was scarce. In any case, I think you and your daughter handled the entire situation with much aplomb and dignity and for that you both can be grateful for the support of each other. On the college costs, I just heard the other day Yale is up to $62K...whaaaaat?! How can that be? If I had kids I would have moved to CA when they were under 12 so all the residency could be established etc.. and they could go to community college for free. In this way you cut your 4 year bill by ½. It is such a travesty that college costs are getting so far away from residents of this country. I don't like the path this country is on nor do I like the fact that Trump is wanting to run for President and to fight with China meanwhile they buy an enormous amount of our debt in the open market every day in the form of US bonds....a bad situation indeed. In any case, I hope she gets the funding she needs to get in and I am sure glad that coach reached out to her. I am sending positive thoughts for the best results for her on this matter. BTW, thanks for the warning she just got her license!  Congrats to her and now I am going to go check that my airbags are secure and in proper working order!!!!!!  Rae786: you should have jumped in sooner, my TAC sister! Adey and I were the only ones on TAC in this group. Good luck with everyone and feel free to join in more frequently. Come one, come all! Rachel: congrats on being done! YAY! As for returning to work, only when you are ready and if traveling is not for you, make that a part of your return to work program. It is very cool that insurance companies in CA (have not heard of this in the US) work with employers to return you to work gradually. That really makes things easier. Good for you. On the degree in math, good for you! There are not enough people \"fluent\" in math let alone women so you make me very, very proud! I was never a math and science girl and the science part I blame on my uber-hot bio professor my first year in college! All I wanted to know more about was HIS body! You seem to get a lot of support at your local center. That is very cool. In fact, I think you were one of the only of us to remark about support groups, classes etc... in your area. Again, it seems a bit more comprehensive in CA with your socialized medicine....what a paradox!!! Well, I am still having light-headedness, 1 month out from chemo, when I stand up. I am drinking only water now (milk, tea, water or seltzer are the only things I drink) except for my morning glass of milk so it is not dehydration.  I know it must be blood pressure related but my bp is perfect= 120/80.  Sometimes I really feel like I am going to pass out. I hate to bring anything else up with these docs because before you know it, I will be back in the hospital being studied. I am going to give it until 2 months post-chemo and if it is still happening, I will have to consult with someone. On a positive note, I learned of a survivor's group that is a ½ day event at Yale that goes through some of the ancillary issues surrounding bc and post-chemo life. I am really, really looking forward to that. I sure hope it is informative. I want to walk out feeling like I learned something. I will keep you all posted on this one.",

      "Content": "Mar 5, 2011 03:21PM 1WonderWoman wrote: Ckptry:  a little info on the brown spots: Removal Brown spots on the face are often treatable via medication, dermatology treatments or excision. Age spots and melasma and other hyperpigmentation conditions may be treated with oral or topical medications, laser therapy, chemical peels or dermabrasion. Raised lesions such as moles or keratosis spots are usually removed by freezing, excising or laser treatments. Prevention # Most brown spots on the face are preventable. Sun exposure is the most common culprit in skin discoloration. Sun damage may not show up until later in life, but too much sun even as a child can significantly increase the chances of developing hyperpigmentation. The best defense against brown spots or more serious skin conditions is covering the skin as much as possible when outdoors. This includes longer sleeves, hats and sunglasses. Sunscreen should be applied as a part of a daily regime, especially on the face where sun exposure is most prevalent. What you also might want to do is find a creamy exfoliator you like (I can recommend one, of course!) and use a slice of loofah...real loofah and not those colorful balls sold with strings attached for showering!   Just be careful when buying loofah because there has been some drama about the safety of wild loofah.  Bottom line, a lot of this stuff, including wrinkles, is caused by dead skin cells just lying on the skin surface.  When you apply moisturizer all you do is move them around.  The only thing that gets rid of dead skin cells is exfoliating with a good loofah. As for the expense of these products, yes, you might spend $300 on yourself 2 times a year in products but if you can buy new skin for less, let me know!!!!!   Also, you have to think about what you do for yourself, truly for yourself and not the family etc.., and then decide if it is an investment you want to make.   I heard someone rave the other day about that Cindy Crawford stuff which I would never use but, in the end, none of it is cheap.  In fact, Clinique's Daily Moisturizer is less expensive than some of the Olay products AND it is been on the market for over 40 years I believe.  They have also never changed the formula so there must be something good in it! ",

Lady: I am so, so glad your scans were clear. Whew....that is very good news. I bet you are extremely relieved! So glad you went for that ooph! What a load off your mind. I am very happy for you. Iowa: on the saunas, anyone with TE's or implants should not be going into saunas. The high heat can actually cause them to melt and/or fail. Steam rooms the same thing. I absolute love the sauna and was thinking of getting one before bc showed up. I am so disappointed about not being able to go back in now. I really love the steam rooms also but the same applies. All the hot heat way of drawing impurities out of our bodies is, for those of us with recon, off the menu. Sptmm: what are your plans this weekend? I am hoping you have rest on your schedule as every weekend it seems you are off to a sporting event etc... ! Finally, we will be in the 50's here but, of course, some clouds. Can you not even wait for one, single, nice, warm weekend in April!?! I just can't wait. I hope you are having some fun for yourself these days. Iowa: hot tubs, unless it is at your home, should always be avoided. Just think of having a stock pot as big as a house and swirling a bunch of human beings around in that thing for a few months....can you just imagine the fungus?! My GP told me a while ago no public hot tubs and, in fact, it is better to just have a jetted tub. In any case, I think the problem with LE and hot tubs is if you have a cut etc... the chemicals used to treat hot tubs (fungus tubs!!) can get in your body. Of course, none of us can risk anything so cavalier now! Well, I hope you all have a nice weekend. I am going to try to get some yoga in this weekend. I so want to be in great shape again...like my kickboxing days! I lament the passing of my great body but it takes so much to keep it up. Oh well...if I want it again I will find the energy and enthusiasm to be that woman again. Good night-",

In any case, and in response to your question on hot flashes, at this address: www.imaginis.com/breast-health... I found the following information on this particularly cumbersome SE of tamox and why they happen: Hot flashes occur when estrogen is blocked in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls the body's thermostat. Some women find that regular exercise can help reduce hot flashes. If the hot flashes are particularly bothersome and do not respond to conservative measures such as exercise, calcium, or other interventions, physicians may prescribe medications such as clonidine (brand name, Duraclon) or Megace (brand name, Megestrol). Physicians may also recommend taking 30 to 60-day \"breaks\" from tamoxifen to help reduce hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms.  Hope this helps and take your of yourself, my desert friend! ",

I love the color also. Looking good, woman! If I had to liken myself to anyone, it would be Tex. I think that is close to where I am at. It is kind of fun to watch it come in and when I sweat and rub my hand over it, all the little drops of water that come flying off are like a much welcome treat! Rachel: I am beyond happy to hear you are not back at work yet!  Every time I read your posts about lack of sleep, and knowing how awful I feel each day after these hot flash, up-all-night sessions, all I could think was if I still worked, especially on Wall St, I would never be going back. I am on long term also but in the states that means you are fired!   They must fire you so you can go on the long term care policy you had been paying for while you were employed.  Are you even happier you live in Canada now?!   In any case, I was so sad to read about your tales of sleeplessness and am just happy you can weather this storm while you are out of work and hopefully, by the time you go back PT, you will be doing better. Eating: today I did not feel like it so I had chocolate milk with my vitamins and a turkey and cheese sandwich and I am still not hungry.  Who am I?  Where did I go?!  Did any of you ever go to one of those calorie counter calculator and put in your weight and it tells you how much you need to eat to maintain your current weight, how much to lose etc..?  Well I am usually not near my daily intake to maintain my weight but it does not go down!  Alas this is age too, I suspect.",

      "Content": "Mar 23, 2011 06:24AM - edited Mar 23, 2011 06:25AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, girls- Ckptry: that really is a shame about the ST basically castigating you for not doing more.  I hate to sound silly but is your son afraid of the toilet...like maybe he saw a spider or something in it?  When my brother was young, he dropped some toy in the toilet (I forget) and he BROKE the toilet trying to get it out...of course the septic system had already claimed it!  He was so upset I think my mom had some trouble with him because he now saw the toilet as the evil hole that absconded his toy!   I just thought I would offer that anecdote to perhaps get you thinking about something else that might be going on with him.  I feel for you, though.  I said it a number of times and I will say it again: those of you who are raising children and going through this are the true super heroes and you have it all over someone like me.  My heart breaks for all you moms have to deal with in addition to your bc.  Just know someone out here thinks the world of you ;)      On the tamox, what do I know about oncology but I do think that maybe herceptin and tamox is too much at once?   Perhaps after herceptin you will have a good go of it.  Don't feel awkward about crying with a stranger...you, of all people having worked at MSK, know full well how, at any moment, you might find yourself crying with those previously unknown over the enormity of the situation at hand.  We are only dotted lines to each other and if we don't help each other, who will?  I suddenly starting bawling with a male nurse just before I was getting my port put in...out of no where, whining like a lunatic!  That would be the last day I got my period, however!  I was really whining up a storm, though....I felt so bad for that guy and he was so good to me.  One thing I can say about the nurses at Yale is they are wonderful.  I had some great nurses there.  Just think of how much someone thinks of how you supported them in a time of need at MSK.  Don't worry about a thing ;) Also, on the tamox, JSW is not even on tamox with herceptin and she is having flashes.  I just think the 2 together are a lot. JSW: rockin' the herceptin!   Lady: where is that path report?! Lisa: on the weight and working out, if a 5'6\", 42 y/o woman weighing 145 who wants to maintain her weight would have to eat almost 1900 calories a day!   It does not make any sense.   Yet, if you reduce caloric intake AND workout the results are negligible.  Who is eating 2000 calories a day anyway?  They must be eating at McRat 2xs per day!  I was listening to this really nice looking guy once in LA talk about diet and exercise etc... and you could notbelieve the amount of food he ate every day when training just to maintain and build.   In any case, it was all clean like grilled eggplant and 2 grilled turkey burgers (no buns, cheese, bbq sauce etc..) or a grilled chicken breast, lettuce, cucumbers and craisins (no dressing) and the like.  I know that from training.  The food industry has us convinced we are supposed to eat for taste but to achieve true nutrition, that could not be further from the truth.  We should eat for nutrition 6 days and eat for taste 1 day!   That is LL Cool J says!  Does anyone else spend a lot of time on the phone making appointments, getting test results, talking to insurance companies etc...?   wow...!  Have not heard from the gyn on the pap yet...today is 2 weeks....",

Let's hope you won't have more of that. I found out today I am getting 4 rounds every 3 weeks and I had a bmx but still they want to radiate my underarm because of the node involvement. I know they are being cautious but I learned a lot today and none of which made me happy! Including the separate procedure to insert the port....so sick with all of this. In any case, I hope your show goes great! Kathleen: if you are active already, you should be able to breeze through. Just keep thinking that is the way it is going to be. Don't forget a lot of people have no problems with chemo at all. It is entirely feasible all will go ok for you. We all will probably feel a little something and then it will be over. I have 2 nodes affected and have 4 rounds, 3 weeks apart. They do move way more aggressive with node involvement. I am sure things will go fine for you. Don't forget...chemo is designed to SAVE our lives!!!! English Teacher: you can hang out with us as we are all going through the same things! This is the place to be....dubious place at that! I totally understand about being stunned about your diagnosis. Your BS will tell you more and more and then you, too, will be able to learn more of your diagnosis (dx). I was dx'd on April 17 and just learned of my HER2 status last week after bilateral mastectomy (bmx). Here we all are, dead of summer, getting chemo...well at least it is a good time of the year, temperature-wise, to go bald!!!!!! Jet: I am with you...Taxotere and Cytoxan...4 rounds and the port is going in as soon as my last drain from the bmx is removed next week. I don't know about you but when I heard radiation today, I was stunned. The good news just keeps coming!!!! I guess the coming year is not going to be our greatest but it is supposed to ensure that we have many more to come. We should all bid our hair farewell together? Who is shaving as a pre-emptive measure? Who is wigging?! Who is doing a scarf? I am only pretty sure I am just going bald and perhaps a scarf with hair attached. What is everyone's plans? Any good ideas? I wear baseball hats a lot so I was thinking I should cut my hair off now and make a ponytail I can put in different hats!!!!!! We can walk through this August together and surely it will be one we will never forget. Liz",

Thank you so much for your kind words and inspiration.  I find your writing very entertaining!   One question: is \"TE\" the extender?  I think it is.  I read it is painful but I think it is the safest way to go.  Do you work?  Post bilateral does anyone know, as I am in marketing and it is physically an easy job, how long generally that people are out of a non-physical job?  Just wondering.  I can easily be out for the summer with not one single complaint! Again, thank you so much for everything.  I wish you the best.  Relative to \"our\" situation, you are only a few months before me relative to diagnosis and your decision is congruent with what I believe mine will be so I look forward to hearing about how everything is going for you and I, too, am here for you if you ever want me to remind you of \"when it was worse!\"  Your few months on me will undoubtedly place me traversing spots on the pain highway that you have just forgotten about!

They are like having 3 legs.  You don't need our breasts especially once they start showing signs of trouble.",

You have every right to feel the way you do and you know what is more real than what you feel? Nothing. Unless someone has had the exact same life as you, the exact same highs and lows, they should not be attempting to impugn your feelings. I am always positive but I am also realistic and a Stage II bc being called \"in remission\" by someone outside of the medical field is outlandish at best. We do have a cloud of precariousness over us about this whole matter. I think it would take me, personally, years to feel \"in remission\" and I don't go for the emotional highs and lows the vernacular connected to this disease can cause. Consequently on the great things that could be happening, when you have one, humongous catastrophic blow, catching a double coupon break at the grocery store a good thing does not make!!!!! You have had a lot to deal with and there is no disputing that. By all means, your sister should take you to the promised land of people enthralled about remission but you better pack a bag because I think it is going to be a very, very long trip! People in \"remission (whatever the hell that is!)\" are too petrified to be optimistic! Don't worry about the damn house and the groceries. You will get to it when you get to it. You are not a robot and I am sure that if someone did make you a meal or clean your house, WITHOUT JUDGMENT, you would certainly be happy and not find something else to worry about. That would be wonderful. It hurts physically, mentally and emotionally to not be able to play with the kids and to enjoy some time with your husband. It all takes it's toll and, like I said, unless someone is in your shoes, their advice and judgment has no place. I validate your feelings and I think you should not second guess yourself, not even for 2 seconds, that the road you have been on is considered hell-and-back and don't question if you are too sensitive. Who could tell you if you were? No one. Just take things one day at a time, don't connect the value of your day to particular outcomes or accomplishments and just do what you can and if that is nothing or there is a sink full of dishes, so be it. There are 365 days in a year; don't fret about this one! The most important thing is not to judge yourself. Every second of every minute of this bc journey is new in some little, pecuniary way and totally accept the way you feel about it. Once you try, and it is not easy, to accept the way you feel about it, you won't second-guess or question the validity of your feelings again. I just wish when you reached out to someone when you were feeling down you did not get judgment but instead got some support. You know what would have been a positive thing today? If your sister said \"I understand.\" That is all it would have taken. Just a simple statement identifying with your feelings. Take it easy today, Carolyn. Do only what you feel like. I hope this day gets better for you, woman!",

I went to the dermatologist today (anyone in CT that reads this thread and needs a dermatologist referral, don't hesitate to ask, she is with Yale and is *excellent*) to get a suspicious black mark on my face looked at. I hope I give you all a good laugh....Ms. Facials and high-end skin care over here could not recognize a BLACK HEAD staring at her!!! I was moderately embarrassed! There were a few other things I was there for but that was the funniest! For those of you who saw \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" you will understand this next one. I have a dark patch of skin below where my right breast used to be and I did not know what it was. I wanted to have that checked out. Well a few weeks ago my friend and her husband were here and he said the brown spot might be Leroy, my brother from another mother (!), and that if he grows some hair, we will give him some dreads!!!! He said just like the aunt in Big Fat Greek with the lump on her neck that contained a tooth and some hair from her unborn sister, he is my \"unhatched\" brother!!!! The dermatologist got a big kick out of that one! So I had the brain CT and was pissed because I went to one building after having been told twice, including 2 hours prior when I called to see if I could have breakfast, and sure enough I arrive and had to go to another building...was a little upset! In any case, they said \"technically\" the scans look great which basically means they took a good pic! I so hated to have that dye in my head but it has to be done. I have a little headache now and will inform you all when I get the results of the scan. I am sooooo hoping and praying all is fine and those weird headaches were ocular. Tex: how did you become fluent in Spanish? Did you study? Believe it or not, Ms. Japanese-and-Chinese over here did not have such a good time of French and Spanish! I mean I got good grades but I found the gender specific conjugating annoying at best! That dance move called \"Andale\" in Zumba is actually part of a Mexican dance. I have done it while in Mexico and am now upset because I want to know what the name of that dance, that includes that Andale step from Zumba, is!!!!!!  I know my drunk ass did it...perhaps not well but blame it on the Cabo Wabo!  BTW, if you can salsa, meringue and cumbia, you will LOVE Zumba! You need to get it! The package with the Zumba sticks (sound like marachas-love them!) is $70 at Amazon. Ladyinbama: I wondered what happened to you! I missed hearing from you and seeing those cute little dogs! Having good times at the lake house? I hope you are doing well. Rachel: that is a great group that you found especially because the kids can meet other kids similarly situated. I am so happy that you found that group. It really helps the kids not feel socially alone. Plus there are things they will say to their friends and share feelings they are having which they will never share with an adult and/or parent. I am really glad they embraced it as well in talking about the new friends they met. That is good stuff! Sptmm: with the amount of working out you do, your heart will just fine, woman!!!! No worries at all! Andale, andale!!!! Do they do the andale step in your class? I love the Amazon thing because I have learned everything I need to actually do it in a gym! There is an instructional dvd which is great and I got 2 Zumba sticks, a cardio workout, a toning workout (cardio with very a dab of toning!), a 20 minute dvd and 2 live dvds and have been doing it for 1 month now. I have lost 18 lbs (or lost what I gained over chemo days!) and feel healthier than I have in over a year now. BTW, using the answering machine to avoid drama whackos is a great idea! I don't care if they are family or not, if they are acting weird about your dx/bc/situation, they must be avoided. The only people I kept around me through this entire thing are those that I laugh with...that is it!  Omaz: your docs know best. Celexa is one of the antidepressants that does not mess with Tamox. From this link: www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/ne...    I found this out: The breast cancer recurrence rate among women taking tamoxifen and the weaker antidepressants Celexa, Lexapro, or Luvox and was similar to that of women taking tamoxifen alone. I am sure you will feel better. Celexa is in the mild category. This is the problem with antidepressants and tamox: Tamoxifen mixes with a liver enzyme called CYP2D6 in the body to change into the tumor-fighter endoxifen. Many SSRIs block the same enzyme, thus preventing tamoxifen from morphing into its active form. I think you have to be above 20mgs to have it become a real issue anyway. I hope it helps you. Let me know how it goes.  I wish you the best.  Believe me when I tell you, as I threw my little tantrum about being sent to the wrong building, I reflected on what you have been saying about tamox, hormones and overall bitchiness!   Calamtykel: I can't remember the name of the test now (unbelievable!) that I had right after chemo to check my heart and be sure that it did not go down. I think that test, if the number has gone down substantially, indicates the potential for future heart problems and those that are not showing today. My number went down one point. If you feel better, get an echo. I may have had one and I just don't remember! Nuclear med does the test I am talking about....I know others here know what I am talking about! The box comes close to your face...ugh..I know JSW and Zenith both know what I am talking about...perhaps that dye is having an effect already! Well, now I guess I am going to drive myself bananas researching the deleterious effects of CT scan dye! Goodnight all-",

Those headaches I was getting were scaring me but they must be ocular. Tex: I bet that waiter hooked you guys up after your sister's accidental invitation sponsored by her sister!!!! Your poor daughter...white heads already?! That is just so not fair! Timothea, like they say, opinions are like ___holes, everyone has one! Who cares if you speak 1/3 English, 1/3 Spanish and 1/3 Spanglish...it is your house and your business! All I know is your kids will be fluent in both Spanish and English which are the most desired bilingual coupling in this country. I am with you on the headaches also. I think getting back into reading has caused mine. My GP also lingered when he looked at my eyes last visit (who has got it better than me?! My *GP* checks my eyes! He is such a good guy!) so perhaps chemo did a little damage. I am going to wait until September to get them checked as that will be 6 months post-chemo and 1.5 years since my last eye doc appt. I am hoping the remnants of chemo will be gone and my eyes will be stronger. CKptry: since chemo, if I am talking to someone who is wallowing in circumlocution, I dip into Charlie Brown's teacher a bit!!! All of the sudden that is all I am hearing! As for your cousin, that guy is horrible. I think NY will attach his pay soon. NY attaches on deadbeats. What an awful experience for your cousin, though. 13 and 10 seem to old enough to be home alone for a few minutes. On that blackhead, I officially announce I am fast becoming a hypochondriacal lunatic!!!! I hope your son is feeling better. I really think it is scary when kids get fevers because you never know what is causing them and they can, unlike the common cold, become life-threatening. I hope his ped figured it out. Sptmm: your lucky your son even got the meat back to the fridge! At least he heard something!!!!! It sounded like that doctor was moderately proud, and a bit amazed, that he pinpointed the leak! He could have stopped pressing on you, however! You sound very fancy, shmancy with your galatograms, Long Island!!!!!!! Perhaps you were singing that Katy Perry song \"ET\" when you stumbled upon this galatogram idea?! I have no breasts in any case so no galatograms for me! I did not even do nipple-sparing...I just had them both taken totally off and I have zero regrets. Bottom line, and all kidding aside, although it sounds uncomfortable, the galatogram seems to be absolutely imperative. Please keep me posted so I can look out over LI Sound and perhaps catch a glimpse of your leaving in your spaceship for this test!!!! As for men, my motto was the very antiquated \"why buy the cow if you are getting the milk for free!!!!\" Now, with all the estrogen suppression, I could very much care less. A very good friend always said I made \"the right choice\" and how they could have done without marriage and kids. I made a choice that was \"right\" for me but not \"the right choice.\" I will tell you now, even with bc, I am one of the happiest people I know!!! Another friend told me once no matter how the marriage turns out, kids are the gift of marriage. I think that pretty much sums it up for you. Rachel: don't forget, they told us unequivocally bc does not hurt. I am sure you have just woken up muscles that went to bed for a while you went through this past year. Don't worry...remember itching and orange peel skin=the only 2 outward signs of bc! Omaz: I am so glad no more mammos! That was one of the perks of getting rid of my fat sac, knee-warmer, boobs!!!!! No more bras also...so happy about that one! I was born in the 70's although, with my dislike of bras, I think am a bit of an anachronism! Did you start Celexa yet? It is mild but I am sure it will help you. If you add a vodka tonic to the Celexa you might conjure up thoughts of being with Deb at the galatogram, whisking across the sky!!! BTW, thank you so much for asking about the scan...ugh...I was nervous!  Well, I had some bloodwork today (titres for nursing school) and to check my ever-failing thyroid! That is all here, thankfully. BTW, if any of you feel good about tamox, there is a fellow \"boardie\" who needs your help.  There is a member on this board called \"Polyana\" who lives in a developing country and is about to start taking tamox. She was looking for some reassurance. I stopped by and commented a few days ago. You see, she is worried about complications with tamox and the lack of very good health care in her country. So, again, if any of you have good things to say about tamox, stop by and give her some encouragement. The topic is : \"Can I choose not to take it\" and if you search for her name, it is the first or second topic. OMG...in a completely unrelated event (!), I was in the pharmacy and saw this woman (4'9\"...I always wanted to call her a kid!) that I used to work with. She was Ms. Company Suck-Up and I know she knows I saw her but I said nothing and just walked out! I just suddenly realized I don't \"have\" to talk to her as I don't work with her anymore and I NEVER liked her to begin with!! I am so not a consummate phony!  It was so funny because I go to this pharmacy all the time and the tech said it was weird the way I looked at her, for like 40 seconds, and then just looked away! It was so funny...I guess you realize after you don't have to work with people how much you never liked them to begin with! Alas I do surprise myself these days!",

Omaz: good for you on the shiatsu!  Just like the booty shake, shiatsu will wake up muscles never used.   You are correct in that people think we are done but it is a 5 year soup-to-nuts event!  The wonders of bc.  As for reflexology, in NYC there were these foot massage places (like 10 minutes) and we used to call them reflexology lite.  It was a wonderful treat! Ginger: it is a sick case and I am glad someone from a national organization is aware of it.   How awful especially with the egregious amounts of wealth in the Fairfield County area.  It would have been one thing to tell her she had been found out and to make arrangements for her son to be moved to a different school.  How dare they have her arrested, are suing her and kicked her son out of school?  It is sick.   All these towns are crying about money and the reason they are crying now is because when times were good, they mismanaged and thieved.  Ironic how they are legally castigating someone for their exact behavior.   Like I said, if I felt better I would have gone to the rally.  My heart goes out to that woman.     There was a case earlier this year in Ohio, I believe, where the woman used her father's address to send her children to school in that district.  Now her father is a tax paying citizen from that district so, in that regard, it differs from this case.  In any event, they put her in jail for that!  I signed an online petition for that one.  I don't know what is wrong with the world today but this kind of stuff is atrocious.   Good day, all and JSW - congrats on being only 9 away from done! ",

Charlotte: a world of thanks to you for telling us about Huntsville. It is my most sincere hope that she is fine and that this is just an electrical issue. Lady has been through quite enough this past year and I hope she was spared any loss in those tornadoes. Again thank you so much for letting us know. Ckptry: Oh no, on the hair I will coloring, I will definitely take my poison! There is no way I am marching around gray and butch-looking (no offense to anyone!) this summer! In fact, the other day I was humoring myself with trying to go like an ashe blonde and then go dark again and just play with it now that it is this short. I was one of those in my youth with no weird hair colors, no tattoos, no piercings...believe it or not my parents *tried like hell* to keep me on the conservative side...poor things! Now that I have this little, short do, I am really considering experimenting. I am so glad you colored. You must feel great....it gets you closer to normal/pre-bc when you look in the mirror and see something that resembles your former self. That is so cute that your dh remarked that perhaps you had done something with your eyes! Patricia, I can only imagine how frustrating and sad it was working with those kids for years as I did it for just 4 months and it was rough. One summer I was living in my mother's waterfront condo and was a college student. When I was \"whining\" to my brother one day about my life he told me I needed a wake-up call and that I should volunteer. I called an agency and they set me up to do daycare in a battered women's shelter. I still have pics of all those kids but I had like 15-17 kids per hour, for 2-3 hours straight. One Easter I made 50 Easter baskets out of brown paper bags! They were so very happy! In any case, the building was an old rectory and the area where I did day care was a humongous, wide-open room so one day the maintenance person left an extension ladder in the room, lying down on it's side. Well when you are 2 or 3 years old, that is big even on it's side. Sure enough, I was busy watching 15 kids and the ladder tipped over and one little girl was crying and crying afterwards. I told the administrator and she was flying around to make sure maintenance got that ladder out. Well when her mother got of the meeting she was in, she wanted to FIGHT me over this matter!! I never went back. It is such a travesty but on a very banal level, there is really not much you can do. Also a friend of a fried was raised in a foster home. She used to go to concerts with us etc... and I always felt so bad for her because the stories she would tell us were absolutely hair-raising. I am reminded of Pat Benatar's song \"Hell is for Children.\" It is a travesty. I often times thought if I had a windfall/lotto winning etc.. I would make multi-floor buildings and call them \"Girl's Town.\" One floor would be etiquette, another ballet, another art, another few floors for classes and it would be a self-contained place where they would live, eat, learn, and become polished individuals ready for college. It would, of course, be like one large foster home but the upper floors would all be dorms. So, if I win \"Mega Trillions!\" I will buy several acres, probably upstate NY, make \"Girl's Town\" and a farm for handicapped animals. The girls would work with the animals, to develop compassion no-less, and then they would have school and work all on that compound. In long, it would be a boarding school type of setting for the destitute. I feel so bad that girls just roam using their bodies for barter in a society with a human tide that never ceases and with the sickest in society counting on this. It is a terribly expensive agenda but if those mega trillions ever come my way, I am launching this within a year! It breaks my heart what happens to kids not just here but all over the world. You are correct in that how do you tell an 8 year old to hold on for another 10 years...that is more than another lifetime for that child. It is really sad. Sptmm: my heart breaks for you as it was supposed to be so beautiful out today and it is barely 60 here and cloudy! I hope you are having a nice day nonetheless. Nice job on the booty shake! Once you position your feet so that you feel those odd little muscles working in your inner thighs, you are well on your way to a good shake! On the sweating, I am not an under arm sweat-er(?!) even when working out. I will see how the summer goes also. I am considering baby powder. It is so weird that I find myself questioning the chemicals in nail polish, nail polish remover, reflecting on the bc-deodorant connection rumors and the other day I found myself contemplating the chemical composition of lipsticks/glosses etc... that I have worn for umpteen years and wondering if that lip gloss is really not supposed to be eaten regularly after all!!!! BC dumped me off in a weird place...that is for sure! Texas: rockin' the play dates!!!!!!!! That is so cool. I am so happy your son feels he has a new best friend! Kick ball...YAY!!! I loved kick ball! Speaking of childhood games, \"Dodge Ball\" was on the other night and still HYSTERICAL even after I have seen it like 10 times! Well, in anticipation of this nice weather we were supposed to have today I opened nearly every window in this house and am now getting chilly! Time to start shutting a few! Good day, girls-",

I even told my cat to keep her eyes open (forgedaboudit!!!!) for little Abby and she promptly went to bed!!! Now news on the culture yet. That is really cool that you had the galactogram, that such a test exists and that it seems as if preliminarily results put you in the clear. Good stuff, woman! Deb, as 2 women with naturally curly hair, I think by July we will look as if we could join the original cast of \"Welcome Back Kotter!!!\" Do a google on that show and when you see the photos that come up, we will be eligible to be photoshop'd into it by July with the NE humidity helping out!!!!! Omaz: I totally you are correct in that we all should have an LE consult but my BS did not feel it was necessary when I brought it up. Fight the power, read the book, do everything it says to manage it. It is funny because I am so aggravated that I can't seem to get this \"stuff\" in my lungs up (thanks bronchitis!) that I considered getting an inversion table, flipping myself upside down with a heating pad strapped to my chest to loosen it and let gravity do it's work!!!!! If I had LE, I would again consider and inversion table to let gravity try to deal with some of that fluid. It is a banal line of thinking but it is mine just the same!! Schie2011: I hope you are able to go fishing on Mother's Day but remembering my days on TAC, smelling fish and being in a boat...YIKES!! I sure hope you feel good enough to go, however. Consequently, and unless you enjoy fishing, I hope that on Father's Day he is going to the spa with you! ALL: let's rally together once again and cheer our fellow BC sister, Shie2011, on as she starts TC tomorrow. Let's all send good vibes her way and help her get through this. Also, we need to send good vibes to JSW to help her get through her cancerversary tomorrow. Two big events tomorrow and we need spiritually rally!!! JSW: I am only a few weeks ahead of you on the hair and now I have full coverage, it is about ½ inch long and it is now beginning to grow into swirls!!!!!!! Lovely, very attractive look for summer!! More to this point, unless you have naturally straight hair, enjoy your final days without a fro!!!!! As for the letter, send it back and say you think it was sent you in error as you are NOT in your 40s and you have bc so perhaps they should change the tone of that letter! That should do it! Personally I really think they have to stop so that people younger women don't have to beg for attention when they have lumps. Poor Tex went through hell trying to get someone to pay attention to her because of her age. They really have to stop making it a middle-age to older-woman disease. This is also causing mammos to still be doled out based on age. Again, I urge \"Fight the power!!!\" Well, girls, I am going to get moving on my daily chores. I hope you all have a wonderful day. Perhaps I will do some more hunting for that little Abby today as we have coyotes out here. Good day, all-",

Cinco is one of my favorite holidays as, in my mind, it marks the start of summer! Sue: congratulations! SO glad you are ok! JSW: I jumped the gun as I thought you were done this Thursday but you did say boosters more than once! I guess I need to put my glasses on! We will celebrate next Thursday! Sptmm: speak for yourself, Long Island, on the spring-like weather! I walked out on my back porch with my Jeter shirt on and walked right back in! It was in the 50's here today and I work a light winter coat! This is a dumb story! During chemo I shopped online for a few winter jackets. I found this one that looked cute and, as I don't like Gortex jackets in the winter, it looked light and like it might be a good option for me. It came in and I put it on and it was cute until I noticed this gold studded cat on the sleeve! As it turns out, I bought this coat made by Russel Simmons wife, :Kimora Lee, and it is called \"Baby Phat!\" In any case, my nieces and nephews and the people at Yale would have some fun at my expense when I sported this jacket and one person remarked that I now had \"street cred!\" with my Baby Phat jacket!!! In any case, I bought 2 other jackets online that weren't such letdowns! It was the Baby Phat coat that I wore with the hood zipped off today and where some of the guys at Sears Auto, where I went to drop more money on tires today, were also teasing me about my street cred!!!!!!! All jokers! Wait until I have my Kotter do....then I will show them!!!!! Lady: I would like to come to Alabama just to squeeze your adorable little dogs!!! How are you doing these days? So glad no damage to either home. There are a bunch of dogs en route Connecticut now from the tornado-struck areas in need of homes. There are several adoption functions this weekend. Calamtykel: you have an inversion table!!! YAY!!! I really want to get one. I was looking at them on one of the home shopping channels at 4AM when I was up with more hot flashes. I figured with my new \"bat\" like sleep patterns, perhaps I should start sleeping hanging upside down on the damn inversion table and like my soon-to-be bat family would!!!!! Texas: do those circles I told you about where you go counter and clock with your index fingers, around both eyes, gently patting as you go. It is sort of like dabbing with your index finger. That strengthens your eye muscles. I hope you are ok. Shit, I think I will come to TX for Halloween and you and I can go out glowing! Surely we will both glow naturally by then with the amount of scans we have had! I am coming to Houston in September. If you are within a few hours of Houston I would like to meet up. I am going to visit my brother, Tom-ass! Oh yeah...I had nursing school drama today, too. There are 12 community colleges in CT where I can take that one A&P course I need to get pathing on the nursing program. In any case, I can take a placement exam at one of the schools to bypass the need to take bio again BUT that placement exam is not college wide SO I would have to take it at every school because I have no idea where I will find an opening in A&P. I have ZERO questions now as to why there is a nursing shortage in this country!!!!!!! I am glad you gave that administrator an earful. It is rude to keep you sitting for an hour after you traveled 3 hours to get there and then start talking about rescheduling? No way...she would have gotten it from me as well. OMG...speaking of people getting it from me today at the grocery store I made the HUGE mistake of getting into the 12 items or less SELF-SERVICE register and the lady behind me thought she was going to become a comment factory. Well, she learned pretty quick she was fast going to become a \"shut her face\" factory! Then the guy behind her starts with \"well, at least I can count\" so I said \"well, if you could, perhaps you would count your teeth, of which your attitude probably helped you lose a few, and realize you are missing some and get your freakin' grill fixed!!!!!\" I proceeded to tell him it was not a fundraiser and I did not ask for his 2 cents either!!!!! He just looked and had NOTHING to say! I need to go to work on Chelsea Lately where my snapper head attitude will be cherished! SWAT training!! WHOO HOO! What fun?!??! Mommichelle: CHA- CHA- CHA- CHIA HAIR!!!!!!! Nice growth! That is a bad hat you are wearing! Omaz: the culture are that it is infected but no more than it has been all along...gross city!!!!! All I have to say is Christina Aguilera has some serious pipes and she should have never gotten married to that jerk and stunted her professional growth!!!! I just found \"Stripped\" from 2002 rummaging around in the basement (my fav thing lately!) and I love every song on that disc. I hope she makes a serious comeback.",

The biggest enemy when it comes to your abs is sugar and not just candy.  It is all carbs from pasta to rice to bread and even vegetables like corn and peas are nutritionally considered carbs.  If you cut out almost all sugar and work a medicine ball hard on a decline bench, you might be able to firm it up and get an 6 or 8 pack.   Fat is burned in muscle so the more muscle you develop in a trouble area, the more your muscles will work to address that problem! If your library gets that book, and this is coming from someone in the fitness and health world for several years, and read it, he will open your eyes to peramanently shutting down those sugar cravings.  The only thing is, it is a very challenging situation for a person with bc and who is a vegan or vegetarian to make the changes in diet necessary to stabilize blood sugar as it requires eating meat!   The vegan/vegetarian options are almost all soy based. In any case, hope you enjoyed Sea World!  Last time I was at Sea World was in CA...no, wait...I think once in FL since then...oh, I don't know!  I forget...getting old! I will try to post one of my old body building photos later-",

Sptmm: I am sooo glad it is a draining seroma!!!!!  whew!   Glad to hear that!   As for that book, he will teach you how to stabilize your blood sugar levels so you don't crave sugar soo much.  The book is *not* for diabetics but rather it is written for everyone.   I thought of you this weekend as there was a lax tournament in Hartford between Hartford and Cornell.  I think Hartford lost!  I am totally with you on that \"tired of being a patient\" business.   I am going to a survivorship clinic and I got an automated phone call today telling me my appt w/Dr. whatever is blah blah blah!  I called right away and I was nice but said please, not another doctor!  They said no, the computer just leaves that message.  What this clinic will do is giving me a total map of what scans I need, when, a timeline etc... of what I can expect this coming year.  I am so happy and will report back my findings. It is hard to cut out sugar.  Don't be hard on yourself!   Belly dancing will tighten up that area however!    Texas: when I was dxd I totally *gave up* Diet Coke!   The phenylketoneurics are terrible, especially for people who already have cancer, so out that went.  I also gave up coffee.  Now all I drink is seltzer, water, tea or milk (usually in the morning with my vitamins).  Giving up sugar as a vegetarian is virtually impossible.  With us both being ER+ and soy being knocked out of the box, goodbye gardenburgers, garbanzo beans, sweet potatoes etc...    Really, I have totally cleaned up my eating this past year but I still knew I was doing something wrong somewhere along the way.   Well, Mr. McDonald set me straight!  I am so glad I ordered that book.  I don't ever order any books like that or get involved with fad crap programs but because I know I can count on Chelsea Handler NOT to lie, and she so ardently supported his wisdom, I had to find out more.  The book is great.  I read it once and am reading it again now. I feel that now that I have started taking his advice, reading the book again is going to help me absorb even more information and, of course, pick up on things I missed the first time around. I hope you get Zumba!  Oh, btw, I think it is Quebradita that I like?!  In any case, when you get it, you will see them do it.   It is fun! Tex, on chicken and fish, if you are comfortable with it I would continue to get the protein.   Even I had to give in on the meat thing.  Reason being is bc is started when a cell either calls for a protein delivery and it is not sent OR it is sent, knocks on the door and the cell does not answer.  It makes me nervous because we are carnivores but I did not really embrace that idea totally.  I have said this before and that is what upsets me is they (the manufacturing jokers) have poisoned our food sources with their capitalism.  I don't know what the answer is but I am no happier with the \"meat\" thing than you are! Well, my new plan is to go to bed early so when the middle of the night hot flashes start, I already have a few hours in!  Good night, girls-",

My hair is growing forward like when it gets a little fluffier, and I move past my Pee Wee look, I will start looking like that jackass Trump!!!! OMG....I am appalled!!! I went to Survivorship Clinic today and it was fabulous! You meet with a social worker, a dietician (she gave me some great information), an APRN/onc team, and a PT. They were all wonderful and you spend like 20/25 minutes with each. What they do is talk about what you have been through, what you can expect, managing those awful emotions that come along with every ache/pain etc.. being recurrence etc.. It was the best 3 hours I have spent anywhere in a long time. They gave me a lot of information and I am still reading through some of the material. How it works now is I go another 3 times, once every 6 weeks. They track your progress, how things are going and how you feel overall about what you have been through. It is a top notch program and I am so glad they have it. Something else hit me today and that is how wonderful it is to be in the company of great thinkers, learned people and, of course, highly intelligent. Say what you want about Yale, they turn out some great minds. I am sure as the next few days unfold I will have my usual \"ooh...I have to tell the girls about that\" moments and I will post some more! With the social worker, at the end we did a session where myself and 3 other women in the clinic today did a meditation session.  It was great as I am not as good at meditating as I would like to be.  She taught us that through breathing, when you start to get scared and nervous about you future and recurrence etc..., to concentrate on your breathing, and focus on oxygen moving in and out of your nose to stay focused.  It was really great.  She also gave us a dvd on relaxation through meditation.  Finally, we did another breathing exercise where we alternate between our thumb and index finger, closing one nostril at a time and breathing in and out, then alternating.  It was great because it helped me to focus more than the first exercise.  It was all together a really great experience. A great take-away I want to share with you now is on vegetables: I learned that every vegetable has a different array of phytonutrients(the cancer fighters best friend!) and eating a rainbow of fruits and veg is the only way you really get all of the possible phytonutrient combinations because they are in the skin/the color of the fruit or vegetable one consumes. I found that very interesting. The dietician explained to me all about it and I can't verbatim list it here but she was very helpful. She gave me this handout with a rainbow of fruits and vegetables on the cover! It is set up really clever. Also, on LE, the PT explained what I pretty much knew/heard and that is the potential to develop LE can be set-off by changes in atmospheric pressure we experience when we fly. He suggested I do get fitted for a compression garment, as I am flying in September, and better safe than sorry. I flew once without one already but I did not tell anybody and just took my good ol chances! In any case, he made sense and I was glad I met him also. Plus we are about the same age and he too likes to workout to Motley Crue so it is all good!!!!!! Sam: thanks for the update on Iowa=good news! Tex: can you freakin' believe it?!!! Hair on my thighs?! Man, I am just annoyed now! We have to take a lot of crap in this cancer battle and this last little nugget just is leaving me pissed off!!!!!!! Fur on my thighs! Tex, I think I am going to let it grow way out on my thighs and then make my own extensions!!!!! Speaking of extensions, crazy Liz over here went to local beauty school to find out if they will take my bag of my previous hair and make me extensions because I thought there had been a domestic development recently. In any case, no dice as it is still a process completed only off of our shores. OMG...did you hear about salons being broken into and their \"human\" hair being stolen?! Unbeweavable!!!! Sptmm: Deb...are you trying to challenge me to the \"BC Summer 2011 Race to Look like Gabe Kotter?!?!?!\" It would seem so!!!! Like I said, I am clearly in Pee Wee territory and then when it grows a little more and I color it, I will be so Trump-esque! In any case, I am so with you on the short hair for the summer. I could never tolerate long hair right now with these hot flashes! I am hoping that by next summer it is shoulder length...hoping! I was about 1/3 to ½ way down my back when this all started. I hope everyone is doing well tonight and you all had a nice day! I am so glad I was invited to the survivorship clinic. It was great and it really made my day. It so cool also because all these little questions that I have can be answered in a few hours at that clinic, in one day, by 5 different professionals. Very good stuff, indeed! Night, girls-",

I can't believe it. Speaking of weather, I feel so bad for those in the MW dealing with all of those tornadoes as Ladyinbama had to a few weeks ago. It is just so sad. If I did not have a hole in my chest I would go volunteer. I can't imagine how they must feel. Sptmm: we finally have some good weather!!!!! YAHOOOEEE! I am so excited...I opened up all the windows in the house and all the windows on the cars....I am so happy for a dry day! OMG...it was getting too much, that 10 days of rain! I have pics of my hair and I actually found a pic where I am posing in the living room but I can't find any body building photos, per se. I also have a pic of me screwing around in Central Park. I am wearing roughly $2000 worth of clothing and wait til you see it....3 sheets to the wind comes to mind!!!!! Ah, alas I lived!!!!! I will keep hunting for more photos. In the interim, I just threw the few I have found on Flickr and still don't know how to get them here directly so, here goes: http://www.flickr.com/photos/63307850@N03/5760051514/ IN this one, I am having some inebriated fun in Central Park with my boyfriend who was a photog for CNN....he captured a nice pic!  www.flickr.com/photos/63307850...  In this one, I am flexing so you can see some muscle, especially in my arms and neck but that is about it!  http://www.flickr.com/photos/63307850@N03/5760062404/ This one is my hair today....see my halo?!?!?!! Texas: that song is way old but it rocks!!! I think it is perfect for us! You might remember it from the battery commercial where some flies are dancing around and they are playing that song and, of course, flies have a very short life so the point was to show how this one fly, who used a certain battery, was dancing away etc.. it was funny! Tex, that is so sad about your dd asking that....uh...kind of heartbreaking actually. They don't know, they are so young. You all will be alive having some fun and that is all she needs to know!!! Ckptry: fat skinny is great!!! Honestly, if you did pilates for ½ hour a day for 2 months you would be amazed at how much more tone and thin you would look. It will totally develop that nice tone everyone wants and can only be gotten through pilates! You are lucky btw....fat-skinny is a total blessing! I am glad things seemed to go ok and were not too tumultuous at the school. Did you bring your sister and was dh able to go with? Just wondering. Everything is so expensive these days with being out of work for so long etc.. I feel it. This, too, shall pass. Lady: I will work up a playlist! I have tons of playlists for working out and I will try to find some stuff that perhaps you might like. Good luck with the kidney stones....stone them!!!!! Ginger and Lil: good luck on Arimidex. Ginger: I had no idea that song was from/for/in 42nd Street. That is a great tune! As for depression, I think everyone at some point or another experiences it. I know I went into such a tailspin after 9/11 but I refused to take any meds. I was a lost soul. Use the meds, be happy, be healthy and look forward. You are definitely not alone in any of this. I also think you need to plan 2 weeks at the equator each winter/early spring. I agree with Tex that the PNW has a lot of gray time and you may have a touch of that need-for-sun a few times, or even 3 weeks a year. Omaz: I am so glad tamox has been uneventful for us. I am 12 weeks in and still just hot flashes = I'll take it! I love that they are petting you! I think your hair looked great in the last photo. I am so grateful for the little bit I have! It actually does look pretty good short and I am getting used to it...en route longer hair, of course! My favorite anchor on CNBC, Mark Haines, died unexpectedly at his home last night. I can't believe he is gone. My mornings will never be the same :( He smoked and always carried extra weight in the stomach area but still no word on what the cause of death was. I am so sad :( This was such a reminder of how short life can be....I am still reeling from this. He was one of the co-anchors on squawk box. I have watched that show quite religiously since 1999. How time flies. I hope you all are having some nice weather!  Today was perfect here and I totally enjoyed it! Sptmm: we have one heck of a nice night ahead of us here and I cannot say enough good things about this amazing weather!  After that long winter, I think I am just so grateful!! ",

Ginger: I was just talking to a friend about how my mom's birthday is Tuesday and she has MRSA so I am not supposed to go and see her because I still have an open wound but am going to throw caution to the wind and run in and see her (she is in an ALF) for a few minutes.  In any case, he said (and I believe he is right), they really do misdiagnose MRSA frequently and, as his mom is in the hospital right now and has been in and out for the past 2 years, he never wears the gown etc... and feel hospitals and docs are dramatic about how easily it can be spread.  Now, having said that, and because of our precariousness w/the bc business, if you have any cuts stay away from making contact with him. This link will help you learn more: www.mayoclinic.com/health/mrsa... I hope your poor DH gets better.  MRSA is a pain to get rid of if you even ever can.

BTW, that mother in Norwalk has been framed in some drug busts.  It is pretty bad what they are making her look like.  I think she is being totally set up to save face for the municipality and to make her look like the nefarious one, not them.  Sptmm: how are things going? Did you win mega millions and are being purposely circumspect?! Calamtykel: I am going to Six Flags NE in a few days but it is no Great Adventure!!! LOL that you were packing ativan at Six Flags!!!!! Good that you thought of that. I am going to post the info on alkalinity later today. I keep starting and getting sidetracked. You were actually the first person to bring to my attention the importance of alkaline state. I feel this bc business is so multi-faceted, it is imperative everyone help each other to keep track of the details so I thank you for that. Rachel: How are you doing? Did you go on vaca? Something tells me you are gone this week....to Disney! Hope you are having fun with your rather stylish hair non-cut....just growing in fashion fab!!!!! Texas: is away as well...I miss you, woman! I hope you found a suitable suit! I was joking with Tex that we, for the first time in 27 years, are concerned with stuffing our bathing suits!!! Omaz: did you enjoy your vaca, yachting around the Mediterranean? You see, your lack of details makes me fill in the blanks! Adey: I kind of wish I was not infected and could have gotten rads. I am so happy you got rads. I hope you are doing well. JSW: clean your house out of any good stuff ie: high end carpet, high-end appliances etc.. and rent it. Tell the tenant you are trying to sell and just rent it. There is no reason in this world to leave an asset in the antithesis of fermentation! If you can't sell it, make sure it is growing in value for you while it sits. If I were you, I would comfortably even give a 1 year lease and back off the sale idea totally. I firmly believe this RE market is in the crapper and it is not coming out soon. I think if you end up in AL for a few years and rent it, you will be able to sell more easily then. Also, for instance, if the mortgage is 1200 and you rent for 1650, you give 100 to a local \"property management\" co to answer maintenance calls etc.. and you are still coming out with a few bucks each month and don't have to worried about going from AL to FL. It makes life easy. I am growing more suspicious of this \"mass\" in my chest especially after I got my notes from my last visit to the onc where he declares \"there is no mass\" in that breast. Therein lies the caveat which will send me seeking other opinions. I hope you all have a lovely day. PS-I can't believe this Casey Anthony trial.",

I am pissed about so many things right now all related to these doctors and all this cancer crap! I have had it! Sptmm: you speak the truth, woman. A tactile investigation is completely uncalled for. Especially when I am getting stomach sick after I eat, my lips are perpetually chapped (taken together it is a sign of a gastrointestinal problem), all my joints hurt and both acchilles are hurting. Add to that the alternating numbness in both hands on the thumb, index and middle fingers and I don't sound like the picture of health. You know what bothers me the most about the joint pain? That is the way I felt when I was dxd. It seems to me like they collect their money, study us and then wash their hands. Well, I made a lot of phone calls today and none of which I am sure they are going to be happy about but I don't give a shit. This is my health, not theirs. About the coasters, please go and ride the stand up coaster!!!!! I love coasters! I wanted to see if I was going to feel well enough to ride at Six Flags NE today but alas our plans were rained out. I did not even want to take a chance as those tornadoes that decimated parts of Springfield and surrounding areas are not far from Six Flags so we cancelled. Calamtykel: I am so worried about you now. That is frightening that they forwarded your results right to the surgeon. I hope everything is ok. They probably forwarded just to allow your surgeon just to be sure and that was the right thing to do. At least you are not dealing with \"magic fingers central!\" Kel-please let us know when you get home how things went. Kel also the one thing (the onc team) told me was because it \"moved\" was a good sign?! I don't feel that it moves but rather the skin around it moves. I am going for 3rd and 4th opinions if need be. I am getting to the point where I don't trust any of these doctors. Ginger: at the risk of repeating myself, all they did was \"touch\" the lump and declare it scar tissue. Even a friend who is a dr in NYC said that sounds ludicrous and cavalier. I am so glad your mammo was clear! Good for you! I am very happy for you to get some good, calming news. Sorry about your DH. I don't know how stuff such as MRSA is running so rampant. I had worries about it when I was in the hospital for this infection. No good. Rachel: thanks on the advice. I am going to get more opinions out of this area and see where I go from here. I am also really worried about feeling stomach sick after I eat. Never in my life have I felt this way. As far as I am concerned there are the chemo doctors and the cutters and that is it for doctors in our cancer genre. It sucks because when you have other stuff going on, there is no support. We are required to tote around a 3 ring binder with all our medical history in it from doctor to doctor. I am glad your friend went to get a 2nd when she was on vacation. Good for her! JSW: thanks for the telling me to take my own advice! Good advice! I am not too happy right now with any of these doctors. Well, girls, I hope you are having nice days for yourselves. It was a good day in CT to be on the phone all day! I will keep you all posted and thanks so much for your support.",

Today I met with my PS who said that the lump is scar tissue, I am healing nicely and she introduced me to a NEW system for recon where they use your own body fat!!! It is amazing...it is the \"Brava\" system. It is not FDA approved/regulated but what you do is wear this suction cup bra deal for 10 weeks, 10 hours per day and what it does is slowly stretch the skin and then what they do is fill the pockets that the suction cup bra made with your own body fat!!!!! Wait, it gets better: if you don't like the results/want them perkier or bigger, you can then have implants put it!!! Basically it is like recreating the jokers that were trying to kill me and then using implants as they were originally intended!!!! I am so very excited! I will be the first one my PS does it with but I figured there is nothing more innocuous than using the body's own (excess!!!) fat to create new boobs for me! This is so cutting edge and do you know how many women who have yet to join us in this fight will be enthralled about this option? I think even Tex remarked how she was not an implants type of person. Well this would even be great for her. I know it is not going to be easy, there will be bumps in the road etc.. but I am willing to go the whole road and let them try this process on me. Dr. Khouri in Miami started doing this some 10 years ago using Brava to enhance the breasts of women who felt woefully unprepared for our mammary concerned society but who also did not want implants. Well, girls, this is all good! I also think my stomach sickness after I eat might have been being caused by coffee which I reintroduced into my diet about a month ago. I got off of coffee again and am not feeling stomach sick after I eat. I guess chemo continues to affect our bodies as I drank coffee for 20 years before chemo. I guess I can have a cup on occasion but not daily. I hope everyone had a lovely day and Omaz, I hope you don't melt!",

This element changes the way estrogen is metabolized and may prevent estrogen driven cancers. Cruciferous vegetables also contain a kind of phytochemical known as isothiocyanates, which stimulate our bodies to break down potential carcinogens (cancer causing agents). I would definitely join the study.  I can't see why you should not.   I think it would be great to be part of that study. Sadly, and because I have such an awful thyroid condition, something else I know about cruciferous vegetables is raw cruciferous vegetables contain thyroid inhibitors known as goitrogens. Goitrogens like circumstances that cause goiter, cause difficulty for the thyroid in making its hormone. Isothiocyanates appear to reduce thyroid function by blocking thyroid peroxidase, and also by disrupting messages that are sent across the membranes of thyroid cells. People who have hypothyroid function should consider limiting and steaming cruciferous vegetables. I only grill or steam vegetables but, and for the reasons noted above, I do limit them. Calamtykel: nice pic!   Isn't summer fun?  Just the things you do when it is warm and the sun is out...it is good for the soul.  I am only pretty sure I am FL bound w/in 5 years.  This past winter did it and I love this summer weather.   Are you liking the taste of the kale smoothies any more?  Have you found any tricks for flavoring?  ",

Also, I am smelling weird stuff....like dog crap and I did not have any on my shoe! I was driving along and I suddenly smelled that odor so I pulled off to the side to check my shoes! There are more weird odors where that came from. This is getting nerve-wracking. When I google salty taste and weird (seemingly non-existent) odors I get brain tumor! Geesh....I am a hot mess!!!!! Calamtykel: did you get any sleep last night? I hope so. I have been getting a fragmented 5 each night for about 6 nights and last night was no different. I got up, had cottage cheese and mango (love that mangoes are in season and soo yummy!) and then went back to bed! I woke up about 4 hours later so now I only have about 10 hours of sleep to catch up on! I revere your for your dedication to running, woman! I read that Katie Holmes runs 10 miles per day. Kel, that is my dream. I would love to be able to run that much. I used to be able to run 5 miles but never 10. As for sleeping with someone, I don't like sleepovers! I mean they can come over but then they must go! A very good friend of mine and I, on and off, discuss marrying for tax and other associated benefits and we both agree we will have separate rooms!! A lot of people are married but sleep in different beds. I would not give up my space for anything. An ex of mine lived in a palatial home growing up and his mother and stepfather basically had separate wings. They are still married, and happily, today! There is nothing wrong with liking to sleep alone but with windows that don't open in the family room, you 2 will have to cozy up for a few months! Sptmm: caught ***3*** trout!??! Unbelievable! Did you catch any human beings when you were casting?!?? I am very happy you had a nice weekend. I wish I had signed up for something like that this summer. I lament the fact that I don't have a pool right now! I really would love to have a pool especially today. Of course, I really can't get wet because of this hole in my chest that is still open and the bathing suit issue is another story all together now that I am boobless! I can dream, though, can't I?!?!? OMG---almost forgot to tell you: I got my \"Bellydancing for Beginners\" DVD today!  Ordered it off Amazon.  Looking forward to this.  I love it and I love the music.  Have you gone back to your class yet?  Sweeney: I love the new avatar! You look great. Your hair is coming in nicely also. Thanks for the well-wishes on the waiting room madness! Here we go again.... BTW, you are looking like the Irish flag once again! Omaz: I lived on the ocean for almost 10 years and then lived in an waterfront community (LI Sound) when I was young so I was always at the beach.  It is good for the soul.  Something odd about me is I can't be landlocked.  Like as much as I think CO is beautiful, I could never live there.  Never.  I can't be away from the ocean.  It isn't even a preference but rather a necessity.   I would love to windsurf again.  Have not done that in years. I am going to go work out. I need to do something. I am driving myself mad with nervous energy waiting for these results and I don't have such a good feeling about what is coming this time, either. I sure hope I am totally wrong on this one! Have fun, girls-",

The only thing is I thought we were supposed to have 4 sessions but apparently today was it. I did ask to go back and see the nutritionist so I am allowed a 3rd visit. I really think it was 4 times when they started it and now it is down to 2. All the chiefs seem to indicate it was only twice at inception but we Indians seem to all remember that it would be 4 visits?! Alas, it was a good experience. I guess on the CT scan, because we can't MRI they are going to do another sonogram. We now have a baseline sonogram and I guess they would be doing another to see if that \"thing\" is changing/growing etc.. . I guess time will tell. It is just living with the suspense of \"no idea\" that is killing me. Also my APRN told me that a liver biopsy is really kind of dangerous. I had no idea. It really depends on where the mass is as to whether they will biopsy at all. As always, I remain cautiously optimistic! Calamtykel: great new avatar!!!! That is funny about you wanting to go on the slides more and the kids wanting to go home! That is great! Glad you had a good time. Please let me know what you find out tomorrow. I guess it is really good that they are not buzzing us up with results right away as, like everyone here said, if it was bad they would undoubtedly be right on it.

Sptmm: Deb, why don't you put ALL the clips in your hair each holding down 10 or 12 strands!!!! I promise you I will come visit you at Bellevue!!! This entire bc deal is making me psychovegetative! I swear, I cannot wait to put this behind me, to get these last surgeries done and get back to my life. I am officially TIRED of bc and all the nonsense. I have a life to get back to. It is unbelievable how tired of all this cancer crap I am getting. I need these new boobs fixed up, get it over with and move on! Geesh...I hope this is all done by the end of this year. I want a cancer-free 2012! I hope you all have sweet dreams-",

Hoping the weather stays nice. Also there is a farmer's market so perhaps I can get a red pepper for less than 2.50!! Houses, gas, food...everything is more expensive in good, old CT! Sweeney: those are the best vacations where there is no connectivity but, to be honest, I don't think I could do it ever again! Not a week! OMG...I would be having terrible withdrawals between my stocks and the market and ebay and all the texts etc... I used to be able to come home, put my phone on a table by the door where I would leave it charging until the next day. Those days are long gone! I cannot be without my phone. I hope you are able to have a nice week and enjoy your lack of connectivity! I *might* be able to do it for one day, maybe 2 but that is definitely it! Two weeks? You must tell me if you survived without touching your phone etc... Texas: swiffer definitely does not have scrubbing action. I got the wet sheets to put on my regular swiffer but even those are like a glossing over. I really think someday a really good scrubby/spongy mop will come out and, until then, hands and knees it is! JSW: where you been?  Did you sell your house? Have you moved yet?  Perhaps that is where you are?  Enough with my questions!  Check in, woman!  I hope everyone is having a good weekend. Happy trails, all-",

Calamtykel: it is just tiring to think that bc was not enough but that cancer patients have to be financially accosted over bills. It is very much awful. If those clowns in Washington would stop bickering perhaps we could get down to some real issues like why are cancer patient's bills being turned over to collections like they are slackers rather than just sick. Texas: have a great time! I hope you enjoy yourself thoroughly! Someone just tweeted to Nightline that it is so cold in Washington they needed sweat pants! I was in New Hampshire earlier this week and it was pretty chilly at night however CT is now pretty close to what I think hell might be like...both day and night!!

In any case, verbal diatribe over, you look great!!! Iowa: enjoy the lake! I so wanted to go to the beach today but I was not going to the beach in 100 degree weather without being able to go in the water because of this damn open wound. I want to wind surf again. I am actually thinking of going to surf next year but I will have to go to Montauk (I will pick up Sptmm on the way!) or Nicaragua! In any case, I digress!

He did not know what to make of my Christopher Walken hair!!!!!!!!!! PUNKS! There are all punks!!!!!!! He was so funny and he turned red...I felt bad for him. He did not mean it of course and I am joking but it was most definitely funny especially when he stammered a bit! Calamtykel: This weather is EXCELLENT! I am loving it. Still too afraid to go out and soak up the D but I am very, very happy with the weather! I hope you feel better soon and get some sleep but, if you are not falling off naturally, reach for momma's little helper, Benadryl!!!! That was interesting about the 2 groups. I really think diet and lifestyle changes are necessary after a cancer dx because, and as you know, the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result! Not saying any of our lifestyles/diet caused it but if we don't make some changes, clearly we could be expected to have some health problems going forward. Ckptry: rockin' the gym!!!!! Good for you! I love, love weight lifting. It is my favorite! My workouts have been really off these past 2 weeks. I have to get back on track. Carolyn, make a list of these \"Caitlin\" comments like \"hair medicine\" and now this one today!!!! Keep copious, if not contemporaneous notes and then when she wants her first YZ, you can remind her of how these little comments shall now cost her!!!! Joking...that is so funny! She is a riot! It is great, though, that they keep you laughing. Is getting and epidural for lower back pain SOP? Just wondering. I only heard of them when people give birth but now that I think about it, it does make sense it could also be use to relieve non-pregnancy pain! Carolyn, that is great that you are getting in with the new doc that perhaps thinks a bit more like Kel's doc. I hope you do find something out. The Vit D story is way too talked about and suggested, across all lines, in the onco community so I would definitely say where there is smoke, there is fire! Definitely get the test done. I am so glad you are going. We really need to see different docs and get other opinions. I am glad you came across this information and have a Friday appt. Good for you- Omaz: how are you feeling these days?   Anything new shakin' in the desert?! I hope you are well. Well, I have an early morning and visitors tomorrow then dinner at a friends and in between I have to go to a scrap metal yard (I used to get excited to go to Nordstrom's!!!!!) and to Lowe's for some more stuff! I am so excited to be creating again...good times, good stuff! BTW, does anyone else/had anyone else's port scar hurt? My port scar hurts still months after I had it removed. The woman who took it out was a bit of a hack! I am not going to go asking anyone about why it hurts because I don't want another test...ever!",

Rachel: I know you had a good experience in Canada with healthcare, as did Sweeney I believe, and I also met a woman on these boards from Scotland who did not have any problems either.  Sad to report, our taxes are already wicked high...there is not much left to get us to the 45-50% mark that indicates socialism.   They have already gone nuts taxing us just to run the country as is.  I don't know what the answer is but I have not heard too much of any bad about socialized medicine although you all have been on it since the dawn of time.   Moving this massive country to socialized medicine I think might cost more money than there is in the world!!!  Sptmm: so glad Kieran is home!   I need you strong so we can open our gym in Westchester!    This is just a friendly reminder...if any of you find yourself with a broken wireless device and still in contract and thereby unable to get a new phone or leave the carrier without paying an ETF, you can always buy a phone off of Craigs which will get you through.  Please, please remember to always VERIFY THE ESN (equipment serial number) before handing over any funds.   Same for Ebay and anywhere else you might pick up a replacement/spare device.  The market is seemingly flooded with stolen phones currently so tread carefully!   As you all know, I worked in marketing for a large wireless provider and I myself tried to buy a modem in Craig's list as my current one is acting up just a bit and I wanted to be prepared in case it goes.  In any case, this OLD JOKER showed up at Starbucks with a stolen modem!!!  He almost crapped his pants when he saw the shirt I was wearing and upon talking to me realized I worked for the company.  He sheepishly collected himself and walked out to his Lexus and drove off!!!!   I could not believe it.  He was saying \"oh, this is not for you etc...\" and walked out.  I just watched him stunned!   He was getting antsy because I told him I wanted to call the carrier to verify the ESN!   Be careful, girls!  This economy is creating a new breed of desperation.

Hair: even with the cut I am fast going Walken again!!!!! Oh well...in a few years this won't be the case but, until then, I need to just accept what is going on and remember it is better than no hair! Lady: I will totally be thinking of you this weekend. I hope you are well and going very strong into your final chemo Tuesday. I wish you the best. What an arduous battle you have had on your hands. Sptmm: you make a very good point about us being far removed from the dx now and how it is not front-and-center in our thinking. That is a very good point. BTW, no, I don't want to lose any fingers or toes!!!!! Geesh...I don't miss those boobs but I would definitely miss dearly the loss of any of my other appendages! I am very glad to hear Kieran is doing better. That is great news. It is just another thing that you don't need right now and I am very happy for you that he is stronger and you can focus again on your upcoming surgery. Clearly I would prefer you not have anything to think about relative to surgeries but alas dealing with just that is quite enough. Plus you hate to see kids sick and of all things meningitis. He is better just in time for school! Ckptry: that is so perfectly interesting their analysis of Aidan and why he continues to behave in such a way. I found that fascinating. Sometimes I like to think of psychoanalysis/psychology/psychiatry as a bunch of malarkey but then there is a story like this where clearly it has had a huge impact and provided you a breakthrough that is priceless. At least you know how to proceed. You know, it is funny but I remember finding it funny when my parents would get mad! I never knew why I found it so funny! I just figured it was part of my overall self-righteous indignation and overall bitchiness/I-will-do -whatever-I-want mentality!!!!! I kid you not when I say one of the reasons I did not want kids was being fearful of having one like me! As for using the same tricks on the kids, husband, pet, I noticed my sister doing that some years ago. I always thought it was interesting but I guess we are all the same! Also, with the anthropomorphizing of our animals (treating them like humans), they are just like family and surely we will employ the same tactics to make them behave! In any case, I am really glad you got to the bottom of that situation...no pun! My addiction to HGTV continues! I am going to watch \"Property Virgins\" and then it is on to \"Design Star\" tomorrow night!!!!! I love it. Good day to you all and may the force be with you!",

Sptmm: you are more than welcome, sister!  Come on over!   I am going to put one of my cars in the backyard hopefully far enough away from the super huge pine trees!  The trees over here are tall and old....recipe for disaster.  Also, my bff's FIL died and now I have to go to a wake tomorrow night. I am scooting right home after as it is outside Hartford and that is a bit of a ride for me.  Tomorrow my last chore is bringing in the hose on the roller thing (I am so technical!!) and then setting up one spot in the house with all my lighters, candles and strategic flashlight placement!  I am already quasi-emergency prepared as I have flashlights in every room!  I am weird like that and I put reminders in my Blackberry to check my fire extinguishers and smoke alarms.   I think 9/11 really did me in mentally!  I will definitely leave a light on for you, woman!  OMG--so funny...Gov Malloy was on the news this afternoon and there was someone with him doing sign language at his side.  I got the impression he was getting annoyed with her gregarious nature and perhaps wanted to shove her off the dais!!!!  She was like an actress, filled with motions and face contortions!  My friend has her Master's in sign language (not joking) and she said all that over-acting was not necessary (I called her for verification!!!). Deb, I am very, very glad those capitalistic punks did not get their \"gas plant\" stuffed in the middle of LI sound even moreso now!  Can you imagine?  No doubt if there was a leak they would never tell us and before you know, lumps on the neck etc..!  I can safely say that fighting them and winning was the best tag-team NY and CT have ever gotten involved with!

I was just talking to my niece last night (she is your age!) and she works as a CNA now while she is in school to become and RN.  She lives with her \"man\" and their 2 kids so she is short on time.  In any case, she told me that one of the most gratifying parts of her job, and that which used to scare the mess out of her, is being there and actually holding someone's hand as they are dying.  I was stunned to hear her say this.   She says she is no longer afraid of death because of the peace she sees in \"their\" eyes as they are getting close and finally pass.  She is absolutely sure she wants to be a hospice nurse.  Tex, with your excellent nature, I can see you comforting the sick and weary in a similar way.   I wish you both the very best and am grateful I know 2 such wonderful people going into nursing.  Ckptry will undoubtedly join you guys again someday also.  We need as many good people as we can get in that profession. Omaz: NO MORE PORT!!!!!  NO MORE HERCEPTIN!!!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!  I am very happy for you.  I still have a scar where that port was but I will take the scar over that thing!  The last foreign body related to bc is coming out in a few weeks as that TE will be removed.  I cannot wait.  I think the first thing I am going to do is itch that area!  I get these terrible itches, as those of you with TEs know, just perpetually feel like you can't scratch it.  I *hate* it!  So goodbye to foreign bodies sponsored by bc for both of us!  Sweeney: camping with 12 people under 8?!?!?   That is a closely held nightmare of mine!!!!  I hope you have a lovely weekend.   Lady: thanks for the well-wishes.   I hope there won't be any big events.  I have 2 netbooks and a notebook besides my desktop so I am charging up all 3 phones and 3 computers tomorrow in anticipation of NO electricity!  I will post pics so you all can be grateful you don't live in the Northeast this weekend! Calamtykel: Isnt' that a wicked trick of nature that you can run every day and have a yoga class kick your ass?!   I used to hate that when I would lift and do cardio and step etc... and the occassional pilates class would lay me out!   There is hardly any comprehensive crosstraining...I think it is impossible!  Have a good weekend- Happy trails, all and I hope you have as lovely a weekend as possible!     ",

That is something I would have definitely done at his age! One year living on the beach we had like 3 storms in a row and one which was a massive Nor'easter. Just like in the old days of the Mao dictatorship in China, we had this system where the police and/or fire dept could speak to us through speakers mounted on the phone polls. I am sure you have something similar on LI. In any case, my home was 2 story and this one night, rather late, I was looking down at the intersection where the beach was (about 20 feet from my house) and I could see what looked like the snow \"moving\" which petrified me. This, of course, meant the water was moving \"under\" the snow and ice, frosting as it were, and I stayed on the 2nd floor for quite a while thereafter! I remember hearing the powers that be barking to us over the loud speakers all night but myself and 90% of my neighbors stayed. What spooked me was the 90% was to the land side of me and I was the last house on the water side inhabited! I will be perfectly honest when I tell you that I despise the very notion of being in a shelter with a bunch of people during a storm AND the fact that there was only one that accepted animals, and that which filled up immediately, was a deal breaker for me. My thought was myself, my cat and dog could all go to the roof and hope for the best! During that winter storm I feel like I should have left but during a hurricane, I would have stayed in that house. I lived in a waterfront condo when I was in college and that place was built amazingly well and had a sea wall in front of it. That is a place where I would like to be to ride out this storm! Palatial view of the sound! BTW, thanks for being the \"break waters\" for CT, Deb! LI-you all are such good sports!!!!!!! Calamtykel: no evacuation for me yet. I live about 300 feet from a lake that is, right now, filled to the brim so that is definitely is going on vacation tomorrow! Also, about ¼ mile away is a huge, huge lake that this lake near me is a tributary of. I have not had a problem since I have been here but this is the first massive storm here also. My house is on a bit of a hill and I am the last house on a dead end. I think my house is probably the highest elevation in this neighborhood. I just hope Deb does a good job on LI of knocking down the storm so CT only gets a wind, rain and lights show!!!!!!! Kel, I am so glad your dd is ok. Geesh...you don't have too much luck, do you? I would have been devastated to think of having to go to the ER before a storm. Sad to say but a lot of people go to the ER during storms because there own dwellings are not safe in their estimations or they are homeless. More to this point, you might have been walking into a very busy situation at the ER. I am so glad she is ok and you don't have to go. Best of luck to you and Carolyn in NJ. I hope we are all going to be ok and NOT be without power too long. My last outing is this wake tonight and then I am in for the duration. Ckptry: I am sorry that my very juvenile sense of humor had me LMAO after I saw Christie telling people to \"get the hell of the beach now!!\" He is a hothead! His temperament reminds me of the \"Sopranos\" mentality! I hope you guys are ok. I think if I was younger I might like to surf in this weather! I know, crazy is as crazy does! Take care of yourselves and hope all is well for you and your family. To all of our Northeast readers and posters: MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU....and fill your bathtubs with water as soon as it all starts!",

MY PS is sooo busy I can't have the TE removed until late October I was kind of stunned when she said that. She is very popular, however, and so I understand. I am just disappointed I am looking at another 5 weeks...gadzooks! Ginger: No on the bmx and tamox question. I had a bmx and am still on tamox. They insist it is good for us even when we are boobless! As for 9/11, I want to go to the memorial in Manhattan, as friends from the city are encouraging me to do so but, to be honest, I am getting a little nervous about these terrorist threats. Who knows what they are up to and I have had enough of their nonsense to last me a life time. I think what I will do is before the Yankee game in a few weeks, my friend and I are going to go down there and check it out. I will post my pics. Sptmm: 1 ¼ boobs!!! It is so laughable that I have gotten very used to NO boobs!!!! As for me and my boobs, I am getting recon but no TEs. She is either going to use Brava OR we are going to do lipo and just create some boobs there! In fact, that is what she is doing this next surgery and I will have bedraggled DRAINS again! I guess those will be in for probably 6 weeks or so and then finally, finally I might be nearer to getting a date to have nipple recon and then, perhaps by my 42nd birthday in March (was 40 when I started this!), I will have headlights again!!!!! What will be very nice is after this next surgery, if all goes well, I will be able to get back to a working, normal life!!!! This will make me very happy. I am not the kind of woman who likes to sit around as only grapes ferment, not human beings! My value has NOT been increasing with this bc drama! I sure hope your surgery goes well. With us being so close to the Sound, you might want to get TEs at some point as they are built-in flotation devices and after that last hurricane, might not be a bad idea! I wish you the best. I hope they get clean margins and satisfy the need for going in again. Deb, I have been meaning to tell you also that you are not the only one who had to think about work and your health when considering bmx. I had the bmx for the exact same reasons you did not which is wanting to get back to a working life again and not have to take a bunch of time off etc... Unfortunately my plan did not go as well as your's! My intentions however were to get them lopped off and go on about my life. I never knew about the infection business and all that other mess. I am petrified I might get infected again....so scared. The PS mentioned it today. I have to be very, very careful this time. All I can say is it will be nice to have some boobs and never have to wear a bra again! Speaking of which, it has been a year and a half since I wore a bra. I was going through my dresser a few days ago and came upon that bra drawer!!! I started laughing and said \"you jokers are on your way to the trash!!!!!\" That felt good! I am really not a bra-burner but lugging those melons around in those bras is not something I ever enjoyed! Lady: are you going for recon with a PS? Just wondering. Some ladies on this site alerted me to the idea of tattoos! Some women actually get tattoos of nipples rather than recon. I will do recon with the PS. I hope you end up with a nice, new look! Well, the sandman is finally coming but he always has a fight with mother nature and then she turns up my heat and so it goes all night!!   The sandman vs. mother nature...it is a wicked battle!  Oh, I must give you all a good laugh!!  Tonight I took my sister to the cemetery and she was not happy with the way they seem to not be working correctly with the weeds around her late husband's headstone.  I offered to go back to the car and get my little travel tool box so we could clean up the grass etc... she had been kneeling down pulling weeds when I stepped in a hole and there went my toolbox and I wound up on my back, looking at the sky, laughing hysterically!!!  I had a fabulous fall!!!!  My sister was asking me what I was doing laying on the ground when, upon closer inspection, she realized I was laughing!!!!  I did not see that hole in the ground and I promise you all, that added to my glamorous spill!!!!!!!  Night all-",

My sister lives in a shoreline town where 25 beachfront homes were lost during the hurricane. I can only imagine the town was able to commission \"Ambrosia\" to play the Fall Festival because of how badly the hurricane damaged that town. They have been on tour this summer....I just can't believe they played on the town green!! Ckptry: I LOVED the concourse!!!!! In fact, I would get off the 4/5 at Fulton, go into WTC 7 (where Border's was), take the escalator down to the concourse and walk the concourse when I was working at Lehman as well as in WTC. I used to LIVE on \"The Beanery\" which was this coffee cart, last stop before you crossed the catwalk into WTC, and have their mocha coffee and like 10 chocolate covered espresso beans! This is what I called \"lunch\" in my NY days! I also loved, loved, loved walking out into WTC plaza after coming from WFC to head across to Century 21 to the 4/5. On some Fall nights it was just majestic. Beautiful purple skies and then the concert series in the summer in WTC plaza...always good stuff. I also miss watching the Yankees roll through the \"canyons\" from the catwalk into WFC. I have many, many memories in the entire lower Manhattan/Wall St area. My heart breaks thinking about it. We probably passed each other on more than one occasion! My family could not reach me either b/c of the cell phone problems and they all that I was in the north tower working for Oppenheimer that day. They thought I was dead. I worked in 1 WTC and briefly on a Merck project in 2 WTC. All of the years I worked I was in 1 WTC. I should have been in 1 WTC that day also. I know I was not spared so I could stay here and die from bc! I believe my purpose has not yet been recognized so, in long, I don't think I am scheduled to check out yet! There was such an energy down there, such a vitality....it sickens me what has happened. Ginger: thank you dear...I need it! I was watching a soldier on MSNBC talk about how he feels like he has no emotions because a close soldier friend had been killed right next to him and just at that moment he started bawling. He said he can't think about it, cry or show emotion because he will fall apart, as he was doing, and how he has to be strong and be a good example for the other soldiers. I kind of feel like if I think about that entire tragedy I could cry for hours and hours so I really, much like that soldier, just don't think about it much. For me it is better that way. Calamity and mommichelle: my father died of lung cancer and he kept telling me \"I have this cough I can't get rid of\" and a few weeks later we found out why. In any case, I have this dry cough that I can't get rid of these days and it bothers me because, as we all know, bc likes to spread to brain, bones, lungs and liver. I constantly dx myself for mets also. I don't think that will ever change. I even went to the eye doctor this past week and because a woman my best friend works with who had bc had it spread to her eye (not joking), I was paranoid to go to the eye doctor! It is an affliction we all have the dubious task of carrying with us every day. Lady: purple nipples?! Aren't you fancy, shmancy!!! The tattoos are pretty popular. I am glad your's are done. You must report back after the reveal! Well, time for me to hit the hay so the hot flashes can start! Every day is a blessing, all. We must make the most of each. Happy trails-",

I think I speak for us all when I say we truly love you also, Tex! I am glad you made some noise at that hospital! Please don't tell me you had to drive to that hospital 3 hours away to raise a ruckus, did you? I would be wicked pissed if that was the case. I hope your news is good tomorrow.  Please keep us posted. Rachel: I hope you avoid a root canal. My dentist was able to narrowly help me avoid one just before chemo started. I am taking a bunch of calcium also. This tooth thing bothers me. This afternoon, however, I got out my dental tools (I told you I was a dental flake!) and took a picture of where that tooth was. There was a filling of some silver sort in the middle and it later dawned on me, when I was working in World Trade I met a friend for lunch in the concourse (the large mall that was at the base of the WTC plaza). I was in great shape in NYC and mainly because I was always working out, did not eat a lot and drank a plenty!!!! In any case, I remember having salad that day and I remarked how hard the almonds were or something! It was not almonds at all but was a part of my tooth so perhaps all this chemo just worked that over b/c it looks like it fell out around this silver thing. In any case, I hope that all this stuff that is going on with me can be separately explained and has nothing to do with the big \"C!\" As for you, having gone through cancer twice, getting the silver out of your mouth perhaps for you was cosmetic but dental minds would argue they should come out anyway as there have been connections to those with alzheimers and cancer, I do believe. Get the silver out!!!! Better safe than sorry. Good luck to you tomorrow as well! Geesh...you and Tex have a big day tomorrow! I will be trying to get an appt to find out what the hell is going on with my chops tomorrow! I am so upset about that tooth but I am thinking the damage to that tooth was over a decade ago and I did not have a great dentist back then so it is probably just bad work that has to be fixed and I need to calm down and stop thinking everything is mets-related!!!! Texas: I think the only field with widespread incompetence outside the financial industry is dental. I am so not surprised that happened to your husband. He is lucky, in fact, that he found a decent civilian dentist. I love my dentist and although he is over an hour away, it is well worth the ride. That happens frequently, per my dentist, that crappy dentists don't clean cavity chambers out sufficiently and just fill it and rot will form right around it. Very bad business. Well, the Emmy's are on! One byproduct of this entire bc experience is that I have become a bit of a tube head!!!! OH..the other development tomorrow...I get my surgery date AND I go to the GP to find out about all these weirdo things going on with me. I cannot believe that happened to my tooth. If any of you are SNL fans, perhaps I can get a cameo on \"Appalachian ER\" with my back tooth in a shambles!!!!! To qualify, of course, I will need to open my head like a Pez dispenser so they can see the damage!!!!",

Omaz got me investigating last night and realized some things about tamox.  Since I started tamox I have been getting hate letters from the mail order pharmacy prescription drug coverage I have about filling with them instead of the local pharmacy.  Obviously this mail order business on drugs is heavily tilted in favor of the house and they can maximize their margins.  About 4 months ago I gave in and got it through them.  I just reordered therefore I had been on it 90 days, which is about how long tamox takes to come up in our systems.  It turns out there are a number of different companies manufacturing tamox because of the enormous market.   What's more is the allergic reactions many of us have are due to \"filling\" agents used in manufacturing.  My sense is I am getting the cheapest crap on the market through the mail order jokers and that could certainly be why, over these past few weeks, all of this stuff I am going through has reached critical mass because I just crossed the 3 month mark about 2 weeks ago.  I read on these boards something about \"Nolvalex\" but have yet to do more research.  I don't think I am allergic to tamox but rather this brand of tamox because I was fine for the first 3 months.  Adey: thanks for letting me know about your horses!!!  I guess this is the new frontier for us...! Wherria: yes, I agree with you that I need to start drinking something besides water.  I read last night something about \"bolus\" being caused by drinking too much/exclusively water.  Did not see that coming!   The only thing I like is water so I guess Pedialyte is in order.  I always forget about the value of Pedialyte. Good luck to you on the coming results.  I would have been a wreck making that call only to find out the news was redundant.  They have no idea what we go through.

He actually listens and when I told him I was feeling sick after eating, he decided to run a bunch of blood work and booked me for a sonogram of my abdominal region. In fact, he is the reason I have had any scans or tests since the end of chemo. If I tell him something is going on, he listens and takes action. He is a one-in-a- million. Redbox is a rental machine that is about the size of a soda machine. It costs $1 to rent and late fees are also $1!! It is a wonderful system! You get the movies for 1 day and they can be rented at any Redbox and returned to any Redbox. They actually have pretty current stuff and there are new releases every Tuesday. They email the new releases also. As for the banking, I was on vacation, out of the country, about 5 years ago when my annual debit for my gym, which was $650 at that time for \"World Gym\" came out of my account and they conveniently added a zero. I came home to a mess. Ever since, I don't allow any company to go into my account but rather direct the bank to pay them or I pay them directly myself. I learned my lesson from 2 debiting situations that had gone awry and I avoid it. I am just glad you caught that mess before they got more of your money. That is just awful.

My brother and his entire family are on Mac and my sister is ½ way there with her PC and IPhone but for me, I never went there. I am so old school with my MP3 purchases at Amazon! Well, I am going to use a nail brush on my arms!!!!! This poison sumac/ivy stuff is very, very itchy and it is driving me mad! I have not had stuff like this since I was a kid.

I found out the hard way I am not an \"implant\" person either but I do encourage you to consider Brava. Brava has worked with people as thin as 88 lbs so if they can harvest fat off of that person, most people will be able to do Brava recon! I just knew I wanted *some* boobs but had no affinity for the old, poisoned ones so as soon as they acted up, I got rid of them! That is a beautiful dress. Just fabulous. You should get yourself some replacement, small boobs and you will be all set! As for soy and bread, I don't really eat any bread, croissants, baguette, bagels, pitas etc... and, if I do, it is a low-carb pita. I do have wheat pasta which has soy lecithin but, again, I eat it rarely. I eat pasta once a week and I don't really use those pitas. Old London melba toast has soy lecithin as the last ingredient. I will eat those instead of crackers/bread. I will still have a bagel once in a while as I really like those. It is all in moderation. I think bc patients should have a \"card system\" for soy consumption each week to keep track but then, if anyone created that, it would be an admonition soy is the culprit in a lot of this! IN any case, the dietician at Yale said if \"soy/lecithin etc..\" are the last ingredient, don't worry about it having any affect. I seriously think vegan/vegetarian eating is NOT going to help bc patients at all but rather low/no carb is the way to go. I agree with the cardio oncologist that was on the news with Diane Sawyer last week. In my pre-bc life, meat was almost totally off the menu and I could eat carbs/carb-related products all day. It is a shame that what we are left with is eating gross animal protein but what the hell are you going to do? I know that to call my bc \"estrogen\" driven is basically calling it \"carb\" driven. The contractors are here again today...will write more later, girlies!",

One more thing on this movie business:  on my way back for NYC last weekend this girl started talking to my friend and I.   She was traveling from Fordham U.  She lived in Fairfield but was going to Bridgeport (a well known \"s\" hole in CT!) because her mom had recently opened up a dinner type of theater there.  It sounded really cool mainly because she serves wine and the film du jour that night?  ANIMAL HOUSE!   Now, I could easily dine and watch a classic but I am still uncertain about going into Bridgeport to do so.....!!!",

How are you feeling now?  Even though you are most likely better, several days of dysentery-like biological conditions must have left you doing clean-up in the form of ramping up nutrition and intake now.  Just wondering how you are doing with that and don't pull a \"Liz\" and not get some electrolytes back in you!

I understand, from that perspective, what you might be going through. At the time I had no clue what his story was. All I remember was coming home from the city (we both worked on Wall St) and we were on the bar car, already pretty buzzed from happy hours (!) and the bartender cut him off. He, in his terribly expensive suit and very good, previous football player physique, CLOCKED the bartender!!!!! He knocked him right out cold with one punch. I remember slowly backing away with some friends of our's as we were all stunned. I did break up with him after that and in subsequent conversations he revealed this bipolar dx and a lot about him made sense thereafter.  It was through that experience, however, that I am very familiar with the volatile and extreme highs and lows.  It is not easy, Whitney.      It can easily be as much a task to control the \"push\" desire and tone it down. Clearly I think you starting a running thread or joining a running thread would be great. If you start one let me know and I will support your thread even though I am not ready to start trying to run again as I will have drains again probably right through Christmas. You probably don't get \"YES\" which is the Yankee network but they have an excellent running show, normally aired on Saturdays, largely covering marathons, preparing for marathons and some associated topics like choosing running shoes. I am sure there are a lot of these programs out there but I do happen to like the YES show. You might want to join a running website. Managing ourselves in a large part of the battle! Tex: I would get a \"Grey's Anatomy\" type of book and study the spine. Find out what muscles you need to build up to negate that process. It is entirely feasible some lifting might just help you enough and certainly more than surgery. You are smart enough to know when to avoid a surgery, I am sure, but these back surgeons waters are equally as murky as the cancer tx waters. At least, with cancer, we know the waters are supposed to be murky whereas with back surgery, I don't know why they make such a mess of so many people. Lifting, my friend, lifting...that is where it is at. If your husband has a bench at your house, lying on your stomach with the bar on the floor at the head and slightly in front of the bench and simply pulling that up and down from the floor will strengthen your back immensely. I would go with light and long for lifting and help yourself before those jokers want to start with their knives. You are way too young and have been through way too much to be going into a back surgery situation. Do you feel anything weird in your spine? Is that why you had the MRI or was that just an ancillary finding? Proceed with the greatest of caution, woman! Well, I am in such a cleaning mood today! Organizing, cleaning and motivated at that! I am going to wash some curtains now! Good day, warriors-",

Wherria:  I found out what is.could be causing the dry nose thing: menopause decreasing the production of collagen and the decrease in its production plus the hormonal changes cause drying of mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and eye tissues among others.  I know you went through menopause already, some years back, but perhaps all you went through this past year has caused your body to revisit a \"menopause-like\" state?   It is possible.  In any case, I can thank tamoxifen for that as well!   I guess it is time for me to start singing that old song \"Born to be Alive\" again!   This will help me remember what is important....right!!!

Calamtykel: everyone is complaining of allergies these days.  Going from 75 last week to a wicked snowstorm today will do that to people.   I hope you get better soon.   Allergies are rough. Well, girls, all I can say is I am very, very, very happy I found a very talented female plastic surgeon who was able to take necessary steps without foreign bodies.  It is so nice to have a woman doing surgery.   In my heart of hearts I feel it is just nice because, of course, she has a better understanding than a man could ever.

Finally, I truly believe we are on the precipice of wonderful things taking place in reconstruction efforts and options.  I believe female PSs are going to be hugely instrumental in furthering our options as opposed to the same old, tired, toss-in-a-bag-of-water-and-sew-her-up thinking that has gone on just, and quite abysmally, far too long.  I am done...!  Now back to those vampires...! ",

Lady: ((((((HUGE HUGS)))))  I am so sorry for what you are going through and I just cannot believe that he walks, at this time, and in such an organized manner.   My father knew a really nice guy who as soon as he found out he had cancer his bitch bag wife left him.   My father was always so disgusted as to how someone could do that.   I am so sorry for you but you know, people have asked me how I can go through this alone and it is amazing etc... and, to be honest, I think it is wicked easier to go through it without a spouse/boyfriend than it would have been to go through it with someone because I was the only person I had to worry about each day and it was great. The bottom line is with a cancer dx, the newness wears off, the dx wears off, everyone falls back into their original roles and, I am sorry to say, men are needy.   They require a lot of attention and sex and all the other crap that goes along with their neediness and should their needs not get met, well, the world might as well be coming to an end.  Women are forever nurturing but who the heck nurtures us?   I saw my stepmother totally take care of my father in his final years and all I could think was who is going to do that for her?  Write yourself a new ticket and try desperately to not see this as an albatross but as a chance to get to know your post-cancer self without having to cater to someone else's needs while you do it.  Cater to yourself and wallow in that love, nurturing and caring you can now direct to the most important person in your life and that is YOU.  There is so much I can say but I really have to caution myself because I know the emotional toll this must be taking is quite enough.  Just remember, I care about you and my words come from a place of love and support.   Please, as you go through the 5 \"stages\" remember, there is a upside to anger.   It will come.  If you need anything, PM me....I am here. Ginger: sadly all you need are human beings to complicate things irreparably!    Money will make a huge mess but it is not a necessary component for muckiness!    Honestly, it sounds like you might really just need a break.  You devoted a lot of yourself to that cause, it seems, and one person is very incapacitated against the human tide of desperation our 3rd world countries present.   You might just be coming to terms with your own limitations.   I know how this feels...I used to think I changed in a phone booth as well!!!  You have been through a lot also with a physical move of at least 1000 miles across the country during a cancer battle all while you welcome your little love nugget, your granddaughter, into this world is an awful lot.   You are correct in that a period of pleasantness might be boring but it sure will be nice!  Relax, you surely have earned it. Well, it seems quite likely I have a clot in the left breast and will have to go to the OR next week so they can issue a \"cease and desist\" order to my blood clump!   Aside from that, the right drain seemed to have gotten infected but now it seems to be under control.  My only real problem these days is wicked sharp pains in my right thigh and now in my left thigh.  I am going to talk to my doc on Monday about this.  It might just be nerve upset somewhere along that highway in my body manifesting in my legs and after all I have been through, I am lacking worry about this facet of my journey! As for my boobs, she is a wicked talented surgeon.  I am so happy I found her and so happy that ckptry, with all her years at MSK, encouraged me to find a new PS.   That helped a lot and this PS is just wonderful PLUS every time I go to the office I actually \"see\" her and she is incredibly busy and popular...all good things.   I am also down to just one drain = YAY! That is it from here....waiting for the VNA!   I have a new VNA company also and they are much, much better than that last one!  Things are looking up. Good day, all-",

Ever since dx I get this feeling, only at night while lying in bed, that I am falling.  It stops shortly thereafter and does not make a lick of sense as I am not even sleeping when it happens.  In any case, that is nothing like night terrors.  You poor thing.  I feel bad for you. As for embroidery, I am so glad you are keeping up with the class.   Good for you :)  I went to a few church fairs this weekend in search of a handmade and embroidered xmas tree skirt, to no avail.  I will try again this weekend.  I am looking for something in particular. Lady: I hope you are doing ok.   Check in and give an update, woman!

In any case, there are 3 types of learning styles: auditory, visual and kinesthetic. It is really imperative you find out which kind you are. This link is a quiz and it will quickly help you figure out what type you are: http://www.youthink.com/quiz.cfm?action=go_detail&sub_action=take&obj_id=598 This link will explain the differences in learning strategies, there are more quizzes and it also gives tips on how to better learn depending on your style. http://www.learningrx.com/types-of-learning-styles-faq.htm Finally, I have always, always used flashcards and also, sad as it is to say, my freshman year in college we were required to take a study skills course and in that course I learned that no matter the association (sex, drinking, whatever..!) use it to help you remember information. That helped me when learning Chinese characters a lot! Japanese and Chinese were hard languages to learn, and although my Japanese is much better, I can read things written for Chinese (Japan and China share and alphabet), translate it into Japanese and understand it in that way. I would like to start studying Chinese again. In long, there are many ways and YOU CAN DO IT! The book is called \"Getting Stronger\" and the link for it is: http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Stronger-Weight-Training-Revised/dp/0936070242/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1321391896&sr=8-1 I know you are an educated online buyer but, just so you know, on Amazon where it says \"used $1.25\" do not hesitate to buy that for $1.25 plus S&H. There is nothing wrong with buying used on Amazon. I do it all the time, especially CDs. Ginger: if drinking would not ruin the liver and make us fat, gadzooks, I would be on that Irish potato wine all day! Yes, when I find those bars where one could reduce weight, I will let you know immediately! As for the rebuilding over my chest muscle, this meant a lot to me. Most PSs stuff the implant \"under\" the chest muscle, which is kind of important because it does protect it, but then if you lift weights, you are, in effect, asking your chest muscles to contract. Eventually this will most likely lead to rupture of the implant unless you never work out with more than 5 or 10 lbs. Women with implants still do workout, however. I just think they are very cautious and work very light. I promise you, I am confident Brava is the new frontier for recon. I seriously think it is because it is your own body fat, one incision and no foreign bodies. Sweeney: good to hear from you!  I am so glad you are back and safe.  That sounds like a very long and tiring trip.   Rest up and enjoy being home!  Man, I know when I read your itinerary, I could never take a travel job again!   In fact, I am hopeful for telecommuting!   Went to the onc for my 3 month which was actually a 5 month and they are going to keep me on tamox because at my age, the evil CYCLE could make a return, even though I have not had it for 16 months. In fact, they said because of my age it is most likely I will stay on tamox for the full 5 years and never go onto an aromatase inhibitor. That is ok because, like Deb and I were discussing a number of posts ago, I am on tamox and am doing ok except for the hot flashes. I would hate to make changes and then have more SEs etc... Just heated up some soup even though it is still like 65 degrees in CT today...it is weird, weird weather! ",

I don't know how I missed that...of course, as per usual, the \"Lost in Space\" theme plays on! Ginger: thank you so much for explaining the \"incident\" report. I will look into that today. Of course, TEs were never meant to be in the body for over a year but, having said that, circumstances change and I think they do need to know about those awful and terribly uncomfortable SEs from prolonged presence. Omaz: when I was on Wall St I wanted to start \"Stocks for the People\" in downtown Bridgeport, CT! If you know anything about CT, you know Bridgeport is a crime-ridden, rather dangerous city. It was my feeling, however, that if those that did not have much knew how to do a little bit more with the few dollars they did have, it would benefit them greatly. If I spoke to 10,000 and 10 heard me, I would be happy. Of course, as I was the only woman on the trading floor, the guys would say \"you are a freakin' loser, Liz, and you are going to get your dumb ass sprayed with bullets in freakin' Bridgeport!\" Of course, they were joking and I was also. I tell you this, though,  because I have that same passion about working out and \"teaching\" people what to do without having them go see these trainers that the \"average\" person does not need. My overzealous nature about delivering investment and weight-training info to the average so they can help themselves is important and, I must say, I do get a bit carried away!!!! Please, by all means, STOP ME if I am going into info-overload on the pages in the book and on lifting advice! I really don't want to scare you! To me, a broker is to investing as a personal trainer is to exercising; you will know when you get to the point where you need professional advice. My heart is in the right place but I might be a little too excited about these topics for your level of concern for lifting! I know you don't aim to be a power lifter in the Olympics!!! SPEAKING OF WORKING OUT, you all have to check out Kangoo Jumps! OMG, merry Christmas to me because I am getting those jokers! They are fantastic! My friend in the city has had them for a few months and he is just nuts! I could not imagine but they are absolutely amazing. Surely they are another fitness craze but if we have crazes every 18 months, and we latch on, it is actually kind of cool if you think about it because in our innovative world, we have a new workout to look forward to every 1 ½ to 2 years! I like it! It is threatening rain here today so I am going to finish a little kitchen project I started weeks ago. I will post more later. Happy trails, girls and may the force be with you! OMG..speaking of Star Wars, Herman Cain referred to Nancy Pelosi as Princess Pelosi recently and Jimmy Kimmel (I think...can't remember which comedian!) ran with that and said Herman was only referring to her new hairdo and they showed a clip of her with Princess Leia hair superimposed! It was hysterical!",

I am so happy for you! Best news I heard in a while. I think you can answer your own question and reassure yourself on that one. I think there is a brain fog with a lot of this crap that no medical professional can definitively speak about or help us to understand. It is not like it is a conspiracy but it takes so long to establish a trend line medically and then establishing something definitively is even longer than that. For this very reason I am glad we have each other! Makes us feel less nuts! Omaz: the foot thing sounds quite uncomfortable. I will tell you what I get in my feet since this all started: cramps. Actual cramps in my feet. Very odd.  Might you try a foot bath but put rocks in the bottom of it (serious) and roll your feet on the rocks while the jets do their water-rustling business!  It helped a friend who was having serious foot problems due to diabetes. For those of you in the Tri-State area, and for those that want to travel to Boston next summer, I am attempting to organize a tri-state group to go to the Boston Komen-for-the-Cure 3 Day Walk. I would love it if we could all do it. I will keep you all posted. I might do it through Twitter/FB or I might do it through this site or a combination of all 3. I will keep you posted. I am nothing short of addicted to Twitter and, more to this point, I follow a lot of bc organizations. One of them provided this link http://t.co/mpyK6CIg\" --twitter.com/WomensCancer/statu... about how soy is good to help avoid ovarian cancer yet, and we all now, a lot of bc (I don't know the numbers) are estrogen-fed and soy and estrogen go together like Laverne & Shirley! Seriously, though, there is so much convolusion. I wonder how much estrogen is the culprit in more of these cancers and in ways they don't even know about yet. In any case, thought you all might want to take a look. Good day, all! PS-to our \"viewers\"-if interested in doing the Boston walk, you can PM if interested. I am going to start a running list this month and hopefully have it all organized by January so we can get even more fired up and in training mode!",

Rachel: hockey is great...love the pic of your son!   Reminds me of my brother when he played pee wee.   Your hair looks good!  Nice photo.   I am not much for football but I do like hockey.  I go to the Whaler's once in a while in Hartford.   They are back...only 2nd season, however.  I think football is very barbaric but I do like hockey!  I guess b/c at least in hockey they wear so much gear and there is a lot of skill involved...lot of skill.   Calamtykel: holy shit!  I cannot believe they found that you have some esoteric blood condition that could have, when combined with Tamox, killed you.   I don't blame the docs etc... when they don't find stuff that is really weird; I do think they try their best and we all have radar for the lazy ones that we need to avoid but thank god you listen to your body.  What a mess that could have been.   There is no reason why women should not be pre-tested for this.   Very good point. I go for follow ups but I don't see the onc...I only see nurses.  They check my armpits and all that crap but I just don't see the onc anymore.   Ckptry: get up to the main campus and get in the neuropsych program.  Yeah, the bs with the staff acting like body guards...I know what you are talking about.   You are damn right they are getting well paid and don't worry about offending anyone.   You have to be your own advocate....have to be. Also, best wishes with Aidan.  You know, no pressure, but I still count on him to save the Nets!  Not my business but I don't blame Colum for stopping his meds.  I get nervous with how much med they so easily dole out to kids these days.  I understand a good portion is needed but still, I think some is just dished out.   It was not like this when I was a child either.  At least I was not on anything, nor were my brothers or sisters and it just did not seem there was ever recommendations for it and it did not seem that other kids were either.  I remember in high school there was a classroom for the \"wild ones\" but that was about it.  I still just don't think meds were so prevalent.   YOU ALL NEED TO GET ON TWITTER.  I am serious...there are so many updates, bc groups, announcements about developments, I follow Giuliana Rancic (Fashion Police) & was just dx'd.   There is also a well know reporter from NY circles that was recently dx'd.  You just connect in such a different way on Twitter.   IF anyone actually gets on, let me know and I will give you the short list of the bc entities etc...  What is also nice, and unlike FB, you don't have to just \"like\" a page and go to newsfeed to keep up with bc groups and developments.   You can also make lists on Twitter so you can put all the bc stuff in one list.   Well, just watched the Buble Holiday Special...he sounded great!  Very nice show.

I am enjoying this day, I will tell you all that and actually had a chance to take my bike out! So nice out. Texas: where are you?! I am concerned about you, woman! Sptmm: wowie!!!!! Some fantastic weather we are having!! I am so very glad I did not drag the 50 lb glass for the front door upstairs and put it in as the screen is still in the front storm door from summer and it is so nice to get some air in here in January! I just went to Lyman Orchards! I love that place. I also stopped by Powder Ridge to see how the NY firm that bought it is doing with it. Looks good and my favorite, little, quaint ski area in bucolic Middlefield is going to be open again next year!!!!! I cannot wait! It is nice to live within 10 minutes of a ski area! Calamtykel: let's face it: we have socialized med and it is called OVER-BILL the very well insured so we can afford the freebies! For this reason, these little joker bills should NOT be getting turned over at all on any cancer patients. I am sick and tired of being nickled and dimed by Yale who have already been paid over a ½ a million dollars...is that enough, jokers?! Geez...they have no compunction about sending out these little shit bills and for what? Didn't you all get fat enough already on me?! I despise it. They should accept their egregious amounts they get from the insurance companies and shut up. I am so tired of the entire medical industry at this point I hope to god I am no longer sick and I can't just stay the ___ away from it. All the ripping is no good for you either. You should not have to get yourself upset about all of this but if you are carbon-based, there is no way having something turned over to collections that was already paid is going to sit well with you and talking to those collection animals is a task in and of itself. I feel for you, woman. I am glad your arm feels better. Do your own measurements every week and just keep track yourself. It is easier that way and you can rest your head going forward if you have documented measurements and this happens again. You can always go back and reference. Wherria: good luck with the doctor this week. We all live in this constant state of concern over this mess. Eventually I think we hit rock bottom in that we no longer think we are dying and start living like we are not eventually. The philosophical point that every person, sick or not, is dying a little every day is valid but for us the conditioning has been immediate and the foreboding cumbersome. Here is to \"oh, I am not dying?! Great, let me start living again!\" in 2012! I need a head cleansing also. This disease messes with you no end. Everyone: I got a Homedics percussion massager for Christmas and glad I did as my left breast (in the loosest sense) likes to harden up b/c of circulation issues after fat grafting.  In any case, massage helps a lot.  Well, this thing is the best!  I think you should all get yourself one because I use it on my neck and arms, too!  I am sure we could all benefit in some way from this.  I also got a Massage Envy certificate and am looking forward to using that.  I do have 2 massages left at Yale I should take advantage of.  Massage Envy, although it is a chain, is nice.  I am impressed!!  CARPE DIEM!!!!!!! ",

      "Content": "Jan 9, 2012 05:41PM - edited Jan 9, 2012 05:47PM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors!   I hope everyone had a nice weekend.   It is 2012 and we need to rustle up some fun for ourselves at every chance so get out there and do what makes you happy! Sptmm: I actually pm'd ckptry asking for help and/or advice b/c when I called intake at MSK I spoke with a rather commodious (yes, seriously) woman and she was basically telling me if I was not \"in a cancerous state\" I was not allowed to go to MSK!!!!!!!! People are crazy! I know I can call around and find out what I can do. For now, however, I am looking forward to just relaxing and feeling cancer-free for a while. I honestly think what I might do is go to Houston to see my brother and skip off to Anderson at some point. For now I have to think about getting these darn boobs into a state of quasi symmetry and then get back to my life. One more surgery and then I put this all behind me. Time to move on! That is amazing it has already been a year since you started working out! Amazing. I recently got a heavy bag on the stand and a speed bag. I also got a bosu ball. I continue to add to my home gym! I really like it. Yes, there are definitely worse things you could be obsessed with! Deb, I so miss my tight, toned body from my body building days and working out is wonderful. It is one of the greatest things this world has to offer so you carry on with your wicked healthy addiction and I will see you on the cover of \"Shape!\" The weather was pretty nice today. I had dinner with my sister and although it is chilly tonight, we are so lucky to be having a nice mild winter so far. Last year was a killer. Calamtykel: the percussion massager I have is a \"Homedics\" which are a relatively inexpensive line. The person who gave it to me is cheap so I would have to say it definitely came in under $40! I am just being silly about the cheap part but, more to this point, this thing is an inexpensive wonder! Kel, that would be wicked cool if you were actually \"having\" feeling again and that is throwing you off! That would be the best! I hope that is their findings on Thursday. Boy, what a treat that would be! Actually regaining feeling could be making us feel sick!!! Thanks, cancer! That is great that you and your dh got some alone time! Good for both your souls! Texas: hell yes!!! DUI at noon still drunk from the night before!!!! WHOO HOOO!! I better get myself down to TX sooner, and perhaps permanently, as that is my kind of place!!!!! As for my pain, I find that Cabernet Sauvignon is making it go away!!!!!! BOTTOMS UP! If I have more cancer problems I am going to hike to Anderson most likely. It is my hope cancer stays away for a while and gives me some space! We need to share this body and it cannot be constantly monopolizing my cells, behaving in a desperate-for-attention manner! Cancer is so petulant, fretful it is not getting enough attention! This needs to be like a time share dammit! On the TMs, that is basically what the assistant onc (APRN!) told me. I guess they are just not that reliable and can cause concern but they way I understood it is taking them is good because it gives a baseline and then they can be taken again if there is suspicion of cancer. I don't know...sometimes my head swims with all we go through and have to keep track etc.. it is a lot. What is going on with this lice business? My friend had to take her daughter out of some private school for a week because they had to clean up the campus = lice problem. Do you remember getting checked in school w/the tongue depressors? Everyone had to go into the gym. I wonder if the schools are still doing that? Guys, my sis smokes and I love going to visit but when I get home I open my basement door and have to throw all of my clothes into the basement so as to get them in the washer asap. How can I tell her that smoking is killing me?! Calamtykel: good luck this Thursday and I hope all is well. Wherria: good luck with your appt this week.  I truly hope all is well. Mommichelle: happy surgery on the 13th and best of luck with your new boobs, woman! Finally, I am still jealous that you spent NYE in Cabo but alas I am getting over it, Rachel! Good to hear from you and good luck with your upcoming appointments. Wouldn't it be great for all of us to have a nice 2012? I have seen Pavarotti (the Garden), Bocelli (the Garden & Hartford Civic Center), The Rolling Stones (Hartford and Keith Richards kept falling off his chair and the first few times we, the audience, thought he died!), Metallica and Guns N' Roses (Meadowlands & Los Angeles) just to name a few and, yes, my musical interest is quite eclectic and these were fairly high end shows.  In any case, I was very happy to hear Van Halen is touring again and w/David Lee Roth but was rather dismayed to find out the tickets start at $150!!!  I don't think floor for Bocelli cost that!  *Start* at $150! My friend called me the dating machine was I was living /working in NY so I rarely paid for a concert ticket but seriously, $150?! I find that very high but I will probably pay anyway. I mean how can I possibly pass up listening to David Lee Roth sing \"Runnin with the Devil?!?!\" In any event, I am really looking forward to this very expensive concert! Going to Kelly Clarkson this week...she is great. Was excellent live on SNL Saturday night.  Ok, girlies, happy trails!",

They did a skit on SNL about the Mayan calendar and basically said the world is not going to end but the carver ran out of stone! It was funny. Well, my liver pain is moving to my back...good times! Calamtykel: On the percussion, surely a chiropractor would have a commercial grade. The one I have is good but it has no AC adaptor so it is just batteries and it seems like it \"eats\" batteries! I use it for maybe 20 minutes each night and I have gone through 4 batteries (takes 2) in 4 days!!!!!! Not good! So that is my first reco: get one that has a plug! I shopped on Amazon also. So glad your mammo was clear! That is great news. Geesh...what a scary thing to have to go through again. Texas: I definitely bleed a lot more than I ever did before this bc crap upon even the slightest cut. As for feeling, yes, I definitely have feeling back. In fact, I never lost it w/the node removal etc. The only thing I can say is the affected breast has less feeling than the prophylactic removed. Sptmm: my new addiction: Dr. Oz!!!! He is keeping me honest! In any case, he had this woman on who, w/some blue laser, was eradicating \"pouches\" non-surgically. It is like $2K for the zapping but she demonstrated it on a woman and she came back to say it worked. Perhaps Santa will bring you that! I can use my gym but I am so disgusted because in a month I am back in surgery. I will tell you this, however, I am making \"the most\" of my month. I am using it all! Also, I walked on my treadmill with Shape Ups a few days ago...that is a workout! Van Halen does have something new coming out and I have seen Clarkson and she is fantastic live! Dave Matthews is also good live and speaking of Matthews, my nephews like to accuse me of being a pot head because I like DM!!!!! I had no idea that was the connotation and now it has blossomed into me using my bc to score medical marijuana! I never smoked that stuff!! I play along with them, though, because they get a charge out of it! I am considering starting water aerobics also. I am so glad I don't have any implants because I like going from shower to pool, back to shower and into the sauna!! That is my favorite, esp in Winter, and my Xmas gift to myself this year: a sauna for my home!!!!! You all will never hear from me again! Lady: I am very concerned about your cute, little dogs!! I hope you are doing well. Wherria: please post the results of your appointment. Thinking of you. Well, hopefully all of our lumps and bumps will be benign, liver pains will fade and when the odd thing we used to call sensation comes back, we will be less alarmed one day! Well, girls, I am starting a series of power yawns!!! Good night all-",

      "Content": "Jan 14, 2012 05:00PM - edited Jan 15, 2012 06:01AM by 1WonderWoman Rachel: that is a cool idea for a party! In my pre-bc life I would head to the equator for 7-10 days last week in January and first few days of Feb. I don't love Jan/Feb. As for the financial end of being \"Born in the USA,\" I have been fine even with my reduced income and totally able to handle this myself but I still would have liked to spend that $40K in another way like on a vacation home! I would have liked to do anything but dump it in the \"survive cancer\" fireplace! OMG...am I getting ungrateful again?! I am going to slap myself and dish a good reminder about being grateful to be alive! I must just relish being alive and pray to cancer to take more money from me...now, please!!!!!! Adey: I will check out \"Role Models.\" Saw \"Water for Elephants\" tonight. That a very good movie. Lady: there is that old song by Bonnie Raitt \"I can't make you love me.\" I have been on the receiving end of love that I have wanted nothing to do with on more than one occasion and I have also loved someone who did not love me back. It is all a mystery but my problem with your spouse is his timing: that was wrong. Love must be seperated from \"humane treatment\" of another human being and in this way he has faltered horribly. I really think you are lucky cancer tested the strength of your relationship because now you can move on. How awful it would be if it were never tested in such a way and you had to find out in other, far worse ways, he could not be trusted to do the right thing. There are nice guys out there and when you are ready, take a ballroom dance class or something. You will meet someone. My mother had a woman that worked for her for years. She was very attractive and had been in banking for years. She worked for my mother PT for extra income and she was a very fun lady. She told me one day \"Lizzy, my first one was a drunk whore and my second was a whore, I am not going for #3!\" She used to tell me how firmly she drew the line with her \"companion\" and, for instance, one day when he came to pick her up he said her hair looked nice and she said \"Don't start, we are just friends going to a movie and don't get any ideas or I can get right back out of this car!!!!\" She was hysterical and I loved her so. She was so interesting. I don't think some are luckier than others in love but it is just that some like the taste of shit better than others!!!! My friend Mary who I call \"wild eyed crazy Mary\" just got divorced last year. She was a woman who really needed to be divorced as she loved to get out and party and play with me! We had a lot of fun with the boys! She is a lot of fun to party with. My friend Teresa, who I worked with in Manhattan, lived in Greenwich and had been recently married. All we did was head to midtown to party night after night until one night she broke down in a drunken stupor telling me don't ever get married, I hate going home, my life sucks and I am bored and then started blubbering more about him wanting children and then she really fell apart. She felt that children were the shackles used to bind women. A lot of people would agree with her. I tell you all of this because the caliber of love one person can give to another also varies. Teresa and Mary, albeit without sick husbands, were not capable of giving their husbands the equivalent of the love they were getting. They had to leave but I don't think either would have left if their husband's were sick. Some are more emotionally incapacitated than others but I think that any man or woman that can turn and walk away on a spouse in a double cancer battle is a total piece of shit and although you may romanticize the high points, someday you will realize it was a total blessing his true colors came out. I am sorry to come out strongly but I can't stand anyone that could dump on someone in a situation like your's. That is a sick person. As for more sick men stories, my sister's BIL who gave the woman he was living with no support during her Stage III lymphoma battle (and she finally kicked him out of her 1/2 mil home) I find out today is a NURSE! Can you believe this poor excuse for a human being, my sister's cold BIL, is a nurse? Some things are incomprehensible. There are a lot of great guys out there...go out and find yourself one and don't waste another 2 seconds even thinking about this one. Someone else deserves your love and you need to find that person. Ok, back to tv/movies: does anyone watch \"It Is Always Sunny in Philadelphia?\" That is some good comedy! If you all have not seen it, check it out. Tomorrow I am going to put up my \"countdown to Spring training\" calendar!!!!!!!!!! GOOD TIMES! I am going to hop to FL to check out my Yanks during training and then I am going to hop to Yankee stadium to swap out my rain day tickets from last season's rain fest in September when I had slammin' seats for the BoSox v Yanks....I will not get seats like that on a swap but I will cry if I get junk! Goodnight, girls! Abraham Lincoln: It is not the years in your life that count---it's the life in your years Diagnosis: 4/16/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIb, Grade 2, 2/18  nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-",

Ginger: I wanted to watch \"Moneyball\" last night!!!!!  Great movie!  So I braved the RedBox in 5 degree weather and the kid at the adjacent RedBox was wearing SHORTS and a sweat shirt!   Texas: that same guy I told Ginger about from the Bronx lived in Throg's Neck. He was born and raised in the Bronx, Irish, nearly went pro football and dreamed of playing for the sad sac, Jets! In any case, one day he and I were driving through the Bronx and I saw a guy kicking a dog. We were at a stop light and I jumped out of the truck, ran over to him and was screaming for him to stop and then I pushed him. Eddie was 2 seconds behind me b/c he knew where I was going. The guy thought he was going to start with me until he saw Eddie! Eddie took the dog from him and that was that. He had a spiked collar on that dog turned inward. If I can't see a animal treated inhumanely (which I cannot and will not), there is no way I would not have been an abolitionist. In fact, if these here souls are recycled, I very well may have been. Only thing is I would have done differently is franchised the likes of \"Fried Green Tomatoes!!!\" I think we needed more of those types of venues in the South! My best friend is African American and he lives in Manhattan. Went to Utica and the whole 9 and do you know what my friend tells me? \"Elizabeth, I won't come to see you in Connecticut as I will be reminded I am black.\" That is sick. I did not know when I read the \"Gettysburg Address\" in 5th grade or when I was on the \"Sally Jesse Raphael\" show at 17 and declared in response to her ratings-seeking, racially motivated programming that day, \"that we all bleed red so let's stop this madness\" that I was well on my way to becoming they woman I am today. No, I will not be watching any \"Help\" movies. I think that entire disaster has to be relegated to the dust bin of history and left there. I would, however, welcome more movies about the Tuskegee Airmen, Frederick Douglas, The Amistad Mutiny, the Harper's Ferry attack and how it had much to do with the starting of the Civil War 2 years later etc... There is a lot of stuff to write about our history but I feel much like \"Pan Am\" served to attempt to resuscitate the \"would you like some T or A, sir?\" mentality of a time all women wish to forget, that film falls the same way for me. Getting back to Eddie, he used to ask me before we went out \"Is it ok if I take the car instead of the SUV?\" because we were in the SUV the day of the \"dog\" incident and there was a dog fence in the back which was convenient! His mother's dog was wicked rambunctious so he would keep her in the back until out of city traffic.  He also used to offer a blindfold as a joke! He still has that dog today. The spikes were dug so deep in his neck he had to undergo 2 surgeries. I am lucky we did not get killed/shot etc.. that day but you know what? Everything happens for a reason and as all those other a__holes stayed in their car watching this happen, I got out, immediately so I think if god puts people in your path for a reason, then I was put in that dog's path that day to help him. Eddie was also not just any Irish guy from the Bronx so that helped!  McRat! I never eat their food.  It has been over 20 years since I had a fast food burger but I will tell you, I love that side salad on the dollar menu!  Works out perfect for me!  The side salad is what brought me back!  Also, and with a good buzz, fries are important a few times a year!  My nephew asked me to go for him the other night.  He wanted 2 double cheeseburgers and a small fry...it only cost 3.98 or about a tank of gas in Connecticut!!!!!! Less than $4?!   That is uber cheap.   Good day, girls, and if you all have a vaca day today (which you SHOULD!) enjoy!  ",

My father wanted to die at home but that thing he married wanted him to go to hospice.  I was the last person he ever spoke to.  I told him to stay at home. He was so scared, it was awful seeing my dad like that.  I miss him so much.  I miss my mom equally as much.  A lot of loss.  In any case, Tex, I am glad you got there to see him especially because he was asking for you.  It is wonderful that you went to spend some time with him.  Thankfully, for my dad, by the time the ambulance got there to take him to hospice he was already losing consciousness.  He never regained any consciousness when he got to hospice and he passed within a few hours of arriving there.  I think it is much nicer to pass in your own home.  I hope your dad is comfortable tonight. More loss this evening with the passing of the amazing, enormously talented Whitney Houston.  I have been crying on and off for hours.  I have her debut album on vinyl and she shaped the mentality of so many young women.  Even the lyrics to \"Greatest Love\" gave inspiration to every teenager with 2 ears in the 80s.  Geesh...it is such a big loss.  These drugs are terrible and although it is not confirmed that her passing was due to drugs, as of now it seems like that might be the case.  It is just so sad.  I loved her music, I grew up on it.  Sad times for us here in this country as we are losing artists who have shaped generations.  Ugh...what a night. ",

Side effects include mild stomach distress and anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction). Flaxseed is likely safe for women with estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer, although its benefits have not been proven in clinical studies. There is more but I can't find my links right now.  Basically the flaxseed can fight against tamoxifen b/c it is sort of like a synthetic estrogen in our system so it does all the same things as estrogen and it basically skips right by the tamoxifen electronic fencing!  At least that is my understanding.   Geesh...we really do need to put together a Broadway production that breaks down all the \"stuff\" people need to know and remember about bc!!!  Honestly, if you are using it, probably not to worry.

I don't blame you for asking them to leave or get up and leave yourself. After what we have been through, I would be more vociferous now. Also, in Japan, many wear those \"surgical\" masks when sick and/or to avoid maximum germ exposure. I am not above wearing those masks now.

The generic ZPacks have some writing on the back foil but I just started at the wrong end because I missed the little arrow. To be honest, and I know how ZPacks work, I was not even looking for the \"start\" point. It is so sad! Lady: after WWII, the hegemonic nature of our country at that time was palpable. We had to feed all these troops and then they started reproducing! The government decided to start feeding the nation carbs, thus sugar. I firmly believe that is one of the main reasons why there is so much cancer.  Our parents just went along with the spirit of the times in allowing us to eat those cereals etc... Cancer and sugar go hand-in-hand and as they just allow these meat factories to blow up these animals with all types of crap to make them fatter and fatter so they can make more and more money, it left people like me in carb central. They can't poison a box of pasta. Now, of course well all know there are good and bad carbs but the bottom line is the freakin' meat was not so laced with carcinogenic matter, we might eat more of it and reduce the number of cancer cases in this country. Carbs are not so much luscious as they are safe from attack but then that very trend is exacerbating the number of cancer cases. I don't know why she swallowed the fly!!!!!! I hope you are ok in tornado alley! My friend moved to TN a few years back. To people in the northeast, the entire Midwest is tornado alley. She was correcting me today explaining there are actually \"tornado alleys\" and she is living in between 2 of them! Ok...whatever!!!! Bottom line is CNN reports widespread devastation and to this I respond by calling friends in TN, MN, WY and TX. During this conversation she is trying to encourage me to move there!!!!!!!!!!! I was actually calling to make sure she was still alive! KENNELS! Definitely kennels, preferably with you in the closet. These are portable, indoor kennels, correct? I can't imagine you thinking of leaving those little dogs in an outdoor kennel! You will have no control over them if forbid one does hit so they are safest in indoor kennels, with you, and with pillows and prayers! Ginger: on Idol, I never watched, ever, before Steven Tyler joined the panel. As far as I was concerned why were a bunch of no-talent hacks passing judgment?! Now the panel actually is replete with talent and I think the show now warrants more viewership. For this reason, I am hooked but also for this reason, I cannot let you know if I thought this was a good elimination v others! Sorry. It sure is shaping up to be good! Now that train wreck DWTS starts this week! The entertainment is wonderful! Sptmm: feeling good, like I left the flu behind me! Off to the OR next week!  Beer would ruin your figure...definitely.  When I was very into working out, I would have rum or vodka w/diet coke.  Of course drink D Coke anymore b/c of the phenylketoneurics so now, should I revisit those low-carb treats, it would be w/soda and lime!   I am busy today and it is also BASEBALL season! Pre-season has begun and my Yankees are looking good! Have a good weekend, all",

Ladyinbama: thinking of you! Hope you are doing well. Calamtykel: I am \"Italian\" so rabe has been in my life since birth!!! Funny that you mention Shop Rite. I used to only trust S&S chicken cutlets and then I saw all the Tyson boxes in the back of their meat counter and I knew it is Tyson chicken and not from this S&S farm I conjured up! Then I went on to \"Nature's Pride\" but b/c S&S is run by a behemoth co, I am sure that is just toxin-filled Tyson cutlets repackaged. I was just talking to a friend about Shop Rite and how they are locally owned and therefore our chances of being able to count on what they \"report\" on their labels is clearly a bit more than the S&S's of the world. I started ordering free-range cutlets as I don't really trust WF either as they have been investigated repeatedly to LYING to the public about where they are buying their food. A few times recently they have been investigated for their products being manufactured in China. China organic probably means just dragged through crap only once! Like I said, I am glad the farmers markets are open again and I can't stand the meat industry in this country. I have not even seen \"Hunger Games\" yet but I believe that is where we are headed because this planet has been all but trashed. I am glad you found something of interest in the meat dept at Shop Rite, however! I went out with this guy that was ridiculously wealthy and yet he shopped at Shop Rite (insert many jokes!) all the time. Of course I asked why and he just shrugged and said the produce was good. It got me thinking and honestly I think there stuff is more fresh/locally grown. I shop there once in a while as their sales are very good. I really feel for you on the foot business. I hated being taken down by injuries and it happened at least 3 or 4 times and then I taught Step and had a recurring gastroc injury. Every now and again it would tremble as if it were threatening to pull right off the bone! Not good. Congrats on the kale! I just pick it up at S&S. It is a financial as well as nutritional bargain. Omaz: I picked up rainbow charred and it is luscious. It speaks to my dirt craving even more than the kale!!!!!!! I am so sorry to admit I still get the desire to eat dirt when I open a bag of soil!!!!! No, I have never talked to a doc about it and my parents dragged me to the doc as a kid b/c the cats were using my beautiful, palatial sandbox that I was eating sand out of!!!!! They ran some tests but did not come up with anything. That chard is luscious! I make a big salad out of kale, chard, boston and red lettuce, red pepper and some shredded carrots. Good stuff. TEX: make that appt yet?!  ;) Did you all hear the Senator from TX crying about the job losses that are coming because the \"pink slime\" plants are closing?! Seriously? They cry about Medicare costs meanwhile they are double-dealing with the pharmas to toss the whole country on meds, profiteering of the stock trading, and then feeding us poison food. This country is a hot mess. I want to run again. I am giving myself a year to get back in running form. I really want to run and feel that great sweat of burning squeezing all that crap out of my muscles! It felt to really, really sweat. Funny the things you miss! Guys, my liver still hurts....wth?!?!

Below are 5 foods to eat that can prevent cancer growth: 1. Bok Choy This type of Chinese cabbage contains brassinin; a powerful cancer-fighter, also found in broccoli, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Bok Choy should be eaten 3 times a week, in 1/2 cup servings to obtain its full benefits. 2. Cooked Tomatoes have more cancer-fighting properties than raw tomatoes. Both contain the molecule lycopene, but heating the tomato changes its chemical structure and makes the benefits more readily available to your body. You should eat 2-3 (1/2 cup) servings of cooked tomatoes a week. 3. Flounder This fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids and low in mercury. Three 6-ounce servings a week is ideal. 4. Strawberries The antioxidants in this berry help fight cancers. You should eat 1 cup a day, including the juice. 5. Artichokes contain 3 different cancer-fighting molecules. Enjoy ¼ cup of hearts per day. All things to consider.  Most of us probably eat 3 or 4 of these anyway.  I think it is a helpful, little list.  I really love the idea of \"starving\" cancer!   Calamtykel: It is scary to think of how long people in this country have been eating \"pink slime.\" I would guesstimate 80% of the population eats hamburgers and, from what the news is saying, they have been also eating pink slime. Yes, crying about job losses! Now they are \"touring\" the pink slime plants to show us how clean and seemingly innocuous they are!!!!!! I could care less because if I have eaten 10 hamburgers in the past 10 years, that is a lot. I stopped the red meat fast-food thing 25 years ago and around 20 years ago I took red meat off my menu completely. It is just so scary how much people have been tricked into letting their tongue make their nutritional choices and how all that special stuff beyond the tongue, like your organs, are trying desperately to both function, process this crappy food and keep individuals alive. That is a lot of work for the stomach and intestines. As for co-ops, there is one not too far from Yale. There are tons of farms around also. I am just pretty happy that the farmers markets are starting again. That rainbow chard is excellent! I can't believe how nicely it blends right into my salads. Also I believe eating chard and kale fresh and raw is the best way. Speaking of pasteurization, in Trudeau's book he talks a lot about staying away from pasteurized and homogenized dairy. Of course, the FDA has us believing we must eat pasteurized and homogenized or we surely will perish! It is absolutely wonderful that your kids will not eat McDonald's after watching \"Super Size Me.\" They will most likely have a longer life as a result. I really wish there was a way to start an \"organic\" chain restaurant but there really is not because the govt has all these farmers scrambling around under collective agreements, it would be impossible. Like you said, with the organic season of produce contracts, you get what they have. Because I am single, doing anything like that would not be cost-effective for me but I can drive around to the local organic farms in CT once a month and buy some items. The farmers markets are the best for these next 7 months, however. I dated an FBI agent for a while. I picked him up with my Chinese language skills!!!!! In any case, and I don't know if we were on assignment (!), he took me to China Town in NYC. We went deeper into ChinaTown than I had ever on my own largely because, and as you know, the battling between Little Italy and China Town not to mention the problems in China Town itself. Needless to say, prior to dating him, I remained touristy when I went through there. He and I went into some of the obscure areas where, and worse than on the main roads, chickens were just hanging with blood dripping out of them. Ostensibly this was not healthy as there were flies everywhere but there were also large cattle parts hanging...I could vomit. That and the story my Italian grandmother told me of how they would use the intestine skin of the pig to make sausage and then \"hang it\" over night from the beams in their house in Naples to dry are enough to induce vomiting with me!!!! Gross! So gross! Finally a friend of mine comes from a family who have been running farms upstate NY for over a century and when I asked if he would eat the potato skin, he said no!!! All farmers have a separate garden for their families to eat from as that which are pesticide free. I used to really like to eat the potato skin when I had a baked potato. To be honest, I can't even remember the last time I had a potato now ! I am really glad you got to see your grandfather, Kel. That was important. Well, warriors, it is freezing in CT and I am going to do yoga and read! I can't think of a better way to spend my Saturday! Good weekend to all and, as always, MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!",

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2012 05:12AM - edited Apr 4, 2012 05:16AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! I hope everyone is doing well. Calamtykel: That is a great idea about watering down the juice. In fact, I think what I am going to do is \"shots\" of bok choy juice as is done with wheat grass in restaurants. I can follow that shot with lemon and sugar as I would a shot of Citron and all will be well!!!!!!!! As for dressing, I like Ken's Lite Rasp/Walnut vinaigrette. More to this point, however, I like using the Good Seasons herb packets w/ ¾ balsamic and ¼ olive oil in the cruet. I like that much better. A lot of the time I don't use dressing at all. In lieu of dressing I will add sunflower seeds. Hair is down to shoulders when wet but just the back. I can do the smallest of ponytails in the back also. I guess these are things I had not tried! Bok choy, artichokes, flounder, strawberries and tomatoes (cooked) eaten in particular amounts have cancer \"starving\" properties as per Dr. Oz! I put the list and quantities a few posts ago. You can get bok choy at Stop and Shop, Shop Rite etc.... on the \"green\" wall in the produce section! A friend goes to Price Rite or some store like that and she showed me those big containers of organic salad she was getting for like $5. I guess I am going to go shopping with her and she belongs to one of those \"clubs\" also...I think it is Sam's. I like to load up on paper plates and plasticware at this time of the year and will check out the salad mixes. I can't believe your dh likes iceberg! It is such a waste...no nutritional value and not zing, no taste, nothing! Give me a bucket of arugula any day! As for over-dx and tx, I have long suspected that to be the case but, honestly, in the initial phases, I would rather get treated for something that might have been innocuous in the long term rather than under-treated for something that could turn lethal. What makes no sense to me is I have 3 friends all who have been dxd with skin cancer. The one who is getting txs is miserable. The other 2, one of whom has no insurance, are not getting treated at all. I just think, again, it comes back to our capitalistic healthcare system and the fact that there is so much money made in treating this disease, it is over-diagnosed. There is no bc in my family, and no cancer outside of my dad's smoke-induced lung cancer, and my sister has long felt b/c I have good health insurance, I was dxd as a way for the place that found it to make money. I know that seems sinister but sometimes I wonder. If we had true socialized med, I guarantee the dxing is going to go way, way down. Unfortunately, like everything else in this country, it is always about money, all of the time. Honestly, in a strange way bc has been liberating for me.  Gone is the Liz that was overly concerned with working full-time at a company b/c of benefits.  Those days are gone but I am sure glad I had them when this happened. I have no plans to go back to a job to score healthcare b/c once they find out I have/had bc, I am most likely going to be fired. I have decided I am going to stay in business for myself and do \"temp\" work. I am going to buy the state insurance which is wicked expensive and absolutely sucks (no one wants to take it but the hospital will!) and in this way I am going to negate the possibility of being over-treated going forward. For me this is the only solution. I can't buy insurance in the open market and CT insurance is the only thing I can purchase. Honestly even if I went back to work FT, I would still keep my own insurance through CT and NOT take the employer plan b/c I don't need the employer getting wind of my bc. I hope Obama gets us some healthcare soon! Maybe his plan is not the best as it is my understanding people would have to have those \"bs\" policies where you can't make any claims but you need it so you don't get fined by the govt..?? Much like those basic car insurance policies that people purchase just so they don't get fined by the state or in trouble in a spot check but those that also have zero insurance properties to them. We have a problem in this country...a big one. Ginger: I juiced a head of bok choy and about 7 organic carrots and got about 2/3 of a quart of juice. Like Kel said, you don't drink these juices like you would a store-bought juice. They are powerful in small quantities. Your SIL is correct, in part, but you never really sit down and drink 8 oz of these types of juices. Like I said, shots are usually sufficient. I generally straighten my hair. The curliness is just way too much. I will say this hair is coming back thick, thick, thick! Speaking of Haiti, my bf in college was from Haiti. She had me go home with her one weekend to meet her mom. Her mother was the accidental entertainer, for sure! Keli would tell her how well she was doing in school and her mother would give her the \"dirtiest\" look and ask her \"but did you find a man?!!!!\" Keli and I would laugh hysterically and she would really start in on us! Keli used to tell her how she was going to become a doctor and her mother would again fly off the handle and declare \"I don't think your husband will like that!!!!!\" Things could not be more different at my house with my mother! Keli *loved* my mother! When we were leaving to go back to school one Sunday Keli told her mother, as we were walking out the door (which quickly became a run!), she had decided she was NEVER going to get married!!!!!!!! She ran out on the front lawn after us but because we had this planned, our bags were already in the car so all she could do is yell and shake her fist!!!! WE must have laughed for a half hour! Keli never did get married, btw! Well, I am freezing. I seriously think I am going to have to head to a warmer climate soon.  I just don't know about yearround heat but I think I can get used to it!  It is in the upper 50s today but I can't shake this cold! Have to go make my green tea and go watch my nutrition guru, Dr. Oz!  I only started watching him recently and I learn something new every single time I watch!   Good stuff!  ",

      "Content": "Apr 5, 2012 03:05AM - edited Apr 6, 2012 01:46AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! Hope everyone is doing well. You all will be happy to know the 65 degrees we are having today is agreeing with me much more than the 58 of yesterday! Calamtykel: this is the way I feel about healthcare and education which are the single two largest drains on the middle class currently. I know the govt sucks at managing welfare but, and unfortunately, there was never a map for emergence from that program. Education has an intrinsic map for emergence. The more educated the populace, the stronger our union. For this reason, I think they should develop a largely online, govt university where tuition is free. The exchange would be for public service for 2 years. Now, mind you, students could not arbitrarily choose \"liberal arts\" type of degrees. The offerings of such an institution would largely be anticipatory based on what suspected trends and needs are to emerge. In the event some \"on campus\" type of classes were necessary, students would travel to one of the 5 or 6 brick-and-mortar schools in the country. In this way the middle class, and students who are graduating with $100K plus in loans, could get an education, maybe not in their chosen field, but an education nonetheless. This would also strengthen our tax base by having an educated populace in place for emerging trends in the workforce. The middle can't handle egregious healthcare and education costs; eventually this will cripple the country as we are seeing now. Now neither of these plans is designed to stop those that wish to from dumping $50K per year at the Yales of this country but it is to offer middle class options. As for healthcare, the stress of trying to work for your benefits and survive is choking the middle anyway and that stress is exacerbating our collective lack of \"healthfulness.\" As for financing the school, if you have 1000s of people coming out of schools with targeted, skilled degree offerings, that is 2 years you can knock off the govt employment budget for those positions. Clearly they would have to pay something as people have to live but paying a civil engineer minimum wage for 2 years while they learn and work off their free education makes a whole lot of sense. The question looms how can Oxford be near free for most and Yale $50K per year? Our country has a lot of problems. I was at a party recently talking to a woman who put her daughter through Columbia and the daughter AND her NYU grad boyfriend are LIVING at her house!!!!! She does not really mind but was more speaking about it from the perspective of the gross economy and their massive loans. My last point on this topic: I have a friend who is a professional ( I don't tell any friends about this thread!) who is probably making $80K (non-coastal elite so= about $100K) and was not elig to buy a house, after 7 yrs in current employ, b/c this person's student loan debt was too high! Still owing $80K from school...it is disgusting. Omaz: thanks for the warning on the seeds! When one is juicing regularly it becomes natural to toss everything in the juicer! I just throw everything in, stems and all! I am jumping off my soapbox for the day now! Take care, girls!",

The little monsters were sitting in front of me!  That is a great idea if the little monsters are behind me going forward about the back issue thing!  Great idea-thanks! My mother said that about the become a secretary, nurse or have kids options in the 50s and 60s.  Not my gig!  I just did not, and do not, want kids.  What's more is the preponderance of my friends, and bear in mind I am living in a suburban location now, are not married and don't have kids.   About 25% of my friends have kids and/or are married.  I think our country is changing and no more is this ardent desire to raise kids and/or get married.  To me it was always an option and there was ZERO pressure from my parents about it either way.  In fact, truth be known, my father told me as much about a year before he died.  He pretty much said he knew early on I was not the dependent, take-care-of-me, stay-at-home, housewife type!   He also reminded me it is totally not all it is cracked up to be and with my frenetic nature, I should work to keep my life interesting and exciting and fun and to avoid making it anything else!  He was a very smart man.  My mother often times, and in so many words, told me I could do bad by myself so as much as an uninspired man might be of fleeting interest, marry lateral or up or don't marry at all!  Even if my parents were not so \"go architect your life and have a good time, kid\" as they were, I would have never succumbed to \"get married\" pressure.  It was on a long list of things that was not going to happen! Nowadays many women are feeling very free to say they don't want and are not going to have kids.  It is all changin and for this I am grateful.  Something else that is not my gig is looking at these 50 yr old, botoxed, teenagers!   Dr. Oz has those housewife jokers on today...there is a reason we get old = make room for the new batch of people!  I don't know why their faces loaded with botchulism?!  It is so gross and they don't look good.  I think the mirror, and their minds, are lying to them!",

I just saw my sister, step sister and a bunch of others getting married, having kids, being locked in a matrimonial prison and having to develop a palate for eating shit and being told what to do!!  Not my bag AT ALL! Who wants that? There would be almost no way I would EVER have stayed married b/c of \"the kids\" and I do not agree with the nanny or daycare idea as I think if you have them, you or your husband need to raise them, not strangers. That is pretty much it and the fact that I like having a career and freedom required I stay true to myself. Consequently you don't need to \"want\" something else to not want marriage and kids; you might just not want them. Also, in working in NY all I saw in my late 20s was men having a great, \"married-single\" time of it and their wives sequestered at home in the suburbs raising kids...um, HELL NO! I was NOT being relegated to a suburban prison while my husband went out having fun! On the flipside of that, I was dating a man who was working for ConEd for like 27 years. He started with the ConEd at 20 so by 45, which was 5 years away at that time, he was ready for retirement. All he wanted me to do was get married and have a kid and he told me he would retire and raise the child himself. I explained to him several times that if I considered doing this, he would largely be a single father as I would still be working and doing my thing. He was *fine* with that! Sadly I was not in love with him, however. Botchulism: I don't know what they are doing and why they, as housewives, are so concerned with all of this? I understand Hollywood men and women b/c their jobs depend on looking youthful which sucks (can't wait until Oprah buys Hollywood!), but I don't get these elderly teenagers-both men and women! I worked with a guy on Wall St whose face was totally immobilized!  It is really sad. Meg Ryan really seems to have had a botched job done on her lips. It is a travesty. Something tells me if you came along when I did, you would have figured it all out just fine! If you got a divorce, raised your kids, went to Jr College, embraced the female zeitgeist of the 70s, went to school with vets, architected a beautiful life which included selfless work in Haiti for many years, I am absolutely positive you would have been fine if you were born when I was!!! Just fine ;) Well, I must get back to the Yankees!!! Bottom of the 2nd and the Yanks are up 3!!!! WHOOO HOOOO!! A good weekend to all-",

Ginger: as for kale, surely it is an acquired taste. I already loved arugula. As the bitter greens go, it was easy for me to incorporate chard and kale. If you chop kale up into small pieces and add craisins as well as kale to your salad and perhaps try a raspberry walnut vinaigrette, might work. Clearly it is not imperative you have kale, however. It is a nutritional bargain, though, as it is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids which is a little-known fact. Good for you on the broccoli as sulforaphane and the molecules called isothiocyanates are mentioned as much with broccoli as they are with kale. They are all cruciferous vegetables! Here is a link for kale soup: http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-easy-kal-13802 Here is a kale smoothie recipe: Creamy Greens Smoothie This smoothie surprises everyone because it tastes so good. You really don't taste the kale at all. This is an excellent snack while breastfeeding because the greens help to increase milk production. Use nutritional yeast flakes fortified with vitamin B12. 1 cup pineapple-coconut juice 1 banana, sliced and frozen 2 to 3 kale leaves 2 teaspoons nutritional yeast flakes (optional) I am going to do more research on this today but I think eating it raw, as I do, is not the greatest catalyst for activating the anti-cancer properties. Some of the information I have read refers to moderate steaming to activate certain benefits. Perhaps I will start a kale blog! Good day, girls!",

This is a lot to go through. Keep your spirits up, keep laughing and hope for the best. It seems nowadays many of us are just coexisting with this disease. Let's hope the next batch of chemo puts this behind you. Any thought on going to CTCA? The top 20 cancer hospitals normally get the trials and are running them. Might want to skip off to CTCA. I know they will pay for your flight, in your case to OK and then, while you are in OK, I need you to hunt down Blake Shelton for me and somehow get a lock of his hair and his shirt...you can do it! Of course, that is how I am going to make my life-size \"Blake Shelton\" doll more realistic!!!!! I lay this task on you knowing that after some luscious chemo, you will be up for the task ;) Oh, Tex, better days and higher love are coming.

Omaz: U r such a joy!  You are always expressing how grateful you are to be on this thread and enjoying the support so I wanted to let you know that it is an absolute joy having you here!  Ladyinbama:  DRAIN-FREE!!!!!!!  Finally!  I am very happy for you.  Just this morning I was thinking how stunned and scared I was when I found out I had cancer and then how I was a total nervous wreck before surgery as I had not had a surgical procedure in 23 years.   Then I reflected on, just like you, the long time I had the drains in and then finallly getting those out.  What I did reflect on most, however, was the feeling of triumph and elation I have with successfully completing each level of this journey.  It is almost like Super Mario Brothers!  With each level comes more challenge and a greater feeling of accomplishment and well-being when it is OVER!  So glad you are closing the drains chapter and welcome to the chemo ride!!!! Sweeney: ROFLMAO!!!!!!   You poor thing!  We have bc, tough times, losing fur and trying to look a little good and maybe score a little flirt  from young Brad Pitt and that kid puts you on blast!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hysterical!  Well, sadly, you gave us all a laugh!!!! Wherria: I have no clue what precipitates your onc's interest in procrastinating on the lymph node ultrasound.  Especially an ultrasound because is perfectly non-invasive as a biopsy would be.   I think if I were you I would call and question why you would have to wait on an ultrasound.  There is no need for you to sit in wonderment...not when I look at my explaination of benefits from my insurance company, that is!   I have a lump on my leg and I have been getting wicked pains in my right thigh since surgery.   If I read too much I dx myself for bone mets.  It is hard not to pay attention to the lumps, bumps and pains now b/c bc makes us hyper-aware but, be that as it may, I don't think an ultrasound would be too much to ask.  Perhaps your onc might not be able to get it approved by your insurance b/c you are in chemo?  Let me know what happens and it was good to hear from you today. Sohardbnme: where did you go?  Have not heard from you in days...well I never...!!!!  Hope you are doing well. Roserx: I never heard anything about cold cap etc..  it is all new to me.  I am not sure, oddly enough, I would want to slow blood to my brain as chemo is designed to kill hiding \"c\" cells and, unfortunately, brain is the 2nd stop for bc mets, after lung cancer.   Certainly, though, the technology is out there and it is there for a reason so even though I perhaps would not do it and my onc at Yale said nothing about it, it is an interesting idea and I thank you for sharing it with us. So hard to believe this, too, shall pass...but it will!!!!!!  So put on your santa hats and your ugly wigs and get ready to party because, for must of us, chemo will be history by then!!!!!!!!!!  YEAH!!!!!!!!  Your FEARLESS Leader! the name convinces me! right....!",

As for cells, please, our body TOTALLY knows how to repair itself and it makes new cells constantly and for us that means HEALTHY cells.  Don't forget what else chemo could be doing away with as an added, albeit unknown, benefit.  Our body will give us new cells but it does not know how to handle invaders which is where chemo comes in.  I like to see it as a fresh start.  For all of those worried about healthy cells being killed, remember all those folks who have been dousing themselves with cell-killing narcotics, like heroine, for years and years and they are still trucking.  No, our situations are not the same but if Keith Richards is still alive after 40 years of sucking up every illicit drug he can get his paws on, I am only pretty sure we are going to be ok!!!!!!!!

In any case, how smart was he that he jumped into the passenger seat?!  He did not want to lose his license!  My friend would soundtrack this travesty with phrases like \"this does not look like the entrance to the highway!!!!!!!\"  and \"I thought this was the drive-thru!!!\"  In any event, thankfully nobody was hurt.   These poor elderly people are a wreck about losing their license.  At the rate this medical industrial complex is trying to take me out, I don't think I will see 90 (not that I wanted to!) but if I do, I am sure I won't want to give up my license either!!!!!

I remember holding his hand, walking around and talking to him.  I really did not know what to do but I wanted him reassured.  My BIL is still alive today, 12 years later.  It was tough to get the kids to understand, however.  I wish you well with that.

Calamtykel: speaking of weird, that guy was in full road rage.  I think it is best you did not contact the police because people that run that HOT are lunatics and, please I have police officers in my family, they all seem to know a cop and can get your information based on your plate like where you live.  I am just glad you were unharmed.   I remember being on this awful bridge in New Haven CT called the \"Q\" bridge.  It is a legendary span that takes 95 out to Rhode Island and shore points northeast.   It is very, very busy.  I had a similar situation and because I am a good driver and had a sports car at that time, I was able to lose him by almost flipping my car getting off an exit last minute.  I was shaking.  I was never so scared since a tractor trailer chased me on I95 in Bridgeport when I was in college.   In any case, I cut off the exit at the last second and he stopped, screaching his tires and put the pick up in reverse, on the highway access lane but could not do it and get far enough back to get off the exit.  Now, personally, I think he would have tried to harm me physically.  I am just glad you are ok and he was a very sick person as he jeopardized your kid's lives.  I am so sorry that happened to you. Wherria: It is sad to say but even best friends usually don't want the real answer to how are you.  I am sorry they even had to ask why you were not having such a good day.  How foolish.  Do you think she might have been preoccupied while talking to you?  It happened to me the other day and my friend Rich caught me off guard because, at an obvious point in the conversation when my reaction should have been all but certain, I came out with something stupid and off-topic which infuriated him.  I did not mean it and although I wanted to give him some time and talk with him, I did get distracted for a minute.  Just my little story of a similiar situation this week ;)   Rich later apologized stating he knows how much I have on my mind etc... which leads me to this... MY BONE SCAN...not so good.  The skull, which is where bc likes to go 25% of the time, shows several area of uptake on both sides.   My onc's PA asked if I had head trauma ever= yes, once when I was sled riding, about 12 years old, was flying down a double black diamond of a hill, replete with excellent dips (!) and, belly down on my little red flyer sled, smashed into a steel pole, head first.  It was one of those old steel poles, like 6\" in diameter, that ran behind a condo complex where people could set up a rope to hang out clothes.   I was unfamiliar with the area as I was visiting a friend and, because of the trees in the background, that dark gray steel pole just blended in with the trees behind it.  It was far too late to stop and I was screaming in pain.  I ran home, crying, dragging my sled with a few friends running behind me.  When I finally got home both of my eyes had filled with blood and my father raced me to the ER.  My head swelled up and, besides the bloody eyes, I think I was ok.  I don't know if because of my age that my skull was not through growing and perhaps I set a series of little fractures many years ago?  I dont' know.  I was also in a car accident where my friend Julia, in her old sleek camaro, broadsided an old lady at a blind spot intersection and when we crashed, as we were going so fast, my head hit the roof of the car as we had hit so hard the back of the car left the ground for a few seconds.   Aside from all of this, I have no clue if I have mets.  My onc is going to talk to the radiologist next week and they will get back to me Monday or Tuesday.  I asked his PA if they would move toward a biopsy and she said it is all too preliminary to tell but that she had not witnessed a situation like this turning into a biopsy?   Who knows?!?!? and I am still.....

I hope you do very well this weekend. Best of luck. Calamtykel: Omaz, and others, are correct in so many having such good results with taking Claritin before and after the Neulasta shot. I am sorry you are having so much difficulty with it. I hope Claritin helps for you and the SE's on the next shot are less. I am not sure who said it but the benefits of Neulasta far outweigh the SE's as any type of infection can quickly turn fatal while on chemo. Lisaattheshore: I don't blame you for electing chemo. I think it was the prudent choice. You are absolutely correct in that you most likely avoided 6 or 8 txs in a few years. Not an easy decision but I am sure I would have done the same thing had it not been forced on me!  For the record, on the August member list, every person on it posted on this thread.   The only person that simply PM'd me but never posted was Milnertm.  Not everyone posts but they like to read and feel like they are a part of the group.  If you put us all in an auditorium, like any other large group, some people are more vociferous than others.  For me it was important to create a \"group\" atmosphere without obligations of posting and people feeling if they did not post that they were not a part of this group.  I never looked at any other threads when I started this and I have a seen a few where every date is listed with a persons name and their type of chemo and # of txs etc... but it all looks so disorganized to me!!!!  In any case, we all seem pretty happy here so I guess something is working!!!!!

Not all radiation has the same effects. Not all radiation lasts the same length of time. And different kinds of radiation pose completely different degrees and kinds of hazards, as well as benefits. There is nuclear radiation that can generate electrical power to light our homes and power our computers, or that can be used (like it was in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan during World War II) to kill and injure millions of people. The sun is a source of radiation. Every day that we are in sunlight we are getting some radiation - a very small amount. In fact, that's what causes us to get a sunburn if we stay out in the sunlight for too long without sunscreen on. Radiation that comes from the sun is called \"cosmic radiation\". There is also radiation that comes from the earth - some areas more than others - called \"background radiation\". Every single one of us gets a very tiny amount of radiation exposure every day from background radiation. And we even have a very tiny amount of radiation that comes from inside us - all of us. You will get to learn more about radiation in science classes - particularly chemistry and physics classes. Basically there are 4 types of radiation (but lots and lots of radiation sources): Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and X-Rays. Alpha and Beta are called \"particle radiation\" because they emit little particles (kind of like dust particles). Gamma and X-Rays are called \"penetrating radiation\" because, unlike particle radiation, they travel as invisible beams and can penetrate through objects like buildings, trees, and human bodies. That is why doctors can use X-Rays to see inside our bodies and dentists can see inside our teeth to check for cavities. X-Rays pass through us, they don't stay inside us. But, even though they don't stay inside us, they still can change us on the inside as they pass through. That's why it's a good idea to not get any more X-Rays than are needed to help doctors diagnose us and treat us. The chest x-ray is the most commonly performed diagnostic x-ray examination. A radiologist (a doctor specifically trained to supervise and interpret radiology examinations) will analyze the images and then send a report to your primary care doctor. Your primary care doctor can give you the results of your X-ray examination and answer questions about it. X-rays taken to help diagnose what's going on inside us usually produce no side effects, but all radiation - even X-rays - if we get too much all at once or a little bit at a time for a very long time can cause cancer. Cancer is a word that means the tiny cells that make up our bodies get stirred up and get out of control and start growing in ways that they aren't suppose to. Lot's of things can cause cancer. People who smoke cigarettes are at higher risk for getting lung cancer. People who chew tobacco are at higher risk for oral (mouth) cancer. People who get a lot of sunburns or who are out in the sun all the time are at higher risk for skin cancer. A lot of the chemicals that we use around the house or in industrial processes cause cancer. So people that have to get more x-rays than other people should try to avoid as many of the other things that are known to cause cancer. You are to be commended for wanting to learn all you can about everything related to your health. The X-rays that you get are part of what helps your doctor take the very best care of you that he can. I'm sure he (or she) can answer any questions you have about X-rays and all the other aspects of your treatment. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Your FEARLESS Leader!",

I am sorry you are going through this.  I think your docs thought you were good to go and chemo decided differently.   Try not to get too worked up about this as your emotional state matters.",

Kimmie: the CT scan is because the bone scan showed several areas of uptake per the initial radiologist who read the results.   My onc was on vaca and, upon his return, he looked over the bone scan.  He felt, based on what he saw, my bone scan was average and would have been the same for most any human healthy skull. I think the radiologist might have been a recently-released student!  In any case, my onc was pretty sure it was nothing but just to be sure, he had me have a skull xray.  So many at Yale are getting to know me, I was familiar with the radiologist who did the skull xray on Weds.  I asked her if I could look at it.  Sure enough there was a spot in the back of my head that was about the size of a dime and was a darker \"white\" than the rest of the skull xray.  Right then it dawned on me something could be there and I was only pretty sure my onc would require more testing.  Sure enough, that spot, or so I assume, led him to require another scan, only this time a CT scan, of my head.  I don't know, from a doctor's perspective, what the difference is between seeing a bone scan, a skull xray and a CT scan of someone's skull but I can only assume, in this case, all 3 together will either make or break the case for skull mets.  I was so elated on Weds when he told me he really thought there was nothing to worry about.  Oh well....they are only doctors, not super human beings.   I will just have to see what the CT scan says. I appreciate everyone's support tonight.  It is so unlike me to crack under these circumstances but tonight was the night when I officially reached the point of true frustration. Have a great weekend all! Your (most of the time and now GLOWING) FEARLESS Leader!!!!",

Yeah, so we are a bunch of talkers...so what?! Who cares?! (this is Joy from the View that I am doing now!!!!!!!) This thread is \"THE BC VIEW!\" Ginger: the chin fur (as I tell my cat!) is often MOLE based! BTW, general good health is a great thing. We are being *treated* for cancer but cancer is not everything, it is just another thing. Good point! CKPTRY- I hope those uncomfortable mouth sores go away. Definitely call your onc. Do you know in med schools oncs are trained specifically to understand the emotional attachment and the challenge of treating patients for cancer with chemo? Call. Don't hesitate. They can call the rx in. SPTMM: Enjoy that shopping! You know what always made me crazy? In this part of the country, the Northeast, they roll out winter clothes and it is usually HOT until October so you end up wearing old clothes (or your new stuff and sweat!) for the first month to 6 weeks of school and then you get to wear the new stuff when the weather changes. I think all parents should do school clothes shopping in July for the first 6 weeks of school and then do another shopping in mid-October! Rachel: I totally forgot that no shaving thing to put on my list for things to be grateful for! Thanks for the reminder! I am so happy to skip waxings for a while! I never really had hair on my thighs at all and my pretty light on my calves. I do get hair but not too much. Well, goodbye to all of it for a while!!! Calamtykel: that is really cool what your friend did! Dinner sounds good. Lisa: I take/took pics of everything-boobs before and after, drains, scars and will definitely chronicle my baldness! Go for it. I intend to make a story board of sorts of all of this without graphic photos, of course! I don't think it is weird at all. Right now our situations are not comfortable but this is just another season in our lives and it warrants recording just like any other. Omaz: TWO genius ideas: first buying those soft lunch bags for icing is a great idea! That is a really good one. The other was going to ethnic stores for wigs and scarves. I got a beautiful wig at an ethnic store and I intend to go to another one in NY next week because some of those scarves are SO dressed up and ornate, they are beautiful. Texas: glad you are feeling better and LOL on the \u2018better the attic than the basement!!!!!!' Very funny! Also, I don't drink much but this entire process will cause anyone, as you said, to do something to get away!!!! Yes, I am enjoying my last few days! Also thanks for the franceluxe link. So many have mentioned it and I am finally going to check it out this week. Libray Lil: nearly every day I have that \"is this really happening\" moment. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and for ½ a second I think the whole thing was my mind going on vacation while I watch the inside of my eyelids and then it all comes flooding back!!!!! Iowa: the hair thing is a bummer but perhaps you will grow to like wearing some of the scarves, hats, wigs and OPTIONS we have now without hair. Hopefully we will never not have hair again but, for now, I am going to live it up. I am going to go bald some days, wear a wig, some of the scarves are beautiful, I have tons of baseball caps...I say enjoy it. I hope you find a little joy in having so many options that you can color coordinate with your clothing etc... I think it will be fun. I have a very good friend from India and she has always worn scarves and pretty, ornate head adornments...it can be really fun. I hope every is having a great weekend and enjoying this nice weather. Have a good day and do one good thing for yourselves today- 　",

I explained you say \"hi.\"  It is that simple.  A lot of people are phony anyway.  I remember one person from work saying she wanted to keep in touch etc.. and then never called. Finally when she wanted info on how I was doing, and I had been out of work about 3 months, she called with a string of excuses about who knows what!  I just did not even return the call as another friend from work said she was only calling to get the story so she could gossip!!  GREAT!  Just great! BTW, I called an extensions specialist today and she told me it is (nearly) impossible to use my own hair for extensions because they need to be sealed in protein etc... and that women and men who get them done domestically have to order the hair from abroad?!   I am not sure if she was talking crazy, trying to get me to make a wig out of my fur (that she could do!)...makes me wonder! Question for everyone: do you all see your oncs every chemo tx?  I was told today I am to see my onc, get tx and then back the next day, as we all know, for neulasta.  I was just wondering.  I am glad I will be seeing him each tx but was just wondering if that is protocol. BTW, Lady- I am having chemo teaching after my scan and tomorrow and will ask them that neulasta question.  I will post the answer when I get home. Have a good night all- Your FEARLESS Leader!",

On the hair, I went down to a hair academy this evening and posed the question.  The owner told me it is not possible because this machine that is needed to attach thread to the hair to allow it to be sewn in is not done in this country.   That is also a dreadful story about women in India selling their hair and then are castigated for making a fiscally prudent choice...as if they had options anyway.   I bet these women are wicked glad to see you!   How did you get involved in such an altruistic venture?  Just wondering.  Sometimes the stories of ebb and flow of another's life, and how we find our way to each place, is interesting. In any case, thanks for doing the work that you do-",

JSW: sorry you are having a little challenge this time.  All the breakfast drinks, vitamin water, gatorade and Boost should help.  I am so grateful for Boost.  The only thing I have been able to eat without issue is an egg, over HARD (everything must be cooked beyond recognition now!) on a pc of portuguese toast.  It is the oddest thing but at least I am getting that protein in.  I am off all the anti-emetics since Saturday and tomorrow is 1 week.  Chemo is doable but I don't see how I could do much outside of the house under these circumstances!   Dizzy not due to enough food: that happened to me last night and then I realized how little I had eaten.  With all the stuff in us I, too, was like which has dizzy as an SE...duh..hunger!  I was about to check my SE sheets! Taxotere: I have not had any of the issues with numb extremeties and, for now, my hair is still in.  I know by this Sunday that should be the end as that is the 12 day mark.  I have had a general feeling of uneasiness, fatigue, odors driving me crazy, nothing tasting right and just feel like a truck hit me but I think that is chemo in all it's collective glory! Eyelashes: last night I know some of them were coming out while I had dinner with my friend. I started blinking and he asked and I confirmed...my lashes are on their way out! Yoga: I do yoga but mainly at home.  For anyone interested, there are Living Arts discs that are 20 minute AM and PM yoga set.  I do the PM one all the time.  I like yoga at night and used to really love a super hot Bikram class in my now healthier days (who knew!?) Hard candy: the infusion nurse kept telling me hard candy etc.. for mouth sores etc.. (why don't they actually believe there are people that DO drink water?!) but I really don't like any hard candy.  What I did was bought orange slices (those jelly candy things), cut them and put them in a bowl in the freezer.  It works out great.  Just thought I would pass that along ;)",

She does something really weird: when I ride my recumbent bike, she gets dangerously close to athe pedals. I do believe she wants me to stop riding and I do have to slow down. He probably just thought you all could see him and wanted you to stop the truck. It was just an accident. I just feel so bad for you and Wherria, who had to experience the loss of a beloved pet, while already going through such a tough time. Just don't beat yourself up over this. You gave a poor, abused animal a nice, loving home and a good life. You did everything you could and the last thing you ever wanted to do was hurt your pup. I wish you some peace on this matter. It was not your fault. Don't be so hard on yourself. Calamtykel: I don't think you put a damper on the thread. I was just being lazy, laying on the couch reading the paper and watching Titanic! Kel, if you make a list of the 1000's upon 1000's of things you can die from, bc is only 1. The only things guaranteed are taxes and death. If you focus too much on trying to figure out what will claim you, and getting prepared for that end, it is like a dress rehearsal, into perpetuity, for a part you will never get to play. The chances are equally as good that you will live into your 80's. The problem with people who post is they are normally telling the bad stories. Unfortunately, during a nerve-wracking time going through cancer tx, those stories will stick with you. You are getting tx for your kids, your grandkids, your DH, your life, your love, your pursuit of happiness and ultimately because of hope. You can die a 1000 deaths but only one will kill you. We were not promised an eternal trip here. We are all going to expire. Focus on today and live in the present. Tomorrow may bring excellent news, a winning lottery ticket, a beautiful day and, if you are not prepared to let such good things into your life, you just might miss them. Focus on today and the fact that our cancer is treatable and that we will be ok. Emotional health is a big factor, however, and I think you have to caution against going through worst-case scenario odds. I'd would really feel like I wasted my time if I prepared myself to die from bc and start doing the countdown now only to live into my 80's and die of a heart attack ;) I think you get the idea!  Also, on the LN involvement, don't forget they are filters designed to trap and retain things in our system that don't belong.  I know a lot of people look upon LN involvement like it has definitely spread but I don't really agree.  I think the LNs were doing their job in catching it to begin with.   They are pretty efficient and because they caught it bodes well.   It will be ok if you allow it all to be ok. ",

I know this whole thing is scary.   Take it easy.   Try not to go for the \"worst case scenario\" calculator ;)    I promise you one thing: since this whole bc battle showed up in our lives, we all dragged that joker calculator out and absolutely give it way more power by keeping it very handy....or as you put it: GOOGLE!  No more googling!!!

We do have our challenges, don't we?!  the boobs and the hormones and the bc and now the fake boobs and infections and drugs and chemo and rads and super scary thoughts of recurrence and a general overall aversion, as women, to using public bathrooms and the baldness and the wigs....geez, Louise....what a road we have to travel!    I sure hope something great happens to all of us soon.  Alas, I digress!",

I asked them repeatedly what supplements I should take and they told me that my blood tells them everything they need to know and that is how they determine what I should take. My blood has been fine so I guess I don't need to take anything else. I do eat a lot of salmon and it is naturally occurring in salmon so perhaps that is why I have not been told to take a supplement. Certainly I don't think it can hurt ;) JSW and DebJ: appetite is a problem. I had a problem this first one and now for the 2nd I am planning to eat almonds, cottage cheese singles, Boost, egg whites....whatever is not too tasty! Everything tastes so weird.  I, however, am not done with this until the end of December so I put together a list of mini-meals I will force myself to have every 2 hours.  I am hoping it is going to work! Sptmm: Congratulations on being DONE!!!!!! You are SOOOO LUCKY!!!!!! You made it! I am very happy for you. Get through the next 10 and you are on your way to healthy freedom. Texas: I must tell you, your spirit is amazing! Just amazing. I love the fact that you just keep rolling along and enjoying your life. I love it! You are a marvel of sorts. I am not just sewing together vowels and consonants in an attempt to appease myself either! You are a wonderful woman....or WONDER WOMAN!!!!! That is how I conjugate wonderful woman! I think you need to dress up with the kids Halloween! BTW, love the new avatar...very cool pic for WONDER WOMAN!!! Calamtykel: I would have *never* dreamed fish oil in the capsules would need to be tested for mercury. Thank you so much for posting that. I will not forget the name \"Carlson's\" now. That was very helpful information. Either I never thought about where the oil in the capsule came from or I just assumed it was NOT a fish!!! Our food sources are questionable enough so I guess I rather hoped the stuff in the capsule was a non-food related miracle! Headaches: why am I getting these gross headaches a few days before tx #2!?! Ugh...I am sure it is stress. I do, however, have to go back to Yuckville on Tuesday! BTW, I *rarely* got headaches before chemo. Gross! HGTV: Josh from DIY(I think he is a crossover as he does \"House Crashers\" on HGTV) just cracked granite and then reapplied it around the fireplaces, putting all the pieces together like a puzzle with ¼ inch between each broken piece then they filled the cracks with some putty colored material for contrast and the black granite against that material...what a beautiful result with awesome contrast! I love this station! Remember to get out and enjoy this beautiful Fall day and do something good for yourselves....like smile in the mirror at yourself!!!  It works!!!!  Good day to all-",

Calamtykel: I am so sorry you have a cold. I am wicked scared of this flu season but I never got the flu shot in the past and I certainly don't plan to get it while on chemo. I have my next tx this Tuesday and will ask that question. I sure hope they don't advocate chemo patients getting it. I am even going as far as being very cautious about who I allow to come over these next 3 months as I am worried about kids and colds/flu etc... . I was supposed to travel to TN for Thanksgiving and upstate NY for Christmas but I don't think I will be doing either. I sure hope you feel better and get over this. You are absolutely correct about the flu being very dangerous on chemo. It is scary. I got the flu 2 years ago in 2008 and was so sick for 2 weeks. It was awful! Feel better. Lisaattheshore: did you ever get sick from the flu shot? I was just wondering as I know they did administer flu shots at my job and a number of people who received the shot did get sick albeit for a shorter period of time then they would normally if they had gotten the flu. OMG...I can't believe they were giving out flu shots to chemo patients! Holy smokes. That seems so antithetical. I think I will be skipping that if they offer. Ladyinbama: That occurred to me the other day, the hat and scarf thing, because I also noticed and indentation from my Yankee hat! Good luck on your first tax! Good luck to everyone getting txs this week. I have only JSW, Kimmie68 and Mmahle for October 8th and I am going on Oct 5th. Again, if I missed anyone, let me know. I hope you all had a good weekend and have a lovely night! Your FEARLESS Leader!",

I can't imagine having to take my 2 in the morning and evening the day before the day before and then 2 the morning of, which is my schedule, only to be told my blood was not appropriate to get chemo.   That is a rough crash to go through.  I don't feel so hot when I come off the decadron and I do seem to be able to catch up on some sleep but I think in your case, you are in the throws of a hard crash.  I wish I had more definitive advice to give you based on actual experience but I don't. You have every right to be concerned about your blood results and I would think some of that is playing into this for you.   Perhaps some of the other girls, when they rise (!), will be able to offer some more insight.   Also, on the headaches, we have all discussed them.  I think it might have to do with the stress of the entire experience and for you coming off of the decadron prematurely and in a harsh way at that certainly can exacerbate anything you might be feeling.  I hope you are doing better now but I do sense you might have another day of rough seas ahead.  Let me know how you are doing.  I wish I could be of more help. Chemo brain: Well, last night I put the remote control for my kitchen tv in the refrigerator!  I also left my keys at CVS, at the pharmacy of course.  Finally, I dropped my glasses in the kitchen and spent 2 hours looking for them.  Good times, indeed, good stuff!",

My breathing is affected when I do some things that would normally not have me huffing. I almost feel like I smoke when I am trying to do some basic things. Is this what was happening to you? For me it does seem to abate after the steroids but as this is just tx #2, and if this breathlessness is a taxotere SE, it is supposed to get worse with each tx. As of #3 I am only ½ way through so I am curious as to how far along you are, what caused them to decide you are allergic and what you were feeling also. An SE is just that but I don't want to be stuck with some breathing issue post chemo. On the sleep meds, I am going to skip it as I am only on roids for 5 days. I am afraid also with ambien (and the like) because they depress breathing and I am having enough concerns about that now. My breathing is totally fine when I am sedentary and if I ride my recumbent bike slowly, at a low resistance, I am ok but it is more like what everyone else here said with inclines and hills. I have incline on my tread and am thinking I need to condition myself rather than give in to this. So much to think about. Iowa: swelling is one of the things I believe you are supposed to call the onc about. In fact, I just checked my sheet and it is. You should call and at least let someone know. Kimmie: they talked to me (and a bunch of us on this thread I believe) about rads. I, like you, don't really want to do it but, unlike you, my sentinel was not encapsulated and I had 2 nodes affected. The bc had totally taken over my sentinel and there was no trace of node left...it was all bc. It also appears to have leaked into surrounding tissue. Who knows on the rads...I am not too happy about having to do both. I have not gone to an onc rad about that yet. I am not convinced I want to do it. Rachel: you sound like you have a lovely Thanksgiving day planned and it is the best kind: with your kids in your home. That is the way it should be As I keep whining, I was supposed to travel this year but will be staying at home also. I don't want any infections etc... through this coming holiday stretch and I won't finish until Dec 28!!! I was looking forward to going to see my good friend in Tennessee but alas I must sit still. I hope you had a lovely day. Wherria: did you go to the marathon? I hope you are feeling a little better now also. It is tough to deal with all that we are going through and the others around us. Truly a time of \"less is more\" when it comes to company!! I hope you are all doing well. I seem to be roid crashing but not too badly.",

As for the cough and your feelings in your chest, OTC drugs can mask and manage symptoms but don't get *rid* of anything.  Now that you are on an antibiotic, this is something I did last October when I got bronchitis so bad I was out of work for the first time in years with a sickness.  Of course a few months later I would find out I had bc which surely compromised my system but who knew?!!?  In any case, I had that nasty lingering, thick junk in my bronchial airways and I actually drank a lot of tea and, honestly, I sort of inverted my body a bit to get it OUT!   I would lay on my favorite reading chair with my legs over the back and my head on a slight downward trend due to pillows under my butt and would get it out.  I also bought a steamer (personal vaporizer really) and used the little vicks circles in the bottom before I  did my short inversion process.  It worked as I got it out but I only steamed it up and inverted for a few minutes each time.  I am glad you had some time with your daughter today.  It is important that she hear the real deal from you.   My Godson was here this weekend and he was talking to me about this.  He is such a love!  In any case, I did tell him no one promised anyone they would be here forever and that is why you make the most of each day.  It is so hard to talk to kids and be honest, however.   Tough stuff, woman!

I am seriously considering taking my remaining txs at another hospital where there is no parking drama.   Yale disassociates themselves from the drama by citing they don't run the garages but the city does.   Well they are the ones that are making $350,000 off of my disease so they better come up with a solution.   In long, you have power as a patient because they want your money.  Use it. LGFB: I finally went today!!!!!!!  Yeah!!!!!!!  More on the parking issue, during last week's fiasco one of the booth people swore at me and today, again, she called me an \"effing b!\"   More abuse in teh parking garage.  In any case, LGFB was very nice and fun.   I got a nice bag of cosmetics and met some nice people and it was fun and informative.   I very much enjoyed it and they gave me a wig, which I will return if I don't like it, that is short but certainly less attention-getting than the one I have.  I am going to try it out for a few days.   What a great program though.  I really enjoyed it. My employer: as you all know, I have been given a hard time by this HUGE company.  In a few weeks, I will reveal the name of the company that has been giving this bc patient a terrible time so you all know where and how to spend your money.  This HUMONGOUS employer has basically been threatening to fire me and been very inflexible almost since the day I was dxd.  I have been to an attorney twice and am going again soon.  In any case, what really drove home the caliber of awful organization they are is when today I was speaking with one of the American Cancer Society reps and she asked me what I do for a living etc..  When I told her who I work for she said \"say no more, their reputation totally proceeds them.  Did they try to fire you yet?\"  She went on to tell me a few things about awful stories from other cancer patients that were also employed by them.   She said they have a very bad reputation.  Nice, really nice.  I was a little embarrassed and unnerved to hear this.  Furthermore I made a mental note to get back to the attorney!   Texas: take a rest!!!!!!!  Walk-0-rama!!!!!!!  I think if you put a pink ribbon on it could have been a mini ACS march!!!!   I give you so much credit.

I have not done it since starting chemo but I have in the past. Good stuff. At least no more cipro, right?! Ginger: none of this stuff is easy to submit to. It is a rough road. I am glad you are able to alleviate some of the pain with meds. A visit from the baby must have helped you today. I hope you had a nice time with her.

Wherria:  I can't go to visit a loved one who is in a nursing home because they have MRSA.   While on chemo, and I know it is your best friend but, I would encourage you to skip visiting.   The hospital is just replete with germs as it is.  You really have to watch out for yourself.  I am sorry your friend is neutropenic and I hope she is coming along.  Maybe if you both are better you can go and see her next week?  As for Lymphedema, I have not heard of anyone on this thread talking about having it but there are threads dedicated to lymphedema on this site.   That might be a good resource for you.  On the muscle and weakness, a lot of us are there now   You are definitely not alone on that one.   Aside from all of what you are going through, I hope you have a restful weekend and feel better. Calamtykel: Like Wherria said, taxotere has been giving me the weakness, muscle pain, and I have had the fatigue for a while.   It is not constant but rather bad in the first 8-10 days after tx and then it subsides for a bit just in time to go back.  There is nothing easy about this but I will say, and concur with Wherria again, it is so much easier to deal with these tough times and try to erradicate it this time around than deal with mets and more txs in the future.   No guarantees but I am hopeful that full-force on this round will do it.  This is what I keep in mind when I think about the day-to-day stuff.  On pain meds, they make me sick as well.  I only took a few after my bmx.   I hope you get some rest today.

I was just getting neulasta post-chemo (final tx..so glad!) and was talking about this very same topic with a woman in the infusion room.   My mammo showed roughly 1cm and 2 months later, after bmx, it seems that 1cm grew to 2.5cm and I also had 3.5cm of DCIS.  I still believe, and all the medical peeps say no, that when the biopsy is performed they do wake up the cancer and it starts to get on the move.  That is the only thing I can think.   My mammo at 38 showed shadows but they were not sufficient enough for further investigation.   My second mammo, at 40, showed the 1cm and 2 months later it was 150% larger than it's mammo perceived size?   I do think that those of us with nominal findings on the mammo, with post-surgical much larger findings, have not necessarily been failed by the mammo system but rather the biopsy needle woke it up. Surely we will never know! ",

Calamtykel: WHAAA?!?!?   Wait to get it out and it might be infected?  Is it just me or are these people crazy?  You have to get that out NOW.  I don't understand such unorthodox advice.  Geez... they need to get that out of you.   Force them to pony up with an antibiotic now before it potentially gets worse.  I really feel for you.  You have so much verve and so many things to do, not to mention home-schooling nearly a basketball team, and you get some ridiculous nonsense guidance from these medical people that are supposed to be helping you?  I would de-mand some attention on this matter tomorrow before you end up with a bigger problem and you should not have to fight for attention on this matter.  Make sure they help you with this.  It is no joke that you are just finishing chemo and your body not being back up to par and an infection going on....they need to fix this.   Please let us know what is going on. Eyebrows and lashes: I did not fully lose my hair nor did I lose my lashes or brows.  I lost hair just about every other place and my hair just thinned.  I could not keep it long, however, as the stuff that was falling out was tangling in the longer stuff that was staying.   In retrospect I sort of wish I left it long and just wigged it up to cover the little bit I had left but, at the time, buzzing seemed to be the best idea.  I was also secretly looking forward to seeing what would come back but it never even left!   I am so grateful for these bula hats, I can't tell you!   DebJ: I cried twice since this started: once when the mammographer told me, in no uncertain terms, there was an anomalous mass in my chest and it must be biopsied immediately.  Her delivery was antithetical to any sort of professional etiquette.  In any case, time #2 was the morning I got the port put in...I was still getting the cycle and I got weepy.  I am hoping my third cry is going to be the day they take that joker port OUT!   I think Yale likes us to keep it for 1 year, however.   In any case, I am glad you are done.  The fatigue is outrageous, though.  Like I said yesterday, we are all in a sum-zero game in that the only we will generate is going to be exactly what we do generate and no more, no less.   Our reserve tanks are non-existent right now.  My heart breaks for you having to work.  There is no way I could work.  I slept away most of today, like 6 hours in 3-hour increments and not because I wanted to but because I had to.  It is also cold here and being under my blankets watching L&O as I drift off is not awful!!  In any case, best of luck to you. TE's: I don't love these things!  I am tired of having them in.  As it stands now with rads looming, I might not get them out until summer = gross!   I am starting to think no recon might have been better!  At least they would never get in the way in the gym again!   Oh well....that is my diatribe on TE's and general boob discomfort!  I hope you all have had a lovely day and are spirited and excited and singing your way through this holiday season!  If not, take out pics of your relatives and say all those luscious things you might want to tell them to their face and get it all out before they arrive!  It is good for the soul!!!! GOODNIGHT GIRLS!",

I understand being in a high-pressure arena where looks are everything but if they don't stop pandering to the idea that women don't get old and can't get old or they will be out of a job, especially the likes of those Judds who are all wicked talented, there is not much hope for the not-so-talented.  I think this is why the world loves Oprah.  She is a heavy woman...she tried to be thin but she is a heavy person.   She tried all the different looks but, in the end, she came right back to her original look which is true Oprah.   Barbara Walters, Whoopi, Joan Allen, Diane Keaton, Halle Berry...there is a bunch of women that don't appear to be avoiding the effects of time.  Those are women that are going to change the world.  After all, you can dress it up and put botchulism in it but there is no risk-free way to change the facts.  I hope more women stop embracing the plastic surgery movement and be free of it.  Calamtykel: I am so with you on the boobs.  I am so happy to have smaller, easier-to-deal with breasts.   Unfortunately I got here through bc but I am happy with it just the same!   I hated those things!  ",

Her hair looks good but I noticed that the roots are all dark and the rest has been highlighted. She said she did this so that the chemicals don't touch her scalp. She quickly explained there is no evidence regarding deleterious effects of the chemicals but that she personally felt better not having it touch her scalp. Her hair looks really cute also. The whole chemicals touching our scalp does make me wonder but not enough to stop! Also, yesterday when I got out of the shower instead of the porcupine look I actually had some hair that was long enough to look wet and stuck to my scalp from the water and it is starting to look like HAIR! On coloring, I think use your best judgment. I was never told there was a waiting period on coloring after chemo. Ginger: the light blonde to cover white always looks so nice. I am premature gray and am waiting to see what disaster sprouts post-chemo. I will undoubtedly be more gray than brown and will be coloring asap. I have always highlighted so the chemicals never touched my scalp anyway except for what she would apply to the \"runway!\" Rachel: starting tamox on Xmas eve?!?!? Ho ho ho indeed!!!!! Adey: I despise \"Cougartown!\" I just hate it! I watched it a few times and it is just gross! Sorry to all the fans...this is just me! I don't like that entire evening on ABC. None of those show! Adey, what bothers me about all the lip stuff is what are they planning to do with those lips?! I mean do they really get the connection? Do is ever hit them in between their stupid eyes? I love Martha Plimpton and I love her on \"Raising Hope.\" Not only do they have a great cast but Cloris Leachman is the grandmother and it is just a funny show. The bottom line is Plimpton appears to have not embraced the plastic movement and she looks good. If you eat and exercise, there is only so long you can fight genetics and if these women can only get roles because they are attempting to stop the clock then art is not imitating life. There should be tons of roles for women, congruent with the daily lives of women, to satisfy motion picture and tv requirements. Bottom line is until Oprah and the like (Drew Barrymore has her own production company) take over Hollywood and at least 50% of the controls are run by women, these dumbos will still pander with puffed lips and silicon valley breasts.....sad....very sad, indeed!!!!

Glad the apt is good and, yes, no rent is a huge perk! How is the kitten? Did you keep her/him? It is so good to hear from you. I am glad you are doing well. What a great holiday gift that you are settled and happy! That is good stuff. Lago: a woman at a local grocery store I regularly go to said \"I can tell it's you even though you are wearing that hat and glasses...I can recognize those big eyes and smile anywhere!\" At least chemo left us with something recognizable! Calamtykel: I felt kind of weird when she told me she would not necessarily advocate rads because of some new schematic they developed over the past few years blah blah but, at the same time, I was cautiously elated that I was being told not to do it. I, just like you, am going to go on faith that it is the right thing to do. Lady: it is such a total travesty that we have to GAIN weight, be it water or poison or whatever, during chemo. I remember my father probably lost 30 lbs during chemo. Of course that was 12 years ago and he was constantly sick. I feel like such a cow and I can't get by this feeling. I cannot wait for Jan 15 because my ass is getting right back to daily workouts and I am dumping this weight. I am so aggravated. Today I went to 4 stores and on my way to the final store I had to stop and take a little break because my breathing was getting to me AND my lower back hurt (sort of like the \"you period is here\" lower back pain) and I have been getting that for a while. Believe me, I am as frustrated as you are with this entire mess. May you no longer look pregnant in 3 months when the assault on your body has stopped and you can exercise again. I can't stand this...it is just so aggravating! I actually had a dream that I was rail thin and I had hair...I never wanted to wake up!!!!!!! Neulasta: I never had any bone pain from Neulasta but today and 1 time last week, while laying down, I started to get pains in my ribs and my breast bone. It hurt but it was sort of like a slow-moving, sharp pain thing? It sort of felt like what people describe when they are having a heart attack but it was no where near my heart. Anyone want to explain what their neulasta pain felt like? I am also 2 weeks since the shot so I thought it was weird that I might get pain now? Who knows....! Well, I finally finished Christmas shopping and got my last gifts in the mail today. I am so glad that is done. Now tomorrow I wrap and clean the house, do a little grocery shopping and go to the local \"free\" donation center. They take in clothes, small appliances, canned goods etc.. and they allow people in need to come in and take it for free. A friend of mine and I were talking about Goodwill and the Salvation Army and how some people don't even have the few bucks to pay to get the things they need so I am donating a bunch of stuff again to the free store. Oh yeah, I also go to the local \"no-kill\" humane society to donate 20 lbs bags of food. Tomorrow is all about altruism. My cat I have now was cared for by the humane society but they did a trap-neuter-release (TNR) so she had her poor ear clipped (code for a TNR) and she lived by the highway! That poor cat broke my heart but I was still happy the humane society neutered her even though they had to release her because the shelter was full. Now she has the best home ever! I hope you all have a lovely evening and may we all get rid of the *&^%*((^$ WEIGHT! Goodnight-",

Good for you. At least you have your markers and, actually, it is great that you might not start until after the New Year. Enjoy the holidays. Do you have far to travel for rads? With the Canadian winter and going daily for 6 weeks, I hope you don't have a long ride. Ckptry: I do notice that some parts are growing, faster and longer, than others. The top still looks porcupine-ish and the back is growing and over my ears is growing. It is fine also. I never lost my brows or lashes....one little treat. I never thought I would be watching my hair grow! I do seem preoccupied with it, however. BTW, this messy growth is NOT an attractive look on anyone! Lady: thanks so much for the report. I have tearing eyes, morning \"eye crusties,\" blood coming out of my nose at every sneeze and blow, and now your information makes me want to rush off to the opthamologist. I am going to get it checked. Such good info-thank you. Omaz: already with the hair appointments in January! Good for you! At this point I think we can all go to a barber shop! Sundiego: I had to do 6 TAC. I have not heard of more than 6 TCH but I am sure people have had it. Best of luck to her. Ann97: did you have a bmx? Why would you still be getting mammos? Perhaps you had an mx? Just wondering. Omaz: NICE PIC! That is us! Hot, hot photo, man! We are collectively startlingly attractive!!!! Iowa and Rachel: we will all have moon faces this year in the holiday photos but wait until next year's photos and we can then compare about how we no longer have big, fat, moon faces! Sptmm: I don't have a 17 year old who wants to pet my head (!!!) but I do have that baby soft hair....very short and soft. I do like to pet my own head, however! Well, I am still wrapping and getting ready for these holidays but, and so thankfully, I don't have to go to any more stores It is so nice to be done with this.  I am so looking forward to resting on Xmas Eve and day, I just can't express it enough with words!   Happy trails, all",

Calamtykel: get away from the radiation.  Go to the new place where they have a better, healthier technology.   I was bitching up a storm when, at 38 years old with no family history of bc, my gyn wanted me to get a mammo.  I did not go.   She called me and was like why were you a no-show, you need to get this done blah blah.   Still I did not want to go because my feeling is it the chicken or the damn egg when it comes to this mammo/radiation exposure crap.   Another gyn from the practice called me and was telling me to get to the mammo blah blah so finally off I went.  It showed shadows and sure enough, 2 years later, those shadows would become bc.   I still don't like mammos, however.  I figured I did not need one good boob because given my luck the cells would have said 'hey, there is an empty hotel over there on the right and it looks empty...let's set up camp!'  and that is the voice of my bc cells!   I just did not want to have to go through all the \"investigating\" of every freakin' shadow until the day I die.   I also figured I wanted a matching set!   A matching set of cut up boobs no less!   Everyone: Please don't misconstrue my comments...this was my choice and my thinking on this matter.  It was not an easy choice but I did not want to spend the rest of my life in and out of the medical industrial complex being poked and prodded...for me that was a fate worse than losing both breasts.   They also discussed the merits of a lumpectomy with me which I thought was completely ludicrous.   Coming from the financial industry, and knowing what I know about bc etc..., my gut told me to, at the very least, get an mx as a lumpectomy seemed to be a way of annuitizing income!   Seriously...I am sorry...I know that sounds horrible but I think a lumpectomy is a loosely-cloaked comeback track.   Again, though, for all of you who did have lumpectomies, that was the right choice for you.   I chose the most radical option so I could have the greatest possible chances of no recurrence and getting the heck out of the doctor circuit.  To me, losing both was a way out of the medical world...god willing!  Ann97: it is funny that you now mention margins.  I did not think there was any margins to speak of with a bmx/mx but now, after the meeting with the rad onc, she mentioned that my margins were good and that it was further evidence I did not need rads.   Now I understand why you have to have mammos but I would damn scared as well about the squishing causing a rupture to the implant.   Geez, louise...our worries never stop, do they?!    I will flip my lid if they start telling me I have to go for mammos....my next question will be who is going to pay for the replacement of the ruptured implant.  What I don't understand also is if we just got bmxs and did not get any implants it would be impossible to mammo.   Why do they treat implants as an opp to mammo especially when the chances of being able to accurately mammo the chest wall via mammo with an implant seems kind of impossible.  All questions to ask, I guess. Well, one of my evening naps has caused me some excess energy this evening..yay!   It feels good to be getting some stuff done.  Goodnight all-",

Texas: Did not forget the netbook!   How are you doing these days? Omaz:  You and Kel are in the post-chemo olympics it seems!  Seriously, though, with the kind of exercising so many of you who have finished are doing, it gives the rest of us inspiration.  I am sure that 10 lbs will be gone in no time....maybe 20! Adey: thanks for updating the thread.  I appreciate it.  Your last tx is Friday, right?  I am so glad you are finishing.  Ginger: I hate getting the port flushed...it makes me sick but then again everything does these days.   I think that 1 year is kind of antiquated nowadays.  They seem to remove them more quickly as I think, like Kel said, for muscle and infections issues, they want them out pretty quick, In any case, have to get the port accessed now..will post more in a bit !",

I can't believe what you are going through and the waiting again. That is the whole theme to this process: waiting. I feel for you. We are all getting to the point on this journey where the bumps are all going to be investigated and I am sure most of us, at some point or another, are going to find themselves in the position you are in now. I feel for you, I really do. Well, just remember, they are going to be more aggressive with us relative to biopsying everything they find. I feel for you. Texas: Yes, I am finally feeling better, a bit more energetic, no more shortness of breath and today I was actually going to get on the treadmill. Of course, I am feeling better now and will have to be immersed back into chemo again at some point soon. That really sucks. Today, for the first time in a long time I feel closest to what I did before chemo started, albeit still a little tired. I am glad to hear you are feeling good and that you have some appts set up. I wish you the best. It is always nice to get things moving forward. Good for you on the Komen walk. I am considering signing up for a big walk in New Haven in May. It is at a waterfront park. I just want to know I am finished with chemo and will be up for the walk. Rachel: there was something about that story today, from the VNA person, that just did not ring true. That is why I asked you. I think it was an illustrious story designed to showcase the Canadian system in an unfavorable light. I was talking about this wound management I am doing at home and she brought up how the Canadian system is not great. All I know is those of you with cancer are having as good a time of it, or better, than those of us in the US. No system is without flaws but I certainly think Canada is doing pretty well by it's people...as far as I can tell anyway. I will look up the healing journey. It sounds like a group that would attract those wanting to help themselves so perhaps there will be a different vibe than a support group might garner. As for our bodies still producing estrogen through fatty glands, unbelievable! Can we possibly get away from this?! Gross! Sptmm: I used Wii Fit at my friend's house and I liked it. I don't have it myself because I have to control myself when it comes to buying \"stuff!\" I am going to use it a few more times and if I like it, I will get it. I make myself revisit the idea 3xs when it comes to buying tech and, if after the third time I am still into the idea, I will then get it! Actually now I am onto Xbox Connect....this is why I make myself wait! Libraylil: Be very careful with the drains. That is why I have this miserable infection today. I broke the fall of a small, frail, elderly woman who was walking into a store in front of me and started to fall because of the cracked sidewalk pavement. In any case, I only held her for about 25 seconds before a big guy came running over to assist but, during that experience, somehow one of the drains was incapacitated. Later that night I woke up with fluid having leaked out on my bed and I was in a panic. I tried to put the drain back in which is undoubtedly where the infection began. In any case, 6 months later, 1 TE down and having spent NYE getting surgery and in the hospital, I remind you to be careful! Also Liberator Fashions has several camisoles with built-in drain pouches and they are actually attached with Velcro to a band inside. Most insurance companies pay for the camis. You might want to check them out. Ladyinbama: congratulations on getting the go-ahead for planning recon! Another step forward....so nice. I hope the Auburn Tigers are winning! Zenith: you are EMPTYING your container tomorrow!  Gadzooks....gallbladder, full hysterectomy and port-removal in 1 day?! That is an awful lot. There will be lots of celebratory pizza in your future!  I will be sending good vibes, big hugs and wishes for a quick and easy surgery your way.  May you feel good enough to jog home from the hospital!  Well, the Northeast is getting a N'oreaster = another foot of snow starting late tomorrow I will spend time tomorrow night planning my relocation to a warmer climate...Brazil perhaps seeing as even Florida has gotten snow this year!",

Texas: I agree with ckptry in that you will be in the 25%. Additionally, it is 1 in 4 today and very well could be 2 in 4 soon enough. These stats are fast becoming antiquated as they learn more and more about bc. On the surgery, it is going to be such a breeze and you will so good when it is done because you sort of feel like you are permanently evicting any possibility of that cancer still living in your body. It is a great feeling to wake up from surgery knowing you made the choice and did all you could do to get it out of your body. Libraylil: I am so glad your BS feels good about the margins and that is over with. It is also nice that the staff was in good spirits and kept your mind off surgery before you went in. Glad that part of it is over for you. Ladyinbama: When you were hospitalized and they could not figure out what was going on, I guarantee it was the TE. That is what I was hospitalized for and chemo will very quickly smoke out any other type of infection like a tooth infection for example. It will go full-blown immediately. I would try to get some follow up on the TE and make sure one breast is not retaining more water than the other because that is a lingering sign of infection. Hope your appt does not get cancelled but looking at that avatar it seems all but guaranteed! Sohardbnme: welcome back! Missed you. How did you like Zumba? That is great that it was a class for survivors. I am wondering how you liked it. Good for you on picking yourself up, dusting off and joining the gym. Good moves. Glad to hear from you. Calamtykel: sorry about the tamoxifen issues. Do you think the symptoms you are having now will go away as you \"come up\" on the dosage? I know it is frustrating and the 5 year thing is a long time. What is the address for lifemath? Iowa: enjoy the warmth!  I am finishing chemo and I am seriously thinking I need to go away for a bit. This CT winter is unbelievable. Omaz: YAY!

JSW: how are you doing these days? I hope you are doing well. Sptmm: I am right across from you, woman, just a boat ride through LI sound and that storm this week is supposed to be another mess. My brother was in from Houston this weekend not before stopping in NJ on business and he was telling me how a coworker who lives in CT was remarking how he had to shovel his roof. My brother was so surprised to hear something like that! I told him they are $60 and flying out of the stores. Deb, how much more of this can we take?!?!? I have chemo again next week, last one, and then have to go back for neulasta...ugh...I would like ONE snow-free week. I hope you all had a nice weekend and for those of you in a warm climate, enjoy!",

Calamtykel: You absolutely have to be your own advocate and if you continue to struggle with such cumbersome SEs, then perhaps it is not for you. To gain 4% points on survival rates and to struggle through these miserable SEs, it just might not be worth it. Personally, though, I do very much hope you and these SEs make peace and things calm down for you because even though 4% points is not a lot, I am not sure how to quantify the estrogen control features of tamoxifen. I am just hopeful it calms down for you as you definitely need to be present for your family especially with the rigors of home schooling. The choices aren't so hot, I will admit.

Rachel: I think we all could complain about weight gain from feeling so incapacitated and worn out from all these meds that we all have put on some weight and/or are just struggling to try to get back into a workout regimen. You are sooo not alone! I, too, am going for a post-chemo check-up, chat and med talk with my most favorite doc in the world, and my most trusted medical confidante, my GP! I can't wait to see him...it has been months. I did not go during chemo because of the numerous sick people. Congratulations on being ½ way done with rads. So nice to be putting all of this behind us. Good techs/medical personnel really do make it easier. JSW: I don't know why I forgot about the Abraxane that we just spoke about a few weeks ago, and that you would be finishing shortly after me! So soon you will be closing this parade! Omaz: Thanks for asking....the last chemo is starting to take hold. After I get plowed out from this next 12\" of snow we are getting overnight, and on a reduced amount of steroids, tomorrow I am off to neulasta and then surely home to bed to sleep off this mess for the next several days. I will tell you this: I did not miss it! Ladyinbama: After chemo I have 5 more surgeries to look forward to and non-stop doctor visits, no doubt. I also have a muga scan coming up. I am looking forward to the results of that. As for the LE therapist, it sounds like you had a productive, satisfying visit where your concerns were managed and fears allayed. Doesn't it feel good?! Congrats on heading into port removal. Mine goes in March...looking forward to that. Then again, with rashes and open wounds, who knows? Basically I will be doing the run to the doctors for the next several months as well. Oh boy... I am also happy you are having a return to energy and are getting some gray hairs sprouting. Always nice to get that feeling you are regaining a sense of normalcy. Well folks, I have a mysterious, non-itchy rash on my thighs, inner arms and a little on my stomach. My onc said it looked like I had an allergic reaction to something I ate and it should go away overnight...wrong. It is still here and I have not eaten anything odd nor have I changed soap, laundry detergent etc... I am petrified now because I have that 2.5\" wide open wound in my chest and am concerned that, even though I clean it and repack twice daily, that something has gotten in and/or is infecting me. I was rather hoping it might be a reaction to the steroids but the onc team said no, the steroids should kill it. This rash, should it not go away, will undoubtedly become yet another drama on this bc highway. Will keep you all posted. Did some internet research and came up with a few ideas but will be heading to the doc as soon as I am coming off the chemo sludge and when, hopefully, I have some wbc's in my blood protecting me from all that mess out there! Goodnight, all-",

Will be heading over to check it out. Ginger- Great news that there is enough hair for the baby to grab onto! As for animals, I just toss it out into the woods for the poor squirrels, rabbits etc... who cannot forage as well as they did before this 4' of snow hit the ground. I don't have any horses etc.. . I was one of the few little girls in this world who never dreamed of her wedding gown/day nor did I want a horse! That DNA skipped me. Hope the infection is cleared up by the ZPak. I, too, have been a bit concerned for my \"inner\" balance with all of these antibiotics I have been on. I think in my case, having been on so many over the holidays, I am concerned for my organs and how they are putting up with it. Oh well...the alternative is a paltry choice for sure! Mommichelle: YAY- McPlayland and then snowtubing! What a great Sunday! Zenith: that is awful about the darn cataracts. I really thought it was chemo but I had forgotten about the dexamethasone. That was one bottle I was very happy to throw away. I would definitely try to stay out of work until the surgeries are done. The last thing you want to do is be going in and out of work, after getting back from bc, because of surgeries relating to that. You might as well try to stay out if you can and get another release letter. Omaz: no, that rash is not clearing up but it appears to be drying up and now looks like it has calamine lotion on it....sort of eczema-ish. Yale is supposed to have their bc dermatologist call me to make an appt next week. We shall see. How are you doing? Nice weather out in the desert? Meanwhile, back in snowville, we are bracing for another storm and I have yet to hear from my plow people about the roof shovels they are waiting for via fedex from Grainger! Fun times out here. JSW: not too bad on the SEs so far. I know Feb 4th is your last trip to chemoland and I am going to be sending you the best wishes all week, right up to Friday. Well, now I want ice cream! Who knows?! It is not that cold yet so perhaps I will head out. I hope you all had a lovely weekend and a good night. Looking forward to some rest and tv tonight....my favs!",

I remember being in therapy and telling him how I felt about my workouts and being able to jump start myself and he said the catastrophic things you have been through as of late are not going to respond to your old methods.  Good, bad or indifferent, you are in unchartered territory and you have to respond differently.  He told me I was going to need additional support to get through this time and he was right. Finding that lump was a terrible scare and I think that may have pushed you into this new territory. Don't forget, when your body moves into \"new territory\" it is just helping you because it can't stay where you are at *and* deal with the situation at hand. The newness of the \"new frontier\" is scary but it is your body's coping mechanism. You really need to take the meds before you become paralyzed with fear so you don't go *there.* Don't worry about scaring us with your tamox stories....don't forget there is a very long thread devoted to the good, and not-so-good, about the tamoxifen experience. It is NOT for everyone but do you think being on tamox and finding that lump was just a very bad confluence of events and you might be pinning some of the dreaded anxiety over the lump on tamoxifen? Just wondering and I am sure you have thought about that.  I think we have all dealt with this journey pretty well and it has been terrifying at times for us all. Just be glad you had enough of a mental, physical and emotional reserve to get you through this type of challenge that can break many, many people. You made it through. To be honest, I think one of the hardest parts is post-chemo and post-trauma when you try to put your life back together....that is a big challenge. May you find some peace and may you accept the help on hand.  Let it get you through.  I have to start tamox at the end of this month....not looking forward to it and I am totally not looking forward to a perpetuation of the hormone rollercoaster but alas I can't deal with the alternative.",

May you catch up on sleep next week ;) Calamtykel: you, sptmm and I all have reason to complain as we have *never* had a winter like this and if this is what winter was like in CT normally, I would not be living here. I know what you mean about the crusty snow and when I did my monthly reconciling I realized I am out $280 in plow services for January alone. I am sure you are inundated with collapsing-roof stories on the nightly news as we are so I decided to explore getting the roof shoveled. The quote was $250 and when I asked about their insurance they said they had it but when I pressed for details like perhaps a policy# etc... I find that the wall was paper and the 5 or 6 calls I made about such services were contractors wanting to make the money and then sue when one of their workers hits the ground. There was a special on the news about the lack of insurance of these \"roof\" shovelers. Bottom line is if they are shoveling your roof and even though they claimed they had insurance, if they fall you will get sued for damages. I said forget it and I am going to try to get a roof rake myself. So Kel, you are not alone....I am fed up with winter AND the gargantuan out-of-pocket costs. I even my own small snowblower. It would not have been too useful this year but I was not too useful this year! Between chemo, the infection and subsequent hospitalization, I had no choice but I promise you this: if I am feeling better in February, a snowblowing I will go! What is our solace? The groundhog did not see it's shadow!!!! Lisasinglem: Brazil and men.....yikes! Not such a good combination! I am going to steam my face with lemons.   Good times! ",

I have been busy today just trying to get some things done that I started during the final phases of chemo and in between hospitalization and infection time consumers! Seriously, though, I am happy to be beyond chemo. DebJ: the plastic surgery side of the bc battle is a real disappointment still. So many are not happy with their results and I just expect to be disappointed as well! They still have a long way to go with that side of the business. Did you get your nipple done as well? Perhaps after it settles in (don't forget there is a settling in process) it will come back to where it is supposed to be. I think settling takes a month or so. Don't be too disappointed yet. I went bmx simply because I was so fearful cancer would set up camp in the \"healthy\" breast. In the end, however, and through interviewing plastics and doing a lot of research on women who had recon, arm-chair analysis says there is roughly a 50/50 chance you will be even remotely happy with the results. Just try to hold on to what made you do the mx/bmx and that should help you through. Also, give it some time. Check back in another 2 to 3 weeks and let us know how things are and if you are any happier. In the end, however, it does seem the ps side of bc has a long way to go. I am sorry you are not feeling so great about it now but perhaps some chocolate today made you feel better?! Texas: I was just talking to someone this weekend about how happy I was that I went bmx with all those pre-cancer cells, dirty lymph nodes and my dastardly luck knowing those damn cells would probably move to the hotel on the right as they heard there were vacancies in that one! I am so glad you went bmx also. Man, I cannot believe you still had live cells after chemo although I know it happens. A woman I met at chemo had that same issue and from what I understand it is not entirely uncommon. Hopefully rads will kill off any others and don't forget, you have the wonderful gift of youth on your side! Between rads, chemo, your very optimistic perspective, the bmx and your age, I think you are going to be just fine. Glad you are back here with us also. Hope you had a good Valentine's Day. Omaz: a great, big, happy Valentine's Day to you! I hope you had a good one. How are you doing today? Hope you are feeling ok. Any more news on the LE? So sorry to hear about that situation. It is almost like post-bc dx and chemo etc.. we are in a veritable mine field of potential other biological disturbances. I don't like this part of it! Ginger: rads knocks you out in a different way than chemo did and many say it's SEs are cumulative and will show up more the longer you go. Don't knock yourself for not wanting to go. The people may be nice but on some level perhaps you are just not looking forward to going. Also the every day schedule can make you tired in and of itself. I sincerely doubt they will ask you to leave. Just don't be too hard on yourself about not going today. The nausea may have had nothing to do with rads...maybe you were just not feeling to well for other reasons. Take it easy and I hope you had a nice Valentine's Day. Rachel: finally almost done! You must be so happy between nearing the end of rads and that yummy chocolate you had today! Good for you on both counts. Sohardbnme: how are YOU doing?! Nice to hear from you. I hope you had a nice Valentine's Day and things are continuing to look up for you. Ladyinbama: How are you doing these days? When do you get your results? I hope you had a nice Valentine's Day. We hit 55 degrees in CT today also and I was so happy to ride around with my winter jacket on AND the windows open!!!!! It was so grand! JSW: off to rads! Good for you. Before you know it May will be here and we will all be celebrating some hair, normalcy in our lives again and summer! All good things to look forward to. Glad you are feeling better and hope you had a nice Valentine's Day. BTW, thanks for clearing up the oncotype testing for me. I know we have covered the topic before but I seem to forget some of the details on this whole matter. Sometimes I do think there should be wikicancerpedia! Seriously...there are so many nuances etc... I would like to be able to just go online and get my questions answered in a wiki-fashion! Mommichelle: So happy to hear your are back in business relative to your computer situation! I have spares for just this reason. Thanks for your well wishes in regards to my sister and her loss. I feel so bad for her...she is so lost without him. She met him when they were 15. In any case, it is a reminder that life is precious. I hope you had a nice Valentine's Day. Well, I learned today I used to be able to carry a 6 pack of water with one hand and now I feel like I have tennis elbow. Must be another gift from bc/chemo/muscle atrophy....I think I am going to move into a nursing home soon!!! I have my muga scan this week and a dermatologist appt to check out that rash which is not going away and that which my GP thinks is a fungus...great. More fun...every day more fun. I hope everyone is doing well and I have to say I enjoy our group and this thread. It is all some comfortable and supportive and I thank you all for that. Have a good night everyone-",

It was a balmy 50 in CT today and I took advantage of this to open the windows in my house and get in some fresh air. As I told you all yesterday, I watched \"Sex and the City 2\" last night. Well, during the movie, Samantha, the oldest of the characters, is eating hummus and yams because she remarks they are high in naturally occurring estrogen and she is trying to stave off menopause. In any case, it got me thinking about how I personally don't feel the entire bc experience has enough nutritional and exercise support. So many of us have had questions about exercise and, to be honest, maybe it did not come as a surprise to you all but I had NO clue hummus and yams, as well as a number of other foods, are high in naturally occurring estrogens. Aren't these foods that we are supposed to avoid? So I decided to do a little research and I found this information: James A. Duke, author of \"CRC Handbook of Medicinal Spices.\" Adding large amounts of certain spices to your diet can raise your estrogen levels significantly, adds Duke. Keep caraway, coriander, poppy, sesame, anise, mustard, fennel and fenugreek on hand; added to your foods, they can increase estrogen. Also flax and flaxseed oil are high in naturally occurring estrogens. Shouldn't we be told this *immediately* upon dx? Like shouldn't we be given a list of foods and spices we should avoid if our bc is ER+/PR+? I am pretty disappointed to find this out in such a haphazard manner. Again, perhaps you all knew this but I had no clue. I knew about Soy but I thought hummus was made from chic peas and are chic peas soy? I seriously think a nutritional and exercise component have to be built into all bc care programs. I enjoy a poppy seed bagel on occasion and now I learn this should be something I avoid and I had to learn this from a movie?! I would like to hear what you all think about this. Omaz: terrible times out there in the warm desert with your shorts and tanks on! Congratulations on just about finishing your boosts and thereby putting rads behind you..YAY! Also, it was smart of you to request they slow the drip from 30 min to 1 hour. I would have never even thought of doing that. It is awful that people come to work sick especially with your somewhat precarious state now with just about finishing your bc treatments. Very sad that they do that. I am sorry you got sick from it. Clearly they have annoyed you with their coming to work sick and if you do not sit near them, tape a sardine under their chair! Let them live with that for a while! Years ago when I worked in NY there was a woman that was always drenched in some awful malodorous scent as she was trying to score a banker (!) and so finally we thought if we have to smell your stench, you can smell a stench also and we put all sorts of stuff taped under her chair! I know...juvenile but we could not help it! Libraylil: say it is not so? Aspiration? It sounds like it is a necessary evil at this point and you definitely don't want to have rads impeded or you given too high a dose b/c of fluid. Yes, these glitches are indeed frustrating and I don't blame you for feeling like you wanted to punch someone. Your DH is a lovely man for talking you through that. This is an emotionally frustrating journey we are on. On a brighter note, I hope you enjoyed Herceptin happy hour! Ckptry: thanks so much for the offer. I appreciate it. Congrats on getting your swap out surgery in March! What a nice way to head into spring! Lucky you. JSW: how was the muga? Were you able to wrestle any info out of the techs who did the scan? I asked mine to blink twice if it looked good! Rachel: CONGRATULATIONS on finishing rads! A big, huge YAY for you! Relative to surgeries, we all should just appreciate our non-surgery days of our past and accept that now, with our new found bc trip, surgery is just another part of it. I don't even give a crap anymore!!! Rae786: thanks for stopping by and I so hope you are correct and we will all be laughing about this madness next year! God help us! I am tired as I think the fresh air really knocked me out today. It was so nice out. I am looking forward to what you all have to say about the lack of nutritional and exercise directives under the aegis of these bc circuit care. I really think it needs to be a lot less fragmented. To the credit of Yale, they are working toward that one stop shopping idea with the Smilow Cancer Hospital but I seriously think there should be nutritional and exercise advice as a mandatory component. Do I really have to learn nutritional advice inadvertently from \"Sex and the City?!\" I hope you all have a lovely night-",

I am looking at homes in FL mainly Atlantic side. I like Naples on the West coast but there is something about me where I need to be near the ocean. I can't be landlocked either. Texas: Congrats on the STABLE news! Good for you! You could very well be stable for years and years. This is good news. On the return to school and nursing program, one of the reasons I am looking to go south is so I can live comfortably and go to school full-time without working. More to this point, about studying for the nursing entrance, I picked up some books from Amazon. I don't know how far the program you are entering goes with math but the \"Algebra Survival Guide\" is excellent and it also comes with a workbook and the 2 together cost about $30. Also, I would encourage you to get \"Barron's Anatomy Flash Cards, 2nd Edition\" which will be helpful in establishing a basis for anatomy and physiology courses. Don't worry about high schoolers and competing...don't forget most of them aren't paying any attention anyway! Have you seen the national average scores in math and science??!! I think you will be just fine! I have been studying Italian (I speak Japanese and some Mandarin...why not a language congruent with my ethnicity?!?!!!), Anatomy and Physiology, Algebra and Trig reviews, Biology and Chemistry all in preparation for entering the program either in September or January. Up here it is all about pre-reqs, when they are offered, the classes fill very quickly (like days to be exact), and waiting the semesters to drag by as I can't even apply until certain courses are completed at these schools. The accelerated programs for students with degrees already are equally as competitive and crazy with the pre-reqs also. My friend who is a nurse and I were talking about how long it takes to get into nursing school in CT and it seems, on average, 1.5 years just to get accepted! It is ridiculous especially when you think about the nursing shortage. This is yet another reason why I am looking to move South as schools in FL seem much more fast-tracked about getting you in. They are, however, one of the states with the worst nursing shortage so I guess that makes sense! In any case, no matter where I attend, I am going into this nursing program wicked prepared because I refuse to struggle with remedial subject matter of 20 years ago. Plus this stuff did not come easy to me then....I have to be prepared! Ginger: you totally are not alone....we ARE all wearing down with this. Between mets potential, additional testing, other docs (gyn etc...) poking around looking for trouble, scans, traveling back and forth, the unknown of it all etc... is enough to drive anyone mad. I also realized that somewhere in the 60's/70's the medical industrial complex STOPPED curing disease and started to treat it like the behemoth income machine it is. There was a guy on TV who was like 50 years old this morning talking about how his mom died of MS in 06 and how she suffered for years and years. It got me thinking...I have not heard of a cure for anything in decades in this country.  The W.H.O stopped the spread of small pox but since they found a preventive measure (some call it a cure) for polio there has been nothing.  How could the cure factor have become so stagnant?  It is a reminder of capitalist effects on to cure or not-to-cure. Somewhere along the line they stopped looking for cures for anything, not just cancer, and simply started to treat...it is a travesty and we all have a front row seat to this show.  Some say the cure to cancer is vitamin B17 but others say it is preventative....and the fed gov, FDA and AMA say it is quackery!!!!!  JSW: great on the MUGA! That is so cool that your's keeps going up! I can only imagine this was last MUGA as they looked at me like I had 2 heads, even though adriamyacin can very well kill your heart (!), when I requested this last one! As for the story about the trees in Toomer's Corner and fandome-gone-wild, that is just sick. I hope he/she is imprisoned for that. Trees are so precious. The other day at the store I read on one of the Kleenex boxes that for every tree they take down they plant 3 more...that is the way to do it! Sweeney: so funny about pics! I went to Manhattan regularly as a teenager (was in the clubs at 16!) but when I was about 13 my friend Alison and I were in Grand Central and there were some really hot guys so one of us would go and stand, looking rather inconspicuous or so we thought, near the guys but acting as if we were getting a photo taken of the terminal etc.. and we would get pics of them! He he he! It was a clever plan but surely some of them knew what we were up to! Oh Sweeney...he was black-haired and blue-eyed....beautiful skin and perfect teeth...I am really particular about teeth! His only defect was he was not that tall...perhaps 5'6\" or so...I like them taller. I actually dated a guy once that was 6'7\"...football player...a gentle giant he was! I will try to capture photos as I see handsome men as we these phones, it is entirely feasible! Lady: I agree that I should be asking more questions but instilling in us the knowledge that commonly consumed items like yams and hummus are chock full of naturally occurring estrogen might help! Do I have to pull this information out of them?!?!? Also, one day during chemo I asked about a nutritionist. She came to see me while I was getting chemo and I talked to her about my aversion to meet because of the hormones and the grotesque slaughter house industry and she replied with \"well, I eat meat so...\" SO WHAT?! Did I ask you if you ate meat? I was rather hoping she would sit down and talk about what you and I are discussing right now but she was a buffoon. How freakin' stupid to tell me what she does and does not like. I could have accepted her narcissism if she told me she had bc and still ate meat but that was not the case. Jokers! You are correct, however, and I will attempt a drag-it-out-of-them session next week when I seem them again and get my tamoxifen rx...ugh! All indicators, so far, point to the ground hog having been correct! I am so hoping for an early spring. I can't take this cold too much more. I am going to go get some stuff done. Good day to you all-",

More to this point, I am going to PT at Yale so they can give me some more guidance.  I am going to ask specifically about this cording business.  I will report back my findings :)",

Lady: I don't think you are in denial and, if denial gets you through then, no, it is not necessarily bad.  I have not been whining and crying since my dx either.  I just think that so many are dxd with cancer these days, the number is now 1 in 5, that we have so much company and so many are getting treated and successfully moving on and having long lives, it is no longer the awful dx it once was.  There are several diseases far worse and more deliterious than cancer.  I think we all have hope also b/c bc, sorry to say, is a popular cancer for funding for research and development that for that very reason, we all can have hope for the future.  If you look back over your life and during catastrophic times, if you were a basket case, I think the blow cancer delivers to the psyche forces your mind to help you deal more effectively.  I don't think we can process the enormity of the situation, with all of it's connotations, over a long period of time anyway.   I don't question my lack of emotional response to bc but I think Sweeney posted once that she felt, for one reason or another (I forget), that she could not tap into her emotions.  That got me thinking.  I don't know if it is in me and has not come out but, either way, cancers of all sorts are life-long diseases and can be destructive to your mindset if you deal with them at full emotional throttle which, quite frankly, would be an awful existence anyway.  I think your mind knows what is best for your body and their is a symbiosis that goes beyond comprehension during these times.

      "Content": "Mar 21, 2011 08:14AM - edited Mar 21, 2011 08:23AM by 1WonderWoman Kel makes some very good points.   There is a plethora of information on B17...a very interesting topic. As for kale, I needed to figure out how I could prepare it/what to do with it!  From this site: www.eatrundoyoga.com/blog/kale...  I found information on a few ideas for preparing kale, as follows (hope it helps someone else as clueless as I was when it comes to kale preparation!) : When you are ready to eat your kale, and I suggest that you eat it soon after bringing it home, first wash the kale and then strip out the stems and rip the leaves into small pieces. Then, here are my five favorite ways to prepare kale: 1. Saute. Saute the leaves in sesame oil and garlic until they are limp and bright, and serve sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. 2. Roast. Place the DRY leaves in a baking dish and toss with olive oil. Bake in 450 oven for 5-10 minutes until leaves are crispy, stirring occasionally. Sprinkle with salt and serve. 3. Soup. Make a soup out of one head of garlic peeled and chopped, one onion chopped, 1 bunch kale de-stemmed and chopped, 2 medium potatoes chopped, 2 carrots diced, any other veggies you like, and 8 cups veggie broth. Saute the garlic and onions first, and then combine everything in a big soup pot. Simmer until potatoes are tender. As an option, add rice vinegar, salt, and / or pepper and season to taste. 4. Smoothie. Make your favorite smoothie, and add in tiny pieces of kale. Start with 1/2 a handful and then add more if you like. 5. Steam. Bring about 1/2 cup of water in a large pot or Dutch Oven to a boil. Add a tablespoon or two of Earth Balance, and your kale. Put the lid on the pot and steam until kale is tender, adding water as necessary. Then season with salt and pepper, lemon juice, olive oil, and / or soy sauce. B17: I have been reading on this topic for a while.  Some of the foods where B17 is naturally occurring are:  Barley, bitter almonds (not the sweet almonds commonly available), native (bitter) cassava, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), grass (wheat grass and many other grasses), lentils, flaxseed, millet, and the seeds of various fruits (apple, apricot, blackthorn, cherry, nectarine, peach, plum). Most of these foods have been deleted from the modern diet. To prevent cancer, a maintenance dose of vitamin B17 can be provided by eating several bitter almonds or apricot seeds daily.  Also, of note, B17 cannot function without sufficient zinc in the body.  Things you need to know! Bottom line on B17: no matter what the government has decided about B17 supplements (and a docs inability to prescribe it as it is illegal for them to do so) or what you might believe, it would not hurt to get some into your body on a daily basis.  ",

I have been on tamoxifen about a month and my biggest problems are the sweating and sleep issues, some nausea, lack of sleep and I am achey.  I just don't talk about these things much b/c I don't know if it is left over from chemo, if it is age or what.  I hate to complain but I have to be honest with you all.  Also, the rash on my butt, lower back and inside of 1 arm is very, very weird and I will be off to the derma about that.  I don't know about you all but I am so tired of going to doctors.  I mean they are all nice and pleasant so it is not about the doctors themselves but I am just tired of having to go.  Oh well...enough whining! Rachel: your hair looks great.   It is growing in pretty well.

As for you, it seems as if your job might be demanding from some of what you have said and doing that on a lack of sleep and being a mother and wife is an awful lot of hats to wear when you are running on fumes of sleep.   I sure hope they are able to help you out in some way. Sleep: if/when any of you have taken a sleep aid or an anti-anxiety med to help you sleep, do you find when you wake your sleep seems to have been somewhat artificial?  Like you didn't get \"real\" sleep but rather medically-induced sleep?  Just wondering.",

Fat cells are estrogen factories!  I was talking to my gyn about this and when you lose weight, numerically the number of fat cells you have does not go down.   She said that although that is true, the smaller they get the less estrogen they can make.  Interesting point...motivating point...our fat cells are now trying to kill us...great!   Can someone get me some kale and swiss chard?!?!? Warning on tamox bottle: this morning when I was calling CVS to refill my tamox I happened to be reading the warnings on the label.  One of them says \"herbal products may interact with this drug.  Discuss with DR or RPH.\"  I thought I would pass that on.  I know many of you take supplements etc... and perhaps finding out what herbs might interact with tamox negatively would be worthwhile. Lady: I hope after your walk you got some news about your path report.   Please let us know.  BTW, husband that cooks or not (I know how you feel....my last fiance cooked very well...not good!) you will get the weight off as soon you get a reprieve from this madness.  For you more than anyone, this has been a seemingly non-stop event.   Give yourself a little break and keep walking!  It is good for the soul. Sptmm: one more thing: no pressure but I would like to see you on the cover of \"Shape\" so get crackin' woman!  OFF TO THE FREEWEIGHTS AREA you shall go!   Zumba: that is all I can say!   Actually, if you go to Amazon and buy the box set that comes with the \"maracas!\" and you will also get 5 discs: a 55 minute cardio, a 55 minute tone, a 20 minute basic, a lengthy instructional so you can learn all the moves and a live cardio session that was filmed in a zumba studio.   Fun stuff.  If you simply do an hour of Zumba and 45 minutes on the treadmill, good health is your's.

Are you definitely getting them down at the same time? On brows and lashes, my brows thinned and I may have lost a few lashes. I am really glad I was spared the full monty on hair loss! JSW: GREAT PIC! You look fantastic! I am not even sure you need hair! I mean it is nice to have as it keeps our heads warm...! It is such a ruckus to pick up and move. I know you have to. I don't know what the family situation is like where you are at, but if you don't have people to come over and help you pack, in NYC I used a temp agency who sent over workers to pack the whole place...good stuff! Also, some moving companies, like the ones my mother's employer used, come in and pack and move your entire house. I know it might seem costly but, and although my mother never paid for any of that, it is such a relief to have others do it. In any case, best of luck on the house sale. Ckptry: I would say I have 98% sensation in my upper arm and pit area on the cancer side. That is why I can feel that packing discomfort but I am not worried about it. It is amazing that I have so much feeling. Rippling is par for the course. I am only pretty sure I am going to have it and am totally not worried about it. After this entire trip, my last concern is rippling! The thought that my pre-bc breasts were soon going to turn into knee warmers, and reach penant flag status on their way there, I will take no more bras, no more mammos and rippling any day! Calamtykel: yes, I do think about the 1 year anniversary. My trip to Ireland was cancelled b/c of bc so I definitely think about it. I don't give a ___ about a stupid trip; my life is way more important but it is a dual-reminder shall I say. I dread tax season every year. One thing I did was keep very good files on all medical stuff last year. I had to b/c I knew about all the write-offs and I am so glad I did not make things hard on myself. What I did misplace, like a total jackass, was a few of the tax statements from brokerage accounts. I cannot believe it. I have been hunting high and low for those. So aggravated. BTW, OMAZ has been officially promoted to \"IT Director\" for our thread! Thanks for making our lives easier! Well, I have to go study biology now! Good day, all",

Lady: thinking of you and may all go very well for you tomorrow.   Adey: congrats on being done with rads!  Super big YAY!!! Lisa: I am going to do some relays here in CT this summer with a friend who is a 2x cancer survivor.  $1800 is a lot but if it is not until the summer, and you could start now, it is entirely feasible you could raise that much.  I would try my best to raise the funds and, if you fall short, at least you tried.  This economy is so unforgiving, it could well be a daunting task.  Good luck. Question for the truly committed pre-kindle readers: did you all move to a kindle and, if so, how do you like it?  I *like* traditional books.   I know for traveling etc.. a kindle is nice but for just relaxing and reading, I like a book.   The only reason I bring this up is now I am reading \"Team of Rivals\" which is a book about Lincoln winning his presidency and forming a cabinet of all his rivals, just as Obama did in many ways.  In any case, it is a thick book and last night I was thinking a kindle might be nice right now!   So, has anyone who regularly reads gone to a kindle and how do you like it?",

I know everyone is busy etc... but I am going to send you a PM regarding an event that is coming up that perhaps you might want to be aware of.   From the time my friend's mother had her breasts removed and was released from the hospital to basically go home to die circa 1976, we have come a long way.  The women who have gone before us have fought and paved the way for us and have fought for where we are today.   When the George Washington Bridge was built, the primary concern was travel, of course.  Over the years, however, complacency and abuse led to egregious tolls and now it costs some $13 to get into NY via the GW.  If we become complacent and just ignore the fact there are still many, many issues plaguing women w/bc, they will be paying tolls going forward and many are today, in one form or another.  We must continue to fight. Perhaps I have more fight in me as my grandfather was in politics and my aunt still is and has been for over 30 years.  I might have politics in my blood and have had no compunction about sending letters directly to President Obama about the disgusting behavior of capitalistic pig doctors in this questionable healthcare system we have.  I have no compunction about continuing to shine the light on the profiteers and \"toll takers\" who think nothing of capitalizing on this disease by lining their pockets with our pain.  I have no problem explaining in letters to our president how some are just mugging and raping bc patients financially and keeping \"special\" services on a shelf that not too many can reach. That is me, however.  I am not asking any of you to do much more than pay attention to the PM and mark your calendars. A fellow \"thread-mate\" --so, sue me...I making up words!-- made me aware of this issue.  I will fight until the day I die for rights of women with breast cancer and to purge our healthcare system of the profiteers and the punks.   My experience has galvanized me in a way I did not even think was possible.  That is me but we can all do small things and I am not talking walking 47 miles so Komen can fatten up their political coffers.  I just want us to do one thing that is in the interests of the millions of women who are most definitely going to join us, and do every day, in this battle for our lives. Check your PMs and some day the office I will run for is \"Mayor\" of the Pink Brigade!!! Good day- ",

I also found several more squirrels living in my shed and that is just fine with me! I think I saw at least 10 chipmunks today also! I think they are adorable! Sptmm: I have a question about running. I know you were doing Zumba etc... but I want to know if you noticed an appreciable difference in weight loss once you started running? I used to run but I felt that by this point in my life I would have found something that was less jarring on my joints but I am fast starting to realize, and just like Rachel said, between Tamox and the hormonal changes post-bc, my metabolism is just not what it once was and that was not too great! Eating those 5 or 6 meals a day works but I don't *like* to eat all that much. I just feel with that plan that I am eating and eating and eating and it drives me crazy! I am just starting to think I really do have to get back to running. I don't even think about power walking anymore as I just want to run. I want to run to save my life! Tell me your thoughts. I suspect I already know the answer and that is that running sped up your metabolism quite a bit. On hair, another 4\" and I will be happy. Of course that is roughly 1 more year! I do have to say, my hair already feels longer since my \"Mane and Tail\" use! Rachel: it is nothing short of sad that our dreadful healthcare system even has you joking about sending us some meds!!!!!! Go Canada!!! I am sure you find it pretty disgusting that poor Timothea is on chemo and can't get her nausea meds. Our healthcare system is challenged. As for slow weight loss, I am doing the numbers and if I take in 1400 calories, I have to burn 2800 to lose. This is armchair analysis on efforts since the end of chemo. I guess I am just going to live on the Arc Trainer! I will work up to running for 1 hour and then will do the Arc Trainer for 1.5 hours and that should equal roughly 2500+ burned. #goodtimes I am just finding it very hard to lose weight without these herculean efforts and very strict diet. I would encourage everyone to lift weights as that will eat calories also. Go out and run with the kids! That will definitely help you as their ridicule will light your fire!!! My nephew, who surpassed me in height by age 13 and grew to 6'3\", always asked me to play basketball with him! Of course this was so he could make fun of me as he was very tall and very lanky! It did fire me up a bit!! Here is the \"Mane and Tail\" link: http://www.walmart.com/ip/Mane-n-Tail-Shampoo-Body-32-fl-oz/10293243 Tex: did you get your meds?  Please tell me this happened for you.  I find it awful you may have to continue for even one more day without it.  Please let me know because I WILL mail you some.  Apples: I wanted to use my juicer to make apple juice. I was at Stop and Shop and found this cute little bag of little apples that were grown solely for the purpose of fitting comfortably in a child's hand. In any case, after juicing some apples I decided that it was way, way, way too sweet. There I was still with roughly 8 apples left and I really don't eat reds too much. I love Granny Smith apples as those are my favorite. Well, I refuse to throw away fruits or veg as I perceive that high crime! I decided to cut up an apple and put some natural peanut butter on each little slice. It is my new favorite snack! In related news, my ability to make sushi at home is very much marred by my inability to effectively make that rice! I am going to cave and get a rice cooker but I did not want to because I now feel like a failure!!  At one time I could really make that rice pretty well!   OMG...only in CT! Someone called *911* because they did not LIKE the way their SANDWICH was made at a local deli!  If we get any more high strung here...!  Happy weekend, girls! ",

Meant to tell you all on the Dr. Oz Ovarian Cancer show, he pointed out that pap smears *do not* screen for ovarian cancer. Perhaps you all knew that paps were just for cervical issues but I thought I would point this out. It was news to me. In fact, sad to say, I never really knew exactly what the pap was for! Sptmm: you make me so proud with your Motley Crue and AC/DC!!!!! That is a great idea to do the Revlon next year. Even with surgery punctuating my training, I can pick it up again in the fall and be ready. The Revlon is in April, right? As for grilled asparagus, here goes the recipe: 1 lb asparagus, 3 tbsp balsamic, 2 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp olive oil, 1 tbsp low sodium soy sauce, 1/8 tsp black pepper. Snap the end off of the asparagus, combine all ingredients in a Ziploc, seal and marinate for 30 minutes. Discard the marinade and put the asparagus on the grill. Of course the recipe calls for spraying the grill w/cooking spray. What I do in lieu of that is just use a vegetable grill basket which is much easier. Grill 5 mins on each side and it is delicious! Enjoy! Deb, with the insurance stuff with your dd, I was just watching Obama about how 3 mil kids are now on their parent's insurance plans that were not before. I don't know what that means. Have they extended the amount of time kids can be on their parent's insurance? Was just wondering if that was some of the bureaucracy you were experiencing. This healthcare they are proposing is starting to sound like no-fault insurance in that we are required to pay for a policy that basically we will never be able to use. Scary, scary, scary. Rachel: congratulations on completing the first day of Couch! Must feel good! I hope that you can make it down to NYC to do the Revlon with us next year! I think Deb has a great idea on that one. I know you have been using Mane and Tail for a short period but wondering if you notice a difference? I have been using it for about 3 weeks and I already notice a difference! It is great. Enjoy your vaca, woman!   Iowa: sad story about your DIL's mom. How scary. I don't know what the healthcare issue answer is in this country but they saw this coming some 30 years ago. I love the way the govt finger-wags at us telling us how to manage our money and invest for retirement when they basically sold us to China with their bond-issuing to cover their massive, massive over-spending. This is why your DIL's mom is sitting around with no healthcare. It is a shame. I hope she is able to fight this and move on with her life. Ladyinbama: you never told us if you got the job that you inadvertently applied for ½ naked!!!!!!! I guess you did as you have not been around! I am glad you guys found the blood-donating news helpful.  I was surprised myself.  I will most likely start donating again next year.    Well, I have fallen in love with the grill again! Of course the push button starter is intermittent so I have taken to lighting it with the lighter in the side hole even though I know the replacement part is just a short ride away at Home Depot! In any case, last night I singed my hair! I had it back in a pony tail but some wild hairs in front had gotten lose and they were partially burned off! So sad! Good day- ",

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2012 01:51AM - edited Jul 6, 2012 02:00AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors!  Geesh, with all this insurance talk I realize we are all fighting for our insurance and our lives every day (sans our friends from Canada)!!  It is a mess and it just might be getting messier before better.    Speaking of healthcare, found this little ditty this morning: Now it's Congressional hopeful Chris Collins' turn, and not only does he seem to be a Trekkie, he ALSO seems to think that people do not die of certain kinds of cancers any more! Ready? READY?? Via The Batavian: The healthcare reforms Collins said he would push would be tort reform and open up competition in insurance by allowing policies across state lines. Collins also argued that modern healthcare is expensive for a reason. \"People now don't die from prostate cancer, breast cancer and some of the other things,\" Collins said. \"The fact of the matter is, our healthcare today is so much better, we're living so much longer, because of innovations in drug development, surgical procedures, stents, implantable cardiac defibrillators, neural stimulators - they didn't exist 10 years ago. The increase in cost is not because doctors are making a lot more money. It's what you can get for healthcare, extending your life and curing diseases.\" I just thought you all would be happy to know, according to this congressional hopeful, no one is dying of breast cancer anymore!!!!!  This country, when it comes to profiteering, will come out wiht the craziest S in an attempt to keep that money train rolling.  It is all so ridiculous.  We are constantly seeing \"angel\" postings on this site.  Perhaps Collins should check this site before making such cavalier statements. I also think someone needs to knock on Mr. Collins head and alert him to the idea we do NOT have the best healthcare in the world and that, by that yardstick, we are pretty low on that totem pole, down near #10 (every country ahead of us has socialized medicine)....yeah, great healthcare system we have!  The increase is from doctors and insurance companies making more money and relegating the un and/or underinsured to the black hole of few or no options outside of a hospital.  Anywhere in this country where there is much resistance there is always a lot of money involved.  The last thing we need is more *competition* in insurance!  We need one, unified, united healthcare system where we pay for it w/a payroll tax, just like we do social. Rachel: on that note, another point of interest for you on our abysmal healthcare: our plans are grotesquely fragmented in that if you are from NY and are on vaca in CA and get hurt, unless you work for one of the largest employers in this country(even then there is no guarantee), it is all but guaranteed your insurance will not cover your treatment in CA!!!!!  Seriously, so wish I was joking!   Ginger: I am not a big cruiser.  It has been some 9 years since I cruised and I did not send ahead.  The next one I would (and want to) do is Alaska.  I briefly thought of doing the QE2 to England but couldn't find my gladstone bag!!!  Glad you had a nice holiday! Enjoy the day, girls!   ",

It is 73 degrees, down from 103 w/88% humidity yesterday!  Deb, last night CT was totally like a sauna!  I am with you, thought it was supposed to cool things off but today more than makes up for that!  Calamtykel: did you decide on the BW or scans? Just wondering how you are doing with that. It just seemed weird that your onc seemed to feel there was no change in your markers but yet spoke of a spike and the desire to scan? Perhaps I misunderstood. Sptmm: you know, I used to be able to just run for 45 minutes to an hour and it felt great. I think you know I worked in WTC and my boyfriend worked for Cantor and was killed in 9/11. At that time I was in good shape and I hate to tell you this next part but some of what is motivating me now is the fact we could be subject to another terrorist attack. I think to be able to save myself, I need to be able to run at least 3 miles. I really need to be in good shape. Right now, with the pathetic struggles I am having with the Couch, all I can think is if I was in this kind of shape on 9/11, and was in my office as I should have been, I very well might have perished if I was in this kind of shape. That leads me to my next point: the other night I am laying on the floor in the living room and thinking I now know what they mean about being over 40. Everything hurts a little more, it is wicked hard (be it post-chemo or post-40 etc..) to get in really good shape. Crosstraining over 40 to achieve optimal fitness might be a 3 hour per day commitment. I can't believe all the stuff I do, and can do, and yet am struggling with the 2nd week of the couch. I don't get it. One thing I can say is once I get back there, I will never go \"here\" again. Walking and zumba and the upright bike and the recumbent bike and the arc etc.... are all great but nothing gets your body in as good shape as running does and therefore it is challenging. Deb, as for Tex, her silence is indicative of her most likely doubling her training efforts! Her kids are no doubt doing sand art in the daycare at the gym where she is training!! We are onto her tricks! Sweating: those hot flashes persist and they are wicked. I gave up on PJs a long time ago...just do the sheets a lot! My sleep sucks, too. I am like you with the water. In fact, aside from 2 cups of coffee in the morning, that is all I drink. That is a long day in an office building, where feeling parched is a byproduct of the recycled air. It is just one day, however! You can do it! Omaz: that is so great that she drove to school!! It is so exciting!!! I loved those days...I remember walking out of high school, with my friends Lori and Melissa, and having the vice principal calling after us saying \"girls, wait, you are heading the wrong way! Last period is this way!!!\" No, we were heading home to lay by the pool! The joy of having a car at 16! Consequently, this surely will not be your dd. I was a wild child, woman! Four doc appts?! Best of luck on all of that! Wow...that is a cluster...well, I won't finish that! Ckptry: thanks for stopping by to advise Kel on those tumor markers! Ask and ye shall receive! How are things going w/Aidan? I hope you had some success with the therapist. Necessary Roughness is on USA not TBS!!!!  Good day, girls-  ",

Omaz: I think you mentioned that PrivateLabs before. That is great information, thank you. With the way things could go re: healthcare companies, I think we are going to need all the DIY leads we can get. Calamtykel: glad you are going to wait on the BW. It is wicked crazy that all of these scans and they still can't accurately pinpoint cancer. There were some firm developments with the cancer breathalyzer recently at a Jewish Medical Center in Colorado. Also they don't use cancer sniffing dogs much because there is no way/organization to take care of them at the hospital. I don't know why there is not a separate center where the cancer-sniffing dogs are kept. For that same reason, bomb-sniffing dogs are not widely used at airports. I really hope they either get the breathalyzer on the fast track for approval or there is a dog center we could visit. It is just nothing short of obfuscating that there is not YET a less cancer-causing way to look for cancer. Kel, PrivateMedLabs CAN provide it in CT however!!! If you take the Garden State to 287 and pick up the Merritt off 287 North, you can be in Stamford w/in a few hours from most points in NJ. If you search 06902 the first 3 that come up are border towns in CT. Something to consider.  Tex: get your dance on!!!! I love that song! That and \"Red, red wine\" came out that same summer! My friend had a beatle with the straight pipe sticking up out of the back like a cat tail! Those songs bring me back to one heck of a great summer! Timothea, if you rent a car with unlimited miles and drive over to FL (I know my brother does this drive from Houston all the time), you can get cruises to the Bahamas out of JVille, Daytona, Ft Lauderdale etc.. for like $300. It is only 50 miles off the coast of FL. A friend of mine was telling me the other night he took a Disney cruise through Alaska and how wonderful it was. I was cringing!!!! I was thinking Norwegian as I want to do an Alaska cruise. He was encouraging me to go Disney!!!! No, absolutely not! My BAL would be 3.0 for the duration! As for your training (stories), Deb and I are only pretty sure you are cranking it out!! My nephew was telling me the other night how old I am as he is 18. I was on the phone so I told him after I get my dentures in and take my arthritis med, I will be down there to show him what's what! He responded with \"your alzheimer's will most likely cause you to forget where you are going!\" In long, I might be old but not easily fooled! That is a shame about the camera. I am going to reveal what an antique I am with this next one! My friend's dad owned a pharmacy when we were teenagers. We worked pt for him and I think he probably would have preferrred to pay us to stay home! The pharmacy was in a very Italian town (like 99%!) and she and I would get the biggest kick out of these guys coming in with their shirts open to their navel with all their gold chains, wreaking of \"stench of the night\" cologne and with some pop tart hanging off their arm! We had this one guy that came in a few times with like 5-20 dollar bills and asked for a $100 bill!! So sad. In any case, the pertinent part of the story is people used to have to bring their film to places like pharmacies to get them developed. It normally took like a week to get them back. Well she and I used to have some fun mixing up the pictures!!! We would take like 2 from one roll and put them in someone else's!! We were so awful! People would come back with questions and we would poker face it and tell them it must have been a mix up at the lab!!!! Timothea, are you grateful that technology has taken juvenile punks out of the equation!? As for my story, you should back your camera up constantly now that you know how bad we all used to have it and how little privacy! Did you find out your PET numbers? Just wondering what they were. I am so embarrassed to tell you all this story but I must as it is pretty funny! Yesterday I met my pal for lunch and then we went to Sam's Club which all of you all with kids probably know what that is! For those that don't, it is a big warehouse where you can buy like a 400lb can of pineapple etc... and like everything is sold in huge bulk. I had never even been in it before yesterday. In any case, her dh met us and he wanted to check some things out so we ended up in that store for like 2 hours! It was ok though b/c it was all kind of new to me! Around 5 they opened up tons of these sample carts so we were all trying this stuff. Bottom line, I was kind of forgetting I was standing in a store as I had been there seemingly forever now! I guess I have developed this \"habit\" since I have no boobs of putting my hand inside the v-neck area of my tank top and sort of using it like a sling to support my hand (mind you the neck of the shirt is tight so it is not like my hand drags it down, exposing \"nothing!)!! I just let it rest there and I had no idea I was doing it in the aisle of this warehouse place! My friend is like \"are you still going to do that after you get some new ones?!\" I simply explained it was a new, albeit weird, habit and perhaps one I will have to stop shortly! I further explained if we had not been in that warehouse store for hours, my mind would not be sending me signals thinking I was in the comfort of my own home! Well, much love to all of you! Hope everyone is having a good weekend!",

      "Content": "Jul 24, 2012 11:53AM - edited Jul 24, 2012 11:54AM by 1WonderWoman Good day warriors- One of these days you all should get on Twitter. You don't have to tweet but you should just get an account and then search \"cancer research\" and get in the flow of all the information out there. All these little tidbits I post, including what I am going to post today, I find out about through Twitter. I know most of you FB but for the more private, frenetic crowd (!), Twitter is where it is at especially for receiving information. Plus on FB a lot of information is lost because of voluminous postings by the bored and uninspired! You all might just want to get on Twitter. I know we all fall into that false sense of security in thinking our oncs are somehow ubiquitous and all-knowing about what is going on in cancer research but that is just not the case. Some of the stuff you learn about on Twitter might very well save your life. Something else is that I am not \"constantly\" on Twitter although I do have it on my phone. I can only imagine how much information I am missing b/c I may check my last 50 tweets when I get on. If we are all on, we might be able to check-and-balance each other b/c something you all might see I may have missed etc... I guess I would like to create a virtual research team! So this morning I was on Twitter and found this information out about \"Afinitor.\" Apparently it has been being used for liver and pancreatic cancer. It has shown promise in trials for bc. Here goes the link and remember, to use these shortened links, right click and select \"open in a new tab\": http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-22/breast-cancer-halted-by-novartis-drug-from-easter-island I think it is all good information. I also wanted you all to read the article and check out how they write about all these \"profits\" Novartis stands to make if this is approved and how, like in some whacky tale from Masters of the Universe, they are going to take down Roche (I think) who I guess is the major \"winner\" in cancer drug manufacturing. I appreciate the information but I despise the fact that profits are the major theme of the article and, yes, I do realize it is a \"Business Week\" article! In our capitalistic society, however, if they are not making money, they most likely will not do anything so that is just the way it is. Omaz: well, I guess you and I will be chatting alone! I will look forward to it! Good day-",

I have pillows loaded up around and atop a bed rest pillow. Not too shabby, girls! Not too shabby! A few times I woke up and did not know where I was...scary. I also wake up sweating (thank you my return-to-tamoxifen benefits!) and can't get the sheet/blanket off fast enough! I mean like I throw it off. Aside from this stuff, trucking along! Thank you all for well wishes. Final path should be back w/in few weeks...trying not think about it! Tex: I LOVE THOSE PICS!!!!!! What a beautiful family and the kids are so darn cute!!! I am so happy for you! I also am so in awe of your dedication to make memories for the kids as even with your chemo infusions, you are still making time to take them camping, to the pool etc.... I think you might be \"Mother of the Century!\" Seriously, my hat goes off to you, girl. I don't know how you do it and it is just so wonderful that you do! The kids will never forget these summer good times you create for them! Speaking of making memories, my father was a single father in the late 1970s. Well, my bff from childhood, and the one who is now a therapist at Yale and who I woke up to telling me everything was going to be ok, got to talking with me the next night when I was up sitting. She remarked on how her mother, being a single mother of 3 children, and my father sort of balanced each other out and were able to provide a nice infrastructure for us kids being neighbors and all. My father, I can't even count how many times, took myself, my neighbor, and stepsister to all the state parks and a whole bunch of different places nearly every summer weekend and how he would pick us up from rollerskating at midnight etc... She told me what a great part of her life he was and how he served to fill that gap her own father left when he failed to come around after the divorce. I was so happy to hear my father helped her have some nice childhood memories and that how important those memories were. I felt it necessary to remind you when, at a time when you are totally emptying your energy bank to make sure they have some good times, how much they will totally cherish those good times ;) It will really mean so much to them later in life. You are a great, and selfless, mom, Timothea. Sptmm: Lizzy is resting!!!! In fact, it is arguably my new \"favorite!\" Rachel: I think they were a little upset over that game as well but the Canadians sure won their fair share of medals! This summer Olympics has been great! Sweeney: I find if I want to get attacked by a bear, just put some sirloin tips in the pockets of your shorts and hanging off your belt, and that should work! Seriously, glad you had some cottage time and a nice little summer break! I love summer and that is also why I did a lot in the May - July stretch because I knew once surgery was here, summer over :( I cannot believe N Quebec got to 98 degrees?! What will Santa do?! OMG, the afternoon news reported 5 banks were robbed and there was a deadly home invasion...I can't believe this is Connecticut!  This is all so surreal. It is just about nap time again!

I also did a load of laundry today so, on that note, this was a big, big day for me! Tex: You know I am so happy you finally got your niece and nephew ;) Speaking of \"tinkling,\" right after surgery I was having \"will I make it\" moments and the nurses reminded me to always be doing my \"kegel\" exercises! They do work! Hopefully you can get some nice naps in while all the kids are at school tomorrow! That would definitely be my goal. Rachel: best of luck on your scans and mammo this week. I am kind of surprised you are having so much trouble with synthroid but then again I started it some 7 years ago and I just can't remember if I had trouble. As for me, I think there is a reason I have been through so much. I must be here to let others know what they might expect or to teach others in some way. Sorry to hear about your friend from the support group. Everything about cancer is tough to deal with and certainly departure from such is the hardest of all. I feel for you. Congratulations on your new niece! Sptmm: you know, that is a very good point about getting the flap done and then feeling \"allowed\" to move forward in some way is a real issue. You don't realize how much the constant reminder of being lopsided or w/out locks you into the entire experience daily. As for the surgery, days 5-7 will deliver the coveted news of there being zero chance of a blood clot! That was my absolute favorite day of all! I was riddled with trepidation about the potential for blood clots. Those first few days post-surgery are a little scary for that reason. As for what to have on hand, I would get a little basket or tote and put some Neosporin, a thermometer, bandaids, ace bandages (for the drains), safety pins, scissors and also have some Dulcolax on hand just in case as you know the pain meds. They should give you docusate sodium when you first leave the hospital to counter balance the effects of the pain med but when you finish that it is helpful to have something like dulcolax on hand. The hospital gave me some ice packs to go but if you don't have any at home, get some. Also have some prune juice on hand. The first movement after surgery was awful. The length of the surgery combined with the pain meds when you are still in the hospital make that situation very difficult. I was just glad they were not trying to keep me until I performed!!!! Ckptry: cute avatar! You look so young!! Well, time for another nap!!!!!! Here we go off to nap city! Happy trails, girls-",

Rachel: you must have felt like crap going into the thyroid dx. You also must have been scared it mets/recurrence. I am so glad it worked out like that. As for the coming up on the med, sure, that is going to be rough b/c you are basically starting at zero. They have to totally get you back to appropriate levels strictly through meds so that is going to take its toll for a bit. I would say w/in 6 weeks you should be ok but seriously, with kids and your schedule and all, that must seem like a lifetime. I hope it goes quicker and easier for you than that. Don't forget to let us know the results of your mammo and US ASAP! May the force be with you! I hope you have a great, long weekend! Sweeney: when do you get your bone scan results?

This drain allows big, long clots to come out and then they get caught in the drain spout (where I empty it from) and the other night I had to break a Q-Tip in ½ and use the stick covered in a sterile prep square to clean it out and it was all these little pieces of a clot and I almost vomited! My appetite is still not back as I whatever I eat I feel sits in my throad and this whole clot thing is just killing me...so gross! So it is in this way I discovered nursing is definitely not for me! Any more of these cleanings and I will most likely be on protein drinks for quite a while! There was a JKL rerun on and Robert Pattinson was one of the guests. I am totally not a vampire movie fan and have never seen any of his work but he seems very intelligent and thereby quite an entertaining individual.

I live in the Northeast, as you all know, and more to this point, there is a strong Italian influence. We have so many carnivals and festivals surrounding Italian heritage and/or religiosity, there are many, many treats to be had! In any case, at the summer carnivals, which are normally held on the grounds of a church, there is always fried dough. People eat fried dough with either sugar and cinnamon or w/gravy (Italian tomato sauce) and grated parm. That Beavertail reminds me of the fried dough w/cinnamon and sugar we can get all summer at these carnivals. Also, if any of you are ever in New York in September you must go to the \"Feast of San Gennaro\" in the Bronx to get a good idea of how deep the Italian food roots run in the boroughs and, in particular, the Boogie Down!!!! The Yankees are breaking my heart and the debates are wildly entertaining!!! I am glad I have 7 TVs in my house b/c last night there was something different on in 4 rooms! It is 50 degrees here today and I am freezing! Sweeney and Rachel: last night I came across a link regarding the best and safest place for women to live in the world and, you guessed it: CANADA!!!!! If I could better handle the cold, I just might move north! I was surprised to read how many women have I think what are politically appointed positions as judges. I think it was about 53% of judges in that particular respect are women. They also cited healthcare as being one of the cornerstones of women's health and safety in Canada. Good for you girls!!!! Rachel: an old acquaintance lives in MN. Cold, cold but then you are used to that! Seems so odd to go from MN to Denmark but should be a nice trip anyway!!! Of course I get tired thinking about it! Don't forget to go to the Mall of America! In NYC everyone refers to the \"Museum of Modern Art\" as MOMA and, of course, people refer to that massive ode to capitalism as MOA! The \"M\" that is missing from the MOA to the MOMA might as well stand for Mensa!!!!! Wha ha ha!!!!! Coastal elite humor! Sounds to me with those 7 kids running around the house, you will be welcoming a nice trip to the US and then Denmark! Hope he has a wonderful 11th birthday and you are able to maintain your sanity! Sounds like fun nonetheless!   Rachel and Sweeney: I follow Martha Plimpton (\"Raising Hope\" among other things) on Twitter. She forward this link last night and you should check it out. It is a very distinct myopic view into the disgusting underbelly of this gross capitalistic healthcare system we have: indypendent.org/2012/10/11/col... This is *actually* happening in the United States. It is disgusting. This, consequently, is not much different than many other parts of this country where people don't have coverage, are denied coverage and are falling under the auspices of what many in the south want to be a reuniting of \"church and state\" so as to gain better control of all things ovarian. I hope everyone has a nice weekend. Things are officially very fall-like here as they should be. The Yankees are in game 5 with the Orioles of the ALDS which I was nothing short of stunned that such a talented team could not put together 1 run and close it out last night. Alas I digress! Here we go as this will be a 2 television night! One for the Yankees and 1 for \"Shark Tank!\" Yes, I used to be roaming around midtown Manhattan, partying and complaining that Happy Hour is just too short when we reached the 7:30ish hour and now I am normally making pizza, drinking cabernet sauvignon and watching \"Shark Tank!\" My oh my, my life has changed immensely! Truth be known, I was at a high producers dinner at \"Morton's\" in Manhattan with one of the owners of the firm and he remarked that night how he used to love to party and roam the wild streets of NY as well but how things had changed so much and now he went home to his house on LI and played chess online with varying aged competitors from around the world. I can now identify with having crossed that line however I just don't know where it was!!!! Happy trails, girls-",

They seem to be struggling and now with their Captain out for the rest of the season w/a broken ankle, they will either do really well or really badly. I don't think there is any in-between on this one. In any case, all my Yankee gear is Jeter and I have been a fan of his since the day he started playing. My positive thoughts will be going his way until I see him in Spring training!!! Adey: Psychedelic Furs and Lemonheads?

A friend who lives in Mass and spends some time on the Cape in summer was saying how Taylor Swift dating the Kennedy boy caused so much paparazzi and security ruckus, they left the Cape early! All I can say is I love her music, think she is wicked talented and when I saw her marching around on the VMA stage singing \"We Will Never Get Back Together,\" all I could think was she must be blowing his 18 year old mind!!! Meanwhile he just started his Junior year in HSin Massachusetts!!!!!! GO TAYLOR!!!!!!! I think she started dating him \"openly\" the day of his 18th birthday this past July and I can see why as he has got those Kennedy very good looks! Can you imagine being in an uber posh prep school with all the Kennedy expectations on your shoulders, watching your girlfriend prance around the VMA stage in LA and thinking \"great, I am locked in this private school cage for another 2 years!!!!!!!!\"  Curious to see how long this one lasts and what song she will write when it ends...if it ends!!

Here is the \"Center for Disease Control\" link if anyone wants to see the bc incidence map: http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/statistics/state.htm Good day, girls-",

Omaz is right also as you need protein: chicken, shrimp, nuts, eggs, egg whites, even protein powder you can get at like Target is good for making sure you are getting enough protein.  You can buy a 2 lb jug of protein powder at Target for like $18 and make shakes out of it with milk, chocolate syrup and even add ice cream if you want!  Just make sure you get that protein in you however you can. Drinking water is really important and the Vitamin C is good so keep that up ;) Lady: you know, you are right and I need to read some more of his books!  I am going to check them out next week.  Omaz: I thought Tex had posted here.  She has a biopsy due to the results of her xray earlier this week.  I feel bad even saying something.  I wish everyone well and I hope you all have the sweetest of dreams :)",

Felis: I hope you are doing well today!  Check in and let me know how you are doing.  Also, last nigth when I was in the basement doing hurricane prep I came across my artifical tree (my father who scared us about fire also made us nervous about real trees so I go fake!) and thought of you.  The first year when I was dxd and having lost my job, my breasts, going through chemo I was much better off than most people but I definitely need a pick-me-up.  I put my Xmas tree up in MID-OCTOBER!!!  Not joking!  It cheered me up so if you like holidays decorations and you need a pick-me-up, perhaps you should do what I did!  I don't even think I posted about that but how I love sitting at night with the lights off and enjoying the glow of those Xmas lights! Oh, as for the ex's, 2 know about bc and 2 I never told.  The 2 that know are probably checking to see if it killed me yet and the other 2 are probably calling to see if I am still alive in hopes the hurricane takes me!!!!!  Speaking of men a guy I have not seen in a while and who does not know about bc saw me recently and asked if I got a BOOB JOB!!!!!  So gross!  I still did not tell him about the bc b/c I am kind of private about it now but funny how they think! Yeah, I guess you could call it a boob job! Well, the moral to this story is now if someone I see did not know I had bc, these new boobs are helping me sidestep even talking about it!  They really feel just like the old ones!!  I was going out with this guy when I was like 19 and he was only 21 but he asked me once \"are these alive or dead??!!!\"  I explained dead and he quickly moved on!  Mine never had much sensation at all so I am just fine with these!  To be honest, I am so happy they can do this for us and it is just my own body fat, just like the old jokers!

Tex: the \u201cboobie\u201d tshirts, I have seen them but it never really registered with me.  The porn nonsense and 1 penny!?   A lot of people like porn but please, don\u2019t drag our disease into it. I can just hear men around the country telling their partners/spouses they are supporting bc research with this crap! I don\u2019t know if I told you (everyone else here) this but I signed myself out of the hospital AMA in August when I had **8** open holes in my body, they put me in gen pop and not the cancer hospital and I wanted *out* of there before I got MRSA etc\u2026  My GP told me there are cases where people had no clue they even had it but one test or another reveals they do.  When I was telling them I was leaving the hospital as they were attempting to keep me pending an out-patient procedure, I told them I wanted out before I got an infection.  They basically told me I would have to have sex with a guy on the floor who had MRSA for me to contract it!  I asked them to just leave my room at that point!  It is ubiquitous and much easier to catch than what they say.  I sure hope you don\u2019t have it.  That is why I got the heck out of there as my situation is already complicated enough never mind adding MRSA to the mix.  Hopefully it is a simple rash.  Right now, and since the hospital, I have a rash on both thighs and my stomach is dry and wicked itchy.   Of course, off to the derma I go.  It takes months to get a derma appt in this part of the country but they try to get me in as quick as possible.  I was kind of hoping it would just go away but all the exfoliating (both homemade and manufactured) and all the loofah-ing followed my moisturizing with both olive oil and manufactured moisturizers and not having success.  Thanks for the tip, though, as I will NOT google MRSA in the interim!!! I don\u2019t blame you for going off.  I have heard a lot of stuff but using bc to increase porn traffic? That even surprised me at how low some people will go when it comes to money.  I say good luck because when the next terrible thing happens to them I hope they will remember they messed with people with cancer.  I did not give out candy tonight.  There is not one child even living on my street.  The entire street, sans a few older couples and one other couple, is all singles.  Last year I just ended up with bags of candy which I gave to my friend to take to his church. Hope everyone had a wonderful Halloween!  I used to have some fun before bc came and attacked me!  One of my fav things to do is go to the Village parade in NYC and then go to Webster Hall but certainly I was not going to be able to do that this year.  Also my friend will be in NYC over Thanksgiving this year and I was planning to go to the parade.  I am really even having second thoughts about that now.  I am sure, however, NY will still have the parade.   Maybe 2013 will be health and weather uneventful and I can have some fun?!  Maybe, just maybe..!  Night, all-",

I hope everyone is enjoying this day!  I am getting probably 4 catalogs per day (tis the season!) so last night I took 4 of them and perused them before dozing off.  I am not a big \u201cshopper\u201d but I did see one lighted poinsettia arrangement that is artificial, of course, and is about 3\u201d tall and shaped like a tree.  I lights up and is so pretty! The Christmas stuff is a weak spot for me! Tex: I may not have mentioned that I signed myself out.  At the time I was fielding so many questions from everyone from the VNA to Blue Cross, I might have thought it better to not post publicly what happened.  Bottom line, there was *no* need for me to be in that hospital and I had not eaten for 18 hours before I went and they kept me like that for another 18 hours and then wanted to start stabbing to find a vein!  I am without food and water for 36 hours, how are you going to get a vein?  I definitely identified with that part of your story!  I was admitted with the idea of being put back in the OR and belly drains put back in but then they decided to send me to another dept that would put a different kind of belly drain in.  Well I had been to that dept and they almost exclusively do out-patient procedures so I thought it was a total waste of my health insurance co money as well as putting me at risk for infection so I peaced out!  What really made me leave I was already in the hospital 1 day and all they got done was repeat a US I had done elsewhere 2 days prior.  In addition this curmudgeon of a male nurse I had told me that it was entirely feasible that I might sit there another 48 hours before they actually did the procedure.  I was like \u2013 NO, I am outtie! When I am leaving one of the nurses comes up and was near tears telling me she did not like the way they were handling things and gave me the number to patient relations which actually worked!  She told me I was going to need them to get the procedure booked properly.  As for the neighbor upstairs, the first time I ever lived with a guy we fell in love with a 2nd floor apt in an old Victorian.  A friend of his uncle\u2019s owned it.  Well we lasted a total of 5 months and never, ever again would I live in a place with people above or below me (well I did in NYC but alas I did not have a choice in NYC!!).  The uncle\u2019s friend was on his way into bankruptcy and the \u201cthing\u201d he had living on the 3rd floor had kids that rode those small big wheels in the house and then running and jumping and screaming and yelling all day and until late in the night.  The house fell into foreclosure by the end of month 2 and then she really let them rip.  She did not work, and we both worked, so it was just awful.  Bottom line, either that lady upstairs from you is high and doesn\u2019t even hear what they are doing or she is just a piece of crap.  I would not go up there and confront her.  It can only make things worse and you also don\u2019t know what you are dealing with. I can PM you the address of a place where I buy security cameras.  I have cameras all over my house which also record audio.  There has got to be a noise ordinance in that town, right?  I would spend a few bucks on a security device that records audio on an SD card and then one night when it is really crazy, call the local police and tell them it has been going on all night plus you have an SD card with the recordings from several other dates.  Of course you want to do this close to the time you are planning to move!  I know you are moving back to the SA area so I would tell you to if you are not prepared to buy then rent a house.  Don\u2019t go into those apt communities if you can avoid it.  They are the worst and I would never, ever again do that.  This is also one of the reasons I can\u2019t do city living.  I love working and experiencing city life but I absolutely need to be able to get away to somewhere quiet. She is just being rude and people that are that blatantly inconsiderate are simply miserable.   Rise above, girl, and work on getting back to the SA area.  Oh, something else: the devastation in NY, CT and NJ have a lot of politicians talking about the WPA.  If there is another WPA I would strongly encourage you to consider moving to the Northeast as there are great hospitals for you and your dh could easily get a security job esp now with the widespread problems that are going to take months and months to clean up and, of course, looting is rampant.  The cleanup is going to take years but, and a small bit of a silver lining, it will create lots of jobs.  All things to consider, girl.  I am so sorry for what you are going through b/c it would be nice if you could nap while the kids are in school and your dh works overnight, right?  I am sure he would like to get a little sleep also.  People are rude, Timothea.  Just rude. Make sure you let us all know how tomorrow goes and keep in touch with me throughout the day ;)  I will be thinking of you, pal! Donald Trump left the 1st floor of Trump Tower in NYC open to the public for the entire duration of Sandy and fed and kept everyone warm for free!  I was stunned!  So altruistic\u2026ah-mazing! I was really surprised actually. Good day, girls!",

Ginger: you are soooo right!!!!  I told you (et al) I have *no* maternal instincts!  Timothea was not saying that the noise was bothering her at all hours but she was worried about the child!  Geesh, thanks for knocking on my head!  Perhaps it is a bit of both but I think you are much closer to assisting her with what the actual question than I was!!   As for Staten Island, I am so disgusted.  My friend Kathleen lost her house and she, her dh and 2 kids are now having to go to Westchester and cram in w/her inlaws and they are the lucky ones.  Some people are going to be living indefinitely in a shelter.  Someone was describing it as if it is going to look like Haiti did after Katrina with that sort of tent housing set up.  It is incomprehensible that the firefighters and police officers who live on Staten Island and serve Manhattan, saving lives as a part of their jobs are being jilted at a time of such catastrophic loss.  Meanwhile back in Gotham Bloomberg is redirecting funds and power to the marathon.  It is really pretty gross.  Next week there are 2 supply drop-off locations for toiletries, canned goods and coats.  One is for CT and one is exclusively for Staten Island.  I will be stopping at both to donate goods.  Our gov also sent a National Guard helicopter and crew to NJ which I thought was a magnanimous gesture as a large part of this state has significant loss from Sandy. In CT they are taking care of everyone.  Of course those w/out power are still very upset but by and large, CT does take care of those affected by disasters like Sandy.  NJ seems to be doing the same but Bloomberg is dead wrong for doing that marathon crap this weekend and I would not be surprised if there is a melee as a result.  I don't know why Cuomo did not step in either to get SI the assistance they desperately need and/or to stop that marathon business.  The SI situation is in very, very poor taste. Sptmm: how are you feeling?  I hope you are not out running although I do wonder...! Good day, ladies  ",

Shows a lot of promise. Tex: I love that t-shirt!  I mean I did not understand what the nature police were doing trying to track down a bear.  First off, a bear is not going to have a clue what you are doing and why you are being aggressive when as far as the bear was concerned, that was a nice little dog meal on the path by the reservoir!  Like Ginger pointed out, if you just go your way, most likely the bear will do the same. I love all the animals!  All of them! I had a friend who purchased an Arabian horse that was NOT broken!  That thing was berserk.  His name was \"Bear!\" That was one Bear I did not want to have a gun! In any case, looney tunes invited me to the farm where she was boarding him to \"meet\" him!!!!!!  Holy smokes...he stood on his hind legs and made a bunch of \"I am really pissed off\" noises and she was staring, all 20 feet in the air and remarking how cute he was!  Where was I? About a hundred feet up a hill far away from her cute little Bear!  In long, I love all animals and some strictly from afar!  Timothea-put whatever pic you want!  Who cares if it was today or 10 years ago!  If you like it and feel it is representative of you then that is the pic you should use!  I mean look at me!  It was like 7 years ago I had that cat costume on with that apple on my head!!!!!! Felis: the swelling could take months.  Try ice packs.  It might help a little bit.  Please be careful with the diarrhea and vomitting b/c the 2 together can quickly lead to big trouble for you.  Try eating some rice or crackers and see if you can keep that down.  Also, any kind of nuts you like?  Even just maybe try peanut butter on crackers.  You need to be able to get some stuff in you that hopefully will stay.  If you can't keep anything down, you need to try Boost or Ensure.  They are both expensive even for a little 6 pack so call the manufacturer, tell them you have bc, are on chemo and that you would like them to help you.  I did that with Boost and they sent me some coupons.  I also called every major pharma when I volunteered with the elderly and I got them free meds quite a few times.  They will either send you coupons or might even send you some free samples.  Also don't forget I told you about the protein powder at Target.  If nothing else you should be able to keep down protein powder. OK, back to election madness!!!!!!  May I just add Barbara Walters looks fabulous!  Just fabulous! ",

Felis: I am so glad you are feeling better!  Just imagine how strong you will be going into that chemo after Thanksgiving?!   You know, I am happy you are going to be feeling good and strong so you can have a nice holiday.    Then hopefully your last one will be in Jan, after the holidays, and you will have been able to enjoy all holidays without feeling too sick or dragged down by chemo.  It all works out ;) Lady: I am so glad you had a nice time for yourself in Savannah!  Good for you!  Enjoy your sleep, woman! Ginger: someone I know asked what he could do with a bunch of money he wanted to spend helping NY, NJ and CT.  I advised *never* give money, always give products.   Money walks and you and I both know this.  You did the perfectly altruistic thing and you did the smart thing by sending needed tangibles, not money.  That was very thoughtful of you and so sweet!  Imagine how many are going to benefit from what you did.   Good stuff, woman! I think our nation is wildly stunned by mother natures\u2019 wrath over this past decade.  We have had hurricanes and storms in areas and disasters in places that never saw such carnage.  I just think FEMA is great but we still have a ways to go.  I just think we are getting used to mobilizing and getting things moving much more quickly.  No more bureaucracy with social media either.  Oh, btw, the Fairfield Beach event organized through social media and the evening news brought over a 1000 people!!!  That is just amazing how wonderful social media is manifesting.  Well, good day to you all!  Hope things are well-",

The heat wave is nearly over here!  Wow, I cannot believe how many people I saw wearing shorts yesterday...in Connecticut...in December!  It was truly anomalous! Ginger: that is hysterical!  Come along in my pockets!  I live in a very congested part of the country and at this time of year, all kinds of characters are out.  It was not until I went to visit a friend in Iowa some years ago that I realized what true \"country\" was all about.  I seemed I could reach out and touch the stars at night and it was oh so quiet.  Not here! We are all always scrambling about!  In any case, the 2 men were probably of the marrying age and one was saying he wants her to see him get married and that is when the other made that comment basically lending that the guy who said it was nowhere near matrimony!  People don't mean anything and they had no clue about my bc.  No harm, no foul! You, I think, will love Zumba!  It is fun and easy. Also, and this might sound weird but, I put an air mattress behind my treadmill so just in case I get dizzy or fall, I won't get killed flying into the wall behind me!  Tricks of living alone!!!   Honestly, before bc and chemo et al I never concerned myself with such things.  I just have never felt the same since going through all of that and I still get dizzy today. So if you are afraid you might fall while executing your jazzy Zumba moves, put an air mattress on the floor nearby or the couch cushions.  Better safe ;)  BTW, I wish I knew you wanted Zumba as I would have sent you my starter kit!  I have moved beyond it now. Before you ask, my headaches are soon to be investigated in the swallows of scan city!  More to come...!  Felis: my path with bc was so marred with problems and surgeries and infections and troubles, I know exactly how you feel. You just have to go through the motions and not get yourself too caught up in what you think might happen.  Don't speculate but rather just go with it.  After all the whole point of all the stuff we go through is to save our lives so, on that note, it is quite worth it. Also, when I get sad etc... I remind myself of 10 things I am grateful for and not the least of which is that I live here and not in Afghanistan or Iraq or Darfur where there would be no txs, no concern and almost guaranteed death from bc as we would never even have been dxd.  It is an awful dx, yes, but we are also very fortunate to be here where we are cared for and where our drs are diligent, well-educated and working to save lives.  I know it is hard but I am also glad they are planning to get the water out, to clean out that area and to get you patched up so you can complete chemo and have a much better 2013 ;) Hang in there, girl, it gets better. Tex: what is shakin', girl?!  Thinking of you- I hope you all have a lovely day ;)",

I hope everyone is doing well!  I am as I am watching \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia!\u201d  I am also watching people burn it up on Twitter over the 121212 concert!  There a lot of very entertaining people out there! Felis: all the sniffles and the coughing were just kind of par-for-the-course when I was on chemo.  As long as you are not having fevers, that is good.  Oh yes, we all have hot flashes!   This flake pot guy tonight thought he was making me blush but of course I had to point out that mother nature was turning up my temperature!  Jerk ass!  Some guys are total flakes! Definitely keep us posted on when your surgery is.  If I understand correctly, you are going to have your last chemo next week, on the 18th, and then have surgery after that?  Just wondering if you are still going to finish chemo next week and then have surgery perhaps after the new year.  Let me know and I hope you feel better soon. Omaz: I love, love, love the remote control fans! I have 2 and even though it is going to be in the 20s here this evening, I will still be sleeping with that fan on! I find it easier to bundle  up and then kick the covers off when the flashes start then be under the covers, kicking them off and running for the back door to get some relief!  Those fans are a permanent part of my life now.  They did not go to the basement either this year as I would normally do at the end of the summer season.  No, my hot weather continues!  Ginger: thank you!  Invariably that is where they are! I am actually posting tonight largely because when I reached the landing page I saw this article: http://community.breastcancer.org/blog/what-my-patients-are-asking-can-getting-a-biopsy-spread-the-cancer/ Of course he says no, no, no about it spreading after biopsy but I really believe someday they are going to realize that biopsies do cause it to spread but what are the alternatives?  How could I have gone from 1cm on a mammogram to 2.5 cms of cancerous tumors and 3.5 cms of precancerous cells?  I don\u2019t know but I thought the article was interesting nonetheless and perhaps something you all might want to read.

Tex: the cable guy was probably riveted by what Obama was saying because he most likely rather enjoys the idea he can buy a fully loaded assault rifle in TX at the same gas station where he buys milk!  Very upsetting!  You see what is happening, right?  People are going crazy, stockpiling guns, assault weapons, Walmart is running out of stock, onliners are all but depleted of their stock and there is a massive run on gun procurement nation-wide.  Great, this is working out just great!  As a result of even talking about gun control we have caused hundreds of thousands MORE of these weapons to hit the streets!  As for crazy is as crazy does and people wanting to talk to you, I do kind of suffer from the same affliction!   A few days ago I am in a store I have easily been in hundreds of times before and never has the following happened.  On this day, while all those little kids are being laid to rest, having lost their lives at the hands of a lunatic, some woman decided to bring her \u201cmentally retarded (sorry, all-I don\u2019t know the *right* words for this type of person)\u201d son out shopping.  Well, he was about maybe in his early 30s, about 6\u20195\u201d, about 450+ lbs and he was MAD.  He got mad b/c she denied him something and he was just racing around, making a serious of odd upset-sounding noises and he would not stop.   His mother is following him saying, in some macabre voice, \u201cmommy said no!\u201d  I was a total wreck.  He was scaring the daylights out of me.  I guess I had just stopped and was getting noticeably scared.  I had no idea what he might do and the size of him, there was no way he could have been stopped if he started acting out in a physical way.  A cluster of woman stopped near me and we were all upset.  I mean we are all just coming off the biggest tragedy at the hands of a lunatic in the nation\u2019s history.  We were discussing our hasty exit strategies and then they started looking to me for what our plans were going to be to stick together and safely get out of the store.  Point is, I don\u2019t remember when or how they arrived next to me, but they did!  It was awkward as I was unofficially nominated the person who was to loosely lead the 5 of us, and 2 little kids, out of that store!  We got out, without incident, but it was scary.  I was definitely scared.  This fit of his went on for the remaining 20 minutes I was in the store and finally the store manager called the police as they were arriving as we were all leaving.  Timothea, I don\u2019t know why this happened or why people talk to me but they do.  I understand where you are at!   BTW, if you are a couponer, have you ever thought of a way to make that whole thing work better?  Not the 3 ring binder w/plastic sheets but any idea? I have often pondered how to make it all work better and those online systems and the fob on the phone/keychain do NOT work!  This is an attestment to the kind of communities we have in CT:  A few days ago I was in Stop & Shop and there was an elderly woman roaming about saying she lost her purse.  Not too many were helping her but you all, by now, know about me and my affinity for the elderly, so I offered to help her trace her steps etc.. She had been in the store, checked out, gone to her car, loaded her groceries, *went* to another store, and after going in that store and realized she had no purse, came back in search of her purse and do you know where we found it?  In the basket next to where she was parked.  Her purse was just sitting there in the basket of the cart, where she left it, in the parking lot, and before she went to another store shopping!   She was very fortunate but I also think had someone found it, they would have just turned it in to the service desk. Enjoy the spirit of the holiday, the decorations and your loved ones.  Oh yeah, and Happy End of the World Day tomorrow, as per the Mayans, just in case!!!!",

That would be an extra 2 days off really so flying is the way to go, woman!  Southwest is pretty economical. As for your niece and wanting to go tripping to NYC, I can't seem to find the map to the money tree right now!  A few summers back I was talking to my brother who said my nephew was in NY with his church group!  These kids get around is all I can say! Texas and snow?!?!?   I was stunned...even snow in Mexico?! I don't know about El Nino/Nina but all I do know is the weather on this continent has changed.",

Just watched \"Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead\" and what I found most interesting is what both fat and average size people are eating.  That guy spoke to people of all sizes who had one thing in common: they were/are on a steady diet of Coca Cola and anything fried/fast food.  It was just odd to see how some people can eat crap all day and have it not affect them outwardly and how with others, it shows in their weight.  In any case it seemed appropriate to watch it today b/c I decided today was the day to perfect the Dr. Oz \"green\" drink and also make it a few times so I get really good at it!  I really had no idea when I turned it on it was all about him fasting his way through losing 100 lbs.  It was a good movie.  I did finally perfect the Oz green drink by adding twice the amount of lime and *coconut!!*  That coconut gives it a nice kick as does a banana!  He swears by it and I have to say, it is super healthy and pretty tasty = not too shabby! Rachel: years and years ago I saw Les Miserable on Broadway.  I am just not a big musicals person. I liked \"Tony and Tina's Wedding,\" \"Wicked,\" \"Jelly's Last Jam,\" and more recently \"Billy Elliot\" but I am just not loving musicals.  I love repertory theater but I am also a little tired of seeing \"The Crucible!\"  The perennial classic, \"A Chorus Line,\" I saw when I was in high school.  I am just glad you had a nice girl's night out!  It is so healthy to do that every now and again.  My friend from Ireland was in NYC a few weeks back and he saw Les Mis and he,too, complained about the length of the film!  That was enough for me to skip seeing it in theaters!  Rach, I think everyone would be a baby relative to walking outside in 20 below weather!  I whine when it is below 30! What always amazes me is there I am with my Russian Ushanka and sure enough, some teenager walks by in cargo shorts! How is it that they can wear shorts in 20 degree weather?!   Tex: I am doing ok.  Aside from cooking all day I am also letting air get at my wounds.   I hope this helps as my surgeon is on vaca next week and I don't want to have problems. I so love the now not-so-new Rihanna song \"Stay\" but am a bit dismayed as I am sure it is an ode to that thing she is obsessed with, Chris Brown!  She is unusually talented.  Unbelievable. I blew off NYC plans tonight b/c I am just too cold! Of course from friend's apt, to cab, to restaurant, to club, to friend's apt and perhaps to train would not have to deal with the weather too much but then again, I am an excuse factory these days!!  Hoping a good weekend is your's for the enjoying!   ",

I think I am having some serious problems! They just announced on the news it was 61 here today!  All I know is the wind was whipping around and it felt way more like 40 than 60.  I was stunned and wondering if I was watching footage from a previous forecast. No, it was today.  How weird? Ginger: part of the reason I like security  cameras in my house is I can see what \"I\" am doing at night!  The last time I was engaged we were living together and he told me I would walk around at night.  I never left the house but I would wander.  I never really believed him but I find it helpful just the same to keep a \"eye\" on myself sometimes!  Don't be too hard on yourself as you may have been drowsy and those channels are designed to get us to buy stuff.  They are really good at what they do.  Walmart gets me and even though it is not a tired or drowsy issue, being wide awake makes it worse when they convince me with their clever marketing that I *need* stuff!  When i go to Walmart I have to go with a shopping list and stick to it.  It is hard and they are really good at selling us stuff, period. When I volunteered with a few people in the past, one in particular was regularly surprised when UPS truck showed up with her packages from HSN/QVC and she said she did not even remember ordering.  I just think they are really good at selling to us. Rachel: best of luck to you on your gyn/onc check-up in March.  I will be sending you positive vibes, woman!  It is so hard and can be scary.  A lot of times when we are pushed into menopause by chemo etc... our bodies still want to cycle but they can't.   I remember when I used to get my cycle I would get a pretty wicked lower back pain.  Your pain could just be from that.  I know how you feel, though, Rachel in that every pain we have to be worried about.  I try to keep myself calm but it never really works out.  I am regularly very concerned between headaches and \"itchy\" boobs and pains here and there, for me it is all cancer!  Maybe in a few more years we will be better?!  I dunno ;) Happy trails, girls! ",

It is really good.  I actually look forward to it and it is filling.  I totally understand why he has that, and just that, for breakfast.  BTW, speaking of breakfast, recently some myths were debunked and one of the main ones was if you don't eat breakfast you are going to harm weight-loss efforts and also if you lose weight \"too (whatever that is!)\" quickly it is unhealthy etc..  Glad they cleared that up! Ginger: I am so glad you saw that article.  These drugs can do crazy things and when you are tired from long-term sleep issues, anything is possible.  When my father was dying of lung cancer in the end his breathing became so labored, he was afraid to sleep.  He said there was nothing worse than not being able to sleep.   I hope you find some success with the sleep doctor.  I so wish a meditative state was easier to achieve!  Have a good weekend, girlies! Stay warm!  ",

I hope you all are doing well!  I have a few things to report.  On Twitter I was led to a report that said Japan has determined that the nuclear disaster will have zero impact on cancer rates in that area!!  Yeah, and if we were simpletons, we just might believe that!  In any case, moving right along, the local paper has given us 13 weeks free delivery.  I never get the local paper as there is hardly anything in there of interest to me.  I decided to do the daily Jumble simply b/c I am getting the paper and as I have to pay for my garbage and recycling pick-up, I may as well do something with that newspaper that I am paying to recycle.  What I noticed is how many people in the obituaries are *young* and dying of the big \u201cC.\u201d  It is scary.  Just today I was researching a judge only to find out she died of breast cancer 3 months ago.  Horrifying! This is an important word of caution to all of you who work and are looking for jobs and/or returning to the workforce: a friend who works in HR for a huge employer in NY said corporate edict now has HR reps TROLLING the breast cancer sites in an attempt to avoid making the wrong hire.  I am sorry to say but this is the greedy, colostomy-bag ridden world in which we live.  My advice to you all is to make sure you are using a screen name here, and on any other bc sites, that cannot be connected to your FB, 4 Square, Twitter and all and every other social media site you are on. I would also discourage using personal avatars and certainly avoid putting your business about your bc battle on things like FB which seems to simply be a hotbed of corporate spying.  Of course our friends in Canada don\u2019t have to worry about this b/c they have socialized med; employers here are wanting to avoid hiring anyone who has had bc b/c many health plans are privately funded meaning Anthem etc are a paper-processor for the employer and that the employer actually pays out-of-pocket for healthcare costs.  I don\u2019t care how many people hate Obama I am here to say he is going  to prove to be as pivotal a President as was FDR and Lincoln b/c he is going to make sure we get on the road to socialized medicine.  Of course our personal income tax is going to go up b/c of this but the alternative is equally unappealing fiscally.  In any case, all things to consider.  Just make sure your personal email, and that which you use for job apps and/or could be on your credit report, should not be connected with the name you use on this site.  Be careful as this country is not friendly to anyone who has cancer.  Rachel: that is so hard on your kids to be so close to your MIL and be dealing with this as they are so young.  I hope you are doing ok and your MIL is tolerating the palliative care (aka non-stop chemo) ok.  Yes, cancer is very, very hard.  I just hope you, with your personal struggles with this disease, are able to find some space and time to be good to yourself through this.  I personally think this must be pretty hard for you on some level and hope you take some time for yourself.  Be that a massage or a night out etc.. but that you just take the time for you. Iowa: apparently on days 1-5 of our menstrual cycle ER + PR levels drop and then days 6-13 the levels increase again as our ovaries gear up for ovulation.  Irregular periods mean you don\u2019t have enough estrogen.  Estrogen levels being so low opens us up for other things like heart problems, osteoporosis and even diabetes.  Bottom line, we are still alive but the affect on our bodies from that chemo is still coming to light.  You might want to go for an eye exam and *make sure* they dilate your pupils.  I will PM you more about this as I don\u2019t want to scare the rest!!!  A month  long headache is an issue and don\u2019t ignore it.  If your doctors refuse to scan you or ignore you when you say you are having headaches, go elsewhere.  I am serious as you live in that body, not them, and there is *no way* a non-whiner has suddenly turned into a whiner when you are telling them about this headache.   That headache may be just due to your body trying to wrestle out enough estrogen to get your cycle going but it also may not be. Make sure you get an eye exam and get scanned if need be.  Bottom line is something is going on and you need to find out what.  Also dealing w/1 kid screaming in Walmart caused me to leave!  I can\u2019t imagine what dealing w/5 kids is like without a headache and w/a headache, watching 5 kids would not even be on the menu!!!!! I hope your headaches have gotten better and/or you are watching less kids! Felis: having hot flashes after surgery is a very good sign!  Most estrogen production takes place in the ovaries but there is some that takes place in the liver, adrenal glands and breasts!  Hot flashes are good b/c you are presumably on tamox etc\u2026 so the hot flash is an indication that estrogen levels have dropped from whatever level they were the last time the hypothalamus checked which means tamox is doing its job and estrogen is scarce!  Good news, indeed!  I hope you are doing well these days. Tex: I hope all is well in the lone star state!!!!   Omaz: same for you in the desert!  Meant to tell you I met Gabbie Giffords at a political event recently.  What a lovely woman.  It is so hard to see her like that.  She has come a long way, though. Sptmm:  Soon you will be able to lay down some serious miles as our weather is moderating!  Hope you are doing well. The \u201cFast\u201d diet(all the rage in the UK): was watching CNN a few days back and learned of this.  Very easy and basic way of just reducing intake which is simply \u201ceat less\u201d 2 days per week.  Just 2 days per week you eat twice and for breakfast you might have a hard boiled egg, ½ apple and slice wheat toast. For dinner have 4 oz grilled chicken over 2 cups of salad.  This is less than 600 calories in a day.  Through reading about this diet I realized that there is *one* benefit to having a slow metabolism = less free radicals roaming  our bodies!!!!  I found that amazing!  People with high metabolisms also get more wrinkles and earlier in life because pace of metabolism dictates amount of free radicals!  Finally a bit of good news for those of us with the wicked slow metabolisms!  Also, by making this very manageable change for just 2 days a week you reduce caloric consumption by a decent percentage. Finally, we need a \u201cmembers-only\u201d site where bc girls can go, show their pathology to confirm that they have cancer and only then would they be allowed to post and talk to other women w/cancer candidly without the prying eyes of people who don\u2019t need to know and are just being nosy. Happy trails, girls!",

Hope everyone is well!  I totally flipped at the MRI today and just can't do the tube.  I don't know what is going on so another few days goes by now...unbelievable.  Don't know what my problem is and I feel like a big baby so much as to cause me to put off a very important test in search of one I like.  They told me today a large percentage of people have issue with the MRI tube.  What I don't understand is why no one has been able to make a more flake-friendly MRI?!  Seriously but alas I am sure the reasons are rooted in money  as is everything w/our healthcare system.   Just thinking about this now, they actually make money by keeping the tubes on the administering of sleepy med to get people through this test.  Not happy! Rachel: as an adult, I can be a jerk but as a teenager, my jerkass ways were in full-swing!  More to this point, my friend's mother, a former RN, was telling me she was recovering from a hysterectomy.  I almost died when she told me it was FOUR years ago!!!!!!!  Myself and another friend were hysterical and then, of ccourse, this was fodder for our funny machine for many moons to come! My friend's father, her husband, owned a pharmacy so these people were no strangers to all things medical.  Bottom line, and the reason I tell you this story, it takes a long, long, long time for the body to adjust after such a huge, and chemical and body-altering, surgery and I think it is different for everyone.  My hot flashes are so wicked these days, they are ripping through my body like fire.  I, too, am a little concerned but I don't think either of us accept what absolute trauma and drama our bodies have been through.  It could be even more years before your body adjusts.   Time to go make salad with wasabi almonds, my favorite!!  Night, all-     ",

Tex: As you know, I am wicked excited over your pending home purchase!!!!!!  I am so happy for you and, yes, paying a mortgage is always, always, always better than paying rent *and* often times it is less expensive.  I am so happy for you!!!  Keep us posted....I can't wait and spent a good hour sending good vibes your way last night during meditation time!  I am so excited. You must  be totally elated and don't forget, you *never* regret the things you do but regret is always about the things you did NOT do so buy the house!!! Ginger: you are absolutley correct on all counts.  I find the urban areas handle things much better than suburban areas.  Like near Yale the restaurants and bakeries do give leftovers to shelters and soup kitchens etc... but what happens in suburban areas is totally different.  I am the very last person that likes to see anything got to waste and for people to not reuse and recycle.  I cringe when I see someone throw a plastic or glass bottle in a traditional garbage can.  I think there are many, many people who try to do all they can to make things right but I think we can do better.  All in good time, I hope! Valerie Harper: this is very, very sad.  I knew earlier today when I created this post, and as per usual, I was forgetting something.  It was to post about Valerie.  It is such an awful travesty that cancer continues to march, like some behemoth monster with an insatiable appetite, across our country eating people and killing thousands every day.  The one thing I can say about Valerie is although she is within weeks (or so *they* say) of dying from this miserable disease, she looks fantastic.  I am so happy that she is such a public figure who is putting a \"realistic\" face on cancer which is we don't look sick.  I hope all the \"eye doctors\" out there who are forever remarking on how if people look good they must not have cancer take a long, hard look at Valerie.  She looks just great and I am sure she will until the day she moves on to a better place. Good day, girls!",

I hope everyone is well.  I caught some of the Piers interview with Valerie Harper in the wee hours as my hot flashes were ripping through my body like wildfire early this morning!   It was an interesting interview and what a live wire she is!  I really enjoyed it but then my eyes closed again once the fire went out!  Rachel: I know what you mean about being confused about where cancer can spread.   My BS told me that it would only like breast tissue and my onc turned and said to me \"cancer can grow into anything.\"  I know what you mean about cleaning your entire system out via surgery in an attempt to cut off it's food source (why I did the bmx right away) but then you find out it can grow back anywhere anyway.  It is both frustrating and alarming at the same time.  Currently I am being  tested for brain mets.  There is fluid building in my cranium and, to be honest, I am avoiding the MRI and I realized why : I don\u2019t want to know! Ignorance is indeed bliss!  I seriously have cancer inertia and I am tired of it all.  I don\u2019t want to lose my hair and get pumped full of poison again.  I just don\u2019t want it.  I am not interested in having my head cut open or biopsies etc\u2026  I am just not. In long, I know how you feel and I will be there for you every step of the way.  I am always sending positive vibes and will be there for you every step of the way, should there be one.   Keep us posted on  what is going on and I will be thinking of you.  I will be here physically as long as I can and when, and if, cancer relegates my carcass to the dustbin of history, I shall be hopping about in spirit!! In any case, speaking of spirits, my wonderful, wild cat was in the kitchen watching me make sauce.  At one point I turned around and addressed her directly and rather than stare at me, she is looking to my left and then to my right as if there were 3 individuals standing there.  As far as I know there was just one!  I guess the spirits are stopping by! Also every now and again she does that \u201cfox\u201d trot where she extends her neck as if she is watching someone walk away and she is curious as to where they are going!  Yeah, it is great to live like this! Keep your chin up, Rachel.  We are all walking this path together. As for the bench-clearing brawl, that is exactly what made it so funny is that it very much is not typical Canadian behavior!",

I watched it go from a few buildings to a sprawling campus that now even has a med school!  Quinnipiac has come a long, long way.  It is a becoming a bit of a Northeastern, though, in that if your parents can pay, you can go!  Plus there are so many more schools in that space are far better for the $40K+ per year they want in tuition.  You can go to Dartmouth or Cornell for that! I knew you would be doing the Revlon! I regret to inform you I will not!  I am going to some CT ACS events with a survivor friend.  There will be no running the Revlon for me this year, Deb! Ginger: I don't know if \"Netflix\" has a standard, or a regionalized, menu.  I thought of you last night as they have a PBS \"Dreams\" special.  I watched it Sunday and thought perhaps you might want to check it out.  It was informative, that is for sure. I had the strangest dream the night before and that precipitated my interest in watching.  You might want to check it out. Keep truckin, ladies!",

I hope everyone is doing well!  I was coming back from New Hampshire today and was heading through Mass when the rain got so bad I could not see anything at all.  As I was trying to pull off to the side of the road the \"emergency broadcast system\" alarm came on the radio and announced a tornado alert in Western MA and northern CT! I was a wreck! Iowa: I hope you do not have anyone affected or family in Oklahoma.  I cannot believe how horrendous that tornado was.  So awful and scary.  BTW, I looked up tornado stats and the US, no surprise, is #1 for tornadoes.  Here is the scary part: Canada is #2 at about 100 per year, second to our **1200** per year!  That is insane! BTW, I don't automatically think everyone in the Midwest is related and I know Iowa is some 8 hours from OK but you are representing on this thread for the whole of the Midwest!! Felisa: did you go to the doctor yet?! Tex: you are baaaaaaaaaack!!!!!!  I missed you!!!!  I am so glad you are back.  I hope those kids are not going to water the computer anymore! Perhaps more pets are definitely in order!  So good to hear from you!  I killed a centipede a few weeks ago and I realized human beings like to kill bugs that run fast! Normally I don't kill anything but you really can't manage a centipede!  Omaz: nice tarantulas?!  Sounds fun! Rachel: I totally forgot to tell you I dated a man from India and his cousin got married. The weddings go on for like 1 week and it was a lot of fun!  We went to 2 days of it, and though we did not stay the entire day, I got a good idea and I love, love, love Indian music!  I like club music and some of the Indian club music/techno/freestyle/rap is incendiary!   I love it!  The wedding was a lot of fun and he was a very handsome man.  Alas he was getting a little too serious for me!  I hope you had fun!  Let us know how it was.  Hope your MIL is holding steady. I don't know if it is because I have been so busy during previous times in my life or what but it seems to me that these weather cycles are coming much more severe and faster than ever.  I could be imagining things but our country has had 7 EF5/F5 hurricanes in the past 3 years.  Aside from tornadoes, the blizzard and all these other storms we have been getting.  Seems kind of crazy but like I said, it could be me and I used to be just too busy to notice.  From 96-08 there were 7-EF5/F5 but that was across a span of 12 years.  Something is going on here!  Spooky! Happy trails, ladies!",

It was a really fun day.  My best friend from like 8-14 y/o (before she got a very long-term boyfriend) lived with her single mother.  My father treated her like one of the family and my mother, although my parents were divorced by this time, did the same and when my mom took me on the weekends and we went to RI to the beaches or up to Boston or the Cape, she regularly planned to bring Alison with us.  Same with my dad.  I loved that my parents were really good to my friends! In any case, with 2 older brothers and an older sister, the classic rock roots ran deep for me and this is where my much older siblings fostered my interest in groups like Pink Floyd!  Zeppelin, The Doors, Skynyrd, Meatloaf, Deep Purple, Steve Miller and to that I tacked on Metallica, Guns, Motley Crue and Jay Z!  Yes, Jay Z!!!  I went to a number of concerts as a kid also not the least of which was Guns, Aerosmith in New Haven, NYC and Jones Beach (the best!), Van Halen (I was 15 and David Lee Roth was still w/them) but the absolute standouts were Pavarotti (MSG), Bocelli (Hartford), the Stones (Hartford) and Billy Joel and Elton John (MSG).  I had fun!!!!!! Ginger: If the squirrels were friendlier, I would make pets out of them as well as the groundhogs, chipmunks and most everything else!  I used to be crazy about spiders but now I put them outside or ignore them.  Tarantualas and snakes...wow!  THose are the 2 that I don't think I would ever have as pets and if I had to choose, I would take the Tarantuala!",

Sptmm: good to hear from you!  I am glad to hear you are doing so well and I expected nothing less!  Run the ½ marathon!  You have the rest of your life to cater to the nuances and incapacitations of crappy arthritis.  Also, if you want to run a few days a week, take an anti-inflammatory.   They help you do what you want when your joints want to give you a big \u201cno!\u201d   Of course, you can\u2019t do that all the time but it is very, very, very difficult to give up running and not to mention the highly addictive \u201crunner\u2019s high.\u201d   You are going to taper yourself and it is going to take time.  You never get the same pump or feeling of exhileration and/or sense of accomplishment that one gets from running, put power walking is a very close second, much, much better for your joints and still an excellent cardiovascular workout.   Eventually, Deb, we are all relegated to power walking!  Go to Amazon and just type in the search field \"reversing arthritis through nutrition\" or \"reversing arthritis.\" Read all the book reviews and see if there is anything there that makes sense.  Also, if you go right below the purchase area to the very small fields of \"used\" and \"new,\" buying a book for .01 and paying shipping is just fine and you get the same exact book except it is used!  It is a very inexpensive way to check out a few titles you might be interested in.  Here is a \"livestrong\" link also: http://www.livestrong.com/article/218852-arthritis-reversal-diet/ You know. last night on ABC Evening News there were warnings about consuming fruits and veg from other countries.  They said nearly 60% of our fruit comes from other countries and 20% of our vegetables.  Of course, every \"fix your body\" diet says eat as much fruits and veg as possible!  Well that is sure to open Pandora's box of other afflictions!   As for allergens and eliminating them through diet, I have a dear old friend who swears by a drink: The Dr. Jarvis honey and vinegar drink.   She swears it cures tons of allergy issues and a host of other ailments.  Apparently you have to use \u201clocal\u201d honey to get the natural immunity against pollens and allergies.  I am sure you have a place on the Island to get local honey but, if not, I will email you the place I use in Mass.  I am still doing the Dr. Oz drink every day, 8ozs.  Now I never had allergies but this year I did not even sneeze all that much during that incredibly high pollen season we had.  That Dr. Oz drink is something special!  It is a bit of a pain washing all the components each time I use the juicer but it is worth it.   If you do the Dr. Oz drink in the morning and the Jarvis drink at night, I think you might notice a big difference.    I have never heard of Dr. Hyman but if he sounds like he is making sense, listen!   As for cleanses, I did a 5 day one I purchased on Amazon.  No eating for 5 days but it does give the system a much needed rest. Well, I did not totally fast as I had my green drink each morning!  I will look up the name of it for you if you would like.   You are correct about autoimmune issues because I all but guarantee, with absolutely no cancer history in my family (sans father\u2019s lung cancer but was all but definitely caused by cigarettes), that my bc was caused by my pre-existing Hashimoto\u2019s.   All but guaranteed and there are many, many studies about thyroid issues being the culprit in development of bc.  Autoimmune health is very important. Email me if you need the info on the place in Mass to buy local honey.   Also, for some extra immunity kick, I add about 3-4 inches of ginger root to my Oz drink. Finally recently I read that people in outlying areas in China, if they suspect they have cancer, pretty much stop eating entirely.   The thinking is if you don\u2019t put anything in, cancer will not have gas for it\u2019s ruinous machine!   Clearly you can\u2019t eat \u201cnothing\u201d for too long but they go for as long as they can and then have 1 or 2 beans and start fasting again.  Cancer is very clearly the most universally terrifying thing on earth. Well, girls, our 3 year anniversary was July 10 for this thread!!   I loosely consider it August 1 as we all pretty much had gotten together by then.  What I am going to do is post all throughout the month of August positive developments in cancer research and care that have taken place in the last 3 years!  Give us all something to celebrate! My dear sisters in this battle, I am so very grateful that we are all still here.   So very grateful ;)",

CA-125 developments: they are using it to get a baseline and then to dx the super-hard-to-dx ovarine ca.  There are fluctuations in the numbers that help them dx it.  Apparently it goes un-dxd all the time b/c the symptoms can so easily be mistaken for most anything else. Wherria!!!!!!!  Holy smokes, girl!!!!!!!!!!  I can't believe you are back!!!!!!  I was absolutely enthralled to see you post today!!!!!   So excited you are doing ok and trucking along like the rest of us!  As for anniversary, I consider it the date I was dxd, when the core needle biopsy showed that there was definitely cancer in there.  That is just me, though; a lot of people use different dates.  It is just so great to hear from you!  You should see an onc just for the sake of just getting checked once in a while.  It is good but I also understand about switching oncs.  It is not easy to get established w/a new one.  As for thyroid, there are lots of connections to bc.  At least one doctor mentioned that my long battle with my thyroid may have led directly to the bc dx.  THere is a connection. Again, great to hear from you!  I hope you come back and let us all know how you are doing from time to time.

I forget the name now but I will check and post it later. In any case, as for the labeling of foods, MSG was spoken about so often in this documentary on being a culprit in cancer proliferation. MSG is often connected with Chinese fast food but it is literally everywhere. Someone said many moons ago to just shop the perimeter in grocery stores buying just whole foods if possible. They should just label the darn foods and stop killing people. I mean the argument is people will eat it anyway but the fact remains if they did not have these foods they people would not separately purchase these carcinogenics so therein lies the real issue. Another thing they talked about was root canals being tantamount to the development of bcs? I found that interesting. I am done! No, you are not grumpy! You are uncomfortable. Also, sometimes muscle relaxers take a while to kick in. I am not sure about their efficacy, however. In any case, I hope they help you! By all means, get to Seattle and go to the better place and to your family's dr. I travel to Boston to go to Dana. It is your life so it is worth it ;)",

I will give more information as I have more time. Tex: I already provided a rider on the petition to be more lenient toward women in their 20s who are finding lumps, petrified and not able to get a mammo w/out a fight. I am on the case! The \u201ccookey\u201d comments section: last night I was minding my business at the mall when someone was making small talk about bc awareness/pink ribbons stuff as I was looking at some stuff on display. Before he said something to really offend I told him I was in the club. He said \u201coh, so you found lady lumps?!?!\u201d I almost choked..... Tex!!!!!!!!! I am so glad you stopped by, girl! Good to hear from you! Your dh can bring you all kinds of flowers and get you all kinds of gifts but the best gift he gives you is those \u201cfake\u201d break-ins! You know why he does that, right? Because he is in law enforcement and he knows the number one reason people get killed w/their own guns is b/c they hesitate. It is really good that he does that. That is cool about the tattoo! Yes, perhaps getting your art back is the next, best step! I thought about getting something that alerts hospital personnel, in the event of an emergency, about bc. My medical history is so lengthy now, I just am concerned of emergency hospitalization and lack of records. This leads me to my next point: when I had my office in Stamford I was in a place where there were other companies all on 1 floor, and in 1 section, of this building. This allowed for much sharing. My neighbor, who was a muse of sorts (!), introduced me to his friend, Larry. I started to help him raise R1 funding and the product: a medical \u201cfob\u201d that one could keep on their key chain, around their neck or in the glove etc\u2026 What this thing had was all a persons\u2019 medical information on it. We all need that. The problem being is the fragmented nature of medical information and processing of that information. Someday I hope it will all be better! As for the DF study, I am not sensitive b/c I am single and battling through this disease but what I am concerned about is how many women do have additional burdens in trying not to seem sick etc\u2026 like you talked about. You try your best to put a good face on this disease for your family, which is important, but that is also a hard thing to do several days when battling this disease. That is a lot of added pressure. Also, the fact remains women are the nurturers in most families. I just thought it was cavalier to publish such a study not to mention I am still concerned about the efficacy of the data mining process. Like I said, I am on the case! I am so happy you posted! Good to hear from you! Let us know how it all goes, girl! Confession: I have hardly been able to stop singing \u201cHoly Grail\u201d for well over a month! That and the \u201cNational Anthem\u2026?\u201d Strange stuff indeed! Tex: how could you miss baseball?! I love my Yankees so and this World Series seems, preliminarily, like it is going to be a sleeper! Finally, I have never seen a \"Snoop (Dog)\" interview until he was on JKL last night! He was hysterical! Perhaps very high but wildly entertaining nonetheless! Happy trails, ladies!",

      "Content": "Jan 5, 2014 02:06PM - edited Jan 5, 2014 02:11PM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors! Ginger: you had just moved from your \"hometown,\" had been recently dx'd w/bc and found yourself in unknown parts with your dh traveling a lot w/his job so under those circumstances, anyone could become a recluse.  Honestly, if I did not have the thread of familiarity in my life, with friends who helped me through and even just going out to stores and bumping into people I know, I am not sure how I would have weathered battling bc.  It had to be pretty hard to move some 1500 miles from all that is familiar, even though you were there to be nearer your dd and dgd, it is hard to figure it all out, battle bc and put yourself back together.  In long, I think anyone who went through what you had in such a short period of time could have easily become a bit reclusive.  I think one finds comfort in getting lost in their reverie under such circumstances so although perhaps you were not out and about, traveling etc.., I am sure you were reflecting on prior travels and memories, traversing continents in the confines of your mind ;)  For this reason I would call this physically reclusive, mentally a globetrotter!  You are in an entirely new area...where is one to go when they don't know where to go?!  You will travel again and, yes, our 5 yr anniversary get-together shall be the perfect excuse to get going! Rachel: you are so smart to look at the duration of the film before going as I am just like you ---1.5 and I am ready to go!  I was getting so annoyed at the length but for those that are unfamiliar with the industry, it does take you on a ride.  If I had one criticism some parts were unnecessarily drawn out.  It reminded me of those late nights, writing papers in college and knowing that perhaps I should have omitted a few paragraphs!  It will be on Netflix in no time anyway!  As for the politicians, at least your beloved and whacky mayor seems likeable!  Never a dull moment with that one!  BTW, I love Toronto!  I think it is a beautiful city.  Tex: on that mayor, it has been reported he smokes crack and then along with that there have been several, very public gaffes!  He is very entertaining.  His purported drug addiction is not funny, of course, but his antics when he is supposedly \"not high\" are just hysterical!  He is a character all right! When I said call me and text me I meant that because we do keep in touch that way, I knew a few days before you posted here what you were going through.  I just feel so grateful you were able to get some tests done over the holidays and to get to the bottom of this.  It is scary with your eye, though.  I was talking to my onc and asking the never-ending question of how do they find mets.  She basically said eventually if cancer is growing it is going to interrupt some pertinent function ie blood flow etc.. and the domino effect will occur.   Just this morning I got an email from a very good friend in FL.  He requested that everyone pray for a cure to cancer in 2014 all on the same day.  He felt the power of prayer only do all of us good if the message was collectively sent on the same time and on the same date.  Makes sense and I am going to do it.  Let's all pray for a cure.  Cancer has reached pandemic status no matter what is being said. On Wolf of Wall St: I went where few women have ever gone before.  In fact, in the movie there is only 1 woman in production at that firm.  That is the way it was wherever I worked.   I was always the only woman. I just wanted to share with you all what my experience was and to let you know the validity of what is portrayed in the movie.  I have a unique perspective and have been approached by a few different organizations to write and basically tell my story/offer perspective.  I might do it this year but had turned down these offers in the past.  The industry now is roughly 18% female.  It was 9% female just 10 years ago.  Women are still not working at the Stratton's of the world but rather in banks and the big brokerages, doing CFP work.  I saw things I will never forget in those firms and I loved the action, the pace and the feeling of satisfaction when I left at the end of the day.  I just like to share with you all because although you may meet thousands of women in your life, it is all but guaranteed not one of them has been where I have gone.  Not one.  The lone woman at Stratton and I are some of the few who have ever seen, been able to handle it, to not be scared away and to forever thrive as a result.  She was real, btw.  There was just one woman at that firm and then I carried the torch for her to the firm I worked for which basically took over where Stratton left off. In any case, for these reasons, I share my story with you all! Happy trails, ladies and have a very nice remainder of your weekend :)",

BTW, don't get worried about sharing with us all something that is on your mind.  Seriously, you are undergoing rads on your mind---share away, please!  It is good to talk and to let out whatever is on your mind.   The last thing you need to do is be cluttering your mind right now!!  Clean house all you want, girl! Sptmm: now, take it easy, I don't want you losing more than the 1.4 lbs!!!!!!!!  Your family is way too close and might track me down in CT to castigate me for encouraging this loss!!!!  Deb, I love that you took it off and have kept it off!  I am going to write to \"Ellen\" about you!  I am also going to tell her you need a new car, a nice vacation and (I don't know if you need these but who does not!) new appliances for your whole house!!!!  Alright, slenderella, get ready to take that trip out west!!! BTW, I was in the mall the other day and my friend was trying stuff on.  A woman came out of the dressing room while I was waiting and she was all of probably 5' and was probably 80 lbs.  She was telling the very heavyset young woman that was with her that this dress, that looked like it was from the children's department, was not fitting correctly because she was not through \"shedding for the wedding!\"  As the story unfolds, her dd was getting married and she was trying to emaciate herself for the wedding.  It was all so sad, I just looked at her with pathetic eyes.  I wish I could have said something but clearly it would not have been something she wanted to hear...!!!!!!! In any case, Deb, like you have said you are running for your life.  It is a very poignant, and very true, statement.  Rather than make yourself sick to fit into some dress, you have lost weight in an attempt to save your life.  To each their own but I like your reasons much, much better ;) The very happiest of trails, ladies!",

That is so funny that your DGD is discussing a pre-opening game haircut! That is adorable! Of course you will miss her. It is so hard with parents working and raising children meanwhile battling their arch enemy, *the clock*, every single day. It is so hard and so many struggle with it and I am sure they want to see her more.  My friend was just talking about how they go from daycare to home, get dinner ready and then off before you know it bath and bedtime is there. It is so very hard on everybody. Hopefully you can see her on weekends. Just think, though, now that you know what is wrong with your back, hopefully they can help you get stronger again and then the Spring is upon us! You can do some gardening again! Also if you are feeling better, perhaps you can go to her soccer games?Things to look forward to ;) Also, the yelling, screaming, fighting in your sleep and crazy dreams are all, most likely, sponsored by melantonin. It gives people crazy, crazy dreams. I am just so glad that was not mets. Good news, Barb, good news indeed.

      "Content": "Jan 23, 2015 05:28AM - edited Jan 23, 2015 05:29AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, Warriors! I was doing some reflecting on our 5 year anniversary. This led to do some research on exactly what that means. This is some of what I discovered: >>>>\"5 years\" was borne out of a statistical reporting point, for national reporting, on survivors. >>>>These reports take place at 5, 10 and 15 year intervals. >>>>This is how they keep statistics on survivor rates. >>>>We are never \"cured\" of this disease. >>>>For bc patients, the main risk window remains until the 10 year mark. If we hit 10 years, even though we will never be considered \"cured,\" the recurrence risk drops to 1 - 2%. It is great to still be here, to be alive and for all of us to still be enjoying life. For these reasons, every year is a milestone. I don't necessarily take solace in the 5 year anniversary but in each day. The 5 year mark is nothing more than the government's way of keeping score on who is still here but I thought Edward Snowden said they are fully aware of this anyway?! I think this piece, taken from Health Central, speaks to the 5 year anniversary pretty well. The last line is the absolute take-away on this matter: http://www.healthcentral.com/breast-cancer/c/9692/... All things to consider, ladies! At the very least, we are all still here to read this ;) Wishing the happiest trails to you all!",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2015 11:29AM - edited Feb 8, 2015 11:40AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, Warriors! I diagnosed *myself* with lung mets and then when the bronchitis was ameliorated with a little Mucinex, I declared my cancer-sponsored paranoia the culprit! I go through this kind of thing so much though, and although I am never too convinced I have mets to whatever part is troubling me, it is never far from my mind! On that note, it is exhausting. Tex: I mention this b/c I absolutely LOVE the news clip, the fact you were chosen for that program, the fact you look so fantastic and full of life and also, through teary eyes, you mention how much cancer takes from us not the least of which is peace of mind, the thought you are going to live for a while longer. Just this past week, I was with an old friend and through that conversation I did realize I have been slowly, and quietly, preparing to depart this life way sooner than I thought I would. Eighties in my sleep, that is how I saw myself \"going\" but I think, for most of us, that is the ideal departure! In any event, Timothea, cancer did indeed take my peace of mind! It is alarming, in fact. You look so great and your hair looks fantastic after just 1 year! That is great growth you have there! You look really good and, as per usual, you put the BEST face on cancer ever! You know how many people you have touched with your very essence through this board and in other ways, and now through the news to people in San Antonio? Do you realize you probably made most every person that watched you both laugh and cry, in just a few minutes? I am just really happy to know you. You are one of the finest people whose acquaintance I have made in quite some time. So many people are so awful and ugly, mired in justification of their dastardly actions, and here we are all just trying to survive and make this all right in some way. You, Timothea, epitomize \"making this right\" and I thank you so much for that! Much love, woman :) One more thing: this young woman at a convenience store, I had gotten friendly with her from going in, asked me once about bc and was wondering, after learning what I had been through, if I had a mets-sponsored hysterectomy, would I even be considered a woman anymore?! I am not joking and she was not speaking with malice but rather was just a young woman trying to figure this all out. She raised a good question but then we all get back to what is \"being a woman\" to each one of us and, quite frankly, I never really thought much about my equipment in that vain! It was an interesting exchange and does speak to your point about what cancer takes from you. I hope that young woman never gets bc and has to go through worrying herself, most likely sick, about mets and the eventual annihilation of her gender-identity. Enough said about all that cancer can, threatens to, and will take from us, depending on when we let it. On that note, I must say, the women in this group are made of some special sauce!! Speaking of said \"special sauce,\" Timothea, you must watch the Super Bowl!!! I know you recorded it so get to watching! It was the SUPEREST BOWL ever!!!!! Amazing game, the catch-of-the-year followed by the catch-of-the-year!!!!!! Good times....and now that I think of it, maybe that is where my fake lung mets came from, all my Super Bowl howling!!!! I watched a PBS show on bc recently and they are still going on about how bc is affecting women with age, like around 70 their risk factor goes up. All I could think is the median age in this group was probably early 40s. I don't know where they get their numbers or if new trends have not caught up. The latter is probably the case. At least they are always talking about bc, though, that is for sure! In this we must take some solace. Good day to you all and hope you all have a nice Valentine's Day!",

I learned this evening she died on December 5th. I had gotten close with her, off the boards. We had similar dxs, and subsequent surgeries and had just gotten close through our shared experiences. I knew that she had been dxd with spine mets. It was heartbreaking but I guess I just really thought she would be ok and that the mets would be treated. My heart is very heavy. I liked her so much and although recently she had been less communicative, and unfortunately I did suspect things had taken a turn for the worse, I really hoped she would be ok. Adey's husband was wonderful and very supportive, she always spoke very highly of him. I think they had a great, great love. She also has 2 daughters, both in college. I remember her talking to me about what would come of her daughters if she passed while they were still young, feeling in some way she was leaving them and she lamented the thought this disease was going to take her away from them. She spent a lot of time in her final years enjoying her family, taking vacations, and making memories. This disease is so heartbreaking. Godspeed, Adrienne.",

      "Content": "Apr 5, 2015 09:41AM - edited Apr 5, 2015 10:00AM by 1WonderWoman Good morning, Warriors! Saw this news story this morning and I wanted to share: http://trove.com/a/Could-This-Combo-Therapy-One-Da... The most important thing I read was about cancer's (diabolical) interest in sugar, to the exclusion of everything, in its desire to grow, as follows: USC researchers focused on the fact that cancer cells are far less flexible than healthy cells in their need for glucose to survive and keep growing. Cancer cells by nature are dividing faster than traditional healthy cells, so they require more glucose than normal cells. By cyclically fasting during a treatment course of a lower-toxicity class of drugs, a patient could reduce their glucose intake and dramatically slow the rate of cancer cell division. Furthermore, reducing glucose intake through fasting could cause cancer cells to utilize their kinase pathway -- sort of an energy reserve pathway for cancer cells -- to survive and multiply. But pharmaceutical companies have created drugs specializing in inhibiting kinase, removing the other pathway by which cancer cells get fuel to survive. I have not discussed this here but I actually do protein drink fasts 2 days a week. I use a protein powder, cold coffee (add morning leftovers to a container in the fridge), a few drops of vanilla extract, ice, water and a little almond milk. Not only does it taste like a drink we are being charged $6 for at Starbucks, it is also a nice way to give your body a break. Sptmm: I have decided your new moniker is \"wonder woman!\" In that last photo, you really do look like wonder woman!! Body butter: I was telling my sister a few nights ago how much I do not love moisturizing my body with olive oil and how everything else contains too many items that end in -ium, -ate etc.... for me to feel comfortable using. I am working on some lotions made of 100% pure and natural items. As soon as I feel I have perfected the product, I am going to put the \"recipe (including ratios)\" here for you all to enjoy! Make your own body butter, save your skin, avoid more cancer and feel better about preserving something natural with something natural!  Happy Easter to some and Happy Passover to others! Hope you have a nice day!",

I decided to change my screen name largely b/c the old one was connected to an email address. Sure enough, I met someone from high school and gave them that email to keep in touch. Well, they Googled it and found all of my posts on this thread, and then got upset that I did not tell them that I have cancer, as we were simply catching up in the middle of the mall. I was so pissed off, I cannot tell you. First, this is a private matter; second, what are you doing Googling my information? So now I am \"1wonderwoman,\" which is kind of the way I feel sometimes anyway. So now you know! At least going forward this name will not be connected with that email. Is anyone sick and tired of the technological web in which we live?! Tex: where are you? I have called and texted, and now I am posting. Please update? I know we are all sick with this awful disease, but that does not mean because we are all at different points with this albatross, that we don't want to be kept apprised of what is going on as we wind our way through this mess. Please update. Cure: I was in NY on the train recently, just left Grand Central, and sure enough some flake finds their way to me. They were going on all about breast cancer, and how there is a cure etc.... I never once told them they were staring in the face of someone who was definitely not cured, and that there is no effing cure for this, alas I just listened, hoping they were getting off at 125! Fate would have it, we were both getting off at the same stop. It was a long ride, but what was really confounding is where are they getting this stuff from? Felisa!!!!!!!!! I am so very happy to hear from you!!!!!!!!! I got so nervous since the last time you, and Whitney, stopped by and made a post, the situation seemed as if it could be a bit ominous, and then you disappeared! Sadly, we are part of a very terminal club, and the members in our club are taken down by our common disease. For this reason, please, please, I implore you, update once in a while. Just even twice a year to just say hi, I am still here! I know that sounds cavalier, and a bit silly, but I got to know you through this thread, and I worry about all of us, even though I know what our fate is. In any case, I diagnose myself with mets 2 or 3 times a week, on average, and by this I mean every lump or weird feeling I think is cancer. Likely lately I had weird feelings in my back, like rolling weird feelings traveling up my back. It is weird, and the reason I share is because we are always scared going forward. I mean you never \"unhave\" cancer. Once you have it, you will until you cease to exist. I mention all of this because the lumps are scary to every one of us. My question to you, which my surgeon asked me recently, is does it move? If the lump moves, or feels in any way soft, it is likely innocuous. If, however, it is not moving, perhaps you should have it checked out. Aside from that, even if it is a tumor, don't forget even people with cancer can have benign tumors. Don't fret, and I want you to PROMISE to keep me posted! I am so glad to hear from you! Happy trails and happy holidays, ladies, and may the force be with you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

And a GREAT, BIG hello to Wherria and LadyinBama!!!   I am so glad that you guys have posted---and quite recently!!   I am officially 1/2 an RN!   I am well on my way to helping all the others with all kinds of cancer, and as you all might suspect, I am particularly enthralled about helping our sisters in the fight.   I sooo look forward to telling them my story, especially that by the time I graduate and pass the NCLEX, I will be also celebrating my 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY!!  It took me over a year in the program, to admit to my wonderful advisor and another member of the faculty, whom I really respect and appreciate, that I indeed have breast cancer.  The faculty now largely are \"in the know,\" yet very few of my classmates know. The reason being is although the median age in the program is likely 39ish, I am very friendly with a lot of the under 30 crowd.  People have told me I put a great face on this disease, a story of being triumphant against a lot of odds, yet I don't want to scare the younger women in my group.  Before graduation, I plan to be more open about it, but for now, it is still my secret for the most part.  How do you guys deal with disseminating what I now consider to be fairly private information? I would be interested to hear your feedback.  I give this website information out to people on occasion, when I meet someone in the struggle whom I deem might be helped by following our stories.  I hope that this thread brings great joy and encouragement to many, many people in this fight. I really want more people to come back and post, telling their stories, and giving updates.  Ten years is a long time, and from everything they tell us, we have nothing but good things to expect after that momentous anniversary. I would so love to hear from everyone and I would absolutely welcome the idea of planning a 10 year anniversary celebration, perhaps in Vegas, or some other spot we could all agree on.  I mean, after 10 years, we all totally deserve a great, big, fun celebration!    Happy trails to all of you and many, many thanks for all the support you all gave to each and everyone one of us as we all engaged in a valiant fight for our lives--I think of you often :) Signed, Your Fearless Leader (yea, right!)    ",

      "Content": "Jul 29, 2010 03:46PM - edited Jul 29, 2010 03:49PM by 1WonderWoman Hello all Just so everyone knows, I will do weekend updates on our list. Again, any ideas on how to better structure the list are welcome. I think it is proper and fitting that each person be recognized and appreciated for not only their start dates but their duration of treatment and type of treatment as well. I hope you all are happy with the format. Lisa: no problem on putting the list together and best of luck on your August 2 start date. The list is designed so we can all send positive vibes your way on each date. I will be thinking of you on August 2. Rachel: I am going to add you to the \u2018type confirmed but date unsure' this weekend. I wish you did not have to join us but I sure am glad to have you! You can stick with us right through as even me, when I actually start chemo, I am going to be going for 12 weeks so I will be lurking around this thread for a while as will many of us. StCards: when I first your ice recommendation I thought it was worded as if I might lose my TOES!!!!!! I had to read it 3x's to realize you meant nails! Thanks, as always, for your contributions to our thread as we sure need all the help we can get!!!! Joking girls...we will be fine! I am your fearless leader....!!!! Michelle: thanks for your information on your first treatment and how things are progressing for you. Also the stool softener idea...easy to forget unless we have thoughtful posters reminding us ;) I am glad day 6 is getting better for you and, as for your hair, when/if it does come out, 5 weeks after it is over you will start to get a decent amount back. I am pretty sure I am just going to do bald because of the summer heat, or head scarves, and you never know: you might like it bald for a while! Like I said before, this is the only time in our lives (hopefully!!) we will ever be able to see ourselves bald and to experiment with different options! Have fun with it! Jet: I am going to miss your crazy avatar but I wish you well! Thanks for stopping by and happy trails! Donna Kay: don't delete!!!!! Stay here and speak your mind...even if you are not on chemo! Lisa: your short hair looks really good. Very nice cut. Wherria: Welcome! I must say our dx's are very much simpatico...same dx, same sneaky/evil cancer, same \"why did this person get this,\" and you are a IIa and I am Iib. Our differences are negligible and the anomalous natures of both our cancers are quite similar. I love your avatar...looks like you prepared your fur already! It looks good. I was stunned when I read your post as our entire experience is nearly parallel. In fact, we were dx'd only 5 days apart. I am also TC x4 but don't have a start date b/c getting over infection I caused by helping someone else and causing my drain to have to be pulled prematurely as it was ejecting itself from my body and the pooled fluid got infected. Our only other difference is I went straight bmx right away; no lump or mx...I don't have much luck and was too afraid to hold onto the other one! Most importantly don't apologize for length ever. Discuss, write, let it out...that is what we are all about. Welcome- Calamtykel: Welcome! Our dx's are exactly the same except your tumor was about 150% smaller!! Mine, however, is a little on the sneaky side! I would not hesitate to drive to the chief of onc at the hospital in NJ for treatment even if the locals are on board with their treatment plan. The difference with him/her is that if you have to change/need a new type/something needs to be tweaked, that is when you want to be at the big hospital. Something to consider and thank you so much for joining us. We will all pretty much be together on this thread until Halloween! Deb J: Welcome and thanks for joining us! A mom, wife and grandmother is why you get tired! Joking...honestly, I was bmx'd with immediate recon on June 22 and my energy peaks and falls hard daily, still. I guess it is going to take time. I am not really paying attention to it b/c with chemo starting shortly, I feel my energy might not be all that great for a while so we just keep marching toward the future and, as they say, today is a present and tomorrow is a gift so keep smiling! Lisa: you make a very good point about how everything on this journey has been far better than the crippling anticipation of events yet to come. Don't fret...we are all in this together. At least you have an onc/chemo staff that is setting up appointments for you and taking care of what you need. I, however, have been submitted to a non-Yale, unprofessional circus where no one follows up or makes appointments. Alas I will deal with that this week as I am over the infection that stalled the chemo pursuit. (wife of) Sundiego: Welcome and I will add you this weekend! We are going to make this experience as pleasant as possible for all. Nice to have you with us. Huntreiter: Another August girl! Happy to have you join us. I will update the list this weekend. As for the hair, they say not everyone loses hair, but the preponderance do, and it usually starts to go shortly before or after the 2nd treatment. I am going to wait for it to start going and then I have an electric razor and I am going to have a friend buzz cut me. If I actually do a full shave, I am going to go to a barber especially as we will be in a sensitive position relative to cuts. I would stick with the comfort of your own home...you know how weepy everyone gets over bc!!! I would NOT want to be sitting in a salon! Rachel makes a very good point in that in 1 year we WILL be looking back on these ridiculous choices we are being forced to make and laugh! And if I have my way we are going to laugh our way right through chemo!!!!!!! DebJ: the best prep you can do for chemo is mindset and everything else will be fine. Millions of people have gone through this and are walking amongst us talking, laughing, living and loving. This is only as big a deal as you allow your mind to make it. The only thing we can control is our reaction to the event because we have no control over what has happened. On that note let's all take control of our response to the situation and, like that old 80's song goes, \"don't worry, be happy!\" The last time someone told me worrying was going to make a matter better was never so throw that tool away. It has no place in this space!!!!!! What a journey we our collectively embarking on and we have only just begun. Let's roll!",

Calamtykel- You are absolutely correct in that they have come a long way on treatment and conquering this disease.  Even my father, who died in 1999 of lung cancer, went through a much different process than I am experiencing.  I think when the cause is actually found it is going to be something simple because cancer is too ubiquitous to not be systemic.   Just my thoughts!  In any case, glad this is 2010 b/c cancer treatment and understanding gets better every year it seems. Sohard- by the time we are done I want you to change your screenname to \"neverbeensoez!\" Zenith- come out, come out wherever you are!  Did you make your list of questions?  I am concerned about you! To all: I did some work on the \"list\" and I removed the \"type\" of chemo each person is having.  If you all want it listed, what I can do is compile a list and at the end of the month, after we all (mostly) have started so we can keep track of that as well.   I am going to welcome your feedback. Please, all,  welcome Texas Rose!  I will be posting a weekly update tomorrow evening to, within the flow of our thread, make everyone aware of who is starting to get healthier in the coming week as they embark on the next leg of this journey to take care of themselves.

First, I am not a doctor.  Second, the most important thing you can ever do is exercise.  Third, exercise as much as you can on chemo but the trick is learning what you can and cannot do. Chemo is in our blood, circulating at our resting heart rate speed.   When you increase your heart rate, you increase blood flow to all parts of the body but now our blood is carrying something our bodies are not used to digesting so we have to go slower than usual to gradually introduce our blood with our new friend chemo in it to other parts of the body until they adjust.  The following is a reminder of what happens when we exercise and blood does get to our stomach pretty quickly as we do increase our heart rate, as follows: The Cardiovascular System and Exercise  The cardiovascular system serves five important functions (1) during exercise: 1) Delivers oxygen to working muscles 2) Oxygenates blood by returning it to the lungs 3) Transports heat (a by-product of activity) from the core to the skin 4) Delivers nutrients and fuel to active tissues 5) Transports hormones Exercise places an increased demand on the cardiovascular system. Oxygen demand by the muscles increases sharply. Metabolic processes speed up and more waste is created. More nutrients are used and body temperature rises. To perform as efficiently as possible the cardiovascular system must regulate these changes and meet the bodys increasing demands (2). I hope this helps.   Just go a little slower and also, don't forget, if you are walking or running in the summer heat, cardiac drift is an issue.   This occurs during prolonged, steady-state exercise, in a hot climate as a steady state heart rate will gradually increase, when normally it should not, and this phenomenon is regarded as occuring in response to your rising body temperature.  Bottom line, definitely exercise but pace yourself a bit more while your on chemo.  Sorry, guys...I feel badly that my remarks had all of us exercisers in a panic!

It has been over a year since I received the call You have breast cancer...I remember starting to bawl. Surgery was needed, chemo and rads, too. Don't forget the IV med, Herceptin, which is new! My journey is written but I don't know the end.... But do any of us really, my friend?? I have written each chapter in my heart and my head, From every tear to hope to all of the meds. My surgery has temporaily changed me frm a C to an A Thank goodness for pump ups in this modern day! I made it thru surgery, waking up w/4 drains. Taking my Vicodin to get thru the pains. I heal and get stronger each and everyday So, I finish that chapter w/success, I say! A new chapter starts, the one we all dread... Chemo begins and I know it will affect my head. Soon, my brush was filled w/chunks of hair I was sad, but I was prepared to look in the mirror. Fun wigs..short wigs...sassy ones, too! No one knew which one I would do! Made it through chemo w/support of family and friends Time to close that chapter, thought it would never end! So, the new chapter begins of radiation for over 6 weeks The burn and the pain would eventually peak Again, I make it thru w/everyone's love and prayers. Each day, I live in Faith and Hope, NOT fears. I close the chapter of my new burnt skin. Grateful my expanders did not give in! I do my IV med, Herceptin, every 3 weeks for a year. The Oncologists staff know you by name and truly care The access was made easier by inserting a port But it's been over a year, not very short! So, when does this chapter get to close for me? In 2 weeks, and my heart needed these words to be free You won't hear this often, but it gets stuck in our mind. We get fearful, as safety nets are removed one at a time. This is where I learned to control what I think Positive thoughts can turn a black world to pink! I also have learned to not live in fear, but hope It is love, faith and believing that helps us cope. So, here I sit two weeks before my final surgery day Looking forward to silicone, port out and an overnite stay I felt the need to write down my words for others to hear. Maybe you will read them and want to share I am a fighter, a warrior at war. I have my battle wounds to even the score I wear my pink boxing gloves and continue to fight. So, pray for all of us each day and each night!!",

Omaz: enjoy yourself in that pool!  I am so proud of you for keeping up with your cording exercises and in noticing a difference!   That is such good news.  You really don't have to be cording...just keep, albeit moderately, stretching it out.  It must feel great to get back in the pool after being out almost a year.  Good times, woman!  The latest person I nominate to be on the cruise with Texas toast: SWEENEY!   I know she says she went back to work but we have not heard from her in weeks....very suspicious!",

I drink only water, seltzer (non-flavored etc..), green tea and milk. I am constantly drinking water now and keep a bottle by my bedside. This cotton mouth is very uncomfortable...reminds me of college when my 2 pot-smoking roommates would cause me to get contact high AND the very awful cotton mouth! In any case, forgot to ask you about the circus? Was it fun?! Sorry about your son's team losing. Soccer, however, is a great sport. Lacrosse is difficult. I was telling my brother the other day, who played hockey from peewee right through high school, that I never realized how much talent it takes to play hockey and what a tough sport it is, IMO, and lacrosse is second relative to skill. I was just watching a hockey game on ESPN and it dawned on me how much skill is necessary to play that game. Deb- it is true...snow overnight :( I totally forgot to tell you guys about my uncomfortable experience with 2 a-holes (remember I live in Connecticut!) last night! I went out with a baseball cap on and a Baby Phat coat I purchased online, by accident, and it would have cost me too much to return! In any case, it has one of those detach hoods with the fake fur around it and for that reason I thought it would be hide the back of my head and I could wear a baseball cap. Well, these 2 pretentious jokers, in their 40's, must have been liquored up. They were sort of next to me as I was waiting in line at a Mobil station. The guy kept looking at me out of the corner of his eye (I have good peripheral) as I guess he was trying to figure out what was off about me.  Of course, someone had to be playing a butt load of lotto to make matters worse.  Finally I just took the damn hat off! The woman said \"is that the latest fashion?!!!\"....not joking! To which I replied \"no, but you must be the latest brand of a$$hole!\" She was apologetic both for her quaffing and for making fun of my lack of a natural coif!  Unbelievable. My lack of hair is of zero concern to me but I guess, for some reason, people must really let their appearance be what defines them.  It is really weird how attached they are to their hair and can't believe that someone else would be ok without it, albeit temporarily.   My only problem with it is I get cold and I don't like people staring...obviously! ",

They are so punted around our system. I have volunteered over the years and would very much like to be an advocate for those who's voices are squashed as they get on in years. In any case, thanks for your well wishes. I appreciate it. Are any of our bmx/mx folks having complete feeling under their arms, back of the arm etc...? I never lost feeling and, more to this point, I had a very talented surgeon. In any case, now with this wound packing, there is one point when I am packing that I feel like I am touching my lymph track or something.

You can tell I am into telecom....I totally forget to remind you to do the most basic thing....pop the battery, wait 15 seconds and put it back in.   That should do it.  If you have not popped the battery, that is exactly why your phone is not working. If you are with one of the major carriers you can invariably request an online chat with customer service if you need help. Let me know if you need anything else ...I would send you my # but what good is that?!  I hope this helps-",

Not only all the bc stuff and family and loss but you were also home schooling 4 kids at the same time! I do suspect you change in a phone booth! I bet your hair does look great. You seem to be naturally blonde and you have straight hair it seems so that is always looks great short, long etc... I bet it looks really good. Kale and swiss chard...good for you! Good for us, actually...we all need to be doing that. I would have a small garden but I do have woodchucks and moles out here. My neighbor and I actually have an issue because he has a huge garden that he refuses to rabbit fence in and the moles, woodchucks and the like are eating at his place all summer! He actually asked \"ME\" if it was ok for him to SHOOT the animals because they like to tunnel at the perimeter of my yard. I don't have to tell you all how that conversation ended!!!!!!!! That is great that you have homes lined up for the kittens. I wound up with my cat, aka THUG, by adopting her from her life along the highway where someone dumped her so I am all about being responsible with kittens. The other day I was petting her and giving her kitty love while she sat on her windowsill perch and as I was doing this, she slowly turned her head to glance out the window. All I could think was she was hoping the other animals did not see her as I might ruin her street cred!!!!!!! Texas: 7/22/10...your cancerversary is coming up also. I can understand why the docs had so much trouble believing you had it. I am just happy they found it and we are all getting treatment. You have goats?! You will not believe this but only in Connecticut! There is a somewhat posh suburb of New Haven where a man I knew lived with his family. His wife had goats and she would tell me how she spoke to them etc... In any case, what a ruckus ensued...the neighbors went to the town, fought it out and forced her to get rid of her goats. She cried for weeks. I felt so bad for you. Mind you, acreage is not plentiful in places like Connecticut and to have 3 acres for a home is fairly palatial as things go. They had 5 acres and STILL had to get rid of their goats. So sad! I do have dreams where my hair is long. All the time. I never dream of me with short hair and I am still a bit surprised when I catch a glimpse of myself! What does work out for me is I have been wearing baseball caps for 20 years in my downtime meaning to the gym, grocery store etc.... and especially in the summer when I like to drive with the windows down and not have to choke on hairballs! When I see me with the baseball caps, I am ok with what I see. When I see me with it off, it is weird. Ginger: I have curly hair also and have spent much of my life straight ironing! That is one thing you might try, if it is maybe 1\" or longer just to get it under some semblance of control for a while. Yes, I am also with you on face hair: I actually have to have my first waxing in 9 months this week. I so hoped the upper lip hair would not come back!!!!! Iowa: I am so sorry about your cat. My cat of 18 years died a few years back. I was so brokenhearted. I am so sorry for your loss. They are like part of the family. I still think of her and she was trained in Japanese only! I spoke to her always in Japanese! I am hopeful that, if there is an afterlife for cats, she will be an ambassador for some country to Japan!!!! I still miss her today. She was long-haired calico..she was so pretty! I am sorry you had to have this happen. Off to make copies of tax junk. Enjoy your Sunday, girls! PS- I volunteered with the elderly for years and would actually like to get into elder care management which is why I am going back to school for nursing. IN any case, I used to visit a few women in a nursing home and would say \"hi girls\" when I arrived and finally, this one day, one of them said in a pretty upset tone \"we are NOT girls and stop calling us that!!!!!!!!\" I will never forget it! Ihope you all don't feel the same way about me calling you girls! I think it is complimentary actually but I could be wrong...as I have been in the past!",

At the very least, we can all be thankful that better weather is upon us, albeit in the form of warmer temps and rain! Where is Zenith?! I just realized we have not heard from her in a while. Although she was going back to work around this timeframe. Well, Zenith, if you are reading, I miss you! Sptmm: I am so with you on the mental thing. Even with crosswords and flashcards and studying, am still having wicked weird dreams and I don't seem back to normal yet at all. I keep having dreams of my father, who has been dead for 11 years, and he is alive and these dreams have been going on for a bit now. I am also having dreams about people I have not seen in years. Who knows?! Leftover chemo blessing perhaps!! Calamtykel: who the heck is your SIL to establish your husband's \"duty\" list?! My concern would also be the affect of setting such unrealistic expectations of a husband's place upon my DD. I think if I were married I would have preferred my husband work as well especially in these precarious economic times and the fact that we are all so in desperate need of health insurance that the working party cannot afford to be cavalier. People who don't have cancer are clueless as to how many things we have to consider. Kel-I love broccoli rabe!!!! Love it! You must tell me how that comes out! Swiss Chard is an acquired taste, much like Kale, but in our state of health, we better get acquiring!!! That is my motto because I was never a friend of kale or swiss chard pre-bc! Did your mom get her dog yet? Ckptry: you know what I remember most about from childhood? I thought I was some sort of astronomer so my mom would sit by the pool with me at night in the summer and I had my wicked sophisticated Fisher Price astronomical gadgets (!) and I would look at the stars and she would talk to me about life, love and the pursuit of happiness! We would also sing \"Frere Jacques\" and other childhood songs. I also remember going to the beach a lot with her as we lived in a shorefront town. She was sick at that time also, SICK of my father that is, and would soon be leaving(!!!) but those were my fondest memories so popcorn in bed will definitely stand out with them. Those are the things they remember. Of course I remember the amusement parks and all but not like those summer nights in the backyard singing and me looking at the stars. I also LOVED trips to the book store to get \"Nancy Drew\" books! \"The Hardy Boys\" too!  BTW, those summer nights were a way for me to also bend my mother's ear about how my brothers were mistreating me!!!  Riding me in the pool like Seabiscuit for one!!!!!  Yes, I was the youngest and enjoyed every minute of telling mom and dad of my mistreatment when they were not around!  Ginger: glad you got out to dinner and had a good time. It must be hard with your DH traveling. That must be hard on you. I love Mexican and, of course, margaritas! I also love \"andale\" which is a Mexican Dance. In fact they do it in Zumba! JSW: congrats on being halfway and for the crying jag over more painting to be done! You have been working non-stop in that house through rads, from what I can gather, and it is a lot. Cry, breakdown, ease the pain, woman!!!!! Let it all out! Well, my new flip-out is the CT Scan dye for the brain scan! I am busy googling all kinds of mayhem that the dye will lead to and low and behold, what do I stumble on? More research which has been done regarding CT Scans and the potential for them to definitely be cancer-causing!! Just great! Best news! I am backing off Google until it is done!! I hope the people in my crazy dreams do not turn the color of the dye! I will then be getting much less sleep than I already am!!!! Good day, all-",

Ckptry: where are you?  How are you?  I hope things are getting better. Rachel: ROCKIN' THE 5KM!!!!!!!!!  WHOO HOO!   Good for you.   Man, I am still struggling to get a decent pace going on that treadmill but practice makes perfect ;)  You will do it and you will do it well.  Perhaps you are going to come in first...we never know!  Sptmm: no snow!!!!!!!  YAY!  So glad we dodged that one.  I think it might be safe to say Spring is officially here!  Did you get the results of your scans? One habit I got into: I have a pc of fruit and a cup of green tea when I do the crossword.  It is a great combination! Good day, all-",

Mets) in a few weeks and will take some pics of ARod or Jeter if you would like!!!!!!!    I have pretty good seats so that should be an easy one!   9/11 sucked.  That is all there is to it.   So very sad and devastating.  You never hear me squawking at the airport because I am only way too familiar with why all that is being done.   I will never complain of the extra few hours I have to plan for when I fly as I know it is for my own good. I am just glad he is gone even though cutting the head off the snake will spawn more aggravation for us, no doubt. I felt relieved so much after I heard the news that I realized I was still carrying it with me.  That really struck me.   I was devastated for months after that.  What was worse is we had a pretty healthy \"happy hour\" that was normally midtown because I had friends in advertising etc.. and Bull and Bear is there.  In any case, every now and again I would say to my friend Mike \"where is so and so\" and he would give me that look and slowly break it to me they were gone.  After that happened a number of times I just did not go to happy hour much for a while.  I was tired of finding out that yet another person I knew was dead.  I remember being in WTC in my boss's office one night and we were looking out at the water.  I told him, as we both sat staring, we had made it.  We were there, in the most robust financial market in the world and in the most revered towers of capitalistic intention ever built.  It was a night I will never forget and nothing will ever compare.  Those buildings were beacons of hope and I am happy they are being erected again.  I know every person who died in those buildings and was a part of the fabric that made up the financial industry would want that without a doubt.  ",

That is a shame. I don't know what to make of these dizzy spells either and I certainly drink plenty of water so I shall just wait and see. Perhaps I really should not pay much attn to any of this until I am 4-6 months post-chemo. Kel: biting your neck might have been faster and less painful! BTW, of course the band was slowing it down! I had an inept phlebotomist once when I was like 18...left a huge bruise like the size of a baseball on my arm. Texas: tamox does cause headaches. You should call the onc just to let them know you are getting the headaches and try to keep track of the time of day/night you are getting them and if the Tylenol or Advil is helping. Keep a journal as you onc should want to know these things.

Geez, I am really glad your dd is ok and that you did not get really hurt. As for my headaches and dizziness, the dizziness could be because I am getting up too quickly but since when does getting up fast at 41 make you ready to faint?! The headaches could be ocular as I just started reading again and am on \"Team of Rivals\" as well as Joe Torre's book and \"Straight from the Gut\" also. In any case, I am hoping it all adds up to nothing much...that would be nice! Make sure you get those fire alarms straightened out and pick up a CO2 monitor while you are at it! Chelsea Lately: I think I have told you all how much I love her show! In any case, she was talking about liking to drink and how at one point she ate very sparingly to accommodate her drinking (not joking!) and so she brought on her personal trainer and he wrote a book. He really got her to the point where she could still enjoy her Belvedere and eat correctly. In any case, she said her body is in better shape than ever and swears by this trainer. The one thing I love about Chelsea is she REFUSES to arbitrarily plug products so when she makes a reco it is based on empirical data and not lining her pockets! The book is \"Body Confidence\" by Mark Macdonald. It sounds like he is on to something....I mean just look at Chelsea! JSW: good luck with getting the house on the market. It is kind of fun getting it to \"model home\" status, however! A lot of work also. As for the rads and your pink skin, perhaps the tech has pink eyes!!!!!!!! Maybe they see everything in pink! I went to the PT: very nice, said I probably do have tennis elbow and all the other aches, and neck pain, we will work on.  He gave me some helpful tips on some stretches I can do daily. He was very nice and very helpful. I will probably head back to him in a month or so and what a nice guy he is. I went to the PS: We are going to get TE reinsertion plans going soon...YAY!!!! I can't wait to get this show on the road! Anyone do yoga? I am having such wrist pains post-chemo when attempting down dog. I know it is probably just going to take some getting used to again but also wondering if anyone else is having this type of problem. Hair: so glad it is coming back in! It is actually getting long enough so that it no longer stands up when I get out of the shower and it is actually flat against my skull when it is wet now....big developments!",

A cancer drug received FDA approval today.   It is one that deals with a rare thyroid cancer.   At least something got approved. As we are on the precipice of a partial govt shut-down, the talk of medicare, and on the state level medicaid, costs has come up a number of times.  Well if someone could please find a cure for some of these super expensive diseases getting treated, present company included, our medicare would not be so high.  One of my hopes is that I do live to see the cure of at least one type of cancer.   That, in and of itself, would be a huge step toward curing others.   Have a nice weekend, women-",

      "Content": "Apr 11, 2011 03:23PM - edited Apr 11, 2011 03:30PM by 1WonderWoman Good day chemosabes and radicals- The port is out!!! YAY! The area hurts, though. She was really digging in there to get it out and then when she was done I asked her if she got the catheter as well and she said yes and how that is what they worry about when taking them out. Apparently it is quite common for a piece to snap off.  I caught a glimpse of the surgical dressings and I cannot believe how much blood there was....it is surprsing.  Then when they took the IV out the nurse remarked that I was a \"bleeder.\"  I responded with no, I have never been such in my life.  I wonder if my blood has gotten watery?! So there I am in recovery and I told the nurse the vein where the catheter ran through still feels hard and she pressed on it, nearly putting her fingers through my collarbone (!), and said it must be scar tissue....I sure hope so. The area is far more tender than it was when I had it put in. Oh well...at least it is out! Did anyone else still have that hard feeling in their vein after having the port removed?   JSW: it seems like rads is not slowing you down at all! Good for you. I hope you get in some knitting and tv watching soon!  Also, on clutter, my stepmother was a clutter fiend and I think, for that reason, I am very no-clutter as was my father and my mother.   The step thing was a part of my life, regretably, from 9 yrs old to 18 yrs old....oh how I wish that was not the case!   Ckptry: I will be happy to send my brother over and your house will be decluttered within a few hours!!!! He is \"Mr. Toss It!\" I am constantly donating extra stuff to Goodwill and we have a place here that is a \"free\" store so the people don't have to pay for things they need. That is one way I get rid of clutter. I do a lot of recycling also. More about my brother, however, as you all know my BIL passed recently and my brother was busy telling my sister how to get rid of everything to consolidate etc.... !!! Needless to say, she was not happy about this advice! He is a tosser, however! Sptmm: Deb, that is a 15 minute mile!!! That is damn good time...you are working it, woman! My personal goal is a 12 minute mile but, and sadly, I am about 6 minutes away from that right now Glad you had a good weekend. That is so funny that you are cautious about greeting us with \"hi guys\" because of our hair!!!!! The lady in recovery this morning told me how great I look with short hair! Gross!  I think I look like my brother!  Also, on this note, my friend Greg is calling me \"Lou\" as I have short gray hair and no breasts!!!!!!!   Punks!!!!  Omaz: congrats on the mammo!!!!! Big YAY! Isn't it wonderful when you meet other survivors? Especially those with some years behind them. Glad you had a nice experience this morning. Iowa and JSW: you two will know when the time is right to get another cat. I still miss Mowgli but Bibbers found me! Just to answer the question, yes, my friend and I had been drinking a number of Coronas when we named Bibbers! In any case, it was about 8 months after Mowgli passed that Bibbers started following me around the parking lot of my job! She would wait for me to leave the building and follow me. Unfortunately she would not get in my car and my friends at work were teasing me that she was committed to her lifestyle and that I, of all people, should respect that!!!!!!! Jokers....in any case, I had a woman that could trap cats come out and get her off the property before something happened to her. In long, you both will know when the time is right, if ever, and they will find you! Well, this port removal spot is sore and I was at Yale from 6:30AM and was home by 11:30 so, coupled with my hot flashes, I am going to lay down!",

You veins can become unusable. I saw it with my mother and she never had chemo but tons of bloodwork and tests etc.. With chemo, though, I would not take chances. I think the port is best. You poor thing...what a dubious set of choices. As for cancerversary, mine is April 17th. Omaz: do you know of any particular problems I can have after the port is removed? Just wondering. It is painful right now but I am just trying to ignore it. Lady and Calamtykel: yes, I was awake. They asked me if I wanted to snooze out but b/c I had only 3.5 hours sleep last night, I figured that would just make me too groggy so they draped me with all the surgical stuff and had me turn my head and 20 minutes later, we were done. The only thing that bothered me was my tennis elbow or so they call it. I could also feel her tugging around in there while she was working. No big deal though; it did not bother me at all to be awake. Calamtykel: I am so glad your mom got a puppy! Good for her! Actually I should say has a puppy on \"order!\" Pets are so much company. I have cautioned myself against getting dogs in the past because of time constraints and now it would not be a prudent financial idea plus the time constraints loom large once I am done with this maddening stretch of surgeries anyway. I have not had a dog in 15 years but I will get one again some day. Good luck with the garden. Rachel: I always forget that you had cervical before bc. You are reaching nearing putting the bc anniversary behind you as well and that coupled with a clean mammo should send you on your way to never looking in the rearview mirror again! Iowa: tiger was beautiful. I am glad you got a memory rock. It is heartbreaking, I know. I am sorry your lost your furry pal. Both sides of my chest now have large bandages! Of course the one on the left is larger than the port bandage but, nonetheless, when I arrived to Yale this morning they were doing construction on the cancer area of the parking garage. I had to park in the regular, non-discounted parking area. When I came out and was leaving the garage I explained to the teller what happened and he took one look at all the bandages showing on my chest (as I was wearing a tank top) and my lack of hair, asked for my name and gave me the discounted rate!!!!! I must really look like I belong in a triage unit!",

My thumb, index and middle like to go numb when I am doing anything repetitive. Today I was going over flashcards on the recumbent bike and they went numb. Over the weekend I started my lawnmower and used it on the side of the house and my hand went totally numb, the entire hand. Today on the treadmill it happened again. I am afraid to say anything because a neurologist might be next. Oh well...if it gets worse I am going to have to open my trap!! I was reading NYT online (Source: www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/nyr... and found this startling statistic: '...The audit examined waiting times at nine health care facilities in the 2009 fiscal year and found that the worst were at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, where women had to wait 148 calendar days for routine screening mammograms and 50 working days for diagnostic mammograms, when cancer is suspected.' I was so stunned. When cancer *is* suspected they have to wait 50 days! I am stunned. I just signed up for the Komenforthecure walk and no wonder they want us to raise funds for more testing centers/sites. I was surprised when I read that so I wanted to do some research and, sure enough, I found that out about NY.  How scary is that?  Omaz: Good news for you! In my research over these past few days, I found that CT and RI, the tiniest states in the union, have the *highest* incidence of breast cancer and AZ has the lowest!  You all are doing something right out there in the desert!  How many more Herceptins do you have? JSW: I measured my hair today and it is just over 1\"...it is all so exciting! You finished up a few weeks after me, and are still on herceptin, so I am letting you know I am only a little bit ahead of you and I am already passed 1\"! Ckptry: she suggested maybe a one surgery step to just put the implants in. That seemed like something I might consider. Also, all the ladies I have met in the cancer unit speak so highly of her. I think also because she is obviously a woman, this makes a lot of difference. I am so glad I found a female PS that comes highly recommended. On the skin care, because I don't have kids, I am not so much concerned about costs and therefore when I told you about Lancome etc... it is expensive. Same thing with Graham Webb but you really pay for what you get. I was just joking when I mentioned you might not want any more of my (high end) recommendations! At the very least I do try to point you in the right direction! BTW, one of the best things you can do for your skin and that which is terribly inexpensive is steam with fresh lemon slices once a week and then open VIt E capsules, while your pores are still opened from the steam, and apply it directly to your face, all over your face and b/c it is E, you don't have to avoid the \"sensitive\" eye area. How are your kids doing? Are things getting a little easier for you? I hope you are using those PTA offers, woman! Lady: we will be here for you every step of the way, all summer. It will go by fast, you will see. Definitely get in touch with your doc for some pain meds and something to help you sleep. I so remember that awful run-down feeling from chemo. It was terrible but I will promise you that once it is over, it is over and your energy does return. I don't feel so hot these days because of the hot flashes all night but certainly I will take the hot flashes over the alternative! Tex: have yourself a wonderful night!   I hope you had some fun for yourself today and that which did not involve a minimum 3 hour drive!  It was so funny as a few weeks ago I was talking to my brother who was driving from Houston to Dallas and he said he had been on the road for just over 3 hours.  In response to my surprise he said \"Liz, Texas isn't like freakin' CT where you can drive through the entire state in 47 minutes!!!!!\"   He is such a jerk ass!   Oh, btw, the company he works for has an office in Dallas and he was going there for lunch!   He also calls his vehicle a \"cowboy cadillac\" which is a Ford F150!!!  Well, I should get to bed so the hot flashes can begin! I am having the weirdest dreams...really weird! Before chemo I never remembered my dreams and now, after chemo, every night it is like some psychedelic movie! Weirdo movie...like a Tarrantino deal! I don't like it! Good night, all-",

I went to the dermatologist today (anyone in CT that reads this thread and needs a dermatologist referral, don't hesitate to ask, she is with Yale and is *excellent*) to get a suspicious black mark on my face looked at. I hope I give you all a good laugh....Ms. Facials and high-end skin care over here could not recognize a BLACK HEAD staring at her!!! I was moderately embarrassed! There were a few other things I was there for but that was the funniest! For those of you who saw \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,\" you will understand this next one. I have a dark patch of skin below where my right breast used to be and I did not know what it was. I wanted to have that checked out. Well a few weeks ago my friend and her husband were here and he said the brown spot might be Leroy, my brother from another mother (!), and that if he grows some hair, we will give him some dreads!!!! He said just like the aunt in Big Fat Greek with the lump on her neck that contained a tooth and some hair from her unborn sister, he is my \"unhatched\" brother!!!! The dermatologist got a big kick out of that one! So I had the brain CT and was pissed because I went to one building after having been told twice, including 2 hours prior when I called to see if I could have breakfast, and sure enough I arrive and had to go to another building...was a little upset! In any case, they said \"technically\" the scans look great which basically means they took a good pic! I so hated to have that dye in my head but it has to be done. I have a little headache now and will inform you all when I get the results of the scan. I am sooooo hoping and praying all is fine and those weird headaches were ocular. Tex: how did you become fluent in Spanish? Did you study? Believe it or not, Ms. Japanese-and-Chinese over here did not have such a good time of French and Spanish! I mean I got good grades but I found the gender specific conjugating annoying at best! That dance move called \"Andale\" in Zumba is actually part of a Mexican dance. I have done it while in Mexico and am now upset because I want to know what the name of that dance, that includes that Andale step from Zumba, is!!!!!!  I know my drunk ass did it...perhaps not well but blame it on the Cabo Wabo!  BTW, if you can salsa, meringue and cumbia, you will LOVE Zumba! You need to get it! The package with the Zumba sticks (sound like marachas-love them!) is $70 at Amazon. Ladyinbama: I wondered what happened to you! I missed hearing from you and seeing those cute little dogs! Having good times at the lake house? I hope you are doing well. Rachel: that is a great group that you found especially because the kids can meet other kids similarly situated. I am so happy that you found that group. It really helps the kids not feel socially alone. Plus there are things they will say to their friends and share feelings they are having which they will never share with an adult and/or parent. I am really glad they embraced it as well in talking about the new friends they met. That is good stuff! Sptmm: with the amount of working out you do, your heart will just fine, woman!!!! No worries at all! Andale, andale!!!! Do they do the andale step in your class? I love the Amazon thing because I have learned everything I need to actually do it in a gym! There is an instructional dvd which is great and I got 2 Zumba sticks, a cardio workout, a toning workout (cardio with very a dab of toning!), a 20 minute dvd and 2 live dvds and have been doing it for 1 month now. I have lost 18 lbs (or lost what I gained over chemo days!) and feel healthier than I have in over a year now. BTW, using the answering machine to avoid drama whackos is a great idea! I don't care if they are family or not, if they are acting weird about your dx/bc/situation, they must be avoided. The only people I kept around me through this entire thing are those that I laugh with...that is it!  Omaz: your docs know best. Celexa is one of the antidepressants that does not mess with Tamox. From this link: www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/ne...    I found this out: The breast cancer recurrence rate among women taking tamoxifen and the weaker antidepressants Celexa, Lexapro, or Luvox and was similar to that of women taking tamoxifen alone. I am sure you will feel better. Celexa is in the mild category. This is the problem with antidepressants and tamox: Tamoxifen mixes with a liver enzyme called CYP2D6 in the body to change into the tumor-fighter endoxifen. Many SSRIs block the same enzyme, thus preventing tamoxifen from morphing into its active form. I think you have to be above 20mgs to have it become a real issue anyway. I hope it helps you. Let me know how it goes.  I wish you the best.  Believe me when I tell you, as I threw my little tantrum about being sent to the wrong building, I reflected on what you have been saying about tamox, hormones and overall bitchiness!   Calamtykel: I can't remember the name of the test now (unbelievable!) that I had right after chemo to check my heart and be sure that it did not go down. I think that test, if the number has gone down substantially, indicates the potential for future heart problems and those that are not showing today. My number went down one point. If you feel better, get an echo. I may have had one and I just don't remember! Nuclear med does the test I am talking about....I know others here know what I am talking about! The box comes close to your face...ugh..I know JSW and Zenith both know what I am talking about...perhaps that dye is having an effect already! Well, now I guess I am going to drive myself bananas researching the deleterious effects of CT scan dye! Goodnight all-",

OMG-my hair is growing into a very bizarre looking, rather uneven crew cut! The VNA comes once a week and today she had some nursing students with her. They were, at the same time, giggling and then remarking that it looks cute!!! No, I don't have a complex now or anything! IowaSue: so sorry for the delayed response. When the weather is nice in the Northeast, roughly 20 days a year (!), we have to get out and enjoy! In any case, I had bmx with immediate recon. June 22 is one year since I had my surgery and I *still* have 1 TE in and an infected hole where my other breast used to me. I thank God every day I have such a good sense of humor because I sure need it the way this has turned out! I was in the hospital for only one day and really everything went well. The hardest part was getting used to trying to sleep with those bedraggled JP drains. Any questions, feel free. I am here. Sptmm: you're back!!!!! Whew...I was getting nervous! As for the new PS, I just kind of need a doc with a little bit more of a serious practice. In fact, I feel bad for those PSs with flighty, aesthetic practices who, out of professional courtesy, take on bc patients. BC patients need more PSs like my new one. I really hope more women become PSs and deal, in large part, with bc patients. Quite frankly, on this matter, I do kind of feel more comfortable with a woman anyway. Additionally she is very intuitive. I like that a lot. She was very pleasant and comes so highly regarded, I must go with her. My previous one was fine but his entire demographic was skinny white women and that was it. As a demographic, they are the most disenfranchised with their bodies. For this reason, his aesthetic practice fills a need in society and I will travel on to more serious outlets! It is all good, Deb! Good luck on Monday. I will sure be sending good vibes. As for the leaking, the PS gave me AVD pads (I think that is the acronym and I will correct later if I am wrong) which are large and very absorbent. You would be able to find them at a medical supplies store. No more pelvic sonos until September is great news! Enjoy the summer, woman! As for the numbness, thanks for letting me know you, too, had this. I am so aggravated that it is BOTH hands now. The thumb, index and middle on both, not at the same time. Also, I wake up with the left almost always numb. Like you, I don't want any more docs now. I go to the onc in June. I will see what it is like between now and then. Unfortunately it is always when I am doing repetitive movements. This is a little scary. Ckptry: That absolutely is just awful what you are going through. These schools absolutely love their labels also. Did you ask them about the test or do they allow you to be present when they give the test? Don't forget, schools are bureaucracies and they exist in municipal nation where when they need to justify needing additional funds, they know how to do it. Oft times these programs are cash cows for the schools and these days, both having the numbers that justify more money but also cutting the services to those who need it (the numbers), is the name of the game. Have you considered calling the DPH in NJ or contacting your local alderperson? Continually asking the same snake not to bite you never works. I would create a municipal army to stand up for what my child needs. These people want our votes and take our money, let them get their asses to work. Keep on the phone and on these people. Write letters, make phone calls and keep it going. What is going to lead to you getting really upset is feeling helpless. As long as you are doing something, you will not get to this point. I would say if you have to be put through this, take a whole bunch of those municipal monsters and politicians with you. Manage it like a business; write letters, make notes in Outlook of dates and times and who you spoke with, what the upshot was etc... and then keep going. I know, it takes a lot of effort but if you want EVER want something from the municipalities/town hall/the state, you must fight. Put on different boxing gloves this time, I say, because that first rainy day wasn't your last and don't let them put you off. Be very calm and hang in there. They get you when they can get you \"emotional,\" one of their favorite \"labels.\" I am so sorry you have to go through this. I hate to mention this but definitely take your sister to that meeting and take a nerve pill before you go. Getting upset and crying is just going to divert the attention from your daughter's plight. Definitely bring your sister and I am no advocate of drug-taking but in this case, I would try something. If you decide to take something, take it the day before as a trial run to make sure you are not too dopey on it! You can channel me all you want! I can be a serious bitch and have no compunction about telling someone/anyone where to go however, but when dealing with these gross municipal thieves, sugar is your best ingredient! It is funny, speaking of rainy days, I was speaking to a good friend of mine who, when I told her I had tapped the rainy day fund, said \u2018no, don't touch that!!!!!!!!' Um, listen here, the *rainy day* is upon me!! If bc is not a rainy day, what the heck is?! I am very happy Aidan can zip line! I am such a big kid...I wish they had ziplines when I was young!! OMG...speaking of fun, I saw on CPTV this weekend we have a great, \"real\" water park in Portland, CT! It is so cool! It is on a lake with water trampolines and water skiing, jumps off of rock cliffs, a number of zip lines over the lake where you let go and drop into the lake! I mean it is a real \"action\" park...so much fun and exercise. I will post after my first trip! BTW, good idea on letter-writing. Write it, walk away for 1 hour, come back and see if you like how it reads and then send it off. Don't forget, less expensive than a lawyer and probably better for you, a personal assistant/advocate to deal with phone calls, letters, etc... and I am only pretty sure, in this econ, you can score big especially in the very educated tri-state area in which you reside. JSW: finished rads and heading on vaca!!!!!!! Nice...very nice! Good for you! I hope you have a blast with your short hair and your rads-free body! Onemonga: good to hear from you! I wish you well with sciatica. It seems to come and go. Some 15 years ago I had it a bit. No idea what caused it and nothing since..yay! Good luck to you and thanks for stopping by! Sohardbnme: Amen to that! Texas: what is going on, woman?! I am still trying those links....gadzooks! One thing: I was very happy to find that site. Good stuff! Omaz: How are you doing on the tamox now?  Are things getting better?  I am still in hot flash, USA over here!  What really unnerves me is no matter how upset I get, I am not the type to \"go red in the face.\"  Now, I can be having a very amicable conversation and it looks like I am getting upset because my face is flushing!!!  Oh boy...the joys, the joys!  Well, girls, time for me to irrigate the wound!

Ckptry: your 6 y/o sounds pretty smart with the SAT words roughly 8 years before most kids would have that type of vocab!  Nice!   I could be wrong, but Lupron and Arimidex for 5 years, especially weekly shots, sounds like a lot.  I don't blame you for deciding against it.  I am so very sorry that you had such a tough time with it.  I am totally with on the fact that they don't know if we are cancer free.  I am, after all, getting headaches where it feels there is a little gun filled with rubber bullets firing toward my skull in an attempt to escape my brain (I can hear you all now!!!!!!!) and the scan shows nothing.  Ok, scans don't show anything until cancer is a pretty decent size so when they start with the semantics of \"survivorship\" and \"cancer-free\" I just can't buy in.  They don't realize, I assume, the impact such words can have.  Honestly, I will never consider myself \"cancer-free\" and for this reason, as I have said before, I don't embrace the vernacular at all.  I do however know there is a lot that can be done to help us and for this I am grateful.  Stick to your guns and do what is best for you.  If I had any troubles on tamox, aside from hot flashes, I would have gotten off of it.   I hope you have a nice, relaxing Saturday night!  You might want to check into SNL if you are up that late as it is actually funny again!!!",

      "Content": "May 20, 2011 01:38PM - edited May 20, 2011 01:41PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, CANCER WARRIORS! I have decided we all deserved a new group name!!!!   We are now the warriors!!!  As most of us (those left!) are done with chemo and rads, we needed a new moniker celebrating the NEW FRONTIER!!!!! Sptmm: is there really something called \"chemo curl?\" Should I infer most people have their hair come back curly after chemo? Mine was curly before and one of my docs was telling me that you generally get the opposite of what you had going into chemo so I was hoping for some straight hair! In any case, with the excellent flat irons I have, it really does not matter as I straighten it with ease when it grows back in! Those swirls are starting to grow even taller...it all looks so weird! As for the ease of short hair, I think it is easier for me now, at this length, because I just shower and go. I know in a few months, however, and with the NE humidity, I am going to have a rat's nest on my hands! As for the survivorship clinic, I am very happy with it. I think it is wonderful that I can start my list of questions now and by the time I go back, be able to get some answers to the eclectic mix of questions that plague my mind. They told me there aren't any plans for scans. I guess they just go on how I feel and, if I am feeling something weird, then off to the scans I go. Geez...there is a big part of me that wishes it was a bit more definitive! Cancer has several monikers and I am not going to share with you the one I am thinking about right now! Omaz: your hair looked great a month ago so I am sure it is time for a chopping! It is so exciting our hair is coming back and you actually have enough growth to get a hair cut! Hey, I did not realize until later you were on the coffee thread the other day! I am so tired of conflicting reports about the damn coffee business! I have been off coffee for almost a year. Sometimes I want to have it again. I am thinking I might have 1 cup on Sundays and will do Starbucks decaf. I do kind of miss coffee. Rachel: ENJOY the time off!!!!!!!! Another 8 weeks gets you over ½ way through summer....relax and soak it up, sister! The survivorship clinic is wonderful but you spoke of \"courses\" in your post. What courses are you taking? I think a more comprehensive clinic with courses would be great but you have heard me time and again casting aspersions at our grotesquely capitalistic healthcare system so I am sure it is good ol' money that causes us not to be able to have some classes to take! Tex: Send me the link for the ribbon. I will change my avatar to in support of you. This is a ridiculous segue but I must tell you! When I was talking to the PT, as I said these people are all cancer survivors, I asked what kind he had and it was testicular. He was happy to report his wife is now pregnant and they are so very happy! He is blessed to be having a child and I told him I look forward to pics on my next visit as I think his wife is due in the next month. In any case, I asked him if he saw \"Dodge Ball\" and he quickly responded with \u2018that was the best cameo I have ever seen!' referring to Lance Armstrong when he is in the airport bar in Vegas and he meets Vince Vaughn who is down on his luck, about to give up. That is when Lance says something like \"well, I was about to give up when I was diagnosed with testicular, brain and lung cancer but I fought through and won the Tour De France again!!!\" It was hysterical! I hope you are a \"Dodge Ball\" fan and, if you are not, please hop over to NetFlix and rent yourself a treat! If Lance Armstrong could do it, so can we! OMG...speaking of Lance, it is now coming out, I think in an upcoming 60 minutes, how he was \"on something\" when he won at one point or another. It is some tell-all book by a slime ball looking to make a few bucks. In any case, a lot of that stuff has carcinogenic properties so we are ahead of him on that note! Well, we have 5 minutes of sun so I should hop on outside and make hay!!!  Speaking of hopping, my *indoor* cat was on her perch going bananas as the cutest little bunny made it's way across my backyard!  It was sooo cute!   Man, we have been in a pattern of rain for about a week. Oh well, when I think of the tornadoe devastation in the south, I am happy that all we get is rain up here. Those poor people and now the floods on the Mississippi...it is sad for the people who seem to run the risk of annually losing everything. In long, I will take CT and it's no-Spring, humid summers and lightly snowy winters (****normally!!!!). Speaking of tornadoes, does anyone understand why first the people in the South, who have been through quite enough, now have to deal with Charlie Sheen?!   Additionally, and I know this is a ridiculous question, but does anyone else's brain squeeze a little bit when you hear him say \"torpedoes against tornadoes??!!\"  It just does not make a lick of sense....not that he does anyway!   Someone put a fork in him...he is done!  He should leave those poor people alone!  They have been through enough without his nonsense!   Good day all and GO SEE BRIDES MAIDS!!!!!!!! Laugh a little!",

It is so fun and low impact. It is really all just Latin dance moves but it is so much fun! I find myself smiling right through it! The marinades are great. They are so easy for someone like me who is rather inept in the kitchen. Actually not inept but a lot of marinades are full of fat, sugar and sodium so I never really gravitated toward that type of cooking. Quite frankly, if I can toss it on the grill or under the broiler, I am good! For this reason, I found these marinades both manageable from an unwanted calorie and ingredients perspective as well as tasty combinations. Has anyone else heard about cancer and \"charred\" food? I read an article a few days ago how if you have had cancer you should not be eating charred or blackened food when it is cooked to close to the flame like grilling and broiling. I was kind of surprised to read that but then, somewhere in the recesses of my mind, I seem to remember learning something about that before. Anyone else know about this? Carolyn: good luck at the school. I hope it all works out. Relays: has anyone gotten involved in relays and, if so, how did you do it? I go to the ACS site and quickly get frustrated. It is hard to find relays and then when you do find something, it is closed etc... . I am going to try, try again but if anyone has any \"relay\" links, please send them! I am getting to the point where I would like to go out and socialize with other victims of this mad disease and I am finding it hard to find them....except for in the waiting room at Yale! I am going to Yale in early June and hopefully I can learn more there and I will call the ACS sometime this week but if any of you know something more, please let me in on it! Sptmm: You are going to love his book. The thing with Mark is that he was in good shape all his life and then put on 60 lbs as he got a little older and he took the weight off but he felt like crap because he was starving all the time. After much research and deliberation over his mother's lifelong battle with weight, he found out the reason why people are so hungry when they reduce calories to lose weight. What he shows you how to do, and not with the big recipe nonsense like you find in South Beach etc..., is to eat small amounts of whole foods in a synergistic way all day to stabilize your blood sugar so you are not ravenous. I really think he needs to run the Dept of Obesity in this country! I am serious, after you read his book you will realize it is all so simple and you don't have to buy 100 ingredients...it is all just real basic stuff. As for the shins, yoga will fix those. Down dog and just before child's pose you normally sit on your heels, trying not to let your toes point in, and this will stretch the shins out. As for Sheen, I do feel bad because he is deeply troubled and it is like watching a \"Faces of Death\" video in slow motion, I agree. It is sad. I do sincerely hope he straightens up but in the interim he should not terrorize people in the south who have enough to worry about and probably look at his arrival as a tsunami coming after the tornadoes already wrecked the place! It is great that Taylor is 18 and wants cupcakes. I think these kids grow up way too fast these days and for what? Nothing, that's what! Lady: your avatar is so cute! You look like a little kid eager to open a present!  I love it! I am looking forward to your Christmas photos when you hair will look like that again ;) I hope chemo goes ok this week. Good vibes to you, woman! Texas: I hope you are having good times down there in good ol' Texas! As for me, I have been lazy today. I even took a nap this afternoon! Sunday is truly my day of rest. I was also on YouTube lamenting the \"voting off\" of Haley Reinhart from Idol.  Now we have those 2 teenage country crooners left(no offense to country fans!)!  That girl is talented.  I hope she gets more deals.  I mean she did Zeppelin ...who on Idol can even do Zeppelin?! She was fantastic on \"House of the Rising Sun\" too.  She also did a fantastic job on Adelle's I(I initially wrote Lady Antabellum as I was watching a commercial for the Billboard Awards and tyepd their name!)  \"Rolling in the Deep\" and likewise with \"Benny and the Jets.\"  I hope she gets a record deal.  Her style is remarkably that of Lady Antebellum, only the most popular artist in the world right now!  Have a good night, all. I am going to hunker down and watch some wonderful TV! Later, gators-",

Don't forget, those that never had it can still do all they want but those of us who have need to avoid waking up it's potential. I am so glad you found a decent place in Birmingham...good for you! Being near a mall never hurts! You know, JSW, your house might take some time to sell but I am sure it will. I even noticed on Ebay, things have slowed and on Craig's, things have come to a halt because of all these \"I moved to Africa with my church to save children\" stories all about wiring money etc.... They have decimated CL. I just think it might take a little time but not to worry, you can always rent while you are gone to Birmingham for a year and until you know where/if you will be moving after Birmingham. All things to consider. Also, so glad the tamox is treating you well. Good deal! Sptmm: you like to live on the edge!!!!! SUNBURN?!?!? OMG.....unbelievable...we talked about the SPF4000!!!!!!! Guaranteed to keep you chicken white all summer...ain't post-bc life just grand?!?! The way it looks on surgery is probably late Aug/early September so at the very latest, I can plan for October. I just don't want drains and TEs etc... when we do our tour! BTW, I will eat anything I want but I noticed lately every time after I eat my stomach is upset. For this reason I did not want to eat this weekend. Deb, I love Fire Island! One of the guys I worked with had a house there and then my friend and I rented a house one weekend ....he is gay and spent more time in the water taxi going back and forth to bars and fighting with the boys!!!! Aside from that, the rest of us had a blast! I don't blame your son for not wanting to win! Go Fire Island! That is so sweet that your son left his friends and went to exercise with you! What a nice story! I know what you mean about the hotel gyms...some of them are just eerily located. As I am a gym rat, I am always scoping that out and I like to wear my headphones when I workout...at least at gyms anyway. I am so glad I spent the money and took the time to build a home gym...so tired of that gym nonsense! OMG...this weekend I realized on my Weider double pro I can do mule kicks (for the old rear end!!!!!!!!!!) I was so excited! There is a similar machine at the gym, in the freeweight area but, to be honest, the position you have to get in to use it is sort of profane so I never did! Now I can do it in my home...yay! I finally figured out why the leg press plate went out so far!! Tex: I am a wicked happy drunk!!!! I have had a lot of fun times and, in fact, at times like in the Wall St days when I was upset or stressed, I do not drink. Drinking is something I only do when I am spirited myself! You are right, to each their own....I miss having some mojitos, margaritas and beers in the summer. Maybe I will feel more confident next summer? I can't believe your kids had school today! Even in the Northeast with our several days-off-from-school due to snow, they were off today. That is macabre....especially in TX! Speaking of TX and municipal policy, I saw your Gov on Greta Van Sustren the other night. My brother \"loves\" him and hopes he runs in 2012. Apparently he is thinking about it. He seems like a good guy...any opinions either way? Just wondering. I have had birds outside my windows singing all weekend! It is so beautiful! I hope you all have a good night, all-",

Ginger: I took the plunge!!! I colored it! I whipped out the box and got going! I used John Frieda foam something or other. I actually went probably 2 shades darker because the gray and brown mix was just looking horrible and I wanted to clean it up. One question: when can I shampoo it again? Just wondering...good information to have! Your puppy sounds so cute!!! I love animals. I went to make my monthly donation at the humane society and there was a bulletin posted on how the town does not want the humane society to take in cats anymore. I was flabbergasted. Of course the woman who runs it is no shrinking violet so she listed, next to this bulletin, all the names of the town politicians we should contact. Needless to say, I have been busy on that project! I am just so glad you got a dog. I think they are such great companions and there are just fun to have around. My friend Mike the Greek (not joking!) told me all he saw in my future was me driving around in my Range Rover with my dog in the passenger seat!!!!! In fact, that sounds about right! Adey: so glad you are clear. I really do think it is scar tissue. I won't feel better about this until Yale confirms my suspicion but, oh my god, what a scare. Are you keeping busy out there in Chi? I hope you are having some nice spring weather. JSW: not for nothing but that range from your elbow to your thumb regarding cording is a total PITA relative to being able to stretch it out. You know what you can do, however, is stand with your feet together and tilt your head to one side. Extend your arm away from your side and with your arm extended, and not moving your wrist, make a fist. Then what you want to do is take your fist only and flex it back and forth from the wrist. What you want to do is move your fist toward the back of your body and then bring it back to the starting position. If you do that 15 times on each side, that will loosen up that area. Oh...I feel for you. Any more snaps on the house? I hope you get a buyer soon. Texas: what is going on, woman?! I hope you are doing well....Zumba-ing your way through life! Perhaps you are at some kick ball championships! I hope you are well. I almost forgot to tell you guys: The FDA is having another hearing for Roche on reviewing the drug Avastatin, which is used for ovarian, colon and a few other cancers, for use with bc patients. I have not investigated the entire story but apparently the FDA still feels, in some way, that the risks might outweigh the benefits for bc patients. I am going to investigate it and will report more later this week. Happy trails and I hope everyone has sweet dreams!",

I will definitely be praying that you sell you have a lot of lookers at your house! May the force be with you! As for hair, mine is about ½\" to ¾\" now. I am only pretty sure that I will be going without a hat soon. Although, to be honest, I love baseball caps so perhaps I will move on to visors next! Ckptry: you would not have been able to, with great aplomb, take a compliment about your hairlessness?!! Geez....!!!!! I am just looking forward to a nice short do and I have actually been thinking about my \"stops\" and how I will fashion my hair on my way to a longer look (probably 2 years!) In any case, good for you on ditching the hat during hot flashes! Omaz: I am so glad you liked your training session! Speaking of dandelions, I really don't like using RoundUP and the other weed killers but those dandelions are coming back up mighty fast after the mowing! In any case, I am sorry you *look* like a dandelion gone to seed! Lady: how are things going? How is chemo treating you this time? Did you have a good Mother's Day? I hope your friends and family were spared loss in those tornadoes and am very happy everything was fine for you. Well, I have become a television head and \"Dancing with the Stars\" is on! Then tomorrow night is \"The Voice\" and then Weds and Thurs is Idol...bc has made me a total TV head! Good night, all",

Lady: that is what they were saying on CNBC how it is currently used for ovarian and prostate. They want to expand it to bc and are currently having hearings with the fda. The FDA is resistant because they feel the risks outweigh benefits, as I mentioned in my first post. Of course, the market on bc is humongous and no doubt that is what precipitates the drug makers interest in expanding it to bc. Who knows? If the FDA deems it ok then perhaps it is not all about capitalism! Calamtykel: question: because you seem to know an awful lot about the estrogens and nutrition links, and I am hoping the connection to soy, I was wondering what your feeling is on a protein powder where Lecithin is the 3rd from the last ingredient? I purchased a GNC protein powder. They had zero powders without soy. Just wondering if you have an opinion either way. Tex: yeah...she is kind of young for the all star thing! There is always next year. My nephew made all stars for baseball. He pitches and catches. He is pretty talented from what my (biased) brother says! Ckptry: I think you are absolutely right in that Aidan could teach those kids something about making friends. The story still breaks my heart. I am glad they are coming to your house. Sptmm: hope you are doing well over there on the island! I am very happy with our weather....I will never forget January 2011!! Hope you are having some good days, woman! Well, time for me to get to bed! I hope you all have a good night and I will not post my scares anymore until I know for sure what is going on! It is just that sometimes the comforting words from you all are priceless. Thanks to you all for making bc as positive an experience as it could be",

It was so nice of your friend to, on behalf of everyone in the fight, to make her tractor a beacon. I love how it says \"fight like a girl\" on the fender?! I bet it feels good to have breasts again. I was thinking that next week is 1 year since I have not had breasts. Mine were big so I don't miss them but I might like to have a little something again soon! Lady: how are you doing with chemo? I have been thinking about you. I hope that soon that chemo will be over and you can finally have some peace. Rachel: I am glad you are getting away on vaca. I definitely think you need it even though you are going to Disney! Only joking...it is a great place. As for the mx, the recurrence rates and the fact that breasts are just fat sacks hanging off my pec muscles, I found them to be expendable. I know it takes a lot of thinking and reflecting but to get rid of some worry, I could totally understand why you might consider it. Best of luck with that very tough decision. Ginger: my joints still ache post chemo. I have been dxd with fibromyalgia. The pain just does not stop. I have also, since shortly after and perhaps during chemo, developed numbness in my thumb, index and middle fingers on both hands but never at the same time and one hand experiences it more than the other. On the one hand that experiences it more than the other, it has spread to my ring finger. It comes and goes. Omaz: thanks for the ocean breeze, woman! I am glad you had a nice vaca. I lived on the beach for years and, to be honest, I could never live in a landlocked area. I even get a little nervous leaving the tri-state area for too long! For instance, a vaca for me by the 7th day is getting long. I kind of like 5 days except Europe/Mexico/PacRim where the very the lengthy travel forces a longer vacation. In any case, you must feel refreshed! I sooo love the \"no-mets tiki!\" Thanks for thinking of us! BTW, my hair is probably going to look like that after I mess it up with this box color trip I am on! My brows are holding up but they are sparse. I used to have thick eyebrows. I kind of miss that. Texas: a double Cherrios box?! I am sorry...how much could that have cost them?!? That is ridiculous. I enjoy it. I also enjoy bidding. It is fun.  I still can't believe they charged all this money for shipping and they sent a cereal box!  That is disgusting.  Sometimes I offer free shipping when I know I can get it in a small flat-rate, USPS box.   It makes buyers feel good when they are getting free shipping!  Ginger: any time, I will be happy to help you with Ebay. Just let me know and I will PM my phone number. Some things are better talked about rather than trying to explain over a thread! Also, you can donate some of your proceeds from your sales to charities or the entire amount, less Ebay fees, if you wish so I would not just get rid of stuff. Sell it and donate. Well, I am tired and chilly! I love summer but what I really like is when it is blazing hot during the day and those nice, tepid nights! Soon enough I am sure I will be whining that I am on fire!!!

I tried everything and he just would not leave and he wouldn't wear his fake teeth in the house....it was awful...just awful! In any case, while I was up I remembered an old song from the 80's and developed our new mantra! I present our new warrior mantra taken from the song by the eighties group \"Scandal\" aptly called \"The Warrior!\": \"Shootin' at the walls of cancer, bang, bang, we are the warriors Well we are the warriors, and heart to heart we'll win and we will survive as warriors....as warriors\" For those of you unfamiliar with this song/group, here is the link to the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn9lpMUJOq8 Adey: I really thought you were going for the Scandal song and subconsciously you planted a seed!!!!!!!! How are you these days? New boobs in September...yay! Lady: you see how much he scares me?! I am having nightmares about him!? I feel really bad for you guys that you are subjected to crackpots at a time when so many have lost so much through natural disaster, not cocaine, and here comes satan trying to improve his image on the backs of those who have lost so much. It is a travesty. Whatever he did not snort should be used to buy an island anywhere but here where he can his barely legal hookers and live cocaine-filled ever after!  Alas we have a younger, very handsome cutie pie with his real teeth and no known drug habits on 2 1/2 Men!  Everything works out!  I am sorry about your hair but only a few more txs and you will be in regrowth again. Actually the timing could not have been better as you will have the least hair in the hottest months and your hair will be back just in time for the coldest months....not too shabby! Ckptry: BEST OF LUCK today. I will be sending good vibes. It is such a double-edged sword that the fact that something \"might\" be wrong will also get them the services they require. Perhaps there is nothing wrong and these tests will just serve to get them the services they need. My heart goes out to you. This annual rough patch shall pass. Let us know how it all turns out. SAMayo: thanks so much for the Iowa update. I really appreciate it and it is so great to hear she is doing well! Sptmm: that is so funny about how they remember *after* you have been through all the scan madness AND their memory is sketchy at best! You are correct about the scans etc... but I just hope that some day we have a less radiologic way of determining if cancer is resurrecting itself in our bodies. Oh well...some day and I will probably be long gone....oh wait, isn't that today?!?!? Do you know people actually made money off of this guy's lunacy? Some people started a business telling people they would take care of their PETS after they were gone and that business, as of last night, had almost 300 clients!!!!!!! Reality has it all over Hollywood! I hope Taylor has a lovely 18th! I hope you have a great weekend, Gabe! Ginger: glad you had a good experience with the new doc. My friend is a pharmacist and finally found a doc that actually asked for *her* opinion before prescribing something!!! My friend was flabbergasted! It is the first time in her 40 years a doctor actually consulted her first so I think it is wonderful that your doc, in the same vein, is not relying on the standard and is going to do some research. Finding a doc that does not feel they know it all is helpful. On the dentist, ask at least 10 people with great smiles who their dentist is! That is the best way to find a great dentist unless, of course, you already have found one! Good luck- Rachel: at the Survivor Clinic they told me the aches and pains must, for the most part, be attributed to non-cancerous sources. Shins will hurt in the first few weeks of getting back to working out. If you are running outside obviously that is a huge catalyst. Also, if you are using a treadmill never hold on. Always keep your posture correct and your arms either at your sides or moving. Holding on causes incorrect posture and, as a result, other problems. A stretch that can be done on stairs to loosen the shin area is step up and then drag the one foot you left on the floor up against the stair below you until your toes are in line with the lip of the stair and hold that stretch. Sitting on your heels will also stretch this area out. Definitely stretch for 10 minutes before working out. I made a stretching play list and that helps to get me through stretching and also regulates the amount of time I am spending stretching. Down dog with heels to the floor will also ameliorate that shin situation as times goes on. Best of luck to you ending those shin pains as I am no stranger to them and know they really suck! Speaking of fueling our bodies, the other day at Survivorship Clinic, I was given a bunch of handouts. I have been reading them all week and last night stumbled upon this little nugget: If you take a piece of paper and make a chart with 4 rows and 3 columns and label the first one \"acidic\", the second one \"herb\" and the 3rd \"flavoring\" you can create a list of mix-n-match marinades. It is so cool. Here goes: Under the heading in column 1 called acidic you list lemon juice, orange juice and vinegar. Under the second column labeled herb you list tarragon, dill or cilantro (in the same box), and thyme. In the 3rd column you list garlic, chopped green onion and peeled and grated fresh ginger root. You can combine any one ingredient from each category to make a marinade and you just make it to taste....no measuring...my kind of marinade recipe!! Isn't that fantastic!? For those of you who want the actual table, email me and I will send it to you. Also, for those who like ginger root (I love it), it can popped right in the freezer and taken out and grated into whatever dish you want, and then just toss it right back in the freezer. I hope you all are having a good day-",

The fat, the fat, the fat!!!!!  How could I forget to tell you all where the fat comes from  ---there are case studies upon case studies of women who are 5'5\"ish and weigh in the 110 to 125 range and they have all had success.  The lowest weight I saw aws 95 lbs. I think if you are like 80 lbs maybe you would not be eligible but the bottom line is women's bodies like to collect fat and store it on our hips, ass and across our abdomen, not to mention inner thighs!  In the end there is no shortage of fat on any woman to do this surgery AND the places they do take it from are the ass, hips, inner thigh, stomach, back, inner knee...wherever they can get it.  All they are doing is giving the fat in your body a new address!    Sptmm: as for working out, after 20 years in gyms I find that 75-80% of people who workout regularly are bulge battlers big time and people who are naturally on the slender side are never in a gym.  My metabolism, even on 125mcg of synthroid, is like mud mixed with molasses and paste!!!!  That is all I can think of!  My working out just gets it moving but it totally lacks normalcy.   In fact, Sunday night was out with friends and had fried calamari and bruschetta and am still working it off !!!!!  It is rough, woman!   I am still very excited about this new development in breast recon and that I can join in! I am willing to be a case study because so many women will be so happy to have this option.  In fact, I think deciding on an mx/bmx won't be so hard when you know the docs can just move fat from elsewhere in your body and recreate your breast.  I am cautiously optimistic about all of this!",

Sptmm: I might give it a whirl...not sure yet because the hot flashes are so awful, all I can think is there I will be, seconds from relief, dying of a hot flash and unable to help myself!!!!!!!   As for a storied life, I always considered myself a late bloomer as I did not hit Wall St until I was nearly 28 and had been engaged, living with my fiance and working in CT when my father was dx'd with lung cancer when I was 26 and my mother had a massive stroke a month later.  I always thought my getting going later was so I could have more time with my parents as they would both be, for all intents and purposes, snapped out of my life at a young age.  My father died 3 years later and my mother never fully recovered.  She is in a full care facility now and there is hardly even a trace of the woman she once was left.   In any case, I tell you this because I have lived an awful lot and done a lot and if I apply the same math of my late blooming to my doing a lot of living in a short period of time, I hope that does not translate to I won't be here for too long!!!  I think I am going to toss the abacus!   BTW, I would gladly take you around Manhattan on a tour.   I know you mentioned that recently.  No problem but it would have to be the Fall as I don't trek Manhattan in the summer!  I forget you grew up in FL and are on the island via marriage.  I always think of LIs as being an extension of Manhattan anyway so I just assumed...!  In any case, I hope you have a great time at the game this weeekend. Lady: get out to that lake house and forget about life for a while...totally disengage and enjoy yourself ;) Omaz: I am not sure I can concur as last night I slept with my a/c on full blast and snuggled under my comforter and LOVED IT!  Plus it was the first night with no hot flashes or, if I had one the room was too cold and I did not wake from it! I am also sad to say that I find myself, much like these menopause commercials, standing in the frozen foods section with the doors open pretending to look for something aka cooling off!!!  I guess we are in different places on this one.  I hope you have a good holiday weekend and oh, btw, a new word for you (at least maybe it will be!): pilose: covered with hair, especially soft hair; furry.  I learned it in the crossword a few days ago and as your family is petting you, it seemed rather appropriate to share!  Is anyone else box-dying their hair and, if so, any reco's on brands?  I am seriously considering it as it is so short right now an it might be fun to experiment with some box coloring for the first time in my life!  I was just watching MSNBC as I enjoy Alexis Witt on Saturday mornings. In any case, through Twitter etc... they usually poll to find out what people are doing this weekend.  Well, although *they* say things are getting better, the responses this morning sure did not sound like it!  One guy said he is staying home watching car racing, another was working in her garden, another was going to a child's athletic game etc.. and all I could think was how many of those people, like me, were heading to MA, RI or NJ beaches on this weekend in years past and now the econ has squeezed everyone so much that those plans are no longer as feasible as they once were.   Ok well, I promised a few appearances even though I would much rather stay home!  I have to go to some back yard events, not drink, not eat, avoid bugs and/or eating a bug, hope it does not rain and then try to extricate myself as quickly as possible so I can come home and watch baseball!!!!!!!!!!! I hope everyone has a nice weekend-",

Calamtykel: I was getting sick after I eat.  Then I realized it might be that I started having coffee again.  I have cut the coffee but I still get a little sick.  Off to my GP I went.  He ordered a sonogram and bloodwork.  The woman who did the sonogram is the one who found my breast cancer.  In any case, there she goes with that machine, rolling over one spot on my side where I have had pain since the end of chemo.  Don't forget pain is usually a good sign as cancer usually does not cause us pain etc... (as we all know!).   In any case, because of my bc dx, and because they did find a mass in my liver, I have to have a CT scan.  I am sure it is nothing and my GP is not overly concerned so I will have a CT scan.   It is this daunting precariousness that we all live with now.  I am slowly adjusting!  Kel, also I have had that pain on both sides along my rib cage and I do believe it is crunches and I do jog in place for 1 minute for high intensity during Zumba.  Recently I noticed those pains along my ribs and for 2 days I was really sore.  Now clearly my jogging for 1 minute intervals in place, on a supported surface, is nothing compared to your running outdoors but I do notice those pains.  Recently I moved my high intensity bursts to the mini trampoline.  I also noticed when I did floor crunches instead of med ball while sitting on the bosu or trampoline or using the lounger or doer, caused me those rib pains.  In long, I think both of our pains in the rib area is exercise induced. Kel, btw, I totally agree with your head-to-toe inventory!!!   That was funny!   I think just getting back to life, getting over this wound and surgeries and getting back to a sense of normalcy is going to help me to stop being so focused on this self-dxing for bc mets daily!!!!  It's crazy!  Lady: thanks for the remainder that your's was benign!   I am cautiously optimistic.  Also there is no fluid in my stomach which is indicative of liver cancer.   I hope it is all fine and I was just getting stomach sick from having coffee daily.  Sunday, however, is my day off from all restrictions and I will be having some coffee today!! he he he!   I like coffee but I think chemo wore out my stomach and I just can't have it daily anymore.   Good day, girls...going to the mall!   Geesh...I really am such a shadow of my former, metropolitan self!  The mall....!",

Some day, Kel, they are all going to be cut down to size. I guess the truly advantageous will get MBAs instead of going to med school when the money is sucked out of that game. At least, however, what we will end up with are doctors who are practicing not for money but to actually care for patients. We will get real doctors then.",

Ginger: I am so very glad you might not have any extreme SEs.  I think moving across the country in a mid-bc battle was quite enough for a lifetime.  BTW, the woman in Norwalk has garnered national attention, the Norwalk PD and Town Hall are no longer talking to reporters and now we find out another woman was arrested in Stratford because her daughter lived in Milford (the adjacent town) and used her mom's address to put the kids in school in Stratford.  Apparently things are tough on the mom of the kids and she moves a lot so she wanted her kids to go to one school.  Both mom and daughter were arrested for that one.  This is making me sick and as soon as I don't have a hole in my chest, I am going to these rallies.  This is disgusting.  Omaz: thanks for letting me know.  Sometimes when I hear you all talk about tumor markers and these blood tests, I wonder why I have not heard of/been required to have any of these things.   Carolyn:  that story about Aidan breaks my heart.  In a related situation, someone I know raised her kids to be bullies.  They were teasing a kid on the bus for being fat.   The mother of the bullied child came to the \"bullies\" house to request that she teach the kids better and have them stop being so mean to her son.  This person, sorry to say, told the women to get the hell off her property and to put her kid on a diet.   I was so appalled.  Needless to say, I kept my distance from that person after that.   I just feel bad that there is no sensitivity training for kids.  The parents are brutes and the kids grow up to be the same.  I am glad you are keeping Aidan home and spoiling him rotten!  Good for you!  It is so heart breaking to watch kids go through struggles. I am sorry that on top of everything else, you have to deal with that. Thanks for the tip on the hair color. I think my *non-highlighted* hair is about the same color as your's.  I was thinking this Sunday I am going to be brave and dye it as it is about 20% gray.  I think I am going to use the color you did.  I will let you know what happens!!!!!  Who cares if I screw it up...I will just get another, darker box color!!!!   I hope herceptin goes well.  I am so glad we have all these txs and we are all doing pretty well.  Something to be thankful for.  As for scans, I think the further I move from chemo and surgeries and the more normal my life gets, perhaps in a year or so, the more I am going to want scans!  My docs say no scans until there seems to be a problem, which seems to be the prevailing wisdom.  I just think when things really get back to normal I suspect I will be getting anxious and wanting scans.  Part of the entire bc process, no doubt! Get out and enjoy this day! ",

I went to my niece's graduation tonight and it was just so beautiful and nice to see the blue sky, barely any clouds and nice, dry air! Oh, what a beautiful day and an even more beautiful night. OMG...I had HAIR success today! I used my Sebastian \"Get A Grip\" as I stopped whining and started styling (as my B(gay)FF Greg told me!) and it worked! The stuff is like glue but when it dries, it holds and your hair stays soft. I also finished it off with a little Sebastian Polish and it actually looked nice. More to this point, I am thinking when it grows about another inch (1 more year!) I will actually keep it short. I spiked it on top and smoothed it on the sides. For the first time in months, I felt human. I actually put on make up and jewelry and I started to feel like my old self again....it was nice ! BTW, here is a link to \"Get A Grip\" in case anyone wants to try it: http://www.amazon.com/SEBASTIAN-LAMINATES-Get-Grip-5-1/dp/B003IHJNVO Calamtykel: what happened today? Any results? I was really looking forward to hearing from you. Perhaps you are knocked out from all your water riding and subsequent begging the children to stay at the amusement park and allow you to keep sliding! I seriously hope all is well. Please let us know when you find out. Sptmm: Deb...I love the Belly Dancing DVD! It is great! Yes, it sure does help to get the hips moving. In fact, I am doing it tomorrow and looking forward to it. Psychovegetative seems like psychobabble! Texas: I did not mean to be insensitive...I am sorry. You are NED anyway so you are officially stage NOTHING! The very best of the stages! I am sorry.. I just meant you would have company Please disregard...I feel bad now The last thing I want to do is make you feel bad...you know I am always joking! I am sorry. Omaz: that is great news about your friend. I mean it is good and bad news! Great that the uterine was non-aggressive and doing the CT scan caught the kidney but, of course, bad that she has any masses at all. Are you ever just dumbfounded at the surreptitious nature of this disease? Where the hell does it come from and why does it keep setting up camp in human beings and animals. I mean, we know it is in domestic pets but what about those in the wild? Surely they are dying of cancer and we don't even know it. It is a very strange situation and I wonder when/if they will call it an epidemic. It is very much a worldwide disease. It is all so weird. You know how they say your \"questions\" will be answered in the end? I wonder if, when I expire, will I find out what causes cancer!? I know, that is a very odd train of thought but I can't help it! This disease makes one really wonder. I am tired and should be getting to bed now before the \"workers\" come over tomorrow and start making noise tomorrow! Happy trails, all-",

A humongous tree fell in my back yard during those storms a few nights ago. All I could think was how long it took for it to grow so big. It was a beautiful pine and looked so nice in the winter with snow on it. Alas there are more where that came from. I was also running around going crazy finding boxes for stuff I sold on Ebay. I can't believe how hard it is to find shipping boxes. I finally went to Walmart as a friend suggested it. Sure enough they gave me a box. There has been other stuff keeping me busy also. Calamtykel: I never remember being let out of school for the heat! Never! As for the whey, I am going to keep it. I am so confused but then I remembered the nutritionist at Survivorship Clinic telling me some soy is not bad. She told me some stuff but of course I forgot so I am going to bring the protein powder with me in July and see what she says. I like this powder also. I shall see. As for what we could wear to school, my mother let me wear what I wanted and there was no way I was wearing skirts. In kindergarten these 2 boys kept pulling up my dress and that was enough for me. In fact, a few years later they wanted to put me in Catholic school and I screamed, himmed and hawed! It was not until years later that I finally told my parents why I would not go to Catholic school = have to wear a skirt every day!!!!! My mother was hysterical when she found out! As for mammos, they always hurt like hell. Awful. Take these big DD boobs and smush them down to pancakes....ugh...something I will not miss. Ckptry: I was thinking of Aidan and I am so glad that procedure is over with. I cannot believe that foolish nurse declaring what he was having done. Sensitivity training, people. That was awful. I am glad he was en route the procedure and you were able to do damage control. As for your mom, call the PTA. Ask your friends you met through other channels to help. No, our bc changes nothing about our families. I gave up long ago expecting any of them to change for any reason. They might be a little nicer during bc but the original version shall emerge. My father always told me to \u2018know people for what they are.' I never really knew what that meant until now. Those nurses must have wanted to squeeze him in his little, clown pj's asking about having the cookies ready!!!!!!! Soooo cute!!! |I can't believe you had your first mammos at 30 and bc was not found until 44. I agree, we need better detection. As for the doc at MSK, that is great that she/he gave you the papers for your sisters to get annual MRIs that must be paid for by their insurance. Now that is professionalism. Sptmm: Now we have fall weather again!!!!!!! I wanted to go to some tag sales this morning and it was pouring and like 55 degrees out! Well, we certainly get variety in the northeast! Thanks for asking about survivorship clinic. I go again in July. BTW, I saw the kale article and then I lost the link because I left the page too quick and when I went back, it was gone. I have yet to embrace kale...! Rachel: relaxation/meditation classes don't work as well as vodka!!!! Man, after what you have been through (and all of us for that matter) it is nearly impossible to not be afraid and running down the nightmare of what could be going on/wrong. I feel for you. It is a lot to think about and then having to wait for appts just allows more time for thinking. I hope you are doing ok. Tex: definitely get the anti-anxiety meds. I take xanax in the middle of the night if I am up on the \"what if\" highway. I think they will do you a world of good. I hope you have a blast at Sea World! I love the amusement parks. When I used to go to FL a lot to see my mom, I would fly into Tampa (whole family lived on Gulf coast), pick up my rental and hit Busch Gardens just to ride 3 or 4 coasters and then on I would go to my destination! I am really just a big kid! Well tonight I tried to go to Red Box but there was like 4 people in line. I have never used it but a friend suggested I try because it is so great blah blah! It is so cheap is what he should have said and that is why it is so busy! In any case, it is freezing here tonight...well 52 degrees and that is cold for me. I am tired and it is off to sleep land! Happy trails, guys-",

My nephew had a baby!  I am a great aunt for the 5th time!!!!   She is soo beautiful.  I saw her tonight.   Mom, dad and the baby are all fine!  She was born Sunday morning at 3:40AM.   She is so cute...really looks like my nephew. Lady: I hope you get out to the lake house and find some peace for yourself.   Soon, soon, soon you will be done with those other txs and feeling better again.  I am looking forward to hearing you are done.  You sure have been through a lot and for this, I am sorry.  I am just glad everything was caught and you are on the mend. JSW: what is going on?  I meant to tell you I am taking 2 baby aspirin a day   So far I still have 1 head and no new lumps so it is going well!!!!!  Hope you are doing well and had a good time in Baltimore. Kel and Rachel: my heart goes out to both of you.  Don't forget I was just there last week.  Also, just because he \"touched\" it and declared it was scar tissue does not really put me at ease.  I mean I really don't have a choice but I am still a little concerned.  I guess it is just something we will always live with. Sptmm: I have been meaning to tell you for a while that I build portable aerobics floors.  For instance, if you wanted to do Zumba at home, like in your basement, this floor is shipped in 2'x2' sections.  It can then be put together either temporarily or permanently depending on what the buyer wants. In any case, after I sell enough of these, we will meet in Westchester and open our own gym!!!!!  A long held goal of mine is actually to own a gym/spa.  I like the old style spa gyms with the eucalytpus room, steam, sauna, plush locker rooms, spinning studios, stretching studios etc.... What I am trying to tell you is get ready for us to open our own Westchester Health Club!   So how is belly dancing?  I have been waiting for your report on that class! Omaz: I miss Sweeney, Lisasinglem and Onemonga amongst others.  I just think for a lot of people, putting bc behind them includes leaving a thread like this that reminds them of the hardest part of the bc battle = chemo.   It is totally healthy and natural that if someone feels better not coming back to the thread, then they should move on.   Understanding that does not make us miss them less, however! I still derive and lot of support and encouragement from all of you and I appreciate our smallish group now. Texas: my nephew in TX pitched 4 innings, caught for the 5th and then closed the game!!!  Unbelievable!  I can 't wait to go and see him in the beginning of next season.  I am also a baseball fan so it is a natural interest for me.  I hope you are doing well and getting ready for Sea World! Anyone have any exciting plans for the 4th?  I am going to try to not get too loaded and avoid being hit by errant fireworks!!!!!  I am such a high achiever!!!!!11 Cantaloupe: I love cantaloupe but b/c I live alone, I can never eat it all before it goes bad.  Well good ol' google led me to a site where I learned I could freeze my cantaloupe and then eat it when it is still slightly froze and it becomes like a luscious, healthy popsicle!!!!  I thought I would share that with you all Sweet dreams to all and to all, a good night-",

      "Content": "Jun 25, 2011 03:19AM - edited Jun 25, 2011 03:23AM by 1WonderWoman Good day warriors- I am really starting to believe we are epitomizing our new title, warriors! Geesh...we are all having quite a time of it. I feel like I am falling apart. BTW, sorry to drop all my \"medical\" problems in one post yesterday! I really felt bad. I usually don't share so much but I am getting very aggravated. I think someone here touched upon this before but I truly believe there should be an oncologic GP in the cancer circuit. A sort of catch-all doc that we see when we are having post-bc and post-chemo problems. There needs to be another doctor in the mix. I think it was Rachel who was pondering which doc to call when she was having a post-tx problem. I totally agree with her and everyone else who has pointed out that inadequacy in the oncologic world. Their favorite is to try to say \"your hip hurt/you were bleeding out of your ass/you had a full beard/your joints hurt/you were numb/you were sick to your stomach\" all before chemo and CHEMO has nothing to do with these problems. BULLSHIT! As if I have to tell you all, I am just waking up to some of the crap I have been through and I am not happy. Ckptry: >>>>Started PT last week but it wasn't helping the hip pain. Sexy. Bring on the support hose and excess facial hair, between the creaky joints and the sahara down below feel like that's just around the corner.<<<< LMAO!!!   I am sure you were not trying to be funny but I could not help having a good laugh!!!!! I am so sorry but I am with you! We all feel the same way. My sister said the other day she was not sure how I did it and handled it all so well without a husband.  I did it by keeping good friends and happy, upbeat people around me who were not looking for sex and other things I could not provide/did not feel up to providing!! I reminded her that I THANK GOD I did not have a husband with my total lack of interest in \"that,\" the \"sahara\" as you aptly put it, the lack of boobs and the total disinterest with dealing with anyone else's drama while I fully embrace my own. I even dumped the guy I was seeing because I guess he thought I was still \"in the mood\" while I was going through= NO, get to stepping!!! As for marriage, I understand it is \"til death do you part\" but I would feel bad if I had a husband right now with my inability to \"entertain\" him. I mean, I would try and make an effort, even if he did not expect it but, at the same time, I would lament the passing of my desire and longing to be there for him! In fact, sorry to say, I might give him a hall pass!!! I just don't believe in matrimonial jailing! I just feel that all the women with children and husbands while going through this bc dx and txs are truly super heroes. I don't know how you all do it/did it/continue to do it and do it so well. Women are the most selfless creatures ever created. Lady: I am so glad you got all your heart tests done and your docs are watching out for you. I am so very happy. Please let us know your results. I am looking forward to hearing nothing but good news and celebrating with you when you are finally done with this second batch of chemo! Long live and prosper the very strong and resilient Ladyinbama! As for surgery and cancer, you are correct in that it is very much a double-edged sword. The entire event is like taking a trip to Spooksville USA! Omaz: as for survivorship clinic, they are very good. I will see them in a month. I will have gotten all my answers by then. Sadly, I also found out that gastrointestinal pain and chapped lips combined are a sign of a gastrointestinal problem. My lips are all puffed up, red and cracked. I am putting vitamin e (breaking open the capsules and using the guts!) and vaseline on my lips. They have been like this for over 2 months. How are you feeling these days? Have you gone back to the trainer? Did you ever check out Zumba? I want to know what is going on with you! Calamtykel: can you please post and let us know what happened yesterday?? Please, please, please. I am very worried about you and your silence is concerning me. I hope you are just busy and have not had a chance to post. As for me, I am getting a sonogram of my stomach next week and a full blood panel. I am also getting this lump checked out by another outfit. Do we really have to work so hard, with great health insurance, to get the answers and help that we need? Opprobrious remuneration for next to nothing comes to mind again. And you know who I think the true heroes are in the whole mix besides my GP?! The nurses. They are the ones who have been the most kind, empathetic and understanding that god gave them 2 ears and 1 mouth for a reason. God help us!!!!!!!! The battle for proper medical attention wages on.",

Tex: LMAO on the grandma from \"Napoleon Dynamite!!!!!!!!!\" Your DH is very funny!!!!!!! I almost pissed my pants at this party recently because this girl who came with my friend's cousin, looked like \"Jacinta\" from \"Super Bad!!!!!\" My friend's brother had me laughing so hard I barely made it to the bathroom! Napoleon and Super are in the same genre and I could not help but be reminded! Dude, that freakin' school is a joke! MY GOD! You have been fighting cancer and of course will not be laying out thousands of dollars for nursing school after a year like you have had! I would not waste time, however, because once Obama is out of office, they are going to slice and dice student loans like you would not believe. I would call those schools, give them your credit/debit card over the phone and get those requests in. Try, try to get it done asap. If the schools won't release your transcript/lost your requests, go to the school's website, download the transcript request form, go to www.myfax.com and set up an online fax service (if you don't have a fax already) which is free for 1 month. Fax those transcript requests in. I would get it done asap. I would scramble to get into school for September because I think there is a good chance Perry will defeat Obama and the Republicans are going to do 2 things: Flip Roe V Wade and kill financial aid and student loans. I am telling you, it is not going to be long before I move to Ireland or Italy. Tex, seriously do what you can to get into school NOW. Best of luck- I can't believe the kids have to go to school in 110 degree heat?! I just spoke with my nephew and I forgot to ask him if he went back to school yet. Isn't this really early for school, Tex? Omaz: nice avatar! You look so much like a desert scene from AZ!!!!!!!! Rachel: back to work?! Wow...must feel good. Good for you. Makes you feel like you are human again! Sweeney: Sandra :Rinamotto! She is great. I love \"Property Virgins\" and I love the guy with the black hair on \"Curb Appeal!\" He looks so good with that tan and that smile and that wicked nice hair! My ex told me I reminded him of Sandra with the way I deliver information!!!! He is an ex for many, many reasons! BTW, I knew she was from Canada....she has a Canadian (Bacon) accent!!! You know, we are pretty broke down here in the US with our credit downgrade and lack of employment.....\"Canadian Bacon\" might not be far off!!! Some still think we have a war-based economy and a war with Canada might fix us up just right!!!!!!!! The woman from \"For Rent\" is from Canada, too, I believe. I just love HGTV. Tonight is \"Design Star!!!\" I can't wait...I even put a reminder in my BBerry like I might forget! I hope you all have a good night and please, please don't forget at this time last year we were all getting ready for chemo and were collectively nervous wrecks. Just think how much better this August is. Have a great night everyone and reflect on this past year with an eye to the future.",

May you have the most minimal/no SEs for this very last tx. I wish you the best. Please stop by and post to let us know how you are during this recovery. Texas: did your kids melt at school?! I cannot believe they had to go to school. Speaking of which, I spoke to my nephew from Houston last night and totally forgot to ask him if they were back in school yet. Poor, poor Tex's kids! Calamtykel: my day was equally as berserk. I woke at 7AM for no apparent reason and shortly thereafter my phone rang. It was my sister to tell me my nephew and his wife were in a head-on collision. Thankfully the baby was not with them. What a day...I was flying out of bed, fumbling in the closet and before I knew it I was on the highway en route the hospital. Kel, it is awful when an emergency strikes and the house is a mess!!! Geesh, makes you feel really great, doesn't it?! I am just really glad to hear your son is ok. Your DH's heart must have skipped a few beats seeing all that activity at your house. How scary to drive up to such a scene. I am just so glad your son's eyes are ok. Sweeney: did you ever see \"Canadian Bacon\" with John Candy and Rick Moranis? It is a hysterical movie where the US goes to war with Canada basically because we are bored and have no one to fight with!! It is very funny and you should do a $1 rental if you can find it. It is roughly 15 years old but you can probably get it at Amazon for less than a $1! Gingerbrew: welcome back, woman! I wondered where you have been! I cannot believe it was your GD's first birthday already! YAY! I was holding my great niece today, who is all of 3 months old, and she is so beautiful, I just love her! I am just so glad you are doing well and had a nice party for her. The kids must have absolutely adored that pool with the balls in it! What a great idea. As for me, still packing the wound but it is getting close enough to being closed that they will now open the other side, in September, take out that failed TE and then I will have to pack that manmade hole for several more months...and the beat goes on! All I know is I have Yankee tickets for LATE SEPTEMBER v Red Sox and I have fantastic seats!!! I am not missing that game for anything! I am going to see my PS next week and will be discussing doing surgery the last week in September. Honestly, though, if she says I need to go sooner, I will. Either way, surgery or not, I am making that game! Stop by and keep in touch, woman! Great to hear from you. Omaz: as noted above, I am still packing the wound but it has gotten much smaller. After they open the other side, we have to wait 4-6 months for that wound, which I will be packing again daily, to heal before she can start the last and final phase of reconstruction. All things considered, I should be fully reconstructed by May of next year and then the last surgery, which who knows when that will take place, is nipple recon and that probably won't be for 1 year from now. This has been the longest road ever and I am so petrified with having these massive open wounds that I will get an infection etc... it is just scary but alas I have no choice. How are you doing these days? Your hair sounds just great. I know you asked Ginger about her numbness and I am wondering how you are doing with that? I am still, to this day, getting alternating numbness in both hands, affecting the first 3 fingers on each hand and sometimes, rarely, the 4th finger. It is quite intermittent but like yesterday I got scared because when it happened I could not seem to wake my hand up for quite a while. I just don't know, woman! Weird stuff, indeed. I always have to remind myself any residual peccadillos, including the inconvenience of numb fingers, is wicked better than the alternative! As for law school, just studying for the LSATs now.  I want to take a Kaplan prep-course but have to wait for this next surgery to be done and get 3 months or so out from that.  I think I will probably take a prep course in January.   I hope to start law school in January of 2013.  I don't think I am going to be ready to get the ball rolling for September 2012.   I am probably going to end up in the Boston area.  As much as I talk about moving to a warmer climate, I will probably buy a house in FL and rent in Boston when I start school.  Thanks for asking.  I am so excited about this!   I am really looking forward to it. Question for everyone: my lips have been awfully chapped and burnt since about 1-2 months after chemo ended. My GP said I might be allergic to something in those juicy tubes I love and to lay off and just use Bert's or vaseline. Well I did that and still they are burnt and chapped. I don't what is going on. I called Yale to get an appt with my excellent dermatologist but like any excellent doctor, she is booked so I can't get in until September. It is the strangest thing. Anyone else rowing this boat with me?! Somehow I don't think so...! Sweet dreams, everyone!",

I am confident that is *the* only reason WFC is still standing.  I was going out with a guy who had night classes in WTC and I used to walk across the catwalk and would meet him, he would have coffee for me and then I would go back to work and he would take class and we would meet later in Tall Ships or Moran's.   My friend that works for Martha Stewart in Midtown as well as other friends that worked in Midtown, and those who worked in the buildings the planes passed over on their way to crash into WTC, all said the midtown buildings shook when those planes passed overhead.    One night after 9/11 I was at a Bank of America event at 14 Wall.  I was staying in Midtown.  Myself and 2 others, who I did not know, took a cab back to midtown and we were all feeling no pain.  When that cab driver, who was from the Middle East, drove me by that gaping hole that took my boyfriends life, killed countless friends and all but ruined my business, I have a verbal, liquor-induced exorcism all the way to midtown.  I really felt bad but I just lost it.  When I got to my hotel room, on the 63rd flr, I was talking to my friend Tony and I started flipping out because I could just make out red lights outside the window of my hotel room.  All I thought in that moment was they were lights on a plane and it was going to crash into my hotel.  It was, in fact, the GE building shooting fireworks off the top which was a nightly event for a while.  I could not make out through the sheer panels exactly what was happening.   It was all horrible. On a much lighter note, my friend Rich and I were in an Irish bar in Midtown (hard to find!) watching a great band and all of the sudden this rather loud man walks in, with a bloody fist and screaming \"I just punched out an Afghani cabbie!!!!\"   The whole place went crazy, people were buying him drinks, I was playing little Ms. Drunk Ass nurse trying to clean up his hand!   BTW, just for the record, I was not \"with\" Rich as he is gay...well most of the time he is gay!  I got my series 7 license while working in WTC and I still have my business cards, letter head, note pads etc.. with the WTC address on them.  I am just devastated.  I am going to post my 9/12/01 photoes on Flickr this weekend and will let you all know when I make them public.   There are a number of fairs in CT this weekend and other events but I think I will be mesmerized, lost in my reverie.  Close friends from NYC want me to come in but, as I said, I am not ready for that and am concerned about terrorism.  It is all such a real possibility now and if I was not just coming off a bc battle, I would go.  I just don't have it in me to go, be in a terrorist attack and have to scramble for my life.  This will be a cathartic weekend for me. ",

Best of luck to you as we are both in the hellified waiting room this weekend!   I hope your results are perfectly fine.   I think a 2 week period is way less concerning than spotting. I think that is what makes them uber concerned.    I am sure you will be fine and you are doing everything nutritionally and physically via exercise to take care of yourself and I am sure that will count for something.  You should embrace medical calmers this weekend also! I think I am going to make a white russian and then go to work on building out my aerobics floor!   I am in for the night so I can have a drink now!   ",

      "Content": "Jul 11, 2011 03:56AM - edited Jul 11, 2011 03:59AM by 1WonderWoman Good day warriors! I hope you all are doing just splendid today! Lady: I love your new avatar and if my damned CT scan is clear, and I don't have to have another dose of poision!, I have a bunch of hats like that and all the other \"head gear\" I purchased, and never wore, during chemo. If you would like some more of that stuff, I will gladly send them along! Elizabeth27: thank you so much for stopping by and wishing me well! I sure hope this is going to be ok but, as we are relegated to bc reality, I must always be prepared for the dubious fact that any of one of these tests can come back with news I do not want and that is simply par for the bc course! Good to hear from you just the same. How are you doing these days? I hope all is well with you. I think it is fantastic that all of the sudden we will hear from people who have not posted in a while. It is nice to hear from our silent supporters now and again! Texas: You're back!!!!!!!!! OMG...on do nothing vacations, one of my favorites was one Friday night after work on Wall St I was wiped and decided to head for JFK and skipped down to Sarasota to see my mom and ended up staying for 5 days! We just went to dinner, Walmart, the beach and I actually laid out by the pool at the \"Hampton Inn\" I stayed at! It was such a good time. Oh yeah, and we went to Busch Gardens also...had to feel my legs and arms hanging from a harness coaster and whipping through the wind to get back in touch with myself! It was really a take-it-easy vacation and I loved it! In fact, a close friend and I like to travel alone so we can do whatever we want, whenever we want. However, and only weeks after 9/11, she was en route Australia and wanted to stop in UAE! I was stunned as I am not that brave. In fact, if it is not Ireland, the UK, Spain, Italy, or Greece, I will not go alone. Even Italy scares me a bit now after what happened with Amanda Knox. In any case, a do-nothing vaca is great! I am so happy you got away and just had some nice family time. It is good for the soul! Good to have you back as I missed you! Ckptry: men can be so lazy and weird about stuff like not piling up pizza boxes in the garage! The last time I was engaged, every time I had an attitude about one of his peccadillos, he would go to the calendar to try to determine if I was PMSing!!!!!!!! Forbid I was, the wrath was awful! During my midsummer night's hot flashes last night I was watching an episode of \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" on TV Land. It was all about his wife PMSing and how he was trying to get her to take pills! The underlying message was every time we question their nonsense we must be PMSing and we must immediately take a pill to make our dissatisfaction go away!!!! It was very funny. Oddly enough my sister was just mentioning to me the other day how she thought we would have worked out!! First off, I read the Wall St Journal and he read comic books...case and point! He was cute, however! Even worse, he was a few years older than me still reading juvenile nonsense....he was cute, though, did I mention that?!??!!!! Sorry you had to be introduced to the pesky earwig in the garage...one of their favorite spots! I think there is a possum in my shed now...this place is getting like Noah's Ark replete with the coyote that almost scared the fur off of my cat as she watched \"Kitty Broadway\" which is the backyard at night! She loves to sit in this one window, where she has a perch, at the back of the house and watches all the goings on for about 3-4 hours every night. After he life along the highway, she never tries to get out, however! I think watching is quite enough but when that coyote came by, she came running into my bedroom and her fur was on end! I quickly ran to investigate and there went that coyote. We are seeing quite a few of them here. As for learning to let things slide, it is great in theory and not so good in practice. It takes time but if you could just take a deep breath and count back from 10 when you find yourself similarly situated, your dh might get out of the situation with his head still on his shoulders!!! It takes time, woman, all in good time. BTW, it does seem harder to organize things and I also feel like my coordination is off a bit. That drives me bananas! There are moves in Zumba I could always do and now I find myself not being able to put it together quite as I used to. Also yesterday I thought I organized the basement so there was a ratchet, vice grips, a wrench and pliers in the basement, upstairs and in the shed and sure enough, there was NOT in the basement. It really aggravated me...I thought I had done that! 1 year from the end of chemo...I think we will be better! Calamtykel: Kel, I wish I did not sleep last night! I had 1 drink last night and I ended up with nightmares! One where I was offered a city bus to give my nephew a ride home (dreams...!) and then these tattoo covered thugs came to menace myself, some of my cousins and nephew then they stole the bus and I was billed $1.5 million from the bus co for damages!!!!!!!! The other some creeps followed me home from a night club and I could not get my car in the garage fast enough because I had a huge beach ball on top of my car?! I would have preferred no sleep last night! Actually I met a woman on this site from Scotland who had a pretty time of it all and I think because of the EU, they are all pretty much on the same healthcare now. Good for you on ignoring the test business! I think we are all collectively growing through this process and starting to take it all a bit more in stride. I am glad to hear this from you.  It is not easy and we share the same goal. Omaz: cool new avatar! I have a bunch of wave pics called \"in the tube\" which are wonderful. I think I might change mine to something similar today! Tex: on the butch comment, I have a few friends that swim in the lady pond! They remind me no matter what I do/hairstyle I have, I would never be mistaken for belonging to their club but with the lack of boobs, baseball hats and androgynous dress (well now it is androgynous because I have no boobs and short hair and that is when Levi's and a t-shirt became androgynous!), I might look like a man!!!!!!! And, Tex, there will be no sacrificing of my little ground hog family! You had to hear this guy: he was talking like a nefarious group had moved into the neighborhood and we had to get rid of them! Ground hogs stay underground for 6 months of the year! C'mon do we really have to sacrifice them/open up ground hog relocation services because they are eating your sunflowers?! I felt like asking if we could please have a more substantive conversation or perhaps not at all?!?! Ckptry: don't ever apologize for \"so many\" posts! There is nothing to apologize for! Share and share as much as you would like whenever you would like! That is the nature of our little group here, woman! I am going to refrain from over-diagnosing myself for mets on google and get outside to spray so my little earwig friends understand there are boundaries! Good day, all-",

OMG...I had HAIR success today! I used my Sebastian \"Get A Grip\" as I stopped whining and started styling (as my B(gay)FF Greg told me!) and it worked! The stuff is like glue but when it dries, it holds and your hair stays soft. I also finished it off with a little Sebastian Polish and it actually looked nice. More to this point, I am thinking when it grows about another inch (1 more year!) I will actually keep it short. I spiked it on top and smoothed it on the sides. For the first time in months, I felt human. I actually put on make up and jewelry and I started to feel like my old self again....it was nice ! BTW, here is a link to \"Get A Grip\" in case anyone wants to try it: http://www.amazon.com/SEBASTIAN-LAMINATES-Get-Grip-5-1/dp/B003IHJNVO Calamtykel: what happened today? Any results? I was really looking forward to hearing from you. Perhaps you are knocked out from all your water riding and subsequent begging the children to stay at the amusement park and allow you to keep sliding! I seriously hope all is well. Please let us know when you find out. Sptmm: Deb...I love the Belly Dancing DVD! It is great! Yes, it sure does help to get the hips moving. In fact, I am doing it tomorrow and looking forward to it. Psychovegetative seems like psychobabble! Texas: I did not mean to be insensitive...I am sorry. You are NED anyway so you are officially stage NOTHING! The very best of the stages! I am sorry.. I just meant you would have company Please disregard...I feel bad now. The last thing I want to do is make you feel bad...you know I am always joking! I am sorry. Omaz: that is great news about your friend. I mean it is good and bad news! Great that the uterine was non-aggressive and doing the CT scan caught the kidney but, of course, bad that she has any masses at all. Are you ever just dumbfounded at the surreptitious nature of this disease? Where the hell does it come from and why does it keep setting up camp in human beings and animals. I mean, we know it is in domestic pets but what about those in the wild? Surely they are dying of cancer and we don't even know it. It is a very strange situation and I wonder when/if they will call it an epidemic. It is very much a worldwide disease. It is all so weird. You know how they say your \"questions\" will be answered in the end? I wonder if, when I expire, will I find out what causes cancer!? I know, that is a very odd train of thought but I can't help it! This disease makes one really wonder. I am tired and should be getting to bed now before the \"workers\" come over tomorrow and start making noise tomorrow! Happy trails, all-",

In fact, today I just sold 2 more books.  They are very fair also.  The way things sell on Amazon, on the marketplace, buyers really don't realize they are not buying from Amazon.  For this reason, very few people provide feedback.   It is not like the Ebay drama.  It is straightforward.   I like it.    Ecrater is great.  It is so wonderful how one can set up a store.  I do a lot of 9/11 art and I also make very high-end Wall St themed tables.  They are modern, on casters and are about the height of a bar table.   Last year with chemo I did nothing but this year will be more busy and I want to get going now.  I also have a holding company so I am just going to tuck the ecommerce, I am now more involved with, into the holding company so that and my other business can live in the same LLC.  I like it...a lot!  Without setting up a bunch of different websites I can sell everything at Ecrater. It is great. Congratulations on the chicken run!   It would be nice if they can range free but those foxes are diligent and hungry!

Or perhaps it is just the clouds but 103 degrees with a heat index of 110 is way too much for me! I really think I better get to the Carolinas where the extremities are not so bad! BTW, as I rant about the weather (surely you all must be tired of this!!) I am petrified of another winter like the last one. I do believe, as soon as I am through with my fake boobs, south or west, here I come! I cannot live in the central part of the country but I could easily do West Coast...or Uruguay...or Ireland....or almost anywhere but here! Another reason I want to leave CT: we have the dubious honor of having the HIGHEST GAS PRICE in the nation! As Kel, Carolyn and Deb can all attest to, we truly are human ATMs in the Northeast and everyone makes withdrawals! Omaz: OMG...I could not have said it better about the freezing in the AC then sweat bombs out of nowhere! I am just sitting still and all of the sudden heat miser comes around and sweat is pouring out of my arms and my head! It is not my favorite but certainly my health is better than a lot of people so I should be grateful that it is ONLY hot flashes! I am so glad you went back to your trainer! Good for you. There are great exercises for triceps like skull crushers! Ask your trainer to teach you those, seriously, and then drop it to the plex. Do 12 to the forehead and then 12 to the plex. You will get totally get a horseshoe in no time! Lifting is the reason why you can also consume extra calories, if you wish, because you need fuel for your muscles. I am so happy you are working with a trainer. If you have any questions on lifting/what to do about a certain body part, let me know. I will be more than happy and please, please, please, for the love of god, don't think you are going to get \"big\" from lifting!!!!!!!! That is the biggest fallacy in the universe! Consequently, and I have said this before, muscles are a jacket for the bones and after all that chemo and the fact that none of us are spring chickens, we have to consider that osteoporosis is avoidable through calcium intake and weightlifting. Go get em,' woman!!!!! We also have that sharing program in CT with the libraries. It is called ICONN here I believe. It is wonderful that I can order books from any library in CT and have it delivered to my local. A great feature and, yes, one remarkable example of tax dollars at work! Texas: I know why you have butterflies...b/c of the fear of LE!!!!!!!! I am literally a wreck over flying later this year. I have already flown but, of course, I was admonished for my cavalier attitude toward cabin pressure/altitude being a catalyst for LE and how I better straighten up and fly right! Now they told me I should \"definitely\" get fitted for a sleeve. I am going to try to put it off as long as possible b/c I have surgery again in late August/early September where they are taking out the other TE and then I have another open wound to fill for 6 months. Enough of my haranguing about LE (!), you might also be excited/nervous to see your family. That is natural. Usually I drink during the flight before visiting family! It is rather necessary in my opinion! I mean I don't get loaded but I definitely don't go sober either!!!!! I just hope you have a blast and enjoy your herceptin and your vacation! I also needed your advice: I sold a painting on Bonanza...should I ship it in a Cherrios box?!?!?!? Sptmm: you must be looking hotter than the weather in your nice, new, SIZE 12 bathing suit!!!!!!!!!! Whoo hoo! Good for you! You earned it and you should feel absolutely great to be out on the beach and enjoying yourself with your new, hot bod! You just might be the hottest bc survivor on LI!!!! I was, however, very disappointed to hear you mention \"sunscreen\" when I have written repeatedly discussed the need to use SPF 4000!!!!!!!! Plain old sunscreen...shameful...you obviously like to live right on the edge, Deb!!!!! Ckptry: don't be down on yourself! The bulk of the country is in your shoes but I will tell you, balance issues are very, very important as we get older and it is imperative that you try your best to work on that. Balance is why so many elderly fall down and get hurt which, in 30 years will be us! I would definitely buy a Bosu ball and you don't even have to do the video. Just practice standing on it and gaining your balance. It is excellent, excellent for balance exercises and for core training (wicked hard but gratifying to do crunches on that thing!). There are also balance boards and discs you can purchase. The boards and discs run $20-$30 generally but the Bosu is $99. It is, however, money well spent. I don't blame you for getting choked up when cancelling your gym membership. You have every right to...freakin' medical bills. I am so glad your gym is working with you. Daycare at the gym is just wonderful. I think that was easily one of the best things that ever came to gyms. Keep going, I am sure it will make you feel better. As for me and ecommerce, I make these cool frames that are boxes and I do all kinds of different themes, paint them etc... . I also absolutely love all kinds of industrial art AND I love, love, love making cool, industrial lamps using all kinds of metal, plumbing fixtures etc..! Ecommerce was the best thing that ever happened to me! This past year was for naught as I was going through this mess, as you know. I am finally starting to get back and am actually getting excited thinking about the coming holiday season. It feels good to feel that way again. I think Kel is more into it than I am so I am learning from her as I go.  Kel also has it all over me as she is involved with all this ecommerce and she home schools 4 kids!   I am a schleprock compared to her!!!!!!! Calamtykel: speaking of which, and I am sure you already know about these, but are you aware of plumdrop and bongo? Any thoughts on those? Oh, I also realized I do need my own website and then I will use ecrater for extra marketing and check-out. It is great not to have to have a merchant account through my website. I am one of the few who prefer to leave the merchant activity to Paypal and Google! I am finishing up a sketch of Randy Johnson for my nephew for his birthday. He is a really good pitcher (my nephew that is!) as is the great Randy Johnson! Also, my nephew does not come from \"tall\" people as my brother is roughly 5'8\" and my SIL is 4'11\" so I did some research on the top 10 greatest pitchers of all time under 6' tall! What I did was work them into the sketch by incorporating each one of those pitcher's names into the stadium wall ads! I also, rather cleverly, drew in to each ad, starting with \"The\" in the first ad, and when strung all together he will realize it says \"The Long Arm of the Law!\" I can't wait until he finds these things out on his own and calls me up! Like one of the billboard stadium wall ads reads \"Billy Pierce and Tattoo\" and, if any of you know about baseball, he is one of the greatest pitchers of all time...and under 6'! Well, this is what I will be working on today. I hope all is well in post-bc land for all of you. I don't know about you all but I am starting, just starting to feel like I am finally moving past this mess even with my surgeries ahead of me. It feels damn good! Good day, all-",

I hate to put the link out there on this site as I feel bco is sacred and not the place for me to be promoting my wares, as it were, and that is also why I never mentioned it much before. I thank you, though, for asking and I will keep you posted. August is going to be a busy month for me!   All good, however! Sptmm: my nephew can pitch and catch and does both very well.  He is going to be 13 on the 28th!  He is just a baby but has gone to the All Star team for the past 2 years, I believe.  I know he was on it this year.  I am very happy for him.  Early estimates says he goes pro.  We shall see.  My cousin went AA for the Rockies pitching but an irreparable shoulder injury sidelined him.  In any case, I just hope my nephew is enjoying himself.  Consequently, Kieran should not have to battle anything...look at Nick Swisher!  There are a number of shorter players, even in the NBA now, who are very talented.  I just think if you are over 5'5\", you have a good shot! OH, my IRISH tall tales!!!!  We will probably find out you were at a \"Shape\" magazine photo shoot for LI moms today!!!!!!!  he heh hehe!  I just think it is great and I am very happy for you....especially since Taylor helped you not get another CT scan over obliques!!!! Calamtykel: I am really pissed that your bills got turned over.  These hospitals are punks.  It is not like you owe $20K.  The social worker at the hospital is a great idea.  You should reach out to that person.  That was a good suggestion from Carolyn.  IN fact, part of survivorship clinic requires we meet with a soc worker,  One of her first questions was 'do you have any concerns about bills or money?'   I thought that was odd so clearly they are there to help.  I get the distinct impression if I said yes she would have had some ideas or assistance suggestions for me.  ",

I can safely say, and without complaint, we are having some good ol weather here in the Northeast...hot but dry...just the way I like it!!! Sptmm: I miss you, woman! Where are you? Maybe you are on a photo shoot for transatlantic sexy soccer moms and are now in Europe!??! Geesh...bc has definitely changed your life for the better!!!!! I hope you are doing well. I know you are busy but I can't help but write and tease you about your new, glamorous, shapely life!!!!! Omaz: her license? Your dd is getting her license?!? Yikes! That is a big one. I don't know what I would have done if I had kids. That is a big step! Good for her. I think it is great. It is a wonderful step toward her eventual independence. I think it is great. I know my friend's son does NOT want to get his license? My nephews cannot wait! I got mine the day I turned 16 and had a car waiting at my house registered, insured and ready to go! It was one of the most memorable days of my life. Congratulations on seeing the end of Herceptin! Good for you. I am so happy to hear that you are nearly finished. As for Tamox and eating, if you get that Mark MacDonald book, you actually are eating every 3 hours. That might help?  OR, workout a bunch so you can eat non-stop!!!!  The hot flashes are getting worse for me. I just start sweating, sweat pouring out of my arms (odd) and head. Oh well...that is a small price to pay, my friend! Calamtykel: I agree that there seem to be incredible strides in other areas of life but with cancer, it is at such a terribly lethargic pace. As for the post-chemo counseling, it was intimidated they don't do it because then it is like telling people *to* make changes and when they don't, in the event of recurrence, it is like they are getting blamed for not changing their lifestyles after dx. There is also some murky water with the insurance companies. Like if you were told and you did not, it could be a loophole. Also, relative to any sort of counseling, there is really no counseling they can give as they no nothing about what causes it therefore they can't tell anyone to make any changes because what would be the point of reference for dictating such changes? It is convoluted but I do know why they don't do it. As for scans, I think you should. I know it is a lot of exposure to rads but b/c you are not on tamox, I would do it. I know it is scary but I would go and get them done. You will feel better. As for lumps, I have not noticed any more lumpiness but, to be honest, I have not checked until tonight when I read your post. I did check after I read your post and did not find anything. I know it is hard not to check but I just give up with this disease. You don't know you have it, you don't know if it is spreading, you don't know anything so I just gave up with the checking business. Kel, sometimes your nodes can swell if you are fighting off an infection like you had that summer flu. Perhaps that is why they might be swollen. Relax and take it easy. I am sure you are fine. Question: would you ever reconsider tamox? Just wondering if you would consider going on it now that there is some distance between you and chemo and we are all getting back to our old selves a bit more. I hope you get some rest tonight. Rachel: do you have to have scans before you are released to go back to work? Congratulations, btw, on being released to go back. I am heading back into surgery in 5 weeks. My road has been very long. I hope your scans are clear. I know what you mean about doc appts. I have 4 in the next number of weeks...here we go! JSW: thanks, Lady! I have been wondering as well. I think she was traveling and moving also although I thought of her tonight. I was having dinner with friends and one of my friends gave me her P90 workout! I am so excited. JSW mentioned this a few months ago and I thought it was a weight loss drug!!! In any case, I am going to try it for sure. Lady: congratulations...only 1 left! Whew...I bet you are glad this is over with. Speaking of hair, I waxed my brows and upper lip about 2 weeks ago and normally I would have substantial regrowth but no, I did not. It is not even coming back....making me a little nervous! I hope you have been enjoying some time at your lake house.   Relax and remember, almost done with crappy chemo. It is official...I miss Tex!!!!!!!   And Sweeney and JSW and all the others who have disappeared into the wild!    I hope everyone has a good night and keep on truckin' girls!",

I hope you are all having a nice day.  I am done partying for the weekend (last night was enough!) and now it is time to get caught up on organizing and cleaning...no fun! Sptmm: screw the bills.  Consequently, and just so you know, I am only pretty sure you have equally as high utilities as I do here in CT and if you bills get behind while you are recovering, don't hesitate to have your doctor sign a form so you utils cannot be shut off.  I don't know what the form is called but the utils and your doc would most likely know.  My niece did that when her boyfriend was out of work with a back injury.   He was the only one working at that time.  Your recovery from mx could be as quick as 4 weeks anyway.   I know going out on STD is no picnic.  I just hate to see you going back for more surgeries after this next one.  Quite frankly, and I hate to cast aspersions, but after all this money and all this time, they still don't seem to know too much about cancer.  Rather than wait for the final path, I might just do it.  It is so much to think about, though, Deb, my heart goes out to you.   BTW, my surgery will be right around yours so, yes, we will be recovering together!  Workout pals!    Remember when that gas co wanted to put a gas plant in the middle of LI Sound promising LI and CT how much cheaper our gas would be?!   They were summarily trying to ruin our summer playground!  CAPITALISTIC PUNKS!  Our big savings, I am sure, would have lasted one season and then they would jack the rates.  I am so glad they did not get away with that. In any case, I hope you are having a nice day. Calamtykel: mine never came back.   I would talk to your onc or gyn about the crazy cycle business.  I know for us on tamox, they are concerned about irregularities.  For you, however, I am not convinced this crazy cycle business has much to do with anything besides your body recovering from chemo.  I am sure you are fine.  Somewhere I remember someone (doc etc...) saying it takes a good year for the body to fully recovery from chemo.  You are probably still just going through that part of it.  I am sorry I could not be more helpful.  Let me rattle the crew to get some more feedback....! HEY GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!   FEEDBACK ON YOUR CYCLES WANTED!!!!    LET'S COMFORT KEL WITH YOUR EXPERIENCES. Well, back to organizing I go.  I am really a pretty organized person and hate when things get messy as they have recently.    Good day, warriors!",

Tex, that was also a very good point about how research on other cancers leads to developments for bc.  For the record, btw, a 3 mile walk on a wicked hot day is more than sufficient exercise! Ckptry: been meaning to follow up on the comment about hoping your daughter has better options.   That tugs at my heart strings.  I think it is, I mean clearly intrinsic, but also just lovely that you think about bc and strides we can make today so she will have more options forbid she ever needs them.  I think i told you all about my friend's mom in the 70s where they ignored her so long and by the time they cut, which was a bmx and you were shoved out the door with some \"falsies\" to work with, it was way too late and she died within months.  In any event, we have come a long way so perhaps the \"pink\" stuff, in hopes it is not a front to raise money and not give it to the cause, is actually working to benefit us in some, albeit small, way. Night, girls and may the FORCE BE WITH YOU ALL!",

As for 80s all summer, New Hampshire! As for 80s year-round, I was watching HGTV yesterday and they were in S America and I forget the locale of course but it was 80s all year! You know what is funny, though? People in 3-4 season climates are more productive than those in perpetually cold or perpetually warm climates. Calamtykel: Sorry to hear about the Asperger's dx. I wish you well with that. As for the spotting, I am glad you made an appt with the onc. Please keep us posted on that. Life is not about the starting or end points but very much about the ride in between. I just don't know why this entire thread seems to be on one of the craziest roller coasters ever made, however!!!!! Dentist...I have to go soon. I finally made an eye appt as well. I know my rx has changed since chemo but was waiting for 6 months beyond chemo to get that checked. Ladyinbama: hope you are doing well, woman! Thinking of you. Well, girls, I have some nice weather to enjoy! Happy trails all-",

      "Content": "Oct 1, 2011 01:56PM - edited Oct 1, 2011 01:57PM by 1WonderWoman I discovered something so cool on Windows 7 tonight: if you press the windows button + tab at the same time, your screens will show up in the center of the screen sort of like cards and if you keep hitting tab, it scrolls through all open screens and keeps shuffling them, in sort of a rolodex fashion!   I don't care what the feds say about Bill Gates and antitrust nonsense, the bottom line is he made a better  mouse trap and I don't know what my life would be like without Microsoft!!!!!!  Sweeney:  I live with this awful fear that I am going to start a business, become really successful and then be diagnosed with mets and die just as I realize success again.   Let me tell you, I am not a woman that thought like this pre-bc.  This disease leaves you twisting mentally and also sometimes it does not take much to rattle my cage.   My patience and tolerance is low.  I share this with you because I think that under similar circumstances, it is entirely feasible I will be ruminating and driving myself crazy with replays and forecasting.   I have no idea what to expect in my future but my current findings are NOT good!   I am sure I will be joining you in such anomalous, previously very unLiz-like behavior! Something  I thought was strange for me: normally I will deal with everything head-on and right away.  In any case, when I first started chemo I ordered all those hats and wraps.  Well I decided, in one of my spare rooms, to make a hat wall so I could try them on and decide what I wanted to wear daily etc...  Well my friend came over with her husband and sister and she had previously seen my hat wall a few days earlier.  She decided to show her husband and sister and I could tell she was leading them in there to show them the wall and was sort of making fun of it.  Well, I knew at that time what she was doing but \"chemo Liz\" let it go.  Sure enough, we are on the train last week and this guy across from me is talking to me about the Yankees for like an hour (!) and then he tells me about his hat wall.  I looked right at her and said \"you thought you were pretty (expletive) funny mocking me for my hat wall, didn't you?  Showing your sister and your husband as if it was something to laugh about or that you had previously spoken to them about in a mocking tone behind my back.  Did that make you feel good?  Did you think I did NOT know what you were up to?!\"  Well, she turned beat red and did not say anything.   All I could think was that guy talking to me about his hat wall woke up that memory of what she pulled and I had no compunction about letting her know.   What was weird was the initial delay, the lack of follow up and then dropping a bomb out of nowhere!   Sweeney, our post-chemo selves are a puzzlement! Tex: a rehab will definitely help you with your neck.   Honestly, it might be nerve issues in your neck.  I have pinching in my neck and tonight I was reaching up to get something in the kitchen and I felt this wicked sting in my neck!  I thought I was bitten by a bug.  Then I thought the centipede that I saw in the basement and DID NOT KILL had come upstairs to bite me!   It is so weird this \"no kill\" spider thing with me.  This from a girl who stood in the middle of her bed screaming at 11 years old for my father because there was a spider in the corner of my room!   He came running up the stairs and, although he killed the spider, he did remind me I had to stop my spider nonsense and that they won't bother me if I don't bother them!   Well, he must be proud of me now!   Sptmm: you know you are in a funk?  Because bc is an all-encompassing, never-ending miserable battle from the depths of hell!!!!!!!!  Seriously, you were trucking along before you were dragged back into the surgery mix.    I am not even joking when I tell you I am so looking forward to this last surgery so I can get back to a work life before I am dx'd with mets!  I am not joking....I feel so under the gun, like I have such limited time to do something productive and have some good times before this stuff comes knocking again.   You know I am positive by nature but I am also a realist. I have to share with you all some weird stuff, aside from all the physiological business, that I have found since chemo ended.  First, I lose my train of thought a lot and I find myself going \"oh yeah, I have to do that\" and it could be even moments from when I have to do it.   Now I have all the smart phones and calendards etc... it is just weird.  I also forget I don't have cash on me.  I am a cash carrier.  I always have the debit and credit cards but I prefer cash and like I found myself having to use my cards to pay like for really small purchases because I just did not remember to bring cash, get some out of the safe etc... .  It is the weirdest thing.   As a matter of fact, when I went to the dermatologist I, again, forgot to carry cash and the parking lot there does not take cards (because they might have to file taxes on that money!) so I actually paid with change I had in my console!  It is just really weird, these little things I am finding so odd.     And the beat goes on, right?! Oh, warriors, I wish you all a lovely weekend.   Sweeney - I hope you have a lovely, trouble-free time in Toronto and that CNN captures footage of you chasing Rachel, trying to get her attention, through that sea of pink!",

Tex: I believe in the power of prayer and I also believe in the power of stupidity.  I think everyone's god was present when modern medicine was evolving.  There is a back story and, quickly, I have known him for 6 years and notice a trend of trying to avoid responsibility.  I *think* he might have made up this cancer story because he was trying to avoid something or looking for pity.  There is some \"psycho\" word for that type of behavior.  The story did not help him, largely because I think he was lying, and now he continues to use the \"c\" card whenever he can.   He will use it with me soon enough to tell me that the power of prayer miraculously took away his fake disease. What can I say?  People are troubled.  It is a messed up world.  I am sure you have very few questions as to why his \"proposals\" have been avoided!   I was never even in a relationship with him.  This is convolusion at it's finest.  All I can say is we all seem to have benefited from modern medicine and for this, I am very grateful.",

Good to hear from you, Gingerbrew.  Glad you are doing well. Omaz: has your daughter melted?! School in AZ in early August?! Please tell me it is air conditioned...or I will immediately have another flash! Rachel: how is spinning going? I agree..this summer flew by. A few weddings, a few parties, a few amusement parks, a few concerts and it is GONE. Unbelievable...this was a very fast one. I hate to admit that I am a bit afraid to go to the 9/11 memorial this year. I just have been through so much with this cancer crap this past 1 ½ years that I can't imagine being in the throws of a terrorist attack and then having to regroup mentally, physically and emotionally from all of this. I am so deeply ambivalent. If I did not battle bc these past number of months, I would be ready to go. I want to see the reflection pools, to see my boyfriend's name on the memorial and to go with my very good friend who lives in lower Manhattan and who is actually alive because he was running late for work. I kind of want to go but I just don't know what I will do. In the end, I agree with you that I will never forget where I was. 9/11 was to our generation what JFK-is-dead was to our parent's generation. It drudges up a lot of memories...a lot. Sweeney: I notice lately my temper is a bit shorter. Mind you, I am not long on patience anyway. It is so hard to play \"pin the tail on the cause\" because all of these things are the result of a confluence of events like for you it might be work/family stress and you are just feeling it more. I think tamox heightens the experience of extreme emotions. I also don't have my cycle but I am sure if I did, it would be a much worse exorcism than it used to be! I will never forget my last fiancé, if we were having a *discussion,* would walk over to the calendar and say \"babe, is it that time again?\" and would drag his finger along the dates!!!!!!! That, my friend, was tantamount to disaster!!!! I would have \"extra\" headaches after those little episodes!!! After all, you want to aggravate me so therefore there is no robbery in fair exchange!!! He he he! Oh...today at the eye doctor the optician was wicked ADD and I was really losing my patience there! I was sooo hoping she would get another customer and all she had to find out about was my bc and she never shut up again about how she knows 14,000 people who have had it blah, blah, blah.... I was about to put a pencil through my temple! I don't know if it is tamox or just life?! It is rainy and cold here, like the Fall...kind of nice. Well, I hope everyone is doing well and had nice, long weekends. Good times, girls, good times! Remember where we all were last year at this time?! Gross!",

Oh well, just like bc, this is another never-ending negative force I must deal with for the rest of my life. Sptmm: I was thinking of you this weekend. I am just so self-absorbed with this 9-11 stuff and I actually did a tune-up on a sports car that I have today just to keep my mind busy! I am so glad you are feeling well, though. No surgery is ever easy and as much as we think we are going to bounce right back, it never really works out that way. I laude you, however, for walking a mile to the pizza place! That is a great way to work off some pizza! Good thinking. I hope you do well this week and feel a bit better each day. The scarring: I was not too happy to find out she will be cutting both sides. It healed so well on the side where the TE still is that you could not even tell I was ever cut. It will be another year before that goes away. We are going to be all scarred up for a while, Deb...glad it is getting cold again on that note!!!!!!! I did keep busy today, though. I try not to think about all that carnage. I could not stop myself from going to my 9-11 memorabilia, however, and found an email from a friend of mine at Lehman that said he was appalled to look out the window and literally \"see\" people running, on foot, up the West Side Highway. I also found releases from my firm telling us the next steps to take and an actual communication from the NYSE detailing the unprecedented shut down. I did not go through all of it...too upsetting.

Texas: Yeah, I really don't like to talk about when I am not well but, to be honest, when I saw Whitney post, and because I have been getting fed up with this bunch of symptoms that are becoming the equivalent of a physiological flash mob, I had to talk.  In this past month, and moreso in these past 2 weeks, my body is sending me a lot of messages.  The anal bleeding, blood coming out of my nose, my nose hurts even to touch it, I am constantly having cotton mouth even though all I drink is water, I am getting charlie horses every night just about and last night I had 3, pains in the top of my head that wake me up, a rash on both arms that makes me want to take a knife and cut skin off and my lips have been chapped, sorely chapped for months and months.  Add to that a peculiar cough and tired eyes, I can't help but wonder what the heck is going on with my body.  I never had allergies in my life either.   I guess when I read Whitney's post I felt comfortable discussing my own troubled plight.  I would not even mind but after going through all this crap, I would like to get back to a normal state but I think what I have to do is give up what I knew \"normal\" to be and become more accepting of this \"perpetually sick\" new norm.   What confuses me is how there are no in-between docs from the onc, who I have found to be completely dismissive right after chemo ended, to the GP who does their best but it just seems very odd that there is not a \"clean-up\" doctor after chemo who can help us sort it out and perhaps help someone like me get these warning signals into a trending box.   To be honest, I am scared \"s\" less that these are warnings and no one is listening.   Sorry to unload, Tex...I know you know all too well what it is like to going round robbin in the medical industrial complex!   BTW, get on them tomorrow about those scans.  I tell you, I was their freakin' BILL PRINTING machine would break down as much as their follow-ups do.   I am glad you focused on school today.  Keep me posted as to what happens.

(can't remember exactly...has been like 20 years!) to move to the next level.  I kind of feel like Zelda in this post-bc/chemo \"Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome\" I am in with this troubled container I call a body and lack of answers. I feel like I have to keep cutting down all this brush to get to some answers.   I feel so dehydrated, and I drink 100+ ozs of water daily and the only other thing I drink is 2 cups of coffee (cream only), I wish I had an IV next to my bed!  On a much lighter note, the tv continues to take my mind off of all of this stuff and \"Dancing with the (NON!) Stars\" started tonight and Nancy Grace and Chaz Bono were 2 dancers gathering a lot of attention in the weeks leading up to the season premiere.  They both did pretty well and Chaz Bono was really, really good!  It is enjoyable, fluff television for me!  Sweet dreams to everyone!  ",

I was just watching Nightline and there is a new field in cancer studies called \"Cardioncology\" which studies the ramifications of your heart going forward after having lung and breast cancer. Apparently those of us that had left side bc are more prone to heart problems if we had a chemo, like adriamyacin, which is all but guaranteed to cause heart problems. They said anyone who has had bc and left side in particular, should see a cardio oncologist once per year to have a heart stress test and some other test to measure if the heart is showing signs of problems. This is sooo exciting! Finally, someone that is trying to HELP US stay alive after chemo! We have all talked about concerns for our heart after chemo and who watches over us and how do we know when to get more scans and tests etc... and out of the mouth of Diane Sawyer fell this wonderful piece of information! The cardio oncologist they interviewed said get off the carbs, onto the protein but I don't know what the hell they expect us to do when our animal food sources are poisoned. I think I want the NASA pill soon! I could never raise my own animals for food either....I would have a huge farm and be starving! There is hardly anything that is comparable to animal protein, however, so I will just pipe down and realize I am not meant to be here forever so eat an animal and save your heart!! It is scary! The reason they ran this story, btw, is because of Senator Kennedy's niece that died of heart attack while working out this past week.  Apparently she had lung cancer and the chemo she was treated with, some 10 years ago, was known to damage the heart.  TereseA: take all the advice and join the thread for your group so you have people you can identify with. I wish you the best and we are all fine examples of life beyond chemo! Come back anytime. Texas: sure, send me your net flix ID. I got rid of the cable company for the same reason. Getting these bills that just keep going up....awful. About scans after, no one has any planned, docs don't speak of them and basically, after chemo, it is sort of like hope-for-the-best or, if you feel sick, we will scan you. It is pathetic after all these years this is all they have got? They rely on that old dog, radiation, for like 50 years now. We all know the definition of insanity so I don't know why they keep doing the same things expecting different results? It is a shame that our post-chemo life is basically hope you don't get sick. It is a real travesty. I don't want to be aggravated with a bunch of unnecessary tests and scans either but it would be nice if you received a MAP at the end of chemo listing even bloodwork etc... that should be done at certain intervals but there is nothing. The entire experience is the antithesis of preemptive. They treat, they can't cure and no one plays clean up after chemo but alas we have our CARDIO ONCOLOGISTS now!!! I will go to MSK if I have to, once a year, if Yale does not have this practice yet. Sometimes I watch ABC at 6:30 at night because Diane Sawyer's voice is so mellifluous and soothing! Tonight there was the added bonus of good news for all of us bc girls! All I know is that bottled water news was spooky! I kind of knew that on some level but why I was not paying more attention to it evades me. It is just plain old sad! The dermatologist thinks I have poison oak/ivy/sumac and prescribed some \"stuff!\" She said as for my lips and nose, really not sure. She gave me something else for my lips and reminded me that after chemo, allergies to most anything can happen. Now tomorrow, while the contractors are here, I will be washing all of my sheets and clothes I have worn since this started! Good times...!",

I could not believe when the other night I was walking into a store and there were some wannabe vamps that were absolutely awestruck by my bulbs of blood (thanks JP drain) that had now sneaked out from under my coat! Of course, because they are kids they have no idea what these things are about and, because they think they are vampires, I now fell into the \"meal\" category! It was like such a comedy. Them following me, lurking behind like I did not notice them, and one of them, the girl, was trying to take PHOTOS with her phone of my drains! They did not alarm me so much as I just wanted them to go away. I used the opportunity, when the head vampire got close enough, I told him how sad it is that I spent so much of my life partying and now I am relegating to peeing blood out into these little drains! Funny how they lost interest when they thought there was urine involved! Goodbye vampires! Also, thanks to my Derek Jeter shirt that was long and baggy enough they could not tell from where these drains had come! All kidding aside, between the drains and the scarring and the overall discomfort, the last thing I want is anything complicating my little trips to the store. I also sleep like a mummy! Not joking...I am so afraid of problems with these drains that I get into bed, and I have pillows around both sides of me so I don't move, put my arms up on the pillows surrounding me, watch some tv until I doze off and I wake IN THE EXACT same position! Yes, like a mummy! Omaz: I hope you enjoy your nice, fall day in AZ. It reminds me that I hope one day to get all this madness behind me and go mountain biking again. It is just nice to get out but I feel like this whole situation has made me such a \"girl\" in that I am like \u2018wow...what if I flip over the handlebars now? Might mean 3 days in the hospital whereas before it would have meant a band aid and get back on and ride!' All I could think when you said a nice fall day in AZ was riding. As for power, the other northeasterners must just be busy because I am only pretty sure the preponderance of the east coast is all lit up! Have a nice weekend, all-",

In any case, and lucky for you all, I remembered!  You know how I said my nose was hurting, so much that I could not even touch it, blood was coming out, my lips were cracked so painfully that nothing was helping even Protopic?  I also had another issue at that time of hard bumps forming on and around my thumb and index finger, on the top of my hand, on the right side but I just did not share that part.  I wanted to scratch them and my skin right off my hand.  Well, right after that TE that had been in my body, deflated, for some 16 months was removed, ALL of those things went away almost instantly.  I was having an ALLERGIC REACTION to the TE.   I could not believe that my nose, lips, hand all cleared up within like 36 hours of getting home from the hospital.  I am so grateful as well because my nose hurt so much, there was one night I actually teared up from it...that is how much it hurt.   All I could think, of course, is I had nose cancer or throat cancer or whatever.  What else could I possibly think with those weird symptoms and within 1/4 inch of each other, physically?   I will never know why that TE caused my lips, nose and hand reaction but that had to be the culprit because my nose does not hurt one bit anymore and my lips are fine.  It feels so great to know those awful, awful problems were not indicative of mets but rather a reaction to that damn TE.  Again, and just in case I did not say it today, I am so glad I found an excellent PS that cares enough to be innovative and who does the best she can for us poor bc victims.   I am so lucky to have found her. Omaz: I saw the Diane Sawyer interview with Gabby Giffords last night.  It was very emotional.  I am not discussing this with you as her shooting affected the entire nation but you being in AZ just makes me want to discuss it with you more than anyone else.   I hope to God she fully recovers.   That poor woman, what an awful turn of events for what seems to be a very kind hearted soul.     Well, ladies, time for the evening news!  The topics tonight: CT is broke, our unemployment is probably 15%, CT Light and Power took nearly 3 weeks to restore power after our Fall snowstorm simply because it would have cost them too much in overtime and I am sure there are several shootings as Hartford, New Haven and Bridgeport which collectively are starting to make the likes of Baghdad and Libya look safe!  Oh, and then there was a bank hold-up done at the drive through of a B of A today!!!!!!!   I cannot believe they had actually held up the bank through the drive-through!      ",

Ginger: speaking of war and our veterans and what they gave, I was so, so happy for JR Martinez!  I am so happy he won!  I was also very impressed with Rob Kardashian.  He seems like such a nice, respectful, pleasant young man.  I also like Ricki Lake.  I think it was a good show this year.  Your dgd must be adorable dancing to the music!  Isn't it amazing how they connect to music right away?  So cute. Omaz:  HLN is now reporting that drinking more coffee reduces our risk of endometrial cancer, so says a recent study so DRINK UP!!!   That was a great article and what interesting findings. 100% can't be argued with.  That is outrageous.   I don't know what the answers are.  I think I am moving to Canada with Sweeney and Rachel!  I am serious, I want less medical/job drama and more peace of mind!  As soon as you make any sort of decent money in this country you are paying 42% in taxes.   I will gladly go to 50% and know I have healthcare!  Scary...I was just watching footage of protestors in Egypt and it looked a bit like the \"Occupy Wall St\" movement where they police are going crazy with tear gas.  It is pretty sad that I just thought footage from Egypt, as my tv is on mute, was the US.     Good day, all- ",

Omaz: you really need some rocks, however.  Just get one of those jetted foot baths and find smooth, rounded rocks, like spa rocks, to put in the base of the foot bath.  Some foot baths have built-in roller-type of things to massage your feet which you manually roll your feet against.   I think a foot bath or, in this case, acupuncture might be a good idea?  I really think it is just about reorienting or disorienting and reorienting your nerves.     This morning I got up at 8 and flew out of bed to get my leather medical binder.  Something is on my mind about recent blood work.  I took it all apart and am still looking but something is bothering me.  In any case, at the end of my intake from my onc it says \"she is young and premenopausal and if she remains premenopausal after chemotherapy, I would consider the addition of ovarian suppression as well.\"  Is this where an AI would come in?  Is this why you might switch to an AI as it suppresses the ovaries?  Just wondering.   I never see my onc at appts since chemo so I turn to you all with questions! I received a juicer for Xmas (early gift) and am so happy to have it!  I love it.  It really makes life easy.  You get tons of nutrients quick.   Tex: I try to be nice but when I *try* it almost always comes across as condescension.   There is nothing more frustrating than being told \"this is the way it is\" when you know that the entire big ball of shit is just that.  They are shanghaiing Kel, and everyone else in this country, with medical costs and aggravation.  More to this point, it is very hard to be sweet when you already know you are right, they are wrong, you are being wrongly accused, told to pay for it and your chain is totally getting yanked.    As for the landlord that owes you, can't you take them to small claims and ask for a deadline?  There has to be a statute of limitations and don't forget, *they* know what that is.  Take them to small claims.  You can take anyone, for any reason to small claims.  DO IT.  Embarrass them, get a judgment, get a definitive repayment schedule.  That is HOW it ends up on their credit.  You need a judgment.  Go get one....everyone else does.  That is how you can demand your funds and get a timeline.  When someone owes you, you have control...exercise it!   When the water gets cold, I open the drain, let some out and add some more hot water!  Lady: that is great news!  I am very happy for you.  I also know how you feel...onc, ps, dermatologist, dentist, MRI... I can't stand going to doctors anymore.  I, too, broke a tooth.   $3K for an implant...thanks chemo!

Are any of you familiar with a small grocery store chain called \"Aldi?\" About 4 or 5 years ago they started appearing in CT.  I really had no clue about them until I finally went into one this year.   In any case, and speaking to thr RBGH point, I was in there a few days ago and their milk, made by \"Friendly Farms (love the name!),\" is synthetic hormone-free.   I got to looking around at their dairy products as a result.  Not only is their milk over 30% less expensive than the larger grocery stores, if what they advertise is valid, it is also better for us.   Thought I would pass that information along! I know you all will be green with envy but I am off to do the very exciting cleaning of the oven!!!!   Boo hiss!",

Rachel: glad you had a good weekend!  I fully understand your tired business.  I am so wiped out and I am not working at all. I can't imagine what return to work was like.  What did the insurance say?  Did they feel the tiredness was just age, returning to work and/or still part of recovering?   I really think this has left me in such a strange place...I sure hope my energy builds upon return to the workforce.  Lady: you look terribly spirited in your avatar!   I agree with Rachel on the boas!  Glad you are doing so well. I am tired, another hot-flash filled, 4 hour sleep night.   I am also trying to get so much stuff done because I know I am going to be completely unable to do much of anything for a while after surgery.   I feel better going into this surgery as I feel more prepared and have a better understanding of what I might expect this time.  I always put up my Christmas tree early but this year I think it is going to go up BEFORE Halloween because I don't think I am really even going to be able to lift my arms much for a while and PT is in my future after surgery also.  Oh well...I love my Christmas tree and those wonderful, holiday smelling logs for the fireplace....it is all so cozy!  Good night, all",

      "Content": "Oct 27, 2011 05:13AM - edited Oct 27, 2011 05:16AM by 1WonderWoman Good day warriors! Do you all think that the time we are under anesthesia can be considered \"sleep\" time?!  Reason being is did not get to sleep until after 4 and woke up at noon!  This, of course, means unless I get knocked out by a flying object, I probably won't get any sleep at all tonight L   Well, at least I will have a 5 hour nap at the hospital! Sweeney: TRAVELIN' Jones!   Thanks for stopping by, globe trotter!   That is an awful story about your mind and the tricks of bump-findings.  I would teach your mind a good lesson when you get home and get loaded!!!!!!!!   The trick will be on your devilish mind at that point!   Seriously, though, it is very scary to be so far away and think you might be having a problem.   I feel for you.   At the risk of sounding like elitest swine, after all this bc crap, I will NEVER travel to a 3rd world country again.  After being so sick, and then that infection and knocking on death's door in the hospital after my body stopped responding to antibiotics, I can't even imagine being in a place where I could not get adequate medical attention.   In the main cities, however, I know where you are you can get some medical attention, should you need it.   My point is I would not go on safari at this point! Here's to hoping your trip winds up and you are healthy, happy and back home in the Tundra soon! BTW, on *junk tv,* I watch \"Jersey Shore\" and \"Dancing With the Stars!\"   Pre-bc  I would never watch this kind of stuff and here I am, can just about set my watch to these shows!   As for \"Beavis and Butthead,\" and for all you *closet fans (he he he!), those little jokers are back on TONIGHT!   Now, I fully admit, that was something I watched all my life and will own that! Sptmm: I do remember back in March when that started.  I am sure they are just being cautious and don't really expect to find anything but what a procedure to go through.    I think, however, the \"plug\" process the Ginger and Whitney describe seems worse.  I think I might elect the vacumm/ablation to that plug business!!!!!  Of course, when it comes right down to it, we never have choices...only directives and resistance if we don't want to move in that direction!   After this surgery I hope I am done with scanville for a while!   Be sure to let us know when you get your results but I am sure it is just the tamox SE.   Yeah, I am a little worried about going on AIs but if it is the better solution health-wise, and now that I am not cycling, I will take it!   Ginger: after all the shit we go through, any doctor that is ruthless enough, and under the auspices of \"time-cutting\" directives, to do that to you should be approached in a courtroom.   It is NOT slander when it is true.  This person knows to come after you, polygraphs included, would be like asking his malpractice insurance to go up.    BTW, the definition of slander is \"a malicious, false, and defamatory statement or report.\"  He was malicious in encouraging you to go without anesthesia, purposely gave you false information, to no doubt save time, as human animals are known to act particularly egregious when the outcome is connected to either time or money and finally your report is not false and therefore does not seek to arbitrarily defame.  On that note, you should invite him to court!   I would like to see him in court explaining how he put you through a breast cancer patient through tremendous pain and upset and his reasons were...?  Does he have breasts?  Does he know what that would feel like?  Wherria: thank you so much.  I need special thoughts and prayers!  More good vibes, the better!   I am really so happy to have a female PS as all the ladies I have met in the bc center at Yale have good things to say about her and, to be honest, I just feel a woman knows better what we are going through.  For this reason I am so happy to have found her. As for your TIAA-CREF retirement account, if you are no longer working for them in any way, you are eligible to roll that to an IRA.   This is for everyone BTW: IRAs are NOT meant to have CDs sitting in them at the local banks.  If you really want to MAXIMIZE your dollars, when your CDs come up, ROLL those accounts, while liquid to a BROKERAGE IRA.    There are tons of brokerage houses and I personally like Schwab.   Once you get your funds in a liquid form in a brokerage account, you can then buy the very lucrative STOCKS in those IRAs and grow your money while you are all young enough (below 80 y/o!) to see it experience growth under the gyrations of our healthy market.  We have the best markets (stocks, bonds, reits, CMOs -no, they are not the devil's fodder(!)-, mutual funds, annuities, variable annuities and the like) there is ZERO reason to sit in a very non-productive bank CD.   The interest is less than paltry and the fact that you will have to pay taxes on these funds down the road, do not seek ridiculous safety because in pursuing safety, you are actually incapacitating yourself financially down the road. So, Wherria, God willing I make it out of this surgery but, should I not, you now know what to do!  I will, however, be in touch with you through either PM or phone to let you know what additional steps to take on investing those funds.   I am more than happy to help anyone.  I am no longer licensed in the industry therefore I can freely tell you all whatever I know and whatever I feel you need to know!  11 years I lived and breathed it so I can let you all in on a few secrets!  Now get those brokerage IRAs open and let's get rollin'! On the African music, I love it!  My new phone also has a ringtone that is a drum rhythm and it sounds very much in that vein.  I like it! Go Rangers, indeed!   When the Yankees go down early, I am still a baseball fan! Ckptry: as you know, and because you are a nurse, allergies can come on at any time and I noticed since chemo that I am sneezing and my general balance seems to have been upset but then I start singing that song again, \"Born to be Alive,\" and I am reminded that chemo is not a bane but a savior and I stop cursing it!!!   I hope everything is fine at your appointment today and your results help you find a solution that does not make you jittery and that which helps you breath easily.  As for you catching up to Aidan, what a dubious marathon for you two to be involved in!  My heart goes out to both of you. My new avatar: I took the photo so close so you all could actually see my witchy face!  It appears I was on top of the camera, however!  In any case, off to do Zumba and laundry!   Good times!  I am so berserk about having everything wicked clean and all my bedding cleaned etc.. before surgery...it is almost OCD! So, and just in case I don't make it out of surgery ...!, you all have your homework: open IRAs at Schwab, roll non-productive IRAs into that new IRA, and go forth and prosper! Oh yeah...and watch \"Beavis and Butthead\" also!  I think in tonight's episode, in their neverending search for girls, they are going to try to become vampires!  They find a guy who looks like a vampire but he is actually homeless and has Hep C.  They, of course, get Hep C trying to get some vampire fluids from him so they can become vamps.  I guess they sit at home on the couch, getting so sick from Hep C but they think they are becoming vampires instead!!   The last preview clip I saw showed them barely able to walk out of the house/crawling out to attack \"chicks\" with their newfound vampire status!!!   It is a cartoon....put on your kid glasses and enjoy!",

I have no idea what happened in that hospital but I have come home with such a \"fruit\" almost addiction, I am cutting up pineapples like I own a Benihana's!   I am fully stocked with grapes, strawberries, cantaloupe, pineapple, honey dew, oranges, pears and am eat all of my yummy fruits with cottage cheese.   I am loving this fruit and these end -of-season red grapes are so delicious!   I can't get enough.  I am actually a green grape eater normally except when I was growing up our neighbor was from Sicily and her husband, of course, had to put up grape vines.  Those were dark blue treats from heaven!   They were consummate growers of yummy grapes!  She would invite me over for \"Sherbet cones\" in the summer and we would sit on the swing in the garden and swing and chat...it was grand!   They were the neighborhood grandparents to all the kids but I was their favorite.   There were times when they would not let anyone but me onto the property because I was the only one that always behaved!  I know you all find that hard to believe!   In any case, these grapes that I am getting locally lately are reminiscent of those grapes they used to grow.  In long, I am loving these fruits!! Rachel: I hope you have a lovely \"adults only\" night out tomorrow night!  I really do.  I so think you need this.   You need a little break every now and again and that life/work balance that you speak of is very, very important but so hard to maintain.   Cut to one cell phone and assign a particular ringtone to the baby sitter.  In this way, the only calls you will take are from the baby sitter if they have been assigned their own ring.  This promises a night free of all interruptions.  In any case, I hope you have a nice, pleasant time. Well, I am all filled with aches and pains and am ready to go to bed.  I hope you all have a nice night.  Ugh....I just realized I have to get up in 5 hours for the oil delivery!   Also the poor girl from the VNA who has no power for over a week is coming at 8 so she can blow dry her hair!  That poor girl, she lives only a few miles from me and has no power.    She said the other day how she would love to be able to blow dry her hair so I told her she was more than welcome.  It got me thinking, Connecticut has lost power and had these long power outages where over a million customers are out of service.  I was thinking tonight about how we can, on a town-by-town basis, have an emergency plan to make some meals for those without power.  Sort of like those with power in the town will drop off meals to those who don't have power at 2 locations and 2 separate times per day etc.... I just wish I could do more.   I don't lose power and I feel pretty bad that someone only 1 mile away has no power and I would gladly allow people to take a shower, have a meal and get warm, even in my debilitated, post-surgical state.   I am going to mull this over and see what I can come up with.  If 20 people could make 2 meals and show up at the library at 3PM that is 40 meals that could be handed out to those who have no power.  I think in this day, with all our electronic connectivity, we should be able to do a little more to help our neighbors. Goodnight, all-",

Funny *s*!!!   I better stop....I will scare ladyinbama away from mall walking! Yeah, ballroom dancing...I always wanted to....I also want to learn tenor sax.  Just some stuff i want to do.  I think as I head into the years where hip gyrating in the nightclubs has been relegated to the dust bin of history, and as it should, and where dancing so as not to break a hip is the new goal, it might be time to learn something less rambunctious!  Here is to us learning a proper waltz! Lady: when you are ready, a great vaca/pick-me-up for any woman but, in particular, American woman of a certain age (over 45ish) is Sicily!   Italian men, as we all know are wildly amorous!  I don't even think \"wildly amorous\" even gives proper justice!  In any case, in Sicily there is a love of \"older\" American women and even if you are not looking for \"that,\"  I once knew a woman who would just go  back and revel in that attention!  She loved it...65, looked great, fought gravity with a few trips to the nip and she found those trips to Sicily to be particularly enthralling!   Maybe you owe yourself a little jaunt after the holidays!  Did I tell you all about when I was on a 1st with *this* Italian guy but, when I was flirting with the slightly post-St. Pat's Day Irish leftover visiting Manhattan!  In any case, I dumped that guy I was dating but not quickly enough because I so wanted to race off with that (rather principled) Dublin man but the Dublin man was upset with me for basically \"jilting\" the guy I was with, while he was still there!!!! Principled men...the bane of my existence!!! In any case, about the Irish boys---always hysterical (with the pint!), strong wit, good looking and, here goes a TMI, but I have fallen victim to laughing my pants off on more than one occasion!!  So, my point is, go to Sicily, go to Ireland, enjoy the boys and come home and tell us all about it, Lady....HAVE SOME FUN!  If my boobs are all fixed up, I just might join you!   I am going to need a serious MAN holiday next year and to avoid clingers/complications, I will be heading across the pond! Keep smiling, girls!",

      "Content": "Nov 15, 2011 12:17PM 1WonderWoman wrote: Good day, warriors- Lady: good luck tomorrow. Hope all goes well. Omaz: Sorry--I logged right off yesterday!   What I meant by 2-3's is if you had a pair of 3 lb hand weights already, you can naturally put the 2-3 pounders in 1 hand and the single 6 in the other to achieve balance! Also that link I sent you for Amazon for those bars where you can add and subtract weight is great. Reason being, of course, if you are working your biceps, you should also be working your triceps. Of course, ideally you are working tri's and bi's with the same weight but that is not always the case. For this reason, those \"make your own\" dumb bells are great because you can take a little on and off as needed. I am going to give you a few references from our \"lifting book,\" as follows: Pages 322-323 gets you right through the \"universal circuit\" at any gym. This teaches you how to use all the machines and the pages that proceed that diagram show each machine in detail. On page 206, the middle exercise, if done off of an aerobic step is probably one of the best things you can do for your BUTT! It is listed, under the title of the exercise as a secondary muscle worked but if you add the aerobic step=good stuff! On page 304, one of the best tricep exercises ever. You can do it with the EZ bar link I sent you from Amazon and it can be done either on a weight bench (my preference with my knees pulled to my chest) or on the floor lying on your back. It can be done with dumbbells but you don't get the same uniformity. On triceps, a comfortable exercise is on pg. 302 and it is a favorite of women. If you sit on the edge of a weight bench, you can really isolate the tricep muscle. Pages 286-top of 288 all good for thighs and butt and the difference you will notice is in how their feet are positioned. You can do these just by resting dumbbells on your shoulders. The advantage here is if you put 10 lb plates under your heels. This is really works inner thigh/buttock areas that are hard to reach. Whenever looking up an exercise in \"our book!\" always pay close attention to the position of their feet. It is a key feature. I hope you are enjoying the book. It takes a lifetime to get through but you are learning, with every page, how to build a better infrastructure for yourself. After the quite necessary, but deleterious, chemo, we have to be concerned with building up a good jacket for our bones. Tex: good to hear from you! Glad the PT is working.  I will check the article out later.  Check your PM the next time you log on in January! BTW, happy holidays!! Hope school is going well and glad you are busy, moving on with your life. Good for you. My surgery is done, drains are out and I am roughly 70% done. The left side came out beautiful, she \"built\" my new breast over my breast muscle so I can definitely still lift and I do have one more surgery, which will most likely take place sometime in January, that should complete this process. She is a wonderful PS, I am so glad I found her and she does really nice work. No implants, nothing...just using existing body fat and rebuilding breasts, no skin cutting, no flap that look like eyes over my breasts, just the same old scar there was after bmx and it is actually more in line with my under crease of my breast. Good stuff, Tex, good stuff! I could not be happier and am very happy for no implants. When do you find out if you made the nursing program? Have you taken the tests already? Best of luck with that and keep me posted! Well, I have another doctor's appointment today but I am achy, tired, and sore and don't feel like doing anything! Oh well....alas I must go! Good day, girls-",

Things to be grateful for this holiday week! Lady: I will be sending the most positive vibes your way and I hope you, just like the rest of us, are polishing up your fake smile, getting prepared for the \"smile til' it hurts\" family holiday! I really think they should be called \"hellidays!!!\" Calamtykel: you know, some friends and family ask me why I did not leave the Northeast, leave the country and go living abroad etc... For me, and for just the reasons you mention about Amish women, their place in society, the brainwashing etc... my life is \"just\" fine in the Northeast part of the US. There are backwoods travesties that are rather commonplace for those embroiled in that experience all over this country. It is a shame but there is only so much one person can do and only so much one person can see. I am no shrinking violet (I know I needed to point that out!) and I would never be the person standing by while someone was the victim of violence etc... For these reasons I stay in the civilized Northeast where my capacity to respond to such situations is NOT tested! I am very glad you went to the Japanese buffet! Geesh, you only live once and you deserve treats! You know, my cat was feral and she was living along the highway when I trapped and adopted her! Now she is a love but because she is now indoor (does not even try to get out) I make sure she gets daily exercise and her vet and I like her weight to be kept around 11 lbs which is where she is. IN any case, Sunday is \"Kitty treat day\" where I give her some of those crunchy cat treats. Of course, because she only gets them on Sunday they are truly a treat. Everyone, pets included, NEED treats be it a massage, pedicure, a trip to the Japanese buffet or a handful of treats on Sunday, ENJOY! You work hard and you do all the right things so you deserve it, woman! Texas: first of all, I would take your freakin' change, march right  into the gas station and GET YOUR GAS. Don't play around with that stupid Walmart bank and you have NOTHING to be ashamed and if anyone gives you any lip I would LOUDLY announce that the oil companies should be embarrassed to be charging us all this money for gas forcing to pay with change. Don't let anybody make you feel like that. In fact, I would purposely save up my change and go and get gas and instead of forking over dollars or swiping, make them work for your money by counting out your change. Not only that, banks are supposed to just exchange your change anyway without talk of some stupid machine like their stupid asses were dumbstruck and they can't count. This economy is disgusting and I don't care where you stand politically, the Republicans fight to do everything to save the top 5% money and if they get their agenda accomplished, then the mastresses and masters of the universe , the top 5%, will create jobs. Meanwhile Obama has to try to finesse politically so they will NOT keep the populace hostage by not creating jobs but they won't budge until they get all their cuts. You know what? It sucks and it is thanks to one President in particular that corporate America runs our country and it was not the Bush's nor Clinton. So don't you ever feel embarrassed because you are the victim of political tricks and I would march right in with my hands full of change because to feel embarrassed is to feel that you are inadequate in some way or are not doing all you can to survive when the bottom line is there exists a political stalemate that is screwing the entire country. You are doing all you can but are a victim of government-sponsored economic sparring.  In fact, if I were you, I would make it my policy to always pay with change! PUNKS! Times are tough, kid, don't you let that get you down. Finally, I hope you had fun shell hunting at the beach! Well, I was a little busy this weekend but I have to say you all are always in my thoughts! I hope you all had a nice weekend and are feeling good. Good day, troops, and may the FORCE BE WITH YOU!",

It is also a good excuse NOT to answer your phone!!  I think I have admitted I am a little crazy with the organization stuff, right? Well today I organized the shed and even used the leaf blower to clean it out! After that I used these wire organization baskets to divide up my baseball hats, sunglasses, winter hats, gloves and music players in an armoire that is in what I call my \"depart the house\" room! It is not a mud room but rather a bedroom I have turned into my coats (both racked and in the closet!), shoe, boot, sneakers, bags, messenger bags and armoire of organization room! It is near the back door so, for this reason, it works perfectly because I really only use the back door. In any case, this VNA was here today looking at my drain holes and she said \"can I get you a band aid\" so I told her exactly where in the bathroom to go, and on what shelf and in the wicker basket were all my band aids, Neosporin, tape etc...! She remarked on how very organized the entire bathroom cabinet and closet are. I just like organization! Lady: thank you so much for your kind words. I love, love, love being here for you all. It is really important to me and I am thankful for all of you as well. There is a ying for every yang, after all! This group has meant an awful lot to me and being able to talk about those crazy SEs during chemo was so helpful, I could not even put it into words. I just hope you make it through this Thanksgiving and are stronger as a result. Remember, you get to go home, or get everyone moving toward the door, shut and lock it (!), take a nice hot shower, have a cup of tea and curl up with your little dogs and watch movies! Now that is a nice way to end Thanksgiving!  I also assign to you to embrace, hum and sing to yourself \"Three Little Birds\" also!  I think it should be our anthem to get through this holiday!  Omaz and Ginger: thank you both also for chiming in! I am grateful for all of you. Do you know how lost I would have been if someone like me had nothing to do, nothing to organize and no one to encourage through this entire mess?! I have said this before and will mention it again, as we can be so very grateful for how far modern medicine has brought us, but my friend Sandy's mom had bc in the 70's and by the time they bmx'd it was all but too late and she went home and basically died alone with her kids there. My friend remembers using the gel things (sorry...I forget the name) women put in their bras back then( to make it look like they still had breasts) in the pool as flotation devices and for games!! Of course, she and her brother were kids but, you know, there is something so poignant about her story and I just never, ever forget it. She was 17 and basically orphaned when her mom passed but shortly thereafter came into a rather large inheritance and as a kid at 18 with no money skills, she had her challenges as a result. Her story breaks my heart and so I am very grateful for you all, that we are all still here and that we, unlike women in the 70s, have each other to go through this with. Again, I must thank the very benevolent Al Gore for giving us the internet!!!!! Seriously, though, can you imagine what this would have been like without the internet? Well, I have also admitted I like DWTS and tonight is the finale! If any are following, isn't Martinez something else? That poor guy, what he went through and what a lovely person he is. It is nice entertainment and it is also nice that it does not involve a gurney! I get so tired of the likes of CBS which should be called the \"gurney network!\" I know they have \"Big Bang\" and \"2 ½ Men\" but I am pretty sure those are on a short list of non-gurney shows on CBS! In any case, happy trails to you all!",

Of course, I am up all night with hot flashes.  Now I don't get to sleep until 5AM.  The only solution is to go on 20mg of an antidepressant.   Great.  In any case, while I was sitting in my back yard at 3:30AM, staring at the stars and thinking about this cancer crap, I started to think about how cancer loves sugar.  In any case, came in and hopped on my computer and wanted to share these 2 links with you that have really, really good info and perhaps even some reminders. I believe I am forgetting some things, important things, about my post-bc health.  In any case, here are the links: www.mnwelldir.org/docs/nutrition/diet.htm www.mnwelldir.org/docs/nutrition/sugar.htm Finally, has anyone switched to macrobiotic diet?  I don't believe diet causes cancer.  Bottom line is I think it is stress but once you have it, it might be time to look at a few changes.

I have a montage of his pictures in a hallway in my home and I just stopped to talk to his pic a little while ago!  It seems like he was just here yesterday.  I miss him very much.  He was a very good man. Meningitis...ugh.   Yes, I do hope it is viral also.  Tex, please let us know as soon as you can.  That really makes me nervous.  They are so young but their youth is also strength in a situation like this.  I sure hope you get the best news possible.  Meningitis is, sadly, making a come back.  I have heard of cases here in CT and we have not had any talk of that in these parts for years and year until recently, I would say the past 2 years or so.  I will be sending positive vibes for sure. Ginger: did you have a nice holiday?  I sure hope so.  I follow JR Martinez on Twitter and he is just such a nice man.  He has tweeted pics of him with the trophy and I guess a friend or someone in his family made a mirror ball made of cupcakes for him!  It looked great!   Night, girls...tired, tired, tired!  ",

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2012 06:25AM - edited Feb 12, 2012 06:30AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, my lovely warriors!   Omaz: One night my friend and I left NYC around 1AM. We were heading back to his house in New Rochelle when he decided to get off I95 in the Bronx so he could get something at a convenience store! I was a little too tipsy to complain but sure enough, when we were en route this dubiously located convenience store, a \"person\" landed in the street about 100 feet in front of our car. They had jumped out the window of a blighted building. As the story unfolded, apparently this person was an IV drug user that apparently upset a dealer and they gave this person battery acid instead of their drug or something to that effect. I guess the pain caused that person to take their life. More to this point, I honestly feel like chemo is a controlled battery acid and it really resets our system entirely sans the pain. It is like a clean start and I think whatever aversions you now have, it is really because you have a new system, albeit achieved by dubious means! Anything is possible now and don't forget, cancer loves sugar and, as you know, bread, potatoes, pasta, cereal etc... all sugar in our bodies. I seriously think the government serving up boat loads of sugar post-WWII so as to feed a growing population was tantamount to the proliferation of cancer. In long, eat the poison animals, that is better for us! Seriously, I just think cancer means very little carb consumption. I even went back to an old dessert that I would have when limiting carbs which is ricotta based. It is so funny that your dd is not prepared to drive right away. We were hell-bent on getting that driver's license at 16 (my brothers and sister) and could not wait to get out on the road. The antithesis of this, however, is my best friend's son who, at almost 17, still does not want to get his license. He has a few friends that don't want their license either. At 17, my boyfriend Ed and his friend John, who just came into his trust fund, and I went to Manhattan in a John's mother's new car, with a cooler and a plan to have some fun!! We had a blast the whole trip! I called my father from a pay phone in NYC and told him I was staying at a friend's house! Of course he probably did not believe me! That was just one of my trips. There was me heading to RI at 17, getting a speeding ticket for doing 95 on 95, summarily tossing that in the trunk, thereby forcing my father to start howling 3 months later when he got the letter from the state!!! It is just anomalous to me that there seems to be a new trend amongst kids and not wanting to get licensed right away. It is probably good anyway! I am also sure, however, there are things your dd would do in a snap, like behave, that was very foreign to me! Ginger: my grandfather ran for Mayor and even my sister recently told me I should go into politics! It is just such a behemoth, messy system.... I would join forces w/Gov Chris Christie in NJ because we have very much the same attitude!! I can go through someone like a knife through butter and it is this very candid nature that probably would negate the \"ass kissing\" requirement of so many politicians! Christie is the only one I have ever seen who I would even remotely consider running with and I am an Independent (like I had to tell you that!). When my sister told me I should go into politics I was like you know I am a serious Ahole but she responded with something to the effect of that is what we need, for more people to just set it straight. I am so glad you are feeling better. Good for you. I am so freakin' tired of gross meat but I don't know what else to do. Speaking of such matters, I went to Target yesterday and compared their Whey protein powder with EAS and Pure Protein and one other=they are all the same! Speaking of which, I have to go make one now. BTW, soy is less than 2% in all of these powders which my nutritionist in Survivorship Clinic said was fine. She also encouraged me to not vilify soy in such a way but I feel like I don't have a choice. It is estrogen's bff and how can I trust it now? I think we should make a broadway-caliber show on the underpinnings of cancer like let people know about cancer through an entertainment factor. It is the only way! Liver pain and NAFLD: As you all know, I have been having an eclectic mix of pains in my liver region. This could be caused by NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and guess what causes NAFLD? Yes, our friend Tamoxifen. I am so pissed. WTF with these doctors? Do I have to find out everything on the freakin' internet?  The internet is like my new cancer doctor! I have been complaining of pains in my liver for 7 months now. How did anyone with cancer, or any other disease, manage before the internet is my question? Tex is ok.  She is away right now.  I am sure she will post when she gets back and has some time. I hope you all are having a nice day.  Take care of yourselves or call your doctor, the internet, for help!!!!!!  ",

Innocent bystanders are slowly coming forward stating she was acting outrageous. Perhaps one person could have tried to intervene.

If you ever sat around, upsetting yourself with the most blatantly awful potential manifestation of your situation, it would be tantamount to lunacy! Seriously anybody, even those without our luscious disease, could sit around all day and think themselves to a bitter end. The only we can control is our reaction to this mess and you are a shining star example of maintaining the best outlook possible. We must fight the power!!!! On cassettes and walkmans, of course I, too, had the cassette walkman and Tex, even though my phone has over 3000 songs on it, I don't like to use my $600 phone when I am doing stuff so I have the new MP3/4 walkman. My entire family is on \"I\" also. I just have not gone there. In any case, I have about 40 cassettes and did not want to replace them all so I found this \"converter.\" It is cumbersome but it does actually work. Unfortunately I have to do 1 song at a time so it is a work-in-progress but I was so happy to get some of my cassettes onto my computer and then onto my phone and MP3 player. Good times! I had my (late) annual with my BS today and she found, on the side where the PET did not show uptake, an enormous lymph node. She asked me how long it had been there and I have no clue. I have to have an ultrasound on that tomorrow morning. As for the mass in the left pocket that did show PET uptake, it is being removed and sent for pathology. Because my doctors work in a clinic, my PS was there today seeing patients while my BS saw me so I was able to see both. They both agreed that the node has to be looked at asap and so the ultrasound, which will be done tomorrow, they will have before the mass is removed for pathology. If it, too, looks to be malignant, it will also be removed when the mass in the left breast pocket is. Either god is playing a mean trick on me with all these lumps, bumps and wayward PETs OR there is something rotten in the cotton! Soon I shall know more. This cancer stuff is a lot to keep track of. Well, tonight is my favorite line-up on the smut box (tv) so I am going to go get settled for some mindless entertainment! Happy trails, girls, and may the force be with you today and always!!",

Deb, did you ever hear of \"Slim in 6?\"  It is a set of DVDs that should be done for 6 weeks straight.  Apparently it is pretty successful.  When I saw that Janet Jackson is plugging NutriSystem, I checked out there site just a few minutes ago and saw a bunch talking about this DVD set in the discussion room.  I might try it.  Will let you know.   I *might* do the ball drop this year, Deb!   Should be fun!!!  Not sure yet as there are some parties but there is nothing like the spirit in Times Square NYE!  Actually, though, I want to go XC skiing on NY so will have to see if I can work it all out! Omaz: She is driving?!  That is sooo cool!  We did not have a family car because my father had sports cars.  We all got cars at 16. I will never, ever forget getting home from DMV on my 16th birthday and having a car waiting for me!!!!   It was the best.   My BMW had dual transmission and a lot of cars are made with that now.   That is stick for dummies, however!   I got a little more proficient at stick over the years but will never forget flying into JFK and my friend had flown out.  She gave me a cc of her key before I left so I could drive her car back and then get her at the aiport the following week.   Problem: her car was stick!  What a ride I had!  Congratulations to your dd!  So nice! Ginger: One of the few things I was happy about getting a bmx was no more bras.  I am so happy not to have to ever wear one again.  I have been giving away some old suits and coats, shoes etc.. and now bras.  I have been giving steadily all year because I have time and have been able to go through closets, the basement etc..   It is good to get rid of crap.  An ex left his golf clubs = goodbye!  Old skis= goodbye!  Tons of Plantronics headsets and amplifiers=goodbye!   CDs have been selling on Amazon= goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!  You feel better when it is done, I promise you!   Glad you are having fun with your dgd! Zenith: as for write-offs, yes, they give us receipts but I could care less about that this year as I have not worked.  I am just happy to get rid of stuff. I must admit, I miss your very funny posts!  The one about when you fell in the road, I still laugh about the way you told the story!  Hys-terical!  Happy New Year, woman! Tex: yes, mastectomy wear is a write-off...unless somehow your Gov has screwed you out of it!! He he he!  Tex, you are going to school for becoming a translator, correct?   Did you decide to go back to nursing?   Just wondering. OMG...Christmas: got a new Jack LaLane power juicer!!!  Also got a bike(very happy about this) and I actually bought  myself one of those things to jump your car battery and it also has a light on it, an AC adapter and an air hose to put air in tires?  It is pretty cool.   It was $150 but a few friends have them and swear by them so I thought it was a practical gift to me and won't have to wait for road service!  I got some Calphalon also!  Oh yeah, and I got Shape Ups which I wanted but only for doing their workout and using on my treadmill in the house.  There is a number of reports about hip injuries from using them regularly so I will certainly be avoiding that.  One thing I did want was the Tiffany heart-tag toggle necklace which I thought was like $2000 but it is actually $500 so I will get it for my birthday!   Feel good story: google \"Piper Killen.\"  Kids...unbelievable. I hope everyone is doing well and having an healthy and happy holiday season.  PLEASE, everyone, send me some good vibes next Tuesday....I am nervous about this.  If there was no mass on the sonogram this summer I would not be so scared but that combined with pain, ugh, hate this.   Oh well....we shall see.  I had to scare myself further by doing some research on liver cancer tonight.  Of the 564K diagnosed last year, 99% died within 1 year!   Effin cancer! Sweet dreams, everyone",

      "Content": "Feb 19, 2012 03:44PM 1WonderWoman wrote: Good evening my lovely warriors! I hope you all are having a good weekend and are fighting the good fight! Well, I have been crying most of the weekend! First this Whitney tribute and passing has had me carrying Kleenex all day, then one of my best friends' mother died today and my other very good friends' husband (is my age) was hospitalized with heart trouble. Geesh...the wheels are coming off the cart very fast now! As for my US, nothing makes sense. The \"big\" node my BS thought she found was actually, they think, muscle because they could not find it. They found one node that they thought was questionable but they will follow up on that. This entire medical industry is odd, nothing is ever definitive. Omaz: what is the connection with chemo and cholesterol? I have done some research and I am very surprised that my cholesterol is up since chemo. I have *never* had high cholesterol and my diet does not consist, at all, of the foods that cause cholesterol. Is this another belated chemo gift?! As for people going to the hospital with me, I only bring company on surgery days. For the most part, when it comes to all things cancer, I can very much do without people's comments! For this reason, I really do like flying solo! Hot flashes are tiring and, much like you, I have a number of blankets and I just keep adding them on as I cool off and then flip them off when the heat starts again. Tex: I am soooo sorry for your loss. No matter how much you know it is coming and how much you might prepare, it still hurts. My friend (guy) that lost his mom was tearing up with me today and her death was very expected. I don't live in that century of recording because everything in CT costs more than it does anywhere else and to get to the cable TV level of having that recording ability puts the cable bill at like $250 or something ridiculous and I am NOT paying $250/month to juice up the smut box!!! Even this absolute joker I was going out with when the cancer bus stopped at my place DVRd. He loved it. I mean he could barely figure out a cell phone but he was all about that DVR. In any case, I love \"Jeopardy.\" In my mothers' condo there were 35 stairs to the front door. Well, my cat at the time decided to get the toilet paper out of the closet, as the door was ajar, and put her little paws on the first sheet and rolled every roll to the front door!!!!! There was like 12 rolls undone! It was hysterical! She must have had some fun! Well, at the very least your kids are getting acquainted with recycling only in recycling items to manufacture! It is enterprising if you think about it! As for the hot flashes, they are bad. Just when I am dozing off, BANG, the flash comes on. Oddly I sweat from my forearms! I find that odd. I mean I sweat from everywhere but definitely from my forearms. In long, my forearms are your shins! As for fans, I sleep with 2 box fans in my room as they are very powerful. I just leave them on now...there is no sense in turning them on and off! Sptmm: that is so great that you are sleeping better. When my father was dying of lung cancer he said the worst thing about it was not being able to sleep as he was afraid to sleep because, of course, he was afraid he would not be able to catch his breath and would pass away. Of course that is not your issue but it speaks loudly to the debilitating effects of sleep deprivation. Glad the Arimidex is working out better in that regard. From 9-10 times down to 3-4 is a huge improvement! How are you doing with running? I got to thinking, I am going to get back to that treadmill and try to get myself to the point where I am doing a slow jog again. I am oddly starting to feel a little more motivated these days about getting back to normal. Perhaps it is my way of coping with the potential for recurrence! I don't know but I just thought I would like to run again. Deb, I have a question for you but it is actually for everybody: who is monitoring your endometrial lining business? I have NO CLUE what could be going on with my endometrial lining, I have not had my cycle in almost 2 years and no one has ever mentioned anything about that to me. I was really wondering about that. Funny, if you ever thought cats were unto themselves exclusively, this will drive it home! In a hallway I have a montage of both my father and mother. Since my mother's passing, I find myself talking to her pictures at night. Well, one night I was really in the throes of a good cry and I heard my cat jump off her window perch and come toward me. She left the room she was in, walked right past me blubbering and talking to my mother's picture and marched right into another room where she would have a little snack and some water! She then proceeded to walk right past me again and headed back to her perch!!! It was hysterical! At least her lack of concern for me got me laughing!! OH CANADA!!!!!!! How are you jokers doing?! Yes, I am talking to you, Sweeney and Rachel!  Hope you all are well. Signing off as I am watching SNL!  May the force be with you ALL!!! ",

Tex: I feel moderately treasonous for announcing your major change that you communicated to me in PM...I am sorry!   I did not mean it.  I really feel bad.  You should have been able to make your announcement when you were ready.   I hope you accept my apology. Tex, question: how come you never went to Anderson?  Perhaps I am wrong and you do go to Anderson.   I just found out they are the #1 cancer hospital in the country.    Then again I am starting to remember when I talked of meeting up with you when I was supposed to go to TX in the fall, you are as few hours from Houston.   About going to TX, probably in the Spring so we will meet up.  I am looking forward to meeting up with you.  We will make a day of it!   Trouble, Inc. traveling around TX together...we might end up on that joker Perry's watch list!!!!!!! Omaz: the scariest story I heard last year was your friend with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  I was stunned.  I am so glad they were over for dinner and she is walking with a cane and doing much better.  It is still, however, scary that the syndrome relegated her to the state she is in right now and details about causes are negligible.   I am very happy for her just the same.   I still just can't believe it.  Scary stuff, indeed.  May she have a much better 2012 with 100% recovery in order! I hope your dd is getting better with stick!   So much fun to be driving...she must be having a blast! Sptmm: your post made me LOL at the idea that I might be seeing the same onc as you were!  I am glad you made a change to another.  If I have mets off to MSK I go.  I am hoping we have under 2 surgeries this year!   That would be a huge gift for both of us, sad as it sounds!   If I have mets, however, well....we know the story there!   I will probably exceed 2 surgeries in January!  Hopefully that is NOT the case! Ckptry: I continue to be in awe of all that you handle with your children, challenging the \"get in the middle or else\" mentality in the public school system and keep yourself together at the same time.   I am in awe of everyone on this thread, as I am the only one without children, who have gone through this battle and had to look in the eyes of your little ones and know that you had to reach deep inside and fight very hard to battle this disease for their sake.   I don't know how you, and everyone else here, has handled all that has come your way.  It all speaks to, and is very much indicative of, human nature at its very finest.  As always, I have to thank you for your insight along the way as it was a total blessing.  May 2012 be easier in every way for you.      Ladyinbama: my BIL who died this past February was a very good hearted guy.   His brother, on the other hand, pretty much a self-centered jerk.   My sister just saw him a few days ago and he said he separated from his wife and that she threw him out etc... Well my sister knows how he is so she called his soon-to-be ex to find out what was going on.  She is STAGE 3 and her prognosis is not good.  It turns out he was not taking her to any appointments and was being indifferent ie: mentally abusive through her entire cancer battle.  Finally she threw him out because she was disgusted.   When he told my sister the story, however, he never mentioned she was Stage 3 and not well.   My sister is 10 years older than I and her BIL is 55.  At 55 he is acting like a pathetic sack.   They reap what they sow, lady, and there is no gift in store for such blatant disregard of a soul.  I think I told you my father had a friend whose wife left him when he was dxd.   There is a special place in hell for these people.   I wish you the best and onwards and upwards, my friend!  A much better 2012 and may you find a man, if you so choose, who values the soul over the body.   They are indeed very rare but are out there.   Make a list of what you want in a partner and check it twice.  The first alarm, walk away.   Don't waste your time and treat all dates like interviews.   I wish you the best! Calamtykel: your battle with the terrible SEs from tamox was awful.  I am glad you found vindication in learning exactly why that was happening.  It feels good to know you are not going crazy.   Your battles with the health insurance nonsense in NJ was cumbersome as well. May 2012 bring you less insurance hassles, better health and may no idiots from FB ever judge you again!     Ginger: may you continue to have wonderful times with your dgd and dd!  I hope you have cleared out your sewing room and are still taking your class.   More importantly, may you feel better and stronger in the coming year.   Adey: I hope you are enjoying your new boobs and you have a great NYE!   our experience has been very much sympatico and in this I took solace on more than one occassion.    Wherria: I know you pop in and out on us but I want to tell you I hope 2012 brings you back to your running roots!   I hope you are well and best of luck to you in the new year. As it turns out, 2010 we were all dxd except Rachel who I think was dxd initially in 2009.   2011 was pretty much a year of clean-up from the dx, chemo, surgeries and all the \"omg, did it spread?\" terrifying moments.   Hopefully 2012 will be the year we make peace with hopefully having moved beyond bc and hit our stride with this whole matter. Finally, to all our \"viewers,\" I hope you have found help, understanding, hope, information and a sense that you are not alone.  You don't have to post but I am very happy that, in some way, you have found our posting interesting enough to read and, in this electronic way, it is my hope our reach has far exceeded our grasp.",

Omaz: thanks so much for the reminder. I am now using my \"OneNote\" software in the MS suite of tools to keep track of important facts regarding bc. I just added that estrogen note because I know full well I have asked that cholesterol question before! That \"emwave\" software sounds really cool. How does that work? What got you onto it? The best thing for stress is weightlifting. If you work your traps (all those ladies on the red carpets at the award shows cannot buy that neck/shoulder area at a plastic surgeon!) that releases a lot of stress . If you stand with your weight in hand, palms toward your legs, and pull the weights up to your chin (keeping them close to the body), you will feel a nice release of stress. You can also do it at the gym on the smith machine. Sptmm: how are you doing with running? You really inspire me. I am serious. I love what you have accomplished since chemo ended. As for the next steps, see PM! On crying, I have not responded to this dx with tears ever. Actually once I did when the radiologist came into the little room I was waiting in after the mammo and declared, in no uncertain terms, I get a biopsy immediately as there was definitely a problem! What a way to be told you have cancer!!! Also they prescribed an antidepressant to help with hot flashes around chemo time. That really numbed me. It was so weird. At dinner last night with friends there were 10 of us and 3 knew, or had been, on that antidepressant and they all spoke to the numbness factor. BTW, all the talk they help with hot flashes was definitely not the case for me. I went off of it a while ago and the hot flashes are as bad as they ever were. For some, however, maybe these pills do help with hot flashes? I don't know. I know what you mean, though, about feeling almost like you can't cry. Until my mother died, and I was able to cry again, I was starting to wonder if I would ever feel anything again. I am positive by nature and if I think about the relationships I have wasted tears on, cancer should have certainly warranted some but I just did not get all teary-eyed about cancer. I do feel odd about it but alas I have many other things to worry about! Deb, if you see \"Mr. Circles\" on the sidelines, you should walk over and ask him if he recognizes your boobs!!! On the lack of sweat, I was never an \"underarm\" sweater but I do know that LNs are an irrigation system and with some/many of them gone, as much water is not invited to that area thus less/no sweat. Also rads can kill sweat glands. Rachel: have a good, restful day! May your onc gyn appt be uneventful in March. I hope you all are having a good day. I am looking forward to summer this year. I don't know why as we have had a mild winter but I am hopefully going to be healthy enough to enjoy this year! I mean really enjoy like be active, and go swimming and to water parks (my guilty pleasure!) and not have to worry about crap leaking into my open wound!!",

I owe someone an apology!!!!!  I can't remember who I recommended \"Bad Teacher\" to but that movied SUCKED!!!!   Seriously, the first time I watched it was at my friend's house and we were doing spa night which means manis, pedis, facials, this traveling \"massage\" clown (he he he!) and COSMOS!  I guess I had a few too many because I watched it again tonight and it was really not good at all!  My apologies and I think it was LadyinBama who I recommended it to!  Sorry, Lady, as if you don't have enough troubles I tell you a movie is funny (perhaps after several Cosmos!) which was awful! Calamtykel: the credit rating system is a mess.  It is all designed to \"getcha.\"  I despise credit cards and I am probably one of the last people in the Western Hemisphere who likes to use \"cash\" for everything.  I despise the entire credit game and I am sorry you are going to have those bills on there.  I have a credit monitoring service where you can make a note or something in your file.  More importantly, I would get on it and keep a journal of contacts.  For instance, fax every 5 days until they remove it.   Just make sure it is consistent and you keep doing it until they remove it from your report.  If it is valid, those are small a$$ bills and a credit, unless trying to be super advantageous, should not even be remotely concerned.  Repos, judgements and foreclosures...those are the favorites for jacking rates.  Your credit card company are just trying to make some money and unfortunately they scan reports all day looking for reasons to jack rates.  I would seriously look at the legislation Obama put through on credit cards because although we are always convinced they are knee-deep in lawyers and know the game so much better than we do, that they are always right, is not the case.   They try to \"get away\" with a lot and I was only pretty sure some of the legislation he passed was about them not being able to increase interest rates in such a manner.  All I know is I pay my cards off in full, every month, and they **hate** me!  Not making any money on me so they hold my payments for like 7 days!  You see, banks/credit card companies make the bulk of their money through interest and trading in the overnight markets.  The fees are gravy.   #fightthepower!!!!! Hope everyone is well and happy dreams to all!  ",

I do believe I have to take it easy for a year to make sure there are no mets and to get comfortable again with being alive!!  Ok, so it is 5 degrees here and I have to go to Redbox...not happy!  ",

There was one he found where the animal that had the dog had him hanging from a tree behind his house where his paws could barely touch the ground so as to strengthen his neck.  My cousin gives him extra love!  I think he has 7 now.  I don't go for animal abuse and I sure as hell don't go for people abuse.  There was this one day where an animal was roughing her kid up on her way into Walmart.  I stopped and told her unless she wanted me to twist her arm up like that and slap her in the head then she better stop and my next call was to the police.  I am one of those people that DOES NOT WATCH.  If I had kids of my own etc... I am sure I would be thinking twice so I understand the \"watchers\" but watchers need to be balanced with \"doers!\" That is where I come in!  Ginger:  I believe we are very much sympatico.  I will tell people right away when they are wrong.  Last year when I was on chemo this miserable thing was getting cigarettes and she was upset b/c the cashier was not moving fast enough.   I need not tell you more when I tell you she turned to me and said \"they\" don't even like to work.  When I pressed her as to who she was talking about she gestured with her chin toward the cashier.  I explained in my current state of health I just about lived there and that woman was always working hard as far as I could tell.  Then she did the unthinkable and TOSSED change on the counter for the cashier to pick up.  The cashier looked at her for a few uncomfortable seconds and I stepped in before she did something was cause her to lose her job.  I told that curmudgeon that her behavior was indicative of a complete lack of social etiquette and that she should hurry along and smoke her demise!  Of course I picked the change up off the counter and handed it to the cashier....and, like I said, I was on chemo!!!!!!!  Ginger I firmly believe it will only be better if we make it better.  Not everyone has to be like you and I but there need be more of us.  Definitely needs to be more of us and GOOD FOR YOU that you put that lawyer in its place!   Pronouns are fun, aren't they?!  ",

I am just glad you were able to understand why there was not a connect. We are fragile human beings and yet that fragility is all that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom so I will take the emotional ride! Not like the choices are abundant! Mommichelle: thank you so much. How did your surgery go, btw? Just wondering. You never came back to report and, if I recollect correctly, it is going on 3 weeks now? Let me know how you are. Sweeney: thank you! Moms are very special and as all the women here are moms, remember how special you are to those little jokers! Rachel: keep us posted on your check-ups. I had a cervical cancer question some years ago and I remember the in-office procedure the gyn did hurt for a long time. Perhaps your pains are just your body still adjusting post-surgery. I hope all is well. Ckptry: you are going to think I am nuts, if you don't already, as when I joined this board and everyone was talking about tattoos, I thought they were getting like cartoon characters where their nipples used to be!!!!!!!!!!! I really thought they were going to a tattoo parlor and, even with my wild partying, I am physically conservative as I have no piercings beyond my ears and no tattoos etc... so I was stunned and all I could think was this bc really turns people around!! I remember one woman talking about going to FL, if memory serves, and it was some big bc event and she was getting her tattoos done there! All I could think was \u2018this sounds like bike week!'  and secretly I wondered what they were like before bc!!!  In long, good luck with your TATS! That is funny about the hair comment from your dd and also the fact it is coming back so fast also! Ch-Ch-Ch-CHIA! Finally, congratulations on that port removal!!!!! YAY!!! It feels so good to get that thing O-U-T! Calamtykel: you LOVE to run. Change your shoes, tape your foot, do what you have to. I remember going to football and hockey practices with my brothers and when they were in pain/something broken, tape, tape, tape! It was always the answer. NO, you are not a downer: CANCER EFFING SUCKS! There is no 2 ways about it. Don't apologize for being at cancer for taking away our endurance and strength. Let's hope this is temporary. You are singing to the choir with the weight shit. I could not stand injuries when I was a workout-aholic. I, too, could feel myself getting fat. Don't worry. It will get better. A little time should do the trick. Not being able to workout sucks but don't think it is always going to be like that now. I am sure, just like every other injury, there is a fix. Ice/heat, tape! I am in the worst shape of my life right now and it is an awful place to be. If I ever get free of surgeries, which I hope is soon, I need 1 year back at the gym, hard, and I will be back in decent shape. It is very hard when you have to take time off. My workouts have been fits-and-starts for 2 years now...I want to scream!!!!! In fact, I will and just did!!!!!!!!! For now we all have to look to SPTMM who has achieved physical excellence post-bc!!!!!! You make us all proud, island warrior!!!!!! It was a good weekend although I am still deeply ambivalent about those Van Halen tickets being $150...yes, I will stop my whining...I will be going!!!!!! Happy trails all and may the force be with you!  ",

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2012 09:46PM - edited Feb 1, 2012 09:51PM by 1WonderWoman Ginger: I am so sorry to hear of what happened to you.  That is very scary.  Someone today was just saying on they were on TC and how it was awful.  I understand all chemo is awful but when I told her I was on TAC she looked at me wondering how I was still alive!  It was funny to say the least.  More to this point, chemo does send some belated gifts.  Perhaps something just did not agree with you and the linings of our stomachs and organs are worn out a bit from chemo so we might just experience everything a lot more.  What I am trying to say is our nerves might be more visceral and something like what you experienced only happened because you could actually feel it and perhaps, under normal (pre-chemo/bc) circumstances that same thing could happen and you would not have felt it so sharply.  I am with Kel on the clean scans---good news!!!!!!! Isn't it hard to believe sometimes, though?  All we were ever taught about this disease is how insidious it is.. I find it hard to believe it is gone.  Very hard!  I hope you are feeling better.  Even driving there sounded scary.   Calamtykel: These are rough days for loss.  My BIL died last year at the same time your father did so the anniversary of his death is coming up on the 8th and I am still mourning the loss of my mother.  I don't think I fully connect with the fact that she is gone.  It is hard to even fathom.  In fact, a few days ago I caught myself, for a moment, planning to go and visit her.  I don't think it has hit me yet that she is gone.  When my father died I hit Wall St hard, working 16 hour days and partying 16 hour nights.  It was a rough time but not a total crash and burn...although it could have been.  I was making tons of money and I was so busy I just had no time to mourn.  Unhealthy as that sounds, it was my process.  I am noticing that I am doing the same thing again.  Keeping so busy I just can't think about it.  I miss her. I wish you well with the anniversary of your dad's passing coming up.  It is really hard to even believe they are gone and then furthermore what \"gone\" means.  I am completely not the person who hears and/or sees ghosts but the woman who lived in this house prior had died of cancer.  One night, before I moved in, I was just here, checking some things out.  I went into the bedroom that was her's and suddenly I heard, loud and clear, \"excuse me!\"  She was obviously upset and I guess she did not know she was dead and/or I was tresspassing.  This is a very, library-like, quiet, quiet neighborhood, day and night.  This voice did not come from outside but rather she was here.  The first time in my life I ever had that experience.  Something else odd happened here: I found out she had a dog the hard way!  I was standing at the kitchen sink one night and there was a growling sound, right behind me, and it would have been a bigger type dog as the growling was right behind my elbow.  By now I realized that the \"essence\" of this woman, and now her dog, was still here.  So I told him to shut up and go lay down and that we were living together now!  I promise you, never has stuff like that happened to me.  I found out about 6 months after the growling that, in fact, she had a chocolate lab!   A few nights after my mother died my cat's eyes kept looking past my shoulder and her pupils got really big.   I don't know what happens when we pass on but one of the VNA nurses mentioned something not too long ago and that is that we don't go anywhere but rather we stay here and just move on to another dimension. You and I will never know, until we know, what happens but I will say that I feel her presence.  My sister does also.  I hope you feel the presense of your father, Kel. Ugh...awful on the cycle!!!!  I don't know why but when the bc bus stopped by my house I went out and got loads of Advil, Tylenol, Tylenold cold and flu, heat wraps, like $300 worth of Graham Webb hair products (I know...what an effin idiot!) and all kinds of junk.  Well, having been the pic of health before bc, I don't need all this stuff so tonight I went to Hartford Hospital to see my Godson who got hurt in wrestling.  I packed about $100 worth of \"CVS stuff!\" to give to his mom, my best friend.  In any case, I also gave her a bunch of \"cycle\" products as I deeply suspect, as I am going on 1.5 years w/out the cycle, that it will ever come back.  On that long note, I feel for you!  I personally am very glad it is gone! On the article, I was just elated to know that finally, finally, at long last, they are developing a vaccine that \"talks to\" the immune system and lets it know those cells have to go.  That is a huge breakthrough even though it is not everything just yet.  I think it might be one of the most promising developments in bc history.  I am easily elated!!!   Well, I hope everyone has sweet dreams!   ",

Well, my gym locker kept getting broken into and, not joking, I must have gone through 10 pair of Reebok classics that year!   He used to take me to concerts also.  There was a theater in CT not far from our house and the first concert I ever saw with him was \"Sha Na Na (sp?)\"  and that Bowzer guy!  It was fun.  He and his wife used to take me to all kinds of shows with them at that theater.  We saw Kenny Rogers, Barbara Mandrell (sp?), Kenny Loggins...I don't know...can't remember but there was a bunch of stuff!  In fact, one of my busy projects these days is going through tons of pics, categorizing them into 5 year blocks and then ziplocing each and placing them in small totes. Each small tote represents 5 years and so on.  I found a pic of he and I the other day and he was holding me and I was screaming because my Godfather used to scare the daylights out of me as he had a beard!  I have a lot of good memories with my father.  He was really good to my bf when I was in elementary and middle school who came from a single parent home.  He was like her dad also.  He was a good man and I miss him forever.  I think he was such a great example of what a dad should be that any of these jokers I met in my life would never measure up!  ",

That is very interesting about the Stage 0 and 1 bcs.  I never heard that.  I kind of wonder if people without health insurance are doing better than we are?!  Seriously, they can't get checked so they don't and that is that!  A friend had skin cancer and she lost her benefits when of course, thanks to the econ, she lost her job and she has not been to a dr in over 6 years about the cancer thing and she is not even remotely concerned.  Go figure.  Is it necessary that it get treated or does the body kill cancer by itself?  A question for the ages, no doubt! Good day, woman and glad you are doing well. ",

Which is a good thing since this Friday is indeed the 13th. The first written reference to the evilness of this day came in a biography of the great composer, Rossini, who regarded both Friday and the number 13 as unlucky. Strangely enough, he died on Friday, 13th November, 1868. (Another example of drawing towards you what you most fear...) The origins of this superstition can be found in Norse myth. When the Norse tribes converted to Christianity, Frigga, the goddess of love (whose day was Friday) was banished and labelled a witch. Thereafter, every Friday, this unpredictable goddess gathered together eleven witches and the devil, making a total of thirteen.",

This time the mass in my left breast pocket will be removed and sent off to pathology. I will then have 2 weeks to be sick to my stomach, waiting to find out if my friend cancer is back. I appreciate the value of a PET scan, however, as it will find even the most minute traces of cancer unlike the scans where we have to wait until the tumor is the size of a quarter! The \"mass\" in the left breast pocket is huge. I hope it is just necrotic. In long, once again I will need all your positive vibes getting me through surgery and that I don't have bc recurrence/new primary. Tex: I can't believe you don't know you are our THREAD ROCK STAR! You have such a positive outlook no matter what you are going through. Clearly this is the smartest way to go and you do it well. I used sing to this miserable pack of whackos I worked with my first job out of college, when they were bickering, the \"Coca Cola\" theme (I'd like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony...!) because I felt they needed it! Of course, they wanted to kill me but I just always felt when you wake up you have a choice to either be happy or be sad. It really comes down to a choice and you, my friend, make the most beneficial choice always! You are a ray of sunshine ;) Speaking of costs, I went to an oral surgeon to find out about options for the crown I lost compliments of chemo. They would not do anything on me in November b/c I had just been operated on. In any case, and I have *excellent* dental insurance, I thought it was a \"free\" consult!!! WRONG it was $95! I could not believe the audacity. He sat with me for 10 minutes, would not shut the eff up so I could get a word in (I talk and THINK fast) and he just kept going on not to mention he was 30 minutes late. We so need socialized med in this country. This has got to stop. Sptmm: what is up with this weather, sister?! Got me some Vit D today! Wow...it is beautiful out! Perhaps you are out running and I would not blame you. What a nice day. We have had such an incredibly mild winter and this makes me very happy! I just want to let Tex know, with her 78 announcement, that we hit 62 yesterday!!!!!!!!! WHOO HOO! Ginger: I know about those huge slugs in Washington! A went to visit a friend about 7 years ago and it would seem as if they were mutations of perhaps bears and slugs!! Iowa: good for you on the Harley spin in FL!!! Do you all go to bike week? I worked with a woman once who was the scariest woman I ever met!  She used to ride her Harley to work and she was one tough momma.  In any case, I was all of maybe 135lbs and was lifting so I looked like I was about 110, if that.  She was a good 225 and 5'8\" maybe.  Well, she did not really like me too much.  One day my friend Joe and I were playing with her super ball and I accidentally backed over it with my chair and it fell apart!!!!  I was so scared so Joe used glue to put it back together!  She was at lunch while this all happened.  When she got back the first thing she did, which she always did, was go to bounce that ball up against the wall and it broke into pieces!  Joe was doing the finger knife across his neck, looking at me! She did not see him but Joe came over and said \"you are attractive but I don't know how cute you are going to look after she drags you outside and burns you with the pipes on that bike!!!\"  Joe took the fall for me!  In any case, she was the one who used to go to bike week.  I was just happy she would be gone for a week!!   Calamtykel: Burger King?! WTH?!?!? Geesh...well, if you think about it, kind of makes sense! I am going to the ER, let me get some BK on the way! At least they will be in the right place when that crap grabs hold of their heart! You know, you really hate to judge but there are people out there scoffing down garbage food and doing all types of drugs meanwhile us jokers are fighting for our lives. It is such a paradox. Those jokers will probably still be here, laughing over their cheeseburgers and marijuana, and we will all be long gone! You know, I really feel bad about the couple who went to jail b/c they did not have MONEY to get their child healthcare. This country is crazy. They tax the shit out of us and still we have to pay for education and healthcare. It is a HOT MESS, that's what it is. I don't what they are going to do but I fear if something does not happen soon there is going to be a revolution. About 3 weeks ago I noticed my gas was going down in my car quite a bit. I just park in the driveway and could not figure out why my gas area door thingy was not working properly. Sure enough, apparently someone had been siphoning my gas! I don't know if it was at my house or the mall or when I was in New Haven but somewhere it had been happened, and more than once from what I could tell. I went to buy a locking gas cap for the bargain price of $45 and I have 2 cars but did not buy 2 at that wonderful price! All I am saying is if it keeps up like this, there are going to be some big problems in this country most likely in the form of a revolution of some sort. Omaz: what is shaking in the desert?  Oh, btw, I tried your evening drink and accidentally added rum...JOKE!  Seriously, though, I think it did help.  Thank you for that. Dr. Oz: I am sorry but I am addicted.  So I watched yesterday and he was talking about tea, as follows: in the AM have 2 cups of \"Per Hu\" tea; at lunch have one cup of white tea; at dinner have chickweed (1 cup) and at night have Bilberry (1 cup).  Also, the chickweed was a mild diuretic/laxative (bonus!!!!!) and TODAY I learned that if you have a cup of water in the morning and then gargle, with just plain old water, for 2-3 mins when you wake up, you will move out \"stuff\" that settles in your throat over night.  He said this mucous that settles in the throat can sap energy.  In any case, I find his show very interesting.  So gargle tomorrow!   Well, girls, off to hospital I go next week to have this rock removed! God help me! What's more is I feel like a sore throat is coming on and my ears feel clogged AND I am currently on Augmentin!!!! Can you believe this? I hope I am healthy next week for surgery. Of course my thyroid is out of whack since chemo ended and that compromises my immune system....I don't know why she swallowed the fly, I guess she will die!!!!!!!! One thing leads to another!

I don't think if I had children if I could do as well as you in that area mainly because I am still a neophyte in the kitchen! I will never forget dating this guy who had gone to a culinary institute in Switzerland. He came over to my place one night and I was really not having him over for his cooking but I played along nonetheless! He whipped up a fantastic dish from the spices and a few condiments I had in my refrigerator coupled with some frozen mahi mahi I had. It was really good. He was like McGyver in the kitchen....I do believe you and he have that in common!

Who the heck eats this stuff?! She would try to force it on us but there was no way. All gross....gross, gross, gross! That flu was kicking some serious butt here. Friends were reporting taking nearly 2 weeks to get over it. I did not have a flu shot and I believe, while on an antibiotic, I got a touch of the flu. I was later dxd w/bronchitis but I still feel that although the dx was bronchitis, I had a touch of the flu in there somewhere. My friend is a PS school teacher and my GP told me by virtue of her job, she is exposed to germs I would never be with not having kids etc.... This was the origin of my bronchitis/flu! I am feeling ok today and this week (ATTN CKPTRY, CALAMTYKEL, SPTMM!!!!) we all are going to hit 60-70 degrees!!!!! YAY!! I am so happy as the St. Pat's parades are this weekend!! I am just so happy to be Irish and healthy this weekend! Omaz: chicken thighs...I was just looking at them yesterday at Stop and Shop. In your perspicacious mind I am sure you can envision me perusing the contents of chicken body parts! I went with cutlets, as per usual, but there was a small part of me that was thinking aboutbranching out!!! I hope everyone is having a good day. Be well my lovely warriors!",

Wherria: I was talking to a friend this weekend who had a black lab in high school he loved.  He also had a benigh tumor in his head, the size of a baseball, that had to be removed.   His lab went through all of the surgeries with him and was right by his side for most of the lengthy recovery but apparently Bear had his own challenges.  Dogs, as I am sure you know, are very intuitive and knew my friend was not healthy and my friend, still today, believes that Bear let go so he would not be a burden and harm my friend's recovery.  My friend truly believes Bear did not want him to redirect the attention he needed to get himself better, to his now sick dog.  Bear, the lab, died at 8 which is kind of premature for a lab but I think Bear knew best and, although it hurt my friend terribly to lose his best friend, the harm and suffering my friend and Bear would go through trying to support each other to better health would have been no good to either one of them.  In the end, he feels his dog let go so he could get better.  I hope this helps you deal with Bixby's parting a little better.  Again, though, I am sorry for your loss.  Can you tell I love animals?!

I pulled this from the internet for you: So you've gone to your doctor and had some blood test done. You are looking over the results wondering why the hell you have low MCHC? Here are some reasons why this can occur. The first reason would be anemia. This is when your body is low on what it needs regarding energy. Usually iron deficiency. Healthy people have an adequate number of correctly sized red blood cells containing enough hemoglobin to carry sufficient oxygen to the body.

Other drugs used to treat cancer such as thalidomide and interferon also can cause peripheral neuropathy. I am only pretty sure I read somewhere that putting fingers and toes in water helps with neuropathy and, if memory serves, it was cold water.  I will get back to you on that one.  Make sure you are not running the shower too hot and I know it is August and this should not be an issue but it is 65 in Connecticut today and will be low 50's this evening.   In any case, I will gather more information for you and will post later. Calamtykel: unfortunately my onc told me unequivocally TAC SE's get worse with each tx.  I don't think any of the numbers are things to worry about but just try to keep a low profile while doing chemo if you can.   I think the best thing is to just stay in.  I have a friend from work who thinks being out on disability is some sort of party time and I had to remind this person I have CANCER and am about to start chemo so, no, not too much fun here.   She was questioning what I have been doing etc...!!!!  Yeah...fun times...avoiding people so I can stay healthy.  People don't even think...what does she think I am at Six Flags!?!?  Whackos!  I am answering my phone less and less these days!!!!!

I am also like you with the hair business. I finally bought a wig and I am a weekend baseball cap wearer anyway so I had NO shortage of those! I also bought a scarf. The ACS has some links to sites they condone! I have been using one and am happy with the stuff (hat/scarf combo, hat, wig, scarf) I have gotten from them. If you want the link, PM me. I do have to do something with this hair as chemo is starting next week. It is all becoming so real. Zachsmom: good way to start the day! Good luck today. Sweeney: swag it up, sister, but in no way are you in Rachel's INTERNATIONAL swag category!!!!! Or perhaps Swag-less with that parking lot gig!!!!! Question: is there a reason they give us makeup? Is it like special chemo makeup?! I now this sounds stupid but I really don't know if chemo affects our skin and that is why they give us this makeup? I am not going until September 16 but was just wondering what the story was with makeup. I mean I wear it now but no cover up and stuff like that...mascara, eyeliner, a bit of blush and lANCOME JUICY TUBES!!! I am going broke at the rate I lose those $20 jokers! Omaz: ridin' the Asian train with Rachel!!! A little acupuncture, a little wigging! There is so much flavor on this board!!!!! Calamtykel: you are absolutely correct in this is our big chance to have some fun with these wigs, turbans, hats, scarves etc... ! We could never do this under normal circumstances and I know, we all would gladly give up chemo and skip wig fun if we could but it is our class this semester and we must take it!

Lisa: You might be able to get a job on an Old Navy commercial as you now look like a terribly attractive mannequin!!!!!!!   Speaking of bald, when I was at the hospital today there was a young girl, so young, like 15 but she was in adult radiology.  Perhaps she was older but all I can say is she was in a wheelchair and I just felt so bad.  It was so sad.   She was so cute with her baldy head but I just felt so bad for her.   Ok, I am through crying about my pre-chemo SE's!!!!!!!!!! ",

Also, on the work discussion, I was just talking to my boyfriend about that very topic.  I want to try to get back to work as I am getting bored and am just not sure what to do.  He said there will be other jobs but there will never be another body so you really need to focus 100% on your health and stress does not help the body heal.   You seem to really like what you do but rest is so very important right now.  I hope you can come to a decision that puts your health first.  I know work is an obvious requirement that we really can't avoid but I think we all need to be sure our bodies can appropriately heal while we try to work also.   I just wish you well in the way you are feeling today, in hopes you feel better soon, and that you come to the correct decision regarding caring for yourself and trying to strike a balance with the necessary (evil!) of work obligations.

I think the first few days after tx it is very good to take it easy and drink water...whadda life!!! Ginger: I think it is great that you talked to your friend about your needs. All kinds of relationships go to waste because of lack of communication. It might, in the end, test the strength of the relationship but better to find out.　 Ladyinbama: I got fake eyebrows and fake eyelashes at a site online. If you want the address, PM me and I will send it. I don't know anything that saves them, however. I also found a site that sells human hair eyebrows! You are 100% correct about the rigorous testing and them finding things that were always there/indicative of a past trauma. I realized also when I was young we were playing Evil Kinevil with a makeshift ramp and I sped up my bike as fast as possible, went right up the ramp and while airborne the bike went sideways and I hit the ground, just about head first! I still have a scar near my brow to show for that little accident! There goes my father, rushing me to the ER again only this time with blood streaming down my face! I am so lucky I had such a great dad! Zenith: thank you so much for your words on my bone scan spook!   I would not go to Stage IV unless someone told me I was a Stage IV....I guess mets makes me a IV?  If Lance Armstrong can be testicular, lung and brain cancer, hopefully I can handle skull mets if that is what it turns out to be!  The other thing I always bear in mind is no one ever told me I would be here forever.   Unfortunately BC makes us confront our mortality...and I did not want to see 90 anyway!!!!!!! JSW: glad things seem to be going ok for you.   It is always nice to have things go BETTER than expected! All: I have been researching skull cancer, of course, and it seems as if I fractured it either in the car crash, slammin' sledding accident (!), or when doing my bike tricks, that it should have repaired itself by now and not show up on a bone scan?  Who knows...I am sure \"they\" know as much as I do! Wherria: we are all prone to overreact to our friends and it is because our own emotions are in the blender every day with this dx.  Better to talk to us than her anyway!   We are all where you are and our friends are not.  This is the unload spot!!!!! I hope you all are having a great weekend! Your FEARLESS Leader....and, no, skull mets will NOT scare me either!",

I think you will be happier with the port and will save your arms from overuse.  Did you have an mx, bmx, a lump or none of the above?  I had bmx and b/c of node involvement I only have 1 arm they can use so that is why a port was all but necessary for me.

In any case, what our sharing also did was remind me what a special group and a special thread we have here and I appreciate you all for sharing, so unabashedly, about yourselves and about everything you have been going through with chemo.  This thread has become so much more than I ever expected it to be and that is entirely because of you all. I thank you all for being so wonderful!!!!!! Finally, we are going to give out the weekly Super ChemoSabi cape!   Every week we are going to honor one person who had a really tough time and made it through.  I am going to go back 3 weeks and give it to Wherria and then last week it went to Sweeney and now this week I think it should go to Calamtykel for surviving that road rage and keeping her 4 children safe and secure.  That road rage that I shared with you scared me beyond belief; I had no idea what I drove into the middle of.  Consequently, we have several capes so we can nominate more than one person each week!!!!!!!!!!  I have an endless supply of capes for our chemosabis!  Let me know what you all think. I wish you all strength this week and the ability to see this is a means to an end.  This, too, shall pass, Your FEARLESS Leader",

You all-I try desperately to be supportive and never to complain on these boards but I have to chime in on this radiation matter!!!!   In the past 2 weeks I have had a bone scan, CT scan (abdomen, pelvis area), chest xray, skull xray, dental xrays, muga scan and NOW I am being told the head xray was not definitive enough now I have to GO DRINK THAT CHALK again next week and have a CT scan of my head!!!!  If the freakin' cancer was not in my head already, there is pretty good chance after all this radiation exposure that it is going to be there now.  This also means chemo is pushed off until September 16th b/c they have to get the results, meet with me, mix up my cocktail and get it all going.  To be honest, I saw a mark on the back of my skull after the head xray yesterday but that is also a spot where I split my head open in the back and had to have 35 stitches.   Now this is going to be a long ass weekend and a long freakin' weekend until Tuesday when the scheduling of the CT scan begins.   I try to be supportive at all times so I am sorry for this little tangent but I am just so aggravated right now and I, too, am (now not so secretively) concerned about how much exposure to radiation I have.  GRRR!   I am getting worn out.   Between the scans and the cancer-inviting radiation exposure, I am probably going to glow and die by the 16th!!!!!  Gadzooks! Sorry girls...I will get over this but am sufficiently frustrated right now.  I know this is being done to help me but I do have a life to get back to!!!",

I took that from \"Parks and Rec!\"  I hope it will be the 16th.  The *final* CT scan is Thursday.  The beginning of next week is chemo teaching and then fill the prescriptions and off I go!   We are starting at the same time!!! YEAH!!!  Frankenhusband!  Good to hear from you today. Calamtykel: another one examining every strand!  Your DH will undoubtedly be pulling his own out soon!  On the friends, my hairdresser of 14 years came over when she found out I had bc and gave me a big story about how she would go shopping and other associated word vomit.  Mind you, this was not a request but her telling me all that she would do.  We left off with me giving her my front door key and I told her forget everything else and just check on my cat while I am in the hospital, if need be, as I did not know how long I might be.  Not only did I never hear from her again, I went to Lowe's several times trying to get my front door key copied so I could give others the key just in case and I could NOT get an appropriate copy made.  I ended up giving out the back door key and had to leave the sensor lights on in the back so not only did all the animals run up my electric bill but I am sure my backyard looked like a disco for 2 nights!   The back door is a little tricky also.  In any case, finally she mails the key back to me and ACCUSES me of not keeping in touch with her.  Please, anybody, do you all contact your friends to give them bc updates!?!?!?  When one is sick, especially with something like bc, under the aegis of social etiquette, PEOPLE SHOULD BE CALLING YOU!!!  I never expect much from anyone to begin with but after texting her 3 times about sending that key back, and she finally mails it, I just put her on the ahole list!  After 14 years with her she did not even send a get well card!  Very classy! You really find people out at a time like this.  Unfortunately it is not always good news.  People act weird about cancer also.  It freaks them out (us too!)!   Your friend, in all fairness, sounds pretty spread thin with taking care of the family and extended family.  I think, even though it has been a let-down, she means well but just does not have the time.  I have a friend like her who is always making offers of assistance/promises she can't keep.  I say let it go.  We all feel let down by one person or another in our lives but, sadly, it is the nature of the struggle we are in. Texas: talk about finding people out?!  Gadzooks!!!!!  First sabotaging your fundraiser?!  Then declaring you well, cleared of bc and perusing your mammo stating you are ok like you made this story up?!  WTH is right and, in fact, I would prefer to buy a different consonant!!  The story is just horrible.  However, the story of the woman who gave up smoking was great!  My friend moved to TN in May and I have sort of inherited a mutual friend and he has been really helpful through this.  He also quit smoking!   I don't even know how people do it anymore- cigs are $10 a pack in CT and if you smoke 2 a day that is $1000 a month!!!  I'd be smoke-free at Neiman Marcus! Lessons learned.....I had to fire my landscaper under the auspices of cutbacks and today I developed a healthy respect for what they do!!!!  I am tired! Your FEARLESS Leader!",

Ladyinbama: I agree about people who talked a good game.  I don't really like pity parties or people lurking about, trying to see if they can be of assistance.  In fact, that drives me crazy!   I have been surprised about people that arrived to help and who have been really good about things.  I hate to admit that *I* have felt uncomfortable going to see people who are sick/are struggling because a lot of times people are not like me and get dreadfully depressed over a bout with their health and, to be quite frank, it can be a real downer.  I volunteered with the elderly for years and would spend time etc.. but, in the end, I burned out.   A lot of them were very miserable about their health and their kids not coming around and I just got really tired of it.  I sometimes think people are weird about things like what we are going through because they don't want to feel down.  I could be wrong but it might motivate some people to practice avoidance at a time like this.  The bottom line, however, is you do find out who your friends are and I was surprised this many people like me!!!!!!! I hope everyone is having a nice day.   Great weather in the northeast this week...unbelievable in fact!

ADA: People, the *reason* W rewrote it is to STOP companies from attempting to ABUSE cancer patients so now companies know if they run afoul of the law, they are going to be sued and the cancer patient is going to win.   Therefore, all you have to do is say you are taking time off as outlined in the ADA and the bigger your company, the better it is for you.  Our country is broke; The Dept of Justice and the EEOC oversee the ADA and that it is upheld.  Well, not only do you win in court, the United States FINES the company in question so for your company to give you trouble about taking time of, which is so effing egregious and disgusting to begin with it makes me sick, site the ADA.  That should shut them up because they know the cost of the lawsuit and the cost of the FINE from the US Dept of Justice is going to SO FAR OUTWEIGH the costs of keeping you on, they have to change their underwear!   HR is not your friend.  They may like you and feel bad about your situation but their job is to try to get rid of you because, bottom line, they are supposed to save the company money.  Do you honestly think the  US Govt wants to pick up your cancer care tab?!!!!!!!!!!!  HELLL NO!!!!!   When it comes to the US GOVT vs. business, the US GOVT WINS!  This is why you all should say a quiet thank you to W.  Also, if we are all good employees and just got sick, who the eff is big business to try give us s*it about taking time off or try to fire you?  Don't sign anything, don't take any sneaky offers from your company and, if all else fails, I am giving the numbers to the Dept of Justice and the EEOC to call.  Office on the Americans with Disabilities Act U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Civil Rights Division Disability Rights Section - NYAV Washington, D.C. 20530 Toll-free number: 1-800-514-0301 (voice) TTY: 1-800-514-0383 Fax: 1-202-307-1198 Web site: http://community.breastcancer.org/AboutUs/Redirect/index?h=http://www.ada.gov&n=Office%20on%20the%20Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act  In the end, the bigger your company is, the more lawyers are salivating over the very notion they will violate ADA because, not only will the case be landmark, it will also be a huge settlement. Don't hesitate to call a lawyer if you need to but, remember, W did not even want these cases going to court so he tightened it up completely so a company would not even bother harrassing a cancer patient about taking time off.  He wanted to make sure there is nothing they could do.  Your income and benefits are also supposed to remain in place.   For now I have to go but I have tons of info on ADA and I will forward it some time this week to the 2 parties in question. It nothing short of sucks that we have to be thinking about this.  In the end, why the hell should we even have to go this far?   It is gross and W saw the abuses and he fixed that once and for all.  Now are you all still thinking he is Mr. Devil, Pro-Big Business??!?!?   Hmmmm.....my information seems to refute that!!!!!!

Good to hear from you.  I am so glad you volunteered at the race.  It was good to be involved and help others in lieu of actually running.  You also make a good point about the millions of people in this world who are having a much more difficult time.  Even something as simple as going to the grocery store can end in a car bomb death in some parts of this world.  We are lucky to live here, in this country, where healthcare is very good and where we have at least a modicum of protection from the very influences that make other countries scary to live in never mind be able to get healthcare.   BC is unfortunate to have but we could live somewhere much worse and still have this....things could definitely be worse.  Then last night when I was watching the Yankees-Texas game, Goeroge W. Bush was in the audience.  No matter how you feel about that man, before he left office he did something absolutely wonderful for cancer patients all across this country to give us protection from workplace mistreatment.  Does anyone know what he did?  Just wondering!  I will post the answer later today!  I was so happy to see him, sitting there enjoying some popcorn.  I am so grateful for what he did for all of us.  Omaz:  I will pick up the book but what do you mean by strengthen?  Is it diet, exercise or both?  If so, does this author advocate weight lifting?  Just wondering. Good day, girls!!!!! Your FEARLESS Leader",

DebJ: your questions are getting specific.  You can TAKE what you need.  That is up to you.  To be quite frank, if you are already asking these questions, you probably suspect there might be a problem.   I would be liberal if what you take; chemo is hard enough and designed to kill off the ever-stealth pre-bc/c cells.   More to this point, and I think it was Wherria who said it last night: cancer loves stress.   Stay as stress-free as possible during chemo for optimal results.   There will be other jobs; there will be other options but you will never get another body so don't bust your hump if you don't have to. Dexamethasone: this stuff makes you wicked hyper!!!  I am more frenetic than usual!  Avoidance techniques: Oddly I was more nervous before my bmx than I am before chemo.  I purposely schedule 20 things to do the day before to keep me busy and not have time to think about it!!!!  Dexamethasone has surely helped me today ;) Mussels: I am true New Englander and I love mussels.  Due to the bmx and the immediate recon and drugs associated to that since late June, I did not have my summer dose of mussels!  Part of the issue was concern over that being perhaps the only fish that could be extracted from BP (!) and sold in the northeast.  Well I took a chance today and purchased mussels.  All I do is steam them but I did have to  question why the heck, the day before chemo, did I decide to eat something I have not eaten in a long time?!   That was a little risky.  Oh well!  What's done is done!  I also had, in the back of my mind, the idea my taste might change with chemo and my little mussels won't taste as good so I decided tonight was the night! Texas: why are you wanting to walk IN THE RAIN!  Our immune systems are a little nowadays and you are trying to open the door to calamity!!!  I am glad someone stopped you!  I added you to the cape list for both forgetting you had cancer until someone asks how you are and NOW for trying to walk on our behalf in the rain!!!!!    Sohard: HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!!!  I will be thinking of you at chemo tomorrow! Finally:  GO GO GO GAGA!!!!!!!!!!   And Eminem!  They just about won all the MTV VMA last night! Dexamethasone is telling me to go to shopping and I must abide!!!  Actually I need Biotene!

Adey: I will totally be there for you on the 20th and as I am no longer the one closing the August chemo parade, I will have to pass the big drum and hat to you so you can come up the rear and close the parade!!!!!!  Glad you have a date. Wherria: I hope your tx today is just LUSCIOUS!!!!!!  I just asked for Vodka with my infusion....I don't have to tell you all the respones!  Last night some joker agressed me with his truck as I was in the crosswalk heading into SUPER WALMART!  In any case, this one is uber busy and the crosswalks are strictly adhered to, as they should be.  The front of his truck got so close to me I called out \"douche bag-you are suppose to wait until we are out of the crosswalk!!\" to the cheer of a few traveling along in the crosswalk with me!  Normally I might be vociferous or not...no way of being sure but I do suspect the steroids are kicking in fast!  This might also be why I am called Your FEARLESS Leader!!!!!!! Omaz: acupuncture is great.  I am glad you are enjoying it!  So perhaps SOMETHING good comes out of something bad?!!  I thank you for your appreciate of the group and I appreciate you guys as well!  We are very supportive and it is nice to have you all to talk with about all of this medical madness! Ginger: I am so sorry to hear you got food poisoning.  It is also so scary because you really don't know what is happening meaning is it SE or what.   I think if it was a restaurant don't hold it against them as it is probably just that your WBC are low and you can't fight off what you normally might.  Surely it is not a good sign either but I would take it in stride.  I sure hope you are feeling better.  Eating out too much, in this economy, especially in the major cities, scares me because so many restaurants are having troubles making it by, my feeling is they might be selling meat etc... that normally would be tossed.  I hate to think that but I have been cautious about eating out these past few years since this massive dip in the econ all except for taking a risk with those mussles last night! OK CHEMO-SABIS>>>MY PERSONAL REQUEST TODAY, OF ALL OF YOU, IS THAT YOU TRY TO PUT A GOOD FACE ON BC AND TRY TO REPRESENT YOURSELVES AS WELL AS YOU CAN SO PEOPLE SEE US AS SURVIVORS AND NOT AS VICTIMS :) Your FEARLESS Leader!",

Sweeney: oddly when I asked my nurse about using left over pain killers from surgery she said yes, go ahead.  They, however, did not give me a prescription for pain killers. Furthermore I was told I could have 1 drink a week?  WHAAA?!  I will just wait until January and make up for lost time one night!!   The point is I was told I could drink. Omaz: nothing says summer like Bud Limes!  Please tell me you were a fan of Tequiza?!  I LOVED that stuff and, some time last year, I was in a corner store in the Boogie Down (Bronx!) and they actually HAD Tequiza!  I think it left the market circa 2006 but I bought it and drank it anyway!!!!  Questions!: Has anyone used 100% Glycerin soap?  Did everyone lose their brows and/or lashes?  Does anyone have 2 scars from their port insertion, one near the upper pectoralis in the center ,and then one near your neck?  I don't remember being cut near my collarbone but there is a mark there now. Is Dexamethasone the steroid that keeps us wired?!  I don't know...all of the sudden so many questions and am very concerned about this additional mark on my neck.  It does not look good.  I think they ran the picc line over my collarbone and that is the problem.   Gadzooks...I want to start chemo Tuesday...ugh!

I just took more steroids so while I have a non-steroidal moment, last night when I laid into that joker at Walmart, usually I am not so crass but vociferous I can be!  In any case, he got what he wanted because he drove his little truck within about 6\" of my shoulder and the roids kicked in.  He was obviously a punk and, sadly, roid rage caused me to give him what he wanted which was a reaction.  What further aggravated me about punk face was he was just arbitrarily parked in front of the store in the crosswalk and as soon as the pack of people got into the walk way he hits the gas.  My remark should have gone unsaid but sometimes we just slip...and give someone what they deserve!! Headwraps, scarves etc... aside from the free stuff I have received, I do like the stuff from TLC.org.  I have gotten 4 hats, 2 scarf hats and 3 plain colored scarves.  It is all good quality and I like the material and colors. Sweeney: good for you on the surreptitious photo taking!  OMG ... a silly story!  When my friend and I were teenagers, like 13-15, we were in NYC a lot.  Well, if we saw a hot guy in like Grand Central, one of us would go stand near him and the other would innocuously snap a pic!!  It was SOOO funny and for those of you who have been in GCT, you know it is wicked easy.  Of course this was 27 years ago so the phone was not an option and, honestly, it was easy with a 35MM as people just thought you were a tourist!  So break out with the hot pics, missy!   Who is your wireless provider for the Iphone in Canada?  BTW, Canada, y'all is GOOD STUFF (Texas!!!!)!!  Ladyinbama: you are 1/3 of the way through and I am 1/6th!!!!!!  PROGRESS, my friend!!!  Thanks for the link also.  Free is always helpful! Texas: yeah...TX weather is a fright!  I am 1/2 Italian and 1/2 Irish and the Irish part of me LOV S the rain!   I would miss WA also.  In CT we get quite the mixed bag not to mention, and most recently making a strong appearance on our weather menu, TORNADOES!  Onemonga: You said, it was about damn time! Wherria: I am glad you are continuing and without the dexamethasone.   I am just glad you decided to continue.  Me, on the other hand, is salivating over my next serving of roids as I have a Weider double pro station in my home gym as well as a flat bench and olympic bar = GOOD STUFF and now that I am AUTHORIZED to take steroids, needless to say, I am going to make hay while the sun shines, Y'ALL!!!!!!!!!!  he he he!!!!! Ok, time to count down to my next roid serving! Happy Trails- Your FEARLESS Leader!",

Sweeney: I am fine but have been on the phone and I realized just this evening that this contributes to DRY MOUTH! Also, that luscious, seductive monster fatigue has me embracing that notion! I took at nap this afternoon. I had more mussels and salad for dinner then 20 minutes on the recumbent bike. I feel ok...just some heartburn (never had this in my life!) but had a little milk, no pills, and am ok. Hopefully can make LGFB tomorrow because have to get Nuelasta anyway so may as well go while I am there! Wherria: you do, undoubtedly, have a lot to deal with. I give you a lot of credit as well because you do seem to hold it down. Do I wish you did not have so much? Absolutely. You are, however, an inspiration. I know...more dubious titles you never wanted!!! Lisaattheshore: my BS said we would talk about the LE sleeve later. I thought, before chemo dragged out to December, I would be going to TN for Thanksgiving and traveling for Christmas as well but I clearly doubt that will be happening. For some reason I felt more comfortable having the sleeve if, forbid, I was on a flight and something were to happen, I would prefer to be wearing the sleeve but I guess bridges to cross! Hair for the birds? Does that help them cozy up their nests? Interesting! I have to read up on that! Lisasinglem: you will be back to doing those hills at your previous pace. It just takes time. I give you credit for going out to walk. I am on the tread and recumbent of upright bike. I wanted to buy an Arc Trainer this year but that is $5K better left unspent right now! My tread is also needing some attention so I will replace that soon. In any case: people. I know exactly what you mean. I think I told you I worked in theater when I was young. I think it is a challenging job to have while going through this type of situation. I think a therapist is a great idea. Don't hesitate...we have all been there and this is an emotional rollercoaster of a ride we are on. Don't forget...talk to the therapist about something to calm you. I know that seems to be the last thing you want because you feel you want to have reactions and know you are in tune with your life but sometimes taking something to help you through a frustrating evening etc... you can, in essence, blame your lack of emotion on something else, ya know? It sort of lets you off the hook for a while. I know this sounds convoluted...perhaps it will make sense to you when you read it!  Don't forget you also had a really nice experience over the weekend when one of our own stopped you to cheer you on!  This trip is a mixed bag.  Do whatever to help you get through.  Lisaattheshore: yes, the \"A\" can affect the heart. Consequently, if anyone has \"SE\" questions, I have all my materials handy as I just received them a few days ago. They are comprehensive lists so, any questions, fire away! Ladyinbama: what an adorable avatar! I think we all look like kids again. Lady-do I take Claritin before Neulasta or right after? Any recommendations? No, I am not looking for a replacement for medical advice and I am fully aware you are not a doctor!!!!! Mmahle: Good to hear from you again. I was wondering about your daughter. I am glad you checked in although I wish the news was better. I am glad your mom is coming to help. Another adorable avatar! GOOD STUFF! That is a great pic. Keep us posted, please. Sweeney: whatever get together/vacation our group plans, you must come! You are a freakin' crack-up! Hoping I am not vomiting on my perky little cosmetician! They actually do our make-up there?! I thought just gave us stuff! Ok...I will keep an open mind! Let the emotions flow, girls! Share it here. This is one heck of a trip and we share the GOOD and we share the BAD. We are a crew...this means we support one another. Sweet dreams to all- I remain... Your FEARLESS Leader!!!!",

Speaking of LGFB, the class was cancelled today because the cosmetitician was hospitalized.  The other problem: inner city, big hospital, humongous parking garage was FULL!  As I drove around the streets being told from one parking lot attendant to another, I could not park *there* by the time I got in I would have been 1 hour late anyway :(  One parking valet told me 'parking here is only for oncologic' and I explained I AM oncologic and he said I would have to find somewhere else to park and plead my case to the parking authority or pay him $10 to go in for a 5 minute shot!!!!!!  Of course, even if LGFB was still on, I would not have been going in over an hour late!  The hospital gave me a free pass for Mr-You-Don't-Look-Oncologic and apologized that if they had some prior warning, they would have had other plans for us.  On top of it, he told me the big garage is not safe and why they let so many people park in there is beyond him!!!!!!!  Thanks for armageddon talk, pal!!!!!

I woke up biting the insides of my mouth...it was really weird...obviously a stress reaction to this stuff. I am glad you are on such a nice high! I am down from the roids gladly. It is nice to sleep again. Somanyblessings: I am sorry you are having such a hard time. I am very glad you have a good support system around you. Iowa: question: I am definitely in the \u2018nothing tastes good' camp already. Obviously there is going to be weight loss. Do you know if they will stop us from getting chemo if weight-loss is an issue? I had not heard of that but thought I would ask while we are on the subject. Sweeney: sorry you are not feeling well. I was NOT too well yesterday. This is super gross!!!!!!! Oh girls...what did we get ourselves into!? I tease these 2 guys at work that I \"caught\" bc from them as I was fine before we all sat together! One must make light. I have to say, and if I did not before, I give it up so much to you and all of you who are raising children and going through this tremendous 2-3 months of txs. What a challenge and what super women you are. Sadly I have no clue how I would fare under such circumstances. I am sure it would not be as good as y'all have handled it! Lisasinglem: I am so happy you are taking the night off. I know it must break your heart but the rest is such a requirement. I hope you get to feeling better very soon. Wherria: ultrasound because did not want RADS exposure of a mammo! Sure enough, it was found through ultrasound and confirmed by mammo and biopsy. First mammo 38, second one, begrudgingly, at 40. Someone said it: we are a young group = early detection. Good stuff ;) UPDATING: I will update the lists later today. Adey: GOOD LUCK TOMORROW   A few things: 5 more of these?! I am fading fast!!!! I feel like I sound like such a baby compared to you guys but I am surprised by this stuff! I am still working out (if 20 minutes on the recumbent bike is a workout!) and lifting weights but nothing crazy. Just trying to keep on. I remember my father go so sick from chemo he fell on the floor in his bedroom. I was 27 years old at the time and I was in from NYC for the weekend. I will never forget that so I WORK my legs every, every day. Alas I am convinced we are all heroes in some way and I think we need one, big COLLECTIVE CAPE given to the entire LOT of us this week! Girls, I hope you all are doing well-",

Honestly, I like my docs but the sooner I don't have to see any of them anymore, the better!!!! I can't wait to put this behind me. I think, based on a friend who had c that I work with, it is all bloodwork post-chemo and if they find something, they call you. I do believe the flups with oncs are quarterly. I cannot wait until the only doc I see is my GP, who I love dearly, and who I miss but with all these other doc visits, I want to avoid going to yet another doc's office at all costs. He is the reason why my bc was ever found. He would not take no for an answer regarding my wanting to avoid a mammogram! Kimmie: my heart breaks for you. This disease, if it does not kill you, it makes you stronger. It seems like everything can totally come undone and then come right back together all at once. You have so much to deal with teaching and homework..it is a lot. A real lot when you are dealing with chemo as well. I give you a lot of credit but more importantly I wish you some peace. I had the heartburn business also. I never had heartburn in my life, btw, but did take Zegrid OTC and it worked perfect. Also, cold milk worked great. I hope you feel better soon. Why is it I feel like us, the women on the boards who have bc, and the people that treat us are on another planet?! Today I was talking to one of the nurses about how long I can/should take Claritin after Neulasta to manage bone pain and she looked at me and said she never heard such a thing. I told her myself and all the girls who have bc swear by Zyrtec and Claritin etc.. to alleviate Neulasta bone pain and she said no. She said she heard of people taking it for sniffles and runny/watery eyes but never to alleviate bone pain?! Are we creating the equivalent of urban myths on these boards or is the medical community out-of-touch and/or unwilling to acknowledge our unorthodox practices? It is weird. Are there any other eye-talians (!)/folks that like a good red sauce out there?! they told me I could not eat sauce or that I should avoid it. Well, I promise you, there is one thing I make very well and do like to make is sauce. I make chicken cacciatore, manicotti, stuffed shells, lasagna, veg lasagna, ravioli etc.. and I did not want to give it up. Tonight I decided, as this is day 9 including the day of tx, I would try some sauce. I am wondering if you all have eaten sauce and, if so, if you had any SEs. I know we are all different etc.. but was just wondering. JSW: call Ben and Jerry's and tell them you have bc, are on chemo and the only thing you can eat is their ice cream! You might an opp to do a commercial OR a case in the mail!?! Who knows?! Everyone wants to give to/sponsor bc in some way. You might get your own flavor! KatherineNaomi: that was a great poem, thank you. BTW, and sadly, the odds on bc are now 1 in 8. Scary. Calamtykel: they warned me of the potential for sternum pain. I have not had it but they did tell me ribs, sternum, hips and long bones of legs and arms. They repeated that sternum thing, however. I am sorry you are having so much pain. Claritin does not help you? I took the 24 hour dose and I have not had any pain at all. Sweeney: that is the important stuff: butter tarts and girl forts! I am looking forward your later posts ;)",

The cycle and chemo pause: that is what I mean about being like Lance Armstrong! Mine always came and went without notice, 3 days/4 max my entire life. Thursday, or 2 days after the first tx, and here it comes and it just stopped yesterday. I thought ONE of the gifts was that it would stop!! Nothing stops....I had to go to the dark side yesterday: IMMODIUM!!!!!!! That steak was all kinds of wrong...I should have never done that. Speaking of which... Meat: I eat all kinds of fish: swordfish, tuna steak, scallops, shrimp, filet of sole, mussels, steamers, clams ...basically if I can broil it, I eat it! Twenty years ago I was having a fast food burger with my friend and found a BONE in it. I swore off all fast food then. I might grab a salad now or fries here and there but no sandwiches. Chicken I do eat but the read meat I swore off some 20+ years ago and never went back. I do garden burgers and pasta also. Lots of vegetables in the form of salads, stir fry etc... but, much like Calamtykel, I find that entire red meat industry cause for concern! Scrabble!!!!! What is going on?! Good to hear from you. I just got my first bloodwork results and all my numbers were good. I would definitely take the neulasta. I got away with very little pain this last time but who knows? That can definitely change with future injections but the benefits are very much worth it. The Claritin seems to really work. I did the 24 hour non-drowsy and take it around 3 in the afternoon starting the day of injection (but a lot of people say to start the day before) and all went well. Good luck. Emotions: this is quite a ride. Lisaattheshore is right: who knows...is it chemo, pms, stress, hormones gone wild on chemo?! Too hard to figure but it does wreak havoc....I don't need to my embarrassing behavior and subsequent overshare a la Walmart, do it?! Iowasue: for the record, I am very jealous of your avatar! Lisasinglem: I talked to my bs about a hysterectomy (as I am not using the equipment!) and she said I should not have one. I thought with ER/PR+ a hysterectomy would make sense because I would shut the hormone making/attracting factory. Does this make sense? Is my thinking off on this one? I mean why not shut it down to stop it? I guess I don't know enough. I am going to ask my onc but if anyone has any ideas on this, please let me know. Kimmie: don't get me started on odors! I am brushing 3 times a day and am constantly armed with gum, mints and deodorant!!! Oh yeah...another bonus....I STILL get the cycle and now I also get an occasional hot flash!! Great!! Rachel: I am Irish and Italian...fatty desserts are everywhere!!!!! I will, however, have to try a buttertart or beavertail (they never screw up the sweet stuff, do they?!) when I am in Montreal next spring. I hope you have a lovely time at the Hotel Chemo today! We really can check out anytime we would like but we can never leave! This entire experience will be with us forever! Tossing back birthdays: Onemonga: I say party this year and next year! Keep partying, woman! Yesterday is history and tomorrow is a mystery: enjoy today, the PRESENT that it is J Calamtykel: you are correct about the amino acids being the catalyst for building muscle. Muscles, after all, are jackets for our bones. The red meat, which you and I have both appropriately categorized as uber-gross (!), is where a lot of the essential nutrients we need to \"expodite\" that process are found. You and I both know you can get all this stuff from veggies but you would have to eat mountains. Egg white omelets do the same thing for the most part. They are jammed packed with protein and add a little cheese, they become a huge nutritional bargain. Like I said, I saw the cow video in college (about the entire COW industry) and that did it for me. Atypical of the caliber in the industry: just before my bmx I went to dinner with a friend and her 2 friends, one of which works on a farm. He told a tale of beating a cow to death with a shovel on a DAIRY farm (no FDA approved slaughterhouse there) and proceeded to go home, with the cow's brain, and cook it. I got up and quietly told him to keep his sick, eff stories to himself, dropped 50 on the table and walked out. THIS is the sick caliber of individual working on farms. I don't blame you for having your own chickens! At least you can control what is going in and what you are eating. Salmon farms: those are ok actually. Just like tilapia farms, it is a slightly more healthy way of controlling our food sources. Tilapia will eat \"anything\" left to their own devices. What the FDA is after now, and wanting labeled, is a new form of genetically engineered salmon. This is the petri-dish, non-fish origin, strain that is currently being sold and consumed in this country without a label. Of course, any of you that eat fast food chicken, you all know there is a similar form of \"protein paste\" type of chicken out there. The other is, and I think was KFC, who gave chickens hormones to create THREE breasts per bird. Not joking. Then there was BT Corn and how Taco Bell decided to buy it and serve it to us. Forget drugs, make sure your kids don't eat at Taco Bell!!!! I am going to stop now! Ginger: it is way ok to feel bad anytime!!! We are dotted lines to each other so come here, share, we will toss you the life raft and then when I am similarly situated and jump overboard (I mean fall...!) you can toss me the raft!!!! Such is life on the SS-BC! CKPTRY: I hardly ever watch O'Reilly but at 3AM this morning he was ranting about the Governor's race in NY and how the schools are a mess. Our schools, in large part, are a disaster. When I look at all those devils in Los Angeles who robbed so much all I see are kids sharing books in the inner-city schools so those poor excuses for human beings could steal. I hope they do not give you too much of a hard time today. Of all the things they want to take away but something that is so upsetting to deal with and, of all things, in front of the class. I don't have kids but I do have a number of nieces and nephews and I have seen all kinds of stuff over the years with the schools. I will definitely be sending you good vibes today. Texas: you're back!!!!! We missed y'all!!! That is so cute about the baldness and sisters! So cute. You seem to be in better spirits and STAY that way! GIRLS...give yourselves love today!!!!!!!!!!  Even if it cucumbers over your eyes for 10 minutes while listening to the 3 Tenors (1994) and reflecting on NOTHING! 　 　 　 　 　 　",

Dr. Weiss: I am sure you all viewed her message.  It is a heartfelt, very positive message.  On a very deep and convoluted level, I find incomprehensible that she had to get this.   I know her mother had it but in the big land of \"why,\" this looms large for me.  Why any of us but in particular because losing her mother to this was tantamount to starting this site which, like several of you have said, is such a wonderful place to come and unload when this whole experience just gets too much.  No one deserves this disease and it's victims are a macabre mix.  I am so grateful for this site.  I am just so glad she started this. Ginger: eating and partying and drinking etc... obviously does not cause cancer because....KEITH RICHARDS does not have bc!!!!!!   Poor Keith...I do give him a hard time!  I am with Lisa on the ROTFLMAO on that one!   Cancer gets started because either a cell called for a protein delivery and it did not show up OR the protein truck arrived and the cell refused delivery.  That is it in a very simplistic sentence.  How this equates to what we eat and drink, or like someone has deluded themselves into thinking they can avoid cancer through what they eat and drink needs to talk to Martina Navratolova who was dxd in March with bc or Lance Armstrong who fell victim to testicular, brain and I beileve lung cancer all at once.   These are 2 lifelong athletes who arguably have led pretty healthy lives...go figure. Rachel:  I am sorry you are not having a good time of things this past week.  I know, I go back a week from tomorrow and will undoubtedly be similarly situated next week.  WOE IS US!   I hope you feel much better as the week goes on.  SEs go away!  Poor, poor Beavertail!

I could not imagine what was going on.   Now, in retrospect, I realize my body was busy using all of my resources trying to fight cancer and working out or anything else I did that required me to use my energy doing something else caused me to just collapse.   I was almost relieved to find out I had bc but I knew something was wrong and I knew it was systemic.  There was no way at 39 years old I was feeling so awful...my joints hurt, I did not even want to get out of bed in the morning, I was just completely not myself.  As it turns out, I had 2.5 cms showing and over 3 hiding, or pre-cancerous cells.  That is a lot of cancer going on!  It was sucking my energy dry.  Not for nothing but since bmx I feel soooo much better and, I know you all will declare me crazy crackers on this one, but since my first chemo, after the crawl out of the sludge (Adey!), I feel even better.  Which brings me to my next point: Steroids: Kel, they are GRRRRRREAT!!!!!!!!   Just like Frosted Flakes only tastier!!!!!!!  They do keep us hovering over the chemo-induced rip tide coursing through our veins as well as giving us energy and masking a bunch of other stuff !!! Sterloids are good stuff indeed!! JSW and Sweeney: I wondered where you 2 had gone!  I figured JSW got her ice cream endorsement and Buttertart and Beavertail *worked* this past weekend!!!!!!!   JSW-glad you had a non-bc weekend; they are good for the soul ;)    Sweeney- glad you are feeling better.  I must say, you quite succinctly hit the nail on the head again with your mellifluous meandering on the topic close to our hearts.  It was very well put.  I also love the fact that we so unabashedly share here.  It is so good for our souls!   The body does know.  It tells us but we have to be available to listen. Zenith: I am so glad you found your own little rescue dog!   Good for you ;)   I just love animals.  Just this morning my \"rescued\" cat woke me up by standing on my back (stomach sleeper!) and purring in my ear and why?  Because she wanted me to get up and open her window!!!!!! Sohardbnme: where have you gone?  We have not heard from you in weeks it seems.  I hope you are well.  Come back and give us an update, woman! Adey: yes, sludge!  Gross, right?!   Yuckamonga!   I am so glad you have emerged!  My next trip to the luck factory (!!!!) is one week from today! Good day, girls!   Look in the mirror and smile at yourselves today....it is fun!  It makes you feel good!!!!",

I was worried when I read it because clinical depression is very real and very, very dangerous.  I also embrace the idea that we all unabashedly share on this thread and I did not want anyone to feel isolated or judged when attempting to share about the sadness that can engulf someone going through the very problems we are dealing with in going through this battle w/bc and chemo etc... Most unfortunately I think Lisaattheshore meant that if someone tells their doctor they are sad is encouraged to get on a med of some sort and that perhaps doctors are trying to anesthetize even a modicum of sadness with a pill.  I think she meant that just because someone is a little sad that might be a healthy response to what they are going through and not require a pill to fix it.  It is a sensitive topic though and we have to caution ourselves against commenting about it.  There is nothing wrong with using pills,into perpetuity, if it makes you feel better. Be that as it may, however, I am glad you got MAD!   Good for you!  Now that is a healthy response!   Thanks to the pharmaceutical industry and major strides in understanding depression, it is very treatable and can very much be managed and reversed.  I am glad you are doing better these days.  You went through quite a bit and I am very glad you got treatment and are doing better now.  I want everyone to feel very free to post whatever they are going through here and not feel they might be being judged.  Like I always say, we are women which means we are only hormones and water and anything can happen!  Lets be better to each other than we are to ourselves.  Finally today I am supposed to go to LGFB but we are having a tropical storm and I wonder if I am going to make it!",

So if anyone was wondering how I take bc in such stride, it is almost like a non-event compared to the years prior!   Life can be hard and throw you some serious curves.  Sometimes the curves are too sharp and if you don't let someone help you, things could get worse.  Take what you need to get yourself through a tough time and don't you, not even for one second, feel ashamed because you could not biologically get yourself through.   If your car battery fails do you let your car sit there until the battery fixes itself or do you jump start it?  Exactly.  The body needs a jump start sometimes too. Feel free to discuss everything and anything here and don't ever feel like someone is going to judge you because that will not happen again.  Be well, Kelly, and do whatever you need to in order to feel as good as you can every day as we fight this draining battle together.   ",

I would think it is scar tissue but it keeps growing. This is the backbone of my concern. Ckptry: It is not on the (potential) leaking side. It is on the side where I had cancer previously. I am supposed to see him with every visit. This is a teaching hospital and he is a professor as well as my oncologist. I totally respect his academic commitments and the fact that he elected oncology as his profession. I just need to see him once in a while and this now, with this lump growing, is one of those times. They said he might be here this afternoon and perhaps he can come in and see me. I hate to be a needy jerk b/c, quite frankly, his practice nurse is excellent but, as I stated, she is quite slight! I really need someone who has the strength to press through the TE to feel this thing. Funny-before bc NEVER DID a self exam and now I am doing them! Go figure! On the hair affair, I am just like you in that I am riddled with trepidation I might get a big cut and have to go to the ER, get an infection, have my chemo schedule messed up and end up a mess! I want to go to the scalp. I am actually enjoying the process of \"starting over\" with hair and having 100% new growth. I know we get cuts but we never start over. I am looking forward to what comes out!!! Thanks for everything, girls. Have a nice day, be good to yourselves, don't let anything stress you and I hope everyone GETS OVER THEIR COLDS!!!!! Drink a lot of OJ women and get that vitamin C! Because protein is an important component of good nutrition, this section gives tips on increasing foods like cheese (calcium also), ice cream (calcium also), milk (calcium also), eggs, peanut butter and others that can help you get the protein your diet needs during chemotherapy This is Lizzy reporting live from chemo for all my super chemosabes!!",

It think you might be having a combination of things.  One of my wigs cost $500 and, to be honest, it feels better on my head than does the less expensive one; even with bc there is no reprieve to the old adage 'you pay for what you get!'   I think the head, neck and even hands, if you were touching the hair on the hat etc..., and if what happened on your head, neck and hands all coincided to use of the new hat w/hair, those symptoms could be related to the synthetic hat w/hair.  Some of that synthetic hair is made of not-so-innocuous material.  The capillaries around your eyes is scary.  I know taxotere played around with my vision and made it blurry which scared me.  Depending on your timeline of when these showed up, and if some of it was after that hat hair, stop using the hat hair and, like Omaz mentioned, Zyrtect or Claritin has seemed to help a lot of us in ways that we are not sure about but I have not had Neulasta pain and allergic reactions.  I also had no allergies before and I don't know but I just finished tx #2 yesterday and who knows what I will be saying by mid-November!!!!  Best of luck and come back when you know/find out more as it helps all of us.  IowaSue: After years of having a 3 day, no pain cycle, I was complaining I am on my cycle like Lance Armstrong now!   My nurse told me it will happen again!  I had it for about 10 days after tx #1.  As for your shaving advice, thank for the info on shaving.   I appreciate it.  I think I am going to go to #1 this week.  It sounds like a lovely weekend.  1000+ kids for treats???  Where will you all sleep as you will need to be able to store the 100+ bags of candy!!!!  I hope you have a fab weekend.  CT weather has been rainy and cold but it was long overdue.  I sometimes don't even make it through my local news as I get tired of hearing how many people were shot in New Haven, how many Yale kids were mugged and now some New Haven cops tasered a Yale student in a nightclub this weekend and someone filmed it with their phone.   The battle has just begun over police brutality.  For this reason I don't even usually make it to the weather!   I am going to have to start watching the Hartford news!   Good day to all of you and I hope it is lovely!",

I hope you continue on an upward slope there, woman! Oh, btw, thought of you last night: I am the last house on a dead end and there is a cut-through the woods to get to the adjacent street. As I am driving up to my house I notice a guy walking with a \"miners light\" on his head. I wondered what he was doing. I failed to leave the lights on in front of my house so by the time I was getting out of my car, he was down by the end of my driveway. It was so dark I was a little spooked but he quickly explained he lived on the adjacent street and was heading for the cut-through to go back home as he was searching for a CHICKEN that escaped the coop! I told him, of course, I would keep an eye out but I thought of you nonetheless! I never did see that chicken last night. It seems awfully macabre to mention this now but I sure hope your chicken soup comes out good! Wherria: I am glad the 4th tx is over. Did you find out anymore about getting an additional 2? I am surely to early in the process for nail issues but they did tell me the potential is there. They said they can turn black, split and fall off. Mine are still growing for reasons unknown. They did tell me if the nails are going to come out, sadly there is no way to avoid or remedy the situation. My nails never grew and were always weak until chemo. That has been weird. If you have had gynecological issues before, perhaps this is a cyst. The ultrasound should clear that up. Sad about the rectal but we all have to eventually! How long have the lumps been under your arms? Has anyone suggested they might be connected to lymph edema? I have not been diagnosed with lymphedema. Perhaps you might be able to work the new \"oven mitt\" into a Halloween costume! You are going through a lot yourself and with your parents being so far away and you, while needing to take care of yourself, want to, of course, be with them is tough. I am sorry you seem to be being bombarded with challenges these days. The Chicago Marathon! That is great news. Just being there working should keep your spirits high and keep you involved. I will be hoping the SE don't keep you in. I wish you much luck and {{{big hugs}} that you are able to go and make it through. Even if you can't make the whole day just go and do whatever you can, for as long as you can. I am sure any assistance would be appreciated. I hope it all goes well and you have a good weekend. Ginger: I hope you get to feeling better as well. The sleeplessness is an albatross. Nothing worse. When I get on these steroids it seems like I sleep for 2 hours and am up for 2 to 3 and that is the way it goes. JSW: off to chemo land today for some more AC! I hope you are doing well as the week progresses and as we all distance ourselves from the last one and get closer to the end. Lisasinglem and to all the others on breathing issues: I HATE IT! Yesterday even walking around the hospital I noticed I was getting a little winded. I notice it other times as well upon exertion that normally causes no challenge and now I feel winded. It really makes you feel like you are slipping away I don't love it. Is this your last TCH? I hope all goes well. Onemonga: Halladay...unbelievable! I could not help but think the pitcher really went out of his way to clinch it for him in that last throw to 1st! Amazing! Go Yanks! I am so happy. That was a nail biter...I had to channel flip like I was watching a horror movie! Bring on that vaccine, man! A friend was asking me the other day why I did not OPT for the chemo pill!!!!!!! Do I really have to explain it was not an ONCOLOGICAL MENU OPTION for me?!?!?! No crying here but, like my onc said yesterday, chemo does some funky things to the body! Wigs: when I found out I had cancer 7 months ago I stopped highlighting and because my hair is long and I was just going through the surgeries and millions of appointments, I spent most of the summer in a baseball cap, pretty plain, my hair back and enjoying the wind while I drove to my million appointments without having to spit my hair out of my mouth! Now the wig is here and I wear it but others like it too! I don't like that part of it. These ladies said to me at the hospital, on the elevator, how nice my hair was and I explained I am a total fraud, that it used to look like this until bc blah blah and they were stunned. It was an expensive wig so it should look good but at the same time I do feel like such a fraud! In any case, there I am getting breathless, walking the roughly ½ to ¾ mile hike back to my car and talking to them. I was too embarrassed to tell them I was getting winded so I just kept trying to keep up the chatting! Not my finest few minutes, girls! Good day to you all and I sure hope we all are triumphant today in our ability to effectively manage this madness we are in!",

If I were you, I would definitely do the following: call the oncs office and explain, keep a journal of temps and try to remember how long this has been going on as preamble in the journal and then, should the onc think you need some more attention and want to see you, simply request if you could go to a mediquick/ER setting where you will only have to wait once and can quickly get a chest xray to examine your lungs immediately.  I know it is raining and raw but it is imperative you bundle up and get some attention.  Have you been on antibiotics at all?  Also, if you go to CVS or somewhere to get a paper mask to protect yourself from encountering any other germs while you are out, don't hesitate.   You really need to protect yourself, especially if the doc agrees that the ER is the place to go, from further exposure. I am very concerned about you and will be sending you positive vibes and best wishes for immediate treatment of this.  Please don't hesitate, however, and I am being a bit dramatic but this is because they really drove it into me yesterday to quickly discuss and seek treatment for any lung related issues.  Best of luck and please keep us posted.",

Our spirit, and don't ask me how it all happened, is a resounding attestment to the will of women at large. If someone on our thread, who regularly posts has a bad time, we expect to hear from them and will support our fellow weather girl through that time It is arbitrarily going \"off thread/site\" where hearing the worst of the worst is possible and this is what I mean about watching what you read. For reasons unknown, some people cannot see the good in anything and like my father used to say, give a drinker a reason to drink and they will become Irish on St. Pats, so goes the give a complainer a reason to complain and they will. There are also opposites of the spectrum that can be tempered by a good group of \"weather girls.\" Me, for instance, had on my blinders until chemo handed my ass to me! Others had an anticipation of a bit more of a rough time and we all came together, as true \"weather girls\" do, and supported them to take it as it comes. This is the support that is so profound with us. I do think there was a modicum of serendipity at work when we all came together. We put our common cause before our interest in picking about personalities, we console each other, we listen and we support. We are \"weather girls\" and where life may take us to places we have never been before, we will always see it as a challenge and not an opportunity to complain. If you look for the good, you will find it and if you look for the bad, you too shall find that. Just watch what you treat your eyes to in this world because it can, in the end, rent space in your head. Put on a smile and put the \"no vacancy\" sign on your forehead. Enough said!",

I also just did a basic google search on levaquin and bone pain and got several links talking about severe muscle weakness, bone pain and joint pain on Levaquin. ",

Not more exercise, not eating differently, not having kids, not *not* having kids, not using different hair color, avoiding fried foods - this is life, as it were, and we did not make a single pro-bc choice...it just happens. An ex of mine reached out to me recently to let me know he has intestinal cancer. He just called me a few nights ago to tell me he feels he just made some bad decisions. I reminded him what I just told you. Do you honestly think if someone told you eating a Ring Ding was going to cause bc you would have still eaten it?!! Don't hold yourselves responsible for a dubious twist of fate. Recently I just told a friend if I had a choice between me having bc and someone else, I would choose me. I think I am better equipped to handle this challenge than a lot of people I know. Some of us have to get cancer, period. It is the only way more can be learned about the disease. They say a risk factor is not having kids but 95% of you all have kids. They say to exercise and I have been a member of Bally's Total Fitness since 1989 and actually do USE the gyms rather than just carry the card! Don't blame yourselves...you did nothing to bring this on. I really don't even know if they will ever find out what causes cancer because I think for each person it is a different set of factors making the cause damn near impossible to find. Personally, I remember sitting on Metro North at 6AM and my bra broke. I had to do the whole day, happy hour, dinner with friends and a return home at about 9:30PM to find my breast had started to bleed in the exact place where I would get bc only 5 year later as my toilet paper solution had failed at some point in the night no doubt under the auspices of liquid anesthesia! Bottom line is no one knows what causes it so don't drive yourselves crazy, lamenting perfectly innocuous choices and holding yourselves responsible. That is KANGAROO court if I ever heard of a version! JSW: I believe you can get through anything! Good to hear from you. Fatigue: to all of you talking about this, I am wiped out over the tiniest of events. I keep pushing but I am so disgusted with my body pushing back and saying no. I am very afraid, as my next one marks the ½ way mark, and these SEs being cumulative, what January and beyond is going to look like relative to being post-chemo and dealing with that lingering fatigue. I just hope it only lingers and eventually goes. Lisasinglem: I agree, and concur, on the thought of emerging as a beautiful butterfly when this is over!  Good stuff! Aveno fragrance free: Omaz...thank you, thank you! You made my life so easy....skidded into Walgreens and grabbed it...wonderful stuff! Cigarette smoke: smells, smells, smells. I am sorry to any of you that might smoke but I cannot stand the smell and I noticed now, with the help of my new BFF chemo (!), I have a heightened awareness. I was stuck in traffic due to a little road work. All of the sudden I smell it and am looking around to see if it is someone in a car near me....no one. The smell was so gross it was driving me crazy. I looked into the parking lot of an adjacent strip mall only to notice a young man on his phone, SMOKING, roughly 100+ feet away!!!!! It smelled like he was in my backseat!! I was getting so sick from the odor. Thank you chemo! Bula hats: I found the greatest hat that outlines my face and has material that comes down over my ears...love Bula hats! This will be my new *wig* going forward!!!!!! Sptmm: funny you mention youth and their outlook. I was in a large crafts store chain yesterday and there was a woman there with her teenage daughters. They must have been 14 or 15. In any case, something got them laughing and they just got into a laughing jag. I started laughing, too, because everything is funny to me and I still carry with me ruminations of my youth and, perhaps you all could have figured this out by now, my single parent father had his HANDS FULL with everything-is-funny over here!!!!! In any case, their mother asked me NOT to encourage them. I told her she SHOULD encourage them to enjoy their youth. All I could think was why the hell is it a problem that they were laughing so much?! Don't you dare tell me what to do either, Ms. Misery! My brother has told me on more than one occasion every wants to be me and why? Because I say what people are thinking! In any case, my tart response to wicked wanda, their mom, had them laughing all the more! Let the kids be kids...let them laugh, man! Calamtykel: If you can get through the Levaquin without an allergic reaction, that bodes very well for you. Apparently it is one of a new, and very potent, line of antibiotics designed to kill super bugs that are not responding to all of the others. I was sort of sad to find that out when I had my allergic reaction. I am, however, very, very, very happy you are feeling better. I am also a huge fan of hunters caps! Why am I posting at 4:30AM?! Because sauna body over here decided to turn up the heat while I slept, had to get up, turn OFF my little space heater (yeah...what was I thinking!??!!!!!!), remove covers, open window, turn on fan...and repeat process of trying to get some sleep! As it takes me about 45 minutes to cool down from a \"hot flash\" that wakes me, I figured I would write to the weather girls about the middle of the night heat wave in CT!!!!! Talk to y'all later!",

I am editing this post because I just had an epiphany!  I wonder if it is possible Levaquin works somewhat like Neulasta in an attempt to increase wbc?   No clue but it might have some validity...?

I am going to be on long term disability now which is helpful and my benefits are still in place. In the end, I want to align myself with a company that stands by it's employees. Can you imagine how stunned I was when a regional director from ACS told me what a bad reputation for mistreatment of cancer patients my company has?!?!? I thought they just did not like me!!!!!! Glad your tag sale was a big success. I hope you are feeling better since that Levaquin/Taxotere monsoon of last week! Texas: that is so incredibly clever that the apartment complex is smart enough to barter for security. That is excellent for you and them. I hope you get it. I have family and friends in law enforcement and actually a friend works detail for Obama so, more to this point, I know the SWAT team is not easy to make so congratulations to your husband as well.

Sweeney: I, too, feel like I can lay down and sleep most anywhere. The fatigue, they warned me with TAC, is bad and cumulative. I figure by tx 6 I will become like my cat sleeping 23 hours a day! Tattoos: I would never get a real one either but, because of the no-blood pressure/blood draw on the left since they removed so many nodes, I have been considering getting one on my left arm b/c forbid I am in a car accident and rushed into the hospital. In an emergency situation they are not going to read our medical file and certainly, if I am traveling, there is no way anyone would know. I am honestly thinking of getting a pink bc ribbon with no blood pressure/no blood draws this arm...I know it sounds extreme but better safe than sorry. JSW and Onemonga: happy, happy, happy birthday....belated that is! 2 oncologists: I saw 2...the first wanted to put me on TCH...WHAAAAAT? TCH is not even appropriate for my type of cancer.

You are a smart woman and I am sure you are correct about ego and associated nonsense with that first onc. There is no way she should be putting up such a fight with you about additional txs. It doesn't make any sense. I am glad you went back to an onc you had visited before and you are going to get the additional 2 txs. It is absolutely imperative you feel you did everything you could NOW while this situation can be potentially eradicated. Potentially is the key word and we have to do all we can now to maximize our chances of a long life. You did the right thing and I give you a lot of credit for going after what you want especially because it means further discomfort. As for the runny nose and eyes, dry nose and eyes, I have all of that. Texas: they say everything happens for a reason and although you lament the adoption falling through, your plate is full now with your own dx and trying to care for yourself and your family. It is very altruistic wanting to adopt a child but at this point, focusing on yourself and your family is probably best. When you are beyond chemo and getting better, then you can revisit the adoption process. It is a wonderful thing to adopt a child and give them a loving home.

Too bad but it's the life you lead you're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need Though you can see when you're wrong, you know You can't always see when you're right. you're right You've got your passion, you've got your pride but don't you know that only fools are satisfied? Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize, Vienna waits for you? Slow down, you crazy child and take the phone off the hook and disappear for awhile it's all right, you can afford to lose a day or two When will you realize,..Vienna waits for you? And you know that when the truth is told that you can get what you want or you can just get old You're gonna kick off before you even get half through Why don't you realize,.

I was working with a woman who had 2 kids in hockey and they LOVED that song.  They played it in the locker room after every game!   We can definitely add that to the \"Weather Girls\" soundtrack!

I had no idea. On Yale, both you and Kel are going to smaller facilities. I am sure I am trapped in the behemoth hospital system, no doubt. I do feel like I am at Red Lobster! That was an appropriate analogy from your situation that I can apply to mine! In fact, just yesterday I told them, as they can't honor an appointment, why they don't just have a deli number system. I don't think they loved me yesterday and TOO BAD! Wherria: good luck on #5 and I think the silly, sexy photo is a great gift for Christmas! The camera...nice gift, woman!

IowaSue: that is great that you have so much flexibility at your job. I love working with, through volunteering, the elderly. On the lump, I found a mass, not even a lump, under the breast where I had bc. They checked it and said they felt it was scar tissue. Bottom line is no one has magic fingers so I would like to think it is scar tissue but mine was gross-aggressive. It totally took over my sentinel node and there was no evidence of node left...it was just entirely bc and it \"leaked\" from the node also. Quite frankly, many, many lumps are benign anyway. Did you have mx, bmx or lump? Sorry, I can't keep track of all of us! I would say if it is the unaffected breast, and y had a bmx, you probably have nothing to worry about. If, however, you had a lumpectomy or mx, then it makes the situation a little different. Mind you, this is no replacement for medical advice as I am NOT a doctor but I am trying to help you sort through this, one bc patient to another. I hope this helps. Coffee: did anyone give this up during chemo? Everything tastes so gross that I gave it up back in September. Just wondering. Calamtykel: so glad your onc let you slide on the neulasta shot! Good for you ;) That is scary that you had trouble with your port. I am glad they got it worked out but that is a shame. Just what we need, right? One more scary thing. I am glad, after an initial scare, it all worked out. Omaz: with the reduced chemo, take a wait-and-see. Perhaps your neuropathy will not worsen and maybe it will even go away a bit. You are going to have to really wait until the next one is over. I am hoping you can get through 6 with the reduction but what I hope and what reality is are often times 2 very different things. I just hope the next one goes well. Let's discuss this more a few days after the next one and see how you are feeling. For now I would take great comfort in the fact they are reducing the amount. This should negate some of the deleterious effects you were experiencing to an extent. Hang in there, woman! Better days are coming ;) Sptmm and Adey: yes, itchy boobs are a text book sign. The only problem is so, so many things can make our boobs itch, I think drs like to discount the potential for that to be a sign of bc. If you google symptoms of bc, itchy boobs is always on the list. Adey you are right and the docs are wary! Mommichelle: You are totally justified in what and how you feel. This is a long, arduous process and it does leave us all feeling mugged a bit. Robbed of our longevity, our hair, our emotional balance, our muscle strength and, most importantly, our ability to deal with every day situations in a balanced, healthy way. Of course your DH wanted to give you a break and, as men are always good on the grill, they gravitate to their comfort zone when it comes to whipping up a meal! He meant well, I am sure. He probably just did not want you to cook. It is entirely feasible you will live to 80. We are on the cutting edge of new developments in the treatment of bc and all cancers for that matter. I think all of us have very good chances of long lives. They say a large percentage is your mental state as it affects your ability to heal. I know you are down today but I hope you overcome this and get back to a positive state. I know it is way hard but I urge you to try. Also, you will have your old life back. Life is all about balance and water finds it's own level. Bit by bit, after chemo, you will move back to your normal life as you will return to that balance. It all works out especially if you want it to. There are some things we cannot control so it is important to stay focused on today, what you can control today and forget trying to predict the future because we all suck at that!!!!!! BTW, I have been mean before....they are resilient, they get over it and don't forget, you do have bc...that is sort of carte blanche to be a little mean, to vent and to let it all out ;) Ladyinbama and Wherria...where are you?! Hope you both are well. Roids are still working...going to watch House and Dancing with the NON-Stars!!!!!",

That is fantastic news. As for unpacking, you have been through so much since you arrived in your new home. That will come in time. Perhaps you are starting to get ready to do it. A little at a time. One box a day and in a month you will have 30 less boxes to look at! I wish you the best with your taxol txs. Calamtykel: Since I have been on taxotere since the beginning and, yes, everything tastes awful, I bought a few plastic 20 oz tumblers at Target and I leave 6 pennies on my counter in front of a cup. I mix 16 ozs of water w/ 3-4 ozs of cranberry or cran-raspberry etc... . I would avoid lemon and/or orange juice because of acid. Each time I fill my cup, with a goal of 6 per day, is drop a penny in the cup. The goal is to have all the pennies gone by the end of the day...not always the case! The key is 2 straws, no ice. This is working for me. The final step is to plug my nose, not with fingers but just breath, so I can't taste. Just my trick...hope it helps. As for what I wear to chemo, and because I get 3 each time, I am usually hot so I found some super light material t-shirts this summer or I wear a tank and a shirt or light jacket. I do still use my post-bmx tanks also. I always look like \"heat miser\" when I am leaving the center.

I failed to give out candy as I was too afraid of being exposed to germs, cold and finally my pillow called my head!   Now my boyfriend gets to take 5 lbs of candy home!  Good for him...I don't like (this has been edited for Texas = quasi-!!) mediocre chocolate!  I like dark Godiva w/raspberry etc.. I don't waste my time with Reese's etc...!     Being approached for money am I the only one?  At gas stations, at grocery stores, outside the mall...what the hell?  I am so tired of it.  I know times are tough but I really snapped at someone tonight.  I mean, I don't feel well, I just got a boat load of TAC on Tuesday, I just wanted some Ginger Ale and I went to a convenience store.  I am coming out and some woman standing near a car with some loser guy in it says \"excuse me, ma'am\" and I said \"WHAT?\" and she quickly recoiled and said \"nevermind\" and I said \"right.\"  I feel like saying 'I have bc, I am on chemo, I am single, I live in CT, I am not feeling well and guess what?  Other people are really sick, drug addicts, so get lost.'   It is always these gas stations by the highway.   People like us did NOTHING to get this sick and others do everything to try to take their freakin lives every day with stupid drugs and I am getting approached for money?   It sickens me.  There is a 1% chance that was just someone down on their luck tonight and a 99% chance it was addicts looking for a few bucks.  I just don't have the patience for it these days and I have to temper my reactions as these people are sick in the head.   Ugh...people. I hope you all had a nice Halloween weekend....I slept mine away...it is the easiest way to ignore chemo! ",

I am sure the 2 year mark is causing the (mind-induced) cramps. Please keep us posted and good vibes, woman! Calamtykel: I am so done with Ebay and Paypal. I have bunches of Coach bags and I have been selling them. I don't need them anymore and, to be quite frank, all I really carry is a wallet. I have a Coach wallet I use but I don't need these bags. Sure enough Paypal decided to put some 14 day hold on funds. I will never sell again on Ebay. Paypal is nefarious and although that was the first time I had trouble with them, I have heard horror stories. I also had a problem with Ebay last year. I am just done with them. No more! Also, and just so you know, that Paypal \"be prompt\" criteria is a crock of shit from the depths of hell!! It is called Paypal wants to make money trading funds in the overnight market and the best way to do that is to hold our funds for an inordinate period of time. I cannot believe the government has not sought to control them by calling them a bank. I hate to say it but this one time, I would much rather pay the gov to stick it to Paypal! Tex: I cannot believe that med cost you $120. Just awful. Speaking of cost of meds, I got this card in the mail today from \"Healthcare Alliance\" and it was some RX relief card. On my way to putting it in the garbage (because I am never eligible for any discount ever, in my entire life, so I knew it was crap), I decided to look them up. Apparently it is a scam and what happens when you use this \"discount\" card, you might actually end up paying more for your meds if you use it b/c there is some small transaction fee built in. The greed and grotesque abuse of the citizens of this country, under the aegis of capitalism, just sickens me. I am sure I told you all I watch \"Shark Tank\" on ABC every week and \"Mr. Wonderful\" always says \"it is always about money, all of the time.\" He is 100% correct. Even this disease, riddled with people just trying to make maximum profit off of it. It is gross! CAMPING! It has been years and years! I hope you have fun! The $95 consult was put through my dental insurance, of course, but what a pathetic sack he was, too. I sincerely hope all the money grubbing doctors, upon death, go to a special part of hell together where they get to hear intervals of nails on a chalkboard collated with listening to Rebecca Black's \"Friday!!!!\" and the only way to make it stop is to PAY with money they don't have and will never have access to!!!!!!!!     Ginger: snow?! I am so glad CT had 1 snowstorm in the past 12 months and that was in October. I really need to move a bit South of here as I am really growing to hate cold weather. Omaz: I have not been changed from Tamoxifen even though I have not had my cycle in almost 2 years. I am jealous as some of you actually do receive \"healthcare\" out there! Must be nice! Your meds are switched, your \"linings\" are checked for thickening, you have doctors that actually do the freakin' job according to the oath they took!   I hope you all have a lovely night! Carry on my lovely warriors!",

Grocery shopping: I am going back to the way I lived in Manhattan which is no grocery shopping!  It is a waste.   I don't eat anything that is here so I am just going to shop and eat daily or every 2 days.  Nothing else is working and I am throwing out so much stuff.   A waste.  Yes, I do try to bring it to food pantries etc.. but some stuff I have just had to toss.  It is a travesty. Something we all need to know and can learn from: this is a really sad story but something we all must be aware of.   A young couple was found dead in their home because apparently, either by a pet or some other odd occurrence, their electronic car start was activated while they slept.  Of course they had an attached garage and the car sat, running, and the carbon monoxide built up and killed them both.   Two things here: for those of you with attached garages and automatic start, you might want to rethink leaving the auto-start cars garaged and additionally you want to make sure you have a working carbon monoxide monitor.  School: I am sending out apps for nursing school this weekend. More to this point, I purchased a bunch of teaching tools and guides for anatomy, physiology, chemistry and math to brush up on these subject as my old a$$ has long since filed all this information!  I am home-schooling myself as I believe I will be starting school next September when I am finished with all this bc stuff and give myself a few months in the summer to rejoice!   In any case, this is where I have been.  It actually feels good to be learning again and it is helping me with chemo brain!

A friend visited this weekend and when she saw those purple flowers she remarked how they are so pretty and they smell so pretty. Sure enough, she was right! My mother used to garden and love to plant flowers and all of that stuff. As a child I would help her but as an adult, I have zero interest! Those flowers are in the front of the house and clearly perennial work of someone so inclined! I just love them and they are beautiful. Ginger: when you find that perfect climate, I will be going with you! I can't believe you got snow. It was so nice last night, watching Idol and collated with the Yanks with all the windows open! It was just beautiful. It is set to get more seasonable here next week meaning 50s and 60s but this has been such a treat. You are correct, the D3 number is 1100-1200. I am definitely going to start taking it. I was also watching Dr. Oz today and they said L-Tyrosine is a fine replacement for synthroid. I am not going to go off of synthroid but I am going to take L-Tyrosine in conjunction with synthroid and am hoping it will jump start this thing! I have to say, my gyn said she really feels like a \"co\" doctor w/Dr. Oz as her phone rings off the wall the day after he covers something in her wheelhouse and I understand that could be frustrating but I still love him! Tex: did you make the gyn appt yet?! After reading Trudeau's book (not done yet) I am only pretty sure I am going to be giving up milk! On that note I am only pretty sure I am going to be giving up everything! Can you believe Walmart is going to put out a \"PINK SLIME-FREE\" meat option?! I can't stand beef, I don't like the cows are treated, I don't like eating 4000 hormones and drugs with a piece of meat etc... so it has zero effect on me but I cannot believe that Walmart is going to give the \"slime-free\" option. They are just effin gross, disgusting capitalists killing everyone in their wake with their nasty cheap food. Trudeau said eat 4 pieces of organic fruit, 2 salads (organic of course!) and juice every day for optimal health. I am going to go with it. Makes my life easy...one trip to Whole Foods a week and I will order organic chicken which I receive by FedEx. Trudeau is making my life very easy! As for Ecuador, one friend bought a place and another went on a 2 month vaca there earlier this year and loved it. I would get an apartment there. It is a beautiful, up-and-comer with gorgeous, affordable beachfront housing. Sounds good to me! Have a lovely evening !",

Calamtykel: I am sure you already looked up some info on bok choy but, and just so you know, the white part can be eaten as well.  It takes, of course, longer to cook than the leaves so you just the white parts 3 or 4 minutes before you add the leaves.   Right now I am making grilled asparagus!  It is my fav recipe and I love asparagus.  Marinate the asparagus with 3 tbsp balsamic, the juice of 1 lemon, 2 tbsp of olive oil and 1-2 tbsp of lite soy sauce.   Leave it in the fridge for 30+ minutes, spray the grill w/cooking spray and cook it right on the grill.  It is delicious!  I am actually doing it under the broiler tonight which is also an option.  The temps are going from 60 during the day to 30 at night!  I am not going outside to grill!  ",

Sptmm: am I ever loving this weather! I know it is going to get cool again this week but I must say, every window open today, went out and got an hour of vitamin D and all is well with the world!!!!!! Deb, is it the freakiest thing we are dealing with brush fires?! I am used to watching this on CNN, not live! Tex: I am still upset about that gyn. If I was out of law school, under the auspices of bar reciprocity, I could probably get hooked up in TX in no time flat and I would be suing the shit out of them for you. I can't stand that they treated you like that. As for the scar, I am with Ginger: I have all kinds of lumps and bumps along my scars and don't forget, I still have a humongous mass in my left breast pocket! Even with the PET scan showing uptake in that breast where the cancer was before, I am still not totally devastated, scared about recurrence. I sort of just take it as it comes. When I was recently examined the doc exclaimed \"what is that?!\" Um, I just don't know!! Don't worry, everything should be fine. Please, if your dh is in Federal employ, consider moving to a more metropolitan area. Don't forget, my brother lives in TX so don't feel bad that I am coming down on the state! FL and TX, IMO, are both like foreign countries at times and the craziest crap happens in both places. Tex, I just think, relative to procuring medical treatment, it would be within your best interests to peace out of there!  Although I do know, and especially with kids, this is much, much easier said than done ;)  Ginger: Hope you are doing well today! Omaz: how are you doing these days? The shorefront parks in CT were packed today! No charge for entrance before Memorial Day! With gas now approaching $5 per gallon in several parts of the state, I think people made the most of no-fee trips to the state parks! Happy trails, all!  Just found my \"The Three Tenors\" dvd and am going to pop it in! ",

Of course, the grocery store douses it with water all day so when I get it home I have to shake out all that water and it is like shaking an \"SOS\" pompom! I then cut some up and make a salad accompanied by arugula and chard. That kale is just a wonderful, wonderful treat! I can just feel it's rough, robust nature tracking through my intestines! Ok, my \"Ode to Kale\" is done! Calamtykel and Ckptry: I find the way it is written confusing. Additionally, what the heck does \"neu\" stand for? In any case, whatever it all means, I think there is shreds of positivity in it for all of us, if not today, then perhaps in the near future! Sptmm: congratulations on the 5K! I did not realize there was a Revlon NYC run. Is it a bc run? Just wondering. IN any case, the weather turned out great! Nice day. Tex: I had a boss at Bank of America who would say to all the financial consultants, when we found ourselves out, partying after hours, if he would be seeing all of us at the gym the next day! He always told me he worked out all the time because he loved to eat! He was very handsome and in really good shape and was overall just a really nice, decent guy. He really protected and helped us along and I can safely say he was one of the most decent people I ever worked for. In any case, I remember his words when I think of you Zumba-ing your way through yet another cake this week!!!! Oh, why can't our bodies just successfully digest cake without us having to run 20 miles to burn it off! Another guy I went out with some years back used to joke when we were out partying it up until the wee hours that he would have to go to the gym for 3 hours the next day to sweat it off! The moral: enjoy your cake and remember when you are working it off that you have tons and tons of company! All week a local news station is running stories, sponsored by Yale, on strides that have been made in cancer R&D. Each night it is going to be a new development so I will be sure to make notes and report back! I know this disease is an albatross and can be upsetting but I find that it is somewhat exhilarating to watch new developments unfold! I just find it really exciting and I don't think I would feel the same if I did not have the disease.   In any case, with developments in mind, we should all remain hopeful for the future. Golden Girls house here we come! I am wiped out! BTW, \"Hunger Games\" was rather mediocre. Is it just me or do movies generally suck these days? It would have to be compelling for me to go to a movie going forward. I just find them disappointing. I don't know if it is me, if movies are for the youth or if the general consensus among moviegoers of all ages is they just aren't like they used to be? I would rather go get rush tickets at a rep theater any day. My brother who is 5 years older just loves, loves the movies. He always tries to remind me not to anticipate the predictability but rather just let the movie take me where it will. I try but I remain disappointed!!!! Night all-",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2012 06:08AM - edited Apr 25, 2012 06:08AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! Ok, so I am addicted to Dr. Oz!!!!! As you all know, I have a thyroid problem and it has been not doing so well since chemo. My synthroid was increased but it so slow to come back etc... In any case, I am watching him just now and it turns out that cabbage, kale, broccoli, peaches and a few others all have \"goiterogens.\" What these do is work *against* the thyroid by sucking up the iodine which is what the thyroid needs to live! I was stunned...here I am chowing up this kale, broccoli, cabbage and I love peaches and NONE of it is good for me!!! Here is the solution: he said to steam for 10 minutes any of those foods and you will negate the \"iodine eating properties\" of those vegetables! Sometimes I feel like a nutritional buffoon when I watch his show! I mean I could not be doing anything more wrong than eating broccoli, kale and cabbage raw! Also, and oddly enough, he says it is imperative to get \"Vitamin D\" to help the sluggish thyroid. Between the speculation about D and it's connection to bc and now for me, the thyroid connection, it seems there is something to it all. He was not talking to us bc girls when he discusses this but it helps us anyway: parabens can be found in shampoo, conditioner, soaps, lotions etc... and it might say \"methylparabens\" or some other kind of parabens but if you see that word, parabens, it is a synthetic product which causes estrogen activity. Therefore when you put it on your skin, wash your hair, it is getting into your body and igniting the estrogen machine! What Dr. Oz suggested, and he was talking to women regarding their menstrual cycle, was progesterone cream to balance out the estrogen. Of course, we would have to consult docs etc... but I found it very interesting that the \"parabens\" in almost every lotion, are estrogen igniters. Again, I don't know why she swallowed the fly, I guess she will die! It is just amazing, and perhaps I am strictly for myself here, how much we \"do not\" know! My final analysis: chow up all the Vitamin D you can get! Oh, and one more thing: as for the thyroid business, he said even though he is a western-trained doctor this would not have occurred to him necessarily but if you hum and \"tap\" your thyroid it motivates the thyroid to make and secrete more hormone! Every day is a health education with the magical Dr. Oz!! If anyone knows those with thyroid problems, pass this information on, please!  It can really benefit someone.  Tex: type your response in Word and then cut-n-paste as I have lost so many posts because of the \"disappearing\" trick in the post box! \"The Arctic\" is Imax about the polar bears and Meryl Streep narrated. I am going to check it out in Norwalk in a few weeks. My friend took her daughter, who is 5, to \"Chimpanzee\" and that child LOVED that movie! Glad you had a good time. I will be VERY PATIENTLY AWAITING the results of your scans!   More to this point, I will be waiting with you ;)  Back to Dr. Oz! I actually, as often as possible, sit in front of my computer and make notes in OneNote as I watch Dr. Oz and then I review my notes later! I really feel like I am becoming a nutritionist under his tutelage!! Good day, girls!",

I also looked at my mullet in the mirror this morning and am thinking perhaps around July might be time for another cut! Only my second since chemo. I can't believe how it is growing in, though, thick and curly. It was always both of those but, quite frankly, in the year leading up to the bc dx, I am only pretty sure it was getting thinner. That could have been age, hashimoto's or it could have, in some way, been related to the latent bc. Well, it is back and healthier than ever! I have a friend from NYC, not on these boards, who has bc and was lamenting the last strand falling out recently. I reminder her we are lucky to get a chance to grow all of hair over again, in the middle of our lives, and thereby get a new, healthier batch! Sweeney: I think of you often. I am glad you are doing well. I understand moving on and not being around these boards so much, which is very healthy in and of itself, but just the same, know you are in my thoughts ;) Rachel: that story about your aunt was absolutely startling. I cannot believe that after 20 years, it came back quite quick and took her life. That is outrageous. A reminder of how insidious this disease can be. I find it incomprehensible she went 20 years with nothing and then it came back like that. A reminder we are never really free of this albatross but I still have hope they will develop a remedy, a \"cancer\" shot etc... before I expire! I sincerely believe the \"shot\" etc.. is going to come from the US simply b/c the costs of dealing with cancer care are so egregiously prohibitive, they will soon have no choice!! YAY! Calamtykel: we are all very much in the same boat . Between my itchy breast, pain in my liver and now my thyroid feels \"big,\" I immediately go \"there\" as well. \"There\" sucks!!!!! If anyone is interested,  here is a link to an article on how the cancer drug shortages continue and how this might impact research: www.medscape.com/viewarticle/7...  Off to the eye doc and chops doc!

Sue: very good news!  What a relief.  Glad to hear. Calamtykel: I believe pre-existing conditions are not a state but rather federal mandate and regulated by the fed.  I believe if the company has more than 100 employees they cannot pre-exist you.   This is way too much for you to have to deal with.  So unfortunate that there was a change.  A few years ago I was really thinking about moving to Ireland as I have dual citizenship.  I really wish I did.   I met someone from across the pond on these boards and her experience, socialized as it is, is fine  Things are going along well for her.  This healthcare situation in this country is just nerve-wracking.   When I get these bills I am stunned.  I am only pretty sure you are going to be fine.   Certainly it would be nice if they got back to your husband about a raise but in this precarious economy, and with your health issues, I would totally not push on that one.   These are indeed scary times.  I am with you on the tires only I am going for 4!   And 650 on the snowblower and now a letter from the pharma about Emend and they don't want more info as to why I need it.   Long/short is instead of a 75 copay I will go to 300 if we can't get this worked out with faxing of forms etc... Unbelievable.   I really don't think you have to worry about being pre-existed.   My heart goes out to you.  It is just one thing after another these days.

Actually, I did not know about it until you mentioned it and then she contacted me seemingly w/in hours of you mentioning it! She told me of all the details but I just could not do it this year. On that damn thyroid, I am on 175 mcgs of synthroid as it is and when Dr. Oz suggested we \"tap\" the thyroid while humming as a holistic approach to its under activity, I did that and this is when I noticed it getting \"bigger.\" This means that the Dr. Oz holistic approach must work but, in some way, waking up my thyroid with that tapping enlarged it. I stopped doing the tapping. I have way, way too much to think about with surgery coming up, the mass in my chest feels like it is getting bigger and I don't need anything compromising my throat space heading into this. I will explore \"tapping\" when I am surgery-free....if ever!!!!!!! Sweeney: we ALL wanted to marry George Michaels!!!!!!! OMG...his smile was clearly sponsored by General Electric! So handsome but such is the case with a lot, not all, but a lot of homosexual men. I guess I kind of suspected he was gay but who knew?! Who knew?! OMG... I just saw a friend at the mall and she and I were reminiscing about how one day she called me and said \"Liz, I just saw Tracy Chapped-lips (Chapman) downtown on a moped by the library!!!!!\" It was just hysterical! Such were my teenage years. I drove my high school a few days back and nothing has changed. A lot of good memories there. I grew up in a small town in CT where nothing ever changes and the town looks as bucolic and serene as ever. It was a good place to grow up and also a place where kids can still walk around by themselves and it is just a safe place. I do feel old, however, especially when my friend told me her dd is graduating from our old HS heading to Dartmouth in August!!!!!! Geesh...the years, they are a flyin!! Off to run errands...

Did you talk to the intake rep at CTCA about your plan to pursue local chemo? I would just softly encourage you to consider going to CTCA now as they might have something special and that which you won't find elsewhere and they *definitely* have the chemo you are about to get.  Also, for each infusion, they bring you to OK and you stay there through your chemo tx.  I am pretty sure they continue to help with travel if you go there for chemo, further testing & txs etc...  I know because you have a family this take some coordinating and perhaps it is not feasible right now but, again, just trying to \"softly\" encourage you ;) Sweeney: I have my celebrity crushes of which Adam Levine (Shelton's co-host on \"The Voice\") and Colin Farrell (long, long term interest...!) but what I like about Shelton is he is cute, he is tall and he is full of piss and vinegar! First time I ever saw him was on \"Chelsea Lately\" and, as all men do, he had to protect himself from the attack! All I know is he did not take any crap from her and it was at that point I decided I really liked the whole package with him! As for Colin Farrell, I was rather inebriated with my boyfriend on the Upper E Side one wonderful Spring evening my very Irish boyfriend and I fell upon Colin Farrell! IN a pub no less and apparently the boyfriend knew him from the Muthaland!!! All I can tell you is we both spoke wicked fast (friends say I get faster and more succinct with liquor!) and he was even hotter in person!!! I wanted my boyfriend to go a-w-a-y!!! Good times! I hate to be a bit of a bummer, as you all know that is not in my DNA (!), but for all of you that know you had to \"Fight for Your Right to Party,\" that there would be \"No Sleep Til' Brooklyn,\" and how we all learned about a thing called \"Brass Monkey,\" I lament the passing of the now late, great Adam \"MCA\" Yauch from the \"Beastie Boys.\" Yes, luscious cancer claimed yet another life. Of course, he was only 5 years old than I and with growing up on their music, this was kind of upsetting news. It seems like yesterday I was rockin' out to \"No Sleep Til Brooklyn.\" I will continue to rock out to the Beasties music! Funny story: One summer in high school I was hired by a convenience store. The guy that trained me was out of his mind. He kept going to the bathroom. Well, as my 8 hour training shift went on, and the smoke billowed from under the bathroom door, I realized he was smoking things in that bathroom! I think he was doing other things in there as well. By the first ½ hour with this whacko, even at the tender young age of 17, I knew for sure I was not going to work in that place and that that this would be my first and last day there! In any case, sure enough he takes out his \"boom box(NOTE to Tex: check Smithsonian to better understand this reference!!!)\" and pops in the \"Beastie Boys!\" Now \"Brass Monkey\" comes on and he calls the package store across the street to tell them he was sending a mule (ME!) to pick up a bottle of Brass Monkey!! He thought we should celebrate my first day by drinking on the job! Of course, at 17, partying occupied 90% of my agenda (the remaining 10% was sleep!), so I decided it was a great idea! We drank and trained and passed that beautiful summer afternoon like 2 teenagers enjoying some irresponsible good times...oh, wait, he was ***26***! He also thought we should physically celebrate our union!! That, my friends, was on a long list of things that was *never* going to happen! Not to mention the \"legal\" hurdles! That is my Brass Monkey story! Oh-almost forgot the most embarrassing part!!! The kid my from Japanese class parents owned the package store!!! He was in there stocking shelves and knowing full well I was under age, and giggling away, I didn't know what to say! Of course they sold it to me because it was for what could probably be deemed their best customer, liquor head across the street, so I marched out and Anthony and I kept our secret!! Of course, he told everyone when we got back to school that I was scoring Brass Monkey at 2 in the afternoon and clearly this was a sign I would be a politician some day!!! Well, I am helping a friend who is in school finish writing a paper today so will be at my computer most of the day. I hope you all have a good weekend- Happy trails, girls",

On the new look of the site, were you all surprised when it said there are 112K members? I really thought we had to be in the 1/2 mil plus range by now. I thought that number was a wee bit low.

I really love the new layout and the improvements to the site. BTW, that was an innovative response to your eyes and post-chemo debilitation: books on CD!!! Good answer!!! Ginger: I really think it is imperative I do start to organize a national, or perhaps continental (Sweeney!) volunteer group. I know there must be hundreds of thousands of women around this country who would be willing to help out a fellow bc sister in need. I have been vacillating whether to limit volunteers to just bc women or open it up? I really would prefer it just be bc women. Let me know what you all think. Sweeney: I seriously think these docs ardently try to compartmentalize cancer like it affects nothing else! It is such a ridiculous joke. For example, when I discussed with one of my \"doctors\" recently about bc spreading to necrotic tissue in the pocket, I was told that bc would *not* spread to that \"kind\" of tissue?! WT and a you know the 3rd letter I want to use!!  You walk away from some of these meetings wondering when cancer became so non-invasive, innocuous and that which does not affect eyes, other tissue etc.... They are all FULL OF IT as bc and chemo affect all our systems and there is no disputing that. Let me tell you, it is not healthcare Xmas either! This disease and its txs save lives but they do affect other systems and not in a beneficial way.  The best thing that happened is I have been able to grow new and healthier hair in the middle of my life! I know it grows and we cut and we keep growing it new but we all really started over, from scratch!  It has got be a bit healthier than others!!!  I know, I am grasping here!

It is suspected it was because their home had been foreclosed on and recently sold. There was a neighbor on the news going on about the injustice and how it is a sign of how our society is such a mess. What I don't understand is why not, as a neighbor, in that posh community reach out and see if they could help?  I mean I am talking about a part of this state where even saltbox homes go for in excess of $500k. I just stopped to see a friend in Stamford yesterday and sure enough Trump put a huge condo building and these \"studios\" are going for $500K each. I don't know, it is just sometimes I can't help but wonder how history will regard the times we are living in. Calamtykel: these sentiments clearly lead me right into the awful story of the woman with bc who cannot afford her meds. You are right, why are we drenched in a sea of pink when a bc victim cannot even buy her meds. At some point people must stop hawking their friends for money to support them for this or that run and start putting it into an account where you can use it to help a friend w/bc. There is so much graft regarding the funds raised for this disease. I think I mentioned on this thread before a woman I worked with who had 3 kids and a loser husband who was threatening to leave her b/c she had cancer etc... and she was having so much trouble financially on top of that. She filled out probably 10 forms and had a series of phone interviews all trying to score some financial help for her meds and all she got was, not joking, like $10 a month. I think we all should just say \"screw it\" with giving all the money to these dreadfully mismanaged \"cancer\" organizations and start something called \"open book.\" For instance, if I give $50 to whatever, my name goes on a list of people that gave and then \"how\" my money was spent is recorded as well. There is no transparency and a lot of thieving I believe. Lady: your IPOD?! If you notice your couch boogying, you know what is going on!!!! It is amazing how much we have come to depend on our electronics! Before my last surgery I was warned about bringing valuables and how if I did and they went missing the hospital was not responsible. All I could think was how was I going to live without my phone?! Two things they mentioned that day: cancer patients are sick and when hospitalized are tired etc... so they fall asleep with their phones and then the sheets get changed and the phone goes to the laundry....right! Yale does have in-room safes and it is the first hospital I have seen with in-room safes. That was a great planning idea. That still does not help the \"fell asleep\" with the phone! Now I have this old, crappy MP3 player I take with me to the hospital for surgery etc... In any case, I am glad you replaced your Ipod so quickly! Also, I lost some of my favorites. Sadly I don't know what they were. I am sure glad you hunted us down again, though! Ginger: I can't say I feel too much different but I so agree with you on the fact that, yes, I am glad to be alive but please stop minimizing the SEs. CT State Trooper pulled over a motorist, who turned out to be a fireman, b/c he tripped their \"radiation\" detection equipment! The news is raving about how this means the detection equipment is so great. All I could think was all us bc girls and all our radiation txs, PET scans are radioactive glucose etc... but now I know why they gave me some \"official\" document after the PET scan. They told me it was to show that I had radiation. Ah...so that was what that was for! Hope everyone has a good weekend and Ginger gets a nice tan!!!!!!",

That is funny that you knew you left us all hanging with that glasses thing!! Even I was going way out there, searching for what it meant!!! Glad you had some fun...at our expense! Rachel: So sorry to hear about your friend. This is our lot in life now. I just don't get it and it all seems so damn random and tiresome at that. I wish your friend the best. It is also nice that you have a local group of bc ladies to lunch with. CT is rather small and has really high numbers of bc \"victims\" but there is not much cohesiveness at least that I have found. I met one woman at LGFB who wanted to keep in touch and she was just so miserable. It was sad. I did email her a few times but she never got back to me. I would have gone ahead and had lunch with her and tried to support her. She was probably too depressed to keep in touch. I am the polar opposite of sad and miserable but I totally understand how this disease can land someone there. All we can do is support each other. That is all we can do. Sweeney: I just checked out that website! GOOD STUFF INDEED! Thank you! I am still a huge fan of \"Living Arts\" AM/PM yoga. They are only 20 minutes and most recently I purchased \"Yoga for Relaxation and Meditation\" also with Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden. It is an excellent workout. I also have \"Yoga for Beginners\" (Patricia Walden) and it is 1 hour long. I actually still do it on occasion even though I am certainly not a \"beginner.\" I just think yoga is yoga and whether I am doing a yoga workout for beginners or whatever, I still get a yoga workout. My fav is Bikram yoga. Nice hot room, generally 105 degrees and 40% humidity. That is a good workout. Ginger: I thought of you today! There I was wandering around and actually bought a rose bush! It is just a baby and I have to plant it. I don't know why I did it. I have one already but I just wanted another one. I was thinking about some window boxes. This is really new for me as I am usually not all about the flowers and gardening etc... I shall see if I have any success. I was really getting brave, too, as I saw some seeds for planting some cucumbers and some other vegetables. I am not quite there yet, plus my groundhogs will eat it all (I don't care!), but it is something I am considering. All new for me! I am glad you have had some nice weather and are enjoying your dgd and dd! Good times ;) As for tuna casserole, never was a fan! It was punishment when my mother made it when I was young! It is enjoyed by many, however! Well, girls, I must say I am grateful for all of you and I hope you all have sweet dreams and may the force be with you!!! OMG...speaking of \"force\" I found Wonder Woman on Twitter!!!!!!! So exciting! Of course, I sent her the \"omg, I can't believe it is WW\" tweet and she probably summarily blocked me! It was so exciting to find Lynda Carter on Twitter! She was the hero of my adolescence and really shaped a generation of women. Love her!",

Lady: I am so glad you are doing well!  As for working, did you ever consider volunteering?  I loved, and for years did, volunteer with the elderly!  I just love them.  It was so much fun.  The hard part---they \"go\" eventually.   Just before bc I lost a lady I just loved.  It was hard.  Since bc I have not been able to but at some point, I do intend to volunteer with them again.  I helped with all the medicare/caid paperwork and took them shopping etc...  It was fun ;) I would also volunteer with animals.  I tried on a number of occassions with the local dog pound.  It turned out it was just some people looking to collect animals, like the pound was their home, on the municipal dime! I have done Habitat for Humanity about 10 times.  We have built houses in socioeconomically depressed areas, cleaned up parks, cleaned up empty lots, picked up furniture etc.... Habitat is a great program. Ginger: yes, I don't think women without ovaries need get estrogen levels checked.  I think the estrogen level checking is for women who were not menopausal going into bc but who still have ovaries. On that note, the tests the women in the above outlined category need are estrogen, FSH and LH.  The results of these tests will determine if one is in chemo-induced menopause or not.  I also now would very much like to know, perhaps annually, where my estrogen level is so as to establish the efficacy of tamoxifen.

This diet also calls for eating as much of it as possible, every day.   The first day all you have is cantaloupe and soup.  I could easily have cantaloupe and this soup every other day in perpetuity!

Sptmm: I knew you were going to be the first deviant to break from the Saint Francis Hospital soup recipe and go ahead and use FRESH green beans!!!! Is your crock pot the size of a Fiat?!?! You must have cut the recipe in 1/2 . My sauce stock pot was filled to the brim. In any case, I like zucchini as well but would most likely add it ½ way through cooking b/c it gets so soggy. I am just glad you liked it. I was having trouble finding a good vegetable soup recipe and not only is that one good, it has the added bonus of \"cleansing\" properties!!!!! Adey: that was an absolutely poignant story, thank you. What beautiful photos. Well, so there I was at the mall and this \"man/boy\" behind me was chatting with me. He was undoubtedly what I might call a \"thug\" but it is, of course, this Yankee gear I wear that gets the boys talking! In any case, he remarked something about my chest and how he likes women w/small ones!!!!! Not joking! I tell him that this look has been sponsored by donating my humongous ones to bc and he reaches in the \"front\" of his pants and now I am ready to die...he pulls out his key ring that he has attached to his belt loop and attached to that ring, and tucked inside his pants, is about a 2\" long pink ribbon...his mom died of bc  It was sad. He gave me a hug. This poor, poor young man.  None of you told me how you already saw the YouTube video I provided of \"surprised kitty\" so perhaps I should be thanking you all! I still it is one of the cutest videos ever! Good day- ",

It is a shame but everywhere we go it seems stuff is getting stolen.  I even feel bad that a clerk at a local convenience store was shot and killed *after* he handed over the money to the robber.  It is so sick, desperate times, people are going crazy.   There was another spooky, theft story  in the news this week in CT.  Apparently someone was stalking people at a local popular grocery store chain, following them home and robbing them at gun point.  Of course the victims were elderly.  In any case, glad you are ok but I sure am sorry the bracelet is gone.  It is heartbreaking, the little things we covet, being taken from us.   Rachel: I think that shampoo is working!!!!  We will have \"manes\" by Xmas!!!!! Happy Canada Day to both of you!   BTW- I don't know if anyone on this thread likes \"hot\" stuff but I have concocted a spicy barbecue sauce = sriracha, Sweet Baby Ray's, a little sugar and (freshly squeezed) lime juice.  Mix those 4 ingredients together until you get a flavor you like and then use it like a bbq sauce on the grill....so darn good!  ",

Tex: to actually get the foot bridges established what the underwriting was about was issuing municipal bonds to finance this.  This means the people of the county could buy bonds that pay tax-free interest, and that which are largely considered to be very, very safe investment, to manage the deer and, more importantly, the tick population.  One night I was cruising the parkway and had been w/friends in Goshen drinking homemade wine so you get the idea!  In any case, I have good peripheral and with my windows down and roof panel open, music blaring, it suddenly dawned on me that deer was *not* supposed to be there!!!  It was running along side my car as I passed it, for a few seconds, we were synchronous!  It was scary!  The worst thing about the deer problem here is no one cleans them up from the side of the road and we are a wealthy, wealthy state so it is not like people are going out to collect the carcass as a food source.  I am sure that goes on but not as much as would be helpful.

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2012 03:37PM - edited Jul 6, 2012 04:01PM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors- I have a question for all you pet lovers out there: First, let me preface this with the fact that I have found a sizeable lump, among all those \"supposed\" necrotic tissue lumps, about 1/10th of an inch from where the cancer was before.  Of course, with the PET results, I am concerned ... but this is kind of a new lump.  In any case, I won't know about any of this stuff until all this mess is removed in a few weeks.  Now, having said that, back to the pet behavior! My cat has been freaking me out over the past 3 to 4 weeks.  She will NOT leave my side.  I am in my office, she is laying next to my desk chair (almost to the point where I nearly hit her before I realized this was a new thing that she was not going to stop), I am in the kitchen, she is there, I am in the back yard, she is in the window, I am in the living room, she laying right next to me.  She has never gone in the basement in this house, ever, as I think a dog stayed down there at some point in the history of this home.  Well, I do all kinds of industrial art and a lot of it is working with metal, spray painting etc... and I have an area in the basement where I work on this stuff.  Sure enough, she came to the basement and was lying right next to my chair.  Now she has elaborate perches and cat furniture all over this house. She is not limited as I let her go everywhere (except counters and tables but she never has anyway) and right now she is literally 1 foot from me on a shelf that I made into a window seat for her.  What is even more strange is tonigth when I got out of the shower she was right outside the door.   Now she is just fine.  She has 1/2 oz boiled chicken every night as she eats her dry food for her nutrients and is in perfect health.  When I feed her the chicken I make her do 10 laps around the inside of the house b/c I don't want her to become a fat, lazy house cat! I only tell you all of this because none of her eating habits etc.. have changed.  The only thing that is very different is she follows me everywhere.  It is freaking me out.  Of course, I am concerned that she might \"know\" my bc is back and I won't be finding out until after surgery.  Can anyone of you shed some light on any behavior your pets may have expressed while you went through this mess?  Oh, one more thing: she has taken to sleeping ON TOP OF ME! This is all really weird. She was ok during chemo but she was kind of close to me then.  All of my friends are saying \"oh, they know when you are sick!!!\"  They just have no clue what that means to someone in a cancer battle.  Please help, guys!  I didn't even want to tell you all what is going on with these masses and how much they, in combination with my cat, are renting a lot of space in my head.  Every day we are alive and not being scanned or having surgery is another day we get to forget that we have this disease.  It is nice to forget sometimes. Any and all feedback is appreciated!  Sorry to drag lumps into this thread but I am so tired of having masses all inside that left breast pocket after having cancer there.  It is scary. The whole thing is just nerve wracking and, yes, I am having surgery soon.  I just want these masses out of my chest.   Alas, after all that, here is a little pick-me-up! www.youtube.com/watch?v=zz4cxY...  Thanks, guys- ",

Awful. Very scary. What is even more disheartening is the fact that you will be getting a big bill. I would send whatever bill you get to Gov Christie and ask for some consideration. For the love of God, you don't have a money tree in your yard. It really bothers me that you stayed outside, in the parking lot, because of the doom of the impending bill. That sucks. My father was very smart and when I was body building, and getting into playing with amino acids, he reminded me that the body has it's own balance and it is delicate. He was cautioning me into putting too much of anything in it. His caution was helpful and the same goes for herbs, vitamins etc...  We can easily make a molotov cocktail out of ourselves!  I remember your collar bone lump...that was so scary also. The reason I am so bothered by these lumps, besides the fact that I am an unradiated (b/c of infection in left breast) Stage IIb, the fact that I get so much pain in that pocket and under my arm. Also, and away from those other rocks that are in there, I found a pretty good lump right where the cancer was before. I know on some level I am petrified about all of this and I am just trying to not flip between now and surgery. That is really cool about the bra you found!!!! I have never purchased clothes at Walmart/Kmart/Target (not b/c I am above it but rather I can't get comfortable shopping on the midway, across from the automotive dept and adjacent to electronics!) but b/c of this surgery I needed a cheap pair of like cargo shorts to accommodate drains etc... Sure enough I found a pair at Walmart for $11!!!!!!! I could not believe that I actually found clothing that cost only $11!!! It was such a great feeling! I am about as happy w/my shorts are you are with that genie bra! Timothea: I am so disgusted with my inability to complete week 2 successfully. It is challenging. If you read the site, it tells you to stretch it out meaning repeat the weeks as many times as necessary. Honestly, though, Timothea-I would seriously take it easy if I were you as you are on chemo and it must be, at least on some lever, be affecting your breathing. Pick it up again when you are done with chemo. You know, yesterday I met one of my surgeons for the first time. He will be in one on the team for my upcoming surgery. He is younger than me, handsome and is very, very likeable character! I can't explain it but he has a very, very nice way about him. In any case, and in speaking to your point about being young and wanting to dress that way, I was talking with him about my age and this weird place I find myself. He said whatever it takes to make you feel whole again is exactly what needs to happen. How emotionally intuitive is that? I just thought he said that very well. Timothea, it is hard to be w/out boobs at such a young age and I don't blame you for wanting to dress and look your age. Go get a genie bra!!! That boob job issue is very funny!!! My bf who I have known for 24 years, went to college together. Her boobs were NO WHERE NEAR the size they are now and I keep telling her that I know she got a job done and she insists it was from breastfeeding! Well, I confronted her with some of our old college photos over a few bottles of wine one night!!!! She still claims feeding her boys did it! Her breast s are like 4xs larger than they were in college! Sptmm: that is so funny about the lopsidedness!!!! I, too, am pretty flat and the left has rocks in it so it is bigger. One of the masses is pretty substantial. In any case, and I am sure you would expect this from me, but some guy (he was a little old so I was nice to him!) was looking at me in line at JC Penney. I said \"sir, if you must know, I donated them to breast cancer!\" He said he was just trying to figure out what was going on!! I have a man journal with over 300 first dates (anecdotes...nothing graphic!) and I had all my fun at the man farm so I have no compunction about telling it just like it is!  You know, I guess all my playing paid off b/c I feel like I missed nothing and am not so uncomfortable in my current situation!  After all, I am not out looking to meet anyone with ½ my equipment gone anyway!  For the record, however, I want *something* back where they were!  BTW, woman, if I make it through this surgery, and even if there is recurrence and I have to have some radiation, I promise you, if I am back in the swing of things by November-ish, I will be running the Revlon with you next year!!!!! MARK MY WORDS, SISTER!!! We are there!!!!!! I think I will fly Timothea up to pass us water from the sidelines (like it is the NYC marathon!!!!!) She can provide dramatic services on our massive 5k!!!!! All this talk of running makes me think of Wherria. I wonder we our good old friend Whitney has gone? Calamtykel: sorry to talk about running so much...I feel bad that you can't do as much as you would like right now. Well, it looks like I am getting out of the hospital on the day of my very good friend's 40th birthday party! I don't know what I will do with my drains and pain killers!!! I really don't think I will be going after all! I can't take any chances, god knows I can't take any chances. She understands but is kind of sad about it...as am I. Timothea: that pic of the duck holding the beer made me think of some of those t-shirts at Walmart! As I walked around there, I mean some of those prints and patterns are just atrocious and I realized they do with clothing what restaurants do with food: try to serve us the cheapest cut of meat possible dressed in some tasty sauce!! At Walmart the tasty sauce is the price but they are buying the grossest, cheapest materials/prints/patterns, sewing them together and cramming them down the throat of America! I mean who wears this shit??!!! Even an old lady nearby was complaining to her daughter!  Constant fashion victims! I hope you all are doing well and having some fun for yourselves. I overdid it with the sun exposure and my shoulder and part of where my left boob used to be is burned....oh well!!!!!! I just don't care!!!! I am tired of shadowboxing, trying not to wake up my cancer!!! If I die tan and drunk on Bud Light Limes, it is all good!!! Speaking of sun, drinking and summer, what about those Yankees?!?!?! #goodtimes I hope you all have sweet and wicked dreams!!!!!!",

Rachel: I must tell you, I have nothing but pain under that arm. I get short, stabbing pains that start about 2\" below the armpit and move in the direction of my armpit. My breast is itchy all over and I also get pains right about where the cancer was originally. I am going to the onc next week and have surgery scheduled for July. I won't know until the masses that are in that pocket are removed and sent to pathology if I am dealing with recurrence or not. If mine is recurrence, it is at the chest wall but I am nervous b/c of the pains under my arm. As you all know, the lymph nodes are gone...what is that pain about? If it was either itching OR shooting pains, I would be ok but b/c it is both, I am more than a little concerned. I also lose feeling in my left arm and have broken 2 phones now. In long, yes, I am with you. If I never had bc, surely I would ignore all of this!!!! I wish I could go back to \"ignorance is bliss!\" Those were the days. As for the 5 year rule, I think I will \"mentally\" feel better at the 5 year mark. Plus, as I have said before, we are living in auspicious times and if this junk comes back after the 5 year mark who knows what we will have then? It could even be cured by then!!!! Someone among us is very shy and will not come forth regarding her recent athletic accomplishments! I am going to OUT her now!!!! Our very own Adey is over ½ way finished with the \"Couch to 5K\" and is going out to run 2 miles tomorrow!!!!!! She literally went from the couch to 2 miles in 3 weeks!!!!! She also biked about 40 miles over the weekend! Yes, one of our own has clearly joined the \"LIVESTRONG\" movement!!!!! Let's wish her well on her 2 mile run tomorrow!!!! Go get em'! Adriene, I am so happy for you and proud!!! It is such a huge accomplishment. Good for you ;) One more thing:  There I was, having made friends with some luscious cabernet sauvignon (he he he!), at a bonfire this past weekend and was whining about my hair!!!  The longest parts are down to my shoulders but still, I want my long hair back before, God forbid, this crap comes back and I lose it all again!!  2 or 3 of the women there were like \"use Mane and Tail\" shampoo!!  I was stunned...I had never heard of this!  They insist my hair will grow crazy after using this.  Sure enough, flew down to CVS and grabbed 2 bottles (as I knew I would be making this announcement on this thread---like this is WSJ.com or something!) and am off to the shower to let it rip!  Will let you all know how it goes and in the interim, don't wait for me, place your own $10 bet on this one!!!  Have a lovely evening! I am watching \"America's Got Talent\" which is what I watch when the Yankees are not on! My Yankees are doing very, very well! Night all-",

      "Content": "Jul 15, 2012 06:33PM - edited Jul 15, 2012 06:34PM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors! I hope everyone is doing well. Sptmm: Timothea does raise a good point about wanting to achieve peace of mind through your next surgery. That is the biggest benefit to bmx. As for my upcoming surgery, I am way more concerned, and will be sick waiting, for the pathology on the 3+ masses that are in that breast pocket. That is totally what I am concerned about. I also just got to the point where I could put my hair back (Robert Palmer video style!) and all I can think is if I have to have chemo again, there goes almost 1 ½ years of regrowth. Hopefully they will try radiation first. Deb, something else, I am going to go into the PET scan issue in this post. If you continue to have questionable results from tests etc.., request a PET scan. It is the only scan that will give you peace of mind. Timothea: is sand art where they use food coloring and then layer it in like a bottle, for instance? I remember my older brothers and sister doing art w/rice by coloring it and then gluing it on plywood and I do remember them doing that sand art as well. As for the mx clothes, I got hooked up with some place in FL and they got me a bunch of camisoles with the drain holders inside. I have used the ace bandages especially in the shower. All I can say is us bc girls go through a lot and not the least of which is these surgeries and the drains etc.. Speaking of what we go through, I feel it necessary to list here on our thread what \"PET Scan\" results mean, when they are considered normal, when they are considered negative and when you might have a recurrence, as follows: ************************************************************* \u2022 Use the Standardized Uptake Values (SUVs) scale to measure the brightness of a hot spot on a PET scan. The scale range is zero to 15. Zero indicates no uptake, and 15 is maximal uptake. Most cancers are above 2 or 3 on this scale. \u2022 4 Decide if the SUVs are in the 2 to 3 SUVs range. If they are, discern whether the patient may have cancer or the hotspots may be a sign of highly metabolic normal tissues. Highly metabolic normal tissues can register in the 2 to 3 SUVs range also, but it would abnormal for this tissue to be closer to 15. A \"zero\" is a negative PET result and that is \"THE\" only negative pet result. Twos (2s) and threes (3s), if not in the brain, heart, lung area are indicative of an inordinate amount of metabolic activity. For anyone with a history of cancer, anything above a 3, is more than likely indicative of a malignant event. Don't let doctors and all their words and nonsense try to mislead you. If any of them had xray eyes, we would not need PET scans. It is imperative you be your own advocate and I felt compelled to list this now as I have a friend who had bc, had uptake on a PET and all the docs kept telling her she was fine and it was b/c of blah blah blah. Well, as I type, she is at MSK in a very bad way, like last rights \"bad way.\" This happened to her b/c everyone was philosophizing about her results. If you are not getting the answers you need or feel that you are not being heard, move the \"EFF\" on and find a medical professional that is going to listen to you. An ex boyfriend of mine, when we first discussed I had bc, told me the most important thing he learned through a healthcare challenge was you must be your own advocate. It took me until now to fully realize what he meant. I also know that I have mentioned what I now consider to be his \"sage\" advice before on this thread but it bears repeating. Be careful and get the attention you need because as cancer patients, it is unequivocally a matter of life and death and you know what? Your life does not matter to anyone as much as it matters to you. I also put the SUV range on this thread for our \"watchers\" and \"read-only\" cyber friends! Seriously we all need to be clear on this stuff. Tex: that is another good point about people overdoing it. Deb, she is absolutely correct. You really have to pace yourself and listen to what your surgeon tells you relative to pacing yourself through recovery and back to activity. It is really, really easy to fall into a false sense of security when it comes to feeling a little better after surgery and then subsequently pushing it. BTW, Timothea, you might be 15 to 20 years younger than Deb and I but after we put our dentures in, stretch out our hip flexors and take our arthritis meds, watch out YOUNG BUCK!!!! We are comin' for ya! Finger-wagging and all! Bosu ball: Finally, a doctor I met at a gym who was struggling to keep himself up on the bosu ball was telling me that a very large percentage of accidents in the elderly population is due to balance issues. I did not know that but it makes sense. I figure if we start now, and Obamacare and cancer don't kill us (!!!), perhaps we should work on our balance! A challenging thing to do: try to balance yourself, on the small of your back, on top of the bosu ball and do crunches! No, it is not impossible! On the contrary, it is quite possible and a good core workout at that! Happy trails, girls!",

Sweeney: yes, I do believe we are honorary canucks!   As for your friend w/the 2cm and no node involvement, usually if there is no node involvement then they don't radiate or do chemo. The nodes are what largely dictate further treatment.  Of course, if that were me, I would most like clamor after some chemo or radiation!  Once you know you have cancer, you want all the txs or you somehow feel exposed, naked, shorted of the full experience! Seriously, though, I am really happy for her.  That is great news. I did not want to mention the mall story here until I heard from you.  I know it sounds silly but one never knows.  I do feel for those people.  Of all the things we take for granted, the least of which is not our venerated malls shining on forever as the beacon of capitalistic structures they are.   I still can't believe that happened. Well, cancer patients can't be TOTALLY kicked around anymore!!!!  We have Obamacare so people like me who despise sucking the corporate umbilical cord for benefits will now be able to buy \"some\" insurance in the open market and I cannot be price gauged either!!! he he he!!!!  Preliminarily this looks good for people like us with catastrophic health event but, on balance, I do believe both good and bad will come of it.  Before anyone gets nervous that if they don't have insurance they are going to be attacked by the IRS, the fine is $95 approximately, per year, if you don't carry! Seriously, some in Washington were going bananas talking about how the fed is going to take everyone's returns. First off, I have not gotten a \"return\" in 16 years and furthermore, those that are uninsured and are now in the poor house over healthcare costs really are not going to be very affected by such measures!  It reminds me of the \"forever\" stamp=smoke in mirrors!  How long do any of us actually \"keep\" a book of stamps?!?!?  That was a big, marketing ruse! I think, at least, on some level, cancer patients scored today and this makes me happy.  Of course the Dow was tanking right after the announcement as all the HMOs and PPOs and __O's and pharmas will not be able to make as much money on their guaranteed cash cow aka sick Americans! Why our govt let them get as far as they have is beyond me.  The other night I was talking with a (staunchly Republican) friend who was predicting that all the doctors are going to leave this country if Obamacare got approved.  When I asked him where they were going and that where on this earth are they making the kind of profits off of the sick as they are (were) here right in the US = no answer!  THat is what I thought!! Rachel and Sweeney: btw, the Hawkish lunatics in Washington were predicting \"armageddon-like\" lines for getting medical care (like in Canada) now that we are on the precipice of having a quasi-socialized medicine system!  Yes, I don't think Washington yet knows about google!!!!!!!

BTW, for all the travelers out there, I gave up on luggage, packing and airlines long ago and now I just FedEx whatever I need to where I am going and it goes home the same way. It works out great. I never go to the airport with anything more than cell phone, gum, a few credit cards and clothes on my back! I cannot stand, for 2 seconds, having all my stuff rifled through. I am cautiously optimistic that eventually airlines will run separate \"luggage flights\" to A) get the luggage out of the belly of the plan and B) avoid the lines, frisking etc... It is also far, far safer to send luggage ahead of the flight. Of course, perhaps we would be required to drop our luggage at a \"drop station\" the day before we fly but I just think it is healthier way, esp post 9-11. That is all, that is all! I hope you all greatly enjoy yourselves, are having good times and are having as little drama and stress as possible! Night, all-",

Very well put! I just am brought right back to the dx when I have a string of related dr appts in a short period. Guess I should be more grateful, however! Deb, that sucker-punching is the worst. Of course, the first dx was a huge sucker-punch. I think this is why cancer is called the \"silent killer.\" A guy from old job was at my house speculating that a woman at work who said she had cancer probably didn't because she is a liar and/or looking for attention. He remarked that she did not \"look\" sick. I explained that I don't often look sick either and I resent the implication.  Cancer does not make any of us \"look\" sick until the final few months and during chemo.  Of course, he quickly exonerated me of being in this dubious category because mine had been \"verified?\" WTH?! I was pretty pissed. Bottom line is who lies about having cancer? The other thing is cancer does not have outward signs. For these reasons, we will most likely become more and more anesthetized to the potential for sucker punches yet to come! You know they are coming so we just hold on tight, go for the ride and, as you said, hoping if something is happening, it is caught early. I still maintain we are living in auspicious times! That is great that your dad will have a cooler of water!! What a nice guy. Reminds me of the last time I was engaged, to a guy I would posthumously find out my father hated, and I had the flu. My father brought me over water and Gatorade and some other get-better stuff! I loved my dad so much! He was the best. My fiancé was very caring also but my dad had high expectations relative to who I should be settling down with in such a serious manner and that guy did not fit the bill! I would eventually end it myself, leaving my father and mother secretly enthralled! In any case, very glad your dad is there for you and with a cooler of water no less! #goodtimes I have been meaning to tell you all for days one night last week I woke up around 3 and HSN was on! Don't know how that happened but I am in one of those in the 65% of Americans who fall asleep with the TV on! In any case, they were going over these \"Rhonda Shear\" Ahh bras. They were selling a 3 pack that came with the removable pads. I am here to tell you all if you can find bras with removable pads, you can easily expand those pads to make them whatever size you need with just a sewing machine. Also, the fill in my post bmx camisoles is all just run-of-the-mill cotton ball style stuffing one might buy at a fabric store to make a pillow. I just thought it was another option for any of you who had lumpectomies and are dealing with imbalance or for those w/mx or bmx and have not yet, or will not ever, do recon. If my sleepiness did not interfere, I do believe the pockets were big enough to put in a more substantial pad. 49.99 for 3 and they look wicked comfortable. All things to consider. Also, they are always advertising some \"flex pay\" on HSN. That means you can pay in installments so for anyone wanting to \"try them before they buy them,\" I would use the flex pay if possible and then return them if you are unhappy. IN this way you are only waiting for a credit of $15 or so as opposed to a $50 credit to your card. I have volunteered with the elderly for years and if anyone knows all the HSN/QVC tricks, it is elderly women!!!! That is where one explained to me how to use the flex pay to your advantage when you are just not completely convinced you are going to love the product. Smart! I hope you all are enjoying yourselves! Me, Sptmm, Ckptry and Calamtykel are getting a hefty dose of Fall weather in July today! We have all dropped 30 degrees and right now it is cool, rainy and 70 degrees! They say in CT if you don't like the weather, wait a minute! Good day!",

      "Content": "Jul 29, 2012 05:37AM - edited Jul 29, 2012 05:40AM by 1WonderWoman We are having the strangest storms ever and all of the sudden the sky turns dark gray, my phone starts buzzing and I know we are in for another whopper of a thunderstorm which nowadays includes tornado and flash flood warnings. This is indeed very weird for this part of the country. Rachel: wow, I was at my sister's last night and we watched the opening ceremonies for the Olympics (or most of it!) and the delegation from Canada was 277 athletes strong! Quite a group! I love the Olympics and will be watching it in its entirety. It is such an awesome display of athleticism on the parts of the planets very best. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!! I hope you have a lovely day with your family. Birthdays sure me more to us all now! Rachel, that is a good point about the death of estrogen being tantamount to bone pains b/c ain't that the truth! Some days I am so ached out. Sptmm: I hope these storms don't knock out our Olympic viewing abilities!!!! I like handball, volleyball, relay swimming, and gymnastics. Those are my favs but I will watch it all. I just think it is very exciting! I hope that soup comes out good. Let me know. To be honest, on all the aches and pains, I don't even talk to them about it. I just live with it. They will test the ___ out of us and never really come up with a definitive answer. I figure if it gets really bad, my body is def trying to tell me something and I will go subject myself to mo scans! I am just at the point now where I am in the final stretch and I really just want to put this mess behind me for a while. Deb, what a shame you had your big family reunion today!!!!! You poor thing! Geesh, feel so bad for you. I think LI just got some crazy storms as CT is getting right now. Perhaps there is an indoor facility/some cover where you are. I hope it is fun just the same! Tex: that stinks that you had to cut your trip short. The weather is berserk this summer, however. I know even here 90s and constantly very humid is pretty odd. The whole summer has been weird and filled with life-threatening storms...like twice a week now! I know what is up with the dizzy spells. This morning I got up fast and it happened again. Who knows? I am not going crazy about it. On Ming Tsai, first time I ever saw him was on Oz. Ok, now I understand he was a big shot before he deigned to make an appearance on Arthur! Timothea, thank you so much for being the only one here to own up to your secret desires for Kim Jong Un! I was trying to be a catalyst to help all the ladies here to let go lusting after that hot man! I know, it is all so much to deal with! Speaking of hot men, TX better fatten that luscious Matthew McConaughey back up when he is through doing the movie about the Dallas guy who had aids, left the country, smuggled in holistic meds and subsequently sold them to largely homosexual men afflicted with aids in the Dallas area circa late 80s. He got so skinny to play that role, he looks gross! He needs 30 lbs at least! I mean, he is no Kim Jong Un but hot nonetheless! Thank you so much for the hamster wheel analogy b/c, yes, we all are running on that b....!!! Sweeney: May there be no bear attacks! Some idiot in CT took his dog on some remote walking path along a reservoir in W Hartford. If you live in W Hartford, you know full well there are bears off the beaten track around the reservoir. Of course, he most likely took the path so he did not have to leash his dog. Sure enough a bear came out and tried to eat his dog and was stopped by this guy pulling a gun and shooting the bear. His dog later died at the vet and for a few days the state was considering charging him for the shooting etc... What are you doing carrying a gun at the peaceable reservoir? Jerks. I think it is time to arm the bears! Ginger: you are a permanent and special part of our group and come and go as you very well please ;) You are always in my thoughts and I look forward to periodic updates and, of course, should you get scared about this crappy disease and all its spookiness, come on back! We are here! Now back to the Olympic-watching for me! Good day girls!",

      "Content": "Aug 13, 2012 03:17AM - edited Aug 13, 2012 01:30PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! I hope everyone is well. Sorry I have not been around but this surgery knocked me out. This was long and I am tired. I take so many naps...it was a lot. I have not been on this computer or on the net from my phone in days. Just tired and trying to muddle through. Unbelievable how much this surgery took out of me. As for the results, I cannot believe these surgeons can take such unruly fat and form it into fabulously symmetrical breasts! After all I had been through, I just was not sure what to expect with flaps. I can't believe these 2 match and they are just my own body fat! It is amazing what these surgeons can do. I remain in awe of these results. Just amazing.    Calamtykel: I can't believe you are in the waiting room again. I hope you get some good news very soon. When you write you are in until Friday, Monday or beyond, it is just awful to wait somewhat indefinitely. Then going to the amusement park, trying to enjoy yourself by having an ice cream cone, driving home sick (b/c of course you had to pay for having consumed ice cream!), getting your period and then trying to take something to feel better which made your stomach worse is all just too much to deal with. I feel for you. Good luck on your sales and getting the homeschool items you need.  A friend homeschooled her kids and said the stuff was a bit pricey.  Meant to tell you- was watching the Travel Channel (best water parks show!) and there is a new show starting completely about a vintage toy trader.  All he does is buy and sell vintage toys.  I thought you might find it interesting but I failed to jot down the name of the show!  Easy enough to find!  My friend has a farm and she raises animals for food. It is so ambitious. Best of luck with that. Texas: where are you? I hope you are doing well! When is your next chemo? Rachel: how is scanville going and your check-ups? Thinking of you. I get pathology results this week. Cautiously optimistic.  You know, it is at a time like this that I am not too concerned about getting the path quickly.   I am a little afraid this time.  Well, I feel it is nap time once again! Good day, girls-",

I hope you all are well and missed you while I was gone b/c, in fact, I was gone! Sptmm: Deb, I love the avatar! What a great pic of you and the kids!!!!!! You all look summerfied and wonderful! Rachel, Sweeney, Kel and Lady: best of luck in scanville! Sweeney: hope you are enjoying the cottage!  CT weather is grossly equatorial and nearly every day we have crazy thunderstorms...just like FL these days!  I am sure your cottage up in cooler Canada enjoys much nicer weather than this!   Texas: what an adorable avatar!!!! You all have made some nice updates while I was gone! I am so glad your scans are showing nothing new!!!!! That is great news! Ginger: was not on vaca! I go on vaca but I never post it here. I guess the ubiquitous nature of the www leads me to not have to b/c my phone and pad work everywhere I go so there is never any down time from posting except for when.... I HAVE MASSIVE SURGERY! I had humongous surgery on Tuesday and am awaiting final pathology. I will slowly tell you all more and connect through PMs as well (as I kept some of you informed pre-surgery). Slowly but surely I will give up all the details! For now all masses were removed, recon done and am awaiting final pathology! It was a very, very long surgery and I awoke to my neighbor from childhood holding my hand, petting my forehead telling me all was going to be ok! She is respiratory therapist at Yale and because they had no room on SICU, I was put elsewhere and she happened to be working on the \"elsewhere\" unit! She had no clue what had happened to me to cause me to be on her unit and almost passed out when she saw me. It was so nice to wake up to her as family and friends had been there since 6AM, once they knew I had finally gotten out and once they knew I was ok and out of the woods, they left! I am happy to be done and over with it all. Am so tired but so grateful the Olympics has been on! It was so nice to have the Olympics to watch while going through this mess! Have you all been enjoying the Olympics? Hope so! It is the best competing against the best...what could be wrong about that? Finally I have to tell you all I had such an overdose of those lying polticians and their stupid ads while I laid in that bed, I very well might not  watch network television again until December! ",

      "Content": "Aug 8, 2012 11:59AM - edited Aug 8, 2012 12:01PM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors!  A few things I noticed when talking to in/around the hospital these past number of weeks.  It seems a lot of the stories of \"my _____ had bc, was fine for years and then 10 years later, mets occurred and they are now gone.\"  It seems the 10 year mark is a resounding theme with those who have lost the women in their lives to bc.  I was thinking about this today and although mine is simply armchair analysis, perhaps we should think about getting pet scans around year 8 or starting to clamor around that time?  Might be worth our while because if we all make it to that point, a little extra looking around that 10 year mark might make all the difference. Has anyone else noticed that 10 year mark business? I continue to take \"look alike\" liberty with our dreadfully minute avatars and now I think Calamtykel resembles Kerry Walsh from the USA Volleyball super team!!!  I made that little connection tonight! As for our group chat, I am working on a date and was also thinking as a way to commemorate our years together, maybe putting together a brief timeline and highlighting key events to be posted by each of us, all on one day, might be enjoyed and also help future readers know what the 2 to 2.5 year timeframe looks like.  Let me know your thoughts. Party on warriors!  ",

I went to the follow up with my surgeon today and aside from the fact the 2 belly drains were putting out over 175ccs and both drains fell out prematurely leaving me open to develop a seroma, all seems to be going well. I asked about final pathology and he said he could could look it up but then we got sidetracked and I walked about without finding out. My ride was waiting also and I just don't think I wanted to hear the news just then. The bottom line is I am petrified this time. Absolutely petrified. I hate this disease and I had so many saline flushes in the 5 days I was hospitalized after surgery, each time I wanted to vomit. That damn saline flush is such a reminder of chemo, it sickens me. I have another visit with the surgeon next week so they can monitor for seromas and I will ask at that time. If all is clear, it does not matter if I wait 1 more week and if it is not, it still does not matter because I am in no rush whatsoever to get back to chemo. For the first time in a long, long time I sat here crying because I realized how petrified I am to get those damn results-I just hate it. Calamtykel: I agree with Ginger in that you need to call and get their attention. Honestly, though, I could do the same thing but I really don't want to know. For me not calling and whining and just waiting until next week is a master avoidance technique. If I were you, I would start at 9AM and just keep calling every hour until you get an answer. That should do the trick! My post-surgery appetite is awful.  Everything tastes wicked salty.  I just broiled some salmon.  Going to try to eat that and go back to bed.  I am so tired from this surgery, it is going to be a while before I recover. Good times!  ",

The uniform thing is somewhat fragmented in public schools in CT and the other day I saw one of the high schools emptying out...oh boy! I do believe uniforms are in order! Get a nap on Tuesday! Nap it up! BTW, those kids all look pretty happy to be heading off to school! As for the yucky drains, this one is in my stomach and is a \"pigtail catheter?\" Whatever, all I know is then there is this long tube leading to a bag that I have strapped to my leg. Those clots find their way, in an incredibly lethargic manner, down the tube to the bag and then I empty it. The blue tip that I unscrew at the bottom of the bag at emptying time gets clots caught in it....uber gross! I gag, it is so gross.  Oft times I let the nurses empty and clean it!  Ladyinbama: Woot, woot indeed on the start of football! I am really not a fan, however! It is all the tackling and violence! I like baseball, as you know! My brothers both played football and although I know about all those pads and how they are all protected, those \"pile ons\" when one guy is at the bottom of the heap scare me also! In any case, I am very happy your football season has begun! Yeah, I am trying to take care of myself but had a nightmare last night that the drain fell out! I woke up almost crying! So sad. I hope you have a blast \"turning the Capitol teal\" on Tuesday!!!!!!! Good for you. Ginger: sorry to hear about the small doggie leg issue. It is so sad. I hope he is ok. On a related \"small dog\" note, my mother had a Chihuahua and the funniest thing ever was putting on \"boots\" she had purchased for him. I never saw a dog walk on 2 legs!!! He also had a kangaroo fur coat but alas I digress! If you want a little chuckle when you get home from the vet, go to YouTube and search \"dogs in boots\" or something to that effect and you will have one heck of a good time for yourself watching those videos! They are all small dogs and it is hysterical! Not for nothing, on the early morning call, 8:30 is wicked early for the east coast on a Sunday! Your friend clearly had something on her mind! Rachel: best of luck with your results on Thursday. Let us know how it goes. Don't forget, on yoga, Living Arts makes an AM/PM series that are only 20 minutes. They are for beginners and you can order it right at Amazon and do it in the comfort of your home. Patricia Walden and Rodney Yee are wonderful and I have been doing those workouts on and off for years. Also most cable systems have free yoga on the video store channel. Sweeney: any results on bone scan? You are most likely terrorizing the bears up at your cabin in the woods this weekend! Well, \"Woodswoman,\" when you reemerge let us know the results of your bone scan! Hope you are having a good weekend- Well, off to broil salmon! As I type I just know I am overcooking my brown rice! I ran out of Nishiki which I totally prefer but I am just too lazy to go out to the store! Happy Labor Day USA girls!",

Rachel-SO, SO, SO VERY HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!! I am so glad those scans were clean. I know what you mean about constantly feeling like you have to look over your shoulder with cancer. When we were young, there was a generic cartoon and they had the \"mother-in-law\" car! It was funny and it was like an extension off the back of the car that was the length of the vehicle itself and then there was an egg type of container there. That is where the mother-in-law sat!! More to this point, since bc, I feel like my life is that car and in the egg is the shadow of cancer, always one car's length behind me. I do, however, seek solace in knowing that I will stay ahead of it!!!!! IN long, we all feel the same way and the busier we keep ourselves, the more we can hopefully keep it far away. I hope you have a great weekend and if I were you, I would treat myself to a massage!!!!! Tex: my hero!!!!! Geez, girl, I just don't know what to say! I think so much of you! I cannot believe what you have undertaken, with a smile on your face, being positive and very spirited right through. I just love ya! I hope next week you schedule some afternoon naps and perhaps a bath or 2!!! Maybe your niece can help you out a bit. I totally am against kids becoming family servants but b/c of the amount of people in your household now, and the chemo, perhaps she can chip in a bit. I am just so glad they are back together and with you. I can safely say I think you are one of the greatest people I have ever come to know and I am glad I have made your acquaintance on that note! You give me hope for all the dastardly others in this world!!! Sweeney: I think the bears won!!!!! I am wondering where you are!! This thread is about support, through good and bad, so if, forbid, anything came up on that bone scan, come back and talk about it. Let us know what is going on. To be honest, we are all at the 2 year mark so, and most unfortunately, all of our news may not be good going forward. We might have questionable scans and we need to talk to each other about this stuff. Only we collectively know the true nature of this battle. I am really typing this message to everybody. I want us all to get so busy we are not around here so much and that we all revisit and healthy, non-cancer existence but at the same time this thread was always about support and we are all here for you and each and every one of us, through good and bad. Now, having said that, I just hope you are wicked busy and forgot about us!!!!!! Please do come back when you have a chance and let us know how you are. Miss you- Sptmm: I can only imagine you are running a 20K as I type (!!!!) and hope you have a nice weekend, woman!  Someone else who I have met in this cyber-capacity who is completely remarkable and fills me with hope for more athletic days again!!!!  Ok, I have to go shower as the nurses are coming to check my \"hissances?\" whatever those are and I am not even going to trouble you all with too many details about my \"seroma\" NOT CLOSING. I am, however, going to share with you all the latest technique they are going to try to use to close it and, of course, if this fails back to surgery I go. In another post this weekend I will share the details so you all will know about this should you ever need it going forward. Good day girls and wonderful weekend to all-",

      "Content": "Sep 20, 2012 04:10AM - edited Sep 20, 2012 04:12AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! I remain, with my lovely drain bag hanging from my stomach, fiercely entertained by \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia!!!\" Sweeney: I am so sorry to hear about your hot spot however I have an inspirational story for you to hopefully help you keep it in perspective!  I think I may have mentioned I was a tom boy!  I wanted a YZ so I could go to the canyons with the boys and my other tom boy gal pal!  After I cracked my head open trying to do \"Evil Kinevil\" stunts with my bmx bike, I got a swift \"NO\" to the YZ request...haters!!!! IN any case, winter was upon us and I was all of 10 years old looking for my next sporting high and stomping around still furious about the nay on the YZ!! Friends and I decided to go sledding down this wicked vertical hill, on our red flyers with newly greased blades, and the hill was replete with these amazing plateaus and drop-offs so no wonder I hit the gray steel pole that blended nicely with the trees behind it, head first no less!  It is stuff like that which will cause hot spots on bone scans.   The trauma from that kind of hit can last years.  I, too, had a hot spot on my skull on a bone scan which they kind of figured was caused by that sledding accident.  They never really figured out what was going on, if anything and there is always so much in the \"on deck\" circle w/me, it just got shelfed.  Just remember an infection or years-old trauma to your head.  Also, these tests are not 100% anyway.   Just take it easy and go get a massage.  Do you all have \"Massage Envy\" in CA?  I would just get a massage and do some yoga.  Try to relax.  Also, Ecuador has some fantastic housing prices and a friend just bought a waterfront condo for $35K!  Not joking.  It is an up-and-comer. Look forward to your trip, woman, and just really try to keep this in perspective.  Also, something I read on the Merck site, normally there need be \"several\" hot spots to indicate mets to the bones.  I know this one large spot could be precipitous of smaller ones that could be found later etc... and collectively be considered mets but one big one, I would not be too worried.  Don't worry, be happy!   OMG..I re-read my post from last night I realize I don't give a back-story!  I mentioned my female PS b/c I told her numerous times, pre-flap, that I did not want large breasts! My suspicion is the day of the micro PS was doing the preponderance of the work, she was doing another surgery and later in the day, when she checked in with my sister, the \"damage\" (so to speak) had been done!  I think she was doing a little Monday morning QBing (that is a little football nomenclature for you, Ladyinbama!!\") and also trying to gather from my sis if I really did not want large breasts.  Alas, what is done is done and there is zero reason to talk about such ludicrous matters now!  I am alive and I have what appear to be breasts once again=it is all good!!! Time to go get some plum tomatoes!  I have developed quite an interest in cooking and tonight is bruschetta and lazy Greek chicken cutlets!  Good times, girls!  ",

A few days ago at the hospital I met a woman who was a Stage II also. She said everything \"they\" need to know shows up in bloodwork. She is getting treated at the same hospital I am and they don't use tumor markers. Does anyone understand that statement? What shows in bloodwork? I thought it was an odd thing to say but I did not explore that comment. I think us bc girls are going through too much without being questioned by other bc patients about their comments!!!! Rae786: welcome, our friendly ghost!!! Nice of you to hop on and post!!! Texasrose is doing fine although she now has 4 children she is caring for and we hear from her much less now. I am so glad to hear you are doing well! Good news. Omaz: how are you? How are you feeling these days? I hope all is well and your dd is enjoying having her license ;) Rachel: how was the border shopping? I remembered you can get pretty cheap booze!!! Yeah, that is where my head is at!! Sptmm: how are you, woman? The final countdown!!! Just a few weeks away! I hope everything is going well with you. I was thinking of you this afternoon and was reminded what a great choice it was to do that lengthy, and scary for just that reason, surgery. I promise you, the symmetry is all but perfect *and* I look just about as I did before bmx. I think you are going to be very happy with your choice. Sweeney: I did not lose my mind! I know you have the check-up in 2 mos but I just want you to talk about it. Perhaps you are in Ecuador! Oh, another story (very colorful) about Ecuador: a lady was a venture capitalist and had millions, if not billions. She had developed some properties on the \"Gold Coast\" in CT. In any case, she had a lot of work crews. She sent a crew, with some workers from Ecuador, to Ecuador to work on a development project there. One of the women on her crew was 54 with a pacemaker. She got hooked up with some 20 year old guy and MARRIED him when they got back to the states!!!! Not joking when I tell you I just saw her about a year ago and they are still married, 5 years and counting!!!!! On that note, I hope you are having a good time there!!! He he he!! Calamtykel: I stopped at my friend's \"farm\" a few days ago and she had some chicks and I thought of you immediately! They are so cute! She is trying to convince me, and herself, that she will one day use them for food....I doubt it! She is loving those little jokers! Hope you are well. Ckptry: I hope this school year is going better for you than the past few. Of course, as you are stronger and healthier this year, surely the drama has died down now that you would be better able to handle it! I hope you are doing well. Ladyinbama: I was, you guessed it (!!!), at the hospital today and there was a nurse that went to Auburn!! She and another patient were fervently discussing football season and I thought of you immediately! I would later tell her you were a huge fan as well! She gave me a myopic view into \"Auburn Mania\" and that certain \"corner\" that is decorated I think? I forget. Just wanted to let you know you were squarely on my mind today ;) Texas: miss you, girl! Hope you are doing well ;) Ginger: I am glad to hear your onc appt went well. It is such a great sign when we have to go less and less!!! Good times, woman! The mammo in Jan is a little scary but I am sure you will be fine. Best of luck with the new migraine med and your upcoming dexa scan. You must have been wicked relieved to be told brain mets would present differently. I would have been a wreck so, on that note, I am very happy you got that news. How long have you been on aromasin? Just wondering. It very well could be involved with your migraine. Don't forget, it takes us 3-6 months to come up on these meds. I would check back as to when you started it. I hope you had a good weekend, too. Mommichelle: so funny about your foobs as I also ended up with slightly larger! I think mine will still go down a bit but I am not complaining about that tummy tuck!!!! Not at all! I am so happy with the results, it is just amazing what they can do for us. Like I was telling Deb in a previous post, it is one of the best decisions I have made in a long time. So how are you doing? How are your follow-ups? Any scans? Just wondering what your annual stuff looks like. Felisa: I think it was serendipitous you came to our thread as you and I are starting to sound like we are writing the same story about our bc experience!!!!! You poor thing, I am sorry to hear you were hospitalized although what I am starting to appreciate is that someone was watching you close enough to catch it and get you in that hospital. What you should ask them for is Furosemide to help you move the fluid in your breast pocket. It is a water pill although I don't know if they will give it to you on chemo. Also the sports bra is for compression. Wear it as much as you can possibly tolerate because it may very well force that fluid out of your breast area and help your body to reabsorb that fluid. If I were you, and I could tolerate 2 sports bras, I would wear 2. That is really maximum compression. They have to be a decent quality. After 20 years in gyms, I can safely say Champion makes one of the best sports bras. My breasts were big before bc and a friend and I, when we would run, had to wear 2 sports bras so I know it can be uncomfortable but I am only pretty sure it will help you. Ok, well it is time for to give all my attn to \"The Voice!!!!\" I am addicted...or is it Adam...or is it Blake....oh, I just don't know!??!! Happy trails, all-",

I did not even have the heart (nor the interest) in telling them I am in a cancer battle as well.  At times like that I like to remember we were born with 2 ears and 1 mouth for a reason!  I don't know, this disease is just ubiquitous. More to this point, years ago I went to an astrology event in NYC with a friend who was really into it.  He felt the stars guided us and I should go along with him!  It was a Tuesday night so I gave in!!  I was fairly impressed with her and as a result I periodically read my monthly scope on her site.  Today when I went to her site I found a message about her beloved mother having passed on.  She had written such a beautiful tribute to her mother and one excerpt I wanted to share with you all: \"....don't you know you were hand picked by God to have this painful illness? What If I told you that your pain might take away someone else's pain in the world?\" I was so surprised at this new idea that she had just offered me - that my pain could actually be used for a good and noble purpose. It was so intriguing, that I was momentarily stunned....\" I really thought this was very poignant.  This was her mother, to her, when she was a 9 year old child, bed-ridden for the entire summer with a leg problem.  In any case, I often reflect on the very notion.  I just thought it was well-written and as we travel on down this road, perhaps this will offer some solace at some point.  Now for some entertainment!!!  A guy I have known for years and years who is a bit of a loser (I am being nice!) had the audacity to call me this weekend to find out if I was going to be eligible for the new \"medical marijuana\" program in Connecticut b/c of my cancer!!!!!  I have no interest in such a program, even on my death bed, and certainly find such questions appalling!  I hung up! People are just insane!  Although I do fully understand why it was made medically legal in CT and that some people really need it and find it comforting.  It certainly has its place for people who are suffering, in pain and now have that option.",

In any case, I wanted to pass along this link to a very promising development in bc research that I found in the NY Times today, as follows: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/health/study-finds-variations-of-breast-cancer.html?_r=0 Remember, right click and select \"open in new tab/window\" to get to the article.

I am getting so nervous as my hot flashes calmed down, did not go away but calmed, and now they are back and very bad.  I am also getting so much itching where the cancer was before.  Sometimes you just think you are going absolutely mad with this disease. Tex: you have no idea how it warms my heart that you were able to use  our thread to track down the beginning of your cough!  I know that might sound a bit odd but I really love the idea that we have created a timeline here that will tumble through history with us.  I think it is just great! I might have already mentioned this but I speaking of help w/gas & groceries etc\u2026  I saw an interview with Matt Damon (whose father had cancer) about a charity he is involved with in the Greater Boston Area called \u201cFamily Reach Foundation.\u201d  He and Ming Tsai teamed up for it.  At this point it helps families with funds for practical needs like food and gas who are fighting pediatric cancer.  I would love to see that grow and extend to all cancer patients.  The basic needs are evident. In any case, this is why I want to get to work on the Pink Brigade.  Unfortunately some interior design joker already took that domain so I am back to figuring out how I will proceed.  What I want to do is fundraise for people who need groceries, utilities, a ride to the hospital, money even for parking etc.. . and also have a \u201chuman\u201d network of real volunteers, on the local level, who can help without judgment.  In this roll  will have only people who have had cancer. When I went back and forth to NY and Philly, my out-of-pocket had to be several hundred dollars.  We need charities that give basic help but so many people lie just to get a few bucks\u2026not sure how I would police that yet\u2026.perhaps \u201cPink Brigade\u201d cards?  Something to consider. I know what you mean about the shirt and I would not wear it either but in a way it is kind of funny!  I will tell you one thing: that person DOES NOT and NOR DID THEY EVER have cancer.  What pisses me off is they are selling questionable t-shirts and making money off cancer.  I don\u2019t like that at all. I remind people all the time the \u201cBank of Karma\u201d is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and if your withdrawals exceed your deposits, watch out!!!!  Well, I hope everyone is having a lovely day!",

I have been wicked busy setting up a room where I had an art studio. I moved it and then decided to move it back...I am so fickle! No, I am no artist! My stuff is horrible! I just do it b/c it keeps me busy and it can be fun. Ladyinbama: I am glad you got caught up in projects! Good for you! Two things to note: I talked to Timothea (Tex) and she said she is in remission again and off chemo = YAHOOOOEEEE! I was so happy to find that out. Also they found a hot spot on a scan Sweeney had. She will let us know more as she finds out.  Finally Sptmm is getting her new diep flap boobs at the end of this month!  I am happy with mine, that is for sure! I hope all is well for you and you are having some good times for yourself! You really deserve it! Adey: I totally know where you are at and why you cried. I do it now as well but did not all through treatment. That ride on the motorcycle and going to the show was a reminder of the days when death and cancer were not even a thought. Even now as I plan to go to law school I can't help but think about the \"time\" I will be investing in that goal and I wonder if I am up for it and if I had to, for lack of better words, \"live like I were dying,\" what would I do differently? It is all so weird and I am so aware of time, like I feel I don't have much left. I totally know how you feel. Sometimes when I remember how full of life I was, partying my ass off in Manhattan, going from happy hour to Asia de Cuba to the village to some dance clubs or out to the Bronx to a Yankee game and how my life was so much different and I did not think about death. Then this weekend I caught a few minutes of \"Catch Me if You Can\" and Christopher Walken, who plays the father, dies running down stairs in Grand Central to catch a train and all I could think was I did that a thousand times and now, with my new reality, I would have to be worried about something like that. Listen, I hope we all live into our 80s and die in our sleep but the fact is this disease has left me scrambling to get stuff done before I have to leave. It is the strangest feeling ever. I know why you cried. Ginger: what a cute dog!!! He looks like a standard Poodle? Is he? Don't get upset with me if you already told us his breed!!! I forget a lot these days but then again, I don't have to tell you that! What pic is Adey talking about of your dgd near Fuzzies?! Are my eyes going now also?!?! Rachel: He is so handsome!!!!!!! He really looks like a hockey player! I don't know where I come up with that but I do! In fact, if I can find a pic of my brother when he was young I will post it as he reminds me a lot of my brother thus the \"hockey player\" comment! I hope your thyroid med is working. Congrats on the 10 lbs! I think in a week or 2 I can start working out again and I am looking very forward to this! Well, I actually jumped on the computer to make a note reminding myself to watch Kimmel tomorrow night for the \"burning of the capezios!\" Whomever gets kicked off DWTS goes on Kimmel and they burn their dance shoes! It is the only way I can keep up with DWTS b/c the Voice has got all my attention not to mention our Senatorial debates here in CT, the VP debate (wickedly entertaining!) and now the Presidential debate and MY YANKEES!!!! Tomorrow night is a tough one as I have the Voice, the Yankees and the Presidential debate! I just hope our President makes an appearance tomorrow night because that hologram they sent the last time really sucked! I think that hologram would have been better suited in Coachella!

What a cute pic!  Standard Poodles are great!  Smart and that prancing is very, very cute!  I know exactly what you are talking about. As for law school, I was supposed to go after undergrad but got into the Wall St game. Was the only girl in the old boys school, made a ton of money and burned out! Around 2005 I took a few years off, lived off of what I made, partying, going to the Yankee games, traveling etc.... Well, when you are single and take care of yourself, that dream comes to an end fast! I ended up working for a behemoth company in marketing, largely as a stop-gap measure, and I thank god I did b/c by the time I was under the bc bus, those benefits have sure come in handy. Over the years I have volunteered with the elderly. Around this great nation there is a huge problem with nursing home abuse. For this reason I would go into elder law as ultimately I want to see nanny cams installed in all rooms in nursing homes. My primary focus would be estates and trusts, however, which is very much in my wheelhouse after the decade in the markets. Just last night a CNA was arrested in CT for beating up a patient. Not only a few months ago some smart people put a camera in their mother's room, suspecting violence, and sure enough they got footage of some very large CNA basically throwing their mother around. As for knowing \"female\" lawyers, after all those years on Wall St, I don't even consider such things. Gender is a non-issue for me. About the amount of time in law school, I am just trying to figure out a 3 year commitment and the time I will be spending doing that vs being able to do some traveling etc... but I know I am going to go. It was a goal since I was in middle school and is probably a good place to be while I meander down this bc path. Thank you so much for your thoughtful post, I appreciate it ;)  There is a lot to consider.  I continue to reflect on all of this. Perhaps I have not said this yet but HAPPY BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH, girls!!!!!!! Some people are so gross degenerates, it will never cease to amaze me and more to this point: someone stole the pink ribbon magnetic thing off my car! Who steals that type of sacred item and if they only knew I am a bc patient, I am sure that would not have changed their wicked mind!

Also, and sadly, I went from a woman with perfect teeth and having been brought to the dentist often times 3xs per year by my father who was rather festidious about dental care, to a post-chemo mess! Tonight I was chomping on a Jolly Rancher \"cinnamon fire\" and I realized a little chip occurred on one of my back teeth.  BTW, if you ever liked fireballs, DON'T get those Jolly Ranchers!   Tex: that is a really good point you make about the fact we move and then get dxd so to what state do they attribute dx?  I wonder.   That is a very good point, though.  Especially in the transient states of CA and FL.  Very good point.  Now I think about how much those stats must have a pretty wide margin-of-error. It is my opinion that CA, WA and Alaska are high b/c the pac rim will dump crazy garbage in the ocean and, as we saw with the garbage from the tsunami that devastated Japan, eventually that crap makes its way to the CA, WA and Alaskan shores.   As you see, almost the entire Northeast has the highest rates in the nation but oddly NY is not in there.  I believe that is b/c of upstate NY and part of the state lying on the St Lawrence as opposed to the Hudson, Atlantic and LI sound.  In this part of the country, having been settled first, a lot of garbage is in the land, the infrastructure and the ocean has been so polluted for so many years, it is almost intrinsic.  Of course, we have awoken to our perilous ways and are doing much better about our waters but I belong to a group involved with \u201csaving\u201d LI Sound and what I learn at our meetings is we still have a long way to go.   If you notice, it is all the high-commerce, once high-industrial states where the bc is the highest in the Northeast.  How it is getting in our breasts is a whole other issue!  I do believe the catalysts here in this part of the country are in the water, the infrastructure and the land we walk on.  It was never a plan but a byproduct of a burgeoning society and us, as a country, having gone from broke to no joke in a matter of 25 years.  It is the byproduct of our evolution and being a hegemonic state for so long.  We are waning from hegemony but the damage has been done. Omaz: yes, this disease definitely sucks.  I am sorry to read your news.  I did not want to mention but 2 people I know were *both* diagnosed on Monday.  It is awful.  One is 38 and the other is 40 and they think it is inflammatory.  I am very concerned about how both are going to deal with this.  They all look at me like I am teflon and to be honest, I don\u2019t know where I got the strength to roll through this mess like I did but I also realize not everyone has that.  I know they are likely going to struggle and one is a single parent.  I really lament those with lesser abilities to deal with this train wreck having to go through it.  The hardest part is the \u201cscary\u201d part and for me, the fact that I feel like I am walking around on borrowed time is cumbersome.  It is all a bit much at times and add to that our friends falling victim to this makes it all way too much.  I am so sorry for your friend, Deb.  She has you, though, and that makes it all easier for her emotionally and mentally.  I am glad she has you and you know what?  At dark times like what she is about to go through, one person can make all the difference ;) Rachel: I know that you are interested in our political system.  Well, let me tell you, that debate, albeit rather entertaining, totally pales in comparison to the VP debates which should have been a pay-per-view event and held in a cage!!!!!  If you have time, YouTube that debate!  It was hysterical.  So, yes, every 4 years we get first row seats to these spectacles!  Good times indeed!  I live tweet it also and it is just one big fun fest!  Aside from the entertainment value, this election is very much divided down the middle, you are right.  It will be interesting to see what happens. I am glad your results are all clear and you get a good 3 to 4 months before going again.  Very happy for you. Felis: I hope you are feeling ok today and feel strong enough to go again on Friday.  I am thinking of you and hoping you are feeling better. Well, much to my chagrin they announced Iron Man 3 is not coming out until May!!!  7 months?!  I love the Iron Man movies! Tex: I know you and your dh enjoy the warm weather but if he wants a really super lucrative job, I googled an ex of mine from years ago today as I saw his sister (she did not see me!) today.  He is a municipal employee in NYC and is a conductor on Metro North.  When you are a municipal employee in NYC your income can, and most likely will, be published.  He made ***$126,000*** last year asking people for their ticket!!! Asking people for their ticket!! Only $22K was OT!  So, if you want to relocate, you can get by on that amount in NY!!  The job is awfully boring, political but the benefits are stellar, the union is rock solid and the pension is great.  One problem: when they retire, they have to go back for their \"dose\" of electricity from all those years riding the trains with electricity running through their bodies.  Trade-offs abound! Omg---left NBC on after the Voice and on this show called \"Parenthood\" a woman was dxd, had surgery and they told her she was Her2 *amplified.*  I wonder what that is? Never heard that.    Sweet dreams all- better times and higher love are coming :)",

Felis: yes, chemo can make your eyes water.  I, at one point, had both eyes going but there was a time where it was one or the other.  One ran like a faucet for quite a while.  I just think the body is very interested in getting chemo out in any way possible and as expeditiously as possible.  For this reason, I think the tears are just another way of the body to get some of it out.  There is also a more complicated (and medical!) about how chemo affects our membranes etc\u2026  With each tx, you are getting closer to being done, woman!  Hold onto that and the before you know it, this entire experience will be relegated to the dustbin of history and you will be getting stronger and healthier once again ;) Big day today!  I am going to introduce myself to the treadmill again!  These surgeries take an awful lot out of us poor folks!

I know you mentioned your brother had moved to your area so I am glad you had a nice lunch with him and are having a good weekend!  Good to hear! I did not remember you going to a dr during chemo for your watering eyes.  My eyes were watering like crazy but I think I had just been to enough doctors and did not want to go to another. Talk about sports and embarrassing, how did Robinson Cano go into the post-season a .600+ hitter and leave a .050 hitter?!   They Yankees collapsed in the post-season and it was embarrassing.  What\u2019s more is I have no clue how they completely dismantled in those final games?  I am sorry to say, a friend got tickets to post season play at Yankee Stadium and I could not go for a few reasons: 1-I am still not feeling so great from that stomach drain business, 2-I could not bear the thought of watching them TANK at home and 3-it was kind of cold for me!  Aside from my pathetic excuses, the fact is I really can\u2019t handle watching the post-season games live!   I am one of those with my hands over my eyes!  Yes, you indeed do learn to sweat the small stuff! I am just enthralled you are having such a good time for yourself and keeping busy & I could not be happier for you ;)   There is something called \u201ctoo much \u201c and you definitely went through it and now look at you?!  Partying it up, hopping around and having a good old time-just the way it should be.

Well, I am back to football and cooking!  What a great Sunday!!!  One thing missing: the \u201cThree Tenors\u201d in the kitchen!!!  BTW, if one has to walk the length of a football field to burn off the 4.5 calories in an M&M (assuming they are walking about .25 MPH!!!) I am going to have to go out and do about 10 laps for eating that snack size Reese\u2019s today!! Good day, girls-",

Years ago I lived in Stamford, CT and there was a pretty bad storm where we lost electricity for a few days.  In any case, a hair salon in nearby Norwalk had lost power during business hours, left and forgot to unplug the appliances.  Sure enough, when the power came back on, the curling iron that had fallen on a couch created a humongous fire that burned out a number of buildings.  Speaking of burning houses, my father had us petrified of fire growing up (don't know why!) so I definitely unplug all appliances in the event of an outage. Thanks for the tips, however.  All good stuff and most easily forgotten as, and thankfully, we dont' have to deal with emergency situations much in these modern times. Iowa: there is a complaint or \"service excellence\" dept at most hospitals. This tattooing took place at a hospital, correct?  If you are really upset see a lawyer.  I found out that when you sue a dr they are hardly affected at all b/c of the healthy insurance they must carry, it is a foregone conclusion they will be sued. For this reason it is pretty much a non-event for them and you usually get a few bucks!  Felis and Tex: hope you both are doing well today. Here I go, back to Walmart!  ",

Felis: it means a lot to me that you come here and talk with us about what you are going through.  Chemo is quite an ordeal and we can help you.  BTW, make absolutely sure you take the antibiotics as prescribed even if you have to write notes.  What I did was just took a notebook and jotted down whenever I took the antiobiotics.  I just put the pill bottle on top of the notebook.  I really think you are going to be fine.  Chemo is a dark time but it leads to such a greater existence and I am really happy my GP kept on me about getting a mammo and/or US because then it was caught and I am glad I got treated when I did.  Don't forget, we are the lucky ones who actually catch it \"relatively\" early.  Gone undetected, we all know what happens. It is an insidious disease but chemo is very much your friend and stay strong, woman!  Better times are coming ;)  Stay positive, stay strong and whenever you need to unload or talk about what you are going through, we are here and do not hesitate.  I am glad you are doing ok today also.  It was my experience with chemo days 3-8 were pretty rough but I was also on TAC which is like the AK 47 of chemo!!!   One other thing: make sure you are monitoring your temp b/c they kept me on antibiotics all the way through chemo b/c I was immediately infected right after bmx.  The PS released me to chemo and whether he knew I was still infected is inconsequential.  What he did know is if he did not release me to chemo, the affects could have been far more deliterious.  SO I was infected pretty much right through chemo but my body did stop responding to the antibiotics so keep on checking yourself for fever.  Also my temp was way higher in the ear on my infected side.  Check both ears. You are almost there and then can celebrate getting back to a normal life with a little radiation twist! Hope everyone is having a good day!  BTW, if any of you want to volunteer, you might want to check with the local ACS as a woman I met at the event I spoke at told me they are really looking for volunteers.  something to consider ;) Later, ladies! ",

What an absolute disaster for you, however.  I am just glad they were able to successfully get a sample.  It is entirely feasible you started coughing while they were trying to do the procedure.  Even though you are \"under,\" your body is still doing it's thing including breathing which for you these days seems to be coupled with a cough. They will get to the bottom of this and then at least you will know what is going on and start to look at options - you just never know.  One step at a time.  Let's hope for the best and prepare for other things ;) We are all here for you and will be every step of the way.  You are the best, Timothea, and your positive outlook is absolutely remarkable.  Laughter and positive attitude are the best defenses against everything this life can toss at us ;)  Keep all those silly comedies nearby: Dodge Ball, Office Space, Just Friends, Road Trip, the American Pie anthology etc....!  Just keep laughing!!!

Right after that surgery there would be no way I would want to go to a relatives house or travel anywhere so hopefully that won't be the case for you.  I had a generator when I was on the water.  I kind of wish I kept it!  Tex: btw, on the emotive \"eff\" bombs, that is my favorite!!!!  Like when they could not get a vein on me so I elected no anesthesia for the stomach drain procedure and as soon as the doc stabbed me with that first needle, I left out a nice \"eff!\"   As for those dr appts, between the amount of time you have to travel and copays, definitely call tomorrow and get it all done at the end of the week when they have the biopsy results.  You can see that drain hole, right?  It sounds like they put a tegaderm on it.  PM me your address and I will overnight you wound supplies...oh wait, hurricane!!! Seriously, though, if you need some wound supplies, I will gladly send them FedEx so you would most likely get them on Weds as I don't think I will be going anywhere tomorrow. Lady: they don't call for evacuation here but when I lived on Long Island Sound they did.  From 20 to 40 I spent almost 10 years living on the beach and I have had quite enough!! The storms and the hammering and the plywood blah blah blah!  The \"no pet\" policy drives me crazy at the shelters.  The few times I did evacuate I went to a friends house and pets were in tow!  In one community they had a rather antiquated, reverse 911, speaker system and they would talk to us, at all hours, about evacuating if need be.  The speakers were mounted on phone polls.  Reminded me of the systems in place under Mao!!  As for weight is an albatross from the depths of hell!!!!  If it served you well during surgery well then hallelujah, sister!!!  At least it is good for something! Good for you on the 2 mile walk!  It makes you feel good, that is for sure.  Just got my car insurance bill and my rates are wicked low but I also have a (lawyer sponsored!!) clean driving record for nearly 20 years.  In any case, I pay in-full each 6 month period but they sent me an option to take the payment plan this time.  Mind you, I don't know why I am getting anything as my policy does not renew until 12/12! In any case, they charge $5 per month if you want to pay over the course of 4 months!!!!!  $5 is highway robbery!!!  I am getting old and cheap--very, very cheap!  ",

I remain in awe of this storm.  What is more surprising is Bloomberg announced the subways will reopen on Thursday.  I cannot even imagine how they are pulling that rabbit out of a hat.  I am nervous just thinking about riding a subway filled with electricity on a very recently submerged track.  The whole thing is mind-blowing. Tex: be careful with that rash.  I am concerned b/c it is spreading.  Take a pic of it and email to the docs office.  I just want someone to put your mind at ease.   Please keep us posted on how everything goes this week.  Felis: How are you feeling today?  Back problems are horrifying.  I have sciatica but I did not realize that to have sciatica automatically means you also have a disc problem.  I don\u2019t take anything for it but it has definitely been activated since the surgery.  Alas we live to fight another day ;) Sptmm: you are totally NOT whining.  One of my boob drains, the left, was so sore and wicked uncomfortable that the VNA kept calling to see if I could get in to have it removed early.  Finally when they were able to reach someone they were told my appt that was 10 days from discharge, stands.  Geesh\u2026it was so red and it burned and it hurt.  That might have been the worst pain of all.  It hurt like crazy. I worked with a guy in NYC who was uber wealthy and had probably one of the top 20 coolest houses in Manhattan.  He also had a place on Fire Island.  For the most part the Fire Island folks can handle a rebuild! It is just such a travesty, money aside, that all the memories and these beautiful homes gone.  In one of the shorefront communities in CT a homeowner, who lost her house last year and was just rebuilding, was interviewed upon her return to the home this time.  She did the right thing this time which is build it on 10\u2019 high concrete pillars and that is the correct way.  Our weather pattern has changed now and the shorefronts are going to look different.  Gone are the days of walking out your front door onto the sand.  It is just so sad b/c we could not have been less prepared in the Northeast for such loss.  Like Christie said, Mother Nature fired a warning shot.  Time for us to get smart about how we build shorefront homes. As for Queens, I considered, albeit briefly (I don\u2019t like living on top of others!!!), moving to the area.  That was a tight-knit, very close community and at the time I knew a number of people that lived there and it was just a fun place to be.  The parties were great and it was a fun place to visit.  It was the fires that leveled that area.  Same thing here in CT: in Old Greenwich, Old Saybrook and I think Westbrook houses burned.  It is all so heartbreaking.  I hope you are having some \u201crelief\u201d on the other issue!!!  Glad you are feeling so well.  I would say for the first month, I was in no position to say I was feeling ok.  Then again, I was rehospitalized with the belly drain and blah blah..!  Mine was a saga, as per usual! I am glad we are living in a time when there are nearly new positive developments on bc almost every week.  Thankfully it is becoming less and less perplexing to those in the medical field with each development.   What I am not so happy about is something I was alerted to on Twitter last night.  There was a USA Today article on the \u201csexualization\u201d of bc: http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/30/patients-decry-sexualization-of-breast-cancer/1630911/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=t.co This is just beyond understanding.  I can\u2019t figure this out at all.  I don\u2019t even have the mental capacity to imagine what kind of filth could do such a thing.  I know it takes all kinds and we need the lowlifes so we can recognize the *non* lowlifes but boy, this I found startling.  Who messes with people with cancer?  I guess those that want cancer.  The \"Bank of Karma\" is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and people that like to \"eff\" with people who have cancer are on a direct path to find out just how awful it is.  Let's see how smart they are or how entertained they are by their terrible behavior when they have no hair and are puking their brains out, wondering what disease will do next.  Good luck to those that spit in the wind. As for us, like I said to Felis, we live to fight another day so always take the high road and never get mired in negativity and may the road rise to meet you and the wind be at your back....NO, I am not going to go into the whole poem!!! Good day, chickies!",

What can happen is you will get stomach sick when you lose weight and I remember time and time again, upon weight loss, my body would go into a flu-like state replete with a minor bronchitis.  I have brought this up with docs and the bottom line is it seems basically like my body is throwing a fit.  Clearly it does not know what is good for it!  I am just letting you know this b/c weight loss could be causing your stomach upset.  So much I will never, ever understand! ",

It is absolutely imperative you stay far, far, far away from anyone that sucks your spirits out of you.  I remember that mess with what I now know to be your SIL.  Stay far away from the evil bitches.  Who the hell is somebody to remark on how you look and the fact that you are not laying down crying about bc is a sign you don\u2019t have it?  People are sick.   You really need to stay around people that support you and take care of you.  That is it.  Avoid the negativity.  That is entirely the last thing you need. On the VCR, my embarrassment grows: I have **3**!!   I also have 4 DVD players!  So sad!    I hardly ever use these things which is why I still have them.  The VCRs are working fine but should I have to do any head cleaning, I could not buy the stuff anywhere.  I am sure if you google it will tell you it is one part alcohol and 2 parts water.  Ginger: so funny on \u201cXanadu.\u201d  There was a teenage nightclub some of us went to when I was like 13 and it was called Xanadu.  My stepsister accidentally danced with her cousin!! She did not know it was even her cousin!   In any case, I do remember that movie.  I tweeted Jane Fonda about rereleasing her workouts on DVD.  No response!   Her workouts are just fabulous and timeless classics. Consequently, and for the record, you are a very nice woman.  You are very big hearted and all the work you have done, under the auspices of altruism and selflessness, is a badge of honor and those people were lucky to have you.   BTW, I am with Tex, did not know about a bear!  We have had a number of bear issues in CT over the past year.  It is very anomalous also. Lady: I hope you have a wonderful trip!  Good for you as it is nice to get away especially when you are going to see an old friend.  The best. Felis: exactly how you are feeling is pretty much how we all felt during chemo.  I felt like I had a constant cold.  How is your breast doing?  Still hurt?  Is the infection clearing?  Make sure you take the antibiotics as prescribed as problems with an infected breast can sneak right up on you during chemo.   Did you get the liver yet?  Should I stop asking you questions?!?!?!   Sptmm: did you see how the runners that showed for the (non) marathon made good use of their time?  Such good work out there.  You know, we have govt and bureaucracy but in the end, we have each other and that is showing more than ever. Well I am back to listening to The Verve \u201cLucky Man!\u201d  This is such a great song.  Be good to yourselves, ladies ;)  AND MAKE SURE YOU ****VOTE***** TOMORROW! ",

Leash laws protect human beings as well as dogs.  There is no shortage of property in West Hartford for people to let their dogs roam in their own backyard.  I felt really bad for the dog and the owner for that matter but I also feel bad for the bear.  My cat loves a certain window so I put a perch there for her.  What I then do is put out bread and seeds for the birds and I call it \"Kitty Broadway.  Well she goes crazy when she sees the birds and I know full well if she went out it is within her nature to scare a birds and mice to death.  The chipmunks seem to like her, though, which does not make much sense.  Bottom line is it is w/in her nature to do such things.

There are subtle changes in her demeanor.   I am sure news is forthcoming.  Something is going on there.  My mother loved her and Wolf Blitzer.  Someone on Twitter said with each additional glass of wine, and the closer Obama got to winning, they found themselves referring to Wolf as Santa! As for the gas drama, you jokers from NY and NJ have created a mess here is CT with your gas lines!!!!  In all of FF County, lines have been berserk on the 95 corridor and no less than an hour.  Alas, we are happy to wait on line with our gasless brethren!!! Tex: I hope and pray every day you will move to the NY metro area!!!!!  Every day!!!!!  There are great, great, great hospitals for you here!  Did you see the houses on SI and in Queens?   Those were largely inhabited by NYPD and Fire.  Your dh could make really good money in his field in this area and your benies will be unbelievable.  Also, should you ever want to make the move, I know I could find you a house w/in commutable distance of NY for a decent price.  Just let me know!  Times Sq is so much fun and I wish I had gone last night.  My friend in NYC wanted me to come in but it was not perfectly clear Obama would win.  I just get nervous b/c the race was going to be so tight and if Romney won, I was concerned about a problem starting.   NY is Obama country as is CT.  What I found particularly entertaining is when Stephanopolous remarked how Obama took Mitt\u2019s home states of MA, MI and NH!!!!!     Needless to say, I am enthralled!  I vote split ticket all the time but there was no way Mittens was getting my vote!  NO-WAY!  All I know is we are on the very difficult path to socialized medicine and whether I live to see its completion or not, it is good for our country and soon we can all be like Rachel and Sweeney!!!   All I know is we will pay more taxes but at least women getting bc long after I am gone will not have to worry about copays, burning through retirement funds, losing their house, going broke, losing their cars, being told they cannot get treated b/c they don\u2019t have XYZ insurance etc\u2026 and all in the name of trying to SURVIVE this crappy disease they did nothing to get.  OK, I am done\u2026for now!!!!! He he he!!  So many great political orators have said something like \u201chealthcare is a right, not a privilege.\u201d  This is my position.  Bottom line is Times Sq was an exciting place to be last night as well as in 2008 so your dh is a lucky man for having witnessed history from such a great place. It is tree time!!!!!  I love the Christmas tree!!!!  Just love it!!  Love the decorations and love that tree!

I hope you all are doing well.     I have been doing some thinking and I have to come clean with you all!  I have been dealing with some scary stuff.  I have a massive lump in my left breast that was scaring me dreadfully but I wanted to get through the holiday and so I waited to get it checked out.  I also had a mass in my lower abdomen that I did suspect was scar tissue but one never knows after a cancer dx.  Add to this the 3 holes in my body that seemed to refuse to heal for over 2 months now and I have been a wreck speculating about what my immune system was busy doing and why these things were not healing. Bottom line, it appears to be fluid but they don\u2019t know where the fluid is coming from or how it got there.   More to come on this as I go thorugh an echocardiogram, xrays, bloodwork and off to scanville soon thereafter.  In any case, it got me thinking: what am I worried about? I have cancer and there is no changing that.  Cancer symptoms come and go and it is very much a lifelong disease.  It also got me thinking how lucky all of us are to be getting close to celebrating 3 years since dx.  Some people don\u2019t get 3 months from dx.  We are all hitting our stride with this disease meaning we have found an efficient and sustainable manner of dealing with this disease.  This is the fabric of our lives now and when mets/recurrence arrives, which invariably it will, we will just deal with it.  It is most likely going to happen to most of us at some point or another and I just feel that I will have enough time to be dead when I die and I need not waste valuable time preparing for it!!!  Every day is a gift, people. I do realize, however, that with most of us coming up on our 3 year since dx, it is easy to fall back into some old habits.  Sptmm reminded me recently that she read that exercising 4-7 hours per week greatly reduces risk of recurrence and we all know she has embraced that avoidance factor!  I have also been studying why the Chinese, living in China, and why they have such lower rates of cancer than we do.  Of course, modern med and are they getting dxd early/at all before expiration is always a factor but the fact remains Chinese and Japanese people do not suffer our cancer rates until they move West (of course they then become a part of our population subject to our treatment and statistics).  The one thing they largely do not eat is dairy.  I found that interesting.  In any case, the little changes we might make as we hit the 3 year mark is to renew our \u201cvows\u201d to a better lifestyle, revisit consuming those dark, leafy greens, exercise a little more and make sure to do our best to maintain immune system health.  Another issue is cancer can only thrive in a body with a depressed immune system so for people like Rachel and I suffering thyroid issues, we have to be extra careful and for all of you, get your rest, sleep, stretch and try to keep stress to an absolute minimum.  Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff!  Immune system health must be maintained!! Finally, fertile ground for luck is when preparedness meets opportunity.  If we celebrate our 3 year anniversaries with verve and revisit some of the lifestyle changes we put in place right after dx, who knows?  Or perhaps there are some changes we can yet make? Our preparedness might meet with opportunities that don\u2019t even exist yet.  This is all part of the good fight and you need to remind yourself if cancer wants to go into the ring with you again, you are going to put on your gloves and fight!  Continue on with little lifestyle changes *not* because we think we can control cancer through changes but because we are trying to help ourselves.  Finally, remember Timothea, that lovely Texasrose we are all blessed to have gotten to know and who knocks this disease down over and over and over and over again!  She is the inspiration from which we all draw!  Rachel: congratulations on losing 18 lbs!!!!!  I am looking forward to your post when you tell use you are at pre-dx weight!   Good times to come, sister! BTW, I, too, am a last minute shopper!   I find it fun! The lunch time walks are a great idea.   I know it is cold but you should warm up after the first few minutes\u2026well 10\u2026well maybe not at all!  It is still a great way to spend your lunch so good for you! Sorry to hear about your boss\u2019s wife but you are right, every where you turn someone is being dxd with this damn disease.  I never heard of clear cell.  I was just talking to a friend who told me 3 months ago his father was being checked out for cancer.  I asked him last week how his father was and he said he died a few weeks prior.  I cannot believe this disease. It is just flabbergasting. Sptmm: I am cruising along.  I am nervous about the upcoming scans etc\u2026 and about these back issues and numbness in my hands not to mention where that fluid is coming from but I have to take it all one step at a time!  As for falling asleep, after that surgery sleep was my favorite so I understand why you did not get out to any stores!!  That surgery takes a lot out of us but it is definitely a great option, I agree. Tex: good for you on sending the trouble makers to sleep early!!  I am sure they needed it after a week off and a return to school today! I am beyond excited you are feeling better!  This is the ***best*** news ever!!!  I am so glad you finally got that med and are feeling better.  Chemo, of course, is hard on the stomach but we all know the upside to it! Felis: it seems like we are in the same boat, woman!  Only think is your fluid issue is more painful than mine!  You were meant to come and join our thread so we can support and guide each other in this mutual experience across the miles!  Our situation is eerily similar!   Please let me know what they find out from the US.  Did the dr mention LE? I am so glad your last tx is Dec 14!! Good times, woman!  Good times, indeed.  It is great they put you on IV antibiotics.  It is just faster and works more efficiently than pills and you are at a point where I think you needed that. The Good Wishes wrap is such a nice gesture on that part of that company and they are pretty, too!  That is just so nice.  I am glad you are doing better today.  Keep us posted on your US results and good luck tomorrow.  Today when I was leaving the PS office she said, in regards to my concern about mets/recurrence and that mysterious lump in my chest, that I have every right to be concerned b/c my cancer was a bad one!  I know there is no such thing as a good one, and all my docs knew mine was a bad one but my little ears were never exposed to such words!  Alas the facts are the facts. OMG\u2014I was researching nitrates and meat and found this rather funny acid test for meat consumption from some joker: A good rule is look at the animal when it is alive.   Does a pig or cow look healthy?  Nope but deer, fish and chicken all do! That is all, that is all!!!!!!!  Sweet dreams to everyone and to all a good, restful night :)",

It is cold here today but it is nice nonetheless.  I like the seasons and I like it cold at Christmas! Rachel:  You & Ladyinbama have had new primaries and Tex with mets, you all seem to all be handling it well so I look to you for inspiration ;)   By well I don\u2019t mean you all don\u2019t have your breakdowns and your moments but I think overall you all set a fine example of how to smile in the face of pretty tough adversities.  I don\u2019t think about cancer too much but when I start getting weird headaches, losing feeling, albeit intermittently, in both arms, numbness and tingling in hands, a lump in my lower abdomen, a lump in the breast where the cancer was before and neck and back pains, I do start to think about cancer again!!!  I don\u2019t know why?!?!?!!!  The busiest of lives would not deliver me from cancer thoughts under these circumstances!!! You are right, however, in that unless somebody asks, it is not front-and-center anymore. I am very grateful for this thread and that we all have stuck together!  It feels good and I love this little group. Tex: there is a special place in hell for people like those in that Denver suburb who thought up this capitalistic pig plan to make money on bc with their dumbass t-shirts and I don\u2019t know what DNA one must have to even comfortably go there.  It frightens me to think about the (no doubt) liquored up meeting where, what I hope are frat boys, came up with this idea but it is sad.  I would really hate to find out women are running this business.  I will investigate!  It is all ill-gotten money so no good will come from it.   Fate will take care of them! Ginger: I am going to my onc in the next few weeks, have a laundry list of things to discuss and not the least of which is that headache.  Thank you, though, for encouraging me to reach out to my onc.  I think you probably have the impression by now I might very well ignore what I would later find out to be a caveat, shrugging it off as nothing to be concerned about and you would be right!! Did you have a good holiday?  Did you give your beautiful dogs some turkey?!  How was your dgd?  My great niece went to a farm in CT with her dad to see colored turkeys.  One of them pecked her through the fence and she responded by saying \u201cI cook you!!!\u201d  She is 1 ½ years old!!  Funniest thing: in Northern CT there were some wild turkeys on a main road that had traffic stopped and were attacking the cars, pecking at the doors etc\u2026 and when people lowered their car windows, the turkeys were pecking them through the open window!!!!  You can come up with your own punch lines!  The media had a lot of fun with it as it was a few days before Thanksgiving. So Dr. Oz is back on my radar!  I do so love him!  In any case, the other day the talk from Deepak Chopra, Oz\u2019s guest, was Amalaki (for constipation), black currant jam (I think this was to help with memory) and Acorn and butternut squash.  I looked up a recipe for Acorn and butternut squash soup so I will let you all know how I feel after my power lunch of soup, black currant jam on wheat crackers and a bit of amalaki!     MESSAGE TO YOU ALL: If you have a Paypal account, by now you know they are NOT a bank, although they act like a bank and have all banking properties. In any case, they sent out an email to all of us with accounts telling us if we did not opt-out, going forward we would be relegated to arbitration-only in the event we had a problem with them and their (often times) mishandling of our money.  Basically they are taking your legal rights away/right to sue.  I am not going to go too far on this but THIS IS BAD.  This is bad for the holders of Paypal accounts and if anyone wants instructions on how to tell them you are not complicit, PM me.   I will give instructions through PM.  You all can only imagine that this is bad for us as why would they wait until the beginning of the very busy holiday season to tell us and then make it necessary to respond by mail, using certain language, to opt-out and that it must be sent w/return receipt and delivery confirmation ***BY DECEMBER 1ST**?  Exactly.  Not good!  Also, they did not provide instructions on **how** to opt-out!  I had to do a lot of research to find out exactly what to do.  What a mess.   Happy trails, girls! ",

I hope you all are doing well.  These are busy times, girls!  I had to go for a chest xray today (process of elimination on what the big mass is!) and a few things occurred to me that I wanted to share with you all: President Clinton broke his ass getting HIPPA through and not for us all to walk into these places and have them arbitrarily hand over forms that state basically we are waiving all our HIPPA rights.  You know, the lawyers draft these forms and the non-legal helpers behind the counter have to \u201csell\u201d the patients on this.  I started talking with this woman today who said \u201coh, it is to protect you!!!!!!!\u201d  When I read it, all it said was you are waiving ***every*** right you have under HIPPA.  I would encourage you all not to sign those forms.  I am not signing away my HIPPA rights anymore.  It is ridiculous as if you are to take the time to read what they are putting forth, it basically says they can give all of your information basically to anyone they darn well wish.   That is exactly what HIPPA was designed to stop.  I am no longer signing over my rights! This part will make you all laugh: I went in and the rad tech was checking my chest, feeling for where the lump was.  I went in for the xray and as I am getting dressed back in the changing room I hear her come out and say \u201cit is not in your lungs!!!!!!!\u201d   I did not even want to mention all the problems with this statement!  First, if it was in my lungs, I would not be able to touch it!  Second, if it grew from my lung, out my ribcage and into my breast, it might not even be cancer but more likely is titanium!!!  Furthermore, they were not chest xraying me to find out if it was in my lungs but rather to better determine the composition of the \u201cbig mass!!!!!\u201d   I know she meant well but I guess after being in this system for so long, I do find myself entertained quite a lot!!   I did not say anything to her but said \u201coh great\u201d and chuckled to myself!  Rachel: may you have a wonderful week also!  We had snow here, a little dusting.  No big deal.  I think it is pretty and I do like the seasons and if I did not, I would be living in FL!  The older I get, however, the more I think about FL et al as I can\u2019t go north, that is for sure!   Tex: I heard it was wicked hot in TX these past few days!  Enjoy your tan, girl!   I know, no tan for you right now!  I am so glad you are feeling so much better.  That is my Christmas gift this year ;) You all are going to think I have gone mad but I had the most vivid dream I was having relations with our President the other night!!!  I guess it is his bad boy image as we are careening over the fiscal cliff, that has me interested!!!!!  I woke up stunned!  The last thing I remember was we were laughing, doing cartwheels in the Rose Garden!!!!  What a crazy dream and I never remember my dreams, ever! Well I hope you all are well.  I have my onc appt coming up and surely I will be quickly dispatched to scan land!  I am going to draw on my inner 60s (even though I was not alive!) protestor and whine \u201chell no, I won\u2019t go!!!!!\u201d  God help us!!!  Good day, girls",

It is the \u201cex\u201d season again!  So funny how they come around again\u2026only now with this bc nonsense I think it is to check and see if I am still kickin\u2019! Actually, and I think I have said this before, not too many people know and I try to keep it that way but it is so funny at this time of the year. Tex: I think I might have told you I studied Chinese and I speak Japanese.  When I saw your signature tag my mind was jumping because I can read a lot of things in Japanese and understand what the meaning is in Chinese.  In any case, there is also Gaelic in there and I was just floored!  I was staring for about a minute wondering what was going on!!!!!  It does not take much these days.  More to this point, I am not quick with my Jeopardy answers anymore either.  I keep playing all these word, scramble and trivia games but I tell you, chemo took away some of my sharpness!  My IQ tested off the chart and now it is probably off the chart in the other direction!!  In any case, thank you for jogging that unit in my hat rack! Yes, your life in pink!  You are the best!  I adore your spirit like nothing else in this world and like I said, we all just keep tumbling through time with this disease and hope for the best.  These are auspicious times and I say that a lot but I think it needs to be said as there are new developments every day.  One never knows. I am so excited you are doing well and that med has helped you.  I know you don\u2019t celebrate but as far as I am concerned, your health is the best Christmas gift I could ever get ;) Tim, that is one heck of a long winter break for those kids!  Meanwhile back here in CT they are trying to add *300* hours to each school year!  The only vacation from school these kids will have is when they get the flu! Felis: it is  sooo hard to avoid getting sick when on chemo.  Get a lot of protein, vitamins, water and even call your onc to see if you can take ecchinacea.   Don\u2019t forget the soup!  I know how gross all food seems when on chemo so I apologize if the very thought of eating any of this is making you nauseous!  I hope you are feeling better and get through that last tx b/c believe it or not, the time comes when you actually have hair again, feel good again and slowly, albeit very slowly, distance yourself from this disease.  Hang in there!  Almost done! Omaz: winter break was my favorite of all!  Pockets of cash and off to the mall I went!  Returning, buying, listening to the very antiquated *album!*  I loved it even more after I got my car when I turned 16 b/c I could go to a lot of malls!  It was so much fun!  Then NYE and the partying!  Good times, good memories!  I bumped into an old friend a few nights ago (who finally asked me about my boobs!) and he was telling me about one NYE we were out and all the partying we did\u2026you know, sorry to say, I hardly remember!  Of course, while most of friends stayed in small town USA and got married etc\u2026 I took off to NYC and found that if I worked hard on Wall St I could play really hard and I did!  Perhaps this is why I did not remember the tale my old pal was telling me because of my voluminous experiences!   I am sure your dd is looking forward to a more traditional Xmas break and not one involving Animal House!! Rachel: Mexico is just one of my fav places to go!  Good for you!  In fact, I think that is in the cards next year although my friend just commandeered me for some trip to Italy where we shall cruise!  That is next Sept\u2026who knows but I might..?!   I can really just completely forget everything in Mexico and, yes, it does have something to do with tequila!  OMG, when I saw my friend the other night we were reminiscing of our obsession with the worm!  I was so juvenile\u2026and still am!!!  I really think some time at the equator, resting, is just what you need!  Are the kids going w/? Alright so now I am obsessed with getting an upgrade on my phone and I want that  Galaxy 3!!  I am 2 months off from upgrade date and I can\u2019t wait!  The phone I have now does not ring much, sends calls to voice mail w/out provocation and, worst of all, I can\u2019t MOVE TILES on Words With Friends anymore!!!!  It drops the tile ½ way and then I have to recall all and try again\u2026driving me crazy\u2026can\u2019t play anymore!  So sad!  I was remembering when I worked as a Financial Consultant for Bank of the Solar System (B of A!), we had to go on some party bus to a big meeting in Boston.  I remember talking to one of the other FCs on the bus and discussing our super exciting microscopic phones and he was complaining about how his fingers were too large to even dial all that well!  He was the funniest guy- when I asked him how he met his wife he said \"one too many ___ White Russians, Liz, don't get me started!!\"  In any case, all I can think is here we are again with these mammoth phones!  The new phones have great screens though and I only have 2 eyes and I can\u2019t get any more eyes so bigger is better!

I read a startling report a few nights ago about counterfeit cancer drugs\u2026not joking.

In talking with a friend this morning I realized what I have been trying to say about this gun business and how it relates to video games.  First off, 9/11 would have never been so successful if that dumbass in FL did not give them nealry unlimited access to the flight simulator.  More to this point, when most of us were young we knew who the kids were with social disorders as they did not come outside and play.  Now we have no idea who they are because the absolute norm is to be held up in one\u2019s home playing video games day and night.  We no longer know who the troubled kids are because of this social phenomena which has gripped our country, getting stronger year-by-year, for the past 15-20 years.  99% of the kids that play these games will not ever do anything but hiding among them now are the ones that do have problems and those problems are exacerbated by practicing on shooting games for thousands of hours.  Now life is unfortunately imitating electronic arts.  Finally, on the assault weapons, I did not realize they were so easy to get and I am not quite sure what place they have in our society or why they are being sold but much like a Lamborghini or a Ferrari, our highways are not designed to accommodate the speeds at which those cars are designed to travel.  Under the auspices of capitalism, however, people should be allowed to buy what they want.  Our schools are financially strapped, our teachers are grossly underpaid and therefore it is going to be very difficult to not profile children as they try to figure out who the problem shut-ins are and not just there goes another kid who plays video games every day after school. This is a terrible turn of events. Moving right along (!), a few days ago I saw on volunteer match that the ACS has created a position, volunteer of course, that dispatches a person into the cancer hospitals to reach out to cancer patients who have been just diagnosed to let them know of all the resources the ACS has for them.  I was stunned.  It seemed so pragmatic and I wondered how that happened as I find the ACS not too helpful at all.  It took me 7 phone calls to reach someone who had more information for me.  She told me they are only doing it in Hartford at this time.  Well, if any of you know anything about Hartford then you know the Gaza Strip might be considered safer!  I asked why not in all the cancer hospitals in CT and she said it was b/c the ACS is a non-profit and I guess a lot of these hospitals are considered and/or classified as non-profits and the hospitals don\u2019t want to be competing with the ACS for dollars etc\u2026 Sadly the ACS is viewed as competition.  That is one heck of a sad situation.  I guess now I know why we all, as bc patients, know very little about what the ACS has for us as they are shut out of most hospitals under the auspices of a non-compete sort of situation. If any of you ever had any questions as to why the ACS is not as ubiquitous as they should be, there you have it.  Money and nonsense, old as the dirt we walk on.",

      "Content": "Dec 28, 2012 11:14PM - edited Dec 28, 2012 11:19PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! Thanks, guys!  I am feeling a bit better today.  When I got to my docs office as he has afternoon walk-in hours, his waiting room was packed but that is not uncommon at this time of year.  I sat in his waiting room, and there are always nice people there and we all chat, thinking I am going to get \u201csicker\u201d sitting here.  Oddly, however, I started even feel a bit better in his office.  I explained I was taking Amoxicylin that I had here b/c I did not know if it was flu for sure.  He put me on a ZPak so I hope that works.  I am definitely not out of the woods but feeling better. Ladyinbama: stop in and let us know how you are.  I see AL had some serious tornadoes over the past few days and I am thinking of you and hope all is well. Tex: I am so sorry to hear about your feet.  How awful.   I can\u2019t think of anything worse as we need our feet for almost everything we do.  I am so glad that SE is going away-your feet of all things.  My poor, poor Timothea!  My heart breaks about what you go through.  I was briefly discussing your situation with the healthcare company recently to the people waiting to see my doc b/c healthcare came up.  They were so stunned that people w/cancer were being treated like that.  I explained that if you think it is bad, guess what? It can always get worse so I explained to them your attitude of gratitude and how positive you are mentally and they unanimously agreed your\u2019s will be a cancer success story for sure!  A lot of people truly believe how we respond to the problem is 9/10 of the battle.  On that note, you are going to do just  wonderfully!  One guy said year\u2019s ago, like when Felisa and I (and a number of others on this thread) were kids, cancer was all but certainly going to take you down.  He followed it up by saying now b/c they have come so far, it is not quite the awful dx it once was.  I mean there is nothing great about it but I truly believe our little group here is so special and mainly it is b/c we all have a positive mental attitude about this.  That is the healthiest thing any of us can do.  That and Sptmm who is now so svelte she most likely has to shop in the Juniors dept at Macy\u2019s!!!!!   Seriously, positive mental attitude and working out-that is a recipe for success and you encompass that totally, Timothea so in the great words of one of my teenage heroes I say \u201cParty on Wayne!!!!!!!\u201d Felisa: you have gone through what will surely be one of the hardest, if not *the* hardest thing you will ever go through in your life and the good news: IT  IS ALL UP HILL FROM HERE!!!!!!!   I give you a lot of credit b/c this was a real blow to your psyche but you muscled through and are still here, with us, with your family, with your dgd and still having a life for yourself and that means you have succeeded ;)  You seriously need to pat yourself on the back and then realize that it is all good from here on out.  I have a bunch of surgeries and somehow you just get through it.  I know you have surgery on Monday and I will be sending you the positive vibes all day and you will be fine.  It is all going to work out and you will be putting this behind you in no time flat.  Also, and one of the things I loved about getting passed chemo, by next December with the holiday season upon us, your hair will be back and you will be feeling strong and ready to celebrate!!   You have a lot to look forward to and just hang in there, go positive Monday and all will be fine.  You know what I love about my PS?  She has the sweetest, calmest demeanor ever and before the surgeries I have had w/her, she is in the OR and she has a very calming influence.  That helps me immensely.   It helps me and I am sure, as a surgeon, she knows that.  In any case, think all positive thoughts and you will bring positive spirits to you.  Tony Robbins, the major motivational speakers, calls it an attitude of gratitude so like Omaz was saying to think of just one thing every day that inspires your or helps you change your state of mind, it is really energizing and it trains your mind to think good things because your mind gets trained that those thoughts have a good impact on your body.  It is all one big circle so have that attitude of gratitude, woman!   You know something: one thing I was always grateful for was the fact we live in the US where women are respected and we get healthcare and good doctors etc.. .unlike if we were women living in Kabul, for instance.  That helps me remember that even though bc is a very tough thing to deal with I remember how much worse it could be and it keeps me grateful to be a woman in the US battling this disease as opposed to so many other places in this world.  You know, Felisa, whatever it takes.  Just think of some positive thoughts every day.  Also, if you journal your thoughts, you are going to see how far you are going to come in just a few months.  It is all up from here!!! Jane Fonda: she is one of my heroes!  I love her, I idolize her.  She was on Katie a few weeks ago.  Not only does she look fantastic and she is mentally as strong as ever.  I did so many of her workout tapes and loved her \u201cLower Body Workout\u201d and a few other step workouts.  Nothing, however, was as challenging as the striped body suit tape!  That was quite a workout.  In any case, it was so good to see her looking great and feeling good and what did she reveal: that she has bc.  She has joined our dubious club.  I don\u2019t know, I just still find her very inspirational.  What a spirit she has. Winter wonderland tomorrow here!   ½ a foot.  Sptmm will most likely be jogging in the snow with her new boobs, making all the men crazy!!!   I will be thinking of you, Deb!   I am going to get out my cross country skis and hope to get a little action in tomorrow!  The snow is difficult for travel for sure but it is so beautiful though!  Night, girls-",

Felisa: I am so glad you stayed with us even when I tried to show you to the 2012 chemo group!  You and I have an awful lot in common with what we have been through/are going through.  I have to tell you, though, you have come so far and have dealt with so much and just seem to be doing better and better every day! I am so happy for you!  I will always be here for you and we will travel this road together for the rest of our lives as is the nature of the big \"C!\"  Much love, woman and hang in there as this coming summer we must make hay!! That sun will be shining for us and good times shall abound! We both have a lot of lost time to make up for!  Good times for us this summer!  Good times, indeed!  Keep eating that pineapple!  I am doing the same...and don't hesitate to try that Dr. Oz green drink!  It is good!  Tex: I find the entire auto industry so dubious!  I must admit, some girls like shoes, some girls like clothes and I like cars!  Over the years, sourcing parts on Ebay etc... I find the disparity in pricing outrageous!  Like, for instance, recently I was looking for certain parts and the prices were crazy on Ebay and it makes me wonder if the cheapest is not the worst as is the case w/most things.  I don't know but I am sure glad you A)have the guy at the station that will do work on the cheap and B)were able to find the part at an \"Auto Zone\" for a decent price.  Sometimes when I look at these prices I wonder if these people on Ebay realize we can see the other merchants as well w/significantly lower prices?!  Well, recently I was tapped by someone from the event when I did that speech to help w/a fundraiser (silent auction) and have gotten some great places to donate some neat items!  I am hoping it goes well as this woman is sick and her child also has cancer.  All I know is I love receiving these boxes with the donated items!  It is like Xmas!  The auction is in 3 weeks.   Today I was driving in a rural part where there is a gun range.  I saw school buses in the parking lot and it seems adults are coming in by bus loads, scampering off to classes so they can get firearms before legislation rolls in!  Itis just crazy. Also, a few miles before the range some guy was tailgating so I just pulled over to let him pass and sure enough he was racing to the gun range!!  A little unnerving...! Sweet dreams, girls! ",

      "Content": "Feb 24, 2013 04:53PM - edited Feb 24, 2013 04:58PM by 1WonderWoman Ginger: my spin on increased hot flashes is based on the fact that hot flashes are caused by hormonal changes of menopause.  A diminished level of estrogen has a direct effect on the hypothalamus which controls body temp among other things.  Somehow the drop in estrogen confuses the hypothalamus and makes it read too hot.  The brain responds by broadcasting this alert to the heart, blood vessels etc.. telling them to \u201cget rid of the heat.\u201d  The message is delivered instantly and then sweat glands release sweat to cool us off.  This heat releasing mechanism is how the body keeps us from overheating but when the brain gets confused by a drop in estrogen, this causes these wonderful hot flashes. Meanwhile tamoxifen is binding with breast cell receptors which prevent the estrogen from binding and blocks cell proliferation.  If I am eating foods that increase estrogen production I am thereby increasing the job of tamoxifen.  It then has more estrogen to deal with.  This would mean my hot flashes will be increasing because tamoxifen is fighting off estrogen and as my brain gets a message that estrogen levels have dropped, I am getting hot flashes because my estrogen is dropping more frequently because I am attempting to add estrogen nutritonally.  So I am increasing my level nutritionally and then tamox is fighting it back down = more hot flashes.  The body just knows there is a \"drop\" in estrogen but from what level that drop occurs, the body does not know.  All tamox knows is it has a bigger job to do if I am eating foods that increase estrogen and then the body just keeps knowing these higher levels of estrogen I have caused with nutrition are being fought back down by tamox.  If I am getting more hot flashes I assume I am somehow inadvertently causing estrogen cell proliferation (most likely nutritionally), causing more tamoxifen fighting cycles and thus more hot flashes.  Of course, I only live in this house\u2026I really don\u2019t know what is going on!  The parsley in the Oz drink is a food that is on the list of foods to help increase estrogen production.  This is why I come to the conclusion I am nutritionally increasing my hot flash production! Yeah, I know what you mean about the \u201csocialized\u201d shopping experience!  I was minding my business, walking out of the store and we all know how those curbs are sloped to allow for ease of cart navigation and it was where the curb is sloping upwards where I tripped and fell b/c I was distracted by the employee addressing me.  It is so cold here nowadays I am surprised anyone is even interested in stalling at all to chat in the darn parking lot anyway!  Meanwhile I still fail to have much range of motion on that arm and won't know until Monday if it is broken, sprained, fractured or what.  It hurts into my shoulder something awful when I raise it as one would if they were doing the \"chicken dance!\" Iowa: As for the bloodwork, apparently the prevailing wisdom is there is no need to scan and/or do blood work looking for recurrence.  I personally find this ludicrous but that is where we are at.  Dr. Lin of Dana Farber commented on one of the bc sites regarding what tests should be done after dx to check for recurrence and the answer is none!  I know, I am surprised as well.  The one test that keeps being mentioned in my research is CA15-3/CA27.29.  That test measures blood levels of cancer antigens and which, if elevated, can indicate recurrence. I think I speak for all of us when I say we are completely anxious with this post dx + tx lack of testing.  It is so hard not to know, and to have no idea at all, what is going on in our bodies where sneaky cancer is most likely lurking.  IMO, this is tantamount to catching us only at critical mass.  In my situation now, I am undergoing tests for mets that a doctor completely (and I mean completely) removed from my cancer circle found the issue at hand.  I honestly think we are just going to find mets by chance.  In fact, I seriously think our doctors try to move us away from thinking about mets and tests as a function of helping us establish greater mental health about the entire issue.  Of course, until you have cancer, one will never know how much fear it instills especially when it is a very sneaky disease and this hands off, lack-of-testing mentality does not engender widespread comfort among us bc girls.  It is all so odd. So that is what they are looking for and if they don\u2019t test CA15.3+27.29 directly, all the other blood they are taking at our quarterly or semiannual check-ups is most likely giving them a similar, and perhaps more definitive, picture of what those tests measure.  This is all we can think, right?! Lady: I am sorry you did not get the job but don't worry!!!  You will get a job soon enough.  When out knocking on doors, there is an \"n\" factor (no factor) and at some point you will know, and for future reference, how many \"no's\" you must get to receive a *yes!!!* ",

Happy Superbowl  Sunday!!!  I hope everyone is doing well ;) Tex: don\u2019t ever say that!  You are such a beautiful person!  Sadly there are many, many people who should be getting on their way, off of this planet, but not you, woman!!  I will put money on saving your beautiful life and keeping your lovely soul among us every day of the week!  BTW, first on the should-depart list: a guy I worked with on Wall St I called \u201cno soul\u201d as he was a convicted pedophile and that while drunk driving committed vehicular homicide.  Indeed we need many, many more Timothea\u2019s and far, far less \u201cno souls!\u201d   Money, shmoney anyway!  Is there a better way to spend money than on saving your beautiful life?!  ;)  The barn is in Durham, CT.  I am just not sure of the structural soundness or how someone might move it but there are always those large flat bed trucks they move modular homes on.  Who knows?!  On the sleepwalk eating, so common.  I am always surprised when the likes of 20/20 runs a show on that and uncovers the stats.  Perhaps you are just wanting a middle-of-the-night snack! Omaz: Adey was drawing Felis\u2019s attention to the recipe for the Dr. Oz green drink I have been telling her to try!  Not too much cutting.  I take 1 huge bowl, dump ½ bag of spinach in there (save other for next time make drink), cut an orange, lime and lemon all in ½ (saran wrap the other halves for next drink), toss in bunch parsley and mint, break 3 stalks off celery bunch(take an additional 3 off for next time make drink and then I cut the rest of the head into snack sticks!),  take 3 carrots (I pull another 3 carrots out bag and then cut the rest into snack sticks) and the only real cutting is the pineapple as the cucumber goes in whole also.  I also put in about 2\u201d of ginger root.  #goodstuff !!!  You are right, my body does not like surgery! It has had enough.  It did ok for like the first 4 or 5 surgeries but has not been happy since!  Glad you got a nap and good to hear from you! Sptmm: you are such a trooper!  Heading to the gym in the snow! Yes, I am still working with metal.  I made a great coat rack recently and this year I plan to make **3** of the Wall St themed bar tables.  That will be the most I ever made.  How are you healing?  How is work going? Felis: thank you for joining us!  I am glad you came and joined in with us and found some people that know exactly what you are going through to assist you on your journey. I have said it a thousand times, we are all just dotted lines to each other.  Rachel: never been to Iceland!  My friends dd did a semester there a few years back.   BTW, watching a show on CPTV on Quebec right now!  Quaint downtown colorful row houses!  I have not been to Montreal in 7 years, Toronto in 5 years and Quebec since I was very, very young w/grandma!   I think I am going to do some Canada tripping this summer! Ginger: it is hard enough to not spend when awake!  If I was half asleep, surely I could be tricked into buying most anything!! Well, time to get ready for the Superbowl!!!!!  I do love the commercials!  Carpe Diem, ladies! ",

I am so glad you are getting a house!!!!  Good for you.  No more flaky neighbors sharing your walls!  The other night I was talking to someone who said they lived in an apt and said \"it is so nice when you can hear your neighbors fart!!!!\"   An old friend from college lives in Brooklyn and her neighbors are constantly fighting.  She said  the other night \"we have to break up, this is not working!\"  Finally, when I was young my father liked to take us to the dentist 3xs a  year at least (was fanatic about keeping up w/our teeth) and his dentist said to me once \"Elizabeth, you know why I live in Old Saybrook?\"  I said no as I was maybe 16 and he said \"so I don't ever have to see my neighbors!!!!\"   Sharing walls/floors is just too much and you will be much happier!   Best of luck to you in your house search! On corporate greed and tossing things, you know why they do that?  Because it is very hard to organize \"pick ups\" for the stuff and then people don't show and then you have food and/or other items hanging around etc..  and no way to store it.  As much as you think people will scramble to get something free, it is not the case.  Also they never know what they will be giving away so w/out consistency, there is no manangement.  I know ostensibly it is a shame but you just can't manage things like that.  My friend owned a bakery which is why I know this!  Also, the other problem is if people get used to the idea you are \"giving it away after 7PM\" they won't make purchases but rather wait for the freebies.  Dunkin Donuts are all over the Northeast and they toss a bunch of crap at end of night to avoid attracking rodents (or more rodents!!).  On a more positive note, I was at the package store a few nights ago and there was a student in their getting boxes for moving so check your local package store!!! Glad the kids are feeling better and your niece is home. Very good to hear from you!  Best of luck in your home search!  It is so exciting to get a new home!  Enjoy it, girl!",

I hope everybody is doing well!  I am having the strangest dreams.  More importantly I had one that cars were flying!  Not joking\u2026I suspect the future is knocking on my head in the night!  I think eventually it will all be like the Jetson\u2019s anyway! OMG\u2026the other night I stopped in a parts store to pick up a part for one of my cars and the lady that works there is very cool.  I know her as I am in there regularly\u2026as I like cars!  She looks at my credit card and said \u201coh, I had a friend that actually looked a lot like you and same last name.\u201d  I said the name did not ring a bell but in this part of the country, lots of the Irish and Italians are related etc\u2026 so it is not uncommon for this kind of conversation to take place (for those of you who might find this peculiar!!).  In any case, she tells me she misses her friend so much and I asked if she moved away; no, she died of bc last year at the age of 42!!  Ugh, I felt a little punched in the stomach.  Of course she does not know of my situation.  She showed me a pic of the woman in question and all I could think was we do/did look alike and how very young she looked. Rachel: \u201cOh Canada\u201d indeed!!!!!  Bench clearing brawl at that baseball game!!!  I saw it on Sports Center!!  Oh yes, good times!!!  He he he!!  How are you?  Hope all is well. Sptmm: good for you!  So happy you are happy with your results and life is back to normal! I think that is the best feeling.  The fundraiser went well.  It was a silent auction.  It appears several thousand dollars was raised for her.  She is going to be very very surprised and very, very happy!   I don\u2019t know about you but I am all \u201csurgeried\u201d out!  I really can\u2019t think of doing anything else.  I am just tired of it all and hope I get a break. Valerie Harper was on Piers Morgan tonight.  I am so sorry I missed the interview.  I mean to tell you about it.  All I am going to say is that woman is amazing and put a very valiant face on cancer in all of her public appearances as of late.  She and Jane Fonda are my heroes.  I am so happy she is out there and saying it like it is and is wicked strong in the face of adversity.  Her death is around the corner and this woman is fine and has made peace with it and very much so it seems.  Women are such strong creatures. So, Deb, indeed cancer does continue to get the \u201cgood ones.\u201d  Tex: you are such a trooper, I love it!  I am hoping you are feeling ok, that your SEs are minimal, that your scan results are good and that this house search does not stress you too much!  House hunting is a big pain-in-the-arse (it is St. Pat\u2019s week\u2026!) and it is so hard.  I know several who took a break from it for a while.  I have a few friends that are professionals (one a lawyer, one is in medicine) and are so saddle bagged w/student loans, even with impeccable credit and having been out of school for many years, the student loans are so high they can\u2019t buy homes!  Be happy you are not in that awful position. So there I was in Target getting some St. Pat\u2019s stuff in the $1 baskets and this woman was asking me if I had seen any glow sticks.  We talked for a  few minutes as she was very pleasant and my favorite age (over 70 + grandma-ish!) so then out of nowhere she says \u201cso how are you doing?\u201d Of course congruent with my comedic nature I tell her I can\u2019t offer up a definitive clinical diagnosis but I think I am ok!!   She says \u201cno, with cancer\u201d and I was stunned. She said she saw my \u201cpic line\u201d scar!  I was stunned but remember I told you all I was worried about that scar being the scarlet letter for all of us? In any case, she said if you are a healthcare professional, most will know what that scar is from and if every person in this country who has cancer gets a port, everyone will know that scar means because roughly 1 in 2 is getting some kind of cancer.  She made a good point.  Needless to say, I was stunned when she pointed that out.  Her son is my age, has 4 fairly young kids and is S4 pancreatic.  She, in fact, was S4 bladder in the 70s and is now 75 y/o!  Now that is ah-mazing! Got me thinking about cancer and I have a new theory: everyone gets cancer. I think every person gets cancer but the body gets rid of it. I believe that those of us who they \u201ccatch\u201d it fall into the medical industrial complex in which they are studying the disease through \u201cus.\u201d  We are experimental subjects.  Of course people are dying from cancer every day but Tony Snow, former White Houser, said before he died that he did not think he was dying of cancer but rather cancer treatment. Therein lies the issue.  I mean once you find out you have it you have to go get txs, that is that.  I just wonder about all the uninsured who are not getting checked out and who are most likely getting cancer at one point or another.  I mean going back 100s of years people have been dying from \u201cmysterious lumps\u201d but I seriously think all people get cancer at some point in their lives and some people are caught in the medical industrial complex perusing of the citizens of the world so as to test, treat and study us and others their body fights it off.  Unfortunately others are passing, treated or untreated, because the body, for whatever reason, was not as capable as other people\u2019s bodies to fight it off.  I still believe we live in auspicious times but I do believe either the future will say \u201cwe\u201d were over-treated or there will be understanding of how to manage a cancerous body, in some sort of a co-habitative way.  I mean we are seeing it today where S4 today is hardly what it was even 10 years ago.  We have come a long way, still have a ways to go, but have definitely come a long way. Good night, girls and the happiest of trails to you all :)",

Happy trails, girls\u2026.the CMAs are on and I don\u2019t know about you all but between that Blake Shelton and the Paisley guy etc\u2026 I find these country singers pretty good looking, so for that very shallow reason, I will be tuning in!!!!!",

This past week I ran into 4 people who all had buried kids all around my age who died from cancer.  One of them I knew her son from HS.  Today I went to a market nearby my hometown and the owner got to telling me how his son, Michael, who was raised in that area and now lives in Maine, is S4 colon cancer.  He can no longer take chemo b/c his liver is damaged beyond reparation from previous chemo txs.  I felt so bad talking to him but never mentioned my own situation but alas he saw my port scar.  He could not believe people the age of his son and I are dying of cancer.  It is kind of sad b/c of how many parents are burying their children who are dying from cancer.  These are crazy high cancer numbers for people my age.  In any case, I told him I would put it out there on the thread for people to say some good things and send some good vibes his son\u2019s way so if you ladies would not mind, say a little something kind for Mike in Maine this evening.  Let\u2019s send some good vibes.  He has 3 young kids and he is dying.  It is all so heartbreaking. Rachel: like the nuclear disaster in Japan never happened, several grocery stores in my area are trying to sell us PacRim seafood!  Yeah, like someone waived a magic wand and made all that nuclear waste go away!  More to this point, I am on strictly Canadian tuna these days!!  I traveled to get some this weekend--well, not \"to\" Canada but farther than I normally would for tuna!  Go Canada! I hope you all had the most beautiful Mother\u2019s Day ever!!!!! ",

      "Content": "Apr 14, 2013 08:33AM - edited Apr 14, 2013 08:39AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors!! I hope you all are doing well today! Today my announcement is about cancer care and this is not a news piece but rather a personal story.  When we all came together, most of us were recently diagnosed and were in our original stages of cancer.  Some already had mets and at least one, my beloved Timothea, was already Stage 4.  The purpose of my post today is to encourage all of you to transfer care to one of the top 10, and preferably 5, cancer hospitals in the country if at all possible should you find yourself in the position of suspecting mets and/or recurrence. Of course these are MSK, Dana, MD Anderson, Cleveland and Mayo Minnesota.  I tell you all this because over the past number of months I transferred care to one of the top 5 hospitals and I cannot stress enough how incredible, comprehensive and thorough they are.  Not only do they not miss a trick, they certainly do not ignore what the patients are saying but rather they follow up and follow through. Of course, through this process, they engender such a feeling of confidence.  You kind of feel like if you can beat it, it is going to be there.  I think it is imperative if any of you find yourselves suspecting recurrence and/or mets, to get to one of the top hospitals yesterday.  Clearly there is no cure yet but there are \u201cbetter\u201d hospitals and, to this end, investigate, do your homework and get on those flights, girls!!!  Your lives depend on it!  Also, dont' forget if you find yourself in a tx situation and you have travelled to the hospital, the ACS has \"lodges\" all over the country where you can stay during active txs. To all of you who encouraged me to transfer care to a new hospital, I finally took your advice!!!!  He he he!! Ginger:   I am so happy for you on your mammo results!!!!!   That is wonderful and very, very exciting news!!!!!  I am also glad to hear you took a painting class.  That is a great step in the right direction.  Just don\u2019t be too hard on yourself.  You know so many people think they are so smart about everything, and know the answers to everything, and know how everyone should handle their lives but the fact remains those people are here for our enjoyment so we have someone to laugh at! No one knows what it is like to walk in these cancer shoes until they have.  If you want to sit on the darn couch and watch tv, do that.  Do whatever you feel like doing every day until you feel like doing something else.  Perhaps you are reaching that point in going to talk to someone etc\u2026 but the bottom line is you don\u2019t have to do anything and don\u2019t forget that. You can do whatever the heck you want and don\u2019t mismanage your own emotions b/c societal pressures and know-it-all idiots think you should do something else.  I understand what I am hearing from you is the amorphous nature of your bc existence is a bit unnerving.  Well I don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t question and after all those years you spent yourself up wallowing in perfectly altruistic, and draining (sorry!), work, you don\u2019t have to do anything.  Relax, rest and as for the screaming, you are most likely screaming out at the injustice and no machine is going to find that.  It is very hard to deal with how something like this could happen to you and why.  I feel your screaming is justified but I do feel for your dh!  Sounds like your home might just be large enough for him to choose another bedroom albeit heartbreaking you 2 might sleep in different beds for a while.  Take it easy on yourself. As for the sleep study, I had one as well and yes, 72 things and goop in your hair!!!  What a sight we are after they get us all hooked up!  Also, don\u2019t forget a cancer dx is a deep psychological blow in which you are confronted with your own mortality.  Talking with someone just might help you uncover some of that and maybe the root of your upset in the night will be uncovered through that process.  Hypnosis might not be a bad idea either since whatever is causing it, your non-sleeping self is completely unaware.  Again, take it easy on yourself and just enjoy your painting class now!  You will work through this stuff, Ginger, just go easy. Rachel: you are back!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!  I am so glad to read you slipped some wine in with those dinners!  It is great to see different parts of the world, though.   Even though there are long flights and missing your family, your eyes are treated to marvels your memory will never forget!  That, my friend, is very good stuff!! I was wondering about your MIL also.  Wondering how she is doing. I bet your boys are so excited to have you back home! Connecticut and the Frozen Four!!!  Sptmm and Rachel, I hope you 2 realize that those 2 wonderful teams in the Frozen Four are CT teams!   Yale and Quinnipiac!!  Unbelievable.   Those 2 schools are literally 15 minutes down the road from one another.  Yale is in the bowels of New Haven and although the buildings are beautiful, the adjacent neighborhoods are crime-ridden disasters. On the other hand, Quinnipiac is in a completely bucolic, suburban and very safe area.  They just opened a med school also.  In any case, these are exciting hockey times in our state!! Well, ladies, have a nice weekend and keep smiling as you know what I say----IT WORKS!!!!!!!  It will immediately change your state!!!!!! Happy trails-",

Also in CT we have had meteorites going through the roof in homes from the usually innocuous meteor showers.  I was also hoping that was not anything to do with a meteor shower, still thinking you were showing me a boulder! Finally, on the tuna!!!!!!  You thought I was driving to buy Canadian canned tuna!!!!!!!!  That is hysterical! Very funny! In fact, I laughed out loud when I saw that!

First off, I must wish all you mom\u2019s a Happy Mother\u2019s Day!!!!  It should be Mother\u2019s Week!  My mother loved \u201cTitanic\u201d so I shall play it for her on Sunday!  I miss her.  You never, ever, ever, ever stop missing your mother. Rachel: I did not know that was the nature of the company you worked for.  Now all that travel makes an awful lot of sense.  I will check out that video.  Speaking of the weather, last weekend was ideal in CT but today was just like a perfect summer day = hot, dry and in the 80s!  So nice.  Felisa: did you go to the doctor yet?  I will continue to check on you! Ginger: Good to hear from you!  Montessori is great!  My nephews went.   I bet you are going to absolutely love having your DGD for those 3 hours each day!   Speaking of planting, I just planted mint at my friend\u2019s house!  I am so tired of scrambling for 2nd rate mint for my Dr. Oz drink, I just had to try growing it.  My friend has 10 green thumbs so I suspect vicarious success will soon be mine!  That is great that you are feeling better on Tamoxifen!  Good for you! So apparently Aromasin was playing a large part in your headaches?  My onc spoke to me about extended Tamoxifen a few months ago. I guess prevailing wisdom is changing on the 5 year cut-off and perhaps keeping people on it longer is not such a bad idea.  I won\u2019t mind as it is a non-event for me (hot flashes not withstanding!) and it is a bit of a security blanket!  Seriously, I think I would get really worried to go off of it after the year 5 anniversary. As for Tex, she is doing ok.  She will be moving in June and I am hoping we will hear from her after that move and her computer is replaced.  I was texting her this evening.  I agree on water colors.  After dx and txs, and job loss, I decided to try some crafty stuff.  It is completely not my forte although one great bc painting came of it!  In any case, I did get some water colors at that time and I agree they are definitely pricey.  I like working with water colors.  My new thing is sewing!   I want to pick up a used machine, one of those small ones, and make stuff.  I am tinkering and looking for a hobby for the cold weather months.  Maybe I will like sewing?!   I have not done that since 8th grade! Well, I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and are taking care of yourselves!  Happy trails, girls!",

Rachel: your son must be crazy with anticipation over spending the day with the Maple Leafs!!!  That is so amazing and he must be berserk with joy!!  Speaking of winning, recently I won a $100 AMEX gift card which was stunning b/c I pretty much don\u2019t ever win anything!  In any case, when I went to pick it up the woman there, when I told her it was so anomalous as I never win, sat me down and told me a story about how she has seen things like this in the past and it very well could be an auspicious omen portending of things to come!  Hopefully that applies to you as well, Rachel! If nothing else, she was convincing!  Sort of the Carnegie trick of giving a reputation to live up to!  Yes, I might be a bit more hopeful now! That is a great pic of the wedding!  The one I went to was in NYC and they had the equivalent of mammoth King and Queen-ish chairs!  The wife was like 90 lbs and the husband maybe a buck 10!! They could have each fit about 40 other people in those chairs with them!  It reminded me of \u201cIt\u2019s a Small World\u201d at Disney! Glad you had a good time.  Also great news about your MIL!  You all should have a wonderful day tomorrow and I am glad she is healthy enough to attend your son\u2019s confirmation.  Has anyone seen the commercial with the actor from \u201cBody of Evidence\u201d where she is on a loudspeaker announcing how many cancer patients cannot afford to stay near hospitals where they need to get txs.  What she is asking is for us to text some code so the ACS can get $10.  I am really so disgusted with this.  First off, not a single one of us ever received *anything* in the form of any assistance from the ACS.  They are impervious paper-pushers desirous of simply using these actors as a means to emotionally nickel-and-dime for these nominal, and seemingly innocuous, donations.  It is so abusive.  My poor friend who was being eaten alive by cancer called the ACS numerous times for help and got *nothing.*  The cancer lodges are great, don\u2019t get me wrong, but intimating this $10 donation is going to go directly to cancer patients to offset costs of hotels is disgusting.  Even when I called them about an issue with someone I knew I was summarily told to call 15 other numbers in search of assistance.   I still think Matt Damon has it right with his work with the \u201cFamily Reach Foundation\u201d which gives money for food and utility costs etc.. \u201cdirectly\u201d to the patients.  Groups like the ACS take advantage of actors busy schedules knowing they won\u2019t investigate what is actually going on with their donations. One moron that I know at one point suggested how cancer patients get \u201chooked up\u201d by the ACS with money for mortgage payments, utilities etc\u2026  I looked at her like the idiot that she is and explained she could not be more wrong and that no cancer patients are getting *any* direct monetary assistance from the ACS for their daily living expenses.  She said it like \u201chooked up\u201d meant \u201clucky!!!\u201d   People are sick! Then again I am so ungrateful as I had that wonderful ride-to-recovery with the ACS volunteer who, en route the hospital (where she should have been checked in for psychiatric eval!), reminded me that \u201ccancer is god\u2019s pruning!!!\u201d  I just agreed with her!!  Thanks, ACS!!!!!

Still freezing here..!  Tale of 2 friends: one is on the Cape, wearing a parka and another is in Myrtle Beach sunning it up!!!!! What wild weather! Tex: I am so sorry to hear about the woman that died in the flash flood.  That is horrible.  I just think it all  happens so fast, our reactions are not trained for such events.  They say the reason so many die in plane crashes is instead of quickly moving through emergency measures, our minds go in a constant loop searching for point of reference.  Of course most people don\u2019t have one and they freeze.  Even when we were young and traveling around the northeast, my mother would always remind me to crack the window just in case.  Bottom line, though, is it all can just happen so fast, people can\u2019t react.   What a terrible loss.    As for the ACS, my friend died, having lost her kids to DCF, meanwhile trying desperately to get support from ACS etc..   In fact, I think that struggle led to her spiraling downward.  She was predeceased by her dh (car accident) and so the story was so much more sad w/the kids.  I completely lost all faith and respect for that cash cow, the American Cancer Society.  In my opinion I think they are very much a smoke-in-mirrors operation.  I understand why people give as they feel better after they have done *something* and the ACS knows that; they play on that.  I am just glad Matt Damon, Ming Tsai, Mario Batali, Marc Forgione, Masaharu Morimoto et al started a foundation that works directly with, and gives money directly to, people fighting cancer.  That makes me very happy as cancer and the txs are stressful enough without having to totally sweat the daily living expenses combined with your newfound outrageous cancer expenses. That is so nice about your stepdad giving you a bike just for no reason!  What a nice guy!  My dad was a really good guy.  Unfortunately cancer claimed him at 56 years old.  I know you losing your stepdad during your protracted cancer battle was very hard.  Same with me and my mom.  You know, in some way you think those battling cancer would be spared from such catastrophic loss and heartbreak but that is just not the case. I hope you are having a nice time packing and getting ready for your move!  Packing is cathartic in that it gives you the opportunity to get rid of a bunch of crap!  I am just so happy for you and glad you are moving into your own home and those kids can have fun out in their own backyard and that everything has fallen into place for you.  This makes me very happ ;) I agree totally about our friendships borne on this thread of our mutual struggle = good stuff, indeed! Hope you guys are having a nice weekend-",

I think it was just outside of Seattle and now I am worried as we have not heard from you.  You are most likely doing something fabulous but I would be happy to hear from you just the same!

Truly is it a milestone especially b/c we battle this baffling disease. I have been busier as of late. I do have a biopsy coming up in in a few weeks.  In the words of the very entertaining radiologist, \"I don't know what the heck that is!!!!\"  I was even looking on the screen and wondering myself just what \"it\" is.  It has gotten larger and changed shape since the last ultrasound so it is time to draw some cells out!  Effin' cancer!

Happy belated birthday to the US and Canada!!!!!!  Hope everyone is having a nice summer!!  Things have definitely gotten busier for me!  Iowa: love that dog!!!!!!!!  So cute!!!!!!!!   It is pretty good that you got some bikes out  there, though.  It is never as many as we would like but it works nonetheless!  I did a fundraiser for a woman who has bc and her dd has cancer also.  I spent January and February accumulating all sorts of stuff that was donated and getting it all together, journaled in etc\u2026 and after all that work, we made just over $8000 but honestly, I wish it was more.  That was a lot of work but it was like an extended Christmas when all those packages were showing up in Jan and Feb, though!  I liked that part.  Bottom line is you with the biking event and me with my involvement with the silent auction, our hearts are in the right place!!! Glad you are having good times for yourself there, woman! Felisa: good to hear from you!  Hope you are having a good summer as I told you would be your post-chemo and rads gift ;) Rachel:  I love the DR!!!  I have been twice.  It is a fun and easy trip from the Northeast.  With this heat we have now, I only want to go north!   A friend just bought a house way upstate NY and actually his aunt\u2019s farm is on the St. Lawrence.  In any case, will be going to see him in September with another stop in Cooperstown---Baseball Hall of Fame!!! Sorry to hear about your MIL.  Recently I was at Dana Farber and there was a line of us waiting to pay for parking.  Out of nowhere I suddenly just said \u201ccrap ass cancer\u201d and everyone started to laugh!  It is kind of quiet where we go to pay for the parking ticket and I have no clue why I spoke my thought but I did!  About Dana, though, it is a great hospital.  Even the parking garage is wicked clean!  Speaking of the parking garage, a friend was over not too long ago and she said she saw a ghost in this house as we were sitting in the dining room. My friend is terribly religious and does not subscribe to \u201cghost\u201d sighting notions so it was odd and it kind of shook her a bit.  I figured it was my mother or the woman who used to live here who also died of cancer.  In fact, when I was first moving in it was late one night and I was just checking around and dropping off a few things and out of nowhere, crystal clear I heard \u201cexcuse me\u201d from the mouth of a woman that was absolutely appalled I was in her house!!!  I don\u2019t hear ghosts etc\u2026 but that was one freaky situation and as this is a quiet neighborhood and it was quiet in this house, I knew what I heard!  I explained she would have to accept that she had died and that I preferred she not talk to me anymore!! In any case you are probably wondering \u2018where is Lizzy going with all of this?!\u2019  I saw a ghost in the Dana Farber garage!   I know it sounds crazy but I did!  Then again perhaps it is the heat!!!!!!   Back to your MIL, I am glad the family is having an appointment with the onc.  She needs you all to be there for her.  I look at the kids and all of use at DF and my heart breaks.  About a month ago I was there and it was pouring out.  There was a mother and father putting a little yellow slicker on their daughter and she was only about 6 or 7.  She had that little bald head and I was parked, waiting at the light, watching them get her ready to walk out to the cab. I started crying and thankfully b/c of the rain, they could not see me.  One thing about Dana is we see the kids.  I see them in general areas like the parking/valet payment area, patient relations, the lobbies etc\u2026  and it breaks my heart.  At Yale we never really saw the kids as they have their own wing but at Dana I am glad I see the kids, even though it is also sad, and I hope that we, the adults, give them hope even in a small way.  You just want to hug them and take it all away from them though.  It is tough and I have to fight to make sure I don\u2019t tear up when I see them.  It is not easy.  So, in long my point is: CRAP ASS CANCER and I wish you all the best with your MIL. How are the boys?  Did you skip Punta Cana for the DR?  Did they like vacation?  Best of luck with your mammo and appointment.  May you get the \u201call clear!\u201d Omaz: I saw some wild pics of a hail storm in AZ from July 3!  It really looked like snow had accumulated.  Perhaps you don\u2019t even know what I am talking about!!!   I am sitting here watching the Yankees and have no idea how they are playing this game in 100+ heat and w/the humidity it feels like 115+.   I know this sounds so idyllic but I seriously like it about 88 and dry during the day and 65-68 at night, dry and cool!  In CT we are lucky we get 2 days like that each summer!  However, *anything* is better than that blizzard!!!!!!  Ah, the joys of 4 seasons! I hope everyone is doing well!  We are coming up on our 3 year for this thread = amazing!  We are all still here-YAY!! Happy trails, ladies-",

ONE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT in the detection of breast cancer that is currently being worked on (taken from http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/womenshealth/breastcancernews.htm):  A number of research centres around the world are looking into the possibility of developing a reliable blood test for breast cancer. In the UK trials are underway on a test developed at Nottingham University that could detect breast cancer up to four years earlier than a mammogram. The test detects subtle changes in proteins in the blood that happen when the immune system begins to fight cancer. It's hoped that it will lead to cancers being picked up much earlier, making treatment options more effective. Well, glad someone is working on this one!  No more pancakes!  Actually, it seems incomprehensible this has not been established yet.  Alas, there is hope! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< Iowa: keep riding, sister!  Hope you have a wonderful time at Sturgis, checking off items on that bucket list!  Happy trails, girls!",

I cannot believe how bc is moving towards epidemic-status; it seems almost weekly I am learning of someone else who has been dxd. Here\u2019s to life-saving treatments!!! I am going to do a bc walk this month and I was invited to a ground-breaking of pink hard hats for a new cancer research facility in New Haven. Anyone doing anything this month for our \u201cawareness\u201d month?! It seems the further from dx I get, the more invites I am getting to cancer events. Dana Farber is having a day long cancer event with several speakers and activities planned. I cannot wait to go to that. I will be making notes and sharing my findings with all of my Warriors here! Lady: I think about you often! I was wondering how Chicago went and am so glad you had a great experience! That is great and I am very happy for you ;) Great for you on the executive director of the local OC support group! That is wonderful and I am glad to hear they have such a lovely leader to look to! What\u2019s more is that, and we have spoken about this here on the thread, other cancers don\u2019t have the kind of support and organization as bc does so I think it is great you are reenergizing that group. Cancer is just awful and everyone who has it needs some kind of support; glad you are doing your part, Lady! Speaking of working out, I am planning to start water spinning! I cannot wait! In November I am going to my first class!!! Keep with the Nautilus stuff. When I was 20 years old and started body building, I bought a ton of books. Recently I was going through those books and found that roughly 40% of them are Nautilus books. You are absolutely correct in that even if it does not help w/weight, you are *stronger* and feeling better so just keep going and completely disconnect from the results-driven lunacy that is so pervasive in our fitness centers. Just keep going! Plantar is painful and I have had issues with it here and there. Most unfortunately right now I am dealing with an Achilles flare-up which is just a total freakin\u2019 drag. I did not need this right now but alas I will work through the pain and deal with the fallout later! Yes, live cheaply and simply. That is the best way b/c the more you engage in the rat race, the more your life becomes about money and who\u2019s pile is bigger, the less you can be counted on to act like a civilized human being and the more your open up your life to trouble, as a result of your rat-race winning actions, and sickness ensues. It is not worth it. Relax- I think the monks have it right! Good to hear from you! Ginger: I knew it! I knew something (but I did not know many things) had happened! I was getting so nervous and jumping to conclusions! I am so glad to hear from you. Good news about your knees not hurting but requiring less follicles to do so is not so good news! I cannot believe you had a car crash and of all the things, w/little Zoe with you. I am so sorry to hear. 45 MPH is pretty fast and I am sure you will never forget that sound. I am so glad to hear she is ok. How horrifying and to be pushed down into a ditch, that is just awful. Highlanders are great, however, and I don\u2019t blame you for lamenting the loss of your vehicle. My friend\u2019s parents are convinced the Highlander saved their lives when they were in a pretty bad accident in Wyoming. In any case, I am just glad neither of you were badly hurt. As for the node on your thyroid, let\u2019s hope it is benign. I will be sending wishes your way. It is good that the scan revealed this. I was just wondering the other night how the heck will they ever find mets w/us before we expire of such?! Seriously, breasts are the obvious stomping grounds and our mammos showcased our bc but what about when it is setting up camp elsewhere? I seriously wonder how they catch it before we are at critical mass. It seems the discovery process, post initial dx, is amorphous really. So, yes, it is really important to keep your doc appts and get checked out, head-to-toe. Cancer is a sneaky disease and we must be vigilant! You know, being a passenger in a car is scary enough and add to that the fact you were just broadsided\u2026it could be a while before you are comfortable as a passenger again. The story about being pulled by the dogs, finding yourself on the ground and then them barking b/c of suspected \u201cbush\u201d activity is just scary. I must tell you, when I lived in NY I was nearly hyper-aware. My roommate and I lived in the W80s, in a brownstone, and one night a woman who lived in our building was raped in the hallway, no more than 20 feet from our door and we did not hear a thing b/c our crazy asses would have been out in that hallway whipping some attacker ass! In any case, we both got guns after that and this is the way you live in the city. That and a very handsome friend of our\u2019s, who was doing a lot of Broadway, had his face slashed open, for no good reason, leaving the Subway in E70s after 10 one night. We all knew better than to ride the subways after 7 and all the firms on Wall St gave every employee, working after 7, car service home or to GCT etc.. It is a personal safety issue. In any case, what I wish to impart was during this time I learned about \u201ccity bars.\u201d They help to thwart intruders trying to gain door and/or window access. When I left NY I pretty much left that behind UNTIL cancer. Living alone, and being the last house on a dead end, I realized that cancer, all 13 surgeries, chemo etc\u2026 had just taken me down to the point where I did not feel I could adequately defend myself in the event of an intrusion, even with protection devices. I live in a city where the crime rate, unfortunately, is higher than I would like. In any case, I started city bars again during the cancer battle and b/c your dh travels so much, you should think about some security measures like \u201cLife Alert\u201d and even a taser gun. I know you are most likely opposed to guns, even for home security, so I would not even suggest that but it would not be a bad idea to consider a taser. It is a humane way to deal even with bears or other large mammals that roam your area. Here in CT a woman was just badly hurt by a bear who bit her in the leg b/c it was trying to eat her dog. I don\u2019t know about the efficacy of a taser against a bear but I know you can buy law enforcement caliber tasers for about $1000 online. You would have to check with your local laws etc\u2026 but it might not be a bad idea, Ginger. A friend on the Cape has a friend that went hiking. She is in her 60s and very active. Unfortunately she sprained her ankle and hurt some other leg muscles on her hike and ended up lying in the woods for nearly 7 hours before someone found her. Why? Because she was hiking w/her a phone where the battery had died. This is not to say living in fear is a good idea but if you make sure you don\u2019t go out to walk the dogs w/out a fully charged phone and consider what you might do if you encountered a bear, or a wayward human for that matter, while out in the wee hours, and have a plan. Simple steps like Life Alert and a taser are rather innocuous personal safety measures and if people who are afflicted with debilitating disease, at any age, are using the likes of Life Alert, it is no longer a device for people who are in their 90s! These are just a few steps you might want to consider b/c your dh travels a lot. I say better to be prepared especially b/c you are in a somewhat remote setting. I care about you so this all comes from the heart and is not meant to exacerbate any feelings relating to the accident or the dogs pulling you around in the wee hours but rather just give you some things to think about. Finally, ladies, in talking about personal security, DO NOT put your vacation plans on FB, Twitter (if you use a personal handle), Four Square, Linked In etc\u2026 ! Don\u2019t throw your vaca pics on Instagram while you are STILL ON VACA! My friend in NY came home to an empty house b/c he thought it was smart to throw all his pics from Turks all over Instagram, Twitter, FB etc\u2026 It is just something to remember. Ok, now I have talked your ears off!!!!!!! Happy trails, girls, and have a good weekend!",

I will provide the link here shortly. This is directly connected to our own bc battle and a way in which we can directly try to influence the outcomes for women struggling, as Tex did, to get attention at a very young age, as current mammo guidelines preclude mostly everyone under 40. Recently I took a head-clearing trip through the Adirondacks! It is amazing to see hundreds of thousands of acres untouched by humanity especially in the very congested Northeast. It has been years since I was through there and decided to go en route seeing a friend who lives on the St. Lawrence across from \u201cOh Canada!\u201d As I was meandering along wondering what Lewis and Clark were thinking when confronted with the Rocky Mountains, which the very breadth of dwarfs the Adirondacks, I wondered how our land is so poisoned with carcinogenics. It is hard to fathom when in such a space unspoiled by our modern lifestyle. Reason for sharing: on my travels I encountered the little-known NY Amish! Of course, I am sure TLC has some trucks heading north now in search of more people whose lives they can ruin through exploitation! In any case, no surprise research revealed they have very low cancer rates. Alas our modern lives are taking us down! Tex: That 40-64 mammo business is laughable! A woman said to me the other night I was far too young to have bc. She said I look easily 10 years younger than I am. People do say this about me but that observation aside, I reminded her almost all the women in this group were late 30s/early 40s and when I ever told her about you, she was stunned. On the lady lumps, no, I don\u2019t think that is what the \u201cBlack Eyed Peas\u201dmeant! Jokers, Timothea, they are all jokers! Speaking of tattoos, did you hear Google has created a \u201cNECK\u201d tattoo?! They are becoming more and more scary, and diabolical, by the day in their attempt to track the eff out of us! I cannot believe this. It connects to your phone somehow\u2026omg\u2026talk about cancer\u2026Google has gone mad. I think the govt needs to shut their campus down for no less than 1 year! I think they are out-of-control. You know who will get these neck tattoos, don\u2019t you? Young, naive kids who have no clue something so profoundly invasive is tantamount to developing a host of things, not the least of which is cancer. Google needs to be examined by the government. They are going crazy with their tracking lunacy! Timothea, you make a good point about carrying an advance directive. That is smart. I have gotten to the point where I have a separate travel bag w/my medical record that I take w/me when I am going on trips. Surely a rose would not hurt once in a while! Tell him\u2026you know guys have to be trained!!! I hope everyone has a healthy and happy holiday! I also want everyone to get ready to celebrate 5 years as we are closer to 5 than not!!!!!!!! Good times, ladies! Wow....what a long, strange trip it has been!!!!!!!!",

Another year is coming to a close!!!  I want to wish everyone a very happy New Year and a safe NYE!  I am not a proponent of drinking and driving but Connecticut lowered the BAL to such a very low level, 2 beers might put you in jeopardy of being arrested for DUI!  It will be a taxi evening! Last night, while waiting online in CVS, I met the most delightful young man!  He told me he and his boyfriend were making plans for NYE and a little about what they were doing etc....  All I could think was not only how beautiful he was but his eyebrows, which were penciled on, looked absolutely *perfect* and fantastic!  He could make a lot of us bc girls pretty happy when we are going through dreadful chemo!  I did not remark on his brows, of course, but I did secretly wonder if he was a make-up artist as they were just wonderful! Tex:  how did your dh interview go?  I hope he had a good one!   Let us know and hope you are doing well this evening. Sptmm: I am working on an anniversary plan for us!  I am thinking somewhere warm.  I will be sure to let you know immediately!   Felisa:  I am sorry to hear you are having complications that require long-term pain management.  If there is no infection any longer though,why won't they proceed with removal now?  I know removal is awful but at the same time, it seems as if it is necessary.   How are they so sure you will get another infection?  Wasn't the last one b/c fluid was pooling in the remaining breast tissue?  I would think removal would stop that from happening, no?  Most of this stuff has to do with a compromised lymphatic system after removal of nodes.  I hope they clear you for surgery as that will most likely eradicate all pain eventually. In any case, the arrival of your grandson will help you forget all of this madness!!!   I hope you feel better soon.  Keep us posted and keep your chin up :) I subscribe to the \"Reconstruction Network\" emails.  I get some interesting stuff and what I want to share with you all, that was part of an email I received from Reconstruction Network, is a little twist on the usual NY resolutions.  Most of us try to make drastic changes and then lament making such far-reaching goals when we invariably fall short. Some NY Resolutions you can embrace...and keep: 1- Eat 1 piece of dark chocolate every day ----we all can do this one, no problem! 2- Give and receive 1 hug and 1 kiss every day. 3- Read 1 book for fun every month. 4- Enjoy yourself on weekends without worrying about work. 5- Buy at least one bottle of good wine you'll enjoy (without worrying about the price tag). --this one could be very, very costly!!!!!!! 6- Tell one person you love him or her every day. 7- Go outside and play at least once a week. 8- Have a spa massage. 9- Buy yourself flowers for NO REASON! 10- Take up a new hobby.  There's something you've always wanted to try. --I personally am doing this one....I am going to start sewing!   A very good friend, in response to my complaints about lack of a good tailor and how life outside of NYC is bleak (!), gave me a sewing machine for Christmas!!  I have not sewn anything in over 30 years so this should be fun!!   There were 25 in total but I thought you could all pick one or two from this list!!!  I like it as it is a new twist on resolutions.  Resolve to do other, easier, and more fun things and we will never be setting ourselves up for failure!  I am convinced we can all keep a few of these resolutions!  Resolve to be better to yourself.  That is probably the best one ;) Finally, I am going to refer to lyrics of one of Sir Elton John's songs that can pretty much sum up the way we all should feel as we move on down this bc path: I AM STILL STANDING!!!!!  I know it was the 80s and although I love almost everything he ever did, this was always one of my fav songs! HAPPY NEW YEAR, LADIES!!!!!!!!!  I hope you all have a safe and lovely evening.  Enjoy!  ",

That is great that you are sleeping when tired and waking and eating whenever you feel like it.  Exactly what you should be doing...listen to your body especially now in going through rads.  That is good that there is a cancer bus.  I just think it is way easier for you to be picked up and dropped off whenever possible. Your dog knows you love him/her!   You have a lot going on, it is hard to keep track of everything. Deb: now I have to say, Timothea is down in TX, which is basically like a foreign country where the propaganda machine is in full-effect so I definitely give her a pass on *not* knowing about that whacky Toronto mayor but you are just across the LI Sound from me!?!??!  How could you not know?!  Jimmy Fallon, JKL, Letterman...all the great comedians have been having a blast with this!  Bing him...you will be stunned by what you find!   Deb, I was thinking of you this morning because I was considering putting out on the thread that we all try to lose 20.14 lbs n 2014 as the whole of humanity is wanting to be in better shape and we are no different here.  In any case, I realized that might place your very thin self in a perilous situation, so I lol'd when I decided it would be appropriate to reduce your goal to 20.14 ounces!!!!!!!!!!!   I am sure others here cannot lose 20 lbs and not be under weight but I thought of you immediately b/c of your commitment and subsequent weight loss!  Congratulations, btw, in maintaining your loss!  That is the even harder part. As for the cold, I kind of like it esp w/these hot flashes.  Sorry to say, I actually went outside the other night, it is so hot in here!  As for scarves and hats, I am slow to get going with this knitting so I decided to join a group called \"Stitch and Bitch!\"  Yes, we all get together, create things and complain!  There is another where we drink wine...any guess as to which one I like better?!  Yes, wine...! Sweeney: we all struggle with the eat less/right part!  That is a perfectly ubiquitous problem affecting the planet at large! No pun!!  I am glad you and Sptmm enjoy my Wall St stories!  There are days when I can't even believe it...my rear view is like a movie! Ladyinbama: yes, we are all freezing!  BTW, I sent all the vibes I could to your Tigers!!!  I hope they won.  I did not check scores yet but I am looking forward to hearing some good news! SO, does anyone want to try the lose 20.14lbs in 2014?  Might be fun and it is a fairly achievable goal for those of us that have 20 to lose (Sptmm excluded)!!!  Tex: best of luck at rads, girl!  Do you go every day?  I don't seem to know that answer and I apologize if you shared that here already.  For how long will you be doing rads?  I wish you the best.   Hang in there, things are bound to get better ;) Happy trails, ladies!  ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!",

      "Content": "Jan 11, 2014 06:11AM 1WonderWoman wrote: Good day, Warriors!!!!! I wanted to be clear on something: when I stated in my response to Tex and about her almost being in the position of having to \"defend\" the fact she remains in a protracted cancer battle to the Facebook folk, what I meant by \"once you have cancer, you always have cancer\" was not negative or ominous, but rather just the way I see things.  Add to that the fact I find it incomprehensible that she might have to chronologically defend herself to judgmental idiots about her S4 bc battle to be just insulting.  A lot of people have preconceived notions because they like completion and to see things through to their end so they can call them done.  We all know that the only day we can truly call cancer done is the day we leave this hemisphere.  The \"done\" and \"remission\" business is really semantics, imo.  However, the treatments are getting much, much better, they are learning more every day and the fact remains we are all still here.  This is indicative of a very positive and overarching trend, and with bc in particular.  I always tell people even though my cancer got into my lymph nodes, I am very happy my cancer was in an \"expendable\" appendage!  I know I have mentioned that here before and like I said, if my father could have removed his lungs and survived, of course he would have.  I just think the world needs to stop struggling to apply labels and thereby try to gauge progress of people with cancer.  Quite philosophically, and to borrow that grossly overused phrase, \"it is what it is.\" A few days ago a woman I know was asking about where it all was for me.  I explained that cancer does not readily announce itself and, quite frankly, I have no clue what it is doing.  I told her I am here today and that is all I know!!!!!!  This is all any of us know.   We celebrate life every day and we live and struggle through our txs and through our appts and the nauseating feeling most of us get when returning for the annual check-ups and this is our now not-so-new reality.  We deal....everyone needs to as well!!!!!!! Tex: I am so glad your first week is O-V-E-R!!!   That is wonderful news!   Rest, relax, play with the kids, laugh with them, eat what you want, drink lots of fluids and try to enjoy yourself as much as possible through this.  When you are not feeling so good, just head back to YouTube and watch some more Rob Ford clips!!!!!  That will give you some laughs to keep you going!  There is also endless supply of funny stuff on Netflix!  Keep laughing and relaxing, that is all you can do.  Be good to yourself, that is the most important thing.  Surround yourself with love and positivity and remove all else.  You don't need any other thing in your life right now.  Just you and your adorable little kids, relaxation and good times!  That is all you need....and the love of your dog!  Pets are great! Something else that I find very entertaining and funny is the \"Steve Harvey\" show!  I love it!  I think he is such a doll, such a kind hearted human being and he has always done so much good.  Plus he is just funny and I think the eclectic nature of his show is wonderful!  You should watch! So it looks like Tex, Oh Canada (I have combined Rachel and Sweeney under this moniker!!!) and me are going to make a goal of losing 20.14 in 2014!!!! YAY!  I know my smart pals here already know what the 2015 goal will be! My feeling is we will put on 10 at the holidays so every year we will have 10 in the holiday bank in case we really want to go crazy!   I know Sptmm will join us with her 20.14 oz goal!!!!!!!!   The countdown to my big check-up at Dana is upon me and I can't say I am not nervous.  I am nervous b/c this is the big one with tests and blah blah.  Oh well...it must be done!   Crap ass cancer..! Have a lovely weekend, ladies, and get all the rest you can, Timothea!",

Tex: I wish you the very, very best this week in rads!I hope it all goes ok and you tolerate those awful steroids as well as possible. I feel for you, kid, I really do. Deb(Sptmm) makes a really good point about reading to the kids so you can all relax together. Also coloring with them or maybe even a board game in bed? Anything you can do to keep them calm, be there for them and also be able to rest a little. Making flash cards for their studies is also a good exercise that you can all do sitting down and it helps them to learn. I wish you the best, think of you every single day and send you positive vibes all the time. Sometimes I wish I could be in Texas, therewith you to help you through. Your dh and the kids are a great support system, though, and for this reason I rest knowing that you are surrounded by love and caring. Take it easy this week and be good to yourself. I agree with Deb in that you do so much with the kids while at the same time dealing with all these cancer issues, it is amazing.Surely accolades don\u2019t take away the struggles you must have at times to keep it all going but I sure hope it helps sometimes to remember how much so many people think of you ;) My best friend since like 4th grade started a paper route at the age of about 11 also. Her mother was a single parent so she spent a lot of time at my house and my father was kind of like a surrogate dad to her. She did not have a car or a bike and would get up at 4, just like you in all different CT weather, and head out to deliver and I would go collecting with her sometimes with those little white tickets! It was a hard job for a young person but she was independent even way back then.Asfor hardship and families, I went out with a guy from a very, very wealthy Greenwich family once and I remember him saying that every family has all the same dysfunctional crap going on but b/c his family had substantial wealth, everyone thought they had no problems. Boy, did they ever have problems! In any case, most of us are not much different than others. No, none ofus believe our parents ever made all the right decisions by us, loved us and expressed it the way we wanted them to, had all the money to give us all the stuff we wanted, had tons of concern for us at all times etc\u2026. Bottom line human beings are flawed and as much as our parents did not do everything right, they only did what they knew and you have to look to their upbringing to try to establish a philosophical basis for helping yourself better understand their short comings. It is very difficult and clearly your mother, in wanting you to get married, saw a world in which a woman could only survive if she had a man to care for her. You can look to her mother for why she thought that. My very good friend from college was Haitian. Kelly took me home to meet her mom 1weekend. Her mother was perversely diabolical, repeatedly hammering Kelly about her frivolous college pursuits and that she better just get out there and find herself a man!!!!!We laughed so hard, I nearly soiled myself! All weekend she said our laughing was ridiculous! She mimicked us and lamented our silly nature! Seriously, Kelly had so much fun teasing her mother all weekend about how she would never marry and how she was not going to have some man telling her what to do. Last I knew Kelly did not marry and she is a doctor now. Bottom line, all our parents did was try to neatly package up their neurosis and deliver them to us in a palatable manner! Every family you walk by every day and every person you pass has come from, in one way or another, what they perceived to be parents with dreadful shortcomings and yet we all carryon! Some clearly have worse experiences than others but overall, we all have issues with our parents and guess what? They had issues with their parents! It is as old as the dirt we walk on. Just remember that on some level, they really meant well. They thought, however misguided, what they were doing for you was correct, as harsh as it may now seem. If they thought life was very hard, they would try to prepare you for what they thought was going to be an inevitable of a life of hardship. They wanted you to know that life is very hard and so by doing some things you now resent, all they were doing was trying to get you prepared to have their experience in life. You know what? Life is not hard and life can be wonderful; alas it is 1 part education and 1 part what you make of it. Feel pity for the fact they could not see that life could be beautiful and wonderful and instead tried to get you ready for hardship. They were wrong and you have a loving family and are a loving and caring mom. You choose to pour a healthy love all over your children\u2026a healthy love and you know it is healthy b/c, and sadly, you know what unhealthy love was. It is all love, though, just comes indifferent and sometimes misguided packages. Remember the misguided part and this just might help you, a wee bit, to understand and maybe come to peace with it yourself. You are all that matters now; you and the peace you can make with all that has gone before. As for those in-laws, I cannot believe what you have to go through. It took her 9 hours to get there with a comb?!Not only that but constantly trying to have to defend your position, it is just maddening. I promise you, I wish so much I had my mom around, and in better condition than she was, during my bc battle and I wish my dad was alive but as for other family and people, I did not want a lot around because they get stupid with their questions and talk of \u201cgone\u201d and \u201ccured\u201d and then I would get pissed off and let it rip!!!!!Then I would find myself upset, then feeling badly, then calm again and the whole cycle could start again at any minute so, and for just these reasons, keep your business to yourself as that whole lot of people sounds completely draining and you need your energy not to fight off feelings of being hurt by the nutty people, their stupid questions and lack of concern and to focus on your kids, keeping yourself happy and unencumbered by the ill-effects of others! As my friend Mary says \u201cI only think about what makes me happy!\u201d Try it, it works!  You just have to give up on having any expectations of these people every caring enough to provide you with what you need emotionally during your battle.  You hope beyond hope that they will be decent and supportive and then they are a let-down so that means they sap your energy and so before allowing yourself to be disappointed by looking for love in all the wrong places, reminder yourself it is ok to disengage.  Just disengage. Sptmm: 3 years ago I made a reminder in my phone that goes off every day and it says: Cancer loves sugar, cancer loves soy and cancer loves it when you don\u2019t exercise. Those are the facts. You are absolutely correct and that information you read is absolutely true in that cancer loves sugar. It is the gas for the cancer truck. Every white flour product is sugar; mostly all pastas and rice are sugar\u2026we are literally surrounded by it. All I drink is water also. I mean I do have coffee, wine and beer on occasion but by and large, all I drink every day is water. I was so enthralled to get the Cuisinart version of \u201cSoda Stream\u201d for Xmas! Now I can use my fresh fruit and toss it in my seltzer and ain\u2019t life grand?!?!? Deb, I so wish you were with me tonight. I was at an event and we were talking in a group and this one woman says \u201cso is you cancer gone?\u201d My seltzer almost came out my nose! I mean seriously? Did you just say that? I tried to calmly explain cancer is *never*gone and until there is a cure, no, my cancer has not been \u201ccured!\u201d I asked a friend later if I was diplomatic enough in my delivery and she said people just ask those questions because they are hopeful cancer can actually be \u201cgone.\u201d I told her as much as I would like to emotionally manage everybody else that I, and most people w/cancer, find \u201cgone\u201d and \u201ccured\u201d questions to engender our own false hope about this never-gone disease.  Now I guess I have to be sensitive to those without cancer and give them hope that even if their non-cancer state becomes a cancerous one, that they can look forward to using the word \u201cgone\u201d regarding their relationship with this lifelong disease!I don\u2019t think it is ever gone but I do think, if you try to do the right stuff (whatever that means to you and your situation), you might be able to keep it at bay. That is all I think of cancer but I don\u2019t ever make the mistake of verbally reducing this monster to a banished state of \u201cgone.\u201d That is too cavalier for me. Ginger: it is impossible to stay cool especially when they are, for whatever reason, dissatisfied with what they are seeing and wanting \u201cmore\u201d films!!!That is not an issue of not being able to \u201cstaying cool\u201d but rather just being human! My heart sank when at Dana this summer they kept wanting to take more on a scan of some sort (I even forget what it was!)b/c it is scary.It is just plain scary. I take 1 of the smallest does of Xanax with me and will take ½ if I feel I am getting anxious. You might want to figure out what your Xanax is and don\u2019t travel w/out it when going for check-ups! It looks like our \u201ccheck-up\u201d cycle is now in sync as I go next week also\u2026stomping and screaming but I will go! Guys, did you ever just not want to go for check-ups anymore? I seriously am just thinking ignorance is bliss. I feel sometimes if I don\u2019t go for check-upsI will never know and maybe I can just cruise into law school and get through and just not deal with cancer anymore. Then I wake up! I always think they are missing things, that they will never find mets with their hands-off ridiculous bloodwork and boy won't I be nearly dead by the time cancer very noticeably announces itself again!!!  And here we all are!!!!! Happy trails, ladies and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!!!!!!",

      "Content": "Feb 5, 2014 04:56PM 1WonderWoman wrote: Good evening, Warriors! Yesterday, as it is now 12:35 in the Northeast, was \u201cWorld Cancer Day.\u201d I was busy today, trying to get things done in between snow storms. In any case, I wanted to post yesterday, on World Cancer Day but the message is the same.  As Rachel pointed out in her last post, cancer really does suck. The numbers are staggering.  I heard so many statistics today, it was unreal.  Between NPR and CNN and the newspapers and CNBC, the talk was all about cancer and how it will fast reach pandemic status in the next 20 years.  They said 1 in 3women will be dxd and 1 in 2 men in the next *10* years.  That was one staggering prediction/fact I could not forget. This was taken from CNN and I just cannot believe what I read: CNN --Cancer cases are expected to surge 57% worldwide in the next 20 years, an imminent \"human disaster\" that will require a renewed focus on prevention to combat, according to the World Health Organization. The World Cancer Report, produced by the WHO's specialized cancer agency and released on World Cancer Day, predicts new cancer cases will rise from an estimated 14 million annually in2012 to 22 million within two decades. Over the same period, cancer deaths are predicted to rise from 8.2 million a year to 13 million. The rising incidence of cancer, brought about chiefly by growing, aging populations worldwide, will require a heavier focus on preventive public health policies, said Christopher Wild, director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  If you want to read more, here is the link: <http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/04/health/who-world-cancer-report>  I know the more subjects that fall into the system, the more subjects they will have to work with, to make txs better, to make dxs better and hopefully to move toward a point where cancer is not quite so lethal.  Rachel: if you could let your MIL know that someone in CT thanks her for all that she is doing, quite selflessly, to help others battling this disease.  It is so very altruistic of her to go through the study knowing full well it is not having any impact in her status.  It is heartbreaking but at the same time they learn so much.  I just really, really appreciate what she has done for all of us.  I would do the same.  I would definitely do whatever I could to help others in this battle even if I knew my own days were very much numbered.  If I could help extend the lives of others or help \u201cthem\u201d learn more about cancer, it would be worth it.  A lot of people are selfish, though, and right until the end.  More to this point, her efforts and participation are valiant and definitely not in vain.  I think it is an awful lot for you to deal with and as much as we all love so deeply is as much as we hurt.  I hope you and your dh have date night and that you are trying, even with all of this going on, to take some time for yourself and reflect.  I hope you are doing ok with all of this.  Now onto lighter fare!!!!  Your Toronto Mayor did not disappoint this past weekend and you are probably aware the US has started a petition to deport Justin Bieber!!!!!!I guess there are enough signatures and the State Department is going to look at it! It is all so silly alas it provides much needed breaks from all the more serious stuff.  Tex: hope all is well\u2026you have been a little too quiet there, girlie!  Can you let us all know how you are?  Well, I do love living with all 4 seasons and I have always liked winter but this one in particular I have loved!  It has been so gorgeous, looking at all the trees covered in snow and finally being able to do some cross country skiing, it has been grand! It is just really beautiful and I love the cold, I love it!  I can also thank this weather for helping me put off my Dana appointments for a few more weeks!  I am really dreading going because I just don\u2019t feel so good these days but we shall see.I am really dreading it.  Finally, it is so very paradoxical someone as enormously talented as Philip Seymour Hoffman spent time anesthetizing himself, trying to slowly snuff out a glorious life and here we are, fighting for our lives every day.  I wonder what makes this happen.  He was a brilliant actor.  Happy trails ladies! ",

As for the sleeping, so many people are getting the flu, to 1 degree or another, and that kind of sleep seriously sounds like you might be coming down with the flu.  There is also the idea that you might have been exposed to it when you went into the medical buildings for your tests etc... last week and your body is trying to fight it off.  As I type I am secretly hoping you don't have it and that the sleep was the beginning for you.  My friend just had it and he said he slept for like 14 hours or something like that.   I hope it is not the flu and it might just be nothing at all.  Maybe your body just needed the rest?  Honestly, though, now that I reread your post, I realize that the cold sweat and feverish business....I think you have the flu, Barb.  I am so sorry for you.  It is just everywhere.  I am lifting, doing 45 minutes of cardio daily and eating copious amounts of fruits and vegetables all in an attempt to keep my immune system strong and avoid that darn flu. I hope you are ok.  Please keep us posted on the results.  My GP uses a system to deliver messages to me with the results of any tests.  He is only the hardest working doctor I have ever met, he is wonderful and he also will leave me messages on Saturday and/or Sunday if the situation calls for it.  I think all doctors, especially our oncs etc..., should be using this system instead of leaving us hanging.  Alas I guess nothing is perfect!

It is a shame that the old nurse is gone.  For this reason, because the nurse is new, I would hope this is just related to the accident.  She does sound very, very new.   I just hope you have found some solace this evening but those reports are so convoluted, I bet reading it did not make you any more comfortable. The dogs are funny!   That is hysterical!  I have a camera that allows me to spy on my cat and also to talk to her!  It is hysterical when she hears me talking and is looking around, wondering where I am!   The last time I was engaged we lived together.  I remember me telling him not to tell my cat I was in NY and that she thinks I work on the side of the house because that is where she last saw me going when I drove from the garage!  Your dog's understanding that your dh is in your phone was so cute and it reminded me of that! Barb, I wish you the best.  Cancer is a lifelong disease and some of us will get mets, some of us will die of something else entirely and others will not have anything more to do with cancer.  It is all very strange and all we can do is support each other.  Please keep us posted. BTW, tonight on the evening news there was a report that \"scientists\" have finally declared the caramel coloring, used to color almost all colas, has distinct carcinogenic properties and is causing tumors in rats.  The one thing I did, and never did I think it was the caramel coloring but phenylketoneurics, was give up Diet Coke right after I was dxd.  I had no clue the caramel coloring to be cancer-causing. Enjoy every day and hope for the best.  This is all we can do. Good night, ladies-",

      "Content": "Feb 13, 2014 01:36AM 1WonderWoman wrote:  Good evening, Warriors! Today I was watching the news and \"Oh, Canada\" brought us a new study!  This is the piece that was run by the local newspaper: A Canadian study that many experts say has major flaws has revived debate about the value of mammograms. The research suggests that these screening X-rays do not lower the risk of dying of breast cancer while finding many tumors that do not need treatment. The study gives longer follow-up on nearly 90,000 women who had annual breast exams by a nurse to check for lumps plus a mammogram, or the nurse's breast exam alone. After more than two decades, breast cancer death rates were similar in the two groups, suggesting little benefit from mammograms. It's important to note that this study did not compare mammograms to no screening at all, as most other research on this topic has. Many groups have not endorsed breast exams for screening because of limited evidence that they save lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Critics of the Canadian study also say it used outdated equipment and poor methods that made mammograms look unfairly ineffective. The study was published Wednesday in the British journal BMJ. Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer and cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Nearly 1.4 million new cases are diagnosed each year. Many studies have found that mammography saves lives, but how many and for what age groups is debatable. It also causes many false alarms and overtreatment of cancers never destined to become life-threatening. In the U.S., a government-appointed task force that gives screening advice does not back mammograms until age 50, and then only every other year. The American Cancer Society recommends them every year starting at age 40. Other countries screen less aggressively. In Britain, for example, mammograms are usually offered only every three years. The Canadian study has long been the most pessimistic on the value of mammograms. It initially reported that after five years of screening, 666 cancers were found among women given mammograms plus breast exams versus 524 cancers among those given the exams alone. After 25 years of follow-up, about 500 in each group died, suggesting mammograms were not saving lives. The similarity in the death rates suggests that the 142 \"extra\" cancers caught by mammograms represent overdiagnosis \u2014 tumors not destined to prove fatal, study leaders concluded. The work was immediately criticized. The American College of Radiology and Society of Breast Imaging called it \"an incredibly misleading analysis based on the deeply flawed and widely discredited\" study. Mammograms typically find far more cancers than this study did, suggesting the quality was poor, the groups contend. In a letter posted by the medical journal, Dr. Daniel Kopans, a radiologist at Harvard Medical School, described outdated machines and methods he saw in 1990, when he was one of the experts asked to review the quality of mammograms used in the study. \"I can personally attest to the fact that the quality was poor,\" he wrote. \"To save money they used secondhand mammography machines\" that gave poor images, failed to properly position breasts for imaging, and did not train radiologists on how to interpret the scans, he wrote. The study leader, Dr. Anthony Miller of the University of Toronto, said it was \"completely untrue\" that inferior equipment or methods were used. Still, the study highlights the fact that mammograms are an imperfect tool that lead to many false alarms, needless biopsies and treatment of many tumors that would never threaten a woman's life. \"Overdiagnosis is not an anomaly in the study from Canada. This has been compellingly demonstrated in research from the U.S. and Europe,\" said another study leader, Dr. Cornelia Baines of the University of Toronto. Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in New Hampshire, spoke on the issue at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December. \"Screening is a choice, not a public health imperative. There are trade-offs here,\" he said. \"The people who stand to gain the most from screening are the people at greatest risk of the disease\" \u2014 older women who are more likely to have breast cancer and those not too old that they are likely to die of something else, he said. Death rates from breast cancer have fallen mostly because of dramatic improvement in treatments, he and other doctors have said. \"The better we are at treating clinically evident disease, the less important it becomes to find it early,\" Welch said. A big caveat: The Canadian study was on routine mammograms to screen healthy women. No one doubts the value of diagnostic mammograms \u2014 more detailed X-rays when a problem is suspected or after a lump has been found. I thought it was an interesting piece and wanted you all to see it.  What I find most interesting is the part about over-treating breast cancers that would never become life-threatening.  I might have shared with you all that I feel many, many more women get breast cancer than are dxd and that the body just ameliorates the situation.  Some of us who perhaps have had those breast cancers that might have been squashed are caught in the mammogram/exam system and then they use us as subjects to learn more about the disease.  I don't mean this in a sinister way either, I think it is just the way it is. Interesting stuff nonetheless.  We have a glorious snow day here tomorrow!!!!!!  YAHOOOOOEEEE!!!!!!! ",

Sue: good to hear from you!  Time does fly, that is for sure.  That is a lot of kids, woman!   Good for you! I am still considering what to do on our 5th.  I am thinking August 2015 but not sure where we will land yet?! I don't get lymphomas.  I do know that my lymphatic system on the left side of my body  is not working so well mainly b/c my left ankle is constantly swollen until I get off of my feet.  Whether I am working out, walking etc.. it is always swollen.  At night, when I lay down, it goes down pretty quickly.  Who knows?!   Things to discuss in March with my onc. Ginger: I love the cold weather this year!  I just love it.  I have always been partial to cold but my favorite this entire winter has been laying in bed, 2 comforters and the window above my bed open while I gaze up at the stars!!  I love the cold air when I am sleeping. Last night it was 8 degrees here and I was in my glory!  It was 50 here about a week ago and I was boiling!  I am starting to think I should have stayed in Canada when I went late last year as I am oddly starting to prefer very cold weather! Good luck with the brace fitting tomorrow.  It sounds like it might be uncomfortable but surely it will be a means to an end.  I know what you mean about the Olympics as I was watching men's slope style moguls and one of the Italian Olympians came down so hard on his back, smacking it against the mogul, I shrieked.  It was awful.   The most amazing thing about the Olympics is physical accomplishment.  I really love it and I could watch all night.  I have to force myself to sleep around 4ish! Tex: how are you?  I hope you are doing ok, woman! Well, ladies, 3 more people I know have been dxd w/bc, all recently.  I think what they said on CNN on \"World Cancer Day\" is fast becoming reality: over the next 10 years the numbers of people being dxd with cancer is tantamount to what is now a brewing human disaster.   It is just insane. I think the reason I love the Olympics so much is it is hopeful.  Good day, girls! ",

Read some numbers recently about how the WHO anticipates  there will soon be more people on the planet with cancer than without. Just so not good.  My best friend's father and MIL have cancer now and both are on chemo.   Almost everyone you talk to knows someone, has a family member or both.  It just still seems to be rather anomalous that so many of us, in this group in particular, are so young to be going through this.   Hopefully we are forever on the flip side!

I am so glad to hear you are doing so well!   It is just awesome to read that you are feeling great!  I don't blame you on the surgery.  I would not do it.  I can't even think of what would make me go back in for another surgery...oh, wait, yes I can: CANCER!  That is about it! You are such an inspiration to me, you are just amazing.  Someone else I find inspirational is my eye doctor!  Seriously, he wants to go into law enforcement in New Mexico when he retires (long story about how he found out about this) so he has himself on a very limited diet to qualify.  A few years before that, while his horrible marriage was grinding to an end, he ate TUNA for like 6 months so he could get back in great shape!  Who does that?!  I have never told him but he really, really inspires me.   BTW the tuna thing is called the \"Harvard Diet\" I believe. How are the kids?  Glad you got some relief with the weather!  CT is nice at this time of year. Happy trails, girl!",

Fall is my favorite and I love smelling the wood burning in fireplaces at night when I drift off to sleep, secretly thanking Mother Nature for dousing me with cold air through that slightly open window! Yes, the hot flashes persist and as of late have gotten worse. Sharp and hotter! In any case, and more to this point, I am STILL STANDING as are all of you so on Thanksgiving, I encourage you all to take a few minutes to yourselves and dance around to Elton John's \"I am Still Standing\" video on YouTube! Just dance by yourselves, reveling in all you, and all of us at large, have been through and be so grateful for the life we still have! I think it is safe to say we ALL stood up to cancer! So, and before I forget, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL!!! My tree is up, the Christmas carols are playing and I am loving the fact that my cheeks are rosy like Santa's after going for one of my nice walks in this beautiful weather. Yes, I am silly! I will leave you all with this: recently someone asked me why I was so happy! Seriously, if they had the past 4 years like I had, nearly dying twice and finding out post bmx that what they thought was 1 centimeter turned out to be 2.5 cancer, 3.5 pre and had gotten into my lymph nodes, I am happy TO BE ALIVE! So few understand the gratitude one feels after nearly being snuffed out by this crap, to still be here. I know my warriors understand, however! Happy trails to all and I wish you all well, always, and remember that although I am not here, you all are frequently in my thoughts. We are one strong group. Your Fearless Leader",

It may be visualised as tethering or indentation of breast tissue. In most patients there is global symmetry between the two breasts as far as the parenchyma is distributed and imaged. By comparing MLO and CC views carefully, subtle areas of asymmetry can be found sometimes even very subtle areas not seen by quick look by by neophyte observers. Parenchymal asymmetry is a routinely assessed feature in mammography and usually means any undue disruption in the usual parenchymal pattern. It is considered third most-common appearance of breast cancer 1 and at times can be a subtle finding on mammography. The most common etiology in every day practice is post surgical scarring. Etiology being \"cause,\" it can certainly be attributed to scar tissue. Keep us posted and I am sorry you are going through this. They are probably just being hyper-vigilant as our collective history certainly warrants such! ",

I am so sorry, I fully intended to make our 5 year anniversary special via this thread but these classes are killing me! I was not good in this material *before* chemo and now, gadzooks! I feel like chemo took a lot more than I realized! Speaking of which, while watching Jeopardy I am still chasing the answers through my head, I was thinking \"Paloma Picasso\" a few days ago and said \"Paco Rabanne\" (talking about fragrance) which I knew was wrong as soon as it came out of my mouth! I also put Bush International in Washington and Reagan in Texas!!! These are classic examples of how I struggle with memory issues since chemo. It is sad, ladies! In any case, saw this today: http://breastcancer.about.com/od/newlydiagnosed/fl/Mammograms-and-the-Detection-of-Benign-Tumors.htm?utm_campaign=list_breastcancer&utm_content=20150326&utm_medium=email&utm_source=exp_nl Wonderful! We all might have been the victims of overzealous diagnosing! Actually I know I was not. There was 2.5 cm of cancer and 3.5 of pre-cancer they suspect would have gone active \"within months\" of surgery. In any event, I file this under \"better safe than sorry.\" Sptmm: HOLY CRAP!!!!!!!!!!! Deb, you look like an Olympian!!!!!!!!!!! You are just the epitome of athlete!!!!!!! I love, love, love the pics!!!!!! OMG, I have not been here in a while and it was so nice to see those pics!!!! I love it! Deb, you are like a freakin' super hero!! I am so particularly impressed with you and your dedication. You have morphed into a super athlete and I just love it!!!! You will be the recipient of our cape, in perpetuity, woman! Wherria: I really wish you would let us know how you are. This is cancer, we are all probably going to get it again and maybe even again (and this goes for everybody). I sat with an 80 y/o lady in chemo one day who had recur 4 times. I hate that you might not be sharing b/c of lack of company. Just let us know, give an update please---much love. Liz thinks she is an oncologist! My latest self dx (this might become a regular feature!): I was feeling a lot of pain across my lower back and in my neck and I got so scared. My onc is forever checking my spine and of course, my beloved Adey was quickly dxd w/mets to the spine so I do get nervous. Um, I kind of forgot I have taken to doing crunches \"on the rebounder\" when I finish a session....perhaps that is not great for my neck! Adey came to visit me!!!!! Seriously, if you all don't believe in ghosts and think me a religious blasphemer, go right ahead! Sorry, I believe in ghosts and shortly after I found out she passed, and I posted here, one night I awoke to a very friendly sounding \"whoooo!\" Yes, kind of like a friendly ghost sound! I have lots of dead family but that time, I think it was Adey! Ok, enough ghost talk! Well, we are on the precipice of lovely Spring and the season I despise, summer, ever since my luscious hot flashes began and do not seem to want to end! Timothea, I am with you on this one! They seem to have gotten worse in the past year :( Happy trails, ladies-",

I know you had been talking about that for a while, and I am glad you finally made it happen. I, too, am going to be looking south in another 5 years. I will likely never live in Florida full-time, and I won't do the \"snowbird\" thing yet, but I will be slowly be cutting over to spending more time in the warmth. I am sooo happy for you! Now you get to ride your Harley year-round! Do you think it will be weird decorating your Xmas tree in shorts?! My sister spent a few years living in FL and said she got used to it fast. A few years back I flew out of Jacksonville and it was 30 degrees there, and when I landed at JFK, it was 30 degrees there! You might not be in shorts at Christmas, but will likely be in less layers than in Iowa! BTW, on the sun, cancer and vitamin D thing, we only need about 3 minutes in the sun each day to get our RDA, so don't overdue it!

Is it nothing short of insane that a whole bunch of us, many of whom were in their late 30s and early 40s, are here to celebrate our SIX YEAR ANNIVERSARY since chemo?!?!?! This is soooo very exciting! My new avatar celebrates the very nice job they did on me! Drs, Au and Kwei were amazing! For any newcomers, Dr. Au has left Smilow and gone back to Penn Med. He is super talented, so don't hesitate to get a consult with him. Unbelievable work. Dr, Kwei, unfortunately, is now in research, so she is not currently a practicing surgeon, but she did very good work as well, and if one is in need of reconstruction, consulting with her is a very good move, should she return to working as a surgeon. So, my question to the few of you who still frequent this thread, what have you learned about your own resilience and ability to overcome in these past 6 years? I am perfectly stunned that I am still here. I was positive I was dead, like very dead! Every day is a gift. I still feel as if I am only 1 lump from trouble, and these next 4 years are pivotal, as you all know. I hope we are all here to celebrate the 10-year mark, and in the event I am not, I want you all to go and party without me! I think the 10-year deserves a trip to Vegas! I am no gambler, but there is something to do or see in Sin City! I think we should organize a 10-year anniversary party. LadyinBama: so good to hear from you! You look absolutely fabulous! Your point about an 85% chance of not being here today is exactly what I am talking about. We are all so lucky to have dug deep and found the fortitude to push-on through an arduous battle with that disease. Poor you and Rachel had double doses. I am so happy we are all still here! This is the article Lady is referring to, btw: https://www.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-... I know it sucks, and b/c of my age, my onc is considering taking me off Tamox and putting me on an A.I.. I don't want to take it, and he said it increases my chances of survival just a bit, but I don't want all of what you are talking about, and that seems to be what a lot of women say about it. That said, were you ever on Tamox? I would not go off of everything entirely, but if it makes sense for you to be on Tamox, why not go back on that if it is an option? If, however, it is not an option, I would stay on. I am actually a bit scared to get off Tamox, truth be known. If it is the A.I. or nothing, I would stay on it. I know, it is awful to put up with all those SEs, but the alternative... I am sorry, Lady, such an awful situation you are confronted with. I still have wicked hot flashes with Tamox, and I am up most of the night. I have all but eliminated carbs from my diet, hoping that would help reduce the flashes, but it really has not had the desired result. All my best to you when making this difficult decision. Ginger: did you go on an AI? Just wondering. How are you doing these days? Are you settled into your new home yet? I sure hope you have set up a sewing room! I do sew on occasion, and I think of you when I do :) Hope all your pets are well. Wherria: congrats on no bone mets, but I agree with you entirely about asking for a scan. They do NO scans on me whatsoever. It is downright scary, actually. All they do is feel me for lumps, and they do some bloodwork. The only scan I had since dx was at Dana Farber and it was a head scan, which uncovered I had a broken shoulder! I was so scared when my onc called me and left a msg it was necessary to discuss the results of my scan immediately! Best of luck with the bone scan, and even more luck to you in trying to get them to do it! Well, ladies, that is all for now!!!!! I hope you all are enjoying the warm weather!! I enjoy walking in my neighborhood, mainly b/c there are a lot of hills, but I actually like walking the back roads now because the landscaping is beautiful, and the smell of flowers just seems to drift along the breeze. It is gorgeous these days :) Happy trails to you all!!",

I am so glad to hear about your pets are largely doing well. That is so funny about the cat, that after 18 years, decides you are okay! I had a Chihuahua who hated my fiancé, and I mean visceral reaction! Eventually I would break up with him, because I figured the dog was on to something! Bottom line is over 3 years and that dog never developed an affinity for him in the least. Of course, people would tease me after that my dog was ruling my life, but I had to take heed! In the case with your cat, however, they are just tough. Cats are very hard to win over! Cats will fail to bond for reasons unknown, and are hardly the barometer for caliber-of-individual that a dog can be. Cats are truly finicky, but I love them no less! That is a shame about the tremors. I hope that calms down for you at some point especially in our world-of-texting! That has got to be tough. Congratulations on the house!!!!!!! Raised ranches are great, and when I was young the lower levels were always party rooms for all the kids. My friends had the best swing in their lower level! It was one of those wicker swings that hung from the ceiling, it was way cool! We had so much fun down there. I am just glad you were able to find something you like in that hotly contested real estate market. Deb: you look FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!! I love that pic! Running with the snowy background! That is good stuff! At one point I was living with a boyfriend and it was a year when we got hammered with snow storms. We were going crazy locked in, so we finally started jogging in the snow, in the city! It was fun, a few wipeouts, but it was fun! I am so glad you have found some silver lining to cancer. It is hard to even think about a silver lining, but alas I think most of us have had them. Swimming at 6AM?!?!? My first roommate in college used to go swim at 5AM, and I don't think I need to tell you all I was just getting in about that time! She and I did not last as roommates! That is great, though, Deb. I learned how to swim when I was just 2 years old. I think my parents knew that the older kids would kill me, with their whirlpools and cannonballs, if they did not provide me adequate means to survive! Swimming is such great exercise, so I apologize for taking the \"WonderWoman\" moniker on this site! You can have it if you would like....!",

I just realized that both Felisa and Whitney were in a bit of a crisis situation, and we have not heard from either in a while. To anyone reading this: If your news is good, bad or indifferent, please come back here and let us know what is going on. Yes, the crew is rather Spartan now, but it is my sinking suspicion if anyone finds themselves in harm's way again, we will be back, sending positive vibes and wishing you well. Cancer is a life-long disease, we should stick together!!! So I saw on public television this morning that cold-cap therapy has really come a long way, and fewer and fewer people are losing their hair now. Also there are some very auspicious developments in dealing with triple negative bc. Overall much of what they said was very positive about dealing with bc, and I was stunned at some of the developments that have come along now, like micro-dosing chemo. I can't remember everyone's experience with chemo, but I used to go for 7-hour infusions of 3 different kinds of chemo. Well nowadays I guess they break that up into several smaller doses. I thought that was interesting. Something else I learned this past week: Neulasta is really going more mainstream, and helping those that are afflicted with white blood deficiencies for reasons other than cancer txs. The good thing about bc is the news just seems to keep getting better, so keep exercising ladies (the HUGE message on the show this morning), and we could all see many more years! Your (forever) Fearless Leader!",

Sweeney: U R BAAAACK!  Albeit temporarily...I know!   Good to hear from you.   Glad you are doing well and feeling better.   Yes, the daily hospital trips must be a drag.   I don't look forward to that as it will be near summer by the time I start rads and the hospital is 1 hour away, roundtrip.   I am just so happy to hear, from the front lines, that ENERGY comes back!  I so want to get my daily workouts in again and FEEL like I have worked out rather than 20 minutes on resistance 1 on the recumbent bike!   Ann: I think we all are going to make some changes but I don't think it is going to be a cognitive choice but rather things will fall into place differently going forward.  As for the survivor comment, I did not understand it.  It failed to make sense to me.   I just let people talk because I don't want to get into some conversation that makes me seem like I am negative on the labels but, to be quite frank, I am not sure when/if we are ever called \"survivors.\"  I don't mean this in a negative way but I perceive myself, going forward, as living with cancer as opposed to beating it into some mythical black hole.   Again, it is all perception and whatever makes you feel good about the situation.  After done with txs, however, I would do a survivor march, I guess?!   So weird that I am hung up on the semantics!  Rachel: Sorry Kel and I have probably scared you on this Saturday morning with our myopic view into our messy, disastrous healthcare system!  Believe me, in CT I am house, car, sales and state and fed income taxed not to mention other fees etc... Sadly we are, as a nation, taxed the S out of and we still have no universal healthcare.   It is a mess. Texas: You adopted a kitty!!!!!!  Good for you!   Poor, poor kitty!   They always break my heart.  I donate to a local no-kill shelter and when I brought my donation the other day, there was a little kitten (8 weeks) who looked just like my cat with a milk mustache and white boot paws etc... but she had been promised to someone.   She was nearly in my car!   I am a one cat household, however, so I would have really had to think about that one.   I was animal-free for a short period which was when I was thinking of moving to Ireland but as I can't take my cat with me (she would have to be quarantined for 6 mos) I had to shelf that plan for another number of years because I adopted this poor thing from her life along the highway.  Good for you for adopting ;) Scanners: am I the only one happy I am not traveling this Thanksgiving?!   Geez...of course the first person to punch a TSA agent was from CT!   In addition the exposure to radiation with the scanners?   I don't know....there is no way to monitor this stuff without such invasive steps.   WOE IS US!!!!!!

I plan to travel the world with the VNA and any information you have would be greatly appreciated. My career plan is still quite amorphous. The next step is just to get through these educational hurdles. Texas: communication is everything. If you don't empty the tank and let them know what you are thinking, and they you, we cannot survive in relationships. Too many misunderstandings and hurt feelings with lack of communication.

Chapstick: they are totally benefiting from my bc. I must have purchased 20 to add to my collection and I consistently am misplacing them.

I think the doctor might have been leaning toward a more ecumenical decorative effort as opposed to the pink tree....then again it could have been the pink tree?!? On the BF shopping trip, I need my head looked into! I can't believe I did that either even though I was only out of my house for a total of 45 minutes! You guys have inspired me! I would have never thought of buying a Wii used off of CL! NEVER! I don't have kids and don't love games but I kind of wanted a Wii for the \"fit\" series. I just did not want to spend all that money but now if I can get the Wii off CL then I can buy the \"fit\" stuff new and cut my costs way down. That is a great idea. Plus when my nephews, Godson and friends with kids come over, I am sure they would like to have some Wii fun! Claritin: I never had allergies so I never had to buy this stuff. I was a little surprised it is $25 per box but that is ok. I bought a bunch of it, like $150 worth, to get me right to the end of chemo taking it 1x per day. This morning I went into my bathroom to open up the next box of 24 and I also had another box of 10 just to cover the last 8 days between the last box and my last chemo. Can you believe someone STOLE my Claritin? I was stunned. I called my best friend, who went shopping with me to make sure I did buy all that Claritin and sure enough I did. I knew I did.  I cannot believe someone I know, or don't because there has been a lot of traffic in this house, stole Claritin. My friends are not morally or financially poor or at least I would like to think so. In any case, I will be hiking off to CVS to buy another $50 worth of Claritin. People are sick to steal from someone with bc. Sad folks out there today. Twitching: people are going to think we are WINKING at them!!!!!! I get the eye twitching also but, unlike some of you, my potassium consumption is pretty low these days. Zachsmom: I am with you. I am tired of this as well. I have a surgery in Feb to fix a failed TE then I have fills then another the surgery for the permanent implants and then radiation. After that I have 1 more surgery. I am focusing on next year, next holiday season and NOT having to go through this all again. Don't forget they are being aggressive with us and we were aggressive with ourselves in opting for an mx/bmx so we don't have to spend the rest of our days in the hospitals/dr's office waiting rooms. I did the bmx so I could totally put as much of an end to the potential for recurrence as possible and to get the heck out of the medical industrial complex as quickly as possible. Last time I was in a hospital I was 17 getting my tonsils out and now I freakin' just about live there for the past 9 months. I am so glad I did not try lumpectomy, even though I was encouraged, because in my case, with so much IDC and DCIS, I would have been squarely in the system for about 3 years, if I lived that long, while they carved me up and eventually did a bmx or mx. I really think the DCIS would have festered and I would have had huge problems, if not be dead, way sooner than in having chosen the bmx which was 50% prophylactic. In any case soon we will be OUT of this system! I can't stand it any more than you.",

Omaz: I thought about the house thing. I also try to wear the same clothes to chemo because I am going to throw them out immediately when I am done. I also started a packing tote to put all my scarves, wigs, paperwork etc... in and it is going to the basement as soon as I am done with all of this. I don't want reminders hanging around. Don't forget you can move furniture, get new furniture, put up new blinds/curtains etc... and do something in your house you would have never done before. Change the décor...you will be ok...oh, yeah....and paint using invigorating colors...you can lose the whole bc reminder stuff with lots of paint! Lago: you are a potassium-consuming machine! All good stuff. I should get some dried apricots...in fact I will tomorrow! JSW: enjoy those games!  Your Thanksgiving company/entertaining story made me want to take a nap!  I agree on all who talk about the fatigue getting worse.   I am cleaning my house this weekend and at 1 I had to take a nap.  These naps aren't even a luxury but rather a necessity.  In any case, JSW, relax and enjoy that game! I hope you all are having a nice weekend.  LIke I said, cleaning house.   It feels good.   Thanksgiving did a number on the kitchen which is also why I don't like to cook because then I don't ever have to clean!   ",

I did not join a support group because I don't really take to those things too well if that makes sense? It is not for me. We are all periodically melancholy, onemonga, and sad so you should not think you are alone in that. That is what a support group is for ;) Calamtykel: please keep me posted on what your detox diet looks like. I really want to do everything possible nutritionally post-chemo for like 6 weeks. I can't stand that this poison has been in my body and want to do whatever I can to CLEAN my body out short of a master cleanse. I just think that would be too dangerous post-chemo but perhaps a colonic would be ok!??!?! As for the food at your chemo center, that is gross. Yogurt and fruit would be very nice. They do have sandwiches and carrots at Yale but the thought of eating in that room makes me want to reach for the \"in-flight\" bag!! CYBER MONDAY!!!!! Nice job on that computer deal! I just bought a used desktop off of CL for $150! I feel like a jerk now! Oh well...I have 5 computers so I should just shut up! I have one desktop that has been acting up and the other 3 are notebooks and netbooks. I wanted another desk top...I wish I had waited now! Oh well...I never get a bargain. My sister, however, has always been the one scoring bargains. Oh well....! Sweeney: HAPPY, HAPPY GREY CUP! Glad you are reading again. As for menopause, asking women in their early 40's to GLADLY give up their sex lives is wrong. I am no hot tamale since this chemo crap started...at all. In fact, I pretty much dismissed my boyfriend. I did not like him all that much anyway!!!!!! You all must think I am sooo harsh...perhaps I am! I just don't like settling. The other reason is entertaining that thing is a problem on chemo and you never know what they might do to find entertainment. Trust is huge and the idea of opening up my body to HARM in any form is something I am totally not interested in. I guess what I am trying to say is it is even harder when you are not married because now all those other things come into play. Bottom line is when I am mate shopping again, I will likely be more careful and demand blood tests before any contact simply because after going through this healthcare disaster I would NEVER want to open myself up for stupid trouble in that form. I don't, however, think if you refuse that part of your life, you don't have to. You might have to take some \"start me up\" stuff etc... but you will have that part of your life back. I just agree with everyone that at our ages we should not be entertaining \"senior sexuality!!!!!\" As for an uncertain future, that is paradox. The future has ALWAYS been uncertain! There was never a lick of certainty. The 2 words being used together is the epitome of an oxymoron! You have to live each day for that day and that day only. Today is the present, tomorrow is a gift and it has always been that way. There is nothing new under the sun. Try not to look too far ahead as you might scare yourself! I don't know about you but I suck at predicting the future! Take it easy on yourself. As for being upset with other drivers, I live in the NY tri-state= always crazy on the roads! I95 is like an amusement park ride! Sohardbnme: BREASTLESS is where it is at!!!!!!!! I still have my post-surgery TEs in! I have not had 1 fill! It has been great! I hated my DDs! HATED them. I used to run Central Park and my friend and I had to TAPE them down and wear 2 sports bras. In addition, I hated, hated, hated the attention those jokers garnered! It is so nice to have normal size, albeit fake, boobs! Foobs is what we refer to them as all over this site. Plus no more bras, no more mammos, no more stupid bc fears AND they don't move!!!!!!! WHOO HOOOOOO!!!!!!! I get my permanent implants in April. Looking forward to that. PM me anytime if you want to chat it up about the whole process. For me it is probably the single best decision I made for myself in a long, long time. I wish you the best and will be thinking of you on Dec 2. Keep us posted on where you are at with it all. Sauce: it came out grrrrrrreate! I love making sauce and meatballs. I use turkey for the meatballs and they are great. I love, love this and it is the one time when I actually get some good protein in me that is not filled with mercury!!! GO FDA! Sweet dreams to you all-",

Great also that you don't need rads. I have to tell you, though, my hat goes off to you between home-schooling 4 kids, battling bc and doing it all with a smile! You are an inspiration. I can't imagine how you can get to the online store more than you do now with all that you are going through. I think you have done all you can and have done it well. There is always next year for more sales. I am very glad you nerves have been calmed with reassuring news about coverage from the new healthcare company. The healthcare system in this country is scary especially because we are all tied to our jobs for it. Especially now, for all of us, with the scarlet \"C\" on our healthcare records...I mean does that ever lose it's power? Are we ever considered cured? Could any of us ever, for less than a gazillion dollars, be able to buy healthcare in the open market? Obamacare mandates they insure us but the cost of that coverage is up to the insurer. None of us did anything to get bc and now we are strapped with this dx for life relative to insurance. I mean after 5 years does it fade in the insurers perception? Bottom line is I don't think we are ever off the hook from this dx. I should have moved to IRELAND!!!!!! Sadly, all of our healthcare is going to keep going up. Anthem is jacking personal policies in CT some 30-40% I believe and now with Blumenthal going to Washington there is only a pretty good chance they are going to get away with it. CT lost the best Attorney General we ever had to that motley Senate race. I will miss him. Now it is all but open season on the residents of this state. He really fought hard for us.   Libraylil: Your Howard Hughes behavior will get you to and through that Friday tx! You will be there and you will finish that day....all done, goodbye chemo days!

If you are unemployed and without cobra or self-employed and find out you have cancer etc... you are not going to be able to purchase healthcare insurance anywhere in this country without the insurer pre-existing your condition and, as you know, thereby promising to pay nothing. What Obamacare does is force insurers to allow people with pre-existing to buy insurance but there is no cap on what the health insurance company can charge!!!! The final leg of Obamacare is \u2018Mr. Colon Cancer, sorry you could not afford the insurance companies rates when they did not pre-exist you but don't think you can just sit out there without insurance......noooo, you have to buy this *minimal* policy at this small amount just so we, the government, knows you have some type of coverage.' This is the plan currently in place in MA and that which got Romney a lot of negative attention during the election. The minimal plans that we must buy if you are uninsured and you have no spousal insurance through work etc.... is the equivalent of a state minimum car insurance plan simply designed to get you through a spot check. It is the individual buying a plan to keep themselves from NOT being fined by the US Government for NOT having insurance. It is a big, fat, costly joke but, be that as it may, I don't have a better answer. There is a healthcare bubble and it is going to pop. How does Adriamyacin cost 22xs less than Epirubicin? Who priced that out? We had a massive mortgage bubble and we had the whole stock bubble of 2000-2001 (second leg sponsored by 9/11) and the next, and far and wide the most crushing blow to our economy, is the impending healthcare bubble. Obama, no matter where anyone stands politically, is trying to do \"something.\" No matter who runs and wins the office in this country, they are going to be confronted with a looming and daunting healthcare bubble that has got to be fixed. How the heck can we, as chemo patients, be getting statements from insurance companies in the 10's of thousands of dollars ranges for this care? How can it be free across the pond, and north, but like monopoly-money charges here? The pharmaceuticals and healthcare companies have been allowed to get way too fat, riddled with capitalistic tendencies, and greed on the backs of our healthcare system. The US is their luscious cash cow and they fight with lobbies and all kinds of measures, every day, to avoid that tap being turned off. It has got to be, however. This is the only market in the world where they have been allowed to get so very far out-of-hand with costs. In the end, right now, no matter what state you are in, if you work for an employer with a large enough employee base, you cannot be pre-existed. Outside of that, pre-existing is the name of the game so anyone who finds themselves uninsured because of job loss, cobra run-outs or self-employed (with a policy that was at least reasonable before their dx) are completely SOL. The uninsured cannot buy a policy in this country that will not pre-exist their condition and the self-employed are going to see their rates rise. They are forced to get a job with a company big enough to not have to deal with pre-existing. All of us cancer folk now have to try to hide, make sure they can't track our disease through our credit reports etc... because eventually they will be tracking us and we will find it harder and harder to get jobs because the employers don't want to deal with the costs of our healthcare. It is a very precarious, slippery-slope and it is happening. All of this is not happening overnight as thankfully our system is not designed for fast changes! It is happening, however. So, in the end, those folks in NJ who could get insured for massive dollars for an individual policy were getting pre-existed anyway. It is just a moderate form of the soon-to-be healthcare minimum requirements. It will be the equivalent of uninsured motorist meaning you don't have to pay their bills but WHO IS? That is the question that looms large. Right now we have what I call \"socialized-unsocialized medicine\" because the insureds are grotesquely over-billed to accommodate for the shortfalls these healthcare providers are not getting from the non-payers. This is not a workable system, however. In the end, the government knew the baby boomers were the largest number in this country and they are getting older. This means the healthcare bills are going to be huge for that sector and Hillary Clinton tried back in the 90's to head off this mess to no result. In the end, it is all greed and corruption as usual. Now I am having a hot flash and am hoping to get back to napping!!!!! Some more \"Law and Order\" should do the trick!!!!!!!",

Dorothy Hamill:  She also had a battle with cancer and she has started a \"Love, Health and Hope\" diamond collection.  It is being advertised at Helzberg.com.  In any case, the signature piece is very attractive and I think we should all TREAT ourselves and get it!  We deserve it and it stands for all we have been through. Healthcare: my concern is employers and healthcare companies alike are going to start profiling us for all sorts of maladies, weight, illness, disease and eventually it might be hard to get a job at an employer who has benefits because you have been surreptitiously profiled.  For instance, with all of us who are not working: explaining a gap in employment might land us on a suspicious list if we are not forthcoming.   Also, if a medical bill gets reported to your credit that will be another profiling red-flag for employers and healthcare companies.  I am telling you, I see the American workforce becoming a lean, mean, disease-free machine until one of those machines gets a disease and then they will join the rest of us in the sub-par, government healthcare plans which are not even in existence yet, of course!   The entire topic is nerve-wracking.

Adey: 2010...2011....only a few days difference to be done!  I know you did not want to spoil your WILD NYE plans!  Texas: I have been meaning to thank you for teaching me something!  I had NO CLUE tastebuds last on average 10 days!!!!!!  How do you know this stuff?!?  Omaz: scrapbooking is fun.  I learned some cool tricks from DIY but then I got tired of that as well!  Speaking of pictures, I have some scanning to do now!   Good day all-",

Calamtykel: Olivia Newton John has done very well.  I do honestly think Elizabeth Edwards loss of her son some 14 years ago really did her in.  She even spoke of wanting to be reunited with him upon death.  The stress of the political run of her husband and his philandering, albeit stressful and surely did not help, were not tantamount to her failing under the aegis of this catastrophic health event.  Her heart seemed to go with her son when he died.  In the end, I really think each and every one of us has to choose our battles and try to keep stress as minimal as possible.   This is key to a holistic approach to dealing with the aftermath of this dx.  It can be done; we all, present company certainly included (!), have to be a little bit smarter about how thin we spread ourselves and what battles we take on.  It is one small step!     Well, I have to go back to the basement to get some stuff out of the dryer!  If you all don't hear from me I probably curled up in the laundry and took a nap after the descent down the stairs knocks me out! ",

My apologies for my absence this weekedn as I was sleeping off tx #5. Catharsis: This weekend I had a catharsis relative to what I now deem my \"chemo hangover.\" Although I am not done, chemo was \"something\" to get through, to get by, to put behind us but now, I find myself dealing with, and confronting, the very issue that tossed me into chemo. The past 10 months have been a whirlwind and now I am living with the idea that I am essentially sleeping \"within\" the enemy. BC has become a part of my life forever and as I ponder going back to school and continuing on with my education to become a nurse, I am reminded if I \"don't\" do these things and continue living my life, I am no longer living. Now, an awful lot of people with *no* reason to stop living do anyway. In the end, there is never a reason to stop doing whatever it is you are here to do and even though our collective bc dxs are startling they are just a blip on the radar. We must continue on and live our lives. I am, however, starting to fully assess the last 10 months and it is a sobering event! Dreams: I keep having crazy dreams I am at flea markets as they are closing up! I can count on 1 hand how many flea markets I have been to! Weirdo dreams...oh yea, my mind also reconfigured the entrance to Grand Central and it is far more lush with a cascading, meandering, shallow staircase that is just decadent! French toast: I actually made cinnamon French toast yesterday with the good, old \"Wonder White\" of yesteryear and it was good! No syrup but at least it did not taste like poison! I am sure we are all on brown breads of some sort and I have not had white in years and years but it was good as French toast! JoyKK: welcome to our thread! It is a good, supportive group. I hope you find some answers here and, if not, at least some solace ;) Weight: don't forget, our bodies use water to heal so I would not be overly concerned about weight in the post 8 weeks after chemo. I am sure our bodies are holding onto water for comfort after that gross, poison assault! This, however, is not meant to impune the experience of those of you dealing with LE. Totally different ball game. Zumba: if any of you like to dance and enjoy the occasional salsa or samba, this is for you! I am just doing the practice steps now in anticipation of being able to workout more in January. More to this point, however, it is a nice, fun workout for indoors. I have always enjoyed dancing and it is just a fun workout. Adey: hang in there, woman....we only have 1 more!!!!!!! I am going to try French toast again......! Good day to you all-",

Vegan: I hate the way animals are treated in our capitalistic, kill-kill, animal protein manufacturing business and have often thought of becoming a vegan.  In any case, I just realized I don't have to \"become\" a vegan to eat vegan!   Through CPTV I found that I am only 10 minutes from one of the best vegan restaurants in the state.  I had lunch there today and it was delicious!  They also rely on spices which made it very tasty and it did not taste like bug spray!   I am sure I will never call myself a vegan but will certainly be dining in this establishment again :) Sweet dreams to all of you",

Onward: I hope you got some sleep on those roids!  BTW, nice avatar!  You look ready to whip something up!  Sptmm: we ALL will be worried about recurrence into perpetuity.  I was listening to NPR the other night and they were talking about living with bc after all the txs are done and you are left with your own thoughts on the whole matter.   They said eventually you come to terms with the precarious nature of your existence and put it into perspective.  Their voices are sooo soothing on NPR, I immediately felt at ease!  21 of 35 rads down?!  Wow, you are truckin' along!   Bras suck btw!  I hate them...I sincerely more of my desire to get a bmx was predicated on the very idea I would NOT have to wear bras anymore!   Get one of those large wound patches and put it over the area with something the rad onc allows you to apply for comfort.  Sounds to me like aloe vera might be nice.   Whatever just to get the bra away from the burned area. Lisasinglem: I am not exactly the focus subject you wanted to hear from because I am not done yet but everything is a tiring struggle just the same and #5 is next week.   Last night my arms hurt holding Joe Torre's book that I am now reading.  Just this morning went to the basement and came up and was winded.  Then I put the garbage out and recycling = tired again.  Had to sit at my little bistro table in the kitchen.  Then I rolled the hose roller into the garage= tired again.   I am secretly scared about the fatigue and being winded.  I have more stuff to do today like bloodwork, go to CVS, Lowe's etc.. and surely I will have to take a nap when I get home!  If I were you I wouldn't walk but I would race to the program at the YMCA.   JSW: GETTING OUT OF JURY DUTY!!!!!!!  A definite perk of luscious chemo!!!!  Good for you!   I was so petrified because we had that big home invasion murder trial in CT and I, so far, have not had jury duty.  I was worried that my ticket would be up during this trial.  To be quite frank, and because I am on chemo, I would have given some crazy answers just to get disqualified should I have had the dubious call to be on that jury.  GOOD LUCK on your first Abraxane tomorrow.  I wish you lots of fun and success!!!! Hair: I think Kel was saying how she has little whispers of fur here and there and then 1\" long pieces...me too!   I never totally lost all of  my hair....at least not yet.   #5 is next week and then #6 at the end of the month.  We shall see.   The 1\" pieces are mainly over my ears and the back of my head.  The ones over my ears are like an awning!   I might stick with a short style for a while after all of this.  I have gotten way comfortable with a quick shower and no \"do my hair\" fuss!   I have had long hair almost my entire life.  In fact, I was a total Tom boy and my mother always wanted to cut my hair because I was like an aborigine with it the way it was after a day in the woods of tree-climbing and fort-traversing and then swimming and bike riding...every night was a struggle for her to comb through my hair after my bath.   The first thing she did after the divorce was get my hair cut as she knew my father would not be maintaining it!  In any case, I grew it out again as I went through my teen years.  I am rather looking forward to a somewhat simple, shorter style!",

Lady: I think there comes a time when you don't feel as sharply as you once did because you are going through so much.   I think we spend our tears on much greater matters that plague us these days and perhaps we don't have any left for other stuff...thank God!   I would hope we don't have an endless supply of tears!  This past year has been a whirlwind for all of us and I just think you get worn down a bit.  I don't think you have to worry that you are becoming emotionally anesthetized but more like just worn down a bit. Omaz: OMG....I can totally identify with sweat running down the forehead!  I am so tired of that blonde wig, I want to burn it!   I was standing in line at Walmart and sweat was rolling down my forehead and onto my cheeks. It was one of those warm days when they had the heat on...I nearly left the store. Libraylil: I have to agree with you and others who have pointed out that at least dirty nodes indicates the nodes were working.  I don't think that dirty nodes is a death sentence but more like a life sentence.  You are right in that if it got to the nodes and the nodes trapped it then they were doing their job.  Again, I am so thankful for all of you! Lisa: great avatar!  You look really good. OK...sohardbnme, texasrose, wherria, and a host of others....where, oh where have you gone?!?  Texas is probably still blaming the kitten for computer problems!!!   Should you not stop by to say hi before, and if you celebrate, this coming holiday, I hope you all have a lovely, lovely time of it. I am going to go to bed...I am so tired and tomorrow is another one like today but not quite as much traveling.  I am going to sleep good tonight!  Night all-",

Omaz: I, too, keep wondering about her and her markers.  Her docs were so positive on ABC.  I was surprised she was gone so quick.  I was talking with a woman in chemo yesterday who has been a 17 year survivor although she has been back to chemo 4xs.  In any case, she was lovely, early 60's and I was so happy to have someone next to me who was so much fun!   She and I were talking about Elizabeth Edwards and I just think losing her son, her husband running again in 2004 and the subsequent marital problems probably did her in.   I don't know what causes cancer but last I heard, stress helps nothing.   I think the very essence of her life wore her down.  This is why I am also taking time now to reflect on exactly what I want my life to look like.  Trading and the whole Wall St scene very much agreed with me but I know now I cannot thrust myself back into that type of existence with cancer lurking about.   A less stressful life is necessary now so this is why I am going back to school for nursing and looking at some sidelines businesses I might want to start later next year when this is all over.  All things to consider and I think, to some degree, we are all going through this in some way.  In any case, looking at her type of cancer and txs is one thing although looking at the big picture of her life is a much more holistic way for all of us, somewhat similarly situated, to look at her evolution under a bc dx.  She just went through so much in the past number of years.   I hope she finds some peace now. Good day, girls!  I am going to try to get some junk done!  PS- you might notice me editing right after chemo because, upon review, I make the most silly spelling and grammatical errors!!!",

Omaz: You might be onto something with that undissolved stitch.   I never thought of that but when the JP drain got infected (I broke the fall of an elderly woman and the no-good-deed-goes-unpunished theme has been a part of my life since) there were stitches where the drain went in.  I don't remember them taking those stitches out.   This is a long and winding road, my friend!  Texas: That sucked about having to go back and forth, paying for each visit with your child, waiting for an infection to show.  I just remember when she was touching it it felt really full, weird full, like too full!  I remember thinking that.  Yeah, maybe it was not all red like it is today.  I don't know.   All I know it needs to be aspirated and I don't care if the TE gets ruptured.   This thing has been infected since JULY.   Swimming around in infected fluid masked by a perpetual of Cipro (on an off since July and on for txs 1,2 and 4 of chemo) so this has got to stop.  Honestly, the right TE is flat like a pancake (it failed...go figure!) and the left one is ready to explode out of my chest it is so swollen, I would like both gone.   My health is way more important and I am not going to continuing a lingering infection with perpetual doses of cipro and cephalexin.  They put me on both when it gets bad and why?  Because they were afraid the almighty TE would pop if they aspirate....oh yeah...keep the infection in my body and let's just be sure we maintain the integrity of the TE.  JOKERS!   I love my GP because he is smart and he has a heart...that is very, very hard to find with doctors.   IN any case, Tex, I am so glad you are back and you are settled in your new place.  Good for you   I hope Santa was good to you. Calamtykel: Are you out snowboarding with the kids?  You probably have an EZ Bake oven on the sled behind you as your whipping up some healthy grass bread they can eat when they get to the bottom of the hill!  I hope you are having a good day- Sweeney - have you left for the DR?!   I hope red dawn is leaving you soon. How did it go with the relatives over Christmas?   Hope you are well- Well, I am going to go dial Yale another 20 times and see if anyone got there yet!",

Calamtykel: that sounds so pleasant to sit by the window just absorbing a little sun! Good stuff. As for the workouts, good for you! That is so inspiring that you are right back out there. I mentioned I lived nearby a small ski resort and, needless to say, there are some pretty good hills. Up the road there is a steep incline and it has been my goal to walk up it backwards for a while! I am hoping January brings me the opportunity to do just that! I am so looking forward to workouts again. I am also glad to hear your shoulder is doing better. Good for you, Kel. I am glad it is all working out for you and that it seems to have been nothing serious. Wherria: I am glad you are back! I was getting worried and am glad to hear it was just the computer! Sorry to hear the SE are not getting completely better but there are some bright spots so therein lies hope. That is great that you had visitors and I completely laud your ability to keep up with them, even with pacing yourself, the very notion tires me out! I agree on the walk to the mailbox. It is so sad to have to sit down when I get back from a stroll up hill back to my house! It is good to have you back. Continued progress with feeling better and no more knocking the computer to the floor!!! JSW: I agree getting chemo in the winter has it's perks but the flu business is renting space in my head! I am isolating myself for Xmas and NYE because I, in the end, decided against the flu shot as I have never had it in my life, and don't want to run the risk of getting sick with just 1 tx left. I certainly hope you can avoid getting your husband's cold. Christmas shopping?! I was so lazy a few days ago, I went to CVS to get my nephew an Itunes card for his birthday and they were out of the $25 and $50 cards so I got a $15 because I was TOO LAZY to go to another store! I hope by Christmas shopping you mean online? That is what I should have done anyway but I got ambitious and I really wanted to mail a card. Alas my best laid plans...! I am going to try to get my file cabinet cleaned up today and get a few other things done. I have my list, as I do every day, and hope I get some things accomplished today. Good day to you all- Liz",

I want mine out but I think Yale likes to keep them for a year. I want it out as well. I have veins, man! I don't need this freakin' port! Calamtykel: You are funny! First of all, that reference to the Thirld World Hospital is hysterical! You better watch out that your anesthesia is not crack! That stinks about the heater. \"Rabbit\" makes excellent purifiers and I like the way they look! I don't know if they make heaters...you might want to check. It is very disappointing that a company that makes purifiers makes a stinky heater! In any case, good news that someone finally listened to your voice of reason and the plans are in place to take that thing out. Good for you. Omaz: It must be Zenith who is a Conan fan. I know someone here besides Sweeney (Berkshire) Hathaway O'Brien is a Conan fan!!!!!!! As for the fur, are you above getting some Chia fur to collate into your fur?!??!? It think if you grow the skull chia fur and then paste it on, you will blend in to the brush more effectively should you walk and fall again!!!!! Your DH can leave you there for a nap! Iowa: tell Santa you want an indoor pool! After a year like we have had, that is the least he can do for you! JSW: I can't believe you went to the mall! You should have filmed it! The post office: the bane of my existence! I have the laziest mail person EV-ER! S/he likes to leave me those little orange slips when anything won't fit in the box instead of coming to the door. So there I go with my mask on as our post office line is always at least 10 deep and people are just plain old sick at this time of the year in the Northeast. If you have a busy post office wear one of those surgical masks. People can stare at me all day and I can give a rat's fat ass less....I unequivocally do not *care* what people think! In any case, don't take risks...wear the mask as forbid you get sick. I have to go to Texas, I mean Walmart (!), and then to a crafts store (need more pencils for sketching 9/11 items) and then I actually also have to do laundry and clean up the kitchen. This will, no doubt, be a 2 nap day!!!! I think you should all write your own twisted Christmas carols today and sing them to your heart's desire!!!!! Good day, girls!  May the force be with you!!!",

What was awful also was that the infection and TE had been sharing so little space that when the infection started to swell, it apparently was pressing against my lung cavity and the chamber to my heart because my heart was beating like a racehorse with every slight exertion and my breathing was a mess. In any case, I am going to PM you to catch up. I am so glad the baby is good and that you stopped by again. My apologies for not responding sooner....I was so sick from the 22nd to just about today. Glad to still be here to respond to your post! Lisasinglem: that is an absolutely hysterical reference to \"The Hangover\" and me!!!! The first time I watched that movie I did not find it all that funny because I used to wake up from nights like that sans the wildlife! In fact, I found the movie a little scary at first! But I am older now so I am sure we will have a subdued time......! Ann97: can't take a compliment from the absolutely innocuous man at the airport requesting your digits?!! All because of some missing brows hang-up?! BTW, I, too, have that feeling that we \"did not get it all.\" I also watch \"House\" and he is always making fun of Wilson reminding him his \"crappy chemo\" does not help anyone! Well my BIL is alive 15 years later after having chemo and surgery in response to a nasty lung cancer dx. Chemo must be helping someone and I am sure what they are using today is much better than what they were using 15 years ago on my BIL so let's be cautiously optimistic. I do know how you feel just the same, however. Omaz: I love the avatar! Since we are putting up photos from when we had hair, I just might join you all tomorrow! Ckptry: I agree with Sweeney in that the people around you talking about how you crossed some finish line also draws on the notion you should be feeling better. I say eff it....you are feeling as you are today and that is the way it is supposed to be. Tomorrow you may feel worse, better etc... but give yourself a month or 2 to get over all of that chemo and the bodily jarring we all experienced. Keep your circle small also. I worked with a woman once who had skin cancer. You guys, you cannot believe how completely miserable she was. It was scary to me but guess what? Skin cancer did not make her miserable...she was always miserable and skin cancer gave her yet another thing to cry about. You have to be wary of who is around you. If they never had cancer they do not understand it and with our hormones completely off-track, just protect yourself, Caroline, and allow yourself to feel all of those \"words\" every day until you don't anymore. You *have* the right to be a little off these days as well all do. Don't question it...in fact, feel relieved that you recognize you are a bit off!! BTW, love the new avatar! Very nice photo. JSW: I am sooo sorry to hear about your cat. I know you said she was sick back in Oct/Nov. You can never, ever be prepared. That is so sad...especially around the holidays. I will tell you a little cat story that will hopefully make you giggle a bit. My PS came to see me Sunday and I remarked how I wanted to go home and how the \"team\" I had in place to check on my house was falling apart as the holidays were winding up/people returning to work and one of my friends has an unfolding medical drama in her family etc... In any case, I LIED to him as the team was not set up to watch the house but was surreptitiously designed to have a steady stream of visitors for my CAT!!!! When I got home, after a week in the hospital, I found her in the back of one of the kitchen cabinets, whining. No clue how she got in there but she was in an organizational basket so I slid the basket out and out popped the cat! I wanted her to have visitors while I was gone because she was feral, living along the highway and I know she is very attached to me and is a basket case when I am gone (heard stories from her previous cat sitters when I vacationed!). Consequently, I don't always let the team know they have been gathered up for \"cat visiting\" but tell them they have important responsibilities (he he!) like checking on the house, bringing in mail but the most important task I assign each of them is to talk to my cat!!!!! Good times, JSW! I am so glad the Abraxane is going better for you than you had initially thought it might. It is all together so much easier when this bulldozer we call txs turns out to be just a bit easier...just a bit is enough to make us weep with joy! Calamtykel: you equate summer with bc dx and that sucks. If I were you, I would plan very fun activities with the kids etc.. for the week you were dxd. You have to change what that timeframe means to you. Do not let bc steal your summer fun away. Bc was one thing, one dx, one bad time in over 40 summers. Work to erase the connection as quickly as possible. I am very, very grateful I was dxd 2 days after tax day because I have always loathed tax day! To the sores and the aches: I am just going to say it for all of us that it totally sucks that we had to put up with bc dx, associated surgeries, hospitalizations, tests, scans, MRIs, infections, hair loss, energy loss, lack of sleep, being forced to abandon exercise under labored breathing (and so many more items I am failing to list) and to this we must add perpetual soreness and aching? It totally sucks. It will get better. I know it does not seem that way but from all I have heard from those who are far ahead of us all on this journey said it does abate. I know that is no solace for you all now, however. Ginger: good luck at the radiologist tomorrow. I was surprised when I was told I did not need it so perhaps you will be as well. LIbraylil: best of luck tomorrow. I am sure your surgery will be a huge success. Don't worry at all. These surgeries are so routine to our docs now we pretty much have nothing to worry about. I will be sending the best vibes your way tomorrow. Lady: I have to agree with Omaz and how succinctly you summed up what the achiness feels like. That is exactly what I feel. I feel like I worked my legs but that used to be on the press to the tune of about 150lbs and now it is walking to the end of the driveway to get the garbage! Oh..it feels so good to be home and the first thing I did after calming Bibbers (my cat) down? Took a nap! Hospital was great but not great for sleeping! Goodnight, girls, and may we all get through this together. Let's get to Vegas in October!",

Perhaps your evening posts reflect that. The \"loosly cloaked comeback track\" was indeed hurtful. Would you consider getting together the statistics on this. You began this thread and named yourself as our fearless leader. Consequesntly I read every word you post, everyday. Your sister Ginger *********************************************************** I joke about drinking but I hardly ever drink NOR am I on the ecclectic mix of psychotropic drugs that the preponderance of our society is on and I don't appreciate that comment.  I have worked hard on this thread and no one is always going to like everything.  In fact, I don't always like what is posted but I accept as being the byproduct of an open forum. Regarding that comment, \"the comeback track\" is the money making machine.   They know full well we are going to be back for bloodwork, more radiation-based tests, more check-ups, mammos...the list goes on and on.  They also know  *exactly* just about to the penny what they can expect to MAKE going forward off fo a lumpectomy, an mx or a bmx and don't kid yourselves that it is not the case.  This is a money-making machine here and that is the fact.  We are sick with cancer but this machine only sees money. Furthermore, Ginger, I don't always appreciate your comments but I don't remark about it. In particular I did not like it at all when you commented that cancer was God's way of giving you time to say goodbye.  That is a little melancholy not to mention macabre and it was a very upsetting comment.   I know full well you all take off to PM land to chat it up about this or that but I, as the moderate, DO NOT engage in any PM'ing to complain about comments or things that are being bantered about and I won't.   I refuse to, it is not my place.  If you have complaints about what I say post them on this thread but don't, in a very commodious and rude fashion, PM me with ludicrous suggestions of being under the influence etc...  I have not even had an alcoholic beverage since I have been on chemo for that matter. To keep this forum open, post your comments here.   Liz",

I don't let cancer run my life. He totally inspired me to get back to school for nursing also. He put the happiest, most enjoyable face on that profession I have ever seen. It was such a pleasure being there and spending time with him. We are going to keep in touch but I can truly say it is the one time in many, many moons that I have met someone and we had such a profound affect on each other. Good stuff! Sweeney: the wound is not uncomfortable...in fact I have no feeling at all. What is wicked uncomfortable is packing gauze into a hole where my boob used to be that is now 8 cm deep at the longest and 5cm deep at the shortest...very weird! Calamtykel: I am sorry I missed this. I was napping! I cannot believe how scary that must have been. Hopefully the ultrasound reveals nothing. Don't we all have some naturally occurring cysts that kind of float around? Before bc I never had any issues but my sister had some breast cysts etc... so perhaps it is a cyst? Of course, if we did not have bc accepting a lump is a cyst is much, much easier. Wishing you the best with this one. Sptmm: I will be thinking of you Thursday. I hope your results are fine. I don't know what is worse...them finding something or waiting for the results. JSW: I ate salad right through with feta. I remember at one point I posted that I was not supposed to eat feta and someone set me straight so I ate feta again and it had no effect on me at all. Libraylil: looking forward to hearing from you soon and finding out how your surgery went. I am wishing you the best and excellent margins! Texas: congratulations on your heart results. That is really, really good news. Good for you. Also glad they cut the 8th...don't think it was within your best interests. Ginger: good luck at the radiologist. Let us know what happens. Zenith: this entire experience, from beginning to end, is quite enough to cause weepiness. Let it be. Sometimes it is cumulative also like you finally realize what you have been through and you are crying rivers for the months you have been enduring this process.",

I should go grocery shopping but I don't know what to buy anymore.  The VNA reminded me beans have lots of protein.   When you all make smoothies do you just toss various fruits in the blender or do you add milk/water or a smoothie mix?  Any info is appreciated.   I think I am going to move to smoothies and keep on with Boost.  I don't feel like eating anything and I am also on Augmentin which causes stomach upset. Well, the Nets are beating the Bulls and I need to rest myself before I have to navigate that man-made orifice where my breast used to be and pack it with saline soaked gauze with the assistance of a tongue depressor!   Well, I am only pretty sure I have the stomach to be a nurse after this gauze removal and repacking business!  I cannot believe I am actually sticking my fingers inside of my body to do this....woe is me, girlies!!!!!  I am getting used to it, however. Have a lovely evening and sweet dreams to all-",

I have been so sick and all because this thing was infected ah-gain.   What I don't understand is I saw my BS on the 20th and she did not notice this thing was so infected?   That I don't understand.   in retrospect, all th waking up, burning up, night after night, I think was the infection in this breast starting again and not hot flashes.   I think if I did not put myself back on cipro I may have checked-out this weekend.  I could not get control of that temp. In any case, holidays are over, docs are back so hopefully I can get some answers and make a plan.  For now, however, my last chemo is definitely cancelled this week.  All I can say is this BC road is long and arduous.  The infection, putting off my last chemo and the impending TE swaps and not for the permanent but simply for replacements as the other one has failed completely, is easily going to tack 3 months onto my completion timeline.   Oh well...going to try to go back to bed.

Smoothies: thanks for all the help/advice.   I am going to start experimenting next week.  I just received the \"GE\" version of the magic bullet for Xmas.   I am happy I can put that to use now.

Sleeping.....I am so loving sleeping!  I know my body has been through a lot between the infection, chemo and the surgery although I do look forward to a time I am not so tired!  I am actually going to nap and then I think, for the first time in 15 years, I am going to make stew!   It is snowing...what else is there to do?!",

Ladyinbama: HYSTERICAL! I really thought it was snow! I told my friend in Atlanta, based on your pic, that you were somewhere in AL and you got a bunch of snow!!! I thought that was snow and ice hanging off moss trees!! Congratulations on getting the port out. I think that is truly the final sign we are done with chemo. I also had a question: how did you get the LE specialist to call you? Do you have LE or are taking the call or perhaps making an appointment as a pre-emptive measure? I was wondering about trying to see someone so they could bring me up to speed on the do's and the don'ts of activities etc... post bmx with regards to the potential to develop LE. I also wondered what the likelihood is of developing LE down the road, does it go down with time thereby imparting we are more likely to get it in the early stages after bmx/mx etc... Let me know how you were led to the LE specialist. Mommichelle: your fearless leader is very much looking forward to putting chemo behind her! What a long, strange trip. Gingerbrew: thank you for the well-wishes and I do so hope my ability to think and communicate comes back as quickly. One thing I hated about chemo is when I had all those crazy dreams, I could not talk in my dream. I would be trying to yell or get someone's attention or simply talk and I was unable to. I could not open my mouth and when I finally did, I struggled to say anything. I thought for sure it was my fear of not being able to communicate and process well in my waking hours. Since the last chemo I have not had those dreams....here they come again! JSW: I am so glad the abraxane is a nice, easy, quick infusion and one with no se. I am so glad you are finishing it up on Friday. Good for you. We are getting to the end of this \"poison\" part of treatments. It is nothing short of grand that Abraxane is being studied to replace taxol/taxotere. The fact that the se are seemingly non-existent is great news also. I know it affects everyone differently but I don't think anyone has said they had little or no se on taxotere/taxol so hopefully Abraxane is the second coming! Libraylil: we all find it hard to accept good news! CONGRATULATIONS just the same! That is great news. Makes you feel good. As for raloxifene, you need to be post-menopausal to have that. Zenith: I love \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and Larry David but I don't want his baldness! Geez, I hope by summer we are all celebrating a nice, short style. I can't believe the neuropathy is lingering for you and Ginger. I am so glad you stopped at 5. I have 1 toenail just about gone and another is probably going to bail after this next tx. I am so glad this is the end. Next is the port out and then I deal with all the plastic stuff. I am so looking forward to being able to workout again. I am tired of this lethargy and feeling of grotesqueness that luscious chemo brings! DH is the best for walking your little dog! I had a Chihuahua, appropriately named Chilly Willie as he was always cold. Well I lived waterfront in CT so the winter was brisk and lovely, little Willie did not like his boots! He would balance on 1-2 legs to avoid using those boots! He drove me crazy so I understand your plight. He did, however, love his kangaroo fur coat! I hope your vision turns out to be ok after the opthamologist appt this week. Good luck on that one. I hope it turns out fine and is just something that will clear up the further you move away from chemo. Ckptry: some of the oncologic professionals, as you know, prefer to err on the side of caution and I think that is why they cling to Tamoxifen. It is very tried and true....as we all struggle with the side effects! Also, I am sure at your age you are pre-menopausal so you would have to go on Tamoxifen. I just love chemo brain! Omaz: thanks for the info on the AIs vs. Tamoxifen. Your post was very informative. I like to know the particulars with pills, how they work and what they are designed to do especially when I am expected to be on them for 5 years. It is really surprising that a hysterectomy does not guarantee entrance into menopause. There is no way to get away from Tamoxifen! Well, I am high on pre-chemo steroids so I got tires on my car, went grocery shopping, did 5 loads of laundry, knocked 6' icicles clumps off my house, went to CVS and am ready to lay down and watch some tv in hopes I can drift off to bed at a decent hour....like after Conan!",

In no less than 30 minutes he created such a beautiful, New England icy waters, fishing boat ocean scene. It is so beautiful...but it reminds me of chemo!!!!!!! In any case, it was such a nice treat.

I was rather hoping you would become so terribly successful with your venture you would not be going back to traditional employ...unless you wanted to?!

I am going to the store shortly as, of course, we have to stock up for another 3 days of snow and ice, and I will be getting the 5 ingredients for my favorite Rachael Ray \"under 5 ingredients\" soup = spinach, broth, tortellini, lemon (for zest) and parmesan areggiano (absolutely key!). You put the broth and spinach into a stock pot, let it cook down, add tortellini, grate lemon zest and cheese over top and you have one very easy, delicious soup! Rachel: may you absolutely NOT have a bladder infection! Well, getting ready for the VNA, who was trying to schedule my weekly visit for Weds (the massive ice/snow storm), decided today might be better (sunny!) and I need her to look at my wound.

Good to know you have a nice neighbor and they came to you in your moment of need. They say there are no coincidences. Did you hear anything yet from the results of the Friday surgery? Yes, my hair sticks up also....lovely. Texas: did you watch \"Skins?\" Of course I was watching \"Jersey Shore!\" I watched part of it. It seems good. That Jersey Shore is getting tired so there is going to need to be another show to garner interest. How did your doc appts go? Ann97: new avatar ...looking good! Ckptry: you will never gain peace of mind through more scanning. Like you said, they will be chasing benign findings and that will be driving your more nuts. I would take a break from scanning, in fact that is what I personally plan to do, for 1 year. Give yourself a break. Rachel: How did the appt with your med onc go? No, we never do get off this rollercoaster. I find out now that even if I went for a 2nd opinion on radiation, I cannot get it now because of the open wound where my left breast used to be and that which will be there, open, until July when he attempts recon again. I also wonder if the infection affected the efficacy of chemo because I had the infection all through chemo and, of course, the infection was in my bc breast. The rollercoaster indeed never ends. Good luck on the bone scan tomorrow. I would think you pulled something when you were coughing. Another few days of waiting on results...sucks. Sptmm: I understand that they only scan with symptoms as so many here have indicated and as my docs have told me but what are symptoms?!?!? Not a single one of us knew we had bc....I was the only one that says I had joint pain and was very tired coming up to dx but most people w/bc say they had no symptoms. I don't understand what symptoms would cause a scan. Sweeney: did you stay in the DR an extra week?! What is up, Ireland?! Are you going to tell us about your fab vaca or what?! Well, trying to get myself ready mentally for 1 more gross tx. We are getting an ice/snowstorm here as well and I was unable to get to blood work today. I am hoping I can get out tomorrow or Thursday because we have another snowstorm on Friday and another on Tuesday. This massive amount of snowfall is very unusual for CT. I am not happy about this.

Lisasinglem: Have a great time in Durango!  Iowa: the lady that had mets after 13 years is an example of progress being made in treatment as she was able to benefit from something that was not on the menu when she was first dxd.  That, if nothing else, should give us all hope that even if the distant future, should we have recurrence, we will benefit from the standard of care at that future date.  That is the definition of hope!  JSW: not so good news on the extra cells in the epithelial layer but certainly going onto rads quickly is.  I am sorry to hear they did find additional cells but they seem to think it is so sparse that perhaps rads now, a later retesting and a plan of action from there is what will benefit you most at this time.  Cells....damn cells!  Unbelievable that you, too, are scheduled for a muga regularly and I have to fight to get one ordered at Yale.  I don't understand. Lady: so glad things are going well and you are feeling good.  That is amazing how they \"take\" your ovaries out through your belly button!  A-mazing!   Guys, I know we have gone over this before but please humor me: if I have a bad time on tamox and I want to get a hysterectomy to \"close down\" the estrogen factory, does that then negate the necessity of tamox?  I know some of you have had hysterectomies but I don't know why tamox after a hysterectomy is necessary.  Tolerate me and my chemo brain, please!   Goodnight-",

I guess this is to pad the driveway for the next 12\" that are coming tomorrow! I was so disgusted when I woke up and, as I have complained about being the last house on a dead end, the plows leave a mess for at the end of my driveway and because I did not call my plow people yesterday to request service as I did not think I would need it, I had to shovel out the end of my driveway...what a way to start the day. I was an hour late for my appt but alas I was hell bent on getting here, snow or not. I did not want to put this off. Yay for my last one. Tirade away with your son!

I will be doing the no-more-snow-dance for all of my Northeastern sisters today! Man, my shovel and little snow blower has never seen so much action. Oh...this is a funny one: yesterday I had to traverse some 3' of snow on my lawn in a steroid-induced energy driven desire to knock the 7' icicles off the front of my house and the snow came up to the top of my thighs. I almost got STUCK on my own lawn! I would have been so embarrassed. The reason for me getting stuck would be, of course, that the snow is ladled, layered and topped with ice! What an awful, awful ordeal! Riding my energy high, and with the mail truck stuck across the street, I also decided to skate down my driveway to offer assistance and I was the only neighbor to do this! Me, out of the hospital a few weeks, sick, tired but high on steroids, there I went! He declined has, sadly, he blew the transmission trying to get out of the snow pile the ice landed him in and had to call for back-up! What a sorry, sorry state of affairs we are in! Good day all-",

It feels good to have it over with but I will admit, as I was leaving, I did see a lot of people there who were on in years (75+) and I could not help but wonder if it was their first time through chemo...or not. I hope that is the last time I see the chemo room but, and this is very telling, when I was talking to my onc today I remarked as I am glad all of my professionals (PS, onc, rad onc (even though will not have it now) ) are all in my age range (under 50 on all 3 I believe) b/c cancer is a lifelong disease and it is comforting to know they will all be there...hopefully. It is just nice to be surrounded by professionals I can count on to be there as I continue down this road. Hoping to God I will never, ever NEED them again once this bought is over with. I just found it very odd that out of my mouth came that comment about cancer being a lifelong disease. I guess that is how I have felt about it all along and that helped me to take it in stride. I guess I feel once indoctrinated into the \"C\" world, there is no going back. It will, in one way or another, always be a part of my life. I tell everyone it is like the flu as they can treat it but they have no cure. Calamtykel- where have you gone? Have not heard from you in a while. Adey: I am waiting for the Vegas thread. I get antsy on cruises! I like the idea of Vegas. I am looking forward to it. Of course I still remember my TAC acronym explicit understanding! Adriamyocardialinfarction was the best! I asked for a post chemo muga today (are you getting one also?) and my onc pretty much told me they don't do them but I requested one just the same. I just want to know my heart is still in the shape it was when I started. I am admittedly a bit tenacious about wanting this piece of information so he booked one for me...thankfully. I don't know why but I am really hung up on wanting that result. Sptmm: I am so glad chemo is over and am praying for mild/no side effects. As for the icicles, I used my handy shovel to keep me 7' and to ram it so as to help it meet gravity, it's original target! OMG...on the damn next snow lambasting, we are expected to get a foot starting at some point tomorrow and going until Thursday morning...unbelievable. This means I will have to go for Neulasta on Thursday, before the 48 hour mark because if I was going to do it after the 24 hour mark that would put me mid-storm! I just love that I have to plan my much-needed chemo txs around storms. May this winter end quickly and may that little bastard on Staten Island NOT see his shadow! Remember when he bit Blumberg a few years ago?!? Lady and Libraylil: thanks for your well-wishes on my finishing chemo...YAY indeed! Texas: hey, hey! Super long posts are important as this thread will exist into perpetuity, as long as the site is in existence and undoubtedly long after you and I have left the planet at 80+ years old! I think I was the last with the wicked chemo infusion schedule of 6 TAC and this makes sense as I was the last to start! How did the 3 monkey bathing go?! Sohardbnme: inspirational quotes, joining gyms and cruising in May? Someone has truly moved far beyond the gross business of chemo and GOOD FOR YOU! This makes me very happy! Cruise it up, workout and have all the fun your heart desires ;) Lisasinglem: that Tom's of Maine thing has been around for a long time. I am sure, like in your case, it has it's place. I just wanted to know if unilaterally I was to be using it. I am no more impressed with that than I was with that icky Biotene! Omaz: I have heard a number of anti-depressants help with hot flashes. I think Lexapro is another one or at least they are studying it for that. Why not is what I say. A number of people are using them and I have not heard any complaints...but then again they are on antidepressants so what is there to complain about?!??! Just being silly! Please, for your new pic give your husband the phone to take an action photo on your next walk, say, if you were to take another little, glamorous, Hollywood type of spill!!! Now a great avatar that would make! Lady: your experience with Effexor sounds positive. Crying and being upset about something you cannot change and have no control is tantamount to a disastrous emotional meltdown eventually or, if not that, certainly a lot of heartache over nothing. Try being medicinally calm and happy for a while...it sure as hell beats angry, upset and crying! Still on the roids so still fired up....wanted to go shopping until I realized what time it was! May sleep come my way tonight...went to chemo on 5 hours which is 10 less than I require these days! Goodnight, girls-",

A serious problem with Adriamycin is that it can be toxic to the heart muscle, and can lead to heart failure. Doctors have developed strategies to minimize the risk of damaging the heart muscle with Adriamycin. These strategies include: avoiding the drug altogether in patients who already have heart disease; keeping the total dosage given to each patient below a certain \"threshold\" value; and monitoring the patient's cardiac function by means of the MUGA scan.",

I feel totally like I am falling right the heck apart! Ginger: thank you for signing the petition. It benefits all of us. If cancer research and prevention funding hits the cutting room floor, we are all totally affected. I hope to benefit from that research going forward if I have mets or a recurrence as I am sure we all do. I don't want that funding cut so thank you for supporting us both! JSW: ah, yes, good ol' synthroid! I have been on it for years. I think the vitamin D is very helpful. I get about 200% of RDA. Good luck on Wednesday! I will be thinking of you and sending good thoughts your way. I hope all goes well. Re-excision should be fine. I look forward to hearing your report of how well it all went later this week! OMAZ!!!!! DONE WITH RADS!!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!! Good for you...what a milestone! You must feel so good to finally be getting beyond down this long road. I personally am tired of the whole thing and I see my onc tomorrow to get my tamox rx.... I am a little concerned about starting tamoxifen...oh well. I must try it and see what happens. Perhaps I will be lucky?! I guess you will be on the anti-estrogen train with me soon! I hope we are happy travelers! Rachel: good for you on the gym. When I started to run again on the treadmill I did 2 min walking and 2 jogging and kept on like that for the duration of my session. Even walking 3 and jogging 1 and eventually you will be running again! Good luck. Texas: alas I am NOT eligible for the AARP scholarship because I guess you have to be OLD and BROKE to qualify. I am so aggravated...it is just like when I went to school in my late teens. You had to be living in a refrigerator box to be eligible for financial aid or scholarships. Few are truly *just* merit based. I found out for the AARP scholarship you can not have earned more than $16500 last year!!!!!!! Sure...would you like to come to my refrigerator box?!!! I live in Connecticut...you can't even get a refrigerator box for $16K!!!! I hope you had better luck with the criteria for some of those. I was not able to apply for AARP b/c the site was down yesterday so I was just able to start the app today...woe is me! On the Komen walk, 60 miles?! Geez, Tex...that is quite a journey! I could walk from Stamford, CT to Wall St in New York for 2/3rds the amount of mileage you will put back with the Komen walk!! Thanks for signing the petition. We need all the help we can get! Broken dipstick and jokers at Walmart?! Just go to AutoZone.com and order one. They cost like $15! Then go get your oil changed. I don't blame you for laying into them. You have 3 kids eating ice cream...obviously you want to get a move on! OMG...I don't know if I ever told you but I have a spare car that I needed a spoiler for (guy backed into me with a truck at a rest area and took it off with the liftgate on the back of his truck!) so I called this place in Texas to order it. I asked him why y'all (!) have so many UFO sightings in Texas and he said \"don't you know everyone wants to come to Texas!!\" I was hysterical! Maybe they are looking to get to that Walmart with the food court and fool-service auto center!! Sptmm: I was talking to my sister this morning about how tired I am of snow and being cold. My brother has lived in FL and TX for the past 20 years and my sister lived in FL for a few years. She is looking to go back and I may hitch a ride!!!!! I am so tired of this weather. We only got 2-3\" so I was able to use my small snowblower and did not have to call the plow for the 12th time this season! Seeing as you missed this last one, a reminder that we are in for another storm on Friday and again the potential exists on Sunday....so ready for Spring. Lady: hit \"browse\" button next to where it is asking for a URL and it will bring you to another window where you can search your computer.  Go to your picture folder and highlight the photo you want and hit \"open\" or \"save\" or whatever the non-cancel option is in that window and you will be able to post a different pic. My problem is none of them are saved in the right format, this computer won't talk to my blackberry, when I email photos to gmail they are not in the correct form for this system to open, I turned off my 2 netbooks as I am not traveling anymore and my other desktop has the same issues this one does. This avatar business is tricky but not on the top of my priority list so I will get to it when I do! Right now algebra and trig studying is more important! Libraylil: that was a ridiculous remark by the NP. First, new \"boobs\" are not going to help your nipples get back to working order. In fact, you will just end up with the \"headlights on\" look all the time and I have to explore the dubious world of pasties! In addition, your question was germane and not requiring flighty responses. If s/he works at a hospital, I would wait a little bit and then contact patient relations. You should not have to tolerate such chicanery. In any case, I am glad they got the fluid out and hopefully you are feeling more comfortable with your situation. Does anyone know if tamox increases our potential for LE? I am wicked tired of going through all the permutations and traversing medically spooky highway speculating about what might be around the corner for me. Also, I find the further from chemo I get, the more I am in tune with every ache and pain etc... overly concerned it might be mets/further problems. This bc also causes paranoia and perhaps hypochondria!!!! Meanwhile I suspect the government with their false \"things are getting better\" chant are causing people to have a false sense of security in the economy and this is, in the end, going to cause inflation.  I knew this for a while in looking at consumer spending rising but jobs are not increasing and raises are, for the most part, off the menu nationwide so where is all this money coming from?  Savings....bad news!  Ok...I am through with my tangent! I am going to watch Chelsea Lately now!",

Years ago they did some testing on me for cervical and I have to go to the gyn in a few weeks for my annual (truth be known b/c of the bc crap, it is a semi-annual!) and am so petrified they are going to go poking around and find something. I am so sorry for you, however, in working there and having been dx'd at the same time. I was just telling a woman at the muga scan that I am lucky I got cancer in an expendable body part because for so many \"c\" is very scary because they can't get rid of that part and it is in them. I am just so sorry you had to go through that. Iowa: I am sorry to hear about your husband's coworker. That is what I mean about the cancers that are really not manageable.

A lot of the bc/c scholarships are for people under 30. I am a senior citizen at 40!!! BTW, on the foods with naturally occurring high levels of estrogen, I was told by my onc's office everything in moderation.   Clearly I am not going to follow this advice!   Why would I want to eat a food that was high in naturally occurring estrogen when I have ER fed bc and am about to take some nasty pill that will shut down my estrogen making factory?!  You really have to be your own advocate.  Well, I hope you all have a nice day. I am off to try to figure out how to eat now that I have both bc and hashimoto's thyroiditis!!! I think perhaps a steady diet of milk and dust will keep me healthy!!! Good day all-",

One thing I have found out for sure, through my pre-studies for nursing and through online research, is the liver is primarily what drives metabolic function.  \"Sluggish metabolism due to sluggish liver and too much estrogens are contributing factors to weight gain. When the liver fails to eliminate estrogens efficiently, the excessive estrogens stimulate fat cell production, usually around the lower abdominal area and upper thigh where estrogens are more concentrated. Estrogens also bind to sodium which retains water and leads to weight gain.\"   What I am more concerned about, however, is the estrogen component of the liver.  Apparently nature has given our liver restorative powers so I will be doing some cleansing and letting you all know how I feel after.  All I know is it is an absolute travesty that the only signs of a troubled liver are poor digestion and lethargy meanwhile, when it is upset, our friend killer estrogen makes fat cells which do what?  Make MORE estrogen!  Great...just great!   I am going to cleanse the entire kidney, liver, spleen, gallbladder group over this next month.  I will post my findings here.   Geez, Louise...I feel like I am becoming a nurse and a nutrititionist at the same time!",

Just a note on the liver/gallbladder flush: it can be dangerous because at the end of the 2 days you have to drink some olive oil (forget right now if it is ½ or 1 cup) and this causes the gallbladder to contract. If a person has gall stones, and most people have no idea they have them as they largely go undetected for long periods of time and have no symptoms until the situation becomes critical, the oil causing contraction can also cause a stone to get lodged and this would require immediate gallbladder removal. It is only recommended to do this under the supervision of a doctor. Ckptry: your son should absolutely be able to play ALL THE TIME at school and they should totally lay off that work idea!!! Geez...can't a kid have some fun?!?!? It is good that he is in therapy and talking about his fears with you. That is very cathartic. I hope the hypotonia clinic is informative and helpful and that you enjoy the weekend in MD. A friend is a nurse at Johns Hopkins, it is a great hospital. I sure hope the potty issues get resolved and, you are absolutely correct in that, as you get stronger he feels safe unraveling a bit. It is a process and I am sure he will be fine soon enough. JSW: I hope you are doing ok. Check in when you can and let us know how you are feeling. That paper gown story is wicked awkward! I have gotten so completely unaffected by nudity, my non-boobs hanging out etc... I have just become anesthetized! I guess that is good and bad but, to be honest, I feel like my clothes have been off for a year and unlike my NY days, this time it was not too much fun!!!!!!! Rachel: I learned through my research you are doing right by your liver and spleen when you have that slice of lemon in your water. I am pretty sure you were the one who mentioned this way back when. It has very nice cleansing properties for the organs I have become very concerned with lately! Omaz: I have other pics from my hair was dark (my natural color) also where I look even more happy and fun-loving! Thanks for the compliment. Sptmm: I hope you have a lovely time at that soccer tournament. On the cleanse, I will keep you posted. I am going to consult with my doc before I do it because lord only knows I do not want anymore surgeries! The innocuous takeaway from some of my research has been have sliced lemons with water and drink 8 glasses per day; use Chinese bitters once per day; do yoga in the morning to open up your lymphatic system; take goldenseal as a tea, in capsule form or as a tincture to support the lymphatic system and encourage lymphatic cleansing; and finally, and the most obvious, eat fruits and vegetables as much as possible. I continue my researching every day and will let you all know as I find out more. We need to get this crap out of our systems and restore our organs to a state of healthfulness. Of course, the pains in my abdominal area have, in no small part, fueled my research fire! Have a lovely evening, girls-",

I just dumped the pill in my chops with my morning vitamins and synthroid and down it went....with the help of chocolate milk!!!!!!!! He he he!!!

Gyn visit: she was cool, quick, easy going, near my age and all went well. She simply told me if the pap is good, I will get a card in the mail and see you next year. Oh yea, she also said BRCA+ should get oophs. We also talked about fat cells and their desire to make estrogen and the exercise connection to knocking down estrogen is intense exercise. She likened it to a track runner in high school with very little body fat and intense workouts. She said they will have very little body fat and therefore their bodies don't have the opportunity to make estrogen. Geez, I can't wait to finish nursing school as my new avid interest is in the human body and how it works!  She also said tamox is well worth any SEs as it's benefits far, far outweigh the SEs for us bc girls.",

As for Pten syndrome and the bc 38-46 potential for dx, by then it will probably be like the flu...no cure but very treatable. I seriously don't think cancer is going to go on being the threat it is today. We are hitting critical mass with the baby boomers moving on in years and hitting the healthcare system all at once. I do think great things are going to come out of such a huge number of individuals plowing through the system with all sorts of maladies. Best of luck with the swap out and may the force be with you! Tex: what is going on, woman?! Are you busy doing those practice tests? Btw, if you are intending to try to get in for the September semester, take the TEAS about 2 months before. Do ½ hour (or more) of practice exams each day and then order the flash cards and other study materials about 1 month before. Be methodical...the stronger you come out of the TEAS, the better getting accepted is going to be. I would imagine you are trying to get in for Jan 2012 though, right? Let me know. Hope you are well.

Sptmm: GOOD FOR YOU!   4.0 w/an 8 incline is a great workout on the tread.  Don't be afraid to try the Arc trainers...now you get a lot of bang for your time buck on that thing as it is a hybrid of the stair stepper and ellipitical.  I usually do that at 10 and 100% resistance with handweights....we are talking 750 calories burned in a 45 min session...good stuff!  5 times a week to the gym is also great and shows good commitment.  Don't be one of those women afraid of weights...go lift, woman!   Don't forget, muscles are a jacket for your bones so build them up!   I was always in the muscle pit and there were always ladies we called \"cardio queens\" who were skinny-fats!  They had drooping butts, back of arms that were soft, no muscle definition etc.. and that is all because they did not want to get \"big\" through weight lifting!!!!!  That is such a hysterical myth!  First of all our center of gravity is higher than that of a man so we can't develop that level of strength and, second, and lifting makes your muscles \"smaller\" by squeezing the water and junk that is sitting in them thereby making your muscles tighter, you get better tone and a better infrastructure so don't be afraid of the machines!  Also, go into the free weights area and work your traps on the smith and do some garden pickers also!!!",

Iowa: I am doing crosswords each day.  It is helping but today I went all the way to the grocery store and FORGOT my wallet!   That is not a good sign! I never thought I would say this but I think I am going to miss being hairless compliments of chemo!  My scalp felt so smooth and my face, without my ethnic-induced facial hair, was so nice and smooth as well.   I just got out of the shower and I can feel my mustache trying to make a comeback as well as my side of face hair aka my beard!!!!  I am also not looking forward to waxings!

I don't know if I can motivate people to eat right but, as you all know, I am studying biology.   I am going to share this little excerpt that will keep you all exercising! When more sugar is available in a cell than it requires, FAT DROPLETS found next to many mitochondria will produce fat (geez...thanks!).  Then when an energy deficit arises, the mitochondria will break down the fat droplets to yield energy (keep exercising!).  Excess fat droplets are transferred to specialized fat storage cells (yikes!). SO, that is the biological disaster how fat is created!   Also, the words of my gyn ring in my head \"the bigger the fat cell, the more estrogen it can make.\"  I did not realize my bc battle was going to lead me to study biology then to subsequently find out what is really going on and launch a war on my own body to try to negate estrogen production!   So be it!   ",

Sohard: you have been very lucky they found this and found it before it could move.   Also thank you very much for telling me what a Pet Scan is for.  My onc told me he wanted to have one and, of course, congruent with my general resistance to too much testing, I was complaining about it!   Geez....he probably just thought he would leave me with my thoughts for the day in hopes that I might wake up to what a pet scan does and it's value!!!!  Sometimes I feel bad for the onc's and what they go through with us!   That pet scan result and BRCA result is excellent, excellent news for you and you are SO LUCKY!  I am serious and they are managing your situation so that they kill anything with the chemo before operating which is exactly what they should do.  It sounds to me like you are in good hands and even though we are all going to have a hard year, we are collectively in good hands.  We are the lucky ones...we are being cured.  Please, please...I urge you to strongly consider the nature of your next surgery.   Just talk to all your docs to do what is the most advantageous surgery so you don't have to be in this position again.  I wish you well and I will be here for you. UPDATE on me! still on Cipro getting over infection then the port and then chemo.  I would imagine I will be starting around mid-August so when I do our list tomorrow I will put myself at Aug 15th with a question mark. Also, if any of you have questions about the SE's of each flavor of chemo you are on, there is an existing thread for it.  I want us to meet here so each one of us knows there is a place where everyone is just like us, going through a challenging time and here to make each other smile.  It is entirely possible it might not even be challenging!   Keep smiling...it works!

      "Content": "Jul 29, 2010 03:42PM 1WonderWoman wrote: Hello All Just so everyone knows, I will do weekend updates on our list. Again, any ideas on how to better structure the list are welcome. I think it is proper and fitting that each person be recognized and appreciated for not only their start dates but their duration of treatment and type of treatment as well. I hope you all are happy with the format. Lisa: no problem on putting the list together and best of luck on your August 2 start date. The list is designed so we can all send positive vibes your way on each date. I will be thinking of you on August 2. Rachel: I am going to add you to the \u2018type confirmed but date unsure' this weekend. I wish you did not have to join us but I sure am glad to have you! You can stick with us right through as even me, when I actually start chemo, I am going to be going for 12 weeks so I will be lurking around this thread for a while as will many of us. StCards: when I first your ice recommendation I thought it was worded as if I might lose my TOES!!!!!! I had to read it 3x's to realize you meant nails! Thanks, as always, for your contributions to our thread as we sure need all the help we can get!!!! Joking girls...we will be fine! I am your fearless leader....!!!! Michelle: thanks for your information on your first treatment and how things are progressing for you. Also the stool softener idea...easy to forget unless we have thoughtful posters reminding us ;) I am glad day 6 is getting better for you and, as for your hair, when/if it does come out, 5 weeks after it is over you will start to get a decent amount back. I am pretty sure I am just going to do bald because of the summer heat, or head scarves, and you never know: you might like it bald for a while! Like I said before, this is the only time in our lives (hopefully!!) we will ever be able to see ourselves bald and to experiment with different options! Have fun with it! Jet: I am going to miss your crazy avatar but I wish you well! Thanks for stopping by and happy trails! Donna Kay: don't delete!!!!! Stay here and speak your mind...even if you are not on chemo! Lisa: your short hair looks really good. Very nice cut. Wherria: Welcome! I must say our dx's are very much alike...nearly same dx, same sneaky/surrreptitious cancer, same \"why did this person get this,\" and you are a IIa and I am IIb. Our differences are negligible and the anomalous natures of both our cancers are quite similar. I love your avatar...looks like you prepared your fur already! It looks good. I was stunned when I read your post as our entire experience is nearly parallel. In fact, we were dx'd only 5 days apart. I am also TC x4 but don't have a start date b/c getting over infection I caused by helping someone else and causing my drain to have to be pulled prematurely as it was ejecting itself from my body and the pooled fluid got infected. Our only other difference is I went straight bmx right away; no lump or mx...I don't have much luck and was too afraid to hold onto the other one! Most importantly don't apologize for length ever. Discuss, write, let it out...that is what we are all about. Welcome- Calamtykel: Welcome! Our dx's are exactly the same except your tumor was about 150% smaller!! Mine, however, is a little on the sneaky side! I would not hesitate to drive to the chief of onc at the hospital in NJ for treatment even if the locals are on board with their treatment plan. The difference with him/her is that if you have to change/need a new type/something needs to be tweaked, that is when you want to be at the big hospital. Something to consider and thank you so much for joining us. We will all pretty much be together on this thread until Halloween! Let's make the most of this and, as I used to say to my friends who smoked cigarettes, smoke them before they smoke you!!!!! Let's smoke cancer, girls and have a nice holiday season! Deb J: Welcome and thanks for joining us! A mom, wife and grandmother is why you get tired! Joking...honestly, I was bmx'd with immediate recon on June 22 and my energy peaks and falls hard daily, still. I guess it is going to take time. I am not really paying attention to it b/c with chemo starting shortly, I feel my energy might not be all that great for a while so we just keep marching toward the future and, as they say, today is a present and tomorrow is a gift so keep smiling! Lisa: you make a very good point about how everything on this journey has been far better than the crippling anticipation of events yet to come. Don't fret...we are all in this together. At least you have an onc/chemo staff that is setting up appointments for you and taking care of what you need. I, however, have been submitted to a non-Yale, unprofessional circus where no one follows up or makes appointments. Alas I will deal with that this week as I am over the infection that stalled the chemo pursuit. (wife of) Sundiego: Welcome and I will add you this weekend! We are going to make this experience as pleasant as possible for all. Nice to have you with us. Huntreiter: Another August girl! Happy to have you join us. I will update the list this weekend. As for the hair, they say not everyone loses hair, but the preponderance do, and it usually starts to go shortly before or after the 2nd treatment. I am going to wait for it to start going and then I have an electric razor and I am going to have a friend buzz cut me. If I actually do a full shave, I am going to go to a barber especially as we will be in a sensitive position relative to cuts. I would stick with the comfort of your own home...you know how weepy everyone gets over bc!!! I would NOT want to be sitting in a salon! Rachel makes a very good point in that in 1 year we WILL be looking back on these ridiculous choices we are being forced to make and laugh! And if I have my way we are going to laugh our way right through chemo!!!!!!! DebJ: the best prep you can do for chemo is mindset and everything else will be fine. Millions of people have gone through this and are walking amongst us talking, laughing, living and loving. This is only as big a deal as you allow your mind to make it. The only thing we can control is our reaction to the event because we have no control over what has happened. On that note let's all take control of our response to the situation and, like that old 80's song goes, \"don't worry, be happy!\" The last time someone told me worrying was going to make a matter better was never so throw that tool away. It has no place in this space!!!!!! What a journey we our collectively embarking on and we have only just begun. Let's roll!",

I want you all to remember we are walking among people EVERY DAY who are alive because of the profound and life-enhancing benefits of chemo.   You must remember, this is not poison but rather a catalyst to annihilate every cell, in every corner of the body that may have gotten away during surgery.   I know it is a few months of waiting and wondering what the SE's might be etc... but don't wait for them to show or even expect them for that matter.  Don't sit around waiting for the car accident that might never happen nor the airplane that is not going to come through the roof of the house.  How do any of us know what this is going to be like?  Expect the best...please....because the last time someone told me worrying about something was going to help was NEVER.  We have picked up some new members: Please welcome: Calamtykel LadyinBama  (*love your signature tag line...very nice...starve your fears!) Zachsmom mlv2356 ****who is also starting to get healthier this week on 8/5* Scrabblelady I thank you for joining this group of people who are taking care of themselves and doing what they have to in an effort to achieve optimal health.   We are in this together and if the day is good or the day is bad I want to hear from you all.   The purpose of this is support.   In our every day lives we have good days and bad days and this is just our every day lives and the potential for good and bad days exists just as it always did.  There is nothing new  under the sun except for the fact that we have extra support from each other in this chapter of our every day lives. I wish you all the best and please remember to check the \"ON DECK CIRCLE\" to wish all of those starting to get healthier our most positive vibes and best wishes. Thank you all for being a cohesive unit and for helping each other.   Remember also that their are women out there who have yet to join us and they will look to us for guidance; what we share here will be here as long as bc.org is in existence.  We can have a powerful impact on those yet to join us so let's do our best to lend strength to the future.

Libraylil: good idea on the Pandora bracelet...in fact, clever!  That is a nice way of marking each one as DONE and giving yourself treats as you go through this process.   Good for you.   Also, I have not been to \"Look Good, Feel Good\" but if it is internet based, I will check it out.

Sweeney: I am totally for the whole bald thing!   The only reason I got wigs and hats is b/c I am going to be going through December with chemo now and it gets cold in CT!  Yeah, they do look like dead animals unless you want to pay thousands!   The scarves are ok...I hang earrings off of them and adorn them a bit.   Oddly, I am embracing this time to try some different looks.  I guess I feel I have been remanded to this chapter in my life so I am going to make the most of it!   BTW, I forget who, but someone said their sister owns a wig shop and using ponytail holders to secure the scarves instead of trying those tricky knots is best.   That was good advice. DebJ: I understand you want to get to work but don't forget that your immune system is way depressed.  I work in a building with 300 people and by this time in the year no one has sick time left, their kids are back to school soon bringing home every flu and virus known to man and b/c have used up their sick time already, they all come into work sick.  I would be cautious about going into crowds etc until chemo is done b/c, from what i understand, with our white cells down, we can't fight much of anything, so any infection is tantamount to blood infections which can be fatal.  I am sure your oncs have talked to you about this but if I was a schoolteacher or someone who works in a huge building with people with no sick time left for the year, I would be cautious about work.

I also do not want anything free but what i don't understand is how come discount programs could not be set up for us like at Walgreens for cancer meds and at Pro Form to buy exercise equipment or Nike for sneakers etc... These huge corporate sponsors get such huge write-offs for altruistic programs they are so incredibly likely to get involved.  I don't want to change the world but would like to know why bc and other \"c\" patients don't have discounts off drugs already set up or discounts with companies where they can get healthier etc.. like exercise equipment without having to live in a refrigerator box to qualify!

BTW, this next part is going to be gross but I am going somewhere with it!   I got my ultrasound, which basically found the cancer, around mid-March.   Just before that I woke up from a nightmare where a cockroach was leaving my body by crawling out my eye and all I could see was the underbelly of the bug while it was leaving.  I woke up wrecked.  I usually don't remember dreams, don't have nightmares and I have not seen a cockeroach since I went to my friends railroad flat in Hell's Kitchen in NY and...well, gross!   Before that it  was college.  My point is this: I don't know that the nightmare foretold anything but what I do know is cancer is like cockroaches and it is as hard to get rid of.   I remember them coming to spray at college over and over and over again and they never seemed to leave our dorm.  The only person I heard of having success was an ex of mine who would become a heart surgeon but when he was in med school, he lived in an apartment where the roaches were non-stop.   He would buy cookies and leave them in the oven with boric acid on them!!!  He would not turn the oven on but leave the door ajar.   This is how he got rid of these nasty bugs.  Chemo is our boric acid! One more thing: I read the other day cancer loves sugar....anyone heard of that?   Just wondering.  I thought it was interesting. Happy trails, girls...I know this is hard but we have to do it.  It is a bitter pill with a luscious result!!! Your FEARLESS Leader!   ",

It still does not make it any easier to deal with, however.  I know the neulasta shot was challenging for you this past time and I wish you a better experience this time.   Have a good night- Liz",

The purpose is twofold: for those yet to join us to be able to read our experiences with ease (so they know when they see these monthly updates from each of you starting with the below sentence they can see how each month went and what the lowlights were!) and also for each of us to track our own progress as it might be cool to look back on and mentally it helps us mark the end! An example of how this might read is: After my first month on chemo this is what I remember most about it: I had 2 tx's and (insert a few sentences). Second: now that just about everyone, except myself and a few others, have started chemo would you all like me to put your \"regimen\" next to your name now that we are all settled in? Let me know. Consequently, to do this you all would have to PM me your particular regimen and I would list them where TBA's and the \"On Deck Circle\" used to be.

My story is as follows:  First mammo at 38 showed shadows but they were not investigated.  Here I am at 40 telling my GP I don't want to go for a mammo (cancer was in my breast clapping!) b/c I don't want to be exposed to radiation!   He encourages me to at least get an ultrasound as he has a traveling unit that comes to his office weekly.  Well, she almost put that ultrasound device through my breast when she found it (cancer is no longer clapping and I am getting nervous!) and that was March 17th or, as us Irish folk know it, a great day to party!!!!  The mammogram was about a week later and I was quickly told by the radiologist, in scary terms, that there is something very suspicious there and you need to have a biopsy.  That is the ONE time when I really broke down and cried as her delivery, coupled with the news, was a severe coupling!   In the interim I met with my breast surgeon, she ordered the core biopsy and on April 17th, or 2 days after tax day as I like to call it!, I was confirmed.  I went to my BS one more time and she explained to me how cancer grows but gave me little to go on, and no literature, and sent me on my way to make a decision.   Hello bc.org!  I had so many of my questions answered here.  I was scheduled for bmx on 5/17 but my BS' staff screwed up paperwork to my STD (short-term) co and the Friday before my Monday surgery I get a letter saying my claim has been closed as of the day of surgery.  I called the BS' staff and they insisted they had done everything correctly.  I asked for her to call me.  She called me and was YELLING at me about how great her staff was and how they are infallible etc...  My boyfriend, another friend and 75 yr old census worker were sitting at my dining room table stunned at the way she spoke (on speakerphone) to me.   I told her she was on speaker and there were others listening and I was nothing short of appalled at the way she spoke to me.   She went silent as soon as she knew she was on speaker and others had heard her.  I cancelled that surgery the next day. Off to Yale I go, which I should have done to begin with, and found myself one of the most talented and well-respected surgeons.  She is amazing and I wish I could clone her for others similiarly situated!  The PS from the first team, I am sure for political reasons, would not remain my doctor so my BS referred me to a PS who did is so philanthropic as he spent time in Africa helping women who have bc and, naturally, are medically disenfranchised or his presence would not have been needed!  His eyes are pools of caring and he is a very nice man.  In the end, I ended up with the best team I could possibly get.  June 22 the bmx took place.  My recovery was short because my team is so talented. Two nodes were dirty so off to the onc I go.  My BS referred to someone near my home which meant I was going back to that facility where I had fired my first BS!  Sure enough, it was like a high school event with the onc, of my choosing, opening our meeting with \"so what bring you back this way!??!!?\"  I could not believe it!  His staff never set up scans, follow up appointments, etc.. nor would they return calls so I perceived as a moderate form of black balling me.  Finally after 3 weeks of that crap, I realized they are NOT going to treat me and back to the BS I go for a referral.  This is why I am starting chemo so much later than I thought I would be.  The unprofessional staff at the glorified walk-in medical center near my house summarily ate up more of my time, playing with a woman's life who has bc.  In all, I lost 2 months since dx to those jokers.   That original BS I fired is driving the acrimonious bus, of course.   In any event, here I am going to my new onc on August 10th.  Congruent with every other experience I have had at Yale, he and his staff are professional and assuage all of my concerns.  They are wonderful.  I feel so at home and comfortable at Yale, I can't tell you all but it is 30 minutes from my home which is why, albeit briefly, I considered getting chemo at the place closer to my home but, in the end, I fell safer at Yale so the hour drive is well worth it.  No scans had been done so my new onc had to get all that had to take place and the port etc.. so here we are, starting in the beginning of September.  Yale is absolutely phenomenal and everywhere you go, all they do is pull up your name and they have everything, from every dept etc.. so there is also no dragging around scans etc... In the end, it all worked out but it was time consuming and with the potential for skull mets so said the bone scan, I am not happy about the 2 months I lost but this is the resutl of having to deal with unprofessional jokers with that walk-in medical center near my home that calls itself a hospital.  I would not go there for a nosebleed now! Very good news: my BS who I love so much totally dedicated her practice, as of today, to breast cancer patients only!!!!!!  She was a general surgeon before and I was so happy to get that letter in the mail as bc at large just aquired a hero. So, as JSW so eloquently put it, I will be closing our August chemo parade with my huge drum and hat!!!  That was so clever. This was my story! Your FEARLESS Leader!",

Zenith: almost guaranteed you will NOT be having chemo Thursday.  With a pending infection, it would terribly injurious for further incapacitation of your WBC with our WBC-ruining pal chemo!  Take it easy and get as much protein as you can.   Write down your temperatures and the times taken also.  I am only pretty sure that might help your docs. Another new member!!!  WELCOME drbeall and, as I tell everyone, I am so sorry you meet the criteria to be with us but I am sure happy to have you!  Consequently you and I will probably be starting chemo about the same time so I will share with you lyrics from the one and only Michael Jackson, as follows: YOU ARE NOT ALONE, I AM HERE WITH YOU etc...! Calamtykel and Wherria: out going for a run!!!!!! Nice job, girls! JSW and Ladyinbama: Good point on the ACS campaign on more birthdays. That is why we are all doing this, right?! Rachel: I hope you get rid of that nervous twinge/twitch that developed while waiting for the bone scan results. Massage, I am only pretty sure, will take care of that. Everyone.... Wherria brings up a good point about my moniker. Part of it is that this has become my mantra and part of it is just plain silliness! More importantly, however, is I am a bit of a type A and my **BIGGGEST** fear was getting cancer. I am not joking when I tell you this was it...the worst thing that could happen because I just could not bear the thought something would be in my body, that which I could not control, threatening my life and potentially duplicating more rapidly than it could be controlled. All I ever thought was I could NEVER live with this kind of a dx. Guess what?! What you fear MOST can meet you ½ way! So here it is, the scariest moment of my life, the thing I feared most I no longer fear. It is no longer scary and no longer do I feel I could not live in my own skin with it. Sure I am vulnerable and I have my pissed-off-at-the-world days like Friday but overall, when the thing you feared most in this world hits you right between the eyes, your fear has been assassinated. For these reasons I chose \"fearless leader\" because my biggest fear has been completely eradicated. I have always been a little on the strong side, too, so that is another reason for my name. Also, never once am I supporting you all and secretly suffering; when I am down, I share it and when I know you all need a little boost or some happy news, I try to be there. It is always from support and caring that I greet you all and never for any other reason. I do get upset and when I do, I will gladly share it and I do. Going forward, I will probably not have too many meltdowns and when I do I will let you know but, as always, I will remain......Your FEARLESS Leader!",

Gingerbrew: I am so sorry your DH travel schedule starts up again just when your MIL leaves. So many of us live by the corporate dictate and I can only imagine he has to get back to work. Plus, as I have been in business for years, the post-Labor Day few weeks is necessary to get ramped up for the all-important final quarter of the year. I know it is no less easy on you, however. You still have your granddaughter celebrating her 1 month birthday!!!!!! You also have us! Lisaattheshore: don't go hunting up conspiracies on that link!!!! You must refrain! Sweeney: what a nice Saturday morning! I remember watching the \"Super Heroes\" every Saturday morning. I loved it! In any case, that is a nice way to spend your morning. Karen09: so nice of you to stop by!!!!! Your hair looks great!!!! It was very nice of you to share your story. Stop in and tell us more inspirational stuff any time ;) Ann97: on a long list of things you never thought you would utter is \"I am glad it is a stomach bug!\" I am very happy it was a stomach bug and am glad you are doing ok. My TE is definitely ruptured. Oh well...it will go flat and will be puffed up again next year! Focusing on dates is great. I already put something in my office and on the refrigerator that says: 1 down, 5 to go! Of course that will be applicable on Weds but I am just saying....! Ladyinbama: thanks for the link. So he did do it but it was not all of the time. I saw the Stones twice in the past decade and one was in Hartford, CT. Mick was out on this staging that was set up like a square outline from the stage. He was jumping around and singing when sure enough, Keith fell off of the stool he was (artificially!) propped up on and fell on the floor. The whole audience went silent...surely we thought he had died! They propped him back up again, went back to playing and there he goes on the floor again! I think the blood process, pre-concert, was a very good idea!!!!! Also I never put organ donor on my license because, as much as I would like to do it, there are such egregious pockets of wealth and power on the \"Gold Coast\" in CT (Fairfield County) I figured if I was in an accident, hanging on by a thread, and some wealthy old joker needed an organ to stay around a little longer, I would be considered expendable so I never did it!!!!!!! Lisaattheshore...you reading that little diddy?!?!?! Wherria: good to hear from you. I am glad you took the time to post and let us all know where you are at. My best wishes to you in any challenges that lie ahead and certainly for a good weekend ;) Please keep in touch...we miss you. Sohardbnme: Perhaps you can take yourself to lunch after shopping?! I would buy something you plan to wear next summer when everything is OVER and plan to look your very best on your next birthday. If I were you, I would celebrate next year's birthday this year and make plans for that day...good plans...a massage, dinner with your loveliest (!), mani/pedi, your hair done etc... make plans for next year! That is my birthday suggestion to you! Beau: I really think your oncs, assuming you are domestically situated, will know best and like Lisa said, and my nurse drove this home on Friday during chemo teaching, they monitor constantly during chemo and they know what to look for. Do you have confidence in your docs? I would never think of asking for a 10% reduction but that is also because I trust my onc implicitly. When in doubt don't, however, and I am pretty sure if you tell them you feel better with a 10% reduction they will do it. I never heard of someone doing that but what do I know?! Adey: are you having TAC? I start Tuesday on it so we can path together on this if I only you, too, were having TAC?!?? Please do share! Calamtykel: I know your tale of getting your port placed in Kabul, I mean Newark (!), should not be funny but it is the way you describe it and perhaps I have a macabre sense of humor...so be it!! It really does sound like you went to Kabul, btw! The funniest part of the last post? When you quite innocently request percocet!!!!!!!!!! Funny, funny stuff!! \u2018Hi...can I get some percs for the road...so I am calm my nerves enough so I don't \"s\" my pants trying to get back to my car!!' Yes, I am finished!! JSW: college day football...good stuff!!!!!!! I plan to watch more football this year...way more football! I am really into baseball but not so much football but as I deeply suspect I will have way more time on my hands this football season (score this with the music from Springsteen's Jungleland: down in chemo land!) I will be watching me some football! 9/11: I did not go to ground zero. I plan to go next year. With chemo starting Tuesday I did not think it was such a good idea as I go to pieces when I am down there. I am very, very impressed with the progress being made on rebuilding WTC plaza as of late. It is starting to really starting to take shape. I have fun imagining what it will look like when it is done. It is so important to me mentally that they filled that gaping chasm that was the former WTC plaza. I am just happy to see those buildings go up. THANKS ALL for your wishes today. I am ok...with my deflated foob!! It is beautiful in CT today. I think I will get out for some very fresh air! Good day chemo-sabis!!!!! Your FEARLESS Leader",

The next time anyone feels they are NOT getting a hard time at work when they need time off for cancer treatment etc... don't think it is because your company/boss/supervisor loves you but rather because they are well-versed in the caliber of laws that protect you.   We, as cancer patients, owe a debt of gratitude to George W.

I still think Gaila FREE is super better than $2 but whatever you guys want to do!!!!!!!!!!! ",

Joking...! So far, so good.  Today I am going to pull my hair!!!!!  Just because I know these could well be the final days of none coming out in my fist! Lisaattheshore: no, these are not the correct \"juice\" to enhance lifting!  Funny if they were, however!    Like ckptry said, some docs don't feel shaving is a problem but my BS said don't shave under that arm.  The other night on my roid bonanza at Walmart I bought clippers to shave my head and an electric razor for under the left arm as I don't want to use my boyfriends anymore!  He gets comfortable if I allow him to keep stuff here!  he he he!  I did not use it yet but you can get a decent one for under $40 and there was a narrow one also.  I got the clippers for $20 to buzz my head when, and if I am not so lucky as Lisaattheshore, it starts coming out!!! Omaz: good info on the water.  I asked that yesterday.  I, too, was told the roughly 80 ozs I drink per day is enough.  I am going to up that to 100 anyway but I guess the 120 on a gallon is not good.  If you drink coffee or tea in the AM, and use half-and-half which actually has protein and hardly a trace of sugar, and do not use sugar in your coffee or tea, that does count as water consumption also, don't forget. Y'all: I worked for a brokerage firm that was HQ'd in Atlanta. I picked up y'all from them and it never left my vernacular!   So far so good with me but this is quite premature.  Friday through Monday will be the test, as I have been warned of days 4-8 and/or 7-10.  I remain, as always, cautiously optimistic!!!!!!!  I give Greenspan credit for linking these 2 words!  He was such a clever man!  One morning on the 4/5 (yes, our Fed Chairman was known to ride the subway a time or 2!) my friend spilled hot coffee on his head!  He was sitting and she was standing and was quite tall in the near 6' range and ooooooooops!  Sorry Mr. Chairman!!!!  Sadly she did not even know who he was...ugh!  On a NY train in the morning, one can easily hide! Wherria: out in the patchwork blanket I refer to when I fly West!   Question on Neulasta: I am going to take it tomorrow before LGFB.  I am wondering how soon it does hit? I will get it probably around 10:45 and will be having LGFB from 11.  How soon do you feel it's effects (or anyone that has some info) as I have been so looking forward to LGFB but won't be back home until probably 2.  Let me know and thanks.  Good day...glad you did your 3rd also, btw, and your SE's are negligible.   That is very, very good news, missy! I hope you all do one good thing for yourselves today!!!  Oh yeah, that SOHARDBNME must have had one heck of a birthday as we have failed to hear from her AT ALL!!  Maybe when she gets up this afternoon from her partying she will send us a message!

As for dedraggled MEAT, I can't stand red meat (saw the cow video in college!) but b/c my iron was low and having to eat more protein, I decided to eat a steak.  I will NEVER do that again.  If you are not a regular consumer of red meat the grotesque hormones in it will shock the system.   I don't hate the way red meat tastes but I despise the egregious industry surrounding and all those hormones are NOT just staying in the meat as it passes through your system.  I am not a vegan or a vegetarian but even yesterday I found out one of my diet staples is under the FDA gun: salmon.  Apparently lots of salmon being sold right here in the US is genetically manufactured.  This means there was never a fish involved!  It is worse than farming...it is a petri dish!!!!!!!  The FDA is currently deciding on requiring genetic salmon manufacturers to disclose that on their labels.  All I can think is great, just great!  I have to get protein in so I am doing what I always have which is nuts, cottage cheese and I do eat chicken and eggs.  So, in the end, they told me no red sauce and to eat tons of protein but I will go back to exactly what I did pre-chemo, until sauce makes me sick or what I am doing does not make sense, which is no red meat and I will still eat sauce!  I am on TAC x 6 with an accumulated response (lucky me!) so I am sure by the Nov/Dec stretch things like sauce might be off the menu but, for now, I will continue to enjoy my favorites!!!!  I am going to eat what I normally have until my system tells me otherwise. Good times, good stuff!   Ginger, take it easy on yourself-1 year from now this will be history...or herstory as it were!",

As for the show, I am so glad you felt strong enough to return.  I hate to sound like I am pointing out the obvious but chemo needs a rested body.  I hope you totally baby yourself in your down time.  Really, really, really take it more easy than you could ever imagine doing under any other circumstances.  I told you I worked in theater in my early 20's and I know the show must go on but I also know there will be other shows and you have a very good reason to take a break if you so chose.  The seriousness of the matter is no one wants to do chemo twice.  Just watch out for #1 and if you feel like taking a break don't also feel like you are giving up when, in fact, you are owning up to the idea that rest is an imperative and one of the main ingredients of successfully battling bc.  Just be sure you are getting all the rest you can during non-performance periods.  I wish you the best and hope that you continue to break a leg ;) ",

Speaking of hairdressers, I was with mine for *14* years and when this happened, she came to visit, told me how she would help and blah blah blah. I gave her my front door key to feed my cat while I had my bmx just in case I was gone longer than anticipated. Now, mind you, it is about $175 every time I go to her add that up over 14 years! In any case, my boyfriend said he would feed the cat but he lives 35 minutes away and what I was doing was breaking up tasks while I was hospitalized meaning I had 1 friend doing this, another doing something else, someone helped with shopping etc.. and I figured b/c she lives close, it would not be a big deal. After she left here that day, I called like 3 weeks later, as I never heard from her again, to confirm she would feed the cat. Her attitude was not so hot so I decided, about a week later, and after I was having nothing but trouble getting a copy of my front door key made at Lowe's, to call her and get the key back because I no longer felt comfortable so I left a message and emailed asking for the key back. Four weeks goes by, I am in and out of the hospital and not only did I not hear from her, she never returned the key. I finally sent her a text telling her to get that key back to me or I was going to the salon to tell her boss and to retrieve that key. I get the key back with some stupid letter stating she felt I was upset with her and like she was not sure if she had done something wrong. People are such gargantuan A-holes, I can't believe it. Not only will I never go to her again, I will not recommend that salon. After 14 years this classless sac did not even send me a get well card!! I am glad it is going to take 2.5-3 years before my hair is long again as I will have ample time to find a new, better hairdresser. Jokers!!! Ginger: I hope I can color it again. I like highlighting. I look like Uncle Fester after shaving it as I have 2 gray spots right in the Uncle Fester spots!! Of course, I had no idea they were there because I have been highlighting for YEARS! Yeah, on the candy thing, I *almost* went out to buy some and stopped long enough to remind myself that steroid monster is visiting next week and will have it's way with that candy so perhaps it is best to buy it on October 30th! Calamtykel: it is day 4 for me...in fact, it is more like days 4-8 but I will see what happens next week as tx #2 is Tuesday. Rest, relax, forget about life for a while! Be good to yourself. Ckptry: funny on the yogurt handprints! I will never forget one night at my sister's house, she has *6* kids(!), and they were having white rice! Well, Aunt Liz sort of incited a little food fight and sure enough, in no time flat, it looked like someone had gotten married in her kitchen!!!! She was not eating with us but was doing laundry and waiting to eat with her husband when he got home so I had some fun with the kids!!! I am going to pick up my Emend tomorrow. So not looking forward to Tuesday but alas we have NO choice. Bring on the carbs!!! Yummy! Well, girls: I have pretty much decided to go back to school for nursing. It will take a few years but I think it will be very worth it and I can work with people similarly situated. I have been thinking about it for years and now I will just do it.",

As for your friend visiting, I exercise a great economy of words with people. Everyone knows chemo is hard. This is why I am so glad we have each other because we do a lot of chatting here with others going through the same thing so we don't have to talk to others NOT in the know! I don't really think you have to say too much or explain at all. I have not had dry eyes and then watery eyes *yet!* It might also be geographical. For instance, I am in the humid, damp Northeast. If you are out West (I notice you are in AZ) the dry air might be bringing it on. Scary Vision Issue Day 4: I don't think I told any of you but I was so scared on day 4 when I went to the grocery store at night and my vision got blurry. I almost called my boyfriend to pick me up. I was able to drive home as the road is a straight shot, through a lake area, back to my house. THAT is a taxotere SE. Very scary. Zenith: I am fully aware the underlying cause is chemo but I just like to talk about it to make sure my other chemo friends are also having headaches! I also want to know if any of us can pinpoint triggers, which may be different for all of us anyway but, like Calamtykel noticed chocolate and onions were doing it for her. I just like to chat about it. HGTV: Mike Holmes is the greatest thing since flushable toilets! He is definitely doing God's work, man! He really helps so many people out. He seems to be a card-carrying member of a dying breed...that is for sure. Ckptry: Sorry to hear about your son. I am wondering how old he is because perhaps you can sneak it into fish sticks, tuna fish, sushi? Does he eat any of that? Perhaps you can get in him in a number of different ways...fishy ways so he can't taste it!! I know my sister struggled to get wheat germ in my nephew and finally she started putting it in cookies and brownies! I know fish oil won't go with those, however! Ginger: are you regularly taking Zyrtec or Claritin? My nurse told me that a lot of people take it right through the entire duration of chemo to help with the sniffles and cold/flu-like symptoms we all get. I get the sniffles and a little coughing. Are you considering wearing a mask in public when we move into the winter months? I am seriously considering it. I got a handful of those paper masks at the hospital. I am also going to go shopping as late in the evening or as early in the morning as possible to avoid any crowds. I am really going to do everything I can to protect myself through November and December when the cold and flu season hits. On the sleeping, 14 hours is a lot but your body must need it so sleep away, my friend! There is nothing wrong with sleeping J I remember one night I slept like 11 hours. Our bodies are going through tough times and we have to baby ourselves. On unpacking your sewing room, do one thing each day. Just one thing. Look around the room and start to conceptualize a finished product but don't put pressure on yourself to do it all at once. Just one little thing each day and you will slowly start to see it coming together. Congratulations on your incoming new craft machine! That sounds great. I watch some of the HGTV craft shows early, like 7AM, when, of course, I have gotten up early and then usually fall back to sleep! Elizabeth27: the wig is DEFINITELY giving me a headache. I am getting a headache more this past week, the week before my next chemo, so I really think mine is stress-induced. Home gym: I have been up since 6 so excited to set up my new treadmill!   I am so happy to have gotten a new one.   I also got a Gazelle and an Ab Lounger.   Now I have an Abdoer, a Weider double station pro with 450 lbs of stackable weights, treadmill, upright bike, recumbent bike, rebounder, 2 yoga balls, 10 workout discs, an aerobic step, 5, 10 and 15 lb free weights, a flat bench with an olympic bar and 100 lbs of plates and a stretching station.   I LOVE my home gym and I *force* myself to workout daily and to lift as my oncologist told me that is one of the only things I can do to combat fatigue. I don't want that fatigue taking over...it makes me nervous.  In any case, I don't do too much...maybe 20-30 minutes of cardio and some lifting...anything to stave off miserable fatigue!  Consequently I don't feel like I am necessarily winning the battle but I just might win the war!!! I hope you all are having a lovely weekend and remember to move out of the company of toxic people and smile while you are doing it!!! Good day, girls-",

I never had any?  Sniffles, runny nose...good times, chickie!  Are you shaving down to your scalp or buzzing?  If shaving to the scalp are you going to a salon or doing it at home?  I am considering a razor and an ex's shaving cream he left here!  TOnight in the shower all the little buzzed hair was falling out!  Soon I will have spots of hair and spots of scalp....sort of like a globe...perhaps I will do greens and blues!!!! Anyone else want to weigh in on the shaving the head issue?!  Did you all shave to the scalp, just buzz it and, if you did go to the scalp was it at home, electric or straight and what was your experience?  I think I am goign to have to go to the scalp later this week and personally am a little nervous after this guy at my job walked around with a band aid on his HEAD from shaving, as he did the bald thing (really hot but dumb as rocks!!!) and I don't want cuts on my head complicating my life! GI Jane: when all is said and done, this entire experience might have made a GI Jane out of me!  Now if only I could get my traps cut again!!!! Good night girls and good luck to ME, Wherria and Omaz as we are all getting treated to some luscious chemo tomorrow!!!!!  WOE IS US!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Ginger: it is really good that they put you on hold.   The last time, 55 days ago, when I saw my onc he did drive home the idea that even the slightest infection can turn very into a life threatening event.  Just go ahead and be grateful they stopped you before chemo debilitated you much further and you could have wound up in a much worse position.   Just be happy they stopped you.  I would be happy they decided not to treat.  There is always next week!!!   I know, if you could only get your hands on my neck (smile!!!). Adey:  All shaved up!!!!  Doesn't it feeling liberating!??!   I am really happy with my results.  Does anyone know what kind of brush we can use to take care of these wigs.  I got a super soft brush and strands are coming out in the brush.  I think this is what they told me to avoid.   In any case, any advice is appreciated.  The wig was almost $500 so this should NOT be happening. Ladyinbama:  I will be looking forward to the pic.  I emailed you my email.   Thanks so much for offering.   I guess I will just let the little whiskers go down the drain as they please!  I have a septic system though and I was worried about how all this hair, pre and post buzzing is affecting my system!  Oh well...perhaps I will find out at the next cleaning!!!! Alright, girls. I am hopeful someone will be calling me in soon as I am still in the waiting room for an 11 appointment.  This also means they have to thaw my med and I will be waiting some more.  I wish this was a slightly more expeditious process as you all know how  I feel about being in *that* room.   Oh well... alas there is nothign I can do",

I have not seen him in 2 months and, quite frankly, I think that is deplorable. I am going to ask to see another onc if he does another no-show today. By the time my next appointment comes around it will be 3 months since I have seen an oncologist. Calamtykel: I totally agree I should see him and, at the very least, more frequently. I am going to check with my insurance company to see if they are billing for onc appts because I am making co-payments when I arrive. I am a little pissed about this. It could be anything and certainly I need the opinion of someone other than the nurse. My BS is also in this Yale collective breast oncology department and she is on only 2 days. I will try to get an appointment with her in the next few weeks. I am also going to tell her I never see this guy and I want another doctor. I have a question about the cold: what number tx are you on and how long have you had a cold? Just wondering. I am getting a bit of the coughing and I am also worried because I have the propensity to get bronchitis. I get it approximately once every 3 years. I blame that largely on the fact that people at my job, which you all have heard me complain before (!), use up all the sick time by the 3rd quarter and my job is ultra-strict about attendance so they have no choice but to come in sick. I do get weekly bloodwork but it was only platelets. I asked them to start doing glucose and thyroid as well. Do you have Emla at home? Can't you use that before bloodwork? That is a shame. I either did not know or failed to remember you had phlebitis in your arm. Sorry to hear that, Kel. That sux. I also know it is probably inconvenient to go get the liver and kidney checked but it just might be a good idea. Just think, an earlier mammogram catching this BEAST could have saved you a lot of time and trouble so perhaps getting the liver and kidney checked is really not a bad idea. If something is going on it is probably just as well that you catch it as soon as possible. Oh girls....better times, they are a comin'!  I have to say, though, I am so very grateful for this group because at least I know 99% of you (I am the 1%) see your onc each time so it helps me a lot to know what to expect.   I think this group has been so wonderful and supportive.  It is not just the thread but the caliber of people here.  It is such a nice experience so I thank you all for making it a special place. Don't forget to smile at yourself in the mirror...it works! 　",

I agree with everyone about how so many have disappeared as our battle with bc drags on.   I think Kel was right with the idea that people just automatically think we are in a routine or we have all the support we need.  It does hurt but I figure, most unfortunately, some day they too will be similarly situated with some issue and they will find out what it is like when people disappear.  As for me, with jackasses visiting with colds, I am perfectly to keep people at bay but I, too, have had the same experience as you all have had with the support system waning.  We have each other so thanks for the www! Omaz: excellent link about exercise.  It is the best thing we can do for ourselves.  For those that don't like to exercise, per se, pilates is both challenging and low impact.  Something to consider. Good day to everyone.  I hope you are enjoying this nice Fall day-",

As for the news, cancer is a part of us and even those undiagnosed, as we all know, are making the cells every day. \"Our\" bodies and these meds have combined to become cancer cell killing machines. Look to #6 and starting rads. I think your attitude is great and that will only benefit you. I say look to the best possible outcome. They monitor you more closely than me but I don't know where this stuff is at now?! Who knows! My last scan was before chemo was started. Look to the future, Tex with your great spirit and I send you the best vibes and thoughts every day. Also, no FB and nut job relatives! You are hereby on a steady diet of avoiding those 2 things!!! Lisa: great photos! I like you with and without fur! You are going to kill me after Lago but I think you look like a much younger Joy Behar with your red locks! I am serious...you remind me of her. The shot on the tracks is riddled with defiance. I really think that says something in particular about the fight we are all in. They are photos and statements as well. Thanks for sharing. Sohardbnme: Just a few days ago I was thinking of asking everyone if they had good chronological records of what has occurred to date. I promised myself I would make better notes and keep track but I failed to do so. I mean I can piece it together but I have to say, you have done a fine job. Now let me tell you why I was thinking about all of this: when I first found bc.org I was pm'ing with a long, long time member. She gave me wonderful advice and great tricks etc... but there were times she admitted she had gone through this all so long ago and that she just could not remember. She was so wonderful and supportive and I appreciated everything she told me.  It was through that experience I decided, as a means to be able to quickly reference my records and help others yet to join us in this battle, I would keep contemporaneous notes. I think you have done a wonderful job doing what I was supposed to! I wish you the best on the next steps that lie ahead for you. Sptmm: Yes, one voice can make a difference. Apparently the new President of Yale Hospital has earned herself a reputation for responding, with vigor, to complaints. Quite frankly if the guards were not behaving in such an egregious manner, I probably would not have written but they were just out of control. As for you, I am really happy for your progress and you seem like you are in such a better place these days than the spread-thin, work-o-rama, struggle through chemo madness that engulfed you just a few short months ago. I am so glad that is behind you. Welcome to the new frontier! Ginger: don't ever apologize for discussing your pain. Not here anyway. We are here for you....and the lights in your slippers! That is a very funny, albeit moderately sad, example of this neuropathy business but, as they say, if we don't laugh...! Elimidate and you were not a believer?!? Did I miss something?!?! I am so happy to hear you did not need pain meds today. That is liberating. I hope you have a good #7 next week and certainly a small space in time here where you can enjoy a few pleasant days before that next tx. Omaz: How are you doing? I hope things are ok for you. Nails turning black: Sadly, one of the SE of TAC is finger and toenails turning black! Mine are starting....I am hoping to get through the next 2 without losing my nails. BC and chemo combined are truly the gifts that just keep giving...and giving....and giving! I am doing a fine job of sleeping off chemo again. I just got up about 1 hour again from my post-neulasta shot and subsequent trip to DSW...a girl needs shoes!!!!!! Oh yeah...went to Whole Foods as well looking for their pretty, colorful reusable bags and all they had were some with pumpkins on them....not happy! I purchased them anyway! Flu shots: has anyone been offered or had one? I have never had one in my life and with 2 txs left, I really don't want to have one. They were sort of strongly encouraging me on Tuesday but I was able to politely decline in the chemo center. How do you all feel about them? Have you had one? How did you feel after? Just wondering... As always, happy trails to you all. May the force be with you!!!",

To all: I am going to start our list of who is having chemo and what day this weekend.  For those who have responded already, I will list you.   If, however, you don't have information and/or join us later, I will add you then I have a question for everyone: I have an infection so I don't even know my own start date as I am on 1500 mgs of Cipro right now to clear a fluid infection in the affected breast.  Now I also had tickets to Maroon 5 next weekend but I am giving those up as well as Ozzfest tickets AND I did not go to a weekend event in Philly that I look forward to all year all because I want to maintain and preserve my health.  I mean, god forbid something happened to me and I broke my leg or got cut by broken glass etc... who knows what could happen and what kind of effect that could potentially have on my chemo start date.   I am not getting unnecessarily worried but I do feel, albeit a trying time, that I want to get over this infection and get started on chemo ASAP.  If, however, I am ok with chemo then I will do more things but only once I am on it.   Has anyone altered plans or changed anything because of wanting to stay in top health before/during chemo?  Share your thoughts becuase seriously I knew I had to give up OzzFest tickets but Maroon 5 breaks my heart.  I am trying to be safe.",

Wherria: Your case is a bit anomalous but there are so many variations on this disease. The lymphatic system, as I am sure you know, is simply a filter to fight off and rid our system of things that do not belong. Now, having said that, each node does not have infinite capacity to do every job. As you already have an immune system challenge (s), it is entirely feasible when your body picked up these cancer cells and knew they had to be dealt with, they were just carried to the next available worker to deal with, much like the next available teller gets the next customer. The lymph node where they landed was the one that was available to do the job at that point. Nodes come in chains because they share jobs. If one node could do all jobs, we would only have one. It is a chain of industrious pebbles trying to keep us out of harm's way. In any case, I am very, very sorry your dog is sick!!!!! That is a lot for your to be dealing with alone so, as you very well know, you are not alone and post all you want so you feel connected during this time of DH traveling and doggy sickness! BTW, do you know your start date or did I miss it? Just like to make sure everyone is included. Zenith: things do seem to be happening fast but at least you are closer to getting it ALL over with so that is the silver lining. If it was being dragged out it could be more frustrating. I have an issue with claustrophobia and after going through 9/11, I also have an issue with flying as a result of both of my afflictions. More to this point, however, is I don't like closed MRI's and, based on your report, I probably would not take well to this mugga test either so I feel for you. We are all in it together so keep us posted on your entire experience so we can share it with you and be supportive. Michelle1014: How are you doing? Looking forward to an update and hoping your first week after your first treatment has been a breeze (smile!). Update on the list I created: The format I created is driving me bananas!!!!!! I am going to try to make a chart this weekend with just your screen name, start date and type. There are limitations in this system relative to cut-n-past charting so let me see what I can do with this. For now I very much feel I have created a discombobulated eye sore! I will fix it, girls (and husbands!), I promise!  Also, please, if I ever miss anyone just PM me or post on the board and I will fix it.   Have a nice weekend all- Liz",

From what I understand, the major SE's of chemo are fatigue and loss of appetite due to how chemo affects taste buds but they have to give us full and fair disclosure; that is the legal, be it CYA, part.  Liz",

Zachsmom: YES on the muscular and bald look!  I used to body build, not competitively or too \"juicy\" but definitely to keep a nice infrastructure and I totally wish my traps still looked like they did then because with a powerful, but slender, neck and well-defined traps, bald would look fab!  In any case, I lament the (not entire) loss of my well-defined traps but they sure aren't like they were!  Plus, it is summer.  Who cares about being bald?!  I think it will be fun and I am saving a boat load of cash on avoiding highlight sessions since dx!   Saved about $600+ so far (this is Connecticut!).  BTW, I also had 4 drains and the recumbent bike, albeit boring, is a good option.  I rode with all four drains in.   I know what you mean also about feeling pent-up, waiting to be realeased to workout.  I was not released, per se, but I just do what I want anyway!   I like working out. To all the runners: we are bound on this thread b/c of chemo but I don't know if you all had mx or bmx but I worked and lived in Manhattan, I used to run Central Park a few mornings with a friend and those FAT SACKS that I bid farewell (little gift from bc) I would have to TAPE DOWN and wear a sports bra!  I don't miss it and if any of you runners had mx or bmx please share how you feel now!  I was a DD/E going into surgery and am soo grateful for small breasts that will no longer move but I really like working my pecs....alas everything is a trade-off,,,yeah....like I had a choice!!!!!! Working out: I rode my recumbent bike 2 days after my bmx and still use my home gym but I just don't do any chest exercises.  It is so healthy and probably the best we can all do right now.  I used to teach Step aerobics and I just set my step up, with cushioned floor, in my basement and dragged out the old Reebok and Jane Fonda tapes!   I have an old tv w/a built-in VCR that still works and I am happy to have it!  I find also that I did not want to go far from home so I just stay right in my neighborhood when I power walk.   I just don't want to get feeling not so good too far from home!  I am like reverting to the womb under these new circumstances I find myself in! Keep working out because those endorphins cause us to smile and you know what I say about smiling!!!!!!!!!!  BTW, on the Michael J Fox quote: it really comes down to 'you can't control what happens so the only thing you can control is your reaction to it.'   It is 1/2 art, 1/2 science and a gallon of wine!!!",

      "Content": "Aug 5, 2010 03:09AM - edited Aug 5, 2010 03:18AM by 1WonderWoman I just wanted to remind you all when I started this thread I knew this was not going to be the easiest road for some of us but I felt it necessary to bring us together. There is going to be laughter and tears and feelings of frustration, upset, pity, joy, a sense of triumph and the pendulum shall swing. I fully embrace that and I encourage everyone, everyday to come here and share. I just want us to remember the great words of FDR, as follows: the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. Try not to get yourself worried sick before things have started based on the deluge of information we get, albeit the preponderance of it is enough to make you have to change your underwear(!!!!!), and please try to focus on the fact that our choices, sadly, are very, very few at this point. If you were afraid of flying and you knew you HAD to fly, would you spend the days prior to flying reading every article about every crash and every bad thing that ever happened when flying? Of course not and, quite frankly, my BIL is alive some 10 years after being dx'd with lung cancer and that is thanks to surgery and chemo. Try to find the positive stories about chemo and hang onto those because negativity and fear only beget more negativity and fear. Try to think positive...just try it...you might be pleasantly surprised! &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& Justduit: congratulations on making the correct choice for you because without a modicum of clairvoyance, I too chose bmx. The other breast was clean for me but for how long?! I did not need another terrorist hotel hanging off of my chest as I assigned cancer the voice of Cheech from \"Cheech and Chong\" and it goes something like \"hey, we are running low on room in this hotel...do you have another one for us (this is the voice of the cancer cells in my body high on their take-over!)?\" Sure I do...I have another nice, big fat hotel over here on the right for you all...make yourselves comfortable and don't forget to hide on mammo day!!!!! I have to make this fun...there is no alternative. So, in the end, welcome to our glamorous club!!!! BTW, I am on the cyto/taxotere train as well and I am no MD but I certainly think your onc is correct for you to have chemo. I will try this as fun as possible for you as I think we will be starting the same day!   Sohard: we will all be feeling weird with you. There is nothing odd about feeling weird on chemo but come back and keep sharing and we will support you every step of the way. English: I know you started and am curious as to how you are feeling? We have only just begun and I think, as a way of celebrating we have only just begun our new lives when we are all done with chemo, is celebrate with a trip to Disney in February where we can really celebrate new fur, no more chemo, having enjoyed the holidays and our refreshed lives! Not to mention acting like children for a few days!!! I hope you are doing well. Wherria: I am glad you went for a peaceful run in the park when you awoke at 5AM and a mile is a lot based on the hour and what you are going through! What I love is our collective spirit as it comes together and grows. We are all pretty committed to not letting this get us down even if on a bad day it just means walking around your property. We will redefine this fight and get through it together. I hope your lower back is feeling better, the neulasta shot is helping and good news on that store you found! Hang in there, chicklett (!), we are going to be ok ;) Jsw: glad to hear from you! I know the nausea etc.. might be a problem but it is not going to go on forever and it is also a very good sign that your body is trying to get rid of something it does not want. Overall it is uncomfortable but it is healthy nonetheless so fear not! I loaded up on Boost yesterday. I bought like 15-6 packs because I do suspect there are going to be days when my stomach asks me, as it manages the chemo in my body, to not give it additional work for the day! Keep posting and let us know what is going on. BTW, that is so cool that you knit your own hats! I am not crafty, I can't sew and I can barely cook but I can trade stocks pretty handily! I guess we all have our blessings!! Lisaattheshore: welcome! Nice to have you join us! This is the \"Cheers\" of cancer bars! It is just nice to come to a place where everyone knows your name! Best of luck- Adey: welcome and love the avatar! Beautiful. Ladyinbama: I am really glad you had a fun day shopping! Make it fun...enjoy it...like my friend said he is going to he is going to shave his head as a show of solidarity and then we can go out as Coneheads for Halloween!!!!! Let's have fun with it! Sohard and Zenith: sorry you two had challenges with the port insertion and SE's of that process. I will let you know after I get mine what my story is! Carol0371: Four times is a lot but thank you just the same for joining us. It is a little hard to accept this is the path to a better life, certainly on time #4, but you have to hold onto that, if for nothing else, solace. Don't forget, sneaky cancer was trying to kill us and it will continue as that is all it knows until chemo comes in to do it's rendition of \"cancer interrupted!\" Sorry you have had to go through this so many times; it makes me wonder a bit about your oncs but you have to have faith. Best wishes to you, my friend. English: you make a good point in that the best thing we get from each other is how each of us responds to the SE's and what we do to manage them. Very good point and that is one of the major goals of creating this thread so thank you. StCards: thanks for your continued support and your wisdom as you have already gone down this path. I appreciate it and day 18 sounds about right on the shaving...I am still ambivalent on how I will proceed. I think once I get a date I will decide and I am a weirdo as I am looking forward to being bald!!!!!!  It is something new for me and I am going to have fun with the hats and scarves!  Some of the scarves are beautiful.  One question: how long for your lashes and brows to come back? Alicejean: welcome to our club! Nice of you to join us. Keep on coming back! Calamtykel: going from IIb to IIa is actually good news so good for you! As the date approaches it gets more real so I encourage everyone to focus on the fact that we are all finishing up JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS so let's be happy we are starting now! Gin2ca: I am welcoming you as a member and will put you on our list. We have a few late July starts who have joined us. Congratulations as you are in the process of getting better and putting this behind you. Mstina1976: Nice to have you with us! This, too, shall pass! Keep us posted and I will put you on the TBA list. Lisasinglem: thank you so much for reminding us that every step you have taken on this journey was worse in your head than in actuality. Those are words to live by. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& I am so grateful for all the participation and our new members! This is wonderful and it is just growing in the most positive manner every day so I thank you all so much for joining us and helping each other through this. It is absolutely amazing how much strength we will all find in each other going forward. Welcome one and all and we should give a big thanks to Wherria for posting the nccn.org website. That was very useful information if we want to get more insight into our dx and what treatments are usually recommended. This was a very necessary mid-week update! That is all, that is all! Happy trails, girls! Liz",

I was bananas on that bike thinking I was going to blow up after all I had accomplished and the shape I was in and the speed I was running and rollerblading at and i was MAD!   What I learned is I did not blow up, it did not take me too long to get back to my pre-injury pace and it probably gave my body a much-needed rest as I was working myself pretty hard at that time.   Just walk a little slower and a little longer and, this is for everyone: keep on the water, over 100 ozs per day during chemo.  It is very good for you anyway but it definitely helps expodite moving chemo to where it needs to go and then show it the door!!!!!!!   Remember we need to flush here!  Green tea and granny smith apples will get the natural process going also!

In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds, and shall find, me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll. I am the master of my fate:. I am the captain of my soul. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& This poem, along with the Gettysburg Address(!), I know by heart.  I find the very words are so liberating.  I think we all need to learn and celebrate this poem as our collective anthem and live it every day YOUR FEARLESS LEADER",

I, for one, am totally enjoying my savings from no highlighting (saved about $700 since dx!), no expensive shampoo (bought some stuff b/c I liked the price of $2 and the way it smelled!!!) which would normally cost me $50 a clip and now, this weekend, I am going to get one of those \"self highlighting kits\" and totally experiment/ruin my fur before I comes out!!!!!  As a young woman I never, ever did any experimenting with colors etc.. so it is going to be fun to just open the box and let it rip!!!!!!!  I encourage you all to totally mess up your fur with any experiments you NEVER did because you were afraid of the results as it is coming out anyway so have some fun!!!!!!!!  I can't wait to see the results! In the end, however, fur-talk aside, I am sorry we all qualify to be on this thread...so let's make the most of it!!!!!

I think I am going to get a kindle but I do have a library of books and I want to keep on building on that. I am not sure if I am going to love \"not\" buying/receiving books anymore or having to buy 2 versions, electronic and antiquated (!), of each book...time will tell! On the protein shakes, if your daughter is not doing it for weight loss but just looking to derive additional amino acids as a catalyst to build muscles I would suggest a GNC chocolate (or vanilla) protein powder and to sweeten it: baby food (Gerber) bananas; an actual banana; Hershey syrup (personal fav!) and in the summer a fudgcicle! If she likes bananas, those Gerber bananas add just the right amount of \"sweet\" kick to a protein shake! Funny the difference between young and old: at my age the \"chocolate\" protein drink itself is a treat!!! Also, if when you get out of the gym from lifting and you want something sweet, grab yourself some Gerber bananas as well...yum! I don't know if I will actually get any scholarships but I am applying just the same. I will see. It would help after all as I am going on being out of work almost a year now. As for scholarships, I really hope your daughter gets one. That would be so great. I hope your test results are fine.  It is natural to worry.  As for finding more cancer, I personally (imo) think that a IIb bc (in my case) is sort of like waiting to find it somewhere else. I will totally not be surprised at all by mets. I don't welcome it but I won't be devastated either. In fact, I have been getting a pain under my right rib: GP says might be cartilage; onc people say it might be stomach; I think it is liver mets! Even with mets, cancer is treatable and you can still live for several more years. Like I said before, cancer is a lifelong disease. 10-11 hours per day....reminds me of my Wall St days....no less than 12 hours per day but I loved it! Those were good times! Texas: Fiona Apple is another one of my favorites! She has got some pipes. That first album I think she locked herself in a hotel room in NYC for 2 weeks and wrote it...amazing! \"Uninvited\" is a great song. It is basically about 2 people who have met their match. Omaz: that game would be a huge seller..... with us! JSW: hot on the eyebrows!!!! Nice look! Congrats on knocking back some of those rads! Lisa: congrats on the show! That is so great. I will never forget what a trooper you were when you were trying so desperately to maintain your commitment to your work and going through chemo. Now you are definitely back! The VNA complimented me on my lush fur this morning! She remarked how it is coming in and coming thick also...glad for that. In the few years leading up to my cancer dx, my hair seemed to be thinning. I even remember losing more in the shower than ever and mentioning it to my hairdresser. I don't know if the bc was making my hair fall out but it was definitely thinning. It is nice to get a fresh start with some nice regrowth. My nephew had shaved his head to show solidarity and our hair is now growing back together! Of course, he looks much cuter with no hair and is a really good baseball pitcher at the young age of 12 so the whole look works for him a bit more! Happy trails, all-",

On the GNC powder, don't be surprised that it is kind of expensive.  It is a powder and a big jug of it is like $60.  I don't know if they have any single serving sizes.   I think you should get as small a container of powder as possible and have her blend it with milk and a banana.  She might like that.  If she likes sweet stuff, maybe she can just add a little sugar!

When I was looking further into some of what you wrote, I stumbled on this little nugget!  Now I know why they are called aromatase inhibitors, as follows: Estradiol, like other steroids, is derived from cholesterol. After side chain cleavage and utilizing the delta-5 pathway or the delta-4 pathway, androstenedione is the key intermediary. A fraction of the androstenedione is converted to testosterone, which in turn undergoes conversion to estradiol by an enzyme called aromatase. In an alternative pathway, androstenedione is aromatized to estrone, which is subsequently converted to estradiol. Estradiol is also a sex hormone....no wonder the feeling is gone! It is interesting about the tissue testing and certainly $100 seems to be a nominal amount of money and well spent at that based on the invaluable information that could be uncovered. I never heard anything about the PH state of the body. Never once. That is also very interesting. Does this mean that we should be testing our bodies regularly, even perhaps weekly, to see that our alkaline is not out of a healthy range? I am going to look into that more. Living in CT, home of Lyme, it is nice to know that some doctors are aware and of the 4 different species of lyme disease. Connecticut is a mess with lyme disease and in Fairfield County (the deer know where to eat!) it is a real problem. A few years back I wrote a proposal to the DOT and cc'd the Governor about a way to deal with some of this through a municipal underwriting. They were not interested. Do you know there is no formal plan for dealing with deer carcass in NY or CT? For this reason deer canabalise each other inadvertently. When the deer hits a certain point of deterioration the other deer can't tell it was once a deer and they dine on it. It is awful. On the tamox, a lot of people take 10 mgs in the morning and 10 at night. Did you try that? There are some herbs that have a deleterious relationship with tamox. You should look into that as well. The study where progesterone inhibited proliferation of the T47-D and sent them into apoptosis was very interesting. I guess to have a PR+ bc means if your bc cells accept progesterone, then progesterone gets in and send bc cells into aptosis. The cells open their doors to their demise! Beautiful! In any case, it is all very interesting and I wish you the best going forward with this osteopath. You really should research what herbs tamox interacts with negatively to see if you are taking something that was inadvertently causing you trouble when combined with tamox. The osteopath sounds great, though. Good for you! LADY:  glad you are doing well!  Great to hear from you.   Glad you are home. Well, time to do the crossword! - Liz",

I am going to have to go to the doc but I am going to wait another day or 2 and see if my body can fight it off. Oh well...could be worse! At least the weather is getting nicer! JSW: congrats on being nearly done with rads...almost there! As for cycles, no sign of any of that here. No pains, no bloating etc... Oh well...perhaps it is gone for good! OMG...funny story: I was in a meeting a few nights ago and I was having hot flashes. I was fanning myself with some of the literature I was given. The woman conducting the meeting asked me if I was ok etc... and I explained hot flashes and I will be fine. She then remarked I look way too young for hot flashes and I responded \"very long story\" so she moved right along! Of course, I was wearing a tank top and the humongous dressing for the hole that I have to pack where my left boob used to be showed...I think everyone started coming to their own conclusions! Ginger: young hippie here! Seriously...my stepsister and I besieged my father to take us to get those moccasins back in high school! For a while those and Timberland boots were in! So weird! I cannot believe I wore those and actually walked in them...there is ZERO support!!!! I also wore these sneakers called \"Balloons\" which could be purchased at a shoe store called \"Thom McCan\" or something to that effect. In any case, again, zero support. I am so glad your scare was just a \"scare.\" Very good news. Now the bad news is that stomach virus/food poisoning you are suffering with. I hope you and your DH are feeling better and forbid it is a virus and your poor visitor gets it and for this reason I hope it was food poisoning. Teva makes great shoes. I have had a few pairs over the years and an orthopedist put me on to them years ago. As for the numbness, sorry that is still there but the pain being gone is always nice. I am pretty numb on the outside of my right thigh. I don't know if that was chemo or something else and I don't have diabetes so it is definitely not the very common diabetic neuropathy. I realized it just a few nights ago when while minding my business eating salmon at the bistro table in my kitchen, my little cat Bibbers was busy trying to get my attention and she was giving me little claw taps to the leg with her double paws! I did not feel it so much and realized later, somehow and someway, I am somewhat numb in that leg. To hell with it I say because there is NO way I am going to go asking questions about that now! Forget it! I cannot deal with any more new stuff/new docs/new dxs period. Not for a while. Ckptry: how are you feeling these days? I hope you are feeling better. I also think, and to condition yourself, you should ask one thing of one person each week to condition yourself for accepting help. It is like any other kind of training, after all! Tex: CONGRATS on being done with rads! Also very nice that you can now get compliments on your short hair and no more stares of sympathy! Adey: now I remember...you got Frankenhusband shape-ups, right?! I was not familiar with MBTs although I will check them out. How are you feeling these days? Getting used to tamox? Omaz: how is it going? Is the dosage, taken once daily, seeming to help? I spoke with the APRN yesterday about hot flashes. She said a mild antidepressant might help. I am going to consider it b/c those hot flashes are keeping me up all night. A masticating juicer, I think, is necessary with things like Kale. The other option is to use a traditional blender and chop it very fine. Masticating juicer = much easier! Kel: good luck and I hope you do find someone creative enough to give you options. I just think that is the very least we can expect of these docs. Well, I hope you all are enjoying some Spring weather and being good to yourselves. If I was not sick, I was going for my first facial in months on Friday. I am only pretty sure I will be rescheduling! Good day-",

They promised sun here and they were a little wrong but at least we got 65 degrees! I must say last night I was very happy to hear Osama was gone. He killed my boyfriend, countless friends and acquaintances, made me move back to CT basically out of fear and affected my business tremendously. I am very glad he is gone. I am also glad, at least in part, our soldiers can come home from Afghanistan. It was odd that I was so relieved. My first job as a broker was in WTC and I also worked in WFC for Lehman Brothers. I loved the entire financial plaza downtown and that entire event took a huge toll on me both mentally and emotionally. I have pics from the day after 9/11 of the ruins that once were the towers. My greatest memories in life were working on Wall St and my love of the financial industry and the whole experience and essence downtown. I missed it so much when I moved back to CT although I was still working in NY. I was just afraid to live there anymore. I missed my boyfriend so much and was having quija board sayonces trying to contact him! The only I made contact was a wine bottle! That rented so much space in my head, it was awful. In any case, I will be in NY this weekend and will be taking updated photos of ground zero. I will share if anyone is interested. I miss the towers and I miss my life as it once was. In long, and again, I am really glad he is gone and they buried him at sea so no martyrdome could get started. Schie2011: welcome! There is so much to expect but I would not want to scare you with caveats. Everyone is different. As things happen, come here and talk about them. We will support you through it but don't want to mismanage your expectations with telling you things that perhaps you will never come to experience. I had 6 rounds of TAC. Just stop in if you are feeling something and talk with us. Again, I hate to tell you a bunch of stuff that, hopefully, will never come to pass for you. In long, we are here for you! Best of luck. Omaz- my wound is gross, thanks for asking! I got it cultured last week...we will see. I am so looking forward to getting this leftover TE out, a TE in the wound (!), and final implants. By the time they take the other TE out it will have been in over a year. I hope you are having a nice day out in the desert! Nice heat. It is still chilly here...like barely 60 today but it is much nicer than the 40's we were having up until recently! Sptmm: I am glad you had a nice day upstate NY. I was just remembering last night one year I flew to FL, purposely went into Orlando because I wanted to jump on a few rides at Disney, got in the rental and drove to Sarasota to see mom, Naples to see my brother and then flew out of Tampa. It was such a beautiful, hot, hot summer week! I remember driving along, crossing the Sunshine bridge thinking I love this incredible heat! All along while I was in NY I was lamenting going to FL in the summer because of the oppressive heat but when I got there, I decided it felt nice to be really warm! FL to LI...big change for you! I so look forward to retiring in FL. Nice, incredible heat! JSW: congrats on finishing rads... so nice to get this stuff behind us. Calamtykel: Really? The brand was no good on Vit D? That is awful. I am glad you went and got a better quality. I was wondering when I first started reading how you could be low on Vit D and still taking a lot? Don't worry about the WBCs just yet. One year on those as well. I don't know how the heck I got bronchitis but it cannot mean my WBCs are back to where they should be either. I just looked at my most recent bloodwork from Yale in April and they were fine but I think for a while, that number is going to go up and down until we recover fully from chemo.",

Texas: that kid must feel some severe pressure on that kickball team, man! I LOVE \"The Voice\" and I also watch Idol and Dancing with the Stars! I must admit, I never watched Idol until a little last year and every show I have seen this year. I have watched Dancing with the Stars for a few years. I enjoy those shows. I really like Idol because Tyler is on it. Everyone says they got better talent this year with having Randy, Jenny and Steven. The top 5 are all great. I can't understand coaches that find making a girl cry over a kickball game is fundamentally appropriate. That is just wrong. I am glad you all are going to coach next year. Tex, I am going to go out on a limb here and point out the obvious, but when is the last time you had your eyes checked? Chemo really messes with your eyes and if you are doing a lot of computer work etc... it really could just be that you need glasses/a new rx etc... That is cool about Walgreens! Sptmm: I am going to look like some hot chic with my Kotter fro and my Baby Phat \"Street cred!!!\" Deb, I have to bad ass....freakin' animals trying to push me around because I had 18 items in the 12 items line! The \"express\" sign was so miniscule it was quite easily missed! By the time I was done, they all shut their freakin' faces! I don't know who on earth would start with me but I bet they will think twice the next time before throwing a fit over someone having too many items in the express line! JSW: Oh....I don't consider it getting tough but rather it is just who I am! In any case, I wish you a very happy final boost day next week! This week I will have the date correct! How did the showing go?  Any snaps?   I wish you a firm offer soon!  Ckptry: you probably don't want anymore of my suggestions after the skin care recommendations but Graham Webb Brit Style Whipped Wax is great for hold without making your hair like a helmet. 2.5oz will probably set you back about $20, give or take, but it is money well spent. Graham Webb Brit Style Liquid Hold is a bit more expensive at about $23 for 4oz and it is a slightly stronger hold.  Neither leave your hair feeling like crust which is always nice! BTW, I love the new avatar! Omaz: I hope you are doing well. How are your long locks doing? Anymore knots?! Well, it is time for Kitty Fun House = me throwing her 50 million toys around the living room! If I don't do this at night, she brings toys into my bed to let me know she wants to play!!!! One thing I have to say is we sure do love our animals in this country! Goodnight all-",

I am hardly convinced that I want to be a parent but if I loved him, and it happened, I certainly would not be against the idea at this age. It is also weird to think I would be in my mid to late 50's when the child would graduate HS but so be it! Again, the mom thing was really not for me but I also, like Deb, can attest to the huge numbers of women I know, have met and my extended family knows who are having kids in their 40's. Don't forget the fabulous Joan Lunden either!!!!! Wasn't she like 53?! You can do it. You are mid-30's...that is still perfectly young. It is around my age when the body starts to put up a little fight about such matters!!!!! Iowasue: I was nervous, the most nervous, that morning going into surgery. For this reason, I did not have any family come with me and I actually had my friend who is a very funny guy and keeps me laughing come along! It was a good choice. He was very entertaining and there was no pre-surgery drama like there would have been if my sister and I went together! We would have been weeping and acting like sisters and that would have made me worse. I just hope you are too tired going in at 5:30AM (presumably!) to even think about it. In the end, I had nothing to worry about and, like you said, it was a really nice, long, albeit medically induced, sleep session...a much needed one at that! You will be fine. Sptmm: good luck tomorrow! I hope everything is fine. Keep us posted. Texas: how are you? I hope you are having a nice weekend. On a different note, a few months ago I told you all about Chelsea Handler having had her nutritionist on the show. He just seemed so genuine and so perfectly well-versed in all matters nutrition, I was compelled to listen. In any case, I decided to order his book and told you all I would report my findings back to you. As it turns out, my workouts are fine and my eating is basically ok but I have to make a few changes, a few tweaks as it were, to what I am already doing. The bottom line, for those of you frustrated with the 10 or 20 since chemo/midlife etc... that you can't seem to get off, you should get his book. It is called \"Body Confidence.\" I have been, for so many years, reading and checking into all things metabolic. This guy has got it all figured out. It is a good read. I told you all back when I said I was going to get the book that I would report back my findings. I read the book in 2 days. It is chock full of good information. I have some things to do but because it is raining, I just want to be lazy! I want to go lay in bed and read for the day! Oh..and my poor Yankees....they are having such a rough time a rainout might do them good! Good day, all-",

Rachel: speaking of meditation, I have never been good at it.  Again I am on the topic of Survivorship Clinic but I met the nicest woman and she shared her secret on how she finally became good at meditation.  She said she would envision herself in a circular room, sitting in the middle, and there were doors all around the room (a carousel enclosure comes to mind) and each door represented a thought. She commanded her mind to keep the doors shut and I have been using that technique and it works. I don't know if I will ever be great but I am doing better at meditating. As for cosmetics and such,  I never used face powder or liquid in my life but I do use Lancome eyeliner, mascara and, as I told you all, I am nothing short of addicted to Lancome Juicy Tubes!  I guess the nail polish had me worried and not so much about xenoestrogens but about just other items ingredients that could cause a new primary cancer.  In any case, I have to pick my poisons and I choose nail polish!  Soon enough I will be drinking and then inhaling exhaust pipe fumes etc... where will this madness end?!??!   Tex et al : on smoking, up until 8 I was in a 2 smoker house and from 8-22, I was in a one smoker house.   I can even remember smoking on the Metro North bar car!  Man, am I glad they cancelled that mess!  It looked gross...just a plume of smoke seeping out the doors at each stop.  I could not take it!  They just don't know what causes this.  I am sure some day they will figure it out and I hope we are all here to receive the news!  Did you all hear about beta blockers? Apparently they are examining those on beta blockers are getting dxd earlier and those who are on betas through chemo have less recurrence.  ",

Unfortunately I have some bad news. There is a pretty sizeable mass in the affected breast. They don't yet know what it is but it is there and it is big. I am deeply suspicious it is recurrence. I am so glad Yale has a cancer hospital and all my docs are there b/c my onc already communicated this to my surgeon. I will know more this week. This mass seemed to grow quite a bit seemingly overnight. Alas, that is where I have been. I will keep you all posted. Not the end of the world and perhaps it is not a tumor but I promise you that it is scary just the same. One year and 6 weeks from dx and here we go again. I am glad they did not use rads on me the first time b/c they will operate but no more chemo. That is the first thing I was told that if it comes back, there is nothing we can do. I would assume operation and rads would be next. Anyway, I am nervously getting ahead of myself! Sptmm: one thing that truly made me smile over these past few days was reading about Taylor and how she got those scholarships and the award!!!! I am so terribly happy for you and even if it does, as you said, provide her book money, that is a huge burden off of your shoulders. Those books can run in the just-below-on-thousand range these days. I am so very, very happy for you and her. That is so cool that she got other scholarships that cover that much of her tuition!!!!!!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!!! That is so great! Such good news. You must be so relieved. Even the cost of state universities here in CT are going up and the privates are $45K+ not to mention Yale at a daunting near $70K. I am just so happy for you. What a big bill to be nearly entirely relieved of and also she won't have to come out choking on loans. Do you know what she is going to study yet? In any case, so happy for you and her. Omaz: have a great vaca. I am sorry I missed you. I hope you get some much needed rest and relaxation. Enjoy, woman, and looking forward to hearing from you in a few weeks. JSW: oh yea, do I remember those boiling car days in FL! That air can't seem to come on fast enough! I think this weekend in CT I got my heat fix! Today it is probably around 85 combined with my hot flash index makes it about a good 94 I would say!!!!! I am all set now! As for cording, I had a PT appt at Yale. He reminded me of a great stretch to do once per day when you wake up. Use a wall in your house and either put one shoulder up against it to stretch out the chest muscles or, and this is the variation I like, put both arms against the outside of your bedroom door, for instance, and move your whole body forward, into the room, as if without your arms holding you back, you would plummet forward and hit the floor. That is a great stretch. Also add a little yoga if you have time. The benefits of yoga are far reaching. Drinking: I was out with friends last night and had some wine and it tasted great!!! I figured \"eff\" this crap! Why abstain when it seems as if I might be sponsoring my own cancer garden in my freakin' chest!!!! It was yummy yummy....Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot....I had some fun! Well, I hope everyone is having a nice weekend. Be well, girls, and enjoy yourselves-",

I just find it very disconcerting to touch someone and declare a mass to be scar tissue.  You worked at MSK and I am sure you have seen this type of situation several times.  I mean what are they going to say if I find out their \"touch\" analysis was incorrect and that this is cancer?  Then what?  Sorry is not going to bring my life back or the time I lost.  I am getting a 3rd opinion and it is going to be Boston, NY or I might go see my brother and go in TX for the 3rd.   Something is bothering me here and it is not going away.  I am losing sleep and I can't shake this.  You all know by now it is very unlike me to worry and I have taken this whole thing lightly but this is bothering me.   I think if I was an oncologist dealing with a person with a Stage IIb bc and I found a mass, I think I would have a lot of trouble arbitrarily ruling it \"scar tissue\" without investigating it or having it tested.  It seems cavalier to not want to check into it further just to be safe. Another thing that concerns me is this entire wound area has been getting air at it for quite a while during changing of the wound packing etc... and doesn't cancer *love* air?   Isn't that what we all, us common, non-medical folk, believe helps it grow?   I have never met someone who had a biopsy and who was convinced their tumors growing tremendously after the biopsy was an act of God and not related to it getting air at it and being messed with/woken up!!!   Mine went from less than 1cm to 2.5 in a matter of 6 weeks from the mammo/biopsy gig and the bmx.  How the hell did that crap increase 150% in size without some sort of provocation?   Yes, in long, I am concerned.   I am very concerned that they don't know what causes it, what fires it up, what brings it back and based on their enormous lack of knowledge about this disease, I can't help but think they are opprobriously remunerated for conjecture and furthermore should be investigating everything with bc patients based on their proven lack of knowledge about this disease. Something is bothering me these days, Carolyn, and it is not making me feel comfortable.",

It is good to hear from you. Omaz: I get sick after I eat quite regularly. It is getting to the point where I don't want to eat because I don't want those pains and to feel sick. Even a smoothie gets my stomach going. Adey: thanks for the reminder on the L Glutamine. I will either drink just that and forego my Metamucil or add it to the Metamucil! I mean to ask you what profile you are considering upon recon? Have you looked at all the options? I am confused. What is weird is the \"mature\" option...whaaa? Why even make something like that?! Calamtykel: sooo glad to hear you got an all-clear! Good news, woman! I can't believe an animal is coming during the day and killing your chickens. That is really odd. I hope you figure it out. My neighbor never found his chicken that disappeared a few months back. I know Bibbers was in a back room of the house where she has a rather larger perch on the window sill and came flying out of that room and all her hair was on end. All I could think was a coyote sniffed her out as it was late. This cat loves to sit at that window at night and watch what I call \"kitty broadway!\" There is something very intriguing about the back yard at night! This is the most ridiculous story ever me and animals: I was living in the city and was walking down the street and saw a raccoon coming toward me. As per usual, I start talking goofy animal talk to the raccoon and never is it dawning on me that if a raccoon is out during the day, especially in the city, it is RABID!!!!!!! Sometimes I don't know where my head is at! This coming from the woman who killed a daddy long legs in the bathroom who was acting like he was on crack (I never kill insects...I put them outside...but I was taking a shower) and then I saw that he/she left a baby behind and now I let that baby live in my house because I feel bad that I killed it's parent! Ginger: glad the UTI is clearing up. Good for you. As for the toenails, that is a lot to lose. Are any growing back? Sadly, on self exams, I *never* did them. I found it scary to do it because it always feels lumpy but conventional post-bc wisdom would alert me to the idea that not matter what it feels like, that is your baseline and it is important to know what that is. I just did not like doing it. Alas I don't have to check my implants! Texas: find another lawyer. Either their exists a conflict of interest they are not talking about OR they don't feel they can make enough money off of it. They don't have to prove WHAT stage you were but rather that you HAVE IT. Call other lawyers. Get other opinions and keep calling until you find somebody that understands that is total negligence and you should not be led to believe you are seeing a doc when you are actually are seeing a CAN. That is ridiculous. Keep calling and call *out of your area.* What some lawyers do is collect from the party you are attempting on the side to not sue and to dissuade you from suing. Call, get in there, talk to a lawyer and feel free to walk away if you get the sense any bs is going on. Don't lay off this. The bottom line is they did not even test you for what are obvious signs of bc. Find someone else to take the case and look for a female lawyer. Happy trails to you all and have some fun this weekend ;)",

I colored it and now I want to lighten it....damn...it is going to take a long time to get back to my previous length!  It is 5 months post-chemo and I am just nearly 2\" long!   It will take 3 years, at this rate, to get to 12\" long :( Calamtykel: I totally forgot about yeast overgrowth!  With Body Confidence, I have given up all sugar.  Of course, I go off plan once or twice a week by 95% of the week is sugar-free.  Sugar should be ruled a narcotic.  It is very deliterious. Ckptry:yeah, I think law is definitely my strong suit.  Then I will help all the girls with bc who are losing their jobs, getting abused by docs etc.... and I will enjoy every single minute of it!!!!  I will also do estate planning and capitalize on my 10 years on Wall St.  I am happy with my decision. I also agree with you and Kel that this dramatic reaction to additional scanning etc... will become easier as time goes on.  It will just become the norm for us eventually. Again, we have to be thankful to live in this country with this dx because, as I was researching liver cancer (sorry but that damn google sucks me in every time!), I found that death is highest in underdeveloped countries where they don't even have a modicum of detection. That little fact helped me to straighten up my attitude about more scanning!   I know our healthcare is screwy and the country does not seem to know how to take care of it's populace, alas it is better than a lot of countries and for this, I am grateful. Omg...horrible insurance story.  As you all know, my BIL passed on quite unexpectedly and suddenly in February at 50.  Well my sister has worked over the years but primarily she was stay-at-home and took care of the kids.   In any case, when my BIL passed away, she summarily lost her health benefits.  She got onto this plan in CT called Husky for low-income as she is not working and he was the bread winner.  In any case, I took her to her orthopaedic last week and he treated her like crap b/c she is now on state insurance.  Of course, I don't let anything go and I told his receptionist, who was giving my sister an attitude about what was covered, that but for the grace of God, there goes she and she should be a little nicer.  Then she decided to try to dance with me....I put her in her place in such a way I am positive she will never forget.  People don't realize that at some point we could all be on some form of that type of insurance and these doctors are going to have to shut their face and take what they can get or shut their practice and get a job as a cashier at Walmart!  God knows I would suggest they go to another country but they only practice here, and in such large numbers that we are tripping over them, because they make more money here, in this country, than they would in any other country by gross, gross margins.   Welfare insurance will no longer be considered \"welfare\" if the entirety of the country has it...they will just have to adjust! ",

Ground hogs-they live at the edge of my yard and the momma had babies this year. One of my neighbors asked me last year if he could shoot them- I think you all know what my answer was to that! My other neighbor came out today after I went out to drop apples to them talking about a relocation plan! He remarked that he used to have one and now we have the father and mother and these babies!!!!! He was talking as if a family has moved into the neighborhood that are dragging us down! I am feeding them in hopes that they won't attack my other neighbor's garden and now the neighbor with NO GARDEN wants to relocate them because there are just too many now!!!! The freakin' hibernate for 6 months and I think they are adorable! I can't believe these people. I have declared, and for the last time, there will be no killing or relocating of the ground hogs! Geesh, can't we all lvie together?!? Calamtykel: I don't know what the solution is either and good, bad or indifferent, and I don't say this to be incendiary, Obama has got a point. Obviously I don't have kids so I did not know how hard it is getting to keep them insured. I have excellent health insurance myself but what I have seen and heard over this bc battle is very upsetting about major shortfalls in insurance. We do need some sort of government sponsored healthcare. I know socialized medicine scares us all but the premiums of which you speak scare me more! Rachel: I hope you are having a nice vacation and are doing well.  Of course I hope you have some good stories for us when you get back! Zenith: good to hear from you, woman! I am hopeful by Xmas I will have an appreciable amount of hair to style and, until then, I will use those home kits and play with highlighting! I am, however, growing tired of this butch look and the fact that I have to wax my upper lip and brows every other week really just does not settle well with me! I would like it all to be concentrated on my head, man! Keep us posted one how things are going with you. I also get numbness all over now and intermittently. I get it on the tops of my feet, bottoms of my feet, on occasion on the affected arm, both hands but never all fingers, only the first 4 on each side and never at the same time, on my legs in different places etc... I am hoping that 1 year post chemo marks a time when none of this stuff is happening anymore. The oncs all try to distance chemo from our new found, post-chemo symptoms!!! It is such a joke. You just want to scream \"I did not have all this shit before!!\" and soon I am only pretty sure that is what is going to happen with me! Ckptry: I hope you had a good holiday weekend and Aidan continues to toss those baskets! I am a Nets fan and they need some help so force him to practice! Lady: you have to tell me your August date because I will be sending all kinds of good vibes your way and best wishes for the closing of that door and finally. I hope you have an extended summer in Alabama and can go to your lake house and put all of this crap behind you after that last tx in August and have a few months of R&R as you recoup. Best wishes to you. Sweeney: good to hear from you.   You don't have to keep up, just stop by and say hi!  Sptmm: congratulations on your memory returning! You know what I am talking about, right?!??! Haha aha! One thing I can say is my memory has definitely gotten better. Like I said, I think a year from the end of chemo most of us will be back to normal. After all, most of us went through 4-6 months of poison being pumped through our systems. Omaz: we are rowing the same boat on those temperature fluctuations! Mother nature is definitely playing my thermostat! I have a small fan/space heater on my desk and I can tell you that almost daily, even with temps going into the 90's here, I will use the heater at least once! Overnight is when the real fun starts with A/C and 2 fans going and then blankets off sweating! In any case, I am glad human beings don't have the same properties as your flip flops as we would have gone the same way by now! Sptmm: on the cold all the time, I really don't know how many more winters I have in my body. I am seriously getting a house in FL in the next few years. I don't think I could do much more than the 3 years it is going to take me to finish law school. Texas: what is going on, woman?! You must still be celebrating your NED status and, on that note, we probably won't hear from you until some time next year!!!! Hope all is well! This month is 1 year without my cycle so I am starting to think I am in menopause which I think is good anyway because of the added benefit of my body not having interest in making estrogen! Friday is the CT scan. Here we go.... The crazy dreams continue! Last night I was in a gutted Westfield Shopping Town in the future and it was all like \"Mad Max!\"  Myself and a bunch of people I don't know were looking for gas and wine!!!!   I think these taxes and gas prices are scaring me!!!

Question to other tri-state folks: are you all seeing more earwigs than usual? My house is about 500 feet from a lake but there are more earwigs than ever this year. I am thinking it is the enormous amount of snow we had? Zenith: your \"where did I get this bruise\" story reminds me of my old party days!!!! The worst was waking up and not knowing where my dress went!!! Not joking!! I never found it! Lady: so, as of today, it is less than 6 weeks until you are done!! YAY!!! Good news. I am so happy you are almost done with this. Calamtykel: Oh yeah, I now seem to remember you explaining this NJ healthcare situation before. In fact, it was right about the time your husband's healthcare changed because your previous provider left NJ. I also hear quite a bit of dubious news on your Governor! In any case, clearly a monopoly has created a mess for healthcare purchasing. That is a shame. When I worked on Wall St, so many from NJ spoke of it like living in NJ was the greatest thing every! I really think they could have organized a garden state parade! As for the waiting, I am with you. I am getting the CT scan on Friday and will probably have to wait until Tuesday or Wednesday to find out if it is mets and then onto more BIG C drama!!! I hope your results are fine and I am glad they investigated as a 2 week period is a caveat of sorts. I am sure it is probably just another benign gift of our post-chemo life! Good night all and happy trails-",

PLEASE, readers of this thread, spread the word: NO IMMEDIATE RECON! Wait until after mx/bmx to see if you need chemo and/or rads and only then, after chemo and rads is done, consider recon. Just do the extra surgery as it could very well save your life. Ginger: I look atrocious! Not only is my hair reaching for the stars in this Walken-esque look, now I have dark circles from not being able to sleep much for days while waiting for results!!!! I am almost embarrassed to go out AND I am avoiding people! At least you have attractive ringlets and clown hair! My niece told me my hair looks cool because it is growing upwards in the back!!!! I think I am going to wear my wig again! Calamtykel: I hope you have such a good time at the park today and ride fly down in that toilet bowl water ride to your heart's content! You all are lucky you have kids....I look kind of odd at the water park!!! I can't believe how much my hair is growing upwards! I was holding my great niece the other day and I wondered why her new hair is growing in \"normally\" and my new hair is looking like heat miser!!! Geesh...someday perhaps I will be proud of my appearance again! Kel, that was when SNL was still funny! What has happened to that show?! I was thinking that perhaps we should organize a short, perhaps 3 day cruise sometime next spring for the girls from this thread. Maybe we can bring wigs and have our hair fight then!!!! I am going to see if my nephew has baby hair clips for my great niece yet and, if so, I shall take a few today! Reduced to borrowing my 2 month old niece's hair clips who probably has not even had a chance to use them yet! Mommichelle: cysts, boo hiss!!!! All these little innocuous things are enough to scare our post-bc dx hair regrowth off our heads!!!!! I hope all is well for you. Please keep us posted. Sptmm: I hear you on the 5 hours! Man, I look like a raccoon. Plus, in an attempt to knock myself out, I was doing laundry and on my treadmill at 2AM!  Then my friend from high school wants to come and visit Sunday! Perhaps I should tell her to wait until October 31st when she won't question my look!!!!! That is soo funny what your son said!!!! Why is it growing out?!? Oh man, the accidental abuse we take! Omaz: I am still hot flashing it up over here! All night....oh well...I was told I could not take black cohosh? For women who all have pretty similar variations of the same disease, we sure do get different information/advice! Well, I must get ready to go to my survivorship clinic! I am hoping for no ambush! I also hope I don't fall asleep in the shower. Calamtykel: I travel with an Ipad or my little travel computers and always have internet on the road via those or my blackberries. Please post when/if you get results today. I will be thinking of you and, as always, sending the most positive vibes ever! Good day, girls-",

I sure hope so!  I hope you all had a nice weekend and are finding some peace for yourselves Ckptry: the very last thing any bc patient needs is condescension from the aholes that are supposed to watch out for us and empathize. Why are RNs/APRNs much more emotionally astute than are our oncs? Is it just me? I dated a heart surgeon from NY Pres when I was NYC. He was so cool and a very nice guy. Point here is even though most of our oncs/surgeons would like us to believe mentally they are off in science land, that is just no so. They are just choosing to be there. Beer and Lucky Charms...now you are talking!!!!! Oh yeah..this is America, land of the \"if you can drink beer and eat Lucky Charms and still stay thin, you are perfect!!!!\" Don't sweat it, Carolyn! Add a shot of tequila to your Bud Light Lime and party it up!!!! I swear to God, sometimes I just think a lot of our docs are just flakes....total flakes! Calamtykel: the reason they are not checking D levels is because their main focus is to plow us full of that poison and then see how we do. Their job is done once chemo is over because even if D levels are out of whack, they can't pump us full of more poison so their hypothesis is over! That is the way I see it. Like I said, a lot of these docs are nut jobs. Also, as for the joker with the pic in his arm and his \"yuck\" to green shakes response, wth? Again, another whacko. The best advice I got from an ex-boyfriend when he found out I had bc, and having gone through a medical trauma himself in the past few years, was to be your own advocate. I have a firm understanding of that now. Off topic question: have you ever used Bonanza? I know you are on Ruby Lane and I am beyond fed up with Ebay after only a few months. Their policies have got to change and they need to protect sellers. I am also wicked tired of talking to India and having it be like kangaroo court and I get the book thrown at me. I am done with Ebay. I understand Bonanza allows sellers to leave negative feedback on buyers. Do you know that to be the case? Any other reco's on auction sites? Let me know. Lady: It is funny, I write responses as I read and your's about being your own advocate was right after Kel's! In any case, I am definitely going to get that book. As for weight and diet, they are wicked important. I am sure I told you guys already but my gyn put it quite succinctly: the bigger the fat cell the more estrogen it can (try) to make. I live in workout-ville now! As for the pics, I don't think they can be ENLARGED!!! Joking...but they really can't be....joking on the caps I meant! Sptmm: how are you? I miss hearing from you. I know it is summer and you are busy with your work and kids but just letting you know you are missed! Perhaps you have, with wild abandon, joined a traveling belly dancing troupe?!?he he he!!! Well, I am still trying to get my desk cleared off after all day and on the phones and to the post office etc....tiring! Have a good night, ladies-",

Spttm: OMG...I hope it will be fine.   I don't blame you for not wanting to worry your family and it is just as well not to mention anything.   Hopefully things are ok but what does \"atypical\" cells mean exactly?  If they consider those cells to be/potentially be pre-cancerous/cancerous, I would be careful about letting them do another excision.   BTW, it was like a sucker punch when I read your post.   Lately my (NON) breast area where the bc was found has been itchy....very, very itchy.  Well, of course that is one of the signs.  It got super itchy after I worked my chest the other night.  I am like eff this, there is no way I am flying off to any doctors about it!  I see the PS this month, my GP this month and the onc in September.   If it is still itchy when I get there, I will mention it! Deb, I truly hope you are going to be ok.   Another surgery is not so bad but if they think for 1 second there might be some bc lurking about, and I absolutely hate to bring that up and hate even more having to bring up the next point but, I would seriously consider mx.   I know that is harsh but I would be riddled with trepidation about letting them try removal again if they found more cancer and I had not had a bmx/mx already.    I know, our options are so completely luscious!   I have gotten very, very used to not having breasts!   I am sorry to say but I don't miss mine for not even 1/2 of a second!   Oh, Deb, my heart goes out to you.  Keep me posted and I hope all will be fine.

It just seems to me that they get going after I eat in particular. I guess I am alone on this one! Thanks for letting me know what your experience has been. There is so much going on with my body since chemo that I never had before like pains all over my stomach, both left and right, a cough I can't seem to get rid of, my stomach \"gurgles\" which is something totally new and alternating numbness in my hands. Of course, if I mention this to the onc I will be told immediately that all of that has NOTHING to do with chemo! But of course it doesn't.....! How does it feel to be back to work?  I can only imagine it gives you definition in your life again. It is all good. Lady: I hope you are having a nice weekend also. On JSW, I do agree with Carolyn that we have thinned out on this thread and, to be honest, I am pleasantly surprised we all lasted over a year now and that a few of us still do post. In any case, JSW is not the type to just fall off. She is concerning me. It is my most sincere hope that all of us have given at least some information to a family member to post for us in case something was to happen etc... I am getting pretty concerned about her. I am hopeful it is just the move to bama and the house-selling and traveling that has kept her busy and away from this thread. Did you make it to the lake house? I sure hope so! Take it easy on the water skiing, wonder woman! Ckptry: how are things going with Aidan and his \"retraining?\" Just wondering. I hope he is having a nice weekend with his cousins. Hope you are having a nice weekend as well. I have friends in different parts of NJ and the experiences seem to vary widely. That is good, however, as total decimation is disproportionally unfair! Calamtykel: please, say it isn't so? I can't believe your water heater and computer were zapped???? You poor, poor woman. I feel for you, Kel. It is just, and very unfortunately, one thing after another for you. There were parts of the shore in CT that were totally wiped out. House washing off into the ocean and now tear-downs because they are not inhabitable. I can't believe the devastation. I hope you managed to have a little fun this weekend. What a ludicrous notion I put forth in light of what you have been through but I know a little fun goes a long way also. Best of luck, Kel. Omaz: having a good weekend? I hope you are doing well. Sptmm: going to the chapel and her daughter's getting married! Hope you are having a nice weekend. I actually got some sun and am now a little lobster-ish and it feels good after having spent the summer hiding from the sun to avoid adding another \"c\" to my life!!!!!!! An awful byproduct of this mess in CT has been looting. I mean, I can totally believe it but it sickens me that people who perhaps would not behave so scandalously are being forced to do things they normally would not because of the tremendously high unemployment in this country. Three years we have been hearing about job creation. Where the hell are these JOBS and why was our congresswoman from CT in ITALY while the shore of the county she represents was being decimated by a storm?  She left for Italy the *day* before the hurricane hit CT.  Why did Congress even take a vacation this year? Why was the president in Martha's Vineyard? 10% of the country has NO JOB and several economists maintain that number is much, much higher due to the military etc... On the war idea, some have suggested the government won't pull out of the Middle East because it will devastate our unemployment numbers to have those previously off at war now adding enormously to an already startling statistic showcasing how much worse things are than they seem. The last thing Congress and the president needed were vacations. Happy trails, all-",

Sweeney: your hair appears to be growing back in perfectly, as if it was meant to be short and knows exactly where it belongs! Accept the crown, woman! You are \"OUR\" hair model! Mine is getting long enough where it is no longer growing north but the sides are still sticking out so the top is going flat and I now have wings....I am glad Halloween is right around the corner! BTW, I had flashback funnies (where I laugh hours later) at your \"Chips extra\" comment!!!!!! Rachel: I am reading again after not having done much reading for years and zero during chemo. In the financial industry I had such a deluge of material to read, seemingly constant, that I think I just got away from reading. It is great that you have a book club of friends. I am with you also in enjoying the \"feeling\" of reading a book. Sptmm: I am undoubtedly going onto an inhibitor as well as it has been over 1 year since I had mine. \"America's Got Talent\" finale was great! Eugene won and he was the singer that sounds like Sinatra/Martin. I am so glad he won. If you have a chance, as there was a dance troupe in the finale with him called \"Silhouettes,\" youtube them. They were an unbelievable act also. What was really cute was at the end the dance troupe of 30+ kids would crowd Eugene and hug him! He would crouch down a bit and hunker down a bit, ready for their love attack! I am glad you are enjoying that book, and the Nook for that matter! Your son made a great choice. Ginger: we all have old pictures from before this mess started. You are looking great today also because you are alive. \"Puffiness\" is an issue worldwide. Enjoy your look! More to this point, and an amusing little anecdote at that, my mother had on her staff 4 very wealthy women who were all from one very posh suburb here in CT working for her part-time. In any case, they were always engaged in a severe game of \"one upsmanship!\" One of the women, they all said, had good skin just because she was fat!!!! To be honest, she looked better than all of them! Just the other day I was watching a new sitcom on NBC where Maia Rudolph makes a good point about weight and age, as follows: you can either be thin and gaunt or have a fat ass and full/less wrinkled face! It was something to that effect. I say with age, enjoy the plump and forego the frump! Sweeney: awful on the lice. I hope you are getting things cleared up there. What a shame. My friend got a warning from the uber-exclusive private school about lice and \"bed bugs\" because of the traveling of some of the students and the tracking of bugs etc.... The school, mind you, is $20K a year. Not that spending more should matter but one would think all steps would be taken to avoid such issues. I guess, in reality, you really can't. Wherria!!!! Good to hear from you again!!!!!!! We are rowing the same boat on the potential for liver mets, btw. They found a mass in my liver through ultrasound and then it did not show on the CT scan. They said it might be fatty liver and that was the end of that. Well, unfortunately I am still bleeding anally and that is not from hemorrhoids, I can't even move my upper lip without my nose hurting as it is all dried out and there is blood coming from there as well, not flowing but just presenting itself in the Kleenex. I have a weird little cough that won't go, my lips have been severely for 5 months (finally going to dermatologist this week), my fingers swell, my joints hurt and then last night one of my back teeth fell out. I was STUNNED. I take impeccable care of my teeth, flossing constantly and going to the dentist semi-annually for check-ups. Needless to say, I am quite concerned as I take all of this information collectively and wonder what the heck is going on with my body. So, by all means, please, please stick around!!! We can support each other as we limp through this mine field! I think I speak for both of us when I say we never lived with the illusion we were above mets but liver mets would truly suck. Let's stay cautiously optimistic, shall we?!?!??! As for weight, I know it must be just horrifying for you having come from a \"weight concerned\" background as you have. I know the heartbreak of weight gains and the joy of loss so I know how you feel but only to an extent. I think it is just awful that you have competing diseases and troubled consumption as a result. I know this is a pita but I think you need some weight now just to fortify your body. Having enjoyed an athletic body for so long, you can achieve that standard again. For now, however, lack of nutrition is tantamount to physical disaster so feed the body. These bodies are not perfect machines and when they are needing help, we have to give it to them, at their peril! It is great to hear from you again....come back and keep us posted on your progress. We are all in this together, don't forget, and to that end, we are support for each other. Let us help you through. Rachel: on the liver biopsy, that is a very risky process that they generally don't get involved in. Someone at Yale explained to me how precarious a process it can be, and the benefit is not much as blood will tell the story with liver mets. I hope you are enjoying spinning! After my 10 doctor appts, what will now be fairly extensive dental work, and my next massive surgery in 4 weeks that will leave me with drains again (ugh), I might go back to spinning in January if I am recovered from all this mess!  I was talking to an old friend last night about all this stuff I am going through and I told him, as I will tell you all right now, I am soon going to ground zero and then to the Yankees v. Boston with fantastic seats (26 rows from the field, field level and a gift from my brother -I love him more today than yesterday!!) and then basically I am ready to go!!!!!! Of course, I am being silly but at the same time, I don't want to linger and I refuse to go through any chemo for liver mets. Absolutely refuse and if I was feeling better since they \"found the mass\" in my liver, I would think it was an innocuous situation but as I don't feel \"better\" and now my tooth fell out, I am starting to pack my bags!!!!!!!!! This world is for the healthy!!!!!!!  Yes, expiration is very much out of my control so I do have fun with the subject!!!!!  I hope you all are having a wonderful weekend and are having some fun! Good day, all-",

I just read a bit of that.  You see, I believe Teva uses E464 in the UK and other countries across the pond.  My suspicion is, as that is the most common binding agent that causes allergic reactions, they are manufacturing elsewhere using E464 and selling it here.   I don't think, or at least I have been unable to find out, if E464 is ok to use in this country but I did uncover that common allergic reactions are due to that particular agent.  This bc business is always interesting! Thanks so much for that thread.  Bottom line, if the one you are in is working, meaning giving you hot flashes and not other side effects, stay on it!  Sadly the hot flashes are an indicator it is working. Sptmm: HEY WOMAN!  I was just thinking of you today.  Deb, you never, ever think you might be getting dehydrated when all you drink is water constantly but that can happen.  I am stunned to read more about that.  I don't drink only water for diet reasons or for any other reason except for that is what I like.  I like seltzer and water only and no flavored or sugary waters either.  I hate juice because of all the sugar (unless you boil cranberries as Adey alerted me to doing months ago!) and I don't like soda.  Pre-bc I used to drink Diet Coke and water.  Had to ditch the Diet Coke because of phenylketoneurics so now I am down to just water. In any case, I drank 2-32 oz Gatorades today and am feeling a bit better.  I think I was just plain old dehydrated. As for your upcoming appt with a new PCP, I wish you the best.  My GP (aka PCP) is excellent and a lot of support for me through this entire process, if not my life.  More to this point, however, the cancer ball field is humongous and I can't very well put the onus of figuring out all this weird crap with me on his shoulders.  I mean I can only expect so much from one person.  The oncs, as you know, beat that drum long and hard about \"nothing to do with chemo and tamox.\"  In doing that, they demarcate.   They draw a line in the sand that says chemo is over, there is no coming back this way.   Between their fees and the cost of chemo, we should get a little more bang for our buck in the form of post-chemo assistance.  We all say the same things about these oncs so you know it is not a very widespread, and worrisome, trend.  Wasn't \"silhouettes\" great? Did you 'youtube' Eugene Landau Murphy Jr? He was amazing! I have never heard someone sound so close to Sinatra. Being Italian and growing up in the Northeast, Sinatra was as respected as Sunday sauce, as coveted as the rosary and as much a part of our lives as the family itself!! I remember being at my friend's wedding and going from Sinatra, for the family(!), to Guns N' Roses for us!!!! All the Sinatra fans could not get to the door quickly enough as they barked and complained of our musical paganism!!!! How are you feeling these days? Are you feeling stronger since surgery? How are you healing? I hope you are coming along. Texas: any news?  Did you find out what is going on regarding your scans? CKptry: where have gone, woman?!   I am sure you are busy but just letting you know I am thinking of you ;) I am so upset that it looks like the Yankees v Red Sox is probably going to be rained out.  I bought a plastic poncho today and will go to the stadium just the same but the weather report just seems to be getting worse.  I was so, so looking forward to this game.   I call September baseball pre-October baseball!  I will be so disappointed because a make-up game is not going to be of much interest as it will probably be Sunday afternoon AND the ACLS will most likely have been decided by then!  WOE IS ME!   ",

I did use one of my leftover pain pills and was relatively comfortable for the 3/4 of the time. I sent an email to my dermatologist today as this rash is spreading to my stomach, side of my breast and over my ribs, after washing all of my bedding and clothes in wicked hot water a few days ago, and I have pre-op in 2 weeks. I need this rash gone by then. I am so pissed. I want this failed tissue expander that has been in my chest for 16 months, gone already. Sometimes I wonder if this rash, just like the infection, is festering because of that foreign body. I am cancelling all plans/appointments this week and am going to focus strictly on getting rid of this rash. Thanks, everyone for your input. BTW, I was *never* allergic to this stuff..you guessed it, BEFORE CHEMO! Calamtykel: I agree that the \"buy pink\" campaign is a bunch of bulls*%$!!!!!!!! Clearly I think it is a way for manufacturers to bank on our disease. Then again, if they did not show us some concern, we would probably feel even more jilted!

The only thing I think about was knowing that I am officially \"old\" and the \"factory\" has been irreparably shut down!!!!!

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2011 01:52AM - edited Oct 4, 2011 01:54AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors- I was thinking of you all fondly this weekend. I am absolutely engaged in this baseball drama and will resurface in a few weeks! Tex: isn't that cool?! I love it! I look forward to switching screens now! Glad you went to the TX meet-up. CT does not really have an active group aside from the fact that we are #2 for bc dxs in this country! It seems kind of weird that there are not more on this site? I hope you join the gym. I think lifting is one of the greatest gifts you can give your body. Omaz: that is awful. I have had no experience with that. In fact, the first time I heard of it was from you. That is just awful. I feel for you and what her family is going through. What a startling turn of events. It is just scary. Geesh...I hope there is a turn for the better soon. Best of luck and I am sorry, I wish I had more information for you. Sptmm: a Yale student, just as I was dxd, had purchased something from me off of Craigs List (I deliver, even though it is a ½ hour, for free for Yale students!) and she actually gave me a card with the \"Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo\" rather well-know Buddhist chant. If you saw the movie \"What's Love Got To Do With It?\" about Tina Turner, you will remember her repeating that chant in one poignant scene. In any case, I have found that chanting does help. Meditation...in a lot of ways it is something you have to practice every day. I am frenetic by nature and I do try, using some of the tricks I learned at survivorship clinic, but in the end I guess it is not important enough for me to calm down and do it. I think, however, if you can martial the \"no-vacancy in your head\" space and do it, I think the benefits are wonderful. Think of all the work our mind does? All day and night...it never stops, luckily. I think meditation is a nice break for the mind. Ckptry: yes, perhaps I will get a second. You are right, there is nothing wrong with seconds. I also have Blue Cross and I think I am covered in the Northeast in general. Christie?!?!? Uh oh.....we all better get the *&^% off the beach when he says so!!!!! Geez....I hope that \"get off the beach\" comment is not a cornerstone of his campaign!!!!! Rachel: that is so great that your son ran and did not outrun the adults! Was it purposeful that he did not just race past everyone? That is just great. Good for you for walking. He got his running from your fabulous, pre-bc self! Own it, woman! I mean, of course, you are still fabulous but just not fabulously running just yet ;) Only a matter of time. Wherria: good points on core. I will tell Tex the \"lifting\" diet now! Tex: if you do join the gym, you do need to work your muscles rather methodically. The following is the way you need to work your muscles, by group: Day 1: back and bi's; Day 2: chest and tri's; Day 3: shoulders; Day 4-glutes, thighs and calves. Legs are a really big day and the reasons you need to work your muscles in this way, and light, when starting out is to avoid injury. You do all your pushing on one day, all your pulling on another day and then shoulders and legs separately. Shoulders can involve both pushing and pulling and legs are just a big workout. Now although it is your back that is of issue, you have to work the entire system because are only dotted lines to each other. Also, and to speak to Whitney's point, you need to do some core work with a medicine ball. I forget because it has been so many years and probably 50,000+ crunches (not joking) that I really forgot to remind you of that. The bonus about lifting is that you can eat more because your body desperately needs the additional \"protein\" fuel. In fact, just get a jug of Muscle Milk off of Amazon (no soy) and add 2 tbsp of coconut oil after each workout and you will be good. That is the best way to get very beneficial coconut oil (which you have to have daily to really reap the benefits) and you will get the extra calories, protein and coconut oil you need. If you have any questions about any of this, or about lifting, just PM me. I can most likely answer your questions. Well, I have some errands to run. I hope you all had a nice weekend and for those of you working and getting run down, I wish you all the best. Sometimes I can't even imagine working full-time again. It is such a strange place to be. Good day, girls-",

I hope you all continue to, and only, fight the good fight!   I have been busy getting organized for surgery this week.   There is a lot to do and it is also a celebration of being liberated from the confines of what has been a long, and somewhat arduous, battle.   This is, I am hoping, the final surgery and I will go on to live many long & fulfilling cancer-free years.   Here's to hoping!  More to this point, however, one, some or all of us, at some point or another, are most likely going to deal with cancer again.  PLEASE, please, please-make sure you come back here and share and seek comfort.   This is not a place to avoid should cancer come knocking again but rather a place to return to for support and understanding.   This I want our legacy to be. GINGER!  Great to hear from you!  I miss everyone when they don't post but I truly believe that when I don't hear from someone for a while, it was necessary for you all to get busy again and for this to become a place you stop once in a while, as it should be.  It is all part of evolving beyond bc.   The only person I am not convinced this applies to is JSW, however.  I do miss her and am not convinced her silence is because she is too busy to stop by.....I am concerned about her.  In any case, I digress!   Ginger, I have my weepy moments as well but I sure am glad you got out and took a class so you can better understand the rather complicated gift that was given in love from your dh!    I am sorry to say but over 40 means you are officially beyond understanding technology and I think I am going to remedy this situation with a \"understanding tech\" school!  I am so glad you got out and *stayed* even through your tears.  That is a very good sign. Speaking of tears, I am not a person that sheds a lot but I will admit \"Extreme Home Makeover\" will bring on the tears at times!   When they do the final reveal, I am often times teary for those that are enjoying such wonderful blessings.  A few days ago I was cooking and was watching \"Ellen.\" Yes, I have a TV in my kitchen!  In any case, a young military couple had written to her about how their house savings had been wiped out due to their infant son's health issues.   It was so sad to hear the letter as Ellen read it on her show.   She, of course, took action and went to the couple's apartment, cameras rolling, and gave them a plethora of high-end electronics from the Ellen bus (I don't really get to watch her show much but apparently this bus arrival connotes good tidings!) and a check for $15K!  Sure enough, before you know it I was crying!   Thank you tamoxifen!   Come back and let us know how you are doing.   Keep in touch, woman! Tex: Happy Birthday to your son!   You are fast becoming another one where I don't know how you do it all especially with school and \"little\" kids!  Amazing!  Best of luck on the nursing exam and don't forget those online websites where there are quizzes etc...   I have been doing logic problems which is a fun way to prepare for the LSAT!  I am kind of rusty, sadly.   In any case, I know you are very busy these days but it is refreshing to hear from you ;) Omaz: are you still working with the personal trainer?  I wondered about that a few days ago.   It is funny how you all are a part of my life, in that I am reflecting on you all \"off thread,\" and that is just wonderful!  I am so grateful for this site. Ckptry: I hope you had a good time at the soccer game!  How is cutesy little Aidan?!   I don't want him to feel pressured but I hope he is still practicing shooting hoops as I do expect he will SAVE the Nets some day!  Surgery is actually Thursday.  They said I am going to be in surgery for roughly 5 hours and during pre-op they mentioned I might go to ICU briefly afterwards to make sure I am stable.   I actually have a question for you: they always ask in pre-op if I donated my own blood preemptively to avoid a transfusion.   Is that SOP?  Also, wouldn't I do that under the recommendation from my surgeon as opposed to voluntarily or is it good practice to just do that anyway?  I try desperately not to ask professional questions of anyone here but, in this case, I need your opinion on this matter!  I also pester Kel for online tips!   If anyone needs any market info, feel free.  I lived it for over a decade! Calamtykel:  I know you must be busy with your holiday ecommerce and everything else that you do but just thought I would let you know I am thinking of you!  I have been doing a lot of research on \"alkaline\" state and this made me think of you.  On that note, EVERYONE should be having a glass of lemon water morning and night...just one small step, girls! Zenith: if you are still reading, I have to be honest when I tell you I still have flashback \"funnies\" to your story, when we were on chemo, of going for a walk with your husband and falling down and laying there!  It was something about the way you wrote it!  A few years ago I was out on NYE with my \"man!\" and a woman was leaving this restaurant/bar on a really busy street.  Tony and I had been sitting at the bar, and right near the door.   This woman left, and was pretty drunk, but had a designated driver.  She was on the driver's side, back door of an SUV and the designated was helping someone get in the passenger side.  They were parked on the street and the driver's was on the street side.  As I watched her fall and lay there in the middle of the road, I raced out there to get her in a split second.  I was the only person that left the bar/was not so drunk that my response was hampered.   All I could think was with the amount of drunk driving, it being NYE and 1AM, and that being a very busy street, she was going to be hit quite quick.  I was having dinner at that same restaurant a few weeks ago and that woman came up to me and said how she never had a chance to thank me etc... She apparently is a regular and someone at the bar knew it was me and let her know I was there.   The words she used to describe how she was laying in the street reminded me very much of the story you told and I had some extra laughs!  In any event, she paid for our meals and drinks as a way of saying thank you!  Clearly she did not have to do that but it was nice just the same!  Among other things, the way she described her fall made me think of you!  Hope you are well. Obama: something weird is happening in the employment market!  I think he finally cracked the whip on banks and brokerages to get moving on hiring after they enjoyed such a humongous, and beneficent, bailout.   Myself and a number of people I still speak with from the industry have, as of late, been getting email alerts from recruiters at the large banks and brokerages.   It is anomalous.  My resume is out there but I have not done anything with it in years.   I am amazed that in the past month I have gotten as many emails about jobs/offers in the financial industry as I had for nearly the entire year.   Just letting you all know that my friends and I believe, and armchair analysis says, the pressure is being put on those profit hogs to hire!!!!!   The economy: there is a local haunted trail of terror type of maze that is charging $15 admission for kids?!  I find that to be quite high, in this economy, and for a 5 minute trot through a spook fest?!   I think $10 would have been sufficient.  What is wrong with people?!  Perhaps that is average and I am just getting older, and cheaper, by the minute!     OK, I am officially jealous of J Lo!!  I am not a jealous person either but, as if she did not have what can be largely considered \"it all,\" now she has the ultimate trophy=BRAD COOPER!!  He is the kind of guy that if I were talking to him I would not be able to *listen* to what he was saying as I would be far too engrossed in his aesthetic value!   Gadzooks...life just keeps getting better for her!       Good day, girls....and just in case any of you were wondering, yes, my Xmas tree is up!!  I went fake many years ago and never went back because, and as you all know, I LOVE animals, in particular cats and real trees and cats...well, not always a good match!",

Sptmm: Deb, I am so glad you are going off to see your brother and using your time left that way.  I do think you need a little break for yourself.  I am glad you have enough time left to go.  BTW, you did not disappoint me at all.  You know what I say?  A person as goodhearted as you, if you were going out of your way to not overburden your coworkers it would be because they were that good to you.   I know all about the workplace nonsense.   Do you know that my supervisor, 28 year old punk, did not even SIGN MY GET WELL CARD?  He also discouraged the people in my unit from sending me anything when they found out I had bc AND after they signed the get well card he NEVER MAILED IT because he said he could not get my address from HR.   Finally, one of the employees, who found out through me the card had not been sent, asked him and all of the sudden he found it in his desk.  Consequently, and besides the fact that he must be a closet psycho, I have no idea why he behaved like this.  Deb,  I know ALL ABOUT workplace creeps.  My mother ran her own marketing company and if one of her employees EVER treated an employee that had gone out on disability due to breast cancer in such an egregious and ruthless manner, they would have been fired.  What kind of a sicko behaves in such a deplorable manner?  The kind that marches his family off to church every week....duplistic pig.    The alpha male looking to control his family through church meanwhile behaving like an absolute colostomy bag while working  for one of the largest wireless providers in the country, that company which proudly beats the \"we support victims of breast cancer drum\" long and hard....well, wouldn't they be proud to know how AWFUL one of their supervisors behaved toward an exemplary employee with breast cancer.   The company WOULD NOT want this; this was him acting out in some sick way over who know's what.     So, Deb, I know ALL ABOUT grotesque and shameful behavior in the workplace.  What goes around, comes around, woman...!   Take your time, go to NC and take a few extra days if you think you need it!  Your trips to Italy are coming, Deb.   Sadly, and because of the way life goes, someday someone in your office is going to be suffering from a disease of some sort and you, too, will be going on a vacation.   Such is the circle of life.  My new boobs feel good!  It is so weird to put on a shirt and actually have boobs!   To actually have boobs again!  My GP kept telling me I was missing them and I told him no blah blah....well, I think he was right!   I am happy to have these old fat sacks back!  These are nice and firm and require no bra....yeah, I like these and much more than I liked the old models!

I wish there were general \"tech\" schools where we all could go to learn our phones and fancy gadgets we love so much! It is really wonderful that you found such a school. I have been meaning to tell you, as you named \"names\" on that doctor in Chicago, before I hired a PS when this bc first started, I interviewed a number of them. One of them was such a gargantuan ahole, I will put him on blast some day but, and the reason this is pertinent, when I was sitting in his lobby there was a woman who had a $6000 balance with him. She was there to charge up some more crap and it turns out she was on the \"board\" of some charity. The \"board\" in totality was her and her boyfriend!  She was also going on about her trip to Belize that was only around the corner.  I just got the impression that she was the sole beneficiary of this \"charity\" she established.  Reason I know about her balance is because she quite candidly asked while I was sitting there waiting. These \"humanitarian\" projects and fundraisers oft times go way off track and greed takes over. There was just a guy outside the local grocery store collecting money. He was handing out some piece of paper regarding his \"organization\" I guess, to lend legitimacy. I gave because I really wanted that paper. It turns out his \"organization\" is on a Connecticut watch list. I just got the distinct impression he was pocketing every dime and was fundraising for himself. Not that any of these issues are plaguing the organization you are involved with but remember that distance provides perspective. Take a year off and reevaluate. You may never go back to it. I finally, after many moons, know what people mean when they say \u2018you just can't help.' Everything becomes so convoluted...problems. Step away, maintain your health, draw perspective and enjoy your sewing class. Finally, everything runs its course. Perhaps your time with that organization (the one that you knew it to be) has run its course. As for putting us on a coma on this thread, the tumbleweeds have been beginning to blow here. This is a good sign. This means we are all getting healthier, back to our normal lives and our thread may have run its most active course. Occasionally I know people will come back and post but it is winding down and has been for months. I will always stop by and post here and there and others do as well but we are also running into the busiest part of the year for everyone with the holidays. Ginger, give yourself a break. I think, based on what you have said, you have devoted an enormous part of yourself to things you believed in for many, many moons. You are no fool and will give all of yourself when the mission is whole and warranting appropriate results. When this is no longer the case, you have to walk away.   Relax now and enjoy your granddaughter and sewing class and some more lighthearted things for a while. The only constant is change....embrace, woman! Good day!",

Mommichelle: good to hear from you again.   The very angst you experience when going for the mammos and MRIs is exactly why so many people get prophylactic bmxs.   If I ever had to go through this past year and a half again all because I wanted to hold onto one of my breasts, I have no clue as to how I could have dealt with such a situation which is why I knew the other one had to go.  Best of luck, it is not an easy choice.   Consider Brava and Microfat grafting and all the new options available to you.  Also, Adey from this thread is going to a renowned reconstructive facility in NOLA.   If you search \"NOLA\" you will several threads talking about what they do there.    There are so many new options available to us, check it all out.   Good luck with this tough decision. Rachel: the Caribbean for NYE....wonderful!   I love, love, love being in a warm climate for NYE!  Good for you...splendid idea! Ok, so I bought Adele's \"21\" cd and I love every song on it!   Not since Maroon 5's \"Songs About Jane\" have I loved an entire CD so much!    Music is such a gift. Good day-",

Rachel: I am too sensitive to the history of this country to even watch \"The Help.\" In fact, I don't even like the title. I know it is an acclaimed film but as far as I am concerned it revisits a time in our history that no one wants to so we very well could have survived without it. I know it glorifies how the employed domestic engineers of a certain era raised the children of wealthy families and, from what I understand, it is done very well. On that note, however, there is nothing new under the sun even though this film serves to glorify this evolution. Wealthy families having nannies, butlers and the like raise children is so nothing new. I do like the work of Emma Stone, however! An ex of mine from my NYC days was from Greenwich. Do you know his parents sent him to boarding school at 7? There is a school in the Northeast who takes kids that young. That is sick. For many, absurd wealth means outsourcing parental responsibilities. I am done!!!!!! Ginger: joke delivered!!!! Sorry! It is not unlike a child to elect a new name just the same! I hope you all are having a nice weekend and, if stress comes your way, start humming Bob Marley's \"Three Little Birds\" because you know what? He was right! Everything is going to be alright! Alright...so coming clean: when I was in love with the guy who did not love me back I was kind of seeing another guy in whom I had very shallow, albeit potent, interest! He would always say \"everything works out, you'll see!\" So take Adam's words with you this weekend should trouble or stress come to pass!",

In any case, as for me I think biopsy is next.  I will know more in the next few weeks.  Cancer is an albatross!!!!!!   ",

I know they can light up for a number of things but because it is right where the cancer was before, kind of scary. See PM for more details. Both boobs are really itchy and the CT and MRI were inconclusive. When I started to call some cancer hospitals about getting seconds almost every one of them asked me where the PET scan was. I did not even know what it was but when I learned that it is radioactive glucose, I figured that has got to be one good test to identify mets. Using radioactive glucose, they can target even the smallest recurrence. I think PET scans are the greatest thing when it comes to finding cancer hiding in the body. Unfortunately, and like you pointed out, it is not a perfect science. That is so cool that you have 3 acres to ride on! I would love that. You are safer riding on your own property anyway. A friend of mine played football for Syracuse and one summer in college we lived together. He would ride his bike like 70 miles a day! It was amazing. He was so addicted to that bike. I have a cruiser bike and like to ride a linear trail near my house. They keep extending it and now it is like 50 miles or something. It is hardly challenging but it is just nice to have a place to ride away from cars as my friend was eventually hit by tourists on the shoreline in CT. He lost a semester of playing football b/c of it. In any case, glad you are keeping busy even though your foot has given you trouble.

I swear, we had so much fun, I loved that guy. He was hysterical and so hot. You know, when Irish guys are good looking, they are really, really good looking like Colin Farrell!!!!!!!! I am going to stop now! I met him one night on the E Side when I was going out with this other bloke!! Tony was from Ireland and he knew Farrell from the motherland! He and I both speak wicked fast and, when I drink, I get faster and more succinct. There was no way Tony could keep up with us! The Dinosaur Museum?! My father took us to Dinosaur State Park when we were young and my friends that came with and I were hysterical as it was *the* most boring trip ever!!!!!!!!!

Calamtykel: I *always* think about my immune system being so freakin' busy catering to the likes of my broken thyroid (or the broken thyroid distracting the immune system because it is broken and needy!) that cancer has all the opportunity in the world to come back.  Right now I feel so weak, achey and horrible and I have not even been able to get on the increased synthroid yet b/c I am finishing the other bottle of the lower rx.  It takes weeks anyway for the synthroid to start working on a troubled thyroid.  In long, yes, yes, I do share that concern.   I hope you are feeling better.  What you describe makes me nauseous just reading it!   I must have gone through 3 large boxes of Kleenex in the past 2 days and now I like to just leave the Kleenex right on my nose so I am ready!!!!!!!!! I literally lay in bed with the Kleenex right near my nose as I go from stuffed to running like a faucet!!!  I hate this. Off to bed!  I just had some Theraflu and now it is time to go get some rest and of course my eyes are watering as well!  I HAVE to be done with this for surgery.  I want that mass out of my chest.  Well, I guess everything happens for a reason...!   I think I might get the Darwin award this year!!! Night all- ",

      "Content": "Mar 15, 2012 02:45PM - edited Mar 15, 2012 02:52PM by 1WonderWoman Good evening warriors! I hope you all are having a lovely evening! I could not have ordered better weather than we are having in CT these days. Unbelievably nice out and next week we are going to hit 80!!!!! YAY! I cannot wait! I really do prefer warmer weather. Tex: 30 is a HUGE birthday and for us bc girls, it is even bigger! You have to PM me your birthday, please! I plan to make a fuss!!!! Calamtykel: I am glad you are going away but am sad it is for the reason your grandfather's health is failing. I sure hope you get there before anything happens. Rachel: I am so glad the appointment went well. The other day someone called me to say the docs thought this and that and I finally told that person that I am not too concerned with what they think as they have been wrong before and I am sure they are going to be wrong again. Tests and pathology are definitive and everything else from these docs, as they don't have magic eyes and can't see the future, is pure conjecture. On that note, your doc is smart to remind you no one is ever really \"free\" of cancer and that the risks are there, albeit small, but they are there. I have all kinds of weird pains and now recently under my arm on the affected side and on the back of that arm. I also have these little zinging pains around my back which I *never* had before in my life. I have finally decided to chalk it all up to getting older and forget about it! Seriously, all this crap we feel, it is entirely feasible it has nothing to do with recurrence. At least this is what I am hoping for! So enjoy your vacation and put it out of your mind.  I am sure you will be fine.  I am telling you, I think the only way to beat cancer is to put it out of your mind completely.  If I ever have some FREAKIN' BREASTS again, perhaps I can do that.  I was so disgusted today looking at summer shirts and thinking I have no freakin boobs.  My friend just met some guy and she was talking to me about meeting his friend and I reminded her that 1/2 MY EQUIPMENT is missing!  I mean seriously, this has just worn me out.  Rachel, back to the issue at hand: ignore cancer and read Kevin Trudeau's book about the natural cures they don't want us to know about and ignore thoughts of recurrance.  When I have some breasts again, that is precisely my plan! Well, the forces that be certainly have a sense of humor! My thyroid has been out of whack for years and completely since chemo as my TSH recently was 6.1. This means it is roughly 100% worse than it should be. The med was increased and this is my life and I just deal. In any case, my last cat that died of old age at 18 in 2008 was hyperthyroid and I am hypothyroid. Her vet used to have so much fun with me talking about how it would be so nice if she and I could switch and he would giggle, rubbing his little paws together, like a mad scientist!!!!! Also he never saw the \"Jungle Book\" so he would pronounce her name :Mao-glee (and he used to really hang on the \"ow!\")  In any case, I noticed Bibbers, the new cat (my friend and I were roughly 7 Coronas deep when we named her!), is quite slender! She normally is 11 lbs but now she is just over 9lbs and she eats turkey, chicken and fish plus she has her dry food. In any case, yes, the thyroid lottery has struck once again! My cat has been blessed with hyperthyroidisim!!!!!! She can eat and sleep all day and STILL lose weight! Mind you I called Mowgli's vet (the cat that has passed) and he was just hysterical! He found it just hilarious that this has happened once again! Alas life is full of joy in the form of merciless paradoxes! And so it goes, and so it goes! Happy trails, all-",

It is so cold in CT tonight, when I walked out of Whole Foods, I wanted to go straight to JFK and head for the equator!  Right now it is 32 and heading for the upper teens.  Yes, it was 83 degrees 5 days ago!!!!!!!! I can't take it! Omaz: I opted for mango salsa b/c I realized kale makes people think of cancer and I just decided to skip it!  What I did do, however, is just cut up some kale and put it in my salad this weekend.  As it turns out, I like it raw, just the way it is!  I could eat it like a popsicle!  Not joking when I tell you I used to like to eat sand and/or dirt when I was young!  Apparently kids will do that if there is some mineral deficiency.  Well, I tell you this because that kale, for whatever reason, takes me for a trip right down memory lane to my old dirt eating days!!!!!!  I swear, it is so weird.  In any case, I am going to make the chips this week.  I just love it just the way it is.  It is yummy!  An elderly woman approached me at WF tonight and saw me buying kale.  She asked me what I do with it and I told her I eat it raw, just as it is but then told her about the chips.  Sure enough she was heading home to make herself some!  She was so cute!  What started her talking to me was my wearing my WINTER coat!  Poor thing had on one of those courdoroy Land's End deals which, on a normal day in March, would be fine in CT.  Too cold! Omaz, one question: why did the recipe I looked at call for \"kosher\" salt?  Perhaps it was written by a Jewish author but, aside from that, do you know why they might call for that?  Is there any difference except for the Rabbi having blessed the kosher salt?!   Just wondering.  Tex: no excuses!  Make that appt!  Rutabagas are just like turnips although they take about 4 weeks longer to ripen.  I love turnips.  Generally what I do is just mash them with a fork and some S&P.  That is it.  Of course a lot of people like butter.  Rutabaga and turnips are great for roasting or mashing.   It is great to try something new.  I was so happy to find some broccoli rabe on sale today...some garlic and a little EVOO, race it around in the pan with a pinch of onion salt...yummy!   I am also beyond enthralled that the \"farmers markets\" are starting up again in CT.  There are a few that go all winter but these next 7 months there are farmers markets almost daily...yummmmmmmmy!    Well, I am going to go stare at my fireplace and decide if I want to fire it up or not!  I want this cold weather G-O-N-E!  Night, girls- ",

I am not going to lie when I tell you all this juice was super healthy and super GROSS! I juiced a head of bok choy and 8 organic carrots! Dr. Oz is right when he says you feel immediately energized after having Lady: yesterday HGTV was in Alabama on the TN border. In any event, they were in the most adorable with these 2-3 bdrm homes that were on 1/2+ acres and they were only $90K!!! I was stunned! Then you mention that it is hot and I nearly have to control myself from packing! That is a CT special re: going from winter straight to summer. Every year we go through that. That slaw sounds wonderful! On broccoli, I was all of 7 years old, just about attached to my Italian grandmother's hip in the kitchen one Thanksgiving. I will never forget as she was steaming my favorite, broccoli!!!! The smell was wonderful! I don't know how my parents did it but they got me into broccoli young! Consequently, on getting a life back, speak for yourself!!! Joking...so glad you are doing well and feeling good, Lady, there is a lot to be said for that. That is great about the kitchen spoon! That is wonderful ingenuity! Calamtykel: I will check on the Spelt pizza dough. Thank you! Well, I still have bok choy-carrot juice to drink....ugh! It is so healthy, I was rather hoping I could get used to it. I also don't like to cook the \"s\" out of vegetables b/c many, if not all, nutrients are compromised as a result (plus I don't *cook*) but I might have to start with the soy, oyster and brown sugar recipe if I am going to be eating that bok choy going forward! Aside from that, I will just double up on my artichoke consumption! Love, love, love artichokes just steamed in their beautiful, natural state! Good day, all!",

Of course, we are going to straight to summer on Monday as the highs will be in the 80s but it is spring today! Calamtykel: so glad you don't have Lyme! Good news! It is great that the practitioner found the bardo although you did not mention it. I think that is a very good sign! Where are these organisms coming from? I don't blame you for not wanting to go back to the nutritionist who was failing to fix this problem. Do we all have these organisms? On the MD and the alternative doc son practicing together=very smart. They can be creative with the billing and advice, as needed. It is a shame our healthcare does not have more of a place for alternative docs but I do believe that time is going to come; I don't know if I will be here to see it but I think it is coming! That was pretty cool, also, on the chickens. I told a friend the other night about you and how you grow everything and alerted me to the idea that dandelions can be consumed! I also told him how you can raise chickens, for consumption, in less than 3 months. I find your holistic approach to consumption enthralling!  Seriously. One guy I was engaged to was Sicilian. When he used to go visit his great grandmother in Italy when he was around 8-10 yrs old, she had him cut the head off the chickens! He was particularly fond of that!  Did I mention I left him!?  Can you imagine me being with a guy that found joy in cutting the heads off of chickens and watching their bodies keep going?! Lady: I love your avatar! So indicative of the season!! Speaking of flowers, a friend stopped by recently and saw these pretty flowers that are showing up on my lawn. I have **no** clue where these came from but they are pretty and smell great! My friend told me it is the work of the squirrels!!!!!! She said they think it is food and they bury the seeds! I have been looking around the neighborhood to try to figure out from whose lawn these seeds have been absconded by those lovely, little industrious squirrels! I am amazed that the squirrels have done this! They also have taken over my shed and made a semi-permanent home of my mower bag! I don't care as I love all animals. I also have groundhogs at the edge of the yard and I love them too! They look like little pieces of carpet running across the grass. Of course my neighbor would like them gone because overly concerned with his garden! One planet, one love! My grandmother on my mother's side was supposed to stay in Ireland and become a dentist but decided to come to the states instead. Much like your mother, my grandmother who actually became a chef and worked at Yale, would forever lament the choice of coming here and not becoming a dentist. She went back to Ireland the British Isles every year and did most of this by herself as my grandfather died some 25 years before her. At least the divorce is getting to the point of being finalized. I am sure it is bittersweet, however. I am just glad you are in good health, going to Zumba and planting flowers etc... and you know what, Lady? There is someone out there for you and not so much to marry but just to spend time with. If you want a companion, they will materialize! Just focus on it ;) My mother had a great lady that worked for her after she retired from a great job at B of A.  Her 1st husband died young so she was a single mom for many years.  She put her daughter through Wharton and finally, in her 60s, found a new love.  Still, some 15yrs later, they are still unmarried but together.  Keep the faith ;)  Congrats on your tattoos! Best of luck with that- Well, be sure to watch CNN as I have to go to Walmart!!!!!! I really hate going to Walmart but that is the only place that has my cats all natural litter as the other store ran out! For those of you who have cats, the clump litters are bad for them as the same ingredients that clumps their urine will also clump fluids in their bodies. Of course, the litter gets in their bodies as a result of their fastidiousness! Hope you all have a good weekend-",

Nice weather today, again!  Much needed rain this weekend, however.  Tex: you never know how all of these trials are going to play out and eventually if it works with the lower stages, I am sure it is going to be applied to the later stages as well.  It is entirely feasible, as I sew together all these pieces of news, we very well might have a \"vaccine\" of some sort, for all of us to use, before bc has any more impact on our lives.  I think it is all very exciting news.  Think about it: what we once thought might be our end might turn into something that is treated more like a flu and that with which we must just live with.  I just think all of these strides are amazing and every little development is a building block of hope and that is exactly the way I see it. Sptmm: I know, in it's trials, it is not for HER2- but it was intimated it would be rolled out to all early stage bcs if approved. One onc told me they are looking at HER2 status differently now and in some way this makes treatment approaches more universal.  I forget exactly what he said and, to be honest, he was trying to make up for having told me he was going to put me on TCH chemo!!!!  Whacko!  This was the guy I saw before I went to Yale.  When he ever said herceptin I was like \"excuse me?\" and he started to stammer and then went on some diatribe about how HER2 status is being treated differently etc...  In any case, like I told Tex, every little development is a huge ray of hope for all of us because, if you think about it, once they solve HER2 low and neu, surely that will lead to developments for us.  I find it all exciting as well as fascinating! Ginger: I think all the news is great.  We can all be excited about new meds.  Can you imagine if they actually not necessarily cure cancer but come up with a vaccine that moves it to a treatable status?  It seems to me with the little news bits I have picked up over the past 6 months and shared with you all, and although each one does not mean everything to all of us/apply to everyone of us/matter to each of us at all, collectively considered I like to think we are on the precipice of something big and learning much more about cancer.    I think Bush Sr called it \"a thousand points of light!!!!\"  That is the way I feel about every little development and even if bc eventually takes my container, I think the times we are in are going to be regarded as special and precipitous. I hope everyone has a lovely weekend!  I am looking forward to doing a bit of yoga and reading.  It is going to rain most of the weekend.   The Irish in me adores the rainy days! Happy trails- ",

I have been traveling but it is really nice when the entire trip is a GIFT! Just found that out this weekend, too. Of course, surgery Jane over here is not going to be able to do anything this summer (and, suffice it to say, I **do not** do the islands in the summer!!) but will be looking forward to this trip hopefully in October. Ginger: I periodically \"thread kill,\" not you!!!!! I make some wild, off-putting comment, rendering silence!!!! Night terrors...only heard about it. Never knew anyone that actually had them. It is awful they run in families. What a shame. Your poor dgd. The last guy I was engaged to told me I talk, in a rather spooky voice, in my sleep! Of course, he was such a jealous freak-of-nature, he tried to \"pump\" me for information about this cheating (in his mind!) that I was doing!!!!! Seriously, after dealing with him full-time, I had no energy for cheating! In any case, I know I still do \"spooky voice\" periodically as my cat will lay on top of me! It is when I am stressed like nowadays as bc is just a bit stressful! Texas: I am very much looking forward to hearing your results. Fingers crossed, woman ;) Calamtykel: did your son complete the assignment?  Did he gather enough subjects?  If not, I will help him.  Just PM me.  I am so enthralled as my Skecher Speciate mules just arrived!!!!!! Been wanting to get these things for 2 years but did not find my size or just forgot about it. Finally, they have arrived! So excited!!!! Happy trails, girls!",

Tex: It is my most ardent hope you get yourself into a few promising Stage 3 and/or 4 trials. In working on Wall St, I traded pharma stocks like a banshee! More to this point, I loved a good \"little known\" play which invariably was some esoteric pharma and when it hit stage 4 trials, I would almost definitely sell out my positions. Of course, reason being, by the time they hit 4 they are very close to FDA. They also know something quite definitive about the drug by the time it hit those stages in trialing. Of course this is not to say 1 & 2s are not good as well; clearly a 3 or 4 had to start somewhere! I just spoke to the onco nurse and she gave me a new link: www.oncolink.org. She said there are numerous trials there and it is a comprehensive list.  She also gave me a link for the national cancer institute, as follows: www.cancer.gov/ The national, of course, might be better for you. I am really glad I found that website. It is so comprehensive. There are so many trials in the tristate area, it is amazing. I hope you find a few that match you even if you had to travel north or to OK to CTCA or even elsewhere in TX. I saw at least a handful that were for Anderson. My bad on the MSK trial! I was scrambling yesterday to try to find you some options. I am so impressed with the fact that \"they will call you back within 1 hour\" has turned into 1 day and still no call!!!!!!! Oh, I never answered your question about how I found that link where it shows what we all do on this thread! If you google your screen name for this site, it will bring you right to this thread and everything else associated with your screen name elsewhere in cyberland! Ginger: I saw you on the pet thread. I don't know how me, probably one of the biggest pet lovers in the world, missed that thread! I just read, not posting. I am leaving a lot of my estate to the ASPCA and It is my hope cancer does not eat much more of that! As for Crickett, you guys remember I worked in marketing in wireless before cancer, right? In any case, Crickett is ok in some outlying areas but like hotly contested markets like in the Northeast and in all metropolitan centers in this country, not so much. Even though $40/month, triple unlimited sounds good, for most of us that dream cannot be had without much \"hello, hello?!\"  Well, off to run errands!  Hope you all have some good weather this weekend.  In the Northeast April showers turned into the dryest April we have ever had filled with brush fires and now we are having May showers.  It is what it is, girls, it is what it is!  ",

I was all set to go to my friend's annual party! I am a complete mess if there ever was one! Timothea: those are lovely pictures! I really like the one of your dd with her hair stuck in the zipper! She looks just fabulous! Nice photos! Nice one of the deer. When I lived on the beach I saw deer \"on the beach!\" It was the strangest thing ever. I understand all the over-population etc... but it was just something I had never seen before. You all look like you were having one heck of a good time and that is a great tent. So many people nearly give stuff away on CL so I am glad you were able to benefit  Calamtykel: have not heard from you in a while but I thought I would post an \"Amazon\" warning! Someone purchased a netbook almost 4 months ago. She wanted her money back and filed some A to Z claim with Amazon and not only did she get her money back, she does NOT have to return the computer! Un-EFFING-believable. I am so stunned, I cannot tell you. How the hell could someone buy used electronics and get their money 4 months later (Best Buy would not even do that) AND also not have to return the item? It is beyond me so for all of you out there who want to buy something on Amazon and get away with saying it is damaged thereby getting your money back AND being able to keep the item, you know you can do that now: it is called an AZ guarantee. I will never, ever again sell anything on Amazon, Ebay or the like. I will BUY because all transactions are heavily tilted in favor of the buyers. It is egregious. These buyers that know how to play the game can get away with everything on those sites. Ginger: there is nothing wrong with complaining and do you know how much I hate that \"well, your lucky to be here\" crap, I can't even put it into words. It is such a joke how much this disease robs from us, living in this crappy country with their ridiculous lack of healthcare control, insurance companies kicking us around, not being able to buy insurance in the open market after you lose your private insurance and/or your job and for this we are all supposed to be enthralled to just be alive?!?!? Seriously, that is some fuzzy math! If you look old and you don't like it, you have every right to talk about it and certainly to not be reminded you are so effing lucky to be here! That is just the stupidest thing to say to someone going through this bc battle.  I am telling you, I am going to start fighting on behalf of all victims soon enough. I am tired of this crap. My doc gave me some talk about AIs and took a menopause panel to find out if I am truly there and if I need to switch meds.  It was also suggested when I have a lengthy surgery I should OFF Tamoxifen b/c it causes clotting!!  Do you know I had no clue why women kept talking about going off Tamox for big surgeries.  No clue it caused clotting and with all my surgeries, NONE Of my docs ever told me that...wth is going on out there?   I am getting so much pain under my left arm, it is scaring the ___ out of me. I can't feel lymph nodes swollen but what the hell would I be feeling as they took the lymph nodes, 18 to be exact, from there and the sentinel as well as 1 other was cancerous. By now they should have the equivalent of a car-wash size non-radiation scanner that they can send us through to find out what is going on with this damn disease. MRI was mentioned on me as I am also getting pain up and down my left arm and losing feeling in my hand and my entire arm at times.  It is incomprehensible what we go through.  I want every day to put this *&^%$ *&&^%$ (you all decide what words you want to insert!) behind me but it just keeps creeping back in. Also, and for all of you who have dealt with doctors WHO SUCK, I am going to start and thread and/or a website where you can go to tell your story.  I don't care what they have you sign that says you can't talk bad about them because anonymity is a virtue ;) There is no need for women with breast cancer to be treated anything less than with respect and concern for their awful condition and I am sick and tired of these doctors and I am making a list! The Pink Brigade is on!!!!!! We are going to tell our stories and the doctors that give a crap and do the right thing will get the patients and those that do not can go to H-E- double hockey sticks!! I am telling you now, the time has come! History is in the making. I am going to go celebrate Memorial Day!!!!!! He he he!!! Hope you all are having a good weekend",

I heard something really interesting last night on CNN while watching Fareed Zakaria interview a doctor about this prostate cancer screening development. He said *some* of the cancers found in the prostate are \"innocuous\" and should be left alone as they will not become life-threatening. It got me to thinking how more people are dying of cancer so it is the txs or the cancer? Is a little cancer in everyone ok/healthy? I had never heard a doctor speak of cancer *and* use the word innocuous. Is it better screening or what the medical industrial complex is doing about cancer that is causing so many deaths? Were people really dying of undetected cancers before all this screening? It certainly is something to reflect upon and that which, most likely, will never garner a definitive answer. I guess I just wonder if they are using all this screening as a way to \"hunt up\" reasons to treat but, of course, I do also see the value in screening etc...  Chicken or the egg, man?!  Tex: no, I knew exactly what the car ins co was up to and like an idiot, I called just because I prefer to suffer! Of course the story goes \"everyone\" in my zip code has gone mad and they are driving like wild animals so we all must kick in a few extra bucks!!!  I knew it as that is always the story they use for these little, tiny increases. There is never a decrease, however. Never. In any case, they really castigated me, replete with a heavy dose of automobile insurance vernacular, concerning how my policy only went up by $2! They gave me a discount elsewhere. The last time I had an accident: over 20 years ago. The last time I made a claim: over 20 years ago. The last time I had a point on my license: over 20 years ago (thanks to my lawyer killing speeding tickets...he he he!!). It really is pure robbery however, plain and simple. They told me if I add a 3rd car what a discount I will be getting....gee, thanks! Their capitalistic dreams just might be coming true, however! Do you have chemo every Monday? Iowa: good for you, stay busy! The healthiest reason for not being here is moving on and putting it behind you. Have a good summer. Nice pic-you look great! Well, I hope you all have a good day.

Also, when you research \"collective farming\" it is often portrayed as being prevalent in a number of other countries but the US is never mentioned. Sure enough it is happening here but they just don't call it that. They tell the farmers what to plant and when. My mother was very upset about the grain stores and how all of that food is left, often times to rot, so they can better control the commodities market meanwhile people are dying all over the world and could benefit from that food. It is all about profit before principles and it is a travesty at that. I will check out that article and thanks for letting me know. So tired! I hope everyone has a good night.

      "Content": "Jul 3, 2012 03:17AM - edited Jul 3, 2012 03:26AM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! Is it just me or have our weather cycles, wild fires, tornaodes etc.... all become much more volatile in recent years?  Yesterday, the storm that knocked out my power for the first time in many years, involved hail, big hail at that.  Things are getting crazy! Calamtykel: In the early 1900s in this country, \"socialized medicine,\" which in and of itself does not mean anything, was not villified.  It was being held that with it we could discover disease in the early stages and treat the masses, would make a contribution to social healthcare etc...   However, by the 1930s, when \"socialism\" and \"communism\" became inseperable words, it was villified.  The reason we don't have it is largely political.  The AMA is the second, and largest reason, we don't have \"social\" healthcare even though when they started beating that drum, \"socialized\" medicine was alive and kicking in other countries for many successful moons.  While Teddy Roosevelt, FDR and Harry Truman all were in favor of socialized med, the AMA went berserk with a campaign to STOP it in it's tracks.  They even went this far:  Government involvement in health care was ardently opposed by the AMA which distributed posters to doctors with slogans such as \"Socialized medicine ... will undermine the democratic form of government.\"[27] According to T.R. Reid (The Healing of America, 2009): \"The term ['socialized medicine'] was popularized by a public relations firm working for the American Medical Association in 1947 to disparage President Truman's proposal for a national health care system. It was a label, at the dawn of the cold war, meant to suggest that anybody advocating universal access to health care must be a communist. And the phrase has retained its political power for six decades.\"[8][9] The AMA conducted a nationwide campaign called Operation Coffee Cup during the late 1950s and early 1960s in opposition to the Democrats' plans to extend Social Security to include health insurance for the elderly, later known as Medicare. As part of the plan, doctors' wives would organize coffee meetings in an attempt to convince acquaintances to write letters to Congress opposing the program.[28] In 1961, Ronald Reagan recorded a disc entitled Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine exhorting its audience to abhor the \"dangers\" which socialized medicine could bring. The recording was widely played at Operation Coffee Cup meetings.[28] Other pressure groups began to extend the definition from state managed health care to any form of state finance in health care.[citation needed] President Dwight Eisenhower opposed plans to expand government role in healthcare during his time in office.[22] The AMA knew they would not make so much money if medical went socialized so it decided to connect it to the cold war and communism.  As my favorite shark on \"Shark Tank\" says, it is always about money, all of the time.  Our country continued to wallow in capitalistic, war mongering tendencies, which we kind of had to, and now, after putting numbers that aren't even fathomable into fighting \"communism,\" and with the dismantling of communism in the USSR, the word communism is no longer so dirty and awful.  The AMA capitalized on what was a hot button issue to support, grow and promote their dubious agenda. There is not even enough space on this server for this site to explain why we can't \"just adopt\" the Canadian or Australian systems!  It is all the way our tax dollars are spent.  Also, you must remember, many people over 100K are already in the 43% overall tax bracket.  Yes, perhaps they have write-offs to drive it down but the bottom line is we need to be able to basically double taxes to make a socialized system of med work. Last week a congressman from SC, who btw have the highest number of uninsured in the union. was espousing against Obamacare until he went pale when confronted with the very dismal numbers in his own state.  He started going on about how people are waiting in lines in CA and the UK to get procedures (which is pure propoganda) and the interviewer said \"you do realize there is something out there called the internet and a search engine called google, right?!!!\"  He did not know what to say.  Of course, before the internet they could tell us these stories and we would believe it.  Our Canadian friends here are doing just fine as are a few others I have met her from Scotland and Ireland. Elective surgeries, sure, there might be a wait but how many people \"elect\" surgeries?! Before cancer, the last time I saw the inside of a hospital I was 17 getting a tonsilectomy! Then there is the cancer and the financial part we all know too well.  People like us could not buy insurance in the open market and are basically fiscally castigated for doing nothing wrong.  That is a system that sucks; that is our current system.  People cannot walk our streets sick, walking into hospitals looking for $100K in free care.  We need to manage that.  From a cost and tax perspective, it is going to take a wicked long time for us to get to the point where there are no more out-of-pocket deductibles, crazy copays etc... and just get to a point where care is truly managed, as it is in every other civilized country on the planet, and where we pay not with losing our homes and blowing through our 401s to subsidize our own egregious healthcare costs in this abysmally unworkable system, but rather through taxes, and yes, the taxes will be high.  Before I had cancer, I was ready to pay and now that I have cancer, I am still ready to pay.  I don't like the fact that we are tied to companies because of benefits.  That sucks.   Pres Clinton implemented COBRA.  FDR implemented Social, Margaret Thatcher was a huge proponent of socialized med and she saw England through it's worst economic malaise in history and finally President Johnson, expanding on FDRs social security, signed Medicare into law.  Great people and great presidents have long encouraged such a system and these people are remembered for their work in protecting the masses. If you research the veins of strong opposition, it leads to the purse strings always and forever.  It never leads to a concern for humanity.  This is where civilized and capitalism have their duel.    The AMA no longer has it's war horse \"communism\" to roll out so the dastardly scramble has begun so they can protect profits.  It does seem they are losing this battle and finally, at long last, the American people might win.  Maybe not in our lifetimes but the best thing that happened was the end of the cold war as it was fundamentally and intrinsically tantamount to a move toward healthcare for all. I am getting off my soap box!!!!!!!  If you set me off to do research, that is exactly what I will do, however! Good day, all- ",

She agreed that she is picking up on my stress over impending surgery. She also said rescue cats and dogs, once they bond, establish such a close connection, it might even be different than any other pet I have had. I guess what is on my mind about this surgery is while the masses are in my chest, I can speculate but with them being removed and sent to pathology, combined with other factors, the time is coming when I will get a final answer on just what they are. When it comes to cancer, it is almost nicer and more comforting NOT to know!! I know you all understand this. Tex: we can definitely do a Thursday night; that is not a problem. I am thinking August 9th right now and perhaps around 7:30 or so. I will post more definitive information in the coming weeks. As for that study, in retrospect I realize it was probably a bunch of guys in a lab, fully exploring their Oedipal desires and deciding to study large breasted women! I guess I was sleeping on that one! The Couch to 5K update: Tomorrow starts week 3 but, in fact, I will have to repeat week 2 :(  I am actually doing this mainly because I really want to be in as good shape as possible going into surgery. I also do want to run. There is a Thanksgiving Day run that I would like to do but with surgery interrupting my progress, my best goal is the Revlon in May and then the Thanksgiving Day run in 2013.  What's more, however, is I am finding I am wicked out of shape for running! For this reason, I have to repeat week 2 to not only get my times under control but also to get comfortable with those times. I do believe I might be repeating week 2 three times! Does anyone else feel compelled to watch every comedy that includes Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller?! I must go see \"The Watch.\" That looks hysterical! Iowa: just today I was leaving the grocery store and one of these \"Green Party\" folks stopped me and wanted me to sign petition blah blah... In any case, he said \"do you like the weather?\" I said yes, of course and a few degrees warmer might make me even happier! He was dying in the heat. You know, hot as it is, this is *summer* and I remember January all too well so perhaps your ride was hot but that is better than freezing! Sounds like a good time...even though I am not into bikes esp when 5 people I knew were killed on them...kind of changes your mind about bikes. Plus my friend, who is like 53, dropped her bike and busted up her ankle pretty good and now has pins etc.. in her ankle. Yeah, bikes are not for me! I might get a Honda Ruckus for city riding only!  I can hear you now, Sue, saying \"does she think she can't get hurt on a scooter on a city street?!?!?\"  You are right!  I hope everyone is having a good weekend.

I hope you all are finding a little peace and tranquility today.  Also, don't forget to smile at yourselves in the mirror...it works!    Calamtykel: Kel, I totally know how you feel. My pet, done 6 mos ago, was above that 2.0 - 3.0 range, I get stabbing pains under my arm and all kinds of pains in the breast pocket....this disease scares the shit out of everybody. I wish CKPTRY was on as I think she could offer more perspective on the tumor markers. I know, as Tex pointed out, not only are they not taught but many, many hospitals etc... don't use them. That is a pretty narrow deviation also. Sending you positive vibes, Kel. I am just so happy they are sending you for scans. My friend at MSK did not fare so well. At least someone is paying attention to what is going on with you. What scans are you getting? Are you getting a PET? I think you are a good candidate for a PET. Kel, we are all here for you. Don't worry until you get the results. I hope all turns out just fine. Also, on sleep apnea (thanks for telling us about this, Kel), if any of you are snorers or don't seem to get fitful sleep etc.., get checked out. Have a sleep study. The connection between developing of a new cancer and the proliferation of an existing cancer for those with undiagnosed sleep apnea is becoming more and more evident. I just read 2 studies a few nights ago and there was also a piece on the CBS evening news about it. Serious stuff. I can't believe that sleep apnea can cause cancer. Scary. Tex: I will be honest about that Obamacare business! Bottom line- if you have had catastrophic health event the *only* way you can get insurance in the United States is through marriage or your job, period!!!! A very close gay friend of mine and I have been talking \"partnership\" for the purposes of healthcare and tax advantage! Not joking! Honestly, that is my kind of marriage! He does his thing, I do mine and we shop together! Very good times, indeed!!! The other option is If I actually date someone I like enough to hang out with them for a while, and they have a \"really\" good job, the potential to be added to their plan as \"domestic partners\" is also an option but I could never lock myself in a situation like that for benefits!!! Ugh, if I don't marry my gay friend, I think I would prefer to suck the corporate umbilical cord OR move to Ireland before I get locked into some relationship that my healthcare is contingent on! Well, I can actually buy CT state insurance which no doctors accept for the bargain price of $400-$500 per month!! What it does do, however, is cost me a lot of money and give me coverage that will get me not quite so kicked around (as I would be without it) should I reach critical mass and head to the ER!!!! Ok, everybody, I have my guitar and I am going to start off on Springsteen's \"Born in the USA\" and hope you all sing from all your corners of this wonderful world! I am going to change the lyrics and post the altered version here for bc patients and the like! OMG...I just heard on CBS news that women can reduce bc risks by breast feeding?! Kel, you have 4, right? I think you might have breast fed...where do they come up with this crap? It is frustrating that of the millions who have been stricken, they find 100 that had kids and did not breast feed and they call it a stat now. I had to go off Tamox pre-surgery and now am getting pains in my stomach like that menstrual madness is trying to get started. Could that be possible? Ugh....don't want that back AT ALL! Don't need it, don't want it! Well, Kel, I wanted to get on and let you know I am thinking of you pre-massive thunderstorms replete with the potential for tornadoes coming to a county near me soon! I do, however, think you sympathize as NJ is not getting spared either! One more song for the day: Bobby McFerrin's \"Don't Worry Be Happy!!!\" I am not changing the lyrics on this one! Timothea, a link for you so as to familiarize yourself with what should be our collective anthem! www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU A very good friend had just gotten his trust fund and it was 1988; we did things that I will take to my grave with me and it was all FUNTASTIC!!!! We had some really good times! Finally, last night I did a home exfoliator, one of my faves, and that which you all should try. Very easy- just sugar, sea salt and a enough olive oil to cover the sugar and sea salt.  A wonderful homemade exfoliator and one that Lancome can never make for me!  Kel, keep your chin up.  We walk this road together- ",

      "Content": "Jul 24, 2012 05:33PM - edited Jul 24, 2012 05:41PM by 1WonderWoman Rachel: I think all my years working on Wall St, working 8AM to 7PMish, I am fiercely business minded almost to a fault and I loved working that hard and the pace was just right for me. I was just telling my friend at lunch a few days ago that when I am watching a sitcom etc... and they are screwing around in the office like \"Parks and Rec\" had a episode where they were having a water balloon fight, all I can think is they are wasting time and money!  Not joking...I even go as far as to calculate how much longer they could go on like that before all that time, and thereby money, wasting would lead to going out of business(except that Parks and Rec is based on municipal workers!).  I love a very fast paced work environment and have to constantly be productive.  I don't even feel right if I feel I have not worked hard that day.  Just the way I am wired. For these reasons, I don't really get on Twitter and FB to chat with friends although there are a few I talk to. Twitter for me is more business, like stocks, financial, some Japanese sites as I do speak it and like to encourage my remembering the characters (can't read enough characters to read a newspaper however!), politics, baseball, law schools, news, Bloomberg and a number of celebrities I like. I really get on it to have some fun and check out new developments in cancer research etc..., baseball and business. I guess I use Twitter a lot like you do but not when I am bored. I really like Twitter. FB for your purposes is excellent esp w/family overseas. I am so sorry to hear about your friend from the support group. It is very sad. A friend has had brain cancer for many, many years. He is treated at MSK and has been ok for many years. I don't understand it all. It is sad. I am sorry you have to go through that. My friend at MSK died last week. Some people have an organized cancer management system that is without crisis and issues. Mine, however, has been replete with problems and it makes me nervous that so much time has been spent dealing with bs that the pain I am getting under my left arm and the constant itching, not to mention the continued numbness, is leading up to something that perhaps will not be found until after this next surgery. It is all so scary. You don't know what to do first. My friend that passed had a sort of convoluted trajectory as well. We spoke of this rather often. Like I said to Tex, we all are celebrating 2 years since dx and may we all celebrate many more. As for the shooting, in Connecticut there is a shooting almost every day and we probably average at least 4 homicides per month.  Just last night a preacher was in line at Burger King, got into an argument with someone and they just pulled out a gun and shot him dead.  As for guns, a friend just moved about 20 minutes outside Nashville. I asked her about crime and she said it was pretty darn low because \"everyone\" is packing!  I can only imagine whacko would not have marched into that theater in Colorado if he felt that 75%+ of the audience might be carrying guns.  The whole topic is just a mess.  Well, the love of my life, Dr. Oz(!!!) had yet another fantastic episode and I am going to give you all a luscious immunity-boosting, one pot soup by Ming Tsai (famous for his soups) but of course it contains tofu. I am going to reflect on replacing it. In any case, here goes: Ingredients: Hot and Sour soup Serves 4 1 tbsp grapeseed oil 1 jalapeño, minced with seeds 1 tbsp minced ginger 1 tbsp minced garlic 2 bunches scallions, green and white parts sliced, 2 tbsp greens reserved 1 lb shiitakes, stems removed and tops 1/4-in sliced 2 1/2 quarts chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth 2 tbsp naturally brewed soy sauce Juice and zest of 2 lemons 1 block silken tofu, cut into 1/2-inch cubes 2 cups shredded carrots Freshly cracked black pepper Directions In a stockpot over medium-high heat, add oil and swirl to coat the bottom. Add jalapeño, ginger, garlic and scallions. Sauté until aromatic, about a minute. Add shiitakes and sauté 2 minutes, until softened. Add stock and soy sauce, bring to a simmer and reduce by 20%, about 5 minutes. Add lemon juice, tofu and carrots and cook gently for 2 more minutes to heat tofu through. Season with black pepper. Ladle soup into serving bowls and garnish with reserved scallion greens and lemon zest ENJOY!!!  ",

      "Content": "Aug 25, 2012 09:42AM - edited Aug 26, 2012 03:11AM by 1WonderWoman Good evening, warriors! What a week your fearless leader has had!!! The pooling fluid continued to pool and then just kept getting worse so off to the ER I went to be admitted, and I was, on Tuesday night. What a process. I must say, however, that the ER itself and the process by which they handle their human traffic has gotten better as the last time I went to the ER, some 7 years ago, I was waiting in line behind a man with a gunshot wound! We were numbers 4 & 5 respectively in line! In any case, I had gotten an ultra on Monday which showed the fluid pooling. After being in the hospital for 24 hours the only thing they accomplished was doing yet another ultrasound. They also admitted me into the \"general population\" hospital and not the cancer hospital. Great- so now I was laying there with 7 open holes in my body in the main hospital and my drain implementation had been moved from an OR procedure to a \"step down\" unit procedure. The \"step down unit does smaller surgeries and largely on an outpatient basis. After being in the hospital, secretly worrying about MRSA and all that other crap floating around and with my compromised immune system, pooling fluid and open wounds, they announced they would not be doing the procedure and wanted me in another day. NO!!!! Going home now, thank you!!!!! I signed myself out and got it done today on an outpatient basis. Unbelievable. First off, it was not within my best interests, nor my insurance co, to have me lying around a hospital waiting for trouble to ensue when the procedure was an outpatient anyway. My final deciding factor was when a nurse came in and told me that it was entirely feasible I might stay in the hospital yet another day and the procedure \"still\" would not get done the next day!! In any case, this was my lovely week! I hope you all had a better one! Sweeney: when will you get bone scan results? Also, as for the Huffington link on my boy, Kim Jong, after much reflection I have come to the conclusion it was photoshopped! Rachel: 14 years?! Wow!!! I with one guy for over 3 years once!!!!!!! Whahahahahah! It was at some point I decided he commandeered the remote control way too much and, oh yeah, I could be less bored by myself!!! Variety is the spice of life is my mantra! I know this will be hard to believe but my brother and sister both married their HS sweethearts! And I am a committed rolling stone!  Lady: what a time they had with my veins. Of course, and I am sure most of you have this as well, b/c of LN removal I only have 1 arm from which to draw. While I was in for 24 hours they stabbed that arm 4 times not to mention the gargantuan surgery I had 3 weeks ago and the stabs during that week and now my arm is pretty swollen and bruised. Today for the outpatient procedure they had quite a time. No wonder as first off my appetite is not back at all, they had me on no food or drink for 24 hours while I was in the hospital, I had not eaten much of anything on Monday and then I had to go on no food or drink after midnight as of last night. I was stunned they were able to get any veins at all! The man they called in to help find a vein was such a kind, sweet man. All I can say is I am damn glad he was able to find a vein!  Someone sent him to me today!  Lady, I can't believe the villainous way you speak of my boy, Kim Jong!!! Perhaps they all had gas from eating corn \"dogs\" at the very frivolous amusement park! BTW, any word on the potential for the research position?  I believe you said his budget might not warrant such until 1st quarter next year but just thought I would check ;)  Sptmm: I am so happy for you that you are going to run the 10K!!!!! I don't know about me with these new knockers how well I will be able to run! My friend was with me in the hospital the other night making an eclectic mix of comments about them not to mention that I am going to end up with back issues! Jealousy!! Calamtykel: that is awful about your friend's mom. I can't believe they weaned her off pain meds and sent her home. Yes, all there remains is to hate this disease as there certainly is nothing to like about it. Omaz: that is such a beautiful pic!!!!! Just gorgeous! Nice sky! Rachel: glad you worked out the synthroid timing. They are most likely going to increase you at some point and it could take a while to get the dose correct. Also, do a bit of research on the \"parathyroid\" just in case they start talking about removing your now non-working thyroid. What I am trying to impart is sometimes it is just not worth it to let them take it out. Cancer is indeed ubiquitous. It seems everyone I talk to is talking about someone they know who has it somewhere. It is becoming a modern day plague. Good luck with the scans next week. Good vibes, woman! Well, I have recently been reminded on several occasions now how much men like breasts! For the past 2 years, with my non-boob status, I had totally forgotten how much attention these jokers garner! Of course, with my lovely post-surgical garb and my \"stomach is full of fluid\" gate, it is absolutely no wonder why I am getting this attention(thanks boobs)!  It is so ridiculous!   Yankees--- a very good friend gave me very good seats that I had to let go b/c of all my surgery fun! Will my life ever be normal again?! All this typing has made me tired...nap time!!!!!!!! I really should go try to eat something but my appetite is still saying no! Happy trails and wishes for a good weekend, girls!",

Of course with my gross leg clot bag I am not going out to enjoy my usual fest of liquid fun and the subsequent bad decisions that go along with such activities but the weather is nice so for this I am grateful! A friend has an annual party and I usually attend but with my luck some rabid animal will jump out of the bushes and attack my gross drain bag!! Also don't want to wear long pants and hide it so whatever! Have to forego fun. There is a touch of cool in the air that is making me not too happy! I am watching \"House Hunters\" and (Calamtykel) they are Tybee Island, GA which, as some of you might recall, is one of my fav, and unspoiled, vaca spots. All I know is it is warm there....not looking forward to winter! Sptmm: your hip problem is most likely coming from running. It is an overuse injury and you just have to deal. Mobic might help and it is not necessary you take it every day but rather just when you run. As soon as I started training for the Couch my Achilles started really complaining. I think they call these pains \"the price we pay\" for the joy of running!!! Deb, GYM RAT is the best life ever!!  Also, those \"mosh up\" classes are the best!!! I love them. Port Chester Bally's used to do such a wicked step class, I was nothing short of addicted. Invariably, and definitely on holiday weekends, they would segue into a \"strength\" class and then follow that up with yoga. It was the best 3 hours in the gym EVER!!! Deb, you are killing me with all your gym talk! I am so desperate to get back to the gym, I am going berserk! I miss the gym like I can't even tell you. Speaking of holiday weekends, one Bally's in CT would do a 5K through such a bucolic state park trail and I loved it! I ate everything and anything I wanted on Thanksgiving as I started my day the right way!! Man, I totally miss being in great shape. BTW, if I win Mega Bazillions, I am flying over to the island to pick you up as we are going to go scouting properties in Westchester to build our DREAM fitness center and this also means you can quit both your jobs! I will toss some millions at the project and that includes hiring your for 10 years! I actually the entire gym mapped out and the whole plan in order. I know *exactly* what I would build. There was a great gym in my hometown when I was growing up. It had tennis courts (2), racquetball courts (5), indoor pool, sauna, steam, sauna in ladies locker room upper and lower levels, same in men's locker rooms, towel service, smaller pool for water aerobics, upper and lower cardio rooms, spin room, yoga studio, 2 class rooms, upper and lower free weight areas and a lounge! I love, love, loved that place! In fact when my partying in Manhattan would wear me out by weekend and I would come back to CT to \"dry out\" and get ready for the next week's antics (including 12 hour workdays!), I would look so forward to going to that gym even with being on the magic island with the likes of \"Planet Reebok\" and Bally's Vertical clubs. I just loved that fitness center. That is the kind of place I would build. Oh yeah, and there would be a separate rooms for abs and stretching! This is my dream, woman! One more thing about our gym, women and men will have their own separate whirlpools! I hope you had a blast at the gym! (I am so jealous!!) You know, I think I am going to write up a proposal to build this fitness center. I need to get moving on this. It is a long held dream and one that could be replicated, not necessarily franchised but established elsewhere. Your post totally energized me and I am so glad you have time off from both jobs. Deb, I did not know you have 2 jobs. I am going to have to get cooking on winning that Mega Bazillions so we can do what we love, get moving on buildling our flagship fitness center and you can dump BOTH jobs!! I hope everyone has a nice day!",

Ginger: now that you jogged my memory, I remember reading about Harry! Sorry! I distinctly remember reading about it b/c you spoke of a paddock. My father had paddock fencing along the front of his property, nearby the road. More about my memory, I saw a dear old friend a few days ago and she told me something about myself and I have zero recollection of this! I guess the memory is on its way out as well! I love fruit and have been hooked on green grapes lately. The only problem in CT is, and just like in \"Dodgeball (Deb!!!),\" they add a few pounds to the scales! I got 2 apples and according to the grocery store scale they weighed 1.5 lbs!!! Georgia is so well-known for their peaches but a friend who lived in SC for quite a while pointed out she always thought SC peaches were juicier than GA. The last time I went to the farmers market I was really disappointed that more than ½ of the vendors were selling prepared food which I can only imagine is to attract more patrons. I really go to the farmers market strictly for fresh produce. I am going to go to a few others this fall. The berry baskets sound just great and a nice price at that! Sptmm: OMG...your kids love \"Dodgeball?!\" Deb, that is one of my favorite movies ever! Yes, if you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball! I also love it when the \"manly\" girl from the brownie troop gets the team disqualified for using anabolic steroids!!! All the hair on her arms and that deep laugh! It is one of those movies that the more you watch, the more stuff you realize you missed! There are about 20 movies in that genre that I just love! Feel free to call me whenever you have a question! I am here and will most likely still be here, sitting that is with this lovely drain coming out of my stomach and that which is strapped to my leg! We will start that gym, Deb! It is a long-held dream of mine but I just can't retrofit some old building. I am such a poodle! I just really want it built in a brand new facility. I want to have a groundbreaking ceremony, Deb! As for the weather, I had to lay in an operating room, freezing earlier this week for 1.5 hours b/c the dr was tied up elsewhere. I have sciatica and laying flat on my back in that cold room for all that time got that thing going again. Normally I would do cobras and hamstring stretches but I cannot with this lovely drain in! In long, I opened all the windows but was not outside. I did, however, make sauce and meatballs, did some laundry and feel I was productive...as much as I could be! Deb, I miss yoga! HAPPY, HAPPY, HAPPY birthday to you, girl! Each one is more exciting than the previous for all of us! Very glad the GI was all clear! Good for you! Congrats on getting the go-ahead for surgery! WOOT WOOT! Texas: thinking of you! I know you are 100% busier than you used to be but just wanted you to know I am thinking of you ;) Between the sciatica business, my abdomen and this drain, I am in achesville! Going to hobble back to the sofa and watch some more HGTV! Night, all-",

I think she is tired of fielding calls from CT about how she is!! Totally hysterical that she can now call us! Calamtykel: sorry to hear about your friend's mom. It is absolutely farcical the nurses put her on a cardiac floor b/c of her racing heart when, in fact, she needed to be on a cancer floor enjoying pain management on her way out.  It is just sad but lucky for her an angel of mercy came to visit.  Because she was so uncomfortable it is just as well she never had to make that trip to hospice.  It is all still heartbreaking, however. Congratulations on your return to running!!! Must feel grrrrreat! Good for you. As for me, still have this drain hanging out of my stomach. Honestly, I am not even going to scare you all with the details anymore! Sweeney: any scan results? Well, I am going to go take some more antibiotics, eat some yogurt (to combat the perils of taking large doses of antibiotics!), have a banana to combat the potassium-reducing deleterious effects of lacex and then I am going to relax!

Sptmm: so funny that you bring up the \"man\" idea and breast size! Don't forget, I started with a female PS and the micro who joined the team is a man. He most likely did 90% of my flap surgery. At some point my orig female PS went out to the waiting room to give my sister an update and she mentioned to my sister something about \"she did not want them too big, right?\" and my sister confirmed that. Well, I believe it was too late as testosterone had alreaydy dictated my breast size! At this point there is no reason at all to bring up the fact that these things are large and with the male concern for massive breasts so pervasive, I just can't say anything at all! What's more is I opened my front door and FedEx was just about to ring my doorbell. Well, I was wearing a wife beater (NO, I would never wear such a thing out of the house!) as I was doing some cleaning and when I opened the front door it was to look to see if there was a package on the front porch and not to entertain that joker! He turned beat red and I was so embarrassed I couldn't sign quickly enough! I will be here for you as hou recover so feel free, woman! The surgery is so worth it, I can't even tell you. You know how much I think of my GP and how wonderful and supportive he has been through this whole process. Well I saw him yesterday and I completely admitted I thought very long and hard about the surgery, the duration and being under anesthesia all that time etc... but for me there was not one other option. I was not going with implants, MF grafting failed so this was my last and only option. I am just really glad I was able to do it and get it done. What I did to calm my mind was kept very busy coming up to that surgery. In this way I had not much time to think about it. In the end it was my best decision and I am wicked lucky the microvascular is as talented as he is. A few things to keep in mind: after day 5, when you leave the hospital, the chance for clotting goes way down and by about the 2 week mark, the risk of a clot goes to zero. One more thing: the further away from surgery you move, the risk for necrosis goes down until it becomes nearly non-existent. It is worth it, Deb. Recovery is rough but it is so worth it. The drain is in my stomach somewhat indefinitely now. I can't even wear normal pants. I live in sweat pants! So gross! Ckptry: that is wicked, wicked scary. It is just nerve-wracking constantly. I remember just before my father found out he had lung cancer telling me he had a cough he could not get rid of. All of the sudden tonight I started to get lightheaded and then this serious, kind of deep, cough developed but then went away. All I could think was \"brain, bones, liver, lungs\" and that was it. This disease makes us paranoid flakes! I am just glad you are ok. Scary, scary, scary. On the testicle note, my GP was telling me when husbands don't understand the wife's concern for recon he introduces them to the idea of testicle removal!!! I think that is hysterically analogous and sets them straight, of course!!! Happy trails to all and to all a good night! BTW, do you all realize Christmas is just about 12 weeks away?!!  he he he!!

Honestly, though, I am sort of ambivalent b/c as much as I said I wanted small, I don't think I would be happy if they were much smaller as I was never small to begin with!!! Geesh, I don't know, Deb- I just might be really uncomfortable in a world where men were NOT obsessed with breasts!!!! My GP used to joke with me about some show on TLC where the PS is always saying something like \"everyone gets DDs!!!\" I never saw the show but I found it pretty funny nonetheless and now I realize it is rather accurate! Felis: good to hear from you! Glad you stopped by. Just think, you are almost finished with chemo! That is milestone you will never forget. I lost my hair as well. I wore baseball caps a lot and because most of the time I was doing it was in the Fall to Winter months in CT, I wore a Peruvian hat constantly! That worked out really well because they are long enough in the back that one might have suspected I had a short hairdo as I did not lose lashes or brows. In any case, it comes raging back as soon as chemo is done ;) My onc told me to use Biotene all through chemo but b/c I am so hooked on original Listerine, I just kept using that. Biotene is another one that is good for dry mouth and that can also be what is causing the white marks in your mouth. I agree with Omaz, however, in that you should talk to your doc in case it is something that requires a prescription to fix. These weird things will most likely go away once done with chemo. Well my sciatica is **killing** me tonight so off to bed I go Happy trails, girls-",

      "Content": "Sep 26, 2012 07:30PM - edited Sep 26, 2012 07:36PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! I sure hope we don't have to go to war because I am down quite a few of you all!! I hope everyone is doing well and thinking about cancer less and less every day. I was at the hospital today and there was a young woman next to me who recently had a bmx. She was so miserable and petrified, it was scary. I was never that dark. I never took this disease too seriously nor did I take it to heart. For me the issue came down to a very definitive point: why would I? It is 100% out of my control and we have no idea from where it comes or where it goes (yes, this is \"Aerosmith\"-ish!!!) so I filed it in the \"whatever\" category. I was trying to talk to her and cheer her up and a few minutes in I realized I am pretty much reaching burn out on all things cancer. I am really tired of the whole damn thing!! This thread, however, is about chemo \"before, during and after\" so I hope we all still stop by to share updates on our \"after\" lives!! ******Sweeney******: any updates??!! I am very concerned and wondering what is going on with you. I would like to know how things are going and what, if any, conclusions they have drawn re: your bone scan hot spot. I hope things are going well. Rachel: have fun with that cross-border shopping! Reminds me of when I was 18, on my first \"no-parent\" vacation to Los Angeles. Well, of course it was very difficult to find a rental car agency for 18 year olds but we found it, drove to San Diego and then decided we wanted to go to Mexico. We remembered the rental joker telling us \"you can't take it to Mexico\" so we parked in border parking and walked across. One friend took a cab to Tijuana (whacko!) and my other friend and I stayed and did some \"cross-border\" shopping which fast turned to running across the pedestrian bridge at the border as we were being chased by about 5 Mexican men! Once we were on the other side, close to customs, we did a bit of border shopping off the pavement of the highway!!!! I hope your shopping is less risky and more fulfilling!!!!! It is just when you mentioned \"cross border\" it reminded me of my Mexican venture! I am sure your abdominal pains are nothing at all. It is so hard for me to remember that pre-bc I had tons of aches and pains that surely had nothing to do with crappy bc! I hope your thyroid med is working. It is a tricky thing to regulate. I met the loveliest woman walking to the parking garage at Yale a few weeks back who, at 71 (she looked *fab!*), got it removed b/c it was chock full of nodules. She was talking about coming up on the med and how she was feeling so much better. I hope you, too, are feeling better ;) Ginger: \"Wicked\" is the best!!!!! I am tempted to go to the Shubert to see \"Jersey Boys\" next week. I am more for repertory theater and off-Broadway but occasionally there are Bway shows that catch my attention. Right now friends in NYC are working on an off-Broadway production and, as I owe my friend a favor and he called it in, I have been doing a sound project for them. It is an intensely urban theme and so I have been using my \"rap\" collection to capture samples for them for the past few months. It is a fun project. I worked in theater for a few years when I was in college. It was fun and I met so many actors (Pacino, Robards, saw Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn do \"Love Letters,\" Berenger etc..) and I must say I enjoyed what were experimental stage productions of Michael Henry Brown at that time. Good stuff. My all time favorite was seeing Jessica and Hume do Love Letters, however! I had front row seats also! It was like I was on stage with them! Such good stuff! I hope your migraines go the heck away soon. One of my nurses, who is such a nice lady, suffers from those. A few weeks ago she was here and was so sick , I was worried about her making the ½ hour ride home. I hope you are feeling better. Felisa: be careful if you have a \"cold.\" You really need to let your onc know. There is some wicked respiratory/bronchitis going around here in the Northeast. When on chemo you have to take everything much more seriously. Glad you still have your nails ;) They might not go but rather will just turn a darker color. That happened with a few of mine. Hope you are feeling ok today. It is so hard for me to focus on typing AND Jeopardy!!!!!!! I absolutely love Jeopardy!  Alas I am trying to build up my ambidexterous coffers once again!! Happy trails, girls!",

Good to hear from some of you...was beginning to wonder in particular about my friend beavertail(Sweeney) up in Canada!!! Rachel: so glad to hear your MIL is stable. It really is so hard, I think, when you are in your own battle and you are seeing someone go through a time so much worse than your's was or that distance from the event has led you to believe your's was. I just hope you can stay strong and realize everyone's experience with cancer is different and we are all collectively doing better with each passing year. As per usual, I remain cautiously optimistic!! Family is great for providing support and I am glad this past Thanksgiving weekend reminded you of that. I am the baby and with my parents long gone, I don't really feel the \"family warmth\" much but I do miss it and am glad to know someone is enjoying such! Sptmm: nothing is going to go wrong! Step away from the keyboard and no more googling until November 10th-ish! They do this surgery on many women, present company included, that are in much worse shape than you so nothing is going to go wrong. Everything is going to go just fine and you will emerge stronger and feeling more confident about how you look. Just stay away from that research and pretty much keep your ears plugged because at any moment any person within earshot is bound to bring up the \"length\" of the surgery, scary stuff etc...! You don't need it! I am 9 weeks post surgery right now and I must say, it was a long recovery. I feel ok but definitely not back to normal. I am still awkwardly aware of the possibility of \"overdoing\" it which is antithetical to my very nature so this amounts to a daily struggle to do the right thing! You will be just fine, Deb. It definitely gets easier each week. Sweeney: well thank you for scaring the shit out of me!!!!!! Gadzooks...a woman can only take so much! I don't hear from you for weeks and my mind goes \"there!\" Thank you for reassuring me! Yes, it is all about me after all!!! That is so funny you talk about ham for Thanksgiving because I was just thinking the same thing today! This would, of course, make me a total pagan if nationalism was a religion but alas I will take my chances! Yeah, fun-sexy bc....WTF? Sorry but you all can say \"fig\" instead of what the F stands for but I am with you in that the stupidity irks me. I must say, though, the \"awareness\" part does make me happy as people who have all types of cancers lament the lack of \"awareness\" for their type. I just think the profiteering does upset me but then I see NFL players wearing pink socks and I just try to take it all in stride. A friend was just remarking at oil prices for home heating and how there should be \"some\" help for people like me who are single and entering year 3 of this battle. I explained the worst thing that happens is somewhere in the recesses of the societal mind there exist visions of women w/bc having the equivalent of ebit cards to some big benevolent account to help us through. Little do they realize much of it is smoke-in-mirrors except for the very destitute. Of course I write to you from capitalistic healthcare central!!! Like most things, some of it is good and some bad. One good aspect of \"pink\" month = I got slippers from a bc site for $6!!!!!!!  YAY!!!   Matt Damon was on a talk show discussing how he and his father, who battled cancer, are involved with a local charity in the Boston area which fundraises *STRICTLY* to offer financial support to those going through a cancer battle. What they offer is grocery and bill money to these people. Now THAT makes sense. I am going to look it up and get the name as that is a charity that I can get behind. Ckptry: I am in the process of doing what you have been telling me to do forever....!! I will PM you but I do think you might be proud!! I woke up the other day from a nap with such a pain in my collar bone. It was freaky and it actually felt like it might crack or something. Could remnants of chemo, could be mets but aside from those 2 possibilities, no clue as to why I would have a pain in my freakin bone and it was a vertical pain running through the bone? Oh well, guess it is scan time again. Here we go, girlies! It is just fine with me because I never lived with the illusion it was \"gone,\" that I am a \"survivor,\" nor that I \"beat it\" somehow! I might be able to knock it down but beyond that, you have to have a lot of faith and belief in supernatural benevolent forces to think you have annihilated it!! I am a little concerned anyway since I was never radiated, but I should have been, because of that infection. Oh well, time will tell. I hope everyone has a lovely night. My Yankees are doing well, tied with the birds in the ALDS! Tonight the Yanks are not playing so I shall devote my attn to \"The Voice!!\"",

Tex: You are baaaaaack!!!!!  YAY!  Good to hear from you.  Sounds like the cough might be an allergic reaction.  You are on so much crap, who knows?  I know my neighbor, when I was very young, would get that cough and feel like she could not breath when exposed to peanuts.  I also think chemo alters our chemistry so much, perhaps you have developed a new allergy?  You should also check the air conditioners for clean vents and to be sure that MOLD is not building up in there.   BTW, on the \"leakage,\" after that massive surgery and with all the drains, it was so hard to get up and go to the bathroom.   By the time I could get up and was heading there, a few times I had leakage.  I asked my nurses and she asked if I was doing my \"kegel\" exercises.  Apparently all women over 30 should be doing them to head-off leakage problems before they start.  I thought that was a new spin on that exercise.  Try those and hopefully, over time, that will help. Good to have you back, woman!  Missed you ;) Sweeney: definitely a Kleenex story!  The human spirit is amazing.  We are all so much better left to our own devices, our good spirit can actually shine through. A pink month positive...finally!  I called and was talking to a woman at a doctor's office I have not been to in quite some time (I know, hard to believe, right?!) and she told me JC Penney is giving haircuts for free to all bc girls this month!  It is actually the first \"benefit\" I have heard of during this pink month crap!  BTW, I never told you all how I know my ribbon was stolen off my car: on my way into the mall I looked at it for a moment, kind of reflecting on what it all means and when I came out it was gone!!!!!  If it fell off, it would have been on the ground! These Yankees have broken my heart!  On a much more positive note, I am sure glad our President showed up to the debate tonight!  I missed him during the first one! Good night, girls-",

Sptmm:  Your excellent physical condition is of concern to me when it comes to taking you on a NYC tour therefore I am in the process of buying a \u201cSegue\u201d so as to perform the tour at a pace congruent with what you are used to!!!!  I hope you understand!!!   On the hiking, sure, come on over!  Also check PMs for a way you can find a local hiking group\u2026although hiking on LI?!? Deb, your surgery is going to go just fine and I will be wishing you the best with every thread of my body on Tuesday right into Wednesday and will be thinking of you until I get that \u201cgot some new boobs\u201d text!! Felis: hang in there, girl.  Chemo will be over.  I know what you mean about people and how you might feel like they are not coming around because of what you are going through.  I don\u2019t know where you are located but you might want to see if there is a Cancer Support Community in your area.  Here is the link: http://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/Default.aspx BTW, this is not just \u201csmoke in mirrors\u201d but they actually do some good for cancer patients through these centers.   Something to consider. Cal: I have to say something here.  You have used this thread to advertise for \u201cbales of hay\u201d fundraising and you have advertised your \u201cstore\u201d on Ruby Lane 2 or 3 times now.  This thread is not for those purposes, I am sorry.  Also, please don\u2019t talk about slaughtering animals.  I am happy that you are so resourceful but these advertisings, fundraisings and now talk of slaughtering animals really have no place here at all.   As for the financial struggles, we *ALL* have taken a hit to one extent or another.   I am sorry things are so hard but following your \"Ruby Lane\" advertisement  with 2 paragraphs talking of financial struggles is making some people uncomfortable.  I am the only one, however, that took direct issue with the talk of slaughtering chickens so far.  I hope you understand, this is just not the place for that.  Please no more posts about your stores or local fundraising for \"pink\" bales of hay or anything to do with trying to evoke an exchange of funds of any type from this thread. I really don\u2019t even appreciate the fact I had to even say something but when people who come here to talk about bc struggles and their lives under the auspices of such a struggle, no one wants to be made to feel uncomfortable.  Ginger; if you want to shop at Calamtykels store, please PM her for more information.   I know you want to help. I hope you all have a lovely weekend! Happy trails-",

I can\u2019t believe they still care if I am alive or dead after how I aggravated them!  Some men just like it! When I was young, in the 70s(!!), we had a 3 TV household unlike me now, single w/7 TVS!!!  In any case, the only time I could find any peace was on Saturday morning, like 6ish, to get up and watch Saturday morning cartoons.  I was all of 5 or 6 and could easily get the milk out (my parents had it delivered so it was in small, kid size quart bottles!) and get myself a bowl of Crunchberries!  I am sure your kids can do that but what I suspect, however, is that you love them so much, you want to fix their meals for them ;)       Some shelters don\u2019t allow pets.  I found the one nearby me will accept pets.  I think it is ludicrous to expect people to leave their pets home although I also realize how easily managing them in a shelter could be a nightmare. As for the ticket, get a lawyer-it might cost you $150 or so but what they will do is go to court, whine that you are a perfect driver and the ticket will get nollied and you will have to make a charitable contribution.  IN a school zone on a phone---your insurance rate increase is going to cost you way more than $150! Sptmm: the way you meet a talk dark and handsome man in a storm is to not let him just jog by!!!!  Don\u2019t let those drains stop you!  I deeply suspect you are sending your mother to the store for supplies so you can head out for a little run yourself!  Deb, the post-surgery constipation b/c of the length of the surgery, was horrible. I did prune juice and they gave me some prescription.  It was horrifying and I feel for you! I am ok so far but my friend in Manhattan said Battery Park is going under!  He is in the E Village and will most likely not have to go anywhere but to his parents in Queens!  Meanwhile my friend from college who lives in Park Slope is worried about power outages and \u201clooting!\u201d  So said.  My friend in Philly is getting hammered right now.  You will never be ancient, girl!  You can run farther and longer than most of those 10th graders!!!

For once a friend from FL called to see how I was doing through the hurricane!  Usually other way around!  Still have lights, no downed trees so all is good!  It is all but over now. Felis: you have to fight through this. You can do it and like Deb said, failure is not an option.  It will be ok, you are almost done.  I know what you mean about being cold.  I went through chemo during the coldest months and there were some nights I had 3 comforters on the bed and then the hot flashes and I was going outside for air!   Because we go right from surgery into chemo, the breast can still hurt.  That might go on for a while.  Make sure you discuss this when you go for chemo.  I am still having some pain from the August surgery and that was not much longer than was the bmx.  The pain can linger but if it seems to you like it is odd or going on too long, say something.  You have to be your own advocate.  It is not like the drs will miss something but it is more like they are incapable of being in your body and knowing how you feel.  Iowa: thank you for your well-wishes to the E Coast chapter!  All good here and so glad we dodged that bullet. Tex: NO, it was not my friend!   That is scary that you learned on the news your BIL was shot.  I will never forget being 13 and watching the news in the AM before school.  We learned \u201con the news\u201d that our neighbor, who was 21 at the time, was killed by a drunk driver while he was out on his motorcycle early that morning.  It was so sad, I still get chills.  Finding out on the news something bad has happened to anyone we know is the worst possible way to learn of it.  I can still remember looking at his motorcycle lying on its side in the middle of the road. That pillow fight is all but guaranteed not to clean your house, girl!  Make a bigger mess is always the kids plan, isn\u2019t it?! Sptmm: that is just amazing that you lost that much weight!  That is a huge accomplishment and I wish I could say I was having such good success!  I just want to feel good again, less achy and more energy but I guess that is the national anthem for everyone over 40!! You know why you lost that weight? Because you worked very, very hard at it and I give you all the credit in the world.  Between your job and family responsibilities, and going through this bc battle, it is just amazing you were able to both lose all that weight and get to the point where you are running as far as you are.  It is such a personal statement, Deb.  A good, healthy commitment to working out will never, ever, ever let anyone down. Lady: thank you.  It was scary because the shoreline got hammered but those of us north of the I95 corridor fared ok.  Can\u2019t complain and am happy for that! I hope the NJ folks are ok.  NJ really got hit pretty hard so to Cal and Ckptry, we are thinking of you and hope you guys are ok. I am so glad tomorrow is less about cleaning up from the hurricane and more about getting other stuff done.  So glad the forecasters were not quite right this time. Sweet dreams to all and to all a good night! (can you tell I am getting in the Xmas spirit?!)",

This is insane.  Bloomberg announced the NYC Marathon will still go on as planned which is probably good but it is all just so overwhelming. The silver lining: there has been much talk about a new WPA to rebuild the infrastructure which is desperately needed. This, of course, would mean lots and lots of jobs.  We have to look at the power infrastructure and the entire infrastructure.  For any who have been to Newport, that grand seawall was built compliments of the WPA.   We need it again. Sptmm: I hope you are feeling ok.  I know what you mean about not wanting to take the pain pills knowing they are exacerbating the constipation.  Try pear juice also.  The stuff in the cans.  That is good to get you going also.  Also a nurse I met at CVS right after surgery turned me onto these cracker cookies called \u201cBelvita\u201d which are chock full of fiber. I hope you have had some success by now.  I am sure what you saw on the news today might have scared it out of you!  I am stunned.  In any case, hope you are better. Felis: we are here for you now and right through this entire event.  Just stick with us and remember this is going to get you to the next chapter in your life so you must embrace it for the life-saving and life-altering properties it has.  Remember that every time you don\u2019t feel so well and keep coming back here and let us know how you are.  Just hang in there; we have all been there and look at us all now!!! Tex: what is Tylenol 3? How are you feeling today?  Has that cough slowed at all?  Also, did you get your dr appt changed to the same time you get your biopsy results?  Finally is the hole where the tube was healing ok?   Sorry to ask so many questions!! I am just worried about everything with you and I am concerned about your results this week and regardless of what is going on, we know something is going on and I am concerned as to what you will have to go through to deal with this.  I am just looking forward to you not having to cough all the time anymore.  It does seriously hurt ab muscles after a while.   I hope you are doing better today and that you have everything squared away on one the same day this week.  Please keep me posted.  Let me know how you are. Sweeney: have a good trip!  Speaking of \u201ctripping,\u201d the news people reported this evening that 25% of the air traffic in this country  is in the Northeast exclusively-NJ, CT and NYC.  25% is a huge amount given the size of the country.  Well I am glad the NYSE is opening again tomorrow.  I cannot believe after years and years of never being closed in this past decade it has been closed for weather or terrorism more than in the previous 50 years combined.  Strange things are going on. NJ\u2014parts of that coast were just decimated.  I can\u2019t believe the carnage in Atlantic City and in Seaside Heights.   So sad but like Gov Christie said today mother nature fired a warning shot and we have to rebuild for today's climate and therefore rebuild smart.  Many of those homes were erected in the 50s and were very much in need of an overhaul.  Looking at Seaside rollercoaster in the ocean was just heartbreaking.  I know it is going to take years but I so look forward to seeing what the new Seaside will look like.  It is all so sad.  I have my memories of guido/gorilla juice head hunting in Seaside!  Well, time for me to do the crossword and go to bed!!! Night all-",

Lady: I was just watching Fox Sports Center and they were talking about how Alabama is an NFL caliber team!  This is the college football roundup I am watching now. Tex: there have been a number of mistakes with me since this whole saga started and one person in my \u201ccircle!\u201d is particularly litigious and always telling me how I should sue everyone and giving me attorney names and numbers.  I don\u2019t get into that.  The bottom line is I am still here, right?!  Also, b/c we are cancer patients, staying away from negativity and nonsense is the best thing we can do therefore getting involved with pointing fingers and assigning blame in a court of law, it is far more important to avoid all cesspools (people included) and relegate all that junk to the dustbin of history.  You are right, no worries, stuff happens, life goes on.   Perfectly eloquent way of summarizing this.   Avoiding all invitations into darkness, stress and people that are just mired in negativity is also very important.  I mean, yeah, it is our lives we are talking about but doctors are absolutely NOT infallible and even when they have messed up, I like to think they were trying NOT to mess up!  The docs that are doing good stuff have to pay enormous malpractice insurance premiums for all those devils that are just collecting money and it is a travesty.  Socialized med will get rid of the profiteers, albeit slowly, and we will end up with a much more healthy, far less litigious medical system. For now, however, I try to just assume everyone is trying to do their best.  It was very good of you to point out that although you are easygoing and forgiving, this is not a license to \u201cmess up your care!\u201d  Good point, Timothea!  Very good point indeed! I learn so much from you about how to just roll through this.  Your spirit is remarkable and this is why you keep rolling through it, onward and upward as they say ;)  As for the time management, the relationship with the doctor is paramount so you are right and just expect there are going to be delays.  My PS office is *the* best for time management.  I am totally serious when I say that I am barely sitting in the waiting room before I am called in to the office.   In fact, I don\u2019t think I have ever had to pay for more than 1 hour in the parking garage, they are that good.  More to this point, however, if they were not so great at time management, I would definitely not take issue b/c they are completely worth it.  I lucked out that they are both great surgeons and have a staff that easily handles manages their time well!   Hang in there, perhaps if you tell them about the travel time and the kids, they will be more accommodating.  I am just glad you have an oncologist that you like.  That is the most important relationship at your life at this minute along with that with your family and chosen deity ;) Rachel: you might just be being set up to rule the world!!!!!!  My gosh!  A new *department???!*  That is quite a feat, girl!   You seem to have much responsibility and they seem to like to lay it on you!  I know the traveling is a drag.  Even though I don\u2019t have a family, I would totally not relish a heavy travel schedule.  Travel for pleasure, yes, but for business, I am not really interested now mainly b/c post 9/11 I am no longer a good flyer and I seem to have develop claustrophobia.  Now the 3 hour intercontinental flights are quite enough for me!  Years ago it was ok.  For you, however, being on the \u201cglobal\u201d team in what sounds like a healthcare company is just a total honor.  I think that is just wonderful.  Healthcare management, with the burgeoning aging population, is an evolving challenge.  Great for you to be involved with that on the planetary level!!  Pretty cool! On the marathon, Bloomberg was **insane*** for even thinking about such. The marathon normally *starts* in Staten Island.  There was a manager from a Hilton on SI that was being interviewed last night.  He said he decided the people who have no homes were more important to house than were runners coming in for the marathon so he turned the runners away.  He was crying on the news last night when he said he got a call from the President of Hilton Garden telling him they were behind him 100% in the choice that he made to turn away the runners and also in all decisions surrounding this absolute disaster.  Old water works over here was crying with him!!! Sweeney: speaking of Canadian globe trotters, if memory serves, you skipped out to Ecuador just before the hurricane!!  Nice, really nice!!  Hope your trip is going well. Felis: I cannot believe what you are going through.  Dizzy, short of breath and knowing your rbc is low\u2026all very scary.  I hope they don\u2019t keep you at the hospital but if they do, most likely it would be just  overnight.  Please, when you get home, eat meat, nuts and all those things I listed to keep your rbc up through the end of txs.  Keep us posted and I sure hope after the blood transfusion that you will feel much better.  In fact, I am all but positive it is going to make you feel much better.  Hang in there, girl!  You are almost there ;) Well, I have to put away Halloween stuff that I took out very, very late anyway!  Normally, pre-bc, I would go to nursing homes in full costume as a volunteer.  Of course at night I would normally head out to party!  The one part of this I would still do going forward is go scare up some fun at the nursing homes!  I love the elderly and volunteering with them.  This year I actually took out my costume and I have a great witch cape I made that, b/c I made it, stands the test of time!  It has been years since I wore it but with all this Sandy madness, I just was not prepared to go on Halloween.  Alas I look to next year\u2026!  I hope I am not too confident with all my \"next year\" planning!!!  Good day, girls-",

      "Content": "Nov 4, 2012 02:49PM - edited Nov 4, 2012 02:54PM by 1WonderWoman Good day, warriors! I hope everyone is having a lovely day!  We are getting into chilly times in the Northeast.  I feel so bad for all these people who have lost their homes and those still without power.  It was 30 degrees last night.  My heart is breaking for all of NY and now we have a Nor\u2019easter heading our way this week.  Unbelievable. Iowa: that is just awful what you all are going through.  That poor kid.  Did you all learn of the details of the accident?  It is just horrifying.  I hope you are doing ok.  So sorry for your senseless loss.  He was so young and the whole thing is just awful. Tex:  That is just great that the Xeloda and Tykerb come in pill form.   That is just great.  Makes life so much easier.  Was that your onc\u2019s first choice or was he being sensitive to your commute?  Reason I mention this is don\u2019t forget, the ACS has cancer lodges (I think this is what they are called) where you can stay, for free, when getting txs.  If they wanted you to get infusion chemo in SA, you would very likely get to stay in a lodge and perhaps you and dh could work it out that you will not be home one night.   In this way, if you had to get the neulasta shot the next day you can stay overnight in the lodge, get the shot and go home.   All things to consider but the pill is just great and convenient. That is an absolute freak of nature that the cancer is no longer ER+.  Effin cancer.  You starve what you think is feeding it and it finds a new food source.  I am so glad the rash on your face is just that!  Good news!  We have to relish every little bit of good news.   I think b/c it is a \u201cfilm\u201d on your lungs that it was getting ready to organize and it has been caught.  This film business might be part of the process with lung cancer.  I will ask when I go (to you know!) this month.  I want to know more about that and I would love to fly you up for a 2nd.  It might be one of the little known phases of lung cancer as it is organizing.  I think of all these rotten bastards out here that are just garbage bag versions of human beings.  Then I look at you, such a positive, lovely woman and so intelligent and inquisitive and just an absolute beacon of light for everyone and I look at the battle you are mired in.  I just hope they are learning from you and your positive mindset, combined with modern medicine, will defeat this mess! You know, something else: as for the nurse who is so concerned with the elderly in the chemo room is comfortable with being overly concerned for them b/c they \u201clook\u201d sick.  I told you, just like those 2 jokers I saw at Walmart that remark about how I look because, of course, they are all EYE DOCTORS and if they can\u2019t see it, it does not exist.  Cancer eats us from the inside out but I just think everyone thinks you have to \u201clook\u201d sick to have cancer.  I was dating this guy once I called \u201cyoung buck!\u201d He was like 8 years younger but in any case, my dad had lung cancer at the time.  For this reason I was coming back and forth from NY and would date \u201cyoung buck\u201d when I was in CT!  Well young buck picked me up one night at the RR station (my father did not know I was dating someone else\u2026think I told you all I wanted him to think I was still with the now ex!) and we went to Yale to see him.  Well, when we left Nick said to me \u201cyour dad does not look like he has cancer-ious!\u201d  I guess people just don\u2019t know, they just don\u2019t get it and the rudeness is in what they don\u2019t see does not exist.  If she takes her sweet ass time again, call me and give me her name.  I will call and have a talk with her ;) Sptmm: only jog 2 miles today, girl!  You need to pace yourself!!!!!  I hope you are having a good day. Omaz: I hope everything is going well out there in the nice, warm, balmy desert!  Yes, I am jealous! Actually, I don't mind it getting colder...for all of my talk about the cold, I do like the seasons.   Felis: definitely rest but you also need to respond to the iron deficiency.   I despise liver but Tex is right as all sources say eat organ meat.  If you like liver, get some.  My father used to eat it with onions\u2026gross-a-rita!!!!  That was definitely one of the alternate meal nights b/c none of us liked liver!  Skip the fried food as much as possible now AND going forward.  I know it is yummy but it is definitely not good for us cancer girls.  In fact, I allow myself fried food no more than once per month and often times not even that.  You have to be careful, too, b/c almost everything is fried.  I like fried clams so if I want to have those, it is no more than once per month.  I never fry food at my house (my father, Fireman Bob, is on my shoulder reminding me of the perils of frying and the potential for fire!!) so it is always a treat but the oil is a catalyst for proliferation of cancer cells.  A few things you have to remember about cancer: cancer LOVES sugar; cancer LOVES IT when you don\u2019t exercise and if your bc is estrogen-driven then cancer also LOVES soy.    Don\u2019t help cancer, help yourself.   Do a little walking, watch your sugar intake and avoid soy.  I know the jury is out on \u201cgood soy\u201d and \u201cbad soy\u201d for us bc girls but as far as I am concerned, soy is estrogens bff so if you have an ER+ bc, I would skip the soy almost entirely.   BTW, the way we ate before bc definitely did not cause bc BUT now that we know it is here, we don\u2019t want to accommodate it in any way.  This is why I say take simple steps nutritionally to starve it.  There is no guarantees, just smart moves.  Make sure you go get some liver today especially you like it!! The other day I found an old Disco workout tape.  Yes, I am one of the last people in the Western Hemisphere with a working VCR!!  Well, let me tell you all, I had totally forgotten how it is both fun and a workout! #goodtimes Good day, girls-",

Felis: get Boost in the morning but I agree with Ginger: you have to reach out to your dr.  Don't sit here sick, 1 week from chemo, and not have a conversation with your dr about how you are feeling.  You need to talk about this before you go for another tx. I am watching Rock Center right now.  They are interviewing/telling the story of one particular woman from Staten Island.  She was just now saying she closes her eyes and remembers what her neighborhood looked like before Sandy and she does not want to open them.  For the first time since this bc experience began, I woke a few days ago prepared to get up and get ready for work, thinking I had had a nightmare about having cancer.  It was awful.  If I had known what opening my eyes meant that morning, I am sure I would not have and would have stayed in the comfort of my pre-bc life for a little while longer.

I don't know what happens but along with life and its regular business, in walks the holiday and you don't realize the pace has quickened so much until you realize it is Friday, November 16, less than a week from Thanksgiving!!!  In any case, I hope everyone is doing well and are ready for the holiday! Felisa: At this point, I totally know how you feel about more surgery as I have been there.  What I want to remind you of is if you do require more surgery, this should fix the problem and may be required to fix the problem.  I know, believe me, I know how awful the thought of another surgery is but be brave!  It all works out.  Don't get yourself worried about something that has not happened/been suggested yet.  Just take things 1 day at a time.  Did they remove any nodes when you had the lumpectomy?  Sometimes water that you could be taking on, if you had nodes removed, might indicate a little lymphedema starting.  Of course, no surgery would be involved if this is the case.  Keep us posted on how you are doing.  I am sure everything will work out.  As I always say, hang in there...better days and higher love are coming!! Omaz: You have not been around at all which tells me you must have gone to your vacation home in Belize for the holiday month!!!!!  Check in, woman, and help me stop my wandering mind regarding what Iperceive to be (I suspect I have made up!) your posh and glorious lifestyle!!  Hope you are doing well ;) Well alas I have *stuff* to do!  My addiction to \"Words With Friends\" grows also!  I might have to go to DMV in a few weeks and I am relishing the very notion, for the first time in my life, as I will have ample WWF time even though we don't have enough chairs in most DMV locations! I can certainly play WWF while standing, however! Happy trails, girls!",

Rachel: isn\u2019t that the truth about business trips?  I was just talking to my brother who travels just about 3 weeks per month and in past conversations he has basically said the same thing where he sees the inside of the meeting rooms and the inside of his eyelids in the hotel and that is it!   That is a shame  that you hustled all the way to Denmark for a few meetings and shuffled back on a plane.  Well, at least you kicked that cold before you left, right?!  I am realizing as I type I am being presumptuous!  Ironic you mention these crazy sales.  When I was on chemo, and like an idiot, I went to Best Buy.  It was raining and cold and instead of letting us line up in the warm mall, they made us wait outside in the freezing cold rain so we would all enter through the parking lot entrance.  I thought that was rude. I was texting my friend who was at Walmart, nice and warm, and in an orderly line!!  I have only gone twice and I just don\u2019t have the patience either.  Unless you camp out, by the time you get to the counter all the good stuff is usually gone with the first 50 people or so.  It is just not worth it to me. That sounds like fun in going dress shopping with your sister!   Making memories, girl!  That is what it is all about. I wonder where that other Canadian globetrotter, Sweeney, is?!?!? Tex: you know I am always thinking of you and hope you are feeling well.  I know being back on chemo is a bit of a drag but at least it is pills so no traveling and it is going to patch you up and send you on your way ;)   Hope you are feeling better by the minute, girl! I hope everyone is feeling well and enjoying this pre-holiday week!  Good day, girls-",

I would definitely call your GP and/or bs for appointments this week.  I would call my bs right away tomorrow morning and get in there for an appointment. I hope you feel better. Tex: how are you, woman?!  I hope you are feeling better and better every day ;)  Stop by and let us know how you are.  I suspect you will most likely rest tomorrow after the week off with the kids so maybe we will hear from you on Tuesday!  I hope all is well. Sptmm: you are most likely running some marathon today!  Just thinking of you and wondering how you are. Well I hope everyone is doing well.  Good day, girls!",

We have all had a shared experience and I guess it is presumptuous of me to think there might be an opinion on hair coloring and/or searching the memory for Jeopardy answers besides your's so thank you!  Funny that you mention your friend being a published author as I play Boggle with a woman who is also a published author.  My friend and I just like to drink wine and joke around meanwhile the author and my friend\u2019s sister get totally fired up and competitive at Boggle night!  My friend and I laugh!  We try to work the table so those 2 are close to each other!  Then one night I brought a guy with me and he is a great player also.  My friend had such a blast watching the author and the guy I brought battling it out at Boggle lamenting the fact her sister was not there that night!  I like WWF and Scramble With Friends as it is good exercise for the mind.  I just don't like all the stupid 2 letter stuff at the end!   As for reaching out, I love the elderly and I do try to get out there even just to visit and maybe read a story or the newspaper to them.  I used to teach them how to use the computer at a senior center and what fun I had!  I loved it! Also when the schools have \u201cInternational\u201d week/month etc\u2026 I do teach Japanese.  In fact, I will show the kids the evolution of a few basic characters but the big hit is showing them how to write their names in Katakana which is the elementary level alphabet for all words Western.   I have not done the school thing in over 5 years now between work and then this bc business.  I would like to do it again.   I generally only do it in urban schools.  The kids are fun and it is always an enjoyable experience. About one side of your face collapsing, a guy Richard I worked with at Lehman Brothers came in one day and it really looked like he had a stroke. As it turns out it as temporary, a palsey of sorts, and it went away in about a month or so.  It was something to do with his nerves and if this pathetic memory serves, I think it was traced back to something in the water in Manhattan at that time but I just can\u2019t remember what it was. Speaking of Manhattan, google NYSE Christmas Tree and look at how beautiful that tree looks in the canyons of Wall St!  It is so beautiful.  I miss working down there like the desert misses rain and I am not going to spend the rest of my life, however long that might be, hiding from the stress that would come with a return to the financial industry.  I can\u2019t live in a bubble and that is where my heart is. White hair can really work on some people.  There was a woman that worked for my mother years ago who had a nice white, short hairdo and she just looked great.  I am not going back to $300 in the salon with the over-30 (now 40!) caramel swirl like I used to.  I am just sticking with the box for now.  I never did the box but it is working out fine.  It is actually kind of fun!  The woman whose hair went bright red from the Whole Foods color is petrified to do anything else.  I asked the question to find out if anyone else was worried and that worry delivered them to a less-red solution!  After chemo I did not even want to use nail polish nevermind hair color but now I am ok with it.  The bc rates are so high in CT, in this tiny state, I am sure it is not hair color that is causing the problem! Felis: you are almost there, almost done, putting chemo behind you and marching off into the future filled with wonderful memories you will make with that beautiful grand baby of your\u2019s ;)  Keep it up with the water and protein and soon chemo will be a memory! Iowa:  You need to write a letter and I would not hesitate to call the ACS and explain your problem.  They might be able to tell you how to get it fixed.  I would also telemarket the \u201cS\u201d out of that office until you get someone on the phone and do that 3 way call with the insurance co.  It is egregious the Mayo Clinic cannot fix that code as what you had done is *not* cosmetic.  I would not be paying that bill.  Call the Cancer Legal Resource Center (866) 843-2572 and they also have a Midwest office.  I called them a few months back and they were able to give me all the information I needed and hooked me up with an attorney here in CT that deals with cancer patients rights almost exclusively and as that pertains to several matters.  I would give them a try.  You need to get that fixed.  Let me know if the CLRC helps you. Happy week, everyone!  It is busy coming into these last few weeks of the year but it is all good!!",

Assault weapons ban is not the answer.  By banning guess what?  We create more of a market and we allow shylocks to start selling unregulated, in the streets.  We allow foreigners who ply our streets with BANNED drugs every day to start selling assault weapons.  Drugs being illegal has worked out really well. Don\u2019t you think the FBI tracks purchases of these guns and keeps track, vets these people?   In the 80s there were assault guns but we did not WANT them because we did not learn about how to use them, every day, all day, in Pac Man or Frogger.  We did not learn about assault weapons riding our bikes, swimming, running, skiing, jumping etc\u2026 so they had NO PLACE in our lives.  The fact remains why are our young men falling in love with killing en masse using semiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines?  Wherever are they learning this?  Oh, maybe it is the 50,000 hours they spend playing \u201cCall of Duty\u201d and all those other wicked games.  Sorry but we are being gripped by a society of young men raised on games that are filled with killing and now life is imitating electronic arts.  Big surprise and as you all know, I live in CT and I know people affected by this god awful tragedy but the gun did not wake up, kill it\u2019s mother, get in the car and drive to an elementary school and kill a bunch of kids; that was a person and a person who got this idea somewhere and if this person had such a desire to kill, they would have found a way irrespective of means.  Don't forget, they can make bombs from stuff they can purchase at Walmart. I feel bad for parents because these game systems and creators have gone crazy, these kids love these games and it is so hard to deny them.  We loved PacMan b/c that is all we knew.  Why do all these games have to involve so much killing?  I loved Super Mario.  My nephew in his 30s loved Zelda and Tetris.  I don't know but all I know is I have been crying for days and days and these poor kids, they were just babies and the poor teachers and the principal, it is all just awful.  How did no one know this kid could flip?  This is what I would like to know because be it a bomb or a car or fires or guns, there might have been signs.  There might have been although I just don't think anything could have alerted anyone to his lethal potential.",

One day a friend\u2019s wife walked in and was asking who was playing!  She really thought it was a live game. If I was the President, first thing I would have done this morning is call that damn Electronic Arts and all these other game makers and put on them on warning that they better figure out some other way of entertaining our kids.  If I was happy with Ms Pac Man (which I still play occasionally!) then why can\u2019t kids be happy with Mario etc.. again?  Personally I think the game manufacturers are grossly irresponsible.  Having said that, even though the last 4 mass killings totally resemble an individual acting out a video game fantasy, there is nothing new under the sun and before video games, there were still mass killings like the post office killings of the 80s.  Bottom line is we have radar for everything but nut cases.  Sweeney: good to hear from you!  I was wondering what happened to you!  Happy holidays and happy trails, woman! Everyone has an opinion on this.  The bottom line is we all care enough to think about it, develop an opinion and share it with others.  The problem is multifaceted.  We are all correct in one way or another.  I am just so broken hearted over watching these poor little kids being buried.  You know what really makes me cry? We don\u2019t know what happens when we leave here but you can\u2019t help but wonder if they are all together, if they are ok, if they even understand what happened and it is all just so sad.  Just this morning a school was evacuated in an adjacent town as there was a suspicious person near the school. Tex: On that note I can\u2019t imagine what it would be like to go back to school after Columbine, now Newtown or even to go to the movies after Aurora.  There was a man in New Haven that took a gun he was licensed to carry to the movies with him when he went to see \u201cDark Knight.\u201d  I forgot how it all transpired but somehow he was found to be carrying the gun, was arrested and had to go to court.  Bottom line is this peaceable person wanted to protect himself and that was it.  By the time it got to court, the case was thrown out.  God help us",

One of them had that deep, throaty, bronchial type of cough and the other was coughing and sneezing.  I could not get away and I just knew I caught whatever one or the other had.  They were just too close to me which bothers me anyway and I was about to leave the aisle when I was attacked by their germs!   That blew Christmas in a big way.  It all started late Saturday/early Sunday and my first symptom was my *eyes* hurt.  By Sunday night I was down for the count.  I am not out of the woods yet but I hope to be soon!  Iowa: I finally found you in that photo!  The other night I was looking but I just could not find you!  It is a beautiful family photo. Felisa: hope you are doing well and feeling better.  Sorry I was not feeling better b/c I would have really kicked into overdrive a \"YAY chemo is over\" online party for you, my dear!  Darn flu took me down! Ginger: I hope you are doing well and you had a nice holiday. Omaz: finally going to roll out that Wii maybe this weekend!  Sadly did not even have a chance to play yet! Rachel: Mexico...so good for the soul!  The equatorial life.  You know, I could dream of detaching from the pace of the northeast but I honestly and truly do not think I could ever do it for longer than a vacation. I also don't like going anywhere for more than a week except Asia b/c it takes so long to get there.   Tex: hope you are feeling better esp now that you are on that reduced dose of chemo!  That was really good news.  We can all infer that means your chemo is working and also that you are doing better!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!  All good news. \"I Love You to Death\"--well I think you all know I love you to death but I am talking about the movie!  I got it for Xmas from an old friend.  It has been years since I saw that movie and had forgotten how funny it is!  If you all are looking for a laugh and have not seen it, it is an oldie but goodie!  In between flu-sponsored napping I watched it!  I do not wish this flu on anyone. My friend in NYC is having his NYE party this year after not having had one in the past 4 years for a variety of reasons.  I am hoping I am a) feeling up to it and b) not put off by what appear to be very cold temps.  I used to be such a party animal!  Now I am a couch animal!  Honestly, though, this flu hit me so hard I am almost afraid to push it NYE.   I might be hanging around with my old friend, Smoking Loon...cabernet sauvignon that is!!!!!     I am tired again.  Hope you all are doing well.  The snow is nice these days, not too much and just enough to make us feel in the spirit...nice! ",

I love roller skating!   My friend Mary goes every Monday night and I am thinking about joining her in a few weeks.  It is so much fun.  There is  (was) a great rink in the Bronx that played the best music!  It was so much fun.  They also served on Friday night so a few guys I knew from the exchange that were from the Boogie Down and I went with them a few times- such a blast and good exercise also! I think it is so sad how much everything costs for families.  The other day on the radio some guy asked what he could get for $50 and he said 4 movie tickets and ½ a popcorn!  I don\u2019t know how families handle it.  My brother loves the movies and is always taking one or both sons. Movies are $11-$13 here.  Sometimes one can catch a cheap matinee.  $48 for all of you is a good deal not to mention you get some exercise!  Ginger: a friend moved to FL about 6 years ago.  He started talking about moving back to CT and he is convinced his blood has thinned to the point it is not even possible.  I know what you mean, though, it has been bitter cold here, single digits, and I don\u2019t like it much below 30. Felisa: that wound vac tape is a god send!!!!!!  That stuff is so great.  I had 8 open holes after the summer surgery and the nurses who were coming in to treat me used that tape on some of the gauze that was not holding.  It worked wonders!  I am glad you are doing well and your surgery is over.  You see, things are getting better already for you! Sweet dreams, girls ;)",

Felis: one of these days you will really start to feel like you turned a corner and now it is all pretty much uphill from here ;)  You have made it through the hardest part so you should feel pretty proud of yourself!  Also, if you think \u201ceveryone\u201d makes it b/c they have to, not true.   A lot of people leave chemo, don\u2019t go back, don\u2019t take their meds etc\u2026 so you need to remember you stuck it out, did the right things and you are going to be much better off for it.  Good times ahead, woman! Iowa: we totally have that in common as I love, love, love working with the elderly!  I have done it for years on a volunteer basis and once I did companion work part-time.  I really love it and in talking w/my GP about going into nursing (when I was considering it) he brought up the \u201cblood and guts\u201d point and, as thing would turn out, I am not cut out for that.  He mentioned occupational therapy and I looked into it but it is educationally a complete retooling and a 6 year degree at that.  I did also look into occupational therapy assistant classes and those are only 1-2 years depending and you can work exclusively with the elderly helping them make their at-home life easier.  You might want to check into it, take the classes in Iowa and then take your education to FL.  There are literally tons of OTA jobs in FL.  Also I had clients that were retirees in Vegas and her dh got a job driving one of those tourist buses and he absolutely loved it!  If you all move to a to touristy area in FL perhaps your dh could drive the tourist bus (always fiercely entertaining!) and you could do OT work!  BTW, totally not crazy to have life planned out that far in advance.  Also there are incredible real estate deals to be found now all over FL and I actually heard about some good deals in Port Richie over the holidays.  More to this point, planning ahead esp in this RE market is never a bad idea. Cable drama: they were supposed to be here 5 days ago as I have always been wireless but no wireless plans are unlimited except Clearwire and I hear good and bad about them.  In any case, I am in the kitchen tonight and hear a vehicle coming up my driveway.  I go out and it is the cable co!  I told him I cancelled as they were supposed to be here 5 days ago.  He then tells me if I did let him in it was going to generate a $100 charge for a \u201cfailed\u201d self-install?!?!  I am like you all never went to the pole so how could it be a failed self-install?!  Am I supposed to do the pole work also?! I just walked back in the house and as I am walking away and he is playing with his phone he said \u201cdo you want me to leave?!\u201d  Yes, yes, I would like you to leave!   I packed that equipment up when they failed to get here Sat and it is going back to their office in the morning! Well I have made my favorite seafood bisque this evening and am going to watch what I hope will turn out to be some entertaining tv tonight! Night, girls-",

I hope it never comes back, although it may! Nipples were the final part of that surgery last week.  The reason the bleeding was so bad is because it was from my breast and I have *no* feeling there.  I was really under the impression I was getting up to go to the bathroom!  I had no idea until I looked down at my arm in the bathroom.  What a mess.  The body is amazing, however, and I think \"it\" woke me up b/c I had been bleeding for who knows how long.   How was girls night out?  Did you like Les Mis?   Watching Aziz Ansari on Netflix and all this laughing is keeping my mind off this other crap!!! ",

I hope this day finds you happy and healthy!  I spent the morning travelling over an hour roundtrip to this MRI which was supposed to be \u201copen\u201d MRI but alas it was not!  I don\u2019t do the tube.  I was told scheduling does not know it yet but Yale has no open MRI.  How could this be?!! Rachel: I hope you are doing well and I do reach out to you today as I am freezing in CT so I can only imagine it is devastatingly cold in Canada!  Also I rather enjoy regaling you with tales of our ridiculous \u201chealthy\u201d care system we have here in the states!  This morning as soon as I get to this appointment a rather commodious woman opens the glass window and barks out that she needs my driver\u2019s license and insurance card.  Just to catch a little rec on her, I say I don\u2019t have them!  She tells me I will have to \u201cleave\u201d as they will not be MRIing me w/out the magic \u201cinsurance\u201d card and DL!!!! I giggled and offered up my cards!  I asked why the DL and she said that was if I don\u2019t pay they can track me down! I reminded Blue Cross covers this and she said the DL is a \u201cjust in case\u201d measure!  You see, if they don't get every dime for the extremely over-priced test, they will drag people to court and/or ruin their credit over the bill!   It gets better as I tell her I can\u2019t wait until that luscious Obamacare is in place as we won\u2019t be accosted financially or verbally (in this case) over egregious, and invasive, overcharging and overbilling measures!   NO more being barked at about where our \u201ccards\u201d are!  This is where Canada comes in: she starts explaining how things are so great here and how \u201cthousands\u201d of people are coming from Canada to the US for MRIs!!!!!!!!!!!  Obviously she is over-drinking from the AMA-provided propaganda well!  I tell her there must be a shortage of fireplaces in which to toss one's cash in Canada as MRIs are covered there under their \"socialized\" med!  I tell her that my bc cyberfriend has all the same txs that I have without the bills and how she was able to *keep* her job and NOT go flying through her dollars in order to try to stay alive!  When I tell Capt Commodious this she is now red in the face!  I remind her that buffoons who perhaps want to get fat sucked out of their ass and put in their face may have to come to the US for such demeaning and shallow procedures but the rest of you all in Canada, dealing with awful disease are not also being thrown out of MRI centers b/c you don\u2019t have \u201cmagic\u201d cards that are your ticket to the medical capitalistic merry-go-round! She remarks she does not know why more people are not moving to Canada! I remind her everyone lives with the notion \u201cit  (et al)\u201d will NEVER happen to them and by the time it does, it is too late to move, garner citizenship and be able to receive healthcare in a timely manner while you are a battling a disease that is trying to eat you alive. I remind her the whole of Europe is doing fine on socialized med also.  Now, after all of this, I get in there and find out it is not open MRI!  One hour travel time, gas, $7 for parking for a little over an hour and still no MRI = priceless!  I hope you enjoyed this edition of \u201cBorn in the USA, Dying in the Streets!\u201d  I think I am going to start a Podcast!  In fact, I think I am going to do that this weekend.      Felis:  yes, we are going through it!  That open wound looks so gross, I do get nauseous! I sure hope we don\u2019t have to look at open wounds much longer!   I hope your wound is healing up.  I go back to the surgeon next week.   A friend gave me an 80s collection of music off of Itunes for Christmas and I am just getting into it now and there is nothing but good stuff in there!!!!!  Good stuff not the least of which is \u201cRock Me Amadeus!!\u201d Good day-",

I am ½ joking, ½ serious here.  I am so blessed to have a wonderful, talented and helpful PS who very kindly, once again, tried to cut that damn keloid out (that she had absolutely nothing to do with causing) during another surgery and she was successful this time!!!   People without cancer have no idea what an awful place this disease leaves you and all the awful stuff we go through.  It is just terrible and you know I am not one for talking about terrible but it leaves you in an awful awkward place so lie like a freakin\u2019 rug!!!!  Don\u2019t ever tell them you had cancer.  Tell them you went to CT to help your old friend Liz during her protracted cancer battle!! Lady, it was good to hear from you.  I am glad you are doing well!  Good luck in your job search and I will gladly be your alibi!!   Felis: I am so happy to hear you are healing good!!!  YAY!!!  Good news!  The pineapples are great!  Love them.   I think Iowa was correct in that they definitely have healing properties! Ginger: I hope you kick that cold and soon!  Stuff is just hanging on these days.  I was talking an elderly woman at the MRI center last night and she said it was her feeling that stress levels are higher these days than ever and how it seems these colds, viruses and flu are having extended life b/c of that.  Tex: when you run?!  Aren\u2019t you on chemo?!  What are you doing running?  Do you mean just back and forth to the car or are you out laying down some miles?!  You are the best!  I am telling you, VitaFusion calcium chews are yummy!  Never again will you complain!  Also CVS does chewables and they are gross but at least they are not 1\u201d long and 1/2 \u201c wide!!!  Try those VitaFusions and I am telling you calcium can be yummy!  Good times, girl, good times!!  I am so glad you are out skating and running and enjoying life!  You are my hero (and now I am going to sing \u201cWind Beneath My Wings!!!\u201d)!  Seriously you are very inspirational! Well my favorite girl Betty White is celebrating her 2nd 90th birthday in a special on NBC and I am going to tune in! Valerie Bertinelli looks better than ever!  Amazing!   Smile because it immediately changes your state and the states of those around you!!! ",

I hope everyone is doing well.  As for the weather, it is 28 tonight and maybe 40 tomorrow.  With these sharp hot flashes, I am not interested in hitting the 80s too soon!  In Connecticut we go from 50 in April to 90 in May and that is our Spring! Connecticut casinos: I am no gambler and I don\u2019t smoke cigarettes therefore I have few reasons  to go to these casinos except that my old pal from NYC, who now lives in WY, was back home in Mass and went to Mohegan to see \u201cPink.\u201d  I agreed to meet her, her sister and cousin after the show as I could not work it out to make the show.  I can tell you all this much-I could not get the heck out of that place fast enough as it is nothing but a big, fat smoke fest!  There were people wielding those \u201csmoking guns\u201d everywhere!  There is 1 small, non-smoking casino which was at the farthest point from any exit doors so it was basically a place to go to catch your breath and try to make it back to the exit without getting lung cancer!!!   It was gruesome!  My friend said the concert was good, though!  Iowa: I have been to more lawyers in these past 2 weeks than I had been in the previous 3 years.  Do *NOT* let them ruin your credit with a bill related to your cancer.   Get a lawyer.  It should be illegal for healthcare bills relating to cancer to be turned over to collection agencies at all.  It shoots off a nice big flare as to where you have been recently and that there is \u201csome\u201d healthcare issue you are dealing with.  Why the hell should your medical business be stuck all over your credit report? Don\u2019t let these bastards get away with anything and I know you might be tired of cancer and all things cancer but we owe it to the women that are destined to join us in this fight to stop the keep fighting against the injustices!!!  Ginger: speaking of suing, perhaps you were right about the grocery store as my CT scan showed my arm is broken!  I actually did break my arm when I fell and they found it incidental to scanning for cancer!  Of course the concern is why is it taking so long to heal and they are now looking into that.  My arm still hurts and I have very little strength but it is coming back, albeit slowly. I am sorry you are alone out there with those watch dogs barking at nothing!!!  Animals are great to have around but when you are alone, especially with dogs, they can scare you even more!  I am sorry to hear about your dh\u2019 father.  Cancer is just ubiquitous.  I hope those dogs stop barking at nothing!  Your dh will be home before you know it ;) Tex is doing ok but is still without a computer.  She is doing ok w/chemo.   She does have a wonderful non-cancer-related announcement for us upon her return! I hope everyone is doing well and had a nice Easter weekend Night, ladies-",

Ginger: yes, I am fine!  Thanks for asking.  Working through some \"hot spots\" but alas aren't we all?! Of course my broken arm is one of the spots and I am just hoping that heals correctly as it was not caught and casted when it happened b/c the nature of the break would not show on a traditional xray.  It was caught on a subsequent, and unrelated, CT scan. How are you feeling? Did you have a painting class this week?  I hope you are feeling a little better.  I, too, was up nursing myself through hot flashes, and watching this stuff unfold in the Greater Boston area.   Just insane. Felisa: good to hear from you!!!!!!  I get a little nervous when I don't hear from \"regulars\" for a bit but in your case I knew it was that you were out celebrating your new lease on life!!!!!  I am so happy you are almost done with rads and as I told you, summer is almost upon us and you are feeling good!!!  You will have a good summer, woman, and don't pass up a single opportunity to get out and have some fun! Rachel: thinking of you!  Hope all is well.  Have a good weekend with the boys and I hope things are stable w/you MIL. Sptmm: I hope you have a good weekend and all is well with you!  Deb, I am so very inspired to both lose weight and get back into my pre-cancer/misery shape, I am softly considering trying to train to run the marathon next year.  I was just telling a friend last night.  Back to the \"couch-to-5K\" I go.  More to this point, if I get my \"physical\" crap together and get to the point I can lay down a 5K, I will be calling you, my bc sister, and we are going out for a jaunt!  Give me 6-8 months, however!!!  Seriously I am thinking September/October.  It might take me 2 years to reach marathon shape but I will get there ;) I hope you all are having good times, enjoying spring and having peace of mind.  I am sitting here with the windows open as a cool, pre-rain breeze is blowing in.  This time of year is *the* best!

Ginger: thought of you this  morning as Dr. Gupta was on Rachel Ray talking about how eating kale, turkey, ginger and garlic sautéed together is one of the best collective antidotes for migraines and how onions, olives, processed meats and some other items are high in tryremine which is a migraine trigger.  I am sure you know all of this but I wanted to tell you about that turkey, kale, ginger and garlic stir fry.  In any case, thinking of you and hope you are doing well. Ladyinbama: good to hear from you!!!!!  I  have missed you!  That is so completely exciting, and fulfilling, having been accepted as a research scholar!  That is wonderful!  I hope you enjoy Chicago this weekend!  That keeps you busy, keeps you on the cutting edge of all things to do with OC and it must be a wonderful feeling to deliver news of research and information back to the community.   That is just great and I am so happy for you!  BTW, I went to a new hairdresser and she had bc twice over the course of 14 years.  She says both husbands left her during her battle, both times!!!!    As far as the entire gender goes, there are far many more losers than non-losers! Thanks for the info on Environmental Work Group!  I will look into it. Keep us posted on your work as a RAN Scholar!  I could  not be happier for you! Have fun, enjoy and show them what you are made of, girl! Rachel: you are raising such nice, thoughtful boys!  Sounds like he will make a great husband some day if he possesses such emotional intuitiveness and such a thoughtful nature at his young age!  Such a beautiful story!  You should be so proud!   Today is your mental health day off and I hope you do spend the day in bed if you so choose!  Hope you are having a good day and you really need to take time for yourself.  I know those are somewhat overused, and seemingly empty, words but the message is the same: care for yourself with downtime as it is very much a key component of your overall health and if you don\u2019t take it, no one will give it to you.  Take the time, rest and don\u2019t feel one bit guilty about it! Sptmm: that goes for you, too!  Take some time for yourself once in a while and study the fine art of relaxation!  Also, on dogs, you can get a Pomeranian as they have \u201chair\u201d and not fur.  It is the fur dander that is a problem for most that are allergic.  There are a few other \u201chair\u201d dogs.  Check into it.   Also, yesterday I met a bc survivor recently who was asking me about my *humongo* breasts and I explained.  In any case she felt she would be too thin to get a flap!  I explained about you and how I think she will be just fine!   She was very small by nature but people are so ludicrous to think they don\u2019t have enough fat to rebuild what will be super small boobs!!!  I explained they were able to harvest a few pounds off your lean ass so I am sure she would be ok!!!! Felisa: YouTube \u201cjumping spider\u201d and you will see some entertaining videos!  Those spiders can be pretty big and a little too scary for me! I hope you guys have a great weekend.  I feel like I am forgetting something\u2026will post later! Happy trails-",

Ginger: I feel so bad that in an attempt to console your crying dgd you pulled your back.  Think about how hard it must be to be a child and not able to get up onto a toilet, know you have to go, trying to do something about it and failing miserably.  That has got to be so difficult on her, I don\u2019t blame you for reaching down to get her.  I am sure you have a spare stool at your house now.  I hope your back feels better by now.  Sorry to hear about your dh\u2019s dad.  I  know that is a lot of animals to take care of but I am sorry, it also sounds wonderful!  I love animals!  Before bc I was working 10 hours per day and in the Wall St days I easily worked 12+ hour days so I just felt that one cat is enough.  If things work out and through some changes I am able to find a way to be home more, I will be getting a dog soon.  I saw a Shepherd today that was just beautiful!  I love them.  In any case, although your dh has to clean up after all these animals while you are laid up, you can make it up to him!  Make him a nice dinner and a great bottle of wine and simply say \u201cthank you!\u201d  That should do the trick! I read the strangest thing this recently: the President of MSK does **not** eat sugar.  Also it was noted that a famous Harvard researcher, who is also credited with discovering P13 kinase, does not eat sugar.  Now the book stopped short of saying they are not eating sugar because they feel there is a connection to cancer but it was definitely implied.  This thinking does nothing to explain why the likes of Jane Fonda, Martina Navratalova, Lance Armstrong and 100s of other athletes and fitness freaks end up with cancer. On this note, recently someone made a comment how there is a 7-11 attached to a cancer hospital in Alabama.  He went on to say that it is set up like that so that everyone can go and get their candy bars and soda and then go get treated for their cancer.  Of course there is no 7-11 attached to any hospital in Alabama but this person was entertaining himself at the expense of those afflicted with this disease of which little is known about.   I don\u2019t drink soda but I did not want to interrupt this Mensa candidates wildly inaccurate and cruel deductions with something as perverse as FACTS!  Oh no, not scary facts!  Again, all those athletes, vegans and fitness freaks getting cancer... Do you all ever wish your ears could block stuff?! Finally everyone must watch Deon Cole on TBS!   Funny, funny stuff but I think he drinks soda so you better tune in quick b/c obviously his days are super numbered! Carry on, girls!",

Today I want to celebrate some women, who are still here and others posthumously, for their remarkable battle with breast cancer, as follows: Nancy Regan: she is still with us and is well into her 90s.  Nancy is a 25 year survivor of bc and,although she took a fall last year, is alive and doing well despite bc dx and tx in 1987.  I wish Nancy all the best and many years of continued bc-free existence ;) Jeanette Bey: Jeanette is 93 y/o, is from Lacrosse, WI and is a ***56*** year survivor of bc!!!!!!!!  Jeanette is obviously doing something very right!!!  This is very inspirational for us all!   Julia Childs (who I had the joy of working with 1 summer) and Betty Ford are both in the \"dearly departed\" category but neither died of their previously dx'd bc!!!  Both of these women were 40 year survivors of bc!  Amazing!  That is a lot of years and they were dx'd is the swallows of the \"drive-thru\" mx days of the 60s and 70s.  Inspirational for sure.  They both brought so much to the world and on this day, I want to remember these ladies for having beat bc and for thereby giving us all hope. Finally, Anastacia, is an American singer-songwriter that has several hits.  I love her freestyle/club music.  In any case, she was dxd about the same time I was.  She seemed to come back from it but has again been dxd w/a recurrence.  I want to wish her the best and I hope in some small way, somehow, she finds her way to sites like this one here to seek out inspirational stories of many, many women who have been dxd over and over again, with mets etc... and we are all still here!!!  There is hope for each and every one of us including Anastacia!  All my best- Speaking of miracles, did everyone read or hear about Katie Lentz who was in that horrific head-on car collision on a MIssouri highway?  She was just 19 and was trapped in a perfectly mangled vehicle.  The tools of the local First Responders were grossly inadequate and after trying to get her out of the car for over an hour, Katie asked them all to join her in prayer.  The police the accident closed off to traffic for 2 miles in each direction.  In any event, it is a poignant story on faith and I encourage you all to \"bing\" her name and read that story.  Unbelievable and no matter who he was, that young woman is still alive...just an amazing story of, if nothing else, human spirit. As for Bing, I love it!  They have made me a user of their search engine and how they hooked me: the pictures!!!!!!  I love the new and wonderful pics that show up each day!  Finally wanted to tell you all I contacted the \"Wounded Warrior Project\" to volunteer.  I received an email back they had too many volunteers and were not in need of any more.  I thought that was just great to hear. In any case, I receive an email today telling me they don't have much presence in CT and that I should go to the nearest VA Hospital to volunteer.  I hope someday they use all the volunteers that are trying to help, to expand the organization to all states.  Clearly there are Wounded Warriors in every corner of our country who could benefit from the help of a volunteer.  GO WOUNDED WARRIOR PROJECT!  Expand and bring assistance to every one of our treasured Warriors who need assistance.  I agree with Rachel in that summer is flying by! My best to all of you, hope you are having a great summer and to my dear friend Sptmm on LI, don't let those arthritis hawks slow you down!!!!!  Happy trails, ladies!",

Here goes (she does not measure so to taste, ladies..!):  Sautee onions and garlic in a little oil or your choice  After having roasted cloves of garlic in an oven at 400, and having cooled them, you can then squeeze the garlic into the pan w/the onions and carrots.  Mince about 3 or 4 tablespoons of fresh ginger and add that to the sautee  Add a chopped up jalapeno  Pour chicken broth over all these sauteeing items  Add some previously cooked chicken shreds or chunks  THIS makes one delicious, super easy, immune-boosting, nice winter soup!ENJOY!

Thanks for letting me know about \"Coolbreeze.\"  I read her posts here and there.  She was a strong contributing member in this bco community.  I don't know what it is about S4 that makes people stop, or cut down on, posting but they do.  To each their own; this disease is tough to deal with.  In any case, I will follow the link and support her.   Seeing her son graduate will be wonderful and very good for her soul!  I am sure she will be there. Well, ladies, these days are busy, busy but I do think of you all often.  I am trying to figure out a format going forward with this thread where I post bc developments on a regular basis.  I continue to work on this.  There are so many wonderful developments with this disease but I do believe, empirically, the best evidence that the evolution of caring for those with bc is, in fact, moving in the right direction is all of us!!!  We are all still here and this is truly a statement about how far the tx of bc has come. Finally, \"Bing\" has provided a nice holiday treat for us all!  Open a browser and go to bing.com to see the beautiful rainbow of holiday trees in a Achim Goyo, South Korea.  It is gorgeous!!! Happy holidays and happy and healthy New Year to everyone!",

On the chocolate, a very good friend sent me Godiva Peppermint Bark!  I love that stuff!  So, needless to say I am well on my way to working on #1! Tex: you know I am broken-hearted about your crap ass mets.  I send you all the positive vibes I possibly can all day ;)   I am hoping for the best results from rads.  Call me, text me, email me anytime, you know I am here for you, my friend.  I said it before, we walk this road together. Move more, eat less: you women make a very good point.  It does seem very simple.  I was just complaining I cannot make 3 flights of stairs (22 stairs per flight) which is really gross!  I mean I make it to the 3rd but I have to take a break at 2...so very sad.  I find it disgusting, in fact.  Now I take those 3 flights every day, 3 times per day, until I fix that problem! Rachel: you very cleverly pointed out once that Canada has given the world gifts with Lorne Michaels and the Bieber, just to name a few, but perhaps Canada's greatest gift to the US, and the world, is a very recent one.  Speaking of Toronto...that oh-so-dubious Toronto Mayor!!!  I am sorry to say I find it all very entertaining!!   The day he was dancing and then the day he nearly knocked the woman over and another time he was fighting with the legislature (I believe) and the next minute they were all singing together...in the legislature!!!!   Jimmy Kimmel has gotten so much mileage out of this guy and his antics!  This is all happening when he is presumably not high either!  So thank you, Canada!  Thank you very much! Glad you MIL was able to go out for her birthday!  That is wonderful.  It is good to hear that she at least seems stable for now.  I am glad she was with you all for the holidays.  I bet your boys were enthralled! Sweeney: good to hear from you!  It is 10 below here tonight and a friend is working, going door-to-door, fundraising for a PAC and they were out tonight.  He told me with 5 layers on he was still freezing.  I like the cold but 39 below, that is super cold even for me!  All I know is if you get out and move, you don't feel the cold quite so much so I hope you had a nice walk today! Sptmm:  that is a very good point about not wanting to leave any loose ends.  It is smart that you see it that way.  A lot of people don't.  Omaz: ?!  Happy New Year, woman!  Hope all is well ;)  Ginger: how are you out there in Washington?!  I hope you are feeling better.  I have to tell you this: there are these certain jeans I love and they are hard to get online and normally I would have to go to NY to get them.  In any case, I got a pair online on black Friday at a great discount.  Unfortunately, when they arrived the hem was coming undone and the seam was ripped open about 3\" up the leg.  My good friend in NY who always sends me nice gifts was listening to me complain about my inability to find a suitable tailor to handle this and lamenting my distance from NYC etc..  Because he listens he knew exactly what to get me for Xmas: he sent me a sewing machine!!!!!!!!  I thought of you right away!  I mean I like making catnip toys but I realized how much stuff I can make now and I am soooo excited!  I can't wait to get started.  One problem: it has been 30 years since I have sewn and this machine is kind of fancy, computerized etc...!  I went to Jo-Ann Fabric today and they actually offer a class and my machine is one of the ones they teach about!  I was so excited to find a class.  I will keep you posted on my sewing adventures!!!  Should be so much fun!  My new hobby is upon me! I hope everyone has a nice weekend!   ",

      "Content": "Jan 4, 2014 03:25PM - edited Jan 4, 2014 03:34PM by 1WonderWoman One more thing... Wolf of Wall Street!  I have told you all that I worked on Wall St, trading and all the fun stuff that goes along with it.  Well, if any of you saw that movie, it is very, very accurate.   I worked for a firm that was very much like, and fashioned after, Stratton-Oakmont.  Much like Stratton, the firm I worked for was shut by the SEC.  Stratton is the firm that Jordan built his humongous business on.  Also, the \"straight line\" closing system they talk about in the movie is very real and does exist.  It does not exist, on Wall St at least, in the watered-down form he is selling it in now, with that box of CDs but it definitely has life in every back alley in that industry. I was given a copy with the first firm where I really made some serious money and it definitely worked.   The pink sheets that they talk about at the firm on the island was the backbone of nearly every nefarious operation on Wall St.   All the stuff that took place in the movie with the midgets and the \"relations\" in the men's bathroom and the grotesque excesses- it is all very, very accurate!   He would sell a new customer like GE and then the second trade would be a pink sheet stock.  Pink sheets were largely shell companies and really they hardly existed.  The pinks were also completely unregulated, and still are to a large extent. For me, the movie did not have enough meat on the bone but b/c they made it for a wide audience, I understand they had to keep it palatable for everyone.  If anyone goes to see it, I am here to tell you that is *exactly* the way it was.  Exactly!  Some movie reviewer was screaming at Scorsese that it was an \"atrocity\" etc.. and that person was right in some ways b/c they felt he glorified what Jordan did.  The fact remains that Jordan sold something and someone bought it. That is all that happened.  Scorsese was not putting him on trial when he made the movie but was rather just telling a story.  It is a good movie and if you ever wondered about all that is \"Wall St,\" wonder no more!!!!! PS- I should have been more clear: I worked for Lehman Brothers in investment banking and there I learned everything I needed to know about research.  When I hit the sell side of the business, I did not need to rely on the firm to show me how to run money in the market and what stocks to buy.  I knew exactly what I was going to do and I spent my days buying and selling and my nights researching.  More to this point, I never, ever did \"pink sheet\" business.  You see, if you work for a firm and you make them money, they will leave you alone.  Wall St is stink with brats from the Island and the Fairfield County who think they can be brokers and traders so they get their parents friends to open accounts.  They bring in a few million and then they die on the vine b/c they can't do the job.  It is at that point that the firm will start putting those brokers who are dying on the vine on the \"firm\" plan.  Bottom line is those people needed direction and they were never going to make it in the business.  Other people were comfortable doing pinks and never wanted to work for their money.  I benefited in 2 ways: first I was the only woman on the trading floor so they never bothered me and I also already knew how to size up a company but if I asked even one of the guys on the floor with me what a PIB or a legend was, they would most likely not have a clue.  My background allowed me to architect a business that I wanted and I never needed to ask the firm for direction.  They never asked me questions b/c I made them money. Therein lies the difference.  Some people are willing to work harder than others and that is it.",

So, that was some opening ceremony I watched largely from a late happy hour!!!!!!  I am loving the Olympics! Rachel: yes, go Canada indeed!   I am just concerned your mayor might go overboard when Canada wins medals and based on the composite of his behavior to date, I am very concerned how \"overboard\" might manifest!!!!!!!!!!  Clearly Jimmy Kimmel will have some fun with it!  BTW, apparently we are not deporting Biebs...! Ginger: some time ago my stepmother had this white, plastic thing with Velcro strips that started just above her breast line and went down to her pelvis.  It was hard plastic and I was dating a very funny guy!  We decided, as my father's driveway was a hill extending down behind his house, we should sled her down the driveway!!!!!!! #goodtimes!  I don't think she loved our plans and she definitely did not love that \"brace\" she had to wear all day.  In any case, I am just really glad none of this is cancer-related for you. As for your dh and the cancer stuff, guys really do need us and I think they naturally are very unnerved by the idea they might be losing us. Nothing says \"see ya, honey\" like cancer!   I am sure he was just dreading going to any cancer appointments or surgeries with you as it suddenly drives home what is undoubtedly his worst fear: you are leaving him.   I would totally not read into his behavior with your cancer surgeries and appointments and take extreme solace in his ability to be there for you now when the appointments are something that can be treated and not something threatening to take you from his life.   We know 2 things about most men: they don't discuss their emotions and they hardly ever listen!  Aside from that, they are pretty darn good!   On the Seahawks, clearly the game was wonderful if you were in Seattle and/or a Seahawks fan!  My neighbor was having a very good time harassing me about my Broncos and regaling me with stories of his wonderful Seahawks!   I just meant the game was boring, as a lot of Superbowls are, b/c of the humongous shellacking Denver, or the other team, usually takes and in this case, took! Have a good weekend, Ginger---just think Spring is only a few weeks away ;) Tex: what is going on, girl?  Update please!  Hope chemo is going ok. Adey: how went the PET scan?  Either I was a 60s hippie in my previous life or this \"hell no, I won't go\" is just my adopted mantra toward all scans, docs and things cancer!  I give you all so much credit...but I just despise the idea of going....de-spise! Well Motley Crue was on Jimmy Kimmel Live tonight and I thought it a good idea to do some head-banging to \"Kickstart My Heart\" and now I think I have slipped a disc!!!!  Time for Advil, bed and praying I did not hurt myself!!   ",

I would like everyone to please tell me what they have come to expect at their annual/semi-annual check-ups?  I really need your help on this.  My entire trajectory w/bc, as you all know, was riddled with complications and surgeries galore.  More to this point, I don't know what to expect but I know you all talk about your scan results etc... so if you would, please share with me what your typical check-up is like.  I have to go in a few weeks and I really have not had any cancer testing or comprehensive, or any, scanning of any sort in quite some time.  In fact, I don't think I ever had a \"normal\" check-up due to all the complications.  This scares me which is why this next visit is making me nervous.   I know my onc likes to pull blood work but I really need a comprehensive check-up/looking over by now.  If you all would kindly indulge this request, I would greatly appreciate it! Ginger: If you have an IPod, most of them have a \"fitness\" app and that will do exactly what your husbands pedometer does.  The thing I like about the dedicated ones, like your dh has, is that is it's only function, tracking his steps.  If you were to use your Ipod, you would have to have it on you, and on, all day.  I use the feature on my IPod when I walk but I am going to get a pedometer b/c I do want to record all of my steps, all day. Also, I have been kind of disappointed with heart rate monitors.  All of us had chemo that, in one way or another, had a deleterious effect on our heart.  I did some research and ordered a Timex watch-style monitor.  After receiving and using it, I was a little disappointed to find out it struggles to give accurate heart rate readings *during* a workout!  I am now using to keep track of my resting heart rate or when someone is getting on my nerves (!!!) and I ordered a separate one, the kind that the VNA uses, that clips on the finger.  That is great, it comes with a cord I can put around my neck and I think it pretty accurately records my heart rate.  Congrats to your dh! 50 lbs is a lot and good for him, his heart, for you, for the dogs, for life and, most importantly, for health!  I am becoming obsessed with tracking my steps!  Sptmm:????????????!!!!!!!!!!! Ladyinbama: ???????!!!!!!!! Felisa: ???????!!!!!!!! Tex: thanks for stopping by, slim!!!!!!!!  You *need* to get protein powder from Target.  It is like $20 for a 4lb jug and you really need to mix it up with some almond milk and drink that every day.  You desperately need nutrition and that should be mostly protein.  Please, promise me you will get that powder?  Don't go to GNC as I know their powders are good but they are like more than twice the price of the comparable product you will get at Target. There is trace soy in the powder but my onc said not to worry.   Congrats on the weight loss!!!!!!  At least something good came out of this!  Speaking of weight loss, I have not weighed in yet this week but I was walking into the store tonight and my pants were trying to fall off!  Definitely not 20lbs though, girl!!!!  You have the crown of achievement on that one!!! Thanks for the well wishes on the Boston trip!  I love the Freedom Trail and I did not know they had the oldest park there so thank you, good to know ;) Much love and I hope everyone is doing well!",

Sadly Joan Lunden has joined us.  There has been so much coverage of her battle and triple-negative, no less.  So devastating.  Congruent with her going public, there have been associated stories.  One caught my eye: the one talking about how there is estrogen in a number of shampoos as well as parbens in almost every moisturizer on the market.  This is awful for us.   I have used Clinique since I was 13 and although it does contain trace amounts of both methyl and propylparabens, it is nothing compared to some of the others.  It is kind of gross, actually!  To think that doing something as innocuous as moisturizing our skin could be tantamount to driving recurrence probabilities.  So before you lather up in the shower, check out some organic shampoos, before you scrub your body with parabens, check out some organic body wash lines and before you smooth some copious amounts of estrogen all over your wonderful skin, reach for the olive oil bottle!

Tex: I hate to say this but \"Queen Helene\" was one of the biggest \"estrogen-in-a-bottle\" shampoos and I would not wash my car with that stuff!  More to this point, there were a lot of them.  So the old \"ah, any old shampoo will do, I will buy this $3 bottle instead of spending 20\" is not such a good idea after all!  Then again, I have always used everything from Graham Webb (one of my favs) to Biolage, Redken, Clinique and others and I got cancer!   These are just rules-of-thumb for those of us going forward and for those who read this thread to help family members etc...   As for cosmetics, I hardly use them anymore.  I am also bought a cruiser bike that I ride....I feel almost alarmingly bohemian these days!  This is the antithesis of the woman who raged Wall St for nearly a decade!!!   Life has its twists and turns, that is for sure! So how are you feeling?  I hope you are doing very, very well!  Check PMs also.  Sent you some very important information compliments of another of our thread sisters!   Everyone loves, cares about you, they all get very concerned when you don't post for a while and I think you needed to know this.  You have touched a lot of people with your beautiful spirit and will to live.   That is what keeps you beating this disease down and being an absolute beacon of hope for thousands who read this thread, spend time on this site and who have become familiar with you.  Thank you so much for being a part of this movement and for joining us here.  I think I speak for all of us when I say we love you!!   In closing, warriors, I want to remind you all to get moving.  Do some form of exercise every day and a reminder that \"rebounding\" and \"Pilates\" are very, very good for us.  Rebounding has an excellent effect on our cells (it fires them up to fight cancer) and Pilates is excellent for our lymphatic system.

      "Content": "Dec 20, 2014 12:51PM - edited Dec 20, 2014 12:55PM by 1WonderWoman Happy Holidays, Warriors! I love the new banner ad on this site about \"immunotherapy\"= the answer might be inside of you. That is very clever! The latest research is trending, even more, in that direction. In any case, and to end the year on a very positive note, I did a little research on new drugs for advanced bc, for both HER2- and HER2+ dxs. These continue to be auspicious times and I am so very happy we are all celebrating 5 next year! In any case, here is some information I gathered up for you--enjoy! The holidays are a wonderful time of the year when we have some time to ourselves and we can reflect on our lives. It is amazing to me we are all still here. All I ever knew about cancer was it was the death knoll so I am particularly grateful to be \"alive and kicking (a song you should all play this season!)\" and, in fact, that is my suggestion, as a gift to yourselves! Normally I suggest \"I am still standing\" but this year I think we should listen to \"alive and kicking\" while we reflect on our bc battle this holiday season. (Tex, you will have to look that song up!) In any event, I wanted to share with you all some advances in bc research and tx, for advanced bc patients. Just some information taken from www.cancer.org about some new drugs that are being used on both HER2+ and HER2- people, so there is a little something for everyone! As follows: Drugs that target the HER2/neu protein In about 1 in 5 patients with breast cancer, the cancer cells have too much of a growth-promoting protein known as HER2/neu (or just HER2) on their surface. Breast cancers with too much of this protein tend to grow and spread more aggressively without special treatment. A number of drugs have been developed that target this protein: Trastuzumab and pertuzumab are monoclonal antibodies \u2014 man-made versions of a very specific immune system protein. They are given into a vein (IV). Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody attached to a chemotherapy drug. It is also given IV. Lapatinib is a targeted drug that is not an antibody. It is given as a pill. Everolimus (Afinitor®) Everolimus is a type of targeted therapy that blocks mTOR, a protein in cells that normally promotes their growth and division. By blocking this protein, everolimus can help stop cancer cells from growing. Everolimus may also stop tumors from developing new blood vessels, which can help limit their growth. In treating breast cancer, this drug seems to help hormone therapy drugs work better. Everolimus is a pill taken once a day. This drug is approved to treat advanced hormone receptor−positive, HER2−negative, breast cancer in women who have gone through menopause. It is meant to be used with exemestane (Aromasin) in these women if their cancers have grown while they were being treated with either letrozole or anastrozole (or the cancer started growing shortly after treatment with these drugs was stopped). This approval was based on a study that showed that giving everolimus with exemestane was better than exemestane alone in shrinking tumors and stopping their growth in post-menopausal women with hormone receptor−positive, HER2−negative breast cancer that had stopped responding to letrozole or anastrozole. Common side effects of this drug include mouth sores, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, feeling weak or tired, low blood counts, shortness of breath, and cough. Everolimus can also increase blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and blood sugars, so your doctor will check your blood work periodically while you are on this drug. It can also increase your risk of serious infections, so your doctor will watch you closely for infection while you are on treatment. Finally, and we never talked about it much here, the financial burden of bc is a factor. I was happy to read in my Dana Farber newspaper \"Impact\" Fall 2014 edition, there has been a \"Hellenic Women's Club, Inc EOK Demetra Fund for Breast Cancer Research and Patient Assistance. This is the fir and only fund at Dana Farber that provides patient assistance specifically for bc patients. It is good to know this organization is able to help 130 women with the basics while they battle bc, when it is most needed.  It would appear things are moving in the right direction for all of us, ladies! Happy Holidays to you all and we must reflect on the fact that 2015 is the 5 year for all of us and how much that means for us. Remember that on New Year's Eve!!!  All my best to all of you during this holiday season, Your Fearless Leader ",

The first month of our collective 5-year anniversary is coming to a close and I am fresh of a trip to Yale for some check-up fun! Not for one second do I think I am \"cancer-free,\" as I believe that to be the most humongous misnomer if ever there was one, but I do enjoy each and every day I am here! Who knows what will happen next?! Wherria- we are indeed a very sparse group now but, for the most part, for all the best reasons: a return to a non-bc life. I, however, continue to post as do a few others. I am sorry to hear you are having a scare. I hope everything turns out alright. Please come back and post their findings. As for scares, perhaps you can take solace in the fact I have them every day, in perpetuity, in the confines of my wildly active mind! It is, however, a bit disconcerting when our own paranoia is exacerbated by empirical evidence there could be something amiss and I am sorry this is the case for you. Not something I am looking forward to but the we all know this can be the case, any time now. It just means it is time to fight again. I am there for you and I will start giving out capes, promoting mental health and being of the utmost support should one of my Warriors take a fall in this battle, even if there are only a few of us! That is what support is all about. I wish you all the best and it is my promise to every person that reads this thread, or who were ever a part of this group, I will be there for each and every one of you for as long as I very well can! This is our special place to come, to be amongst friends who know who we are and where we have been. On that note, it is a special place indeed and it is our place. We built this together. Happy trails and continue fighting the good fight! ",

Surely that is the result of my yelling out to an empty space, as the melodic sounds of my voice echo against the nothingness! Well, be that as it may, I am glad no one is here!!! This means you are all out living it up! Alas, Ginger, I am glad your complaints are about moving and not about health!!!! Moving is just an awful hassle, and to this point I am sorry for your short notice and square-footage reduction. My brother is a huge proponent of throwing everything away! I really think his next career should be in move management called \u201cThe Trash Man!\u201d In any event, I learn from him, and the important thing to do is get rid of everything you don\u2019t need. My heart breaks over the reduction in garages, however! I am having a moment of silence for you, lamenting the cruel world in which we live! My next house will be many garages (I want 5!), to accommodate my unhealthy obsession, and a small house \u2026for the animals! The garage story breaks my heart! I hope you have gotten your funds (deposit?) back by now. Sorry to read about your cousin. That is exactly the way it goes with cancer. You are cruising along, not a care in the world, not even thinking about cancer anymore, and here it comes again. I heard this story so many, many times when talking with some of the ladies during chemo, it is very common. It is a reminder we never, ever \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d have cancer; it is just not active right now. I am sorry, but I still take umbrage with the \u201ccured\u201d words of false hope and discouragement. It is NOT possible to be cured of this disease. I mean, sometimes I seriously wonder if people who talk in such terms even live in the same hemisphere with me. Now I find a blank stare is the best response! Meanwhile I would like to be in a mixed martial arts cage with this person who wants to use cure and cancer in the same *&^% sentence! Alas, I digres\u2026. Best of luck on your upcoming checkup! I wish you the very best! No one scans me, they do a little blood work, that is about it! I am not surprised at all about the \u201cno mammo\u201d business. I hope your cousin had a nice birthday and is tolerating chemo okay. Also, the small water heaters---environmental kudos to your landlord, woman! Nice that you are closer to family and have a nice yard to enjoy at this time of year. How are your pets? I am not sure I ever shared this here, and I don\u2019t think I did because I did not want to upset anyone, but my cat died of cancer over a year ago. I did not get another pet. She had cancer for years, alas it finally killed her. Meanwhile my friend in Manhattan is taking his dog for chemo, to the tune of $50,000. Yes, fifty-thousand dollars. Cancer is wicked sad, and wicked expensive, as well all know. Ginger, I just hope you are settled. I think of you now and again and am happy you are doing well. Whitney---any news? I have to ask in hopes that you are reading. Today\u2019s message: HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY, PEOPLE! FLAGS N\u2019 FLASKS!!!!!!! Hope everyone has a nice holiday and best of luck to you all in our continued battle against this disease. I think I am going to go look up \u201ccured\u201d now to see if the definition has changed\u2026.! ",

Lately I have been learning more about the cells that make up these wonderful bodies of ours, and about how many processes are taking place in one cell, every minute. It kind of lends to how complicated cancer is, and the more I learn, the more I think a cure will never be found! It is insane, but the more I learn about our bodies, the less hope I have! It is just amazing what goes in one tiny cell that I have to look under the microscope to get a better look at. Alas, and perhaps I have previously shared this, but cancer is indeed my doppelganger, in perpetuity! I sing the Laverne and Shirley theme song to my lovely doppelganger! Greek Mythology: it is called mythology, but in fact it was just a bunch of people trying to figure out where they were, and what the heck was going on around them. To this point, we say they purposely ignored certain facts as a means to advance their philosophies. I wonder what they will say about us, and our struggles with cancer, 5000 years from now, when a cure has been found, and people are living to be 800 years old? Will they say we purposely ignored certain facts (our food sources should not be plowed full of steroids and antibiotics, and then fed to us) as a means to advance our philosophies (that our bodies can handle all this garbage)? So it is nearly the holiday season, and the weather is just gorgeous. This is such a completely wonderful time of year, in the Northeast that is!! Of course I am teasing, and it is a special time of year all over the country. I hope you all are enjoying it. I know a number of you likely think of this thread, and the times we shared here. It would be nice if everyone posted, once in a while, or perhaps annually around the holidays, just to give an update. Happy trails until we meet again (and hopefully under much better circumstances!)-",

I am almost daily...! Sorry about your friends aunt, so sad :( Worse that it was so sudden. That is nice that you had your friend visit! So much fun to see old friends, and good ones at that! I think it is great that she sensed you needed a little help. All of our families are busy, and it is understandable that your DD, with a toddler and all, can do so much, so it is wonderful your friend was able to pitch in. What a good friend that is :) 18\" dolls? WOW! Did you use the scientific method?! Better start saving now, b/c by the time she gets accepted to Harvard or Yale, they are likely going to be $150K a year! I am so glad to hear you went to the museum with your DH! That is wonderful! I am also you got a wheelchair! Get out, get about, and enjoy your life, because as we all know, life is very short, so live it up! Keep going out, and I fully expect a report that you were apprehended by authorities for wheelchair racing in the mall! Dale Carnegie---giving you a reputation to live up to! Nice that the dogs can run wild! They must love it! As always, it is wonderful to hear from you- Wherria: I am so glad to finally hear from you, this cannot be overstated! It is okay you left us hanging, but I do so enjoy hearing from you, and now knowing you are doing well! What a relief. My anniversary date: I use the first day I saw my onc at Yale, b/c I was going to a hospital nearby my home, and if you are commutable to Yale, which I am, I decided to switch. My onc at the old hospital delivered the news, gave me a binder and a travel bag and tried to encourage me. In long, mine is 4/13, and I actually saw him this year on that date, and he reminded me that was the exact day I saw him all those years ago! Architectural abnormalities are quite a scare. Not checking them is entirely antithetical, good that you pressed on. It is good that he is open to your suggestions. Very scary that the inconclusive results were leading them to \"no biopsy.\" Glad you moved beyond your own doubt. I am sorry to say, but if we are not feeding kids with these things, and they are threatening to kill us, mastectomy is the way to go. Don't forget, with me it was 6 centimeters, 2.5 cancer, 3.5 cancer and it was in my lymph nodes already. If I went lump, they thought it was 1 cm based on the biopsy. I would have been dead. Glad you finally elected to go the full route. I don't know how they arrived at the idea that it did not look serious based on the MRI? I am so glad you just went beyond all of that, and scheduled the surgery. Your body was telling you something. I am also glad that you shared your story, because don't forget how many people read this thread, and how many of them are where we were 5 years ago, and where you found yourself just recently. I thank you for feeling comfortable enough to share your story with us. It is important that we all continue to record here, as this will outlive all of us, and will help millions in the fullness of time. I am not over it either, Whitney. I don't think I ever will be. I mean it has given me the chance to transition and do other things that I would not have had a chance to do it if weren't for cancer, but \"over it,\" no, I agree I will never be able to say that. Please do make future posts. I try to encourage everyone to talk about their lives here, because we have a chronological recording showing a bunch of women that started chemo together, and are still here, so even if it is a child's birthday party, or more tests b/c of suspicious lumps, I would prefer it all be recorded here. We are helping so many by doing this, the altruism will long outlive our individual sagas with this disease. This group has helped us all, you are correct. I will continue to make efforts to keep us going here, largely b/c we are helping others; we are giving them hope and helping them look forward. The importance of this cannot be overstated. Thank you for your kind words, and thank you so, so, so very much for posting! I was so worried, but alas I have no recourse but to wait!!! I am just so glad you are doing well. If ever you want to recon, I have an excellent guy in Philly. Based on your recovery this time, I doubt you will, but should you change your mind, it is Dr. Au at Penn Med. Also Dr. Sirletti, also at Penn, is very good. Sptmm: Are you training for the NY Marathon? I forget if you are going to run it this year. I am likely going to start training in August for 2017. Hope to see you there! So ladies, we are in the throes of Spring, we are all still here, and we are all LUCKY!!!!!!! Enjoy the Spring, and remember to post once in a while, and it does not have to be about cancer. Let's make it not about cancer, how's that?! Seriously, tell us about your vacations, promotions, new haircuts, fab dress you got at Nordstrom on clearance! Just say something, say anything, but most importantly keep in touch, if not for anything else then to fortify this record for those yet to join us :) Happy trails and much love, ladies!

Iowa: 28 people and a pool party in Iowa at Christmas...now that is a good time!   Have fun!  That is going to be one crowded pool!!!  Joking...I know not everyone goes in at the same time...at least I hope not! Ginger: soo good to hear from you again.   I had the breathing thing, too, but not to the extent you did.  The girls on this thread have reminded me red blood cells being low can affect breathing but my blood work did not show anything.  The light-headedness can be caused by dehydration especially with you having lost so much weight in a few weeks.  Have you tried Ensure?  Even DanActive which is basically like liquid yogurt?  Mojo is largely used in reference to sex drive!   I think the tree being up is a big help!   The lights will cheer you up.  I hope you start to see more progress and your numbness subsides.  Best of luck to you and I am glad you checked in again. Zenith: what is wrong?  You don't like bug spray for Xmas dinner?!??!  I know what you mean.  This week is #5..gross!  I will be back in bug sprayville for 2 weeks!   Almost done, almost done...we must remind ourselves we are just about over all this mess.  I hope you have a good Sunday. Libraylil: don't forget, as Tex told me, taste buds only last 10 days.  There are like 10,000 taste buds on our tongue (after Tex told me that I had to do some research) and they just fall off.  If you brush your tongue (good way to avoid bad breath!) that will help them move on!   Unfortunately we never know what day we are on unless we trace back to our date of birth and count a plethora of 10 day increments!  In any case, thankfully they are short-lived! Rachel: I would encourage to try to avoid reading other women's experience with tamoxifen b/c, like you said, everyone is different and so, so many women are having zero SE with Tamoxifen that you might want to hold off and wait to see what your own experience is.  As for fizzy water, plain seltzer/club soda or Perrier is all I can tolerate these days.  I still do 1 part NON-diet Ginger Ale and 4 parts seltzer and that is ok.  You could definitely make a strange 12 Days of Christmas song with what we are going through!   I did not know rads required a bunch of water also.  Why is it that so many people tel me to add Crystal-would-like-some-cancer-causing-agents-Light (!!!) to my water?!?!   That stuff is filled with phenylketoneurics!   Stick with your water and good luck on Tamoxifen. Calamtykel: counting blessings is the best thing you can do.   Honestly, I think of cancer like a flu: they have no cure but they can treat it.  I don't really think about it going forward.  Who knows what the future holds?  Just keep living your life and forget about those things you can't control. Well, I have a little shopping to do and I want to get the Sunday paper so I can peruse some flyers!   I have some more gross chemo this week...ugh!   Oh well....I must persevere!    Happy Sunday all!",

Thanks also for helping me keep the bleeding business in perspective! Again, I am so glad about your news. Good for you. I was sending you positive vibes all day yesterday but was so knocked out after going back to Yale for Neulasta and doing a little shopping I fell asleep at 5:30 last night and woke at 11! It felt good but, in any case, I was very happy to read your news today. Such good news. Have a LOVELY day...but don't run! Omaz: good for you with the walking trail and for *pushing* yourself to finish. I am very, very proud of you! It is wonderful that you are getting a mile done just 2 weeks past treatment! You should pat yourself on the back, woman! Iowa: glad the diuretic helped. I know I have some lacix around here but I am not going to bother until chemo is over. Question: when you speak of markers and Elizabeth Edwards, exactly what does \"marker\" mean? Either chemo brain has evicted it from the short-term file in my brain or I was never clear on it! Just wondering...is this the ER, PR, HER results? Is that what markers are? Just wondering. Lady: well put on Elizabeth Edwards. She really did sacrifice a lot and she seemed to be a lovely person. I was watching a \"Nightline\" piece on her last night and she really devoted a lot of time and effort to advancing research on bc. There was more that I wanted to share about that story but it has left my mind! Also, I will try the Afrin. I am going to CVS shortly. Rachel: I look forward to my liver and kidney bloodwork results and am always happy to see they are fine. I am glad, you too, are doing well with that. Walking twice per day is great. It does increase energy. I am still riding that recumbent bike but not as much as I was when I first started chemo. Only 1 tx to go and I am done so am looking very forward to getting back to normal workouts over the Jan to Feb stretch. I just built my home gym around Feb-April this year and the bc drama started in March. I really have not had much chance to use it. Here's to January! Zenith: That is wonderful you have come to love your little dog! That is such good news! They are such good company. We are getting snow here as well. I am glad your DH keeps shovels out a path for the dog. Good on the union dues, bad on the life insurance! I can only imagine what premiums would be like now if you had to get a NEW policy! I don't even think they will talk to us anymore! Libraylil: Maybe it is not the last tx but the weather that is knocking you out?! A friend just moved from CT to TN and is wildly upset she has gotten MORE SNOW than we have in CT! About Zahra, that story has rented space in my head. I could go on line and peruse the local papers but primarily I was exposed, and did get exposed to the story, through Nancy Grace. You are absolutely correct in how many people would have adopted her. I am still very suspicious as to what precipitated that man in the UK to, seemingly arbitrarily, send her wicked stepmother $10K. There is something rotten in the cotton with that. So now that the other 2 passed the polygraph we are back to her father and stepwitch. That story just breaks my heart. On the bleeding, I have no remedies. I really don't know what to do. I hope you have a nice weekend of shopping at the shore. Relax and enjoy! Sweeney: HAPPY TRAILS! I hope you enjoy the DR. A friend goes every few years. He loves it. I have never been. You got a good deal and I think it will be very good for you so I wish you fun times and some nice, warm weather to enjoy! Don't forget, us bc girls need that vitamin D! Ginger: great on the nose stopping bleeding. I agree with you on the breathlessness and it being 100% a chemo side effect. It makes me nervous as well. Your MUGA results were great, btw. That is very good. Continue to do research on anything new, and although efficacy is not yet proven, surely they are on to something so why not try?! Hopefully your numbness abates soon. Positive vibes to you on that. Sptmm: Someone on NPR was talking about the year following the end of chemo and rads and how it is easy to be very concerned with every ache and pain. We can easily get carried away and that is natural. Don't forget, however, cancer does not hurt. It does not show any outward signs generally and this is why it also has the dubious title of \"the silent killer.\" For this reason, we have to stay on our follow-ups but that is about it. There is not much more we can do. I, too, feel I am going to but unusually concerned with any odd stuff but I think as the days go by, we will take it more in stride. I do know what you mean, however. I have a very good, long-term relationship with my GP and I love him. He is a great doctor with a huge practice filled with patients who adore him. I am blessed to have this and I think he will help me keep things in perspective going forward. I hope we all can find talented, caring doctors like my GP to keep us from spiraling going forward. In the end, Deb, we are all in this together, having the same concerns and worried about over-responding to the \"little stuff.\" We will get through it! Adey: good luck tomorrow. Hope all goes well and you don't have too many SE. I will look forward to your update! BTW, I got gross A yesterday! Well, I have a few more things to do before my luscious TAC takes me down! Good day to all-",

Sweeney: never mind what you will look like on the beach!  Just focus on how you will feel better after exercising.  Just do it for 10 or 20 minutes and watch tv.   That is what I do.  I have the recumbent bike in my office and I watch CNBC while I ride!  Or basketball or blah blah!   Just listen to some music or watch tv.  It will fly by but don't force yourself to do too much or ride hard.  Just take it easy.  Don't forget, before getting on the bike you were sitting so even a modicum of effort will have a good result",

Calamtykel: and now you are running about in androgynous mode wondering why you are being stopped in your tracks?!?!?   Perhaps 7  lbs of make-up and a bustier will alay their fears and make you readily identifiable!!!!   You can also get some botchulism shot in your lips!!!!  It is so disgusting what women do these days...just grotesque...no one wants to grow up and look their age and the longer they feed this mysogynistic machine, the bigger it shall grow.   It will never end if women don't stop the madness and just look their age.   What was hilarious was Meg Ryan in the Middle East talking to women about their rights and education with her dumbo, bee-stung, puffed up lips...imbecile.  I was so disgusted.  These women are sitting their looking at jerko trying to be the epitome of the controlled female specimen with nothing beyond a burning sense of aesthetics to show for herself about rising above it all and embracing your place in the world!  Ridiculous.   In any case, I think they were just being cautious with you and I am glad they were being so. In any case, time for Nancy Grace!   Carry on chemosabes! ",

BC is wicked serious and scary. We all support each other and are very positive about the steps we have taken to ameliorate the situation but this is definitely something you need not call yourself a whiner about. Definitely focus on the fact that there was some shrinkage. Quite frankly, I would have been more concerned if they did not find it etc... Be happy they see it, it is on the radar, they know *exactly* where they are cutting and they know the shape, size etc... You can definitely take solace in that. Also, just take it easy. Don't be worried about the sleeping. Relax, curl up, enjoy the dog and what I refer to as my favorite movie: the inside of my eyelids! I do sleep and I don't fight it. All of the sudden, like my energy will drop off a cliff like Roadrunner. I go take a nap and get up and get back to what I was doing. You have to work with your body right now. Don't force the Wii or anything for that matter. Relax, get yourself ready for surgery, keep a good frame of mind and give yourself a month to deal with all this crap rather than be worried you are resting. Rest is the body's way of creating energy for when you are awake. Your body is under assault between chemo, the impending surgery (mental duress), the impending radiation (more mental), and the changes these things connote. Just relax....give yourself a break for Christmas! Calamtykel: I totally can't wait to get that damn thing out! I don't like to complain but I have not been comfortable with it especially because it snakes into a vein in my neck...don't like this. I hope the dog loves the Christmas treats! Nap it up, sister! Naps are way good!!! Rachel: congratulations on moving one step closer with your CT simulation. I hope all goes well and you are on the road to becoming a true RADICAL soon enough! Ckptry: Happy Birthday to your son.  I am glad you are having the party at the gym but please, make frequent trips outside for fresh air.  You are brave, woman! Zenith: congratulations on your last tx! What a nice Christmas gift. Sptmm: I actually went to game night at my best friend's house last night and it was fun! I have not been in months but no one was sick/had been sick recently so I figured a night of Boggle and good friends was in order. YAY! It was fun. I also did a little shopping so, in long, a little time out was good. I hope your son's team had a good game and that you bought *yourself* something at the outlets! I am feeling a bit more energy these past few days.  It feels really good.  I am not totally knocked out by the slightest things.  Hopefully this will last.  I am cautiously optimistic about this.  I am hopeful if I ride the recumbent bike for 1/2 hour each day I can parlay this into a bit more energy and actually feel like a human being instead of a zombie through the holidays. Good day to you all and each and everyone one of you should buy yourself a nice, beautiful gift for all you have been through this year ;)  I am being totally honest when I say I bought myself nice, nice gifts this year!  I have had some fun this season!! he he he !",

Iowa: I had a bmx and will have rads.  I have to have rads (well they strongly encourage it) because I am a stage IIb and because my sentinel node was completely eradicated by bc, leaving no trace of node at all but rather became 100% bc with extra-capillary extension.  I also had 2 dirty nodes that they know of with a total of 18 removed.  Is there a reason why they want you to have rads?  With a stage 1, clean nodes and a bmx, I guess they want you to do rads because of being HER2+?   I am sure that is what it is.  For me it is my bedraggled node involvement! I saw an old friend at Target last night and when I told him what I had been through this year, he remarked his mother had been through bc and that was 13 years ago.  He said she started with a lump and went bmx and is now 83!!!!!  He said she lived to 83 because it had not reached her nodes.  Of course, moments later when I told him it got into my nodes he looked like he should be helping me write my epitaph!!  Suddenly, in that moment, I realized that I guess people view me as being a lot more sick than I think I am.   I don't think that 2 dirty nodes means I am relegated to death soon but perhaps it does?  Perhaps getting into the nodes is as bad as people say.  I just don't see it that way.  I don't like to talk to a lot of people about my cancer because they all have preconceived notions, unsolicited advice, pity and sympathy.  They all also remind me, be it with their eyes, their mannerisms, their overall demeanor that I should be preparing for death in some way.  I just don't feel that at all.  I don't think bc is the death sentence it once was and I don't think 2 dirty nodes means I am definitely going to die soon of bc mets.  I guess I just don't see things the way the rest of the world does...thankfully! More to this point, girls, I think keeping our social circles small, our stresses smaller and our hearts big and filled with hope is the recipe for living and not dying.  If you think about it, every person on this planet is dying every day so make sure you live every day because you never know what is going to take you, when it is going to take you and how long this trip is.  I hope you all have sweet dreams ;)",

All things considered I am probably looking at a few more days in but so be it. At least when I leave this will be under control. Also I got the surprise of my life today: my PS popped his head in! Yesterday he was on vacation and I guess he was scheduled to come home today. I really did not expect to see him, so not only was it a pleasant surprise but, it was also so nice to know he is here in case the TE has to be removed etc... . Omaz: your post about the walk was funny in a moderately sad way! I also heard good stuff about Armstrong's book. If it is that good I will pick it up. Let me know. Lisasinglem: That is such GREAT news! You must be euphoric. I look forward to your posts about how you are doing post-chemo because you live in one of the most beautiful, albeit hilly, cities. I knew the breathlessness with chemo must have driven you bananas simply based on your location. I am so happy you were able to do a workout again. That is just great. Calamtykel: hot flashes! That is pretty much why I did not realize this boob was getting infected because in the middle of the night when I wake up with hot flashes, throwing the covers off, on goes the fan, I was not aware I was spiking fevers as well. As for the arm pain, it might just be the muscles adhering to the tissues and nerves, reestablishing connection once again and finding it\u2018s place again. I imagine this might take a few weeks but then again, this is just an idea. Ann97: Is it my imagination or were you the very same woman who thought she would never make 4 miles again only a few weeks ago?! WOW....you put that goal quickly behind you! Good for you. What a feeling of a sense of accomplishment. I must say, however, drooling over hair is a bit of a caveat! Seriously, the hair takes the longest to come back for most...or at least to reach a point of satisfaction with it. I am not even done, still have 1 to go and I have pieces over my ears that are 2+\" long and the rest is in less varying lengths. It looks fab! JoyKK: fruits, vegetables (not cooked in butter, oil, fried etc...) steamed and good ol' granny smith's with a cup of black coffee will help the water get out. Beyond that, the conversation on water consumption vs. retention looms long and large as it always has. Sptmm: How did it go today? Thinking of you and hoping you had success. Rachel: Like most meds, it is probably ok if you miss 1 day. We are all going to miss one day occasionally for reasons unknown. You do need to ask your doc but they will probably tell you to just take the next one at regularly scheduled time. The headache could be connected if you missed it perhaps but I might look to the kids being home first! As for me, the swelling is going down the slightest bit and the color is getting slightly better. I also slept today for like 4 hours! That felt great because last night it was 1.5 hours. I am glad to be here, in capable hands and getting this thing under control. All: thanks for your concern-it means the world to me. OK, well, I am actually eating regular food again....not a lot but enough. I am going to have some cereal. Have a good night all. PS-finally got the port accessed and things are looking up! This also means I can bend my arm again so I am 2 handed typing again!",

The glands in our neck are actually nodes. Nodes are designed to filter out junk, as we all know. There are so many reasons this could be swollen. It is on the unaffected side, correct? Meaning on the side where you did not have bc, right? It is the waiting that sucks. It really is. I say thank God for Xanax because I could never take this crap in stride. I am glad you got it so you can sleep until this is over. I guess each time we develop more tools and an ability to deal with this poking, prodding and testing every anomaly seemingly into perpetuity. It is our collective new reality.  For instance, I used to hate going to the dentist but I have the best dentist, going on 12 years now, and I love going. He puts me at ease and no matter what is going on with my chops, I trust he can handle it, will entertain me while I am there and I will feel nothing!  I am no longer bothered by going to the dentist. Eventually, I am sure, I will have the same feeling about going to all the bc docs. The news might not be good but hopefully their professionalism and talent will put me at ease. I certainly wish you the best. Libraylil: I thought the lumpectomy would cause some moderate change in the appearance of the breast. I think the only think rads does is dry out the skin a bit so the appearance may change a bit more. That was how it was explained to me when they talked about lumpectomy with the subsequent requirement of rads if I went in that direction. Sptmm: I just got a small snowblower. I did not want to deal with the big ones between the shaking from the size of the machine and being out in the cold = no way! I just wanted a small one for quick clean up after the plow clean up. I did not know that we could not shovel after surgery for fear it might cause LE? I still like to lift weights and can't imagine why shoveling is off the menu relative to potentially causing LE. In any case, if it is a story you made up to get the kids shoveling, kudos! Jarvier Bardem is on Conan....I must tune in!!!",

You will probably feel pretty good w/in 7 days of the surgery.   Start some moderate range of motion exercises for your arms as soon as you feel well enough to do so.  As for muscle, they did not have to remove any from me.  Following up with rads is great.   I think you will do pretty well with chemo then a bmx and rads.   I would not worry too much about the muscle.  First the cancer attached to it so it has to go but, and more importantly, I think your muscle might grow back and reattach itself or patch the hole, per se.   I am not sure about that but I know muscle repairs itself over time.    If you need anything, PM me.  I will be glad to tell all I know!  Rachel and Kel: glad you two are in the clear and got happy results from your tests and biopsy results.   Good stuff. Well, I am the last house on a dead end  which is code hockey rink these days.  I have to try to get out of my driveway, onto the big 70' patch of ice that is the end of the road and try to navigate to get to the pavement all so I can go to the bank.   Good times, man!  Plus there is a total of about 6' of navigable space on the road in between the 10' snow piles.  I have not seen snow like this in CT in over 15 years.",

This means that women who take tamoxifen may derive many of the beneficial effects of menopausal estrogen replacement therapy, such as a decreased risk of osteoporosis. I also learned about: tamoxifen and another drug, raloxifene, are equally effective in reducing invasive breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk of the disease.   Raloxifene is a drug approved by the FDA for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene is also approved by the FDA for reducing the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer.",

This means super low fat, high protein and vegetables in the raw. All sorts of vegetables, tossed right on the grill, are great just as they are.

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2011 09:06PM - edited Feb 12, 2011 09:07PM by 1WonderWoman The services for my BIL were very well done and, overall, it was about as good as could be expected. My heart breaks for my sister, however. Some inspirational news for all of us: my sister's SIL is a 6 yr bc survivor! She had a lumpectomy, no chemo, just radiation and she is doing very well. She was a Stage I so her story is a bit different than some of our's but nonetheless she is doing well.  She also had the oncatype-dx testing and she came back low so she felt comfortable foregoing chemo.  Has anyone else had oncatype testing?  I would be curious to know where I stand on that. Iowa: that sounds like quite an issue you are confronted with. I sure hope there is an easy fix because, and as you pointed out, all these little issues are tiresome. Hopefully it is something a chiropractor can fix. It does sound nerve-related. I wish you the best with that. Keep us posted. Omaz: that is a shame about the LE. Nothing good about that news. How did you see it? Was your arm swelling? I just recently found out that rads can cause LE. I am not going to be able to get rads, even though I should, because of this infection and I am not too worried about it now. How is the sleeve working for you? What exactly does it do? I wish you well with this latest challenge. Calamtykel: I meant to tell you were are the same age. I will be 41 in March. We are both premenopausal. I get my tamoxifen rx on the 23rd. I am really hoping I don't have trouble with it. My sister's SIL who had bc just finished 5 years on tamox and is now on Femara. She was not bothered by tamoxifen but there are a lot of women who have problems with it. In any case, I hope you are doing ok these days and working on an alternative to tamoxifen. Texas: where are you? We miss you. Hope you are well. Sptmm: I know we are at *risk* for LE after having nodes removed but what gets it started? I mean has anyone pinpointed what we might do to inadvertently trigger it? I bet \"they\" don't know what we could do to trigger it but it sure would be nice to know. Like eat more Vitamin C and don't sprint or something, you know? We are just given these scary scenarios and not told how/if we can do anything to help ourselves avoid them. To me, after all these years and C research, that is a bummer. When I talked to the onc peeps about getting a tattoo on the left arm about no bp/blood draws they reminded me I cannot get a tattoo b/c of the needles involved (I don't have one and never considered that aspect) and furthermore if I am rushed into a hospital (I was worried about the ER using that arm if I was rushed in after an accident, for instance) they will do whatever to keep me alive. I don't agree with that line of thinking. I don't agree that they should just stab up my arm and cause me LE but hey, I will still be alive. There should be easier ways to avoid inadvertent emergency use of our affected arms. I swear, one of these days next to those store cards on our key rings is going to be a medical fob. It has got to happen. Sweeney: how are you? Getting energy back after your first few weeks on the job? I hope you are doing well. Keep us posted. Something strange: since I had chemo, when I turn my head from left to right, I can hear the sounds of my neck, as I move my head.  It is like suddenly I am eligible to hear the sounds inside my body when I turn my head.....it is so very weird.  I am not bringing this up with my docs as I will be living at the hospital, being studied, along with the other animals!  This was a long 3 days and I am very tired. I will be going to bed for long winter's rest tonight. I really feel bad for my sister and, in the end, it appears to have been a blood clot that caused the heart attack. A terrible shame at that. I thank you all, again, for your well-wishes and concern. It was very nice to have such support at such an awful time. I hope you all are having a lovely night-",

Texas: I don't know how you do it with the kids and all but, as I have said before, you are some sort of wonder woman!   An old friend of mine used to say busy people get more done and when I listen to you and what you get done, I have a tendency to believe my old friend!  I am not the best at managing my time these days and I still space out a bit.  I am just over 3 weeks post my last tx so perhaps I will get it together soon!   Best of luck to you and I am sure you will do fine on the entrance exam.  A lot of those exams are for placement purposes also and not to preclude you from the program. If something is weak they will usually accept you and place you in a remedial course for the weakness.  Don't worry :) Calamtykel: thinking of you and wondering how you are doing.  Stop by and let us know you are ok.  ",

As follows: The U.S. House of Representatives just passed a budget that is devastating to the fight against cancer. It will mean more lives lost and more suffering from this terrible disease. Now, the Senate must pass its budget and its critical that we restore funding for lifesaving cancer prevention and early detection programs. But to succeed, we need more people to take action. Will you take just 30 seconds to sign this online petition? We can't let Congress jeopardize all the advancements we've made.

Tamoxifen Citrate (or something like that!) is the brand name. I am hoping things go well. I am going to have to watch for my hormonal reactions, of course!!!!! Whoo hoo.....let the games begin!!!! He he he! Rachel: what your MO told you is pretty much what my APRN said yesterday as I told her I think I am getting a little berserk post-chemo thinking every pain is mets! She said that post-chemo it is very natural to feel scared and attempt to over-diagnose every little issue and that we are naturally, after going through all of the bc business, much more aware and in tune with our bodies. Yes, every ache and pain! I feel 80 as well...ugh. As for your feet, I would get one of those foot bath with the rollers in the bottom. Could not hurt and will undoubtedly feel good! My treadmill is in the basement and now my new excuse is too cold to go down there and now my new counter-excuse is you will heat up once you get moving! I have to start today. BTW, isn't estrogen good for our skin? Does this mean we are going to both LOOK and feel 80?! Thanks, bc! Texas: Everyone, even martians, want to go to Texas! That guy was sooo funny! I never forgot his very sharp sense of humor but certainly that comment was the highlight of my interactions with him! Mommichelle: I keep telling my friend soon they can me \"Louzabeth\" and, of course, \"Lou\" would become my abbreviated name! Between chemo, no hair, the lack of estrogen and the steroids (so glad that mess is done!), I will soon be in the beginning stages of becoming a man short of the parts! We are a hot bunch! Alas I also have the dubious experience of both having no boobs and now a hole where my left one used to be! So much joy....I wonder if my \"s\" life will ever be even remotely normal again... Sptmm: you hit the nail on the head, sister! I was just complaining that working out causes more aches and pains than I had before! That is so funny! It is a cruel joke from nature that the older we get, the more we need to work out and, unlike in our 20's, the body says no with the aches and pains that start as you move more! I can't tell you the enormous respect I have for those 60 y/o I see jogging now! Lisasinglem: NO TRIP TO BRAZIL?! I was all prepared to live vicariously through you! I guess I have to go back to living through my friend's husband who is about to buy a modified, midlife crisis car = a Saab convertible! He was looking at the Solstice, however! Lady: we are all here for you. Pour yourself into anything you enjoy and try to keep your mind as busy as possible. Also laugh as much as possible as that is medicine for the soul. Enjoy your lake house and don't think about much else. Finally, I was looking up the side effects of tamoxifen and at this site www.imaginis.com/breast-health... I found this chart which compares the conditions of those of us on tamoxifen vs. women not on tamoxifen. I thought it was helpful and perhaps you all will find it the same! Condition Incidence in women taking tamoxifen Incidence in women not taking tamoxifen Endometrial cancer 2.29/1000 cases annually 0.92/1000 cases annually Pulmonary embolism 0.75/1000 cases annually 0.25/1000 cases annually Deep-vein thrombosis 1.26/1000 cases annually 0.79/1000 cases annually Stroke 1.43/1000 cases annually 1.00/1000 cases annually Cataract 25.41/1000 cases annually 22.51/1000 cases annually Cataract surgery 46.62/1000 cases annually 31.43/1000 cases annually Good day, girls-",

It is so weird! It is just nice to feel some hair coming back. Mmahle: nice to hear from you again. I sure hope the CT scan shows nothing and perhaps the headaches are precipitated by a changed in diet like consuming more caffeine, for example. Let us know what the results are as soon as you here. Thanks for stopping by again! BTW, my brother lives in Houston. He seems to really like it. Also, on the headaches, if it is tension, I just started doing yoga again. The restorative effects of yoga cannot be overstated. I have \"Living Arts AM and PM Yoga.\" They are 20 minute beginner discs. I have been told time and time again about the benefits of yoga, which I have done for years on and off anyway, post bc and chemo. You might want to try those brief sessions. JSW: glad you are feeling well. I know you mentioned you might have the final path results on Monday and, even if it is not Monday, be sure to let us know. I think I speak for all of us when I say we will be thinking of you. Also, congrats to your DH on his new job and to you on the move. I will probably be heading to FL about the time you are leaving! That is so weird you mention alcohol! I have been really thinking about having a white Russian! We are coming into summer also and I love Bud Limes! So exciting to be able to drink again...even though I have not actually done it! Omaz: how are you doing? Finding out anything new about the LE? I started lifting some 5 lb weights and doing yoga again. I cannot believe how weak my arms have gotten. I have trouble opening a Gatorade bottle and I also feel like there is some \"chording\" in the bc side arm. I am just hoping for no LE. I want to do some pulldowns again and do pec deck...I want to get back in shape that is! Starting slow though. You scared me with the LE business and I decided I better get moving before fluid starts to get trapped in that arm. Texas: if my mother saw that pic she would tell me I should be embarrassed and that it looks like rats had been chewing on my hair all night!!!!! I just have this new desktop and I am having so much trouble getting stuff off my Palm and Blackberry and, to be honest, I don't have time for that \"s!!!\" That is a pre-baldy shot. I am not one to celebrate my bald head! As for the TEAS url, thanks a lot. That is helpful. I have a math one for you and what is cool is you can choose your weak spots to be quizzed on, as follows: http://www.thatquiz.org/ Hope it helps. Take notice as at the bottom there is an \"anatomy\" link. I have not even checked that out yet. I would totally see about bringing your son with you. I am sure you are not the only mom who has been in this situation. Take him along. I hope the hospital gives you some options. I am really surprised they don't have a daycare on prem. Sadly daycare does not seem to want to cut anyone a break. A young single mother I worked with was spending roughly 35% of her pay on daycare. It is crazy. Sptmm: how was the soccer tournament? I hope you had some fun. We finally have some decent weather coming up after tomorrow night's little snow treat! I just can't wait for spring. Libraylil: you are gonna be one hot momma with the boots and the scrappy gown! Yowza!!!! I am going to take one of my early evening naps. I only got 4 hours sleep last night, turned the heat down to 55 because good ol' tamox was turning up my heat and then I put the fan on in my bedroom! I need a little nap before I make turkey meatloaf! Love it with red peppers, onions, mushrooms, sweet baby rays bbq sauce, garlic salt, pepper, a little tobasco, worchesteshire sauce, a little A1 and some onion powder for good measure! Sooo good! I am also the most boring person I know as I cancelled plans tonight because I am too tired and I want to stay in, cook and watch tv! Either this cold weather has gotten to me or I am just growing into a bore! Good night all-",

A stomach bug on top of what you are already going through just plain, old sucks. I think you just have so much on your mind and with what you are going through, your defenses are down and so something like a stomach flu could sneak up on you. May you get over this stomach bug immediately! Omaz: I wonder if there is any link between BRCA+ and the potential to develop ovarian cancer? JSW: it has been hard for me to sleep since tamox. I am getting to sleep at 4ish, getting up at 9 (in addition to getting up several times during that 5 hours) and then I go back to sleep for a few more hours. I really need to get as close to 8 as possible, no matter how fragmented. In any case, I was getting all upset because now I am getting up at 12-1ish and I just decided to not worry about it and to just base my day from 1ish to the time I go to bed and don't get so worked up about it. I think we can really stress ourselves out if we are not sleeping when we deem sleep \"should\" be taking place. If you are not working, take it easy and sleep when you can. I am looking forward to a normal sleep schedule again but, for now, I am just going to sleep when I can and not get too concerned about it for now. The weirdest thing: most days now I eat breakfast later than when I used to eat lunch!!! What a life! Adey: you missed the best part on SNL which was in the beginning, Bill Hader was doing Charlie Sheen and mock interview of all of those \"winning\" which was Hosni Mubarak, Muammar Gaddafi, Lindsay Lohan and there was one more! It was beyond hysterical! The best I have seen on SNL in a long time. Well, I am going to do a few more things and watch \"Entourage\" and then try to get to bed by 2, shut the tv off and try to hit the hay a little earlier tonight!  BTW, there was just some big study about the use of portable electronic devices close to be time and how it is causing sleeplessness.  I forget why!!! Big deal Wednesday: I have my annual gyn appointment :(   Here we freakin' go.  Poking and prodding, looking for more cancer hiding places.  I just remembered when I was filling out their bring-it-with-you paperwork that I had a suspicion of some cervical nonsense about 13 years ago, had a :colposcopy and all was clear.  I am only pretty sure they will be revving up that hunt-it-up machine to see what is going on there!  I am so not looking forward to all this crap.  Here we go....ah-gain! ",

Banned from research in 1977, it was discovered that this vitamin produces a type of cyanide in the body. According to previous research done, prior to this ban, the cyanide that vitamin B17 produces, only affects cancerous cells. This is due largely in part to the fact that yet another enzyme created by the vitamin protects cells that are non-cancerous, and deactivates the cyanide's affects on healthy cells. It would appear from this research that, in essence, this means that vitamin B17 is truly the only natural cancer killing substance. What Can We Do? Just because it is unlawful to prescribe vitamin B17 here in the United States, that does not mean that there is no way for you to get the amazing benefits of this vitamin in your system.

Debbie and Michelle: thanks so much for the update!  I am glad for Michelle that you just had a little minor fatigue days 4 and 5 and for Debbie, I hope you enjoyed that ice cream with your son!  Good luck to you both as we will all be joining you soon enough!

When you went for your walk you increase your blood pressure and cardio which makes chemo go through your body that much faster.   Everything we do to increase the rate at which our heart is working is going to increase the rate at which chemo travels so perhaps try the treadmill.  Of course there is always walking slower but that SUX, too, especially when you are used to walking the beach at a certain pace.  I feel for you, woman!  I have been there.  Sorry that had to happen to you but I still think you look fantastic without your fur so take solace in that and gaze at yourself in the mirror!!!!!!!

Omaz: you have got it right...definitely exercise but just a little less than usual.  I honestly think because chemo takes so long that we will all probably reach our pre-chemo workouts before chemo is over but in the initial stages ease on in!  Good stuff, good talk!

On to more important topics: LIP BALM!   Burt's Bees is good, I agree but what is excellent, but perhaps a little too fruity for your tastes is Lancome's Juicy Tubes!!!!! I am going to get another one today.  They blanket your lips in unbelievable, unparalleled moisture.  While I am at Macy's I will ask if they have an unflavored one and will let you know.  Otherwise you can check online yourself.  I am so addicted to these Juicy Tubes!!!!!  I crave them! Update from me, your fearless leader who now not so secretively has let you all know she fears chemo brain (all type A's fear chemo brain!!!!!!!!!!) :  saw my new onc today and will have mugga, cat scan, pet scan, port and I am going to start somewhere around the 20th or so.   The person driving this bus will finally join the passengers in their quest for victory!!  Midweek update: will be done by midnight!  For all who started this week I dedicate AC/DC's \"For those about to Rock\"...we salute you!!!!!!!!!!  For those who are Yankee fans, and that should be everyone (!), you should also embrace the Mariano Rivera assigned-theme by Metallica of \"Enter Sandman\" as we are going to SHUT OUT bc forever and send it off to never-never land!!  Yeah, I like Metal but I also like Pavarotti...go figure!!!!!!

Even after the advent of anesthetics such emergency surgery has had to be performed at times.  Particularly in times of war when anesthetics may be in limited supply or unavailable.  To ease the pain the patient was given a couple of stiff belts of whiskey to numb the senses, then given a stick or lead bullet to bite down on as the surgeon went to work with knife and saw.  The bullet or stick was given to let the patient focus their energy and attention on the biting instead of the cutting and pain.   It may also have helped to reduce the screaming, which probably benefited the surgeon and attendants. &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& My, my...we have come a long way!!!!!!

I explained my BS wanted me to have chemo there b/c it is close.  In the end, their collective recalcatrance leads me to believe it was sour grapes b/c I did not bmx at that hospital and fired that surgeon.  I cannot believe how juvenile and pathetic people that call themselves doctors were being....blackballing a bc patient?!   Now I could be wrong but how many of you went to onc's who's staff never returns calls, never set up scans and 1 month later calls to say they are worried about how long it has been since they heard from you!?  Likewise!  It is really, really gross that medical oaths seemed to be tossed and childish behavior prevailed.  An ex of mine who is a heart surgeon in NYC said I should write to the AMA about this....perhaps I will. In any case, that is the long story of a professional outfit that robbed me of 1 month while playing stupid games with a bc patient.  I had to get restarted at Yale and now the scans will finally get started and I will get going but I can't get back the month I lost between July and August.  It is really grotesque when I think about it. Needless to say, and sadly, I am looking forward to getting started!  It is nearly 2 mos since my bmx and with an aggressive cancer that totally took over my sentinel node leaving no evidence of a node in it's wake and made that node 100% cancer, I am a little concerned about putting off chemo for much longer.  And so it goes, I guess?! So here is to purple hair and no 3rd eye!!!!!!   I took you out of the \"on deck\" circle and put you back on TBA with me!   More time to buy wigs and learn that, as someone else mentioned this, tricky scarf knot!!!!!!  Good times, good stuff!

      "Content": "Oct 8, 2016 02:38PM - edited Oct 8, 2016 03:03PM by 1WonderWoman Helloooo Warriors! I felt compelled to share some information with you all, as this nursing education is giving me so much good info, I just could not help but pass it on: Angiogenesis means food that promote blood vessel growth. Anything that we eat that promotes the development of new blood vessels is cancer's BFF. Cancer loves to grow, we all know this. That said, foods and herbs that are antiangiogenetic are what every person with cancer should be consuming copious amounts of. All kinds of berries---strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries---all anti-angiogenetic. Cherries are as well, and in our part of the country, now that the fresh ones are out of their very short season, the dried ones will do. Kale chips are a great way to get kale in us, in an somewhat tasty way (I cannot lie!), but this, too, is anti-angiogenetic. Freezing red grapes make for a great treat, and having green tea with nutmeg is, again, a very easy way to get anti-angiogenetic food. Eat as much garlic, artichokes, tomatoes, ideally in a salad form, sprinkled with as much turmeric and parsley you can tolerate, and this is the backbone of one of the best anti-angiogenetic salads a person can ever consume. There is also the luscious roasted garlic---eat as much as you can! All of these foods starve out cancer, and will stop its very deleterious proliferation. Research anti-angiogenetic food, as labs all over the world are preparing to put it in a pill form, but until that happens, help your loved ones EAT TO LIVE! BTW, just in case anyone is wondering about antiangiogenesis, there is something called chondroitin sulfate, that is naturally occurring in cartilage. Chondroitin sulfate negates the development of blood vessels in cartilage, which is also why we can enjoy so many sports and activities that we do. Basically our cartilage has no nerves either, so it does not feel anything. It is in the study of chondroitin sulfate that the great medical minds found hope in something that is naturally occurring in our cartilage, but that which also can potentially stop cancer in its wicked tracks. I have never learned so much about the human body, and I remain in awe of what I am learning every day. It is an amazing machine, and if you ever thought our body makes everything we need to survive, you could not be more right. ******************************** Happy trails, ladies :)",

In any case, best of luck to you all and I hope this information helped.  I wish, wish, wish I found this thing before I had my bmx!  You can also find it at Amazon and a bunch of other places. Good luck, girls-I know it is a tough decision but in retrospect I have zero regrets. BTW, and in case that link does not work, just google Brookstone n-a-p Massaging Bed Rest.  It even has a cup holder, light for reading and remote holder!   I think I will get one anyway!!!  ",

Sassa-good points on my muscles being in better shape because, and as I am sure most of you know, when you lift weight you are tearing the muscle and forcing it to regrow, larger.  You are in essence ripping it open and forcing it to close the space you have made so the muscle creates new skin and then you tear it down again the next time you lift.   This is the beauty of weight lifting!  I am glad the muscle tone helped your PS also.   Good news...geez, I am a mess!  So much on my mind.. Thanks to you all for responding.   I am sure my mind is busy at work creating my next \"bananas\" line of questioning!",

I have a question for anyone that can answer: Pre-operatlively, did anyone from the hospital contact you all to explain what you could expect and how long you might be in, departure procedures, home health aides/visiting nurse etc... ???  For example, I found a camisole co online and starting dealing with a sales rep who subsequently sent a form to my doctor's office and they questioned me about why the forms were sent to them.  I explained I wanted to get camisoles for post-surgically and at that point it is imparted to me I will get those after surgery while I am in the hospital.  I am sure they may have mentioned this but why is it there is not more comprehensive, pre-operative dealing of ancillary issues BEFORE surgery?!  Just wondering what you all can tell me about this. I am giving \"good face\" but my mind is blown by this and when I am sitting in doctor's offices being given information, it is entirely feasible, even with notes, I missed the \"you will get post-surgery camisoles.\"  Is it just me or do they not realize we are somewhat incapacitated mentally, albeit temporarily, by this catastrophic news?  Please share your feelings- Liz",

      "Content": "May 8, 2010 08:45PM 1WonderWoman wrote: Sherry- Good question and I am going to answer, in full, in a lengthy that is going to be cathartic and perhaps not well accepted by some but so be it. This is my life and these are my reasons. Initially I need to point out my BS is a lovely woman, who is my age, and explained to me, in no uncertain, I have every option = lump, mx or bmx. I also must preface my reasoning with the fact that a good friend, Maureen, who's mom and sister died of bc, had a prophylactic mx. Finally, I saw my father dying a long, slow, miserable death from lung cancer and I even offered him one of my lungs. His was smoke-induced. If my father could have lived without his lungs, he would have gotten rid of them immediately. Now, I need my feet to walk and my eyes to see and my legs to transport me and my ears to hear but I DO NOT NEED MY BREASTS. They do NOTHING. They are simply coveted, with terribly misdirected interest, by those that find them enthralling. For this reason, many women have their entire identities tied up in these things. They are expendable. They decided to start trying to kill me so now they must go. Medically speaking, I was just about forced to do my first mammo at 38 years old. I don't like repeated exposure to even nominal amounts of radiation. So then I thought about the lumpectomy and the radiation requirement. IF the margins are not clear we have to start marching on now to mx and chemo etc.. Additionally, with an mx, if something is going on in the other breast the radiation option is now diminished. So now here I am *potentially* back in the medical industrial complex asking God \"why me\" and having more and more and more surgeries, pokes, prods etc... . Ideally let's say the lumpectomy worked for me, as it seems to have for Janet Reno. In any case, now, at 40 years old, if I live to 50 I have at least 20 mammograms to look forward to. I already said I did not like it to begin with so I don't want all that mess and why would I? I don't need my breasts; I am not milking anyone. So why would I want to go through all of this crap to keep my breasts that I don't need? Am I missing something? Additionally, the recurrence rate with lumpectomy is 10-15% or somewhere along those lines. Personally I, in my mind, think recurrence is more like 50% unless the cancer cells stand up and announce themselves when the surgeon cuts me open so she can't get every last one. Instead, cancer does not announce itself and us common folk believe when it gets some air at it, it likes to race around and hide , a like a kid on a steady diet of sugar. These scenarios are just too spooky for me. If it was my leg, I would have to do everything but these are boobs! I am also planning a hysterectomy next year so I don't give it anymore estrogen-friendly places to park it's miserable ass. Finally, the preponderance of women seem to be really enthralled with their boobs. I never loved mine. That is a very, very, very small part of this. What I would ask everyone who is hanging onto their breasts what precipitates their interest in doing so? Are they helping you breathe? What are they doing for you when you feel compelled to hang onto them especially when they are sick? Our breasts have decided, for reasons unknown, to manufacture cancer. On that note, I deeply suspect, like most twins, my breasts will share everything, including cancer. They say this one has been growing for 5 years. I am not waiting for find out if it is already in the other one. Why would I? Finally, I like working. I like the company I work for and I like the trading markets and our economy, with all it's gyrations. I don't want to be sitting in some hospital regularly because I could not get rid of my boobs. I have some living to do and even though all the hawkish might roll in about how bmx is not a ticket to cancer freedom, bmx is the best way I can bring my recurrence rate as low as possible. I like those odds.",

My feeling is if I get one more \"dirty\" mammo I would just elect surgery.  One of the other lurking thoughts I had is health insurance and my age.  I am 40...that is a long way from the \"natural\" end and with health insurance so front-and=center, and spiraling into a baby-boomer-aging abyss, I am concerned about being negated if I did not get a double.  I am still confused and with so many questions but your input is so collectively helpful, I can't even express it in words.  I will continue to ruminate!",

Right now I liken my breasts to old, burned out buildlings in the South Bronx that are loaded with junkies etc.. and the only way to permanently rectify the situation is to take down the buildings!  I feel at least in this way I have the best chance possible to avoid this happening again.  I like those odds.",

The stories have been wonderful and nothing short of great. Sweaty-It is so funny some of the things you point out about breasts and sex so I will address that now with a deeply personal anecdote: I was 18 and going out with this guy and, upon intimacy, he asked me, quite pointedly, if mine were \"alive\" or \"dead!!!!\"   After a bit of ambivalence, I answered my 19 yo boyfriend by saying \"they are dead!\"  I never had any response to them sexually..at all.  In addition, I like to work out and my breasts are large which is yet another issue for me.  I can't even really consider having 1 removed because is so large they would not match.   This part is a complete side bar but one I am sure you can all respect: I was at my brother's hockey game at like 8 years old and my mother was saying, quite jokingly, to her friend's, relative to the ice cold rink at 8AM, \"well, girls, at least we have knee warmers!\"  This is the other thing with this one now maligned watermelon hanging off of my chest is the fact that they are just cumbersome for me.  I don't love them and I never did.  When I used to run, in Central Park, I had to tape them down and use a sports bra.  In addition, as heterosexual as I am, I am so aggravated with the unnecessary level of male attention they are paid that saying goodbye is not such a problem for me.  It is the potential for necrosis, lymphedema (masectomy or not), questions about how they even find recurring BC if I have fake boobs and how I would adapt to the numbness.  In the end, however, I am still gathering information but am secretly looking forward to saying goodbye to them. I don't think I have the mental wherewithall to put a misplaced sense of concern on my deep ambivalence toward my breasts to begin with ahead of knowing that I have greatly, greatly reduced my chances of ever having this crap again...at least not in this form anyway!   I just don't think I can hang onto these, long-term, and keep going every 6 months for mammos to see if \"it is back.\"   That is too much for me especially when I don't love these jokers to begin with!   This thing getting sick on me is sort of like hanging onto a stock you didn't really like too much to begin with and this is the bad earnings report you needed to SELL!  Sorry...too many years in the financial industry!  I appreciate everyone's responses.  You all are such a collective, and deeply considerate, wealth of knowledge, I feel blessed.   At times I lament the lack of immediate family in the area etc...but I really prefer to do my own thing and the melodrama of my sister and brother lurking about, being scary about this dx, is too taxing in and of itself!   My mom is in a nursing home and barely speaks and my dad died of lung cancer (smoking related) some 10 years ago so I have friends and a strong will.   I may have breast cancer today but I could also be hit by a car tomorrow and we just don't know what is going to take us so we carry on.  BC is not the death knoll it once was and I am going to live until I am not living anymore :)",

I am sorry to sound so confused and lost but, no joke, I am lost.   I am confused beyond belief.  I just think taking my boobs off and afterwards finding out it has spread is just too much to bear all at once.  What would be the sense of removal of my breasts if it has spread.  I am certainly not clairvoyant therefore I am clueless as to what the results of this lymph business will be.  That is the stumbling block for me. ",
