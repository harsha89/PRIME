No body seems to be on the same cocktail as mine even though some of the diagnosis are similar. Anyone else on CMF? If so, ideas on what to expect? Is day 1 the worst or does it get progressive? I have heard that mine is supposed to be one of the milder chemos but they gave me 3 different scripts for side effects. One is decradon which nobody has made sound fun! I'm done with fill ups for expanders but I would have them on mondays so the muscle pain would subside by wed and I could teach (ballroom dancing) by thurs. Not sure how to plan chemo weeks (every 3 wks). ginagina- your cocktails look great! Just celebrated anniversary last night and had a great espresso martini. By the way anyone having trouble with coffee? I have heard that with some of the scripts it's suggested not to have. My morning cup is probably more of a ritual than a neccessity but I don't want to give it up. And all the problems I've been hearing with spicy food? I LOVE spicy! Gotta give that up too?",

I can see that I'm going to have to learn quite a few terms. I start my chemo 3/24. According to my doctors I'll probably have hair thinning but if I do loose it then I think I'd like to try wigs nothing like my hair. I'm a ballroom dancer and love the different rolls. Kallerka - good luck on the shower.I agree with gymmom8. I'm hoping to have a successful anniversary this weekend. That's why I didn't want to start chemo until next week. I will say that through my 2 surgeries and various appts. having something distracting was good. My next endeavor is to plan a \"memorial service\" for my breasts; the closest friends to my heart and the only part of my body that wanted to be fat! Hope to make it very entertaining and fun! After that, I'm putting together a dance benefit for the Susan G. Komen Foundation. Got lots of ideas for that. Lots of things already in the works and I WILL dance by then! Radiation won't start until after. Now I realize I'm quite new to this group but for all the mouth sore stuff, I've read that 10-15 drops of chamomile in 1/2 C warm water 3 x's a day helps. Has anyone tried it? Susie",

My onc put my case in front of tumor board and all agreed on rads for chest wall and also to take care of micriscopic cells in 1/3 lymph nodes but my PS is concerned about negative side effects for implant reconstruction. He is going to present my case in front of another tumor board. Also how did they decide on 25 treatments? They're telling me 30. I will be doing chemo but it will only be every 3 weeks for 8 reatments. My cancer is very slow growing so the chemo is considered to be of low benefit due to the oncotype test. Susie ",
