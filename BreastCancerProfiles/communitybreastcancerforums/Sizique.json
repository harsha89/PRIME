And, yes, I feel like ripping my nipple off? The itching is unbearable, even though there is no sign of shingles on that area. The blisters are mainly on my back and side, including the side of my breast. I would be interested to know if anyone has done research on mammograms and Shingles. Also, Shingles and breast cancer. This is the second time I have had Shingles. I just turned 70 and I had them when I was 16. I can't take immunizations because I have Lupus",
