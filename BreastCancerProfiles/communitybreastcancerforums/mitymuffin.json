My radiologist also said \"six months\", but I couldn't comprehend the reality of that. Hearing from you helps me be more accepting. I've managed to strain tendons in my ankles pushing myself to walk as much as I used to, when the supporting muscle wasn't there. Funny thing is that I hurt so many other places that it took a couple of months before I realized I had injured specific tendons.(They are improving.) I just don't understand the scope and compresiveness of what the chemo and radiation (not to mention the BC) has done to our bodies. But, if it works at keeping away \"the beast\" its a wonderful thing.  Ginny, my grandmother used to say something very similar. She claimed she just viewed us all as a TV show.  As they say, reality isn't all its cracked up to be. ",

Will it keep getting worse each treatment? Do you have any suggestions for getting through this? I just feel nauseated and sick, even with the nausea medicine (Zofran).  Its so hard. How did you do it? I'm on dose dense AC, followed by 12 weekly T, and I'm in the double blind Avastin trial. ",
