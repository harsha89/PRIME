You're a runner!  Running is not my favorite workout, but through the last weeks I have been adamant about keeping my exercise program a priority- it helps keep my head clear and I hope it will help with healing after surgery. Good to hear from you",

I found a small dimple just above my nipple at 11:30 before my annual mammogram was due in January. As soon as I saw it I called my PCP and asked her to change the order from a screening to a diagnostic mammogram. Strange thing was, I remembered my mother years ago mentioning she had a dimple in her breast just before she was diagnosed with BC. (she had a MX and lived many years before she passed away of an unrelated cause). The tech taped a little metal bb to the dimple and found a questionable spot. They sent me on to an US right then, and when the radiologist came in she showed me what it looked like (uneven), about an inch away from my nipple and then said they had found another smaller spot. Mine is tethered to the skin too and when I lift my breast gently from the bottom you can see about a 1\" line-sort of a crease (I'm a D cup). I went on to biopsy the next day, and it is IDC Genny, like you, I never knew I had \"dense breasts\"  and would have insisted on something more than an annual screening had I known what I know now. I've been told by 2 docs that had I not asked for a diagnostic and pointed out the dimple it would have likely been missed on the screening mammo I was scheduled for.  My MO said it's been there for awhile...as in years. Some states require that a woman be advised that her breasts are dense and might require additional imaging in the mammogram report that is mailed to her. I wish my state (Az) was one.",

Brennecke, M.D. A routine or screening mammogram consists of four views\u2014two views of each breast. The technologist takes the pictures, checks them for quality, and then you leave. With a diagnostic mammogram, you start with four standard views, and then supplement them with additional views, a physical exam, and ultrasound and MRI as needed. So a diagnostic mammogram is for women who are having a problem such as a lump or unusual nipple discharge or pain. A diagnostic mammogram is generally read by the radiologist right after it has been done; ideally the woman does not leave the radiology facility until she has an answer about what is causing her breast problem. Usually the outcome is that everything is fine, but there is a higher incidence of finding cancer in that situation than in a screening situation. ",

Somehow it means much more coming from one who has walked the path.  I have only just finished testing and received the last of the test results. After talking with the docs and doing my own research, I have decided on a MX.  As you know, there are several factors to consider when making this choice, and for me, the answer was to retain the breast. Just got my surgery date....March 10th. Now that the whirlwind of tests and meetings and decisions are made and I have my plan it is much easier, just as so many of the women here have told the newest members.  ",

Yes, I was absolutely terrified when I wrote that first post. But I have to tell you, that when you wrote at the end of your post \"You Can Do This\"  it nearly instantly empowered me. I thought, she's right, I can do this and I can do it really well, I just have to get it together and get it done a step at a time. That is not to say I haven't had meltdowns and it hasn't always been a clear path,and I have lots to get through still. But in my head during those tough times I often think of your incredibly helpful phrase. Thank you thank you thank you. I'll keep you updated on my twists and turns to come.",

I did seek another opinion, and it did help clarify my choices. I have decided to have my surgery and any subsequent treatments at Mayo. As several of you wisely suggested, I have taken my time and my head spinning slowed, which in turn allowed me to do my due diligence and the necessary research on just what all the reports mean. I asked tons of questions and the docs at Mayo have patiently answered every one of them.  I am comfortable with them and feel like I am in great hands. Az85048, thanks to you, I always have someone with me taking notes and making sure I ask the questions I have written down beforehand. PaulandSandy, I'm so sorry to hear of your mom. My mother also had BC, chose a single Mx and lived long afterwards. It seems each circumstance is different with BC and there so many things to be considered before making a decision. I am done with all the prior-to-surgery testing, and see the PS surgeon tomorrow to finalize my choice on reconstruction following the MX . I know now that I can do this and have a great medical team, family, friends and this wonderful site to shepherd me through.",

I've been lurking here since i first saw the dimple above my left nipple New Year's Day. I was due for annual screening mammogram, so I called my GP and she changed it to a diagnostic mammogram followed by ultrasound if necessary. When the radiologist said there were 2 masses ( 2.1cm and 1.1 cm ) my head started to spin and hasn't stopped. Like many of you, i want to know just what it all means and get on with treatment. I just got the preliminary path report yesterday. Low grade Invasive Ca and DCIS in the 2.1 cm tumor and a grade 1 invasive Ca in the 1.1 cm.  Seeing a surgeon and an oncologist at the Mayo Clinic next week. My doc also wants me to see the people she uses locally. (Mayo is about 35 minutes away). Have any of you had or plan to have multiple opinions and if you did, was it helpful?   Dx 1/8/2014, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIB, Grade 1, 2/16 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Hormonal Therapy 1/16/2014 Arimidex (anastrozole) Log in to post a reply",
