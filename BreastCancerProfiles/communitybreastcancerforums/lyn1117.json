They indicate now I must do Chemo and then Herceptin, but no further surgery...  Any clarity from you wonderful people would be helpful and I really appreciate accessing this site and the posts it has kept me sane so far...but I feel like I am slipping as each visit to the Onc has more bad news.   thank you so!  lyn Dx IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

My sincere apologies for laying this on this board, but it feels good to let it out.  Please understand, I have many people depending on me and now as I took this overseas assignment, I have no life insurance either!!  I am distressed and starting chemo next week.  Dont know how long I can maintain this charade.  Again, apologies, bless you for the fights you are in and the fights you have made.  One cannot understand without having the same situation facing them...I know this is why I have issues at work...  Take care and again, thanks for listening.",

Bette, good luck to you on shrinking the lump. I wish I had your skills with German!    Julie, Good to hear it is offered in the US, but I was told it is only offered in clinical trials as well as only for those people who had certain other qualifications, i.e. postmenopausal (which I am not).  Best to both of you and keep in touch!!!  lyn",
