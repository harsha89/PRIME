She is still doing fine, did chemio, radio, zometa, and MRI checks every two months. Hopefully she will live many more years with the desease. The mets sometimes appear larger/more of them in the MRI, but the doctors told her to hang in there, that she could go on with this \"chronic\" desease. There is hope!  It is very very hard to confort a sister that is so sick so far away, hope is the best you can share with her.  I send you my love and prayers!",
