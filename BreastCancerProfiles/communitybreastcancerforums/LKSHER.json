My family and some friends think I am a little too sensitive about all of this and I get reminded all the time that \"everyone means well\".  Yeah, okay....I know that, but come on!   A friend suggested a T-shirt that reads, \"Stay Tuned\" to wear until my exchange for the chest glancers.  That made me laugh. Then after, I could wear one that says, \"So, waddya think?\"",

      "Content": "Jan 23, 2014 06:38AM - edited Jan 23, 2014 06:42AM by LKSHER I understand. I can see the 'Oh, there she is (with the pouty face or the way too eager breathing hard look people get) from a mile away.  It means someone is about to make a bee-line toward me (and usually one or both of my kids) to tell me they are praying for me and ask me how I am feeeeeeling, or talk about my freaking hair.  I absolutely hate it.  I wish I could erase everyone's memory including my own.  I wish everyone would just treat me like me.  When they say they are praying for me, it makes me feel like they think I am going to die and it reminds me of EVERYTHING I am afraid of and EVERYTHING I have been through.  Then, they always glance at my chest.  It breaks my heart.  I am waiting for my exchange in late March and my expanders are way far apart and look weird.  I wear a scarf everyday.  I guess that's one reason to be thankful for the cold. I did extensive and aggressive treatment that ended with an oopherectomy in October, but I finished treatment in September.  Why are they still praying?  Why is this still all people associate with me?  I think most uninformed people believe that because I was \"stage 3\", that it's just a short matter of time before I die, so I get that whole pity thing with the 'wow you look amazing for a dying person attitude and the you are so strong to smile even though you know you're going to die' twist. I want to scream \"LEAVE ME AND MY CHILDREN ALONE AND GO AWAY!!!\" (using stronger language), but I am almost always gracious and smiley.  I do say quickly that I am fine and have been fine the whole time and then I keep the subject changed. I think about moving because I know everyone in our city.  I consider hypnosis to make me feel better about this. It's so strange because I wish my husband would be much MORE sweet, loving, protective, and nurturing but I wish everyone else would shut the hell up and forget about this. Counseling is not helping me with these feelings.   It's nice to not feel all alone when I see I am not the only one annoyed with those who just don't get it.",

      "Content": "LKSHER wrote: I was diagnosed with IDC on Feb 6th. I have followed a lump in my breast since puberty always the size of a golfball and it changed with my cycles. For years I was told it was fibrocystic. It felt different to me in 2009 and I had it biopsied via US. Since microcalcifications were found in my other breast that was biopsied, too (awful stereotactic experience). Everything came back reported as b9. In June of 2012, I had a strange rash mostly on my left breast and it was itchy and my nipples looked very irritated. I went to the doctor and they weren't sure what it was so I was sent for bilateral US and mammogram. The rash ended up going away soon after and they didn't biopsy anything but said all looked as if it hadn't changed since 2009. In the Fall of 2012, I noticed this lump I have always had seemed bigger and harder, I waited a while to see if it was too much coffee or whatever....based on my multiple procedures with benign results in the past (not just the breast ones I have mentioned). In January, my OB/Gyn measured it and we waited 2 wks and measured it again. At that time, she sent me for a Mammo/US again. This time everyone seemed concerned and gave it a Birads 5. It was biopsied and although they found a lot of benign stuff and sclerosing adenoma, they found IDC and LCIS. My big lump, that I have always had measures around 5cm now. I got mammo on the other side and guess what? They found clusters of microcalcs and they were worried. At this point I changed to the best care in my region and had more biopsies done and rechecked the path. So, I have IDC in both breasts, my FNB on left nodes came back positive and the Pet Scan showed the cancer in the left breast and the nodes, but the right breast didn't even light up. They seem so happy the rest of scan was clear, but if it didn't even show the cancer in the right (which is small), how do they know it's clear. They don't. I am 39 and have a husband and 2 beautiful active children ages almost 14 and almost 11. We are extremely close and I gave up teaching to be there for them in every way and support their goals and dreams. They are saying Stage 3 because of size and node involvement. It is grade 1 and highly ER/PR + Not HERS. They are scheduling me for a bilateral mastectomy first, then dense dose chemo, and radiation to follow with nodes out on left and sentinel test on right. Then hormone suppression indefinitely. I know everyone says to be positive and the docs say they are going for curing it, but I am so terrified and worry that I will do all this invasive painful treatment just to leave my family anyway.

I am doing mildly better. Tentative surgery date set for March 12. Although they may move it up. I went to a psychiatrist today who was also dx as Stage 3 a few years ago and is doing great. I am thinking of starting melatonin at night and changing from the little bit of Xanax I have been taking to a bit of vistaril. My husband says I have gotten bossy again, so I must be feeling a bit better. I feel more angry and witchy and blatantly honest (like i say whatever comes to mind) in the last couple days instead of just plain defeated and sad. I have many moments of hopeless thoughts, but they aren't my only thoughts like they were a few days ago. I just wanted to check in and I hope everyone is doing well!",

I already know that there is cancer in both breasts and I knew I had a node positive on left side, but this makes the node situation sound pretty bad. It said 25mm metabolically active in left breast and at least one node was pretty big as well, according to other reports and tests. Every time I start to feel a little hopeful, I see something like this. I just keep rereading the multiple node success stories. Being a grade 1, pretty sure all of this has been cooking for quite some time. What if I have positive nodes on the right, too? What am I supposed to answer when people ask me how I am? Metabolically active left breast mass with multiple metabolically active left axillary lymph nodes consistent with adenopathy. Calcifications are noted within the right breast, without evidence for increased metabolic activity. Some breast tumors exhibit very low FDG uptake, hence, continued followup with mammography recommended.",

Not to mention talking about me like I wasn't even here anymore. I cried all day. They were all being asked to chip in for a new vacuum (my husband had mentioned in passing that ours had broken). The whole thing was just awkward, upsetting, and in poor taste. My friend set it all straight and then someone replied to defend the first email. It was just so insensitive.

For years I was told it was fibrocystic. It felt different to me in 2009 and I had it biopsied via US. Since microcalcifications were found in my other breast that was biopsied, too (awful stereotactic experience). Everything came back reported as b9. In June of 2012, I had a strange rash mostly on my left breast and it was itchy and my nipples looked very irritated. I went to the doctor and they weren't sure what it was so I was sent for bilateral US and mammogram. The rash ended up going away soon after and they didn't biopsy anything but said all looked as if it hadn't changed since 2009. In the Fall of 2012, I noticed this lump I have always had seemed bigger and harder, I waited a while to see if it was too much coffee or whatever....based on my multiple procedures with benign results in the past (not just the breast ones I have mentioned). In January, my OB/Gyn measured it and we waited 2 wks and measured it again. At that time, she sent me for a Mammo/US again. This time everyone seemed concerned and gave it a Birads 5. It was biopsied and although they found a lot of benign stuff and sclerosing adenoma, they found IDC and LCIS. My big lump, that I have always had measures around 5cm now. I got mammo on the other side and guess what? They found clusters of microcalcs and they were worried. At this point I changed to the best care in my region and had more biopsies done and rechecked the path. So, I have IDC in both breasts, my FNB on left nodes came back positive and the Pet Scan showed the cancer in the left breast and the nodes, but the right breast didn't even light up. They seem so happy the rest of scan was clear, but if it didn't even show the cancer in the right (which is small), how do they know it's clear. They don't. I am 39 and have a husband and 2 beautiful active children ages almost 14 and almost 11. We are extremely close and I gave up teaching to be there for them in every way and support their goals and dreams. They are saying Stage 3 because of size and node involvement. It is grade 1 and highly ER/PR + Not HERS. They are scheduling me for a bilateral mastectomy first, then dense dose chemo, and radiation to follow with nodes out on left and sentinel test on right. Then hormone suppression indefinitely. I know everyone says to be positive and the docs say they are going for curing it, but I am so terrified and worry that I will do all this invasive painful treatment just to leave my family anyway.

This was my reply: I am not one of those pink stage 0 or 1 people who are excited about new boobs and stuff. I may not survive this very long and in the meantime I will be going through painful treatments that will ruin my body and the rest of my health. I will be missing valuable time with my children and then there are still definitely not any guarantees, so I don't feel positive as much as so many people keep trying to shove down my throat and that's why I haven't been talking to anyone. I just can't deal with any of this. I was already depressed. Now I am just below bottom and I have no idea how I will ever get through this and that's the truth. I will be old, ugly, and ruined and probably die in next few years anyway. That's not what anyone wants to hear and I don't want any stupid pep talks or to see anyone else's emotions or hear how I need to change my attitude and be strong. That is why I am avoiding everyone. I know I will need help. I get it. I just have no idea how to accept it and how to act \"positive\". I am obviously in a very bad place and my husband has lost patience with my \"negative\" attitude. My team wants me to wait for any kind of reconstruction until after I finish all treatment including radiation and that makes me feel awful. I am a young and pretty woman with long hair and I had nice natural boobs. Do I care as much about cosmetics as living? No. But, I do care. I would be lying if I said I didn't. My chances of recurrance seem high due to tumor size (even though I bet a lot of it is benign tissue) and node involvement and cancer on both sides. I feel hopeless and angry and it I feel like I now have to pretend that I feel strong and positive or everyone will be mad and disappointed in me. I even went to the stage 4 boards because someone said there aren't many grade 1 ladies there. Well, I saw them there. I care for everyone here and I know this is not all about me, but I am struggling so much. I did take a xanax last night even though I hate to and I am going to talk to a counselor very soon. Still don't see how it will help me. I am a young, strong, beautiful woman and I just want to stay that way and be a mom and have fun and live without worry. I am so down today.....and everyday. So dreading everything. I am sure no one wants to hear any of this stuff, but I obviously need some help. :(",

I am doing mildly better. Tentative surgery date set for March 12. Although they may move it up. I went to a psychiatrist today who was also dx as Stage 3 a few years ago and is doing great. I am thinking of starting melatonin at night and changing from the little bit of Xanax I have been taking to a bit of vistaril. My husband says I have gotten bossy again, so I must be feeling a bit better. I feel more angry and witchy and blatantly honest (like i say whatever comes to mind) in the last couple days instead of just plain defeated and sad. I have many moments of hopeless thoughts, but they aren't my only thoughts like they were a few days ago. I just wanted to check in and I hope everyone is doing well!",

In the meantime, my onc (and I agree) believes shutting down estrogen is the key for me. I am aware that chemo often puts you in menopause at least temporarily. I am 39, have one ovary, get a short period every 23/24 days after having a uterine ablation a few years ago due to sudden excessive bleeding from fibroids (gyn assumed). I lost my other ovary and fallopian tube due to a 5cm endometrioma around the same time I had my ablation. I currently have another complex cyst that has the classic endometrioma look on my remaining ovary. It's been there for almost 2 yrs. It did not light up on my PetScan and has been tracked closely for 2 yrs. Ironically, I didn't have the cyst out b/c I was afraid of early and sudden menopause. My gut tells me that although I know estrogen comes from my ovary and I have always been a hormonal girl, that much of my estrogen that has caused this is the result of my adrenal gland and constant stress and panic attacks for a number of years. Thank you for reading and my actual question is, so you think Lupron with this chemo regimen is going to be too much all at once and put my SE's off the charts. I start chemo on April 11th and I think my onc also wants to give me lupron that day. She says if it were her, that is what she would do. Everyone agrees that chemo will not be my most effective tool, but that hormone suppression will be....which is making it difficult for me to feel empowered by doing the chemo. Very interested in knowledge and thoughts from wise and experienced women. Please nothing scary or upsetting right now. I just can't handle it. I felt so confident today leaving my multiple appointments until a young girl in a wheelchair stopped me and asked me if I had been recently diagnosed (she recognized the bag we had with new patient stuff). I reluctantly said yes (very fragile these days) and she proceeded to tell me she had finished treatment and found out just after that she had mets all over and was exploring alternative treatments. She wanted to stay in touch and tell me about them. I felt for her, and I am certainly not against using alternative methods in conjunction with my treatment plan, but her approach and timing left me in panicked tears and instantly took away the comfort and confidence I felt just moments before. Sigh....needed to get all that out. Thanks again everyone.",

It was very rough for me Tuesday and Wednesday...emotionally and physically painful. I feel soooo much better today (Thursday)....although still struggling on a smaller more tolerable scale. I was on a fentanyl button until late yesterday when they finally were able to switch me to Percocet, which is managing my pain much better (or it just it better) but it makes me itchy all over (a common side effect). I probably had 20 panic attacks while I was in the hospital. They are in part due to the meds I am not used to at all. The month leading up to this was horrible. I am glad to feel that the sickness has been removed and now I will do the additional insurance and do my very best to live my life to the fullest and stay healthy and enjoy my family and my life.

I just found out about the pathology and although, I am not surprised, I am feeling very down and scared again. So afraid for my kids who were upset all week to stay with friends and missed me so much. I have no idea what to do to feel less bleak right now.",

Bilateral mx with lymph node removal on left, sentinel node on the right (at least) and possible TE, plus a port placement.....seems like too much at once. Very afraid of the pain and nausea....and also the lymphedema thing has me so upset on top of everything else. I just had a nice night away with my husband, but now I am feeling so blue and terrified again. I am glad for those of you who are out of surgery and feeling less pain now.",
