I have very large breast and have had 2 intraductal papiloma removed and going for a 3rd this month, so far I have been lucky they have all been Benign.  I am considering having Preventive Mastectomy and Reconstruction with tissue flaps. I have seen a Surgeon and he explain the procedure, of removing my breast and doing a tummy tuckm then using skin, fatty tissue and musle to form new breast. I understand this is a long surgery (about 10 hours ) and he says that I would be in the hospital 3-4 days then home recovering, and that I can drive in 1 week and back to work in 2-3 weeks.........  I would love to talk to someone who has had this surgery and could tell me about their recovery. I am 65 years old, live alone and I am a self-employed bookkeeper, working from home and is client offices.............. I can't afford to be out of work very long . Hope to hear from some one !

( fat they couldn't remove at time of surgery, because they would have had cut into my back and then I would have been even more uncomfortable. I sleep on my back with pillows at my side to elevate my arms so the don't rub on the dog ears. I understand your pain........... I feel like I have a tight rubber band across my chest and it gets tighter my the end of the day....... Physical therapy was just suggested to me and I have an appt. with Dr. to check incision, then they will schedule therapy......... I hope !    Has anyone else heard of Dog Ears !! Hope you are feeling better! ",

I wish you luck and keep fighting........ if you had breast cancer the insurance would have to cover re-construction ( implants ) so they should cover the dog-ears !",
