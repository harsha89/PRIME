Anyway, if you are limited in who you can share this with in your personal life finding a support group might be a good substitute.",

I tried Marinol on top of the steroid and aloxi but it made me literally feel crazy. So added zofran and phenegran instead. Also took 1/2 an ativan on the really bad days. That worked OK but I've barely been able to eat until today. Probably lost 5 pounds. I can barely remember the last few days I've been so out of it.

No matter how hard this is for her now I bet that a few years from she will look back on how much she learned about courage and strength from you during this time. I'm sure even if she's not talking much she is watching you carefully and taking it all in. It must be very scary for a kid that age to have a sick parent. Anyway, I hope she is doing OK.

Remember that in addition to all of the other side effects chemo does a number on your hormones which really effect your emotional reaction. Sometimes it's just all that chemical craziness going on inside that can make you feel depressed, upset, or like you just can't handle it. Don't let that get you down. I spent hours crying last week for no reason. I swear it was hormones. Chemo has been a lot like pregnancy for me with the nausea, fatigue and crazy mood swings. Hang in there.

I'm hoping if we put all of our chemo brains together we can come up with something cool (but simple). Any ideas?",

Anyway, I drink 1-2 bottles of water before I go in, ask the nurse for 2-3 of those instant warming bags and wrap those all around my hand/wrist for several minutes and then let them start looking for a vein. The combination of being very well hydrated plus having WARM hands seems to make a huge difference.",

Or, they will give her 10 days of chemo and see if she responds to it. IF she responds to the chemo (and it seems uncertain that she will) she has a 50% chance of going into remission.

I am going wig shopping tomorrow morning with my husband and have an appointment with my favorite hair dresser Thursday afternoon to get my hair and wig cut. Between all of that and trying to work at least the week is going by quickly. I am incredibly nervous about that first treatment. I seem to have lost my insomnia (after 2 months) only to have it replaced with this feeling of total panic when I wake up in the morning. I think I'll feel better once I pass the point of no return and have the chemo on Friday.",

Her2 + means that the bc cells in your body are overexpressing a certain receptor. It also means that the drug Herceptin will work to help you. Take a look at this info: www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/...Â  I know several women who have taken Herceptin - most of them have had few or no side effects from it. You can post a question about Her2 in the chemotherapy section of this board - I bet you'll get lots and lots of first hand responses. There are a lot of scary things about chemo. I didn't know how sick I would feel, would I be able to take care of my kids, would I be able to keep working, how would I deal with being bald, etc., etc. Chemo for me was much worse than surgery because I could hide the surgery - but once my hair fell out I looked sick. I couldn't pretend that I was OK. But, with that said - chemo was no where near as horrible as I thought it would be. I got through it, lots of women have, and you can too. It sucks, but you can handle it. The anti-nausea drugs they have now are incredible. I felt crappy during chemo, but I never threw up. Every step of the way so far my anticipation of treatment has always been worse than actually going through it. Hang in there. It will get better. It's OK to be afraid. Â Â ",

I hope all of you find just as much support and encouragement in this group. Last Janauary I started 6 rounds of FEC after having 2 surgeries. I'm sitting here tonight with hair, eyebrows, a normal energy level and feeling great. Best wishes to all of you!Â ",
