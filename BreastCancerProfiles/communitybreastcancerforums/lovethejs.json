I'm trying to process all this and thought I'd jump in here because I know that I need support from other persons going through similar things. I went to a surgeon because my mamo showed calcifications and the surgeon found a thickening and sent me for an ultrasound. I had a core biopsy and it came back as ILC. I still have to have the biopsy done on the calcifications and an MRI on both breasts. After all this is done the doctor said we will sit down and decide what to do next. Log in to post a reply",

My head is just so confused and overwhelmed with everything. It's only been a week and yesterday when the breast center called to schedule my appointment for the biobsy on the calcifications and the MRI I just lost it. Which took me by surprise. I have four children two who are still at home one who has a disability. I am trying to keep it together but need to express my feelings. How can I deal with my sons with out scaring them and still deal with myself. It seems I have to learn another juggling act. Does anyone have any tips. I will continue to read and learn from all of you.  Thank you so much for being here. Marge",
