I had my first treatment of Taxotere/Cytoxen 7 days ago with the Neulasta shot the next day. About 3 or 4 days ago I noticed a small rash, it now looks like I walked by a blow torch. It is all over my back, my groin area, my rear end and in the crack!! I...AM...IN...HELL... I have tried everything! Cortisone topical, even special spray for chemo to relieve irritated skin, anything I could find. I take Claritin every day, and don't want to take Benadryl during the day because I don't want to be laid out in bed sleeping. I just took two Benadryl tonight and a Tagament. I should have thought about adding the Tagament! It is actually a therapy for dogs with mast cell tumor in conjunction with the benadryl. I am going to pray I can sleep tonight. I am so tired of itching, rubbing my back on any doorway I can find before I lose my mind. People probably think I have already. I have never ever had itching like this before in my life, and I have lived with severe allergies since I was a child. I am beginning to wonder if it is worth going through this chemo. I am triple negative, 2.2 cm tumor removed by double mastectomy, clean margins, node negative. There is no way in hell I can go through 15 more weeks of this. I cannot live on steroids either, I have already gained 10 lbs from this. I am a hair away from saying screw it but I will call my ONC tomorrow and see if he has a plan to get rid of this. I am so glad I am not alone!!!! Thank each and every one of you for posting your story!",
