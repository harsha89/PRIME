      "Content": "mbbb wrote: My sister had her surgery recently, and the affected breast and all the adjacent armpit lymph nodes were removed (She doesn't live in the US) Subsequent tests showed that one of the lymph nodes had \"cancer\" too. We are not sure if it was microscopic or not, but the ultrasound prior to the surgery found no problems in the lymph nodes. It's my understanding that arm pain is quite common after the surgery. However, she also had it for several months before the surgery. My question is: is this a likely sign of bone metastasis, or is it sufficiently explained by the lymph node involvement? The right thing to do is to talk to the doctor about that, of course, but I don't want to spook her by suggesting the possibility of bone metastases, especially if there is no reason to think that.
