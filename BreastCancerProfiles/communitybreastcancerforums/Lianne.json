I would strongly suggest meet with a Genetic Councellor in your area to go over your options. I tested, and I am a carrier of the BRCA2 mutation.  I chose to have a preventitive bilateral mastectomy in January this year.  I have kept a journal of my experience. If you are interested here is the link.  lianne-brca2.livejournal.com Please feel free to share it with anyone you feel may benefit as well. Wishing you well, ~Lianne",

I know that breast cancer is very rare in someone as young as yourself.  Please go see your doctor... Come back and let us know how things go!",
