      "Content": "journeydbd wrote: About 3 weeks ago I found a hard lump under my left armpit. I gave it a week and then saw the dr. She gave me a 10 day stint of antibiotics. She said to come back in 2 weeks for an ultrasound if not gone. Well, it's been 2 weeks and the lump is still there. It is much smaller now- it was quarter size, now pea size. I have a 2nd lump now, however its different though. The first is hard and solid. This second lump is more of a swelling. I have a connective tissue disease so I am always sick. My Dr tends to brush me off because I have such generalized symptoms daily. She did take my lump serious but that was because it was hard and large. I am worried she will not think anything of the second swollen place. I know my body though and it's not normal. I am a 30 yr old female. I have had nipple discharge in both breast since I was 26. I have no children. About two years ago I found large lumps in my left breast. They did a mammogram and u/s but basically said my breast were too dense. They didn't see anything serious though. My left breast is much larger than my right, by a lot! So, that is my history--do I go to the follow up? I have just learned that if I go to the dr too soon they stop helping me. I live in a small town where 30 yr olds do not get breast cancer, and that's how the Dr's treat me. I would appreciate any guidance. Log in to post a reply",
