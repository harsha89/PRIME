It has been 20 months since my intial diagnosis of ILC stage IIa, lumpectomy, TC x4 and rads. The chemo put me into menopause after the first TX. I started spotting with some slight bleeding yesterday, along with some pain in my lower left side and just wanted to know if this is normal or if it has happened to anyone else? I still have those nagging thoughts that everything could be cancer coming back. I do take Tamoxifen. I see my Onc again next month but would like more info from you ladies to educate me prior to my visit. Thank you very much!

I have read other post on here about cold caps and preventing hair loss. Do you know anything about this topic? Also, how long does it take before your hair begins to start falling out? This maybe a silly question but does it start to grow prior to each treatment and then fall out again? Thanks! ",

The good thing about the test is if there are any polyp's, the doctor will remove them during the test and send them out to be tested. Both times I went I had 2-3 removed each time and they were benign. The doctor even told me that they didnt look suspicious when he was finished. Good luck with your testand try not to worry! :)",
