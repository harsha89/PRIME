It's weird just waiting to see what is going to happen to me with all of this junk in my body! It is Friday and it seems I wake up a lot of energy, then need a nap and in the evening experience flu-like sypmptoms which are tolerable. The nausea meds are wonderful! A Bendadryl before bed helped with waking up a lot at night although I still woke up super early. Still praying about whether to go back to work next week. I teach art to little kids (lot's of germs) and have read all of the pros and cons. Waiting on God to show me what the next step is to be!! Thanks for starting this thread!",

I had my second chemo on Monday and am just sitting here waiting for it to happen! I don't want to leave the house for fear of clumps of hair falling out! I am on Taxol so I know it supposed to happen right about now. I have had fun shopping with my daughter and friends for scarfs and hats and a wig which made it a little better. Praying for you today that you will embrace every step with courage:D",
