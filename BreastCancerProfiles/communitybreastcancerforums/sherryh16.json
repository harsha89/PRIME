My hair did not come back as it was prior to chemo. It is extremely thin, dry, and I have bald areas at crown. The pharma company knew this was a possiblitity and it was labeled as such in Europe, but not here in US. There are now numerous lawsuits pending and it may become a class action suit. The pharma company knew this side effect and yet withheld this knowledge from us here in the US. We had no option to make an informed choice as to our treatment. Taxol, a similar product, provides the same cancer killing effect without the permanent hairloss. I know that had I known the diffference in chemo treatment available to me, I would never have taken the chance with Taxotere and not having my hair return. I am coming up on 5 years and I still feel right in the thick of treatment every time I look at my head. I cannot participate in normal life activities due to embarrassment of no hair. I never leave the house without my wig. I hate it. I feel the company that made this product and did not inform us of the very possible outcome of having no hair regrowth should be held accountable. I am pursing a lawsuit. I want to be compensated for the ongoing expense of rogaine, wigs, and the endless changes to my daily life due to my bald condition. I have been wronged and they need to pay. Do some research ladies. Google Taxotere lawsuit.",

Since my head was shaved after 2nd chemo treatment, I have been using rogaine daily. I've also over this last year been using a laser light cap. (personally I don't think its done a damn thing). I've taken biotin the entire 5 years. And, recently I've been adding a castor oil conditioning treatment daily to my head -- I say head because there is not much hair along the crown to put it on, but I do apply and rub about my scalp with hopes it will lead to hair grow and at least thicken and strenthen the hair that is there. I began by wearing wigs at first, and then I went to hair pieces, hair toppers to cover my thin hair, exposed scalp. I have ordered from vogue.com and from uniwig.com. They both offer synthetic and human hair pieces. I have found uniwig human hair toppers to be cheaper and their topper pieces look more like my pre-chemo hair. Wig or topper piece, they are hot and during summer months I am dripping with sweat. Uncomfortable and disgusting not to mention the costs involved -- none of which is covered by insurance. I have recently order a synthetic hair topper from vogue wigs and hope to receive it soon. It is shorter in length than the pieces I've order from uniwig, but I am optimistic I will be able to blend it into my own hair which grows pretty good around the nap of my head. Time will tell.. As with many of you I am pissed my hair never grew back. It has led me to change my life in that I don't go out without a hair piece, not even to get the mail or take out the garbage. I no longer swim (which I miss doing with the granddaughter), among numerous other things. It is a very real difference in how and what I can no longer do. BUT -- AND THIS IS THE BIG BUT, I am alive! I know this and I will go on. I am adjusting to this new normal even if it is not what I would have believed would occur. I am not just a survivor, I am a thriver!",
