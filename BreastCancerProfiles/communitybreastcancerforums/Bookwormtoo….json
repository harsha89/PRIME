I had a clear mammo but a few weeks ago after my regular appointment, my onc recommended an mri since my cancer ( two years ago) was stage 1 lobular. My insurance gave me a tough time but eventually i had the mri. Last week I got the call that the  mri showed two tiny questionable areas. I am scheduled for an ultrasound on Thursday and trying hard not to panic. Doesn't the mri usually come after the ultrasound? I am wondering now whether she saw something on the physical exam during the regular office visit. Waiting sucks!",

Onc seems confident that I shouldn't worry since there are lots of other possible reasons for the suspicious areas. I will have to wait for the appointment then a couple of days for the results. I am not in a panic but I just wish it was done. ",
