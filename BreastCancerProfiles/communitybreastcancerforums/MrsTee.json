I know I will make the best decision for me...just wanted to know what others did - I was kind of thinking that I was being a bit extreme - I know everyones case is different - I had my best friend and God mother both pass from breast cancer and both had only one breast removed - which adds to my stress level. So the surgery wasn't as bad as you thought? I'm dreading the pain!",

I went to Johns Hopkins today (about 4 hrs away) to get an second opinion...I guess holding out thinking that maybe a mastectomy was not the only option...so much for that...that surgeon agreed with my current surgeons plan...so Jan 28th will be my surgery date. Still making a decision as to what to do with the other breast...I'm still waiting for the results from my BRAC test - I hope it will be back before then. I really appreciate all you ladies as I don't know anyone that is dealing with this and those around do not understand (not from a lack of trying)....",

I've read about so many others journeys and it really helped. I had some issues on my right side some years back so that kind of help me make the decision too. I'm SO nervous but I know in the end it will be alright. Went to meet with my PS again today because I had some last minute questions so it helped with some of the questions that I know he answered but I totally didn't hear. How did the exchange go for you? Glad that you are doing so well!! Glad that I found this site!",
