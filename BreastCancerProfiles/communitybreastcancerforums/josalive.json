I was diagnosed with stage 4 from the get go with one solitary liver met that was 2.5 cm. After chemo it has now shrunk down to less than 1cm but now I am considering local treatment to get rid of it. My dr. Referred me to a dr. Who does Cyberknife and a liver surgeon who is suggesting RFA. I can't really decide which one is the better option. I'm sort of leaning toward the RFA to avoid radiation and the Dr. Will also be able to scan the rest of my liver while he is doing it to make sure there aren't any other problem spots. But the SBRT with Cyberknife seems like a really advanced technology that has great success rates as well. Does anyone have experience with either and do you have any thoughts? It's so nice to be able to converse with people who have past experience with this. I thank you so much for any advice you can provide.",

I think I'm just about 3 months ahead of you as I was recently diagnosed stage IV with one met to my liver and am her2+. I am now through my 4th cycle of Taxotere, Carboplatin, Herceptin and Perjeta that I do every three weeks. I will be getting my first scan since I started chemo next week to see how it's working. If my cancer is responding nicely I will drop the chemo at 6 treatments and continue on with herceptin and perjeta. I can no longer feel any sign of cancer in my breast so my fingers are crossed that it is working well. If not, I'm not sure how much of that treatment I will be able to handle as it's starting to really wear on me. The worst side effects I've had is fatigue and low blood cell counts. Days 3-9 are the worst and then you rebound. To be honest, it's been easier than I thought it would be and it has gone by quicker than I thought as well. So good luck to you and I'd definitely suggest going to Sloan Kettering when you're in NY. I'm getting ready to head out to MD Anderson to get advice on surgery and liver treatment options. If you're like me, you'll have about a 10 day window between treatments that you'll be feeling well enough to travel. Good luck with everything and feel free to PM me if you have an questions!",

When my onc called he told me the median overall survival was 14-16 months. I am 35 and have very young children. The diagnosis was crushing at first but all of you are showing that there is certainly life much longer than 14-16 months after a diagnosis like this. I was wondering if anyone had a similar diagnosis (stage IV from the beginning and not recurrent with liver met) and if your onc suggested anything other than just the chemo and targeted systemic therapy? Like radiation or surgery for the met spot or anything else? My onc is saying that he doesn't recommend it because it doesn't do anything to prolong my life. I was thinking of asking for a referral to see a radiologist anyway. I just started chemo and herceptin and perjeta on March 12 and can no longer feel the lump that was distinguishable just a week ago. I'm hoping it has the same effect on my liver. I'm just at a point where I want to make sure I'm doing everything I can from the beginning to fight this cancer. I have tried calling for second opinion Dr. appointments this week but nobody will see me since I've already started treatment with another doctor. They said they would be able to talk to me after I finish the chemotherapy. Any thoughts you may have would be extremely appreciated. Best wishes to you all.",

I was diagnosed about 3 weeks ago and have been on an emotional roller coaster. Some days I feel like I can handle this and am ready for the fight and the next minute I am crying uncontrollably. I keep trying to look to my Faith and trust in my doctors but I keep getting pulled into a dark hole when I'm least expecting it. My son who is only 2 is having a hard time when I leave in the morning and doesn't want to leave the house. I feel like my emotions are putting my family and friends through an even harder time and I need to pull it together but I just can't seem to get in a stable place. The Ativan definitely helps but I am also afraid of the heavy narcotics. I don't need an addiction to fight on top of an advanced cancer diagnosis. I was thinking of trying to talk to a therapist but that's also another expense on top of the expensive cancer. I'm hoping it gets better with time but knowing what we have ahead... I'm not so sure it will. I'm starting to think this Stage IV cancer is more of a mental battle than it even is a physical one. The thing that has been helping the most is to know that treatment is good and getting better and we never know how long we have so keeping a positive attitude and enjoying every day is what we have to do. Good luck to you.",

Now waiting to see if I have brain mets which is the scariest wait I've had yet. Of course, I google 'brain metastases' and find that it is most common in women under 50 who are her2+/er- and who have had metastases to visceral organs (my exact case). Sometimes I need to stay off the internet :( Does anyone else try to read the technicians reactions after the scan? My technician was so bubbly and nice when I got there and barely said two words to me when I was leaving. I'm probably just paranoid. I still haven't figured out how I get the results of these tests. They don't show up in my patient portal. I guess I'll wait for my doctor to call and then ask her about that. I'm always so encouraged by your stories even if you did encounter progression or bad results because you are all so strong and seem to keep pretty positive. Good luck on all upcoming results!",
