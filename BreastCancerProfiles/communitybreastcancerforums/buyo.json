      "Content": "buyo wrote: How long does chemo brain last? I had it real bad during dose dense AC. It was a little better during T. My last chemo was 5/6/10. I feel much more clear headed, but my brain still does not work right! There will be times when I'm talking, and the wrong words come out of my mouth. Sometimes I can't even think of the word I want. I'm extremely forgetful and easily distracted. I'm begining to think chemo has caused permenant brain damage (or that I might have a brain tumor)! Has anyone else have this problem for this long, or am I the only one?

I'm so worried I have a serious problem that I've scheduled an appointment with my onc (I'm only supposed to see him every 6 months). His nurse said I shouldn't be having these extreme symptoms four months out. I'm afraid I have a brain tumor, as my cancer was triple negative. It's so frustrating and embarrassing!",
