Today I had another ultrasound on the mass, and had scheduled a biopsy, but when they did the measurments they noticed that it had gotten smaller, and changed it's location. So based on the smaller measurments the radiologist said it has to be benign! Yay! I have a follow up appointment in 6 months for another ultrasound, just to monitor it. On another note both girls ended up coming home on labor day. Its been great having them home, just a little exhausting. Here is a picture of them from last night.... On the left is Autumn, and the right is Isabella. They will be 8 weeks old on Monday, but were born 9 weeks early. Well thanks to everyone for all your support, it helps talking to others who have been in your situation or similar. Now I just have to be careful when I get older because of my strong family history. Thanks again, ~MalindaÂ ",
