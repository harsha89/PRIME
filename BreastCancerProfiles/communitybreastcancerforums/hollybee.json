Have been going round and round for 2 months with the therapist/medical supplies dept at our clinic trying to get me a final fit in a sleeve and glove, and we just now got it right! So I haven't even been in a day sleeve for the past 2 months, which tells me that it might not be that critical to wear one - very gratifying. Will keep a close eye on that arm, however. I am so very happy I don't have to spend hours and hours on this business! Hope it stays that way! Log in to post a reply",

Can't give you any advice on your proposed surgery, I don't know about that. I love your sweet puppy picture! Holly",

I let them soak in dish detergent and hung them up to dry, but they still don't look terribly clean. Also very wrinkled and I tried ironing them, which helped, but I don't know whether I should be doing that. They are easier to wrap when not wrinkled, for sure. I'm sure you guys are way ahead of me on this. What is the best way to wash so they get clean, and to smooth out? Also, as an aside, how often do you need to buy new ones? And how often do you need to buy the white cottony fluffy stuff you wrap underneath? Thanks again Holly Log in to post a reply",

Hope this helps.  This happened to me in 2005, and I had a mastectomy because the cancer was fairly large, plus the surgeon recommended doing the other breast too because this kind tends more to come back in the other breast.  Am happy with that decision and doing very well since then, by the way.  Lymph nodes were clear too.  YESSS!!!",

I forgot to mention that my biopsy wasn't the usual needle biopsy type of thing where they aim it at the lump.  Mine was an excisional biopsy, meaning he took a chunk of tissue out to see what was in it.  If that matters.  Hoping the best for you.  keep us posted.",
