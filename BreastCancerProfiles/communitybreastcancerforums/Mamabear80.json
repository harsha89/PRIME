My dad was diagnosed and had a mastectomy 5 years ago. Four of his five sisters were also diagnosed, with one aunt passing away at the age of 35. Our family tested negative for BRCA genes..go figure... Beachmama- Seems like we have a lot in common. I also had BMX on August 8th. Path report showed positive margin. Just had a second surgery yesterday (9/12) to attempt to remove the stubborn tissue. Hoping to hear results by Friday. If margins are clear, I'll be able to avoid radiation. My MO was adamant initially about Tamoxifen, but seemed to backtrack during my last visit. Said it would only increase survival by 1%? From what I've read, I feel like it would be irresponsible not to try it. I see her next week and will hope for more guidance. Good luck to everyone, and praying for speedy recoveries.",
