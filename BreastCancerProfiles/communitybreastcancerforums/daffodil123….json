Does extreme dense tissue increase the possibility of cancer? Â If it is cancer, will it be in very early stage can be cured by surgery only without any medication and radiation? I have kidney failure and I just started Peritoneal Dialysis. They asked me to get mammogram before they consider me for kidney transplant. Now calcifications are another thing I have to worry about. I will get it biopsied next week but I just want to have some piece of mind.",

Left breast is completely clear. There is no lump or anything else. Dealing with two problems at the same time is very difficult.",

It appears that the calcifications located the 12:00' 4 cm from the right nipple have changed in appearance and size, measuring 1.7 cm in maximal diameter. The previously ( mammogram done 15 months ago) noted sub centimeter punctuate calcifications at the immediate subareolar right breast is no longer identified. The left breast mammogram unremarkable and unchanged. Biopsy suggested. Should I be concerned.",
