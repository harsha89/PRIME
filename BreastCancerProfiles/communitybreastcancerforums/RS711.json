Lower your weight to the lower end of the body-mass index for your height. Even more important, banish belly fat, which acts like a \u2018hormone pump' releasing estrogen into the bloodstream as well as raising levels of other hormones. 3. Avoid sugary drinks and high-calorie foods. For blood sugar balance. 4. Eat more fruits and vegetables. 5. Eat less red meat and little or no processed meat. Red meat contains heme iron and other substances that damage the colon lining, making way for tumor growth. Processed meat is even worse. When meat is preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or by the addition of preservatives, cancer-causing substances (carcinogens) are formed that damage cells in the body, leading to cancer. While studies show we can eat up to 18 ounces a week of red meat without raising cancer risk, research shows that cancer risk starts to increase with any portion of processed meat. 6. Limit alcohol to two drinks a day for men, one for women-but none is best of all. Scientists are still researching how alcohol causes cancer. One theory is that alcohol can directly damage DNA, increasing our risk of cancer. Research shows that alcohol is particularly harmful when combined with smoking. 7. Limit salt intake. Salt and salt-preserved foods are linked to stomach and other digestive cancers; limit salt to 2400 milligrams to be safe.",
