Gave him all my records. He ordered me to get a port in asap. and immediately sent me to an oncologist. The oncologist sent me for a MRI, bone scan and PT CT Scan and set up a date for Chemo... Had surgery - port in my chest... Went for my tests... The day I was suppose to start Chemo is when the Oncologist Read the test results... He said that I have metastasis breast cancer and can not do chemo... I said why didn't you read the reports earlier I wouldn't have had the port put in... He apologized and said he made a big mistake. But it might be used down the road.. If it isn't blocked by then... He told me at that time no surgery. Drs have a hard time drawing blood at out this useless port, had a test on it... Flapper is stuck... My oncologist put me Ibrance and letrozole and monitors me monthly.. Six months later had all the test again, it showed the tumors shrunk... Both my Doctors were extremely pleased. Told to wait again and repeat the tests, No new tumors one they can't even find. In Feb repeat again all tests -- MRI showed a tiny new tumor in my left and a new nodule in my right... Oncologist and Breast Surgeon both agreed it was time to get out the primary tumors.. Have a mastectomy. I asked will this cure me? No of course not. ...Dr wants only to take the left breast - I ordered him to take both.... Drs said I will live a long life... Oncologist said 20 yrs or more... He is giving me great hope... I have the cancer in my right hip Femur, chest wall, lymph nodes. Surgery is all set for May 6th. If you need just to talk PM ",

Not what I have been use to all my life... Today, I decided to get a haircut, Like Helen Mirren...never had hair this short... But you know what, I like it so far...

Didn't talk to me at all after waiting over 8 hrs to see the dr. All they did was make an appt to have it biopsied. I was shocked, being no Dr at Sloan discussed this with me... So never went back, even though everything was 100% covered by my ins. My oncologist and breast surgeon put me on Ibrance and Letz. and did the wait and see... Months later scans showed my tumors decreased in size in by breast. They haven't mentioned another bone scan... I will mention it next visit. Both my drs want me to have BMX, get rid of the primary tumor. After that radiation... I have to find out if they will do my femur as well.",

I can't lift my right arm past my shoulder...I have 24/7 constant pain. No Dr will fix it. All due to the bone infection... I think when you are in one position too long, joints get too stiff. I worry that not being able to move my arms after surgery will cause more damage... I will try to move my arms, as long as it's ok with the doctor... Lymphedema can be caused by not raising your arms above your head... I know this since I had it in my leg after my THP. I had to see a lymphedema Therapist for a long time for treatment... Was told to lay on a wedgy, leg above the heart. My leg was wrapped with heavy bandages, not fun in the heat humid summer months... Plus had to wear a special custom made compression stocking... I will try to remember (wrote it down) to mention the nerve block... thanks for the tip. ",
