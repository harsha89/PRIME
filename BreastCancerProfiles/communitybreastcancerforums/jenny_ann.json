As I await my first diagnostic mammo I am making lists - questions, plans of action, personal history... I pray for the best of results for you and your family, including your mom. Jenn",

I have only told a few people and I don't want to blab on and on to them just yet. There's no reason for them to worry about what may or may not be. One more night done. Just 48 hours more and we can wake up and start getting real answers. I am going to call the breast center today and ask if my tests will be read and the results given to me right away. Like you I am wondering if I should be going into the city to a bigger breast center. My local hospital is tiny. It is something I will consider more, if needed, after my appointment. Have an easy day today! We need a few of those! Jenn",

I did stop by the center today when I was at the hospital with my kiddos. The radiologist WILL give me my results at my appointment. I am THRILLED about that.  On a less positive note... While I was checking out my breast in the mirror this morning (no need to explain to this crowd that particular obsessive behavior) I noticed something that I can only describe as an indentation. Only after looking for information about such a thing did I learn exactly what is meant by puckering/dimpling. In my mind I pictured it quite differently and so before that moment I assumed my lump was non-puckering. No longer... Waiting on Wednesday...",
