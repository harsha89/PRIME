Being near cancer and having cancer are two different animals. You are not being a wimp or weak. You are at a rough spot in the road, this is a rollercoaster ride at best. I had delayed depression, after my surgery. It happens, I was so busy being pro-active I was not accepting my cancer. Everyone's road is different, everyone's struggles are different. But what makes us sisters is the shared common enemy of cancer. Yes you are blessed to have \"just IDC stage 1\". but Sunflower you had breast Cancer!!!! It is scarey, it is hard but as many survivors will tell you \"doable\". You are doing fine, just a rough patch. You will cowboy up when you have to, but right now you need a hug and maybe some chocolate! Praying for you! PM anytime!!!! ",
