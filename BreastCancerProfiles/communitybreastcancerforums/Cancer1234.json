That I need to keep looking at site to see when \" recruiting\" I explained \"managed access \" right to try (\" really right to ask ) and why on Trials.gov , etc. Very unhelpful. Would not give any info to me, said not sure hwy posted on site . They said have my Dr call back..I was trying to get info for him. Is anyone using this managed access program ? I have ( 2 ) PIK3 mutations , progression on Ibrance, one to many AIs for the BYlieve trial . Would love to try Alpelisib before moving on to afintor or ????",
