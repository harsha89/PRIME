I love food, and the thought of potentially losing my sense of taste long-term scares me. NancyHB, I don't understand why your insurance company would deny to pay for the genetic testing. From a logical point, shouldn't it be exactly a \"case\" like yours, where there isnt an obvious family history, where testing should be covered?! Jenn28, Good for you, that it wasn't your memory, but the bank's fault.;-) I wasn't as lucky filling out an onlline order yesterday, I could not remember the last 2 (of 4) digits in my address. Total brain freeze and very scary. Janetanned, Hats off to you for not taking a leave from school. I have stopped volunteering in my older son's classroom, and have been keeping my younger son home from preschool since just before my surgery in December, because I am so scared of catching another bug. I cought the last one my son brought home from preschool, and it took me 3 weeks to recover, plus I also had to postpone my surgery. - I hate having to live like a hermit, and especially for depriving my children of some of their regular interactions, but I decided I can be selfish for once in my life, and to do what is best for me (although feeling guilty about it). Wishing all a good week, with few, if any, side effects and tears!!!",

      "Content": "Feb 5, 2012 08:31PM - edited Feb 5, 2012 08:46PM by SleeplessIn HI Madeline, Sorry to hear you are having such bad side effects. Like you, I also started AC on Jan. 13 (except dose-dense, every other week). - The first treatment was not all that bad for me, side effects were worst days 3 to 8 into it. Then on day 9-13 I was feeling almost \"normal\" again. The first time around I had eaten greek yogurt every day, which is supposed to fight candida/thrush, so I did not get any. After my second treatment I did not eat yogurt, and sure enough, I got thrush. But again, ate yogurt twice, and it was gone the next day. The one SE that is different this time is that my sense of taste is gone (still), today, day 9 after my 2nd treatment. :-( And I am cold a lot, which may have something to do with the fact that my head gets cold easily now that it's \"bold\", and my nose is constantly running (also probably just due to the fact that there is no nose hair to stop it). :-) FLDreamer, RachelVK, I have also had some sort of ear ache today. Wonder if it has to do with the fact that my long hair no longer covers my ears - and I spent an hour inside the freezing ice hockey rink, watching my kids today... kblack, This time around I have not bounced back as quickly as I did with the first treatment as well. Wonder how it's gonna be like after the upcoming third treatment....;-( My oldest son and I went wig shopping yesterday. After trying on what seemed like every wig in the store, I let him \"pick\" the wig that he thought suited me best (well, sort of), and then we went out for lunch afterwards. It was a \"fun\" outing, as weird as that may sound; may have also had a little something to do with the beautiful sunny day and blue sky. ;-) After getting home, my hubby shaved my head, which I had dreaded for so long. Weirdly, again, it felt really good to do it - afterwards anyway. No more dreading hair loss - it's gone! Such a relief! - I look in the mirror and see GI \"me\" - totally able and ready to start kicking cancer's butt!!! ",

Not for me, and not for many of us, it seems!!! - If pain persists, can you not take any more time off work if need be, or at the very least work from home? - I hope you (and your hubby) will be feeling better soon. Bela, hang in there!   Well. I had my final Taxol tx last Wednesday, and I am glad I stuck it out - when I was very close to quitting chemo after the debilitating first two dd Taxols. At the time my MO wanted to switch me to weekly infusions (saying that was going to be easier on my body - yeah right?!), after the pain meds barely worked for me. I refused. Luckily, SE after infusion 3 were much less severe than after the first two, and SE after number 4 even less so than after number 3. My white blood count has come back to normal range (7.3) for the last three weeks, up from only 3.3.-3.4 during AC and Taxol 1&2. - So for the last infusion I told the nurse I did not want the Neulasta shot. That ticked her off a bit, but I really didnt care much about being extra polite at that point! She said that she needed to double check with my Oncologist, and the MO was o.k. with it. - As a result, I am sooo glad to experience \"recovery\" without that darn shot. I'm one week out today, and what a difference it has made!!! I had 7 Neulasta shots over the past months, and this last infusion without the Neulasta has been the by far \"easiest\" in terms of bone pain. Yay!!! Finally. Now I am ready to move on with my life. Well, soon.... :-)  I have a ton of appointments in the next two weeks to figure out what kind of follow up treatment (if any) I will be doing. I'll have to weigh the risks with the benefits as best for ME, something that my \"wonderful\" and well respected MO doesn't really seem to understand or care about.  Has anyone else opted out of, or thinking about doing so, any additional treatment after chemo? Just wondering....  Gentle Hugs to all!!! ",

I couldnt agree more with what Nancy and Jennifer said, it sure seems like cancer is so much more prevalent these days then it used to be. Like you, growing up, I also do not recall knowing any (not one!!!) person who had cancer and /or died of cancer. Nor does my mother! Other than maybe due to a car accident, everyone in my family and my mom's circle of friends died from \"old age\". Despite the fact that everyone smoked and drank a lot more alcohol in the 60s and 70s. Not so these days. My children had several friends' moms die of breast cancer just these past two years. One lady's children were 6 (twins) years old at the time, the other lady's children were 5 and 9. One of my DH cousins was recently diagnosed with bc at age 29, and another one with uterine cancer at age 25. It is not \"normal\" for all these young women (and men) to get these cancers. It just isnt. As in regard to follow up care, Nancy, I feel the same way. While I am really tired of seeing doctors, it's also extremely scary to me to not get regular follow-up screenings. What adds to it is that I have not been pronounced NED after surgery and chemo, which REALLY bugs me. But on the other hand, I have not had any scans (ordered by my \"cancer treatment team\") since before surgery last year. Even if I had mets, they wouldn't know, because scans are not part of the \"standard protocol\" for someone with my pathology?! - And even with all the pain I have been experiencing over the past few months, they \"put it off\" to chemo SE; Some \" normal\", some \"rare\". End of story. I am very disheartened with the medical industry right now, particularly with my treatment at this\" top rated facility\". - Sorry for the ranting, just having one of those non-pms \"PMS\" days today!!! ;-) Hugs to all, especially Pc-barbie!!!",

A few days before my first chemo (Fri, the 13th) I wrote a long post myself, just before my computer power went out. Of course all my typing was gone when the power came back. Oh well. :-) So here I go again. I am scheduled for a total of 4 x AC (every other week), followerd by 4 x Taxol (every other week) right now. The Taxol part may be changed to weekly, I will have to see. I had gotten a second opinion (from an naturopathic oncologigist), and he suggested weekly EC instead of AC, followed by weekly Taxol. So now I am waiting to hear back from my regular oncologist as to what she thinks about that, or why she would want me to stay on this path.. I am 8 days out from my first dose of AC and feel ok for the most part. - The infusion itself was not uncomfortable at all. My port was numbed with a Licadene shot when they did bloodwork in the morning, so there were no issues. Later, when I got home from the infusion, I got really nauseous though, and actually even had to throw up. - I'm thinking maybe that was from the Neulasta? I noticed that most of you get the Neulasta shot on a different day. I wonder why? Mine are scheduled on infusion day, after I am done with everything else. Hm. Since treatment 1 I have only taken 2 of the pills that are supposed to help with side effects. I also followed the advice of some people on the board here, and rinsed my mouth with salt/baking soda - water combo several times a day the first few days afterwards, and have been wearing \"sea bands\" on my wrist. My naturopath suggested accupuncture, but I do not need it for now. I just don't want to add one more \"to do\" things to my list. I try to drink tea (ginger, peppermint and green tea), sometimes also Gatorade, as much as possible, but I just don't feel like I want to ingest anything most of the time. My son was eating a snack of roasted seaweed the other day, and the smell of it made me gag the same way the pure thought of eating the chocolate cookies I was eating during infusion made me gag. Haven't lost more hair than usual so far (60-100 hairs/day is considered normal), but also have not washed it (I know, kinda gross), because I want to hold on to it as long as I can. Some day soon, I told my kids that they can cut my hair short. Hoping that will take some of the scariness out of it for them (and for me). And then I'm planning on having my husband shave my head while thee kids are watching. I have an appointment for a wig-fitting next Friday (before chemo #2), and they told me it would be better to have no hair left for that. :-) Thank you all for sharing your stories, kind words, advice and support for everyone here. It means the world to me to know that I am not ALONE going through this.",

But even after all the side effects I have to say that I am glad that I am doing this aggressive treatment after all - because I feel that I am throwing everything and the kitchen sink at this crappy disease. I feel that the more aggressive the treatment, the better the benefit will be - and the distant recurrance is lowered, and psychologically it lets me feel like I have done what could have been done.

Sending you gentle hugs and positive thoughts. I know exactly how you feel like. The first two days after my first Taxol (dd, 300 ml) I felt better than I had the entire month before on AC. My hand and foot syndrome was almost gone and I was actually able to function normal. Then, day 3 I started having excrutiating bone, joint, muscle pain from my head to my tows - and everything in between, plus pelvic cramps and a sore throat. It lasted for 3 days at a pain level 8-9. I took Oxycodone! and it didn't touch the pain at all. So I added 2 Aleve to the Oxucodone and that brought the pain down to a level 7 maybe. I cried, and cried.... Like someone else put it so well. The last time I had this kind of pain, I left the hospital with a baby! And labor pain did not last 3 days!!!! For me, The pain subsided somewhat on day 6 post tx, but I still have intermittent pain in lower back, knees, headaches.... I have also noticed significant Chemobrain (cant come ip with names for people and things), which I did not have on AC, and have gained 4 pounds in the 9 days since I got the Taxol. I am really, really dreading the next Tx of Taxol!!!! I wonder if the Neulasta, which I get the day of my Tx, is to blame for some of this hellish bone pain? PS: I am taking 20 Mg of Glutamine powder (10mg twice a day dissolved in water), and vitamins B6/12 and Claritin for 3 days after Tx.",

She told me about a study that has not yet been published officially, but presented in San Antonio the year prior, and that the 4 x DD (bi-weekly)  was just as effective as the 12xweekly. Below is a study comparing 3 week Taxol and Taxotere with treatment every three weeks versus weekly. \"Overall, paclitaxel [Taxol] caused fewer side effects than docetaxel; however, peripheral neuropathy (grades 2, 3, and 4) was highest in the group treated with paclitaxel once a week.\" The report of this trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2008. Publication: Sparano JA, Wang M, Martino S, Jones V, et al. Weekly paclitaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. New England Journal of Medicine. 2008 Apr 17;358(16);1663-1671 Hope this helps. If you can find anything else, please let me know.",

Joints and bones hurt (especially the back, knee and hip bones), although I am glad to report that I finally had a bone scan, and it was ok!!! - You had asked about the \"window\" between the end of chemo and start of radiation, my RO (at a highly ranked university clinic) said they like to start within 8 weeks after end of chemo, however, their \"window\" is up to 12 weeks! I was 8 weeks out from chemo last Wednesday, and my team was thinking I may change my mind - which I am not. It took me a lot of agonizing to come to this conclusion, but after (too much?) reading a lot of studies and papers, and \"listening\" to my body, I know that I can Not do radiation. I will see my surgeon for my 6 month follow up soon, and am going to ask about possibly having a mastectomy instead. We will see. We all have to make and live with our choices, and it is not easy. I had a total of 8 eyebrows and 6 eyelashes after chemo, and now my brows are back almost completely and my eyelashes are also, almost 1/2 the length they were before.   Positive thoughts and hugs to all of you. I am so glad to have been part of this group on our shared journey during these past months. It made it all more bearable, albeit not \"easy\" per se. :-)",

The findings, released today, will be presented on Monday, June 4 in an oral presentation at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). It builds on previous research showing the vaccine, known as AE37, to safely and effectively raise immunity against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) \u2013 an oncoprotein that promotes tumor growth and is expressed to some extent in 75-80% of breast cancer tumors. The researchers found that patients who received the vaccination had an estimated recurrence rate of 10.3% compared to 18% in the control group at a median follow up of 22 months....\"  http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/news-releases/2012/hybrid-vaccine.html",

My favorite walk is along Seaward Park, 2.3 mile loop, perfect distance for me and my youngsters, and the view is lovely. Not just the water but sometimes also of Mt. Rainier. - Hope spring will come sooner this year than it did last year, though. That rain seemed like it was never-ending. NancyHB. Wow! Running 2.5 miles the day after chemo - that is something else!!! Awesome!!! - I could have not done that prior to chemo.:-)  And Yoga, too. I agree that stretching and yoga (and really all exercise) provide awesome benefits for not just the body, but also the mind. Keep doing what you are doing, even if it's at a slower pace. I hear you in terms of being afraid of your heartbeat. I went hiking and snow shoeing the week before I started chemo and my heart rate was fine. Now, after starting chemo, my heart starts pounding hard - quickly. I can definitely tell how fast its going when I'm on the elliptical and holding on to the heart rate monitor. Just gotta roll with the punches sometimes, I guess. Regarding the port, mine is not moving, but it feels awkward to have it. I am always aware that it is there. My 5-year old bumped into it (well my chest) yesterday, and I screamed. Not in pain, but because it felt weird, like it just shouldn't be touched. Ok, off to school pick-up. First I need to \"de-hair\" myself, I guess. I cut my hair to chin-length yesterday, 17 days past my first AC tx, and it is still falling out pretty badly... I hope I can hold onto some of it until Fri, when I have my new appointmt for wig fitting. Can't believe it's been so hard to let go of my hair. :-( Good luck, and few SE with your AC #2!!! - Counting down the treatments, that's the way I'm looking at it. :-) ClaireinAZ: Thank you for your post. - I know it is so important to stay hydrated, but it's just so hard to get myself to \"put\" anything in my mouth sometimes, especifially something that will fill up my stomach and may (or probably will) make it feel worse. - The mere thought of drinking more ginger tea, peppermint tea (and/or eating many foods) makes me nauseous these days.",

So glad I did. It took about an hour to start working but helped so much. I'm starting to think I need to push myself to get more exercise. I can't imagine walking around my block, much less walk 30 blocks, but I'm determined to make a better effort going forward. I was walking 3 miles a day before my surgery. It's so easy to become lazy when you have an excuse. ",

I had the double mastectomy too and just when I felt like the pain was finally tolerable I had the port put in (yesterday) and I feel so beat up today. I cried in the parking lot after grocery shopping with my husband because I was so tired of being in so much pain. I'm doing the opposite however - I think I've gained at least 5 lbs this past month (stress eater). I do think the worst of the physical pain is over. Now it will be more emotional. I honestly get through it each day by counting my blessings, and I thank God it is me with cancer and not one of my children. Cancer sucks, but we can do this. Please see if your cancer center has someone you can talk to and hang in there. You're stronger than you know and you're not alone.",

However, I am wondering exactly the same thing, and no one has been able to give me an answe that makes sense. - If one has chemo following surgery (I did chemo because of grade 3 and high oncotest score), then why does require additional treatment with radiation, too?! Chemo is supposed to kill or stop cancer cells from growing further (depending on the chemo), and it targets the entire body, right?! So is the breast not also part of that entire body?! Therefore chemo should also kill any stray cells left over in the breast and avoid local recurrance, shouldnt it?! - For me it's really hard hard choice to make, given that my RO (who is also a professor and practices at a NCI designated center) told me there is NO WAY to completely avoid the heart and part of the lungs, if they were to radiate my left breast. So with a relatively small cancer, clean margins and clear sentinel lymph nodes, as of right now I think the rsik/benefit is simply not in favor of radiation. In my case, that is. I am keeping an open mind and have a bit over 3 weeks to make up my mind. For now, I am looking forward to completing chemo in two days. What a ride it has been - but glad I did that part. Yay!!!!",

I am 40 years old, and therefore there is a good chance that I may get another cancer at some point. That said, treating me with Chemo, followed by Rads (left breast) and 5 years of Tax feels a bit much, particularly since the very real long term side effecs of all these treatments are known to include secondary cancers and very serious heart disease. - Having said this, I also agree with some of the other posts here, that doctors prescribe what they do just to be on the safe side. And in my opinion, also to not open themselves up to potential lawsuits. Personally, I am open to explore less conventional treatments perhaps (after having had a lumpectomy and undergoing chemo right now), if that can be geared more to my personal situation and medical history. I have not made a choice yet, but continue to read and learn for now. I also have an appointment with a naturopathic oncologist next week, to see what other treatment options may be. There are many paths and options for treatment, I believe. Unfortunately all the choices are Not presented to us on a display to pick and choose. It takes a lot of time, reading, time, reading...
