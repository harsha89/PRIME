The change in personality could be due to number of factors - stress, brain mets (heaven forbid). Speak to a mental health professional if possible immediately. My mother has stage 4 BC and I noticed a change in her personality as well. However, in our case it was definitely due to brain mets and the sheer stress of going through this horrid experience. I wish you lots of good luck and hope things works out.",
