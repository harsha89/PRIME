I got aloe vera gel (one with lidocaine; one without), calendula gel, and Sea Buckthorn Oil. After I saw my RO for the first visit, his prescription for me was the green tea spray and the Mometasone cream. Well, I couldn't let all that other stuff go to waste, so I used the green tea spray 3 times a day, used the calendula in the morning (before going to work), and used the Mometasone at night (usually put some on after work and again before bed). I guess it all worked because I never really had any sunburning or skin issues. I did have a little pain where my two scars are (lumpectomy and lymph node), but nothing that was unbearable. I'm now using the Sea Buckthorn Oil on my face at night...lol. Good luck to you!",

I found mine at Stein Mart, but you can probably find them at Wal Mart or Target. I think they have them on the Hanes.com website too. ",

Also, I just wanted to mention that neither my RO nor any radiation tech ever told me to stop wearing deodorant. I was radiated on the right breast. Having said that, I didn't usually wear it anyway on that side since I was using the green tea spray and Mometasone cream in the armpit area. My radiation center also used the \"molds\" so I didn't have to hold onto handles like at some places. And I didn't have to hold my breath since I wasn't being treated on the heart side. You can co this, ladies!",

Anyone else dealing with this, or dealt with it? I know everyone heals at a different rate, but this is really irritating. Saw my dr yesterday for post-op and he said my lymph node incision looks good, but just said nerve healing takes time. Ugh. The lumpectomy was a breeze.
