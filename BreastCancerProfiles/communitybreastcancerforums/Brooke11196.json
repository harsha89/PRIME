    "Content": "Brooke11196 wrote: Hello everyone, I am very worried. I tend to have a lot of heath anxiety in general, but I'm very worried about this. I am 21 year old female. No family history of breast cancer. Normal weight/non smoker. I have saline implants under the muscle. After my argumentation surgery I had a lot of nerve damage in my left breast leading from the bottom of the breast up through the bottom half of my left nipple. When my nipples become erect when I am cold, the bottom part of the areola doesnt get hard and seems slightly puffy. This has been going on for months, I always just thought this was due to the nerve damage in that area. Recently I was having some anxiety about it and started feeling around on my areola and it seems I may have a small hard lump underneath. I have no discharge, no discoloration. I was recently ill and was in and out of the doctors and had many tests. CBC blood count. CT of abdomen and pelvis for severe pain and follicular cyst on left ovary. everything always comes back completely normal. Never had any breast testing aside from a look over from my gynecologist in January but he did not even feel around my aereola/nipple, just the sides of the breast My step brother has been battling a rare form of cancer and since then, my health anxiety has been out of the roof. Any advice will help. Thank you so much for your time in reading this. Log in to post a reply",
