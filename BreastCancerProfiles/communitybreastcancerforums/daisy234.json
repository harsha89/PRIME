It almost 3 weeks Bug whoever you can..ask why.......demand answers ...it is your right. .Don't know where you are but in CA I believe there is a law on how long a pathologydiagnosis should take . Each state has a set of laws - check it out. Hugs........ ",

This is wrong -no matter who the dr. is. Women need to know that diagnostic results are regulated under official guidelines. There is a Pathologic Association that pathologists must belong to and the guidelines are posted on that site online [sorry but don't have the exact name but it is easily found -- Just  Google Official Guidelines for Diagnostic Pathology. It should state the timeline for reporting results to a patient.  For example in CA - a pabst smear  result MUST be reported to a patient within 10 days or it is in violation of the law.  T hank goodness you had the smarts to check things out on your own.",
