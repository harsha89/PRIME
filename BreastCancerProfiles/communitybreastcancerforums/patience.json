I'm the kind of person who needed to know exactly what was going on in the breast AND I wanted the cells gone not radiated. That was how I felt, but I think most choose not to have a mastectomy. I am happy with my decision - it's been seven years since my diagnosis. My new breast (saline implant) is just a part of me now and I have never regretted my decision. Good luck with your surgery and recovery- Patience",

My needle biopsy indicated only DCIS (noninvasive breast cancer) to the post lumpectomy diagnosis -aggresive invasive ductal carcinoma with lymph node involvement. Once I had a treatment plan and started my chemo I felt a sense of purpose -beating the cancer so that i would be there for my kids, my husband and friends and then getting well and strong after the chemo and surgeries (5 when all was said and done). Chemo is rough, but it is doable and you will receive lots of support and advice here. It hsa been seven years and luckily I can not remember it very well- but others just finished will give you suggestions (practical and also to get you through those really difficult thoughts that creep up). You need the chemo - and the radiation to fight the cancer so that you can get back to your life and your kids and grandkids. Being ER and PR positive and Her negative are all good things. What kind of chemo is your oncologist reccomending? When will you start? patience",

Dana Farber, I believe, requires you have a consultation with one of their doctors when they review slides but this is not the case at other cancer centers. I did not question whetehr i was already at a good hospital with competent pathologists in deciding to have the review - it was more a case of wanting a second set of eyes (very experienced ones in this case) to report what they found in the tissue as well. A friend had her slides reviwed at Sloan Kettering. I think for both of us it was reassuring - even though in both cases they did find micromets in lymph nodes that were not seen on the first pathology. The good news was that was 'all' that they found and it did affect whether my friend received chemo or not 5 years ago. She did - it had not been planned - after the slides were reviewed. But she also felt confident there was only micromets in the nodes.",

And it is good the radiologist is going to follow up the finding of epithelial hyperplasia with a mammogram in three months. I think if you feel at all like the surgeon did not answer your questions about what the epithelial hyperplasia was and what the concern was (did you have an excisional biopsy?) that you should ask for another appointment. Also, you can request a review of the pathology - which means another set of eyes (or actually three sets) reviewing the tissue without you having additional biopsies. It is great no cancer was found-",
