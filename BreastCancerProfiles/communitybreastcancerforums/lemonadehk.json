Although my symptoms are better (no fever, less cough), the Xray was pretty much the same as last week. So frustrated... MO asked me to rest for another week. He said usually it takes weeks for pneumonia to completely clear up on XRay, but we can't wait that long. He also told me to skip the last AC because the white cell suppression might cause pneumonia to come back. He told me to move on to Taxol next week. He said since I had one TC already before I started AC-T, 3 ACs + 4 Taxols should be sufficient. I guess I have to listen to him given the pneumonia situation. In a way I am relieved that I don't have to the last AC because my heart has been racing really fast lately (from a baseline of 70 to 100+).",

For the 1st one, I was having nausea in the first few days and fatigue; by day 4, I was feeling pretty good already. But for the 2nd one, in addition to nausea, I had shortness of breadth and extreme fatigue, which lasted for a week. The MO said it's chemo-induced anemia, which is quite common for AC.

      "Content": "Apr 8, 2015 09:57AM - edited Apr 8, 2015 10:09AM by lemonadehk Hi all, I am new to the group. I actually started my first chemo on March 6 (TC x 4). But just before my 2nd chemo session, I had a panic attack and decided to change to a more aggressive treatment (which was also on the table when I was making the decision). Now I am doing dose-dense AC-T (4 biweekly AC and 4 biweekly Taxol). My first AC was on April 1, so I consider myself starting in April :) Compared with TC, AC is a lot harder. I almost didn't feel anything with TC, just a bit tired and short of breath for 2-3 days and that was it. But with AC, I started feeling it right away. I was really nauseous and sleepy for 3-4 days. Now it's been a week, the nausea is much better but I still have a poor appetite. I am already dreading my second AC next week. Good luck to us all with getting through the chemo! -- Lemonade",

Both are NCCN preferred regimens for stage 1 & 2 breast cancer. There is a phase III clinical trial (SWOG S0221) showing that both AC-T schedules ha same efficacy but slightly different toxicity profiles (maybe weekly Taxol slightly less toxic). But 12 weekly Taxol is longer. So when my MO suggested biweekly Taxol, I didn't object.",

Need to decide asap since it's been 5 weeks PFC. I am 36, BRCA2+, stage 1B with 1 micrometastasis in 1 sentinel node, multifocal (12 rumors and the biggest is 4mm), mastectomy with level 1&2 dissection, then had AC-T for chemo. I saw quite a few ROs and the majorty said I don't need it, but my attending RO is leaning towards doing it. The reasons for not doing it are (1) my biggest tumor is only 4mm, and (2) the positive LN is a micro (<2mm); reasons for doing it include: (1) my age (2) multifocal nature of the tumor, (3) the pathology report did not report some accidentally discovered LCIS cells in a random block of issue. I want to throw everything at this cancer, but scared of the long term effect of rads (lung damage, second malignancy etc., mine is on the right, so minimum heart damage). The fact that the majority ROs said the benefit is minimal also makes me hesitant, although my husband said my primary RO is the one who knows my case the best and I should trust him.

      "Content": "lemonadehk wrote: I just finished my chemotherapy. I started with 1 cycle of TC, then switched to dose-dense AC-T (4 x biweekly AC followed by 4 biweekly Taxol). After the 3rd AC, I developed pneumonia. MO thought it would be unsafe to proceed with AC, so after one extra week of rest, I moved on to Taxol. Just finished my last Taxol yesterday. I had asked MO whether I need to do a makeup session for the last AC I missed. He said it's not necessary considering I had 1 TC upfront. He said 4 TC is more effective than 4AC, so by extrapolation, 1TC should be similar to be 1AC. And since my body seems to react badly to AC, he doesn't think the benefits outweigh the risks. He said since I am luminal A subtype, hormonal therapy would offer me the most benefit anyways. I also consulted another MO about this and he agreed with my MO's decision of not doing the last AC. So yesterday at the last Taxol infusion, I told my MO that I would listen to him and not do the last AC. But somehow I feel that I cheated by not doing to complete regimen. So I am here to look for some reassurance from my fellow sisters! Thank you!

So I decided to have prophlactic mastectomy on the left side to be safe. The surgery will be next week. My surgeon suggested that I consider sentinel node dissection. She said there is a small possibility of false negative for MRI and mammogram imaging tests. If it turns out that there is cancer, then I would need an anxillary dissection. And since I had anxillary dissection on my right already, it would not be good if I have to have anxillary dissection on the left as well. Has anyone had prophylactic mastectomy? Did you have sentinel node dissection? I would appreciate any thoughts/input.
