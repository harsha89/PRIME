    "Content": "Lilyrog wrote: Hi all. Age late 20s. A while back, I felt a hard marble or grape sized lump in my lower right breast about 10 months post partum. It feels deep under tissue so it's hard to say whether it's smooth or feels rigid due to tissues or veins or something of that nature. Even long before my pregnancy, I had horrible back pain and still have pretty bad back pain in the center of my back that even hurts to wear a normal bra most days. I still wear a super loose maternity bra in order to compensate for this. Im not overweight nor have I had any other health issues. My breasts get abnormally tender during my period and I originally chalked off the lump to hormones. However, my little one is now over a year and I realized it never went away. The lump itself doesn't hurt but my right breast itself stays tender but my left is not at all. I currently am without insurance and working on trying to get something so i cannot get in right away for a mammogram. Does this sort of lump relate to anything someone else has delt with?
