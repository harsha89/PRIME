Just about 9 months after my last mammo I began to feel pain in my right breast. I asked for an ultra sound. I am with an HMO and they have given me false reports in the past on an injury I had so I'm a bit concerned on whether or not I can trust their reports. That said, I had a friend who's survived breast cancer sit in on the ultrasound and she said that there was a kidney bean shaped cyst/lump/etc and two normal looking round ones. I requested a copy of the actual ultra sound. On the ultra sound cd image itself, there are measurments of all 3 cysts. The kidney bean shaped cyst measurment  is numbered 1L  & 2L  On the 1L measurement it says 8.05cm and on the 2L it says 3.32cm. The two yellow lines cross each other. On the other two cysts the measurements are: RT OV LNG/TRV A) 1. 2.88cm   2.1.80cm  and B) 3. 2.82 cm. On A they cross and on B it's just a straight yellow line.  Now here's where it gets weird. On my ultrasound report it reads the following: Right breast appears to show a cyst at 12 o clock measuring 0.99 x 0.64 x 0.70 cm, and two cysts are noted at 6 o clock measuring 0.49 x 0.7 and 0.55 x 0.46 cm. Can someone please tell me why the report doesn't match what's on the actual ultrasound? Am I missing something here? I'm really worried. My Dr. said despite the fact that I have pain, and my report reveals nothing more than cysts, he is going out of his way to send me to a surgeon for  a biopsy because I'm the ONE special patient he has.  Which by the way hasn't happened yet b/c the one he sent me to isn't accepting anymore patients. Any suggestions or advice is greatly appreciated.",
