      "Content": "Lovelyme123 wrote: hi i am 20 years old a single mom of a 2 year old. I had my bc removed because of irregular bleeding and went on the pill to ease pain from an ovarian cyst. The bleeding didnt stop so i went on the depo shot. The shot stopped my bleeding 3 days after but my body started hurting. But i read it was normal but recently my right boob has been hurting. Its bigger than my left but i think its always been like that. I also have like armpit fat more on my right then left. But i always had a fat armpit since i can remember. My armpit pain started a long time ago but it wasnt constant. It was just a sting here and there after i shaved them or put on deodorant. But now its more and more daily i have not put on deodorant to see if this was the cause and its not i been using a natural crystal deodorant. And i feel bad because i have really bad underarm odor so bad sometimes i have to use lemons to help the odor minimize. I had this issue since i forst shaved my armpits. (The odor) at 14. I naturally have a weird nipple i wouldnt say inverted as it does stick out but its like not exactly round. I always been embarrassed about it and since i was 8 if i squeezed it hard enough white stuff would come out of course i never told my mom cuz i was scared and eventually forgot about it and my ex told me when he bit my tit some stuff came out but he was sure it was prob milk?.( This was 7 months ago.) It doesnt always come out only when i squeeze my nipple super hard. Anyways i get stings under my armpit but also in my right armpit and my right breast. I had gone like 2 months ago to the obgyn and she examined my breast and told me there was no lumps no dents no rash nothing that indicated bc so she said it was probably hormones. I was upset she didnt send me to do a mammogram but at that point my boobs stopped hurting and yes i did get a period 5 days after that. My boobs do have little bumps on the aerolas which are painless but they always been that way. :/. I alwaus hated my boobs and weird nipple i vaguely remember back then taking pics with my arms closed cuz that lump of fat on my armpit. I have no swollen lymph nodes that i can feel. My left collar bone hurts when i press on it. It doesnt look swollen but it is more prominent then my right one but i think i am not sure if i always had it that way. Back 4 months ago i did notice it but i was more concerned for non hogkins lymphoma. Because i was having a cough that wouldnt go away and night sweats never figured out what it was the cough stopped on its own. I also would feel pain on my spleen but after 3 xrays i was like Yeah i dont want to increase my chance of over radiation and end up with cancer because im scared of cancer. (I watched my grandma die this year in may of breast cancer it was so horrifying. She was diagnosed 2 weeks prior and was given a month to live she was not fit for any chemo she couldnt walk couldnt eat had an oxygen mask it was clear it was the end..she was immediately sent to hospice. Where she died not even 2 weeks after given a month to live. I never thought i would lose her so soon she was a troopershe had diabetes and suffered a stroke a yr prior) she was angry because we didnt let her do chemo but she wasn't fit for it as the drs said she was basically relying on a oxygen machine to breathe she could barely move. The 2nd day being admitted to the hospital she coudlnt walk anymore. I felt so bad because there was nothing we could do. When the morphine wasnt working fast enough we had to endure hearing her yell in pain. She eventually couldnt open her eyes and became very swollen. I am so traumatized by it. She never did get mammos or did self checks or anything. She just said one day she was coughing and felt like something burst inside of her. It was the tumor. My collar bone and boobs hurt. I have been touching them non stop but im so scared it cancer. Then i heard about cancer running in families. My moms brother died of leukaemia at age 25 back in 93 he died within months i want to say either 3 or 6 months. Her sis was diagnosed with cercival cancer at age37 but been in remission for 14 years. I am worried i have ibc or some sort of bc. My boobs are in so much pain i want to cry. The pain goes down my arms even when i told the dr that she told me it was the bc. Like just the simple pass of my fibger btings so much pain to my boobs. Idk wbag ig is but ive been freaking out:( Log in to post a reply",
