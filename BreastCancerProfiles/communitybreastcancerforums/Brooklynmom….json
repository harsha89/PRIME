Clear margins but node was positive - I was told that new protocol meant that node being positive was not too concerning because tx would take care of it . I was also told that in my case - 2 small tumors 1 idc and 1 dcis they were small enough and close enough that clear margins would be just as effective w a lumpectomy as a bmx. I saw my med onc for first time and she seemed to give me a choice of cmf - radiation and armidex or radiation and armidex - but I am really confused and overwhelmed. Didn't get oncotype yet so I'm still waiting on that . She said if oncotype was 20 cmf/radiation and anti hormone would reduce recurrence 6-7% while only radiation and anti hormone would be 10%. Then I read about estrogen testing I'm already in menopause - I don't have history of breast cancer but have other cancers in mom dad and sister ? Any body have similar situation? Thanx for any help support",
