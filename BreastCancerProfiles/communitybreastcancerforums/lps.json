I will admit to being quite anxious especially about the (admittedly low) risk of permanent hair loss. I think that would be really tough. But that answer is a number of months off so no point in getting worked up about it now, right?",

The steroids taken before the treatment is throwing off my sleep, which is not helpful, but that is about the worst so far. I find the Neulasta device a bit odd to have attached but it completed its cycle this afternoon without problems. So, so far so good. As others on this site have had luck with the dark nail polish to prevent nail problems, I will give it a try as well. I am assuming it is only your hands that you need to worry about to polish and not toenails? Any guidance would be great!",
