My only pep talk (to both of us) is that we fight hard and with dignity for our girls; my daughter is in 3rd grade.  All the best to you.  ",

The discomfort with the expanders has been manageable although my arm feels very \"tingly\" like the circulation is partially cut off. I am thankful to be home and hoping for good results from the pathology this week. My entire neighborhood now knows I have the 'c' word so I am now explaining over and over to relative strangers how I am \"doing \". The well intentioned concern is both welcome and appreciated and not. Does that sound horrid and ungrateful? I don't mean it to be but part of me isn't eager to talk to people at the bus stop about this. So the humorous moment of the week came from Jordan, a 6 year old classmate of my son, who reported my condition to her mom with this description. \" Graham's mom got mold her in her mouth and it spread to her breast so they are going to cut it off. But it's ok, because they are going to replace it with a fake breast that is firmer and that's good.\" I laughed so hard my bad side hurt. All the best to all of you.",

Can anyone tell me, can you feel this thing growing because I swear I can and I'm totally freaked out.  I really can't do surgery until early October due to work commitments and I'm totally afraid this is seeping into my lypmph nodes which at this point the MRI shows as clear.  All the best to both of us. ",

I was diagnosed about 3 weeks ago and want to delay surgery until early October so I can \"clear the decks\" at work.  But now I feel a slight burning sensation in that breast (could totally be in my head because I'm thinking about it all the time) and wondering if this thing is on the march toward my lymph nodes.  All likely imaginary.... The surgeon called it stage 2 grade 2 (this was before the MRI) -- said it was \"garden variety\".  Thanks for the input.",
