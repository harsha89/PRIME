You have come to the right place to get help on the bc journey you are starting on.  There is a thread for almost every question you my have and if there isn't start one.  We all love a new topic. I have learned so much in the month I have been on line.  Now I am hooked.  I go up and survey the boards just to see what is new.  So jump on in the water is fine... pattyinarnold",
