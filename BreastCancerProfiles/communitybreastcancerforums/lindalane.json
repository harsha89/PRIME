This was the biggest area of concern with the 1st u/s. He said if the shadowing is associated with the cyst, then it shoud resolve on it's own and I would not require a biopsy. But he said he wanted to see me in a month (Mar 1) and do another u/s. If the shadowing is still there, he will do a biopsy then. He said he is not comfortable waiting any longer than the month. I asked him if he thought it looked like a malignancy and he said he didn't know. I was just wondering if anyone here has had the shadowing on an u/s and what it meant for them. Thanks!!

I hope you understand I am not trying to be critical.Just so I understand, you have dense breast tissue with a cyst and a lymph node that showed up- right? If seeing another doctor would make you more at ease- then by all means, do so. I hope you can get some peace soon. Try to enjoy the holidays!!! Linda",

I found another lump in my left breast ( have had 2 benign bx in the left breast) about 5-6 mos ago but did not have it checked until today. I know, I know I should not have waited but I have other health issues and very poor insurance and just felt I could not afford to have it checked when I first found it. This lump is in a different area and feels totally different than the other 2 that I have had in the past. I had a check up with my int. med dr today for my thyroid and mentioned it to him. He did an exam and also felt the lump. It probably is pea sized at about the 11 o'clock position. I am scheduled for a mammogram and ultrasound next Fri. I know it most likely will not show up on the mammo. as my breasts are very dense. Is there a \"certain \"way benign vs malignant lumps feel? I was reluctant to even mention to my dr as I thought it might be just \"normal anatomy\". But I thought I might as well as get my money's worth from my visit.Â But he could definetly (sp) feel it. He said it possibly could be fibrocystic but he doesn't know. I am trying not to worry about it too much- I haven't even told my husband yet. It probably is nothing. Anyway, I am back and will keep you posted. Linda Log in to post a reply",

Ever since I had the biopsy in March for abnormal shadowing- I had a cyst that resolved but the shadowing on u/s persisted- my left breast has not felt right. I know that sounds corny but I don't know how else to say it. I never followed up after the benign report as money is tight right now and my ins. doesn't pay much.(long story). The other lump I had was a fibroadenoma when I was pregnant about 11 yrs ago. What's even odder, my twin sister also has a lump in her left breast now but she will not go get it checked. I talked to her tonight and she said she might after I have mine checked. My older sister just had her thyroid removed yesterday because of cancer.My father had colon cancer almost 2 yrs ago. Anyway, jsut wanted to say thanks. Linda",
