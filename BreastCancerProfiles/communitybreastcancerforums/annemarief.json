I was stage 1 and my tumors were 3 mm and 2 mm. I was one lucky woman getting diagnosed so very early. I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have about the surgery or recovery or life after two years. :) Feel free to email me directly at annemariefeldman@verizon.net ",

I had a bilateral mastecomy in Nov 2010 with Lat Dorsal immediate reconstruction. Two things that I don't think I could have lived without were my support system and my power recliner. I read on this message board from another member how important this one piece of furniture would be so I went out and bought one from a local retailer (Bob's Discount Furniture, but Macy's has also) for under $500. I cannot tell you how much this chair improved my recovery. I didn't feel trapped because with the push of a button I was sitting straight up and able to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night without having to ask my husband for help. I slept in it for the first 3 weeks. It was my go-to place when I needed to decompress and rest.  Now I look at that chair over two years later and still feel so grateful to it! If you can't spend the money on it, try to see if a friend has one they would loan to you for a month or so. If you are anywhere near Morristown NJ I will loan you mine. Honestly, just let me know. I had many angels with me during my recovery and that chair was one of them!  Annemarie :)",
