About 4 or 5 months ago I was loading a friends horse into a trailer when she spooked and jumped into the trailer knocking her head directly into my chest. It of course hurt like heck  and it was very,very sore afterwards for the longest time. It however did not ever bruise. Since then I have still had lingering persistent pain in my left breast. It is always in the same area, near the underarm area. I'm not sure but I think I may have felt a lump the other morning when I was taking a shower. Also there is a noticeable indentation above my left breast as well. Like I stated earlier I have been doing research so I'm not really sure if this is anything to be concerned with or not. I have made an appointment to see a doctor next week but I am a little anxious. I do have to say that my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer last year, she is thankfully in remission now, but I know that some of the research I have done seems sort of split on the chances of developing cancer if an immediate family member has had it. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

I posted this question in the waiting for test results forum because I wasn't really sure where it belonged. Long story short, my pain in the left breast started getting worse last week and changed. It also felt as if my left breast was swollen. I'm a small cup size anyways so I don't ever feel my breasts rub against my arm but last week several times I was more aware of my left breast whenever I went to do anything. It was very sore and sometimes it felt like there was a lead weight sitting on the bottom of my breast pulling down the on the nipple as well. The pain would sometimes radiate from the bottom into the center and it was a hot stabbing pain. Twice driving home on my rough roads I almost pulled over and cried because my breast being jostled hurt so much. Even at work I couldn't hurry to fast because it hurt too much. I got the letter from the place where I had my mammo and it stated everything looked fine however they wanted me back in 6 months to be sure nothing had changed in the left breast. However it also stated they felt I should contact my Dr. to see if she wanted anymore tests done. I finally called her about the change in my pain mostly and also told her what the letter said. They called me back and are sending me for a CAT scan next week. The nurse told me this was based on the results from my mammo. She never mentioned my reporting the pain being different. They want me back in there for a consult with the Dr. to discuss the results of my tests. I'm really nervous and worried now thinking that something is wrong and they just don't want to say  so yet. Should I be worried about this? Does BC ever show up on CAT scans? Please somebody answer and let me know what you think.",

I'm thrilled the CT scans came up negative but I still don't know whats wrong. The pain has been getting worse and now it has spread where it hurts in the underarm and up by my collarbone. My breast feels swollen still and is still warmer than the other one. I just can't seem to get any answers at all. I did call and ask about getting my mammo results and they said they get them to me.

I don' know how much more of this I can take. I can't get any answers. The pain is getting progressively worse week after week. I have been going through this for over a month now. The pain is a hot stabbing pain when it flares up real bad and then goes to a constant ache. I can't sleep at night because I can't get comfortable, it hurts driving when the seatbelt is pressing against my breast. I am starting to get really worried that this might be IBC. I have the constant breast pain, and my breast is always warm to the touch. I've read that it cant be detected with either Ultrasounds, Mammos, CATs. I still havent got my mammos yet all I have to go on is what the dr. told me which is I have calcifications and thickening of the skin. Is there anybody out there that has IBC and had these symptoms?",

And that they recommended that I contact my dr. to see if any additional tests were needed. No mention of the calcifications or thickening of the skin like I was told in the facility. Is this normal? There was no technical info on it all. Just a plain typed letter. The only reason I really contacted my dr. was because the pain had changed and was hurting so much on two separate occasions. They had told me to contact them if there was any changes in the pain I was experiencing. I don't understand why I'm having a CAT scan, from what the nurse told me I'm supposed to fast for 4 hrs before it so it sounds like there going to be using dye. I'm just not getting any answers from anybody. One dr. says I'm fine but come back cause you have calcifications and thickening of the skin and from the research I've done neither one of those things are good. My left breast is still hotter then the right breast, I told my dr. that and she acted like it  might still be from the incident with the horse. I don't see how it could still be hot for 5 months. I'm just so confused and don't know what to do. Why would they go from see you in 6 months and then my dr. decides she wants a CAT scan done now based on the results of my mammo. I don't even know the results of my mammo. Is it normal for them to want you back in 3-4 days afterwards to discuss findings. My mind is just convinced that all this is bad news. I've searched my symptoms online and it keeps coming up with Inflammatory breast cancer. Please if anybody has any ideas or suggestions please let me know, I can't talk to my mom about this cause I know it's going to stress her out more than she already is. I don't want to worry any of my friends, I just don't know what to do.",

The pain has been pretty bad today, tried taking advil, tylenol anything and it doesn't do much for the pain.It feels like theres a lead weight sitting in the bottom of my breast. The whole breast and underarm is tender and really sore today.  Just feeling really down right now not knowing and worrying over what could be wrong. I'm only 38 and I know that bc rarely strikes younger women but my mom was diagnosed with bc a few years ago. There's a lot of cancer on her side of the family, she lost her dad, and two sisters to different types of cancer so that only adds to my worry. I'm just feeling really lonely in all of this, I don't have anybody to talk to about this. I don't want to worry my mom and I don't want to say anything to my friends about it. I've always just handled things on my own, but right now this is just kinda too much for me.",

I called my dr. again to tell her that the pain is getting worse and I really need to get this figured out, it is affecting my work, it is waking me up at night on the nights that I can actually sleep from the pain that is. I have told her that the pain has changed from when I originally went in. I called her 5 times over the course of several weeks and all I ever got was the nurse or receptionist. This dr. is only a general practice, she's the one who ordered the mammo,ultras and ct scan. Today the nurse calls me back after I called them again last night after having to leave work early because of the pain, and all she says is the dr. just wants me to follow up with my app. next week. This is why I don't go to dr.s. I hadn't been to a dr. in 9 years before this except when I had to have carpal tunnel surgery on both hands. And this pain right now is far worse than the pain I went through after surgery. The accident happened August of 2010 so I dont see how in the hell it could still be hurting now, especially since it quit hurting a few weeks after the accident only to start up again a few months ago. I have been going through this severe breast pain for over 2 months now and it only keeps getting worse and I'm sick of it. Nobody seems to listen to me, all I get is people just brushing me off telling me well its nothing serious so..... Well to me it has to be something to be hurting this damn long, I've been through the reality of breast cancer my mom is a survivor and still has to go in and have blood taken out of her port to be tested, which there getting ready to remove soon I think. I was there with her through chemo, radiation, crying with her when she lost her hair and she had to find a wig. She wouldnt go out in public for over a month because she was so self concious of her wig. I had to call the actual facility where they did the mammo to get my report which I FINALLY found out that I had microcalcifications that were benign, no biopsy, and my BIRAD rating is a 3. I never could get that info from my dr. all I ever got was we'll get back to you. I'm just so sick and tired of getting blown off by people.",

It was my first time seeing this dr. and seemed really nice but I just didn't seem to get much info from her. She did say that my left breast was very lumpy, she believed that I had alot of cysts present.She didn't say the same for the right breast though.  I don't remember the term she called that but she did state that they are more often then not benign. She did schedule a mammogram and an ultrasound for the 6th. She didnt really answer why I would continue to feel a hot spot there and when I asked about being very tender and sore she said that it was probably due to the incident with the horse. Which I'm sure it is but lately if my arm or any sort of pressure is put on it, it is very uncomfortable and painful.",

What does that have to do with anything? I asked him that and he wouldn't answer me. Has anyone dealt with this before? Thank you ladies for your time and for reading my post.
