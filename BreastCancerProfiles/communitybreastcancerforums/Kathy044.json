[Thanks for posting the url btw, did I mention that I like reading studies?] There is nothing in this study to suggest that what your onc and BC said is not true about your own prognosis with stage 1 cancer and small tumour size with the treatments you have been receiving.  In this case the women in the study were treated between 1992 and 2005 and followed to 2006. The treatment the younger women age 35 and under with stage 1 cancer received during these years was apples and oranges to what you are receiving, only 22% of the women with a tumour size 1\u201310 mm had chemotherapy for example. [see quote from study copied at end of message]. Guidelines didn't suggest that younger women, because of their age, would benefit from chemo until 1998 even though their older post menopause, ER+ node negative with stage 1 cancer and small tumours can and could do without chemo  and still have a very very good prognosis, yes even better than your prognosis.  I was age 65 at diagnosis and last December spent two weeks reading the studies to decide whether or not I wanted or needed chemotherapy after it was suggested. Despite my initial thought that after surgery I had a good prognosis with a stage 2 cancer and with only one positive node and being post menopause and strongly ER+  and that there was little advantage to doing chemo in addition to  the five years of hormone therapy suggested, I at the end swung around and decided to do it. One of the reasons was that I read the sister study to this Swedish study that compared the prognosis of older women over age 70 women with early stage cancers to their younger middle aged sisters age 50 to 69. Guess what -- these older women didn't do as well as the middle agers either - one reason being that during the study time period these women were less likely to be offered chemotherapy (and still are today). Not that these older women with early stage cancers still didn't have a good prognosis btw, they did, just not as good as the middle agers.  I know that in my case I will get very little additional benefit with chemotherapy over doing 5 years of hormone therapy alone, (most studies show younger women get more of a  benefit from chemo because older women with slower growing cancers have cancer cells that divide at a slower rate and so are less likely to be killed off by the cancer drugs, but the numbers in the studies still show, even these earlier studies before the introduction of the newer 3rd generation chemo drugs, that the addition of chemo still does help some. [quote from Swedish research study article yasminv1 mentioned above] \"The young women should - according to the 1998 St Gallen guidelines [24]  - have received chemotherapy, but only 22% of the women <35 years with stage I disease with tumour size 1\u201310 mm and 39% with tumour size 11\u201320 mm did so. The start of our study period several years before the publication of the guidelines might explain the low frequency of chemotherapy. Consequently, there is room for further intensification of the treatment given to all women\"",

PM me if you have any particular questions about effects of blocking estrogen on those well past menopause. Most women here are concerned about hair growth post chemo which is quite different from hair loss due to endocrine therapy. I was a daily reader here five years ago when I started chemotherapy then moved on to the Hormone therapy threads. To answer your Q. In my experience indirectly lower estrogen can effect teeth because of dry mouth especially if mouth is open while sleeping. I have not noticed any effect of dryness on fingernails & toenails but do have dry eyes and cataracts. I believe the effect of low estrogen on hair is not direct in that low estrogen = a higher influence by testosterone and it is testosterone that drives male pattern baldness. At least that has been my understanding from my reading. Hair loss was one of the reasons I stopped taking anastrozole at four years out. Kathy ",

I was questioned during the scan about some things they saw on my upper leg and ankle. I'd fallen 8 months before and badly bruised the bone and had had a hematoma. That seemed to make them very happy. Also I'd broken that ankle years before and probably had arthritis. Kathy",

Based on previous evidence I decided on my own to extend the interval between mammograms to 3 years once I was age 60 ( and well past menopause). My breast cancer was found on a routine screening mammogram when I was 65. I was part of one of the original breast screening studies done in the mid 1980's to see if the addition of mammography with regular clinical exams saved lives. I was in the 40 to 49 age group and was randomized to the mammogram with professional manual exam  group. It was with great surprise when the initial findings were published that mammography did NOT make any difference in the 40 to 49 age group. Only later, after 15 years of followup, did a non significant but favourable trend in the mammography group become apparent. beepbeep these screening recommendations apply to women who do not have any apparent breast problems. The recommendations do not apply to women with palpable lumps or any other high risk of getting BC. As for having biopsies of every single palpable lump found, (possibly over several decades), the amount of resulting scarring might hide non palpable cancers from view on screening  mammograms. My 1.6 cm cancer found by mammogram was non palpable.",

Cast seemed to be heavy, arm was very painful for the first few days. I wasn't certain what was normal swelling and what might be LE but as up to that time I didn't associate pain with LE assumed pain was from the swelling within the cast from the break. The base of my thumb was a little puffy but that was all. I was told to come back in if my fingers started to turn blue from the cast, nothing about swelling. I was referred to an orthopedic clinic for followup to see if I needed surgery. I didn't. The new X rays showed additional damage to the ulna? bone too and I was told that it can take some days for a fracture to show up on an X ray and I was wondering if that was a reason for some of the confusion in your case. Two weeks after getting the plaster cast the cast the cast was quite loose so I required a new one.  [will edit to continue later, trick r treaters starting to arrive at door]",

When I got the new cast I was offered what they called a 'wet' cast, this would cost extra as it wasn't covered under gov't insurance, but the cast could get wet, you could shower, heck you could even go swimming if you wanted. It was made of fiberglass, including the lining next to the skin which is why it could only be used after the swelling was down. It was like a mesh and water could run right through it. I don't know if it could be used with active LE though as it it is harder than the other and so has a hard edge. I could not have survived living alone with the plaster cast trying to keep it clean and dry. BTW I did not shower with the first cast though I did cover the cast with a kitchen garbage bag and attempt to shampoo my hair in the sink. ( I couldn't shower for the more than three weeks with a drain after lumpectomy either so knew that could be done, but six week? When I mentioned before about the first cast feeling heavy it was when I changed casts that I discovered that most of that sudden six pounds that I gained must have been lymph fluid because the lighter Fiberglas cast wasn't much different.  The second cast came off at close to six weeks after the fracture and I was told all was fine and that I would not require physiotherapy. Within hours my arm and hand flared up with rebound LE. I had never experienced anything like this before and it was painful. I went to my pcp and she arranged for physio, I asked for someone local as I knew I wouldn't be able to drive with that arm to the next city where I had been to see an LE therapist before and besides I needed to see someone as soon as possible, so I took who I could get. I should mention here that Kira who is one of the authoritive members on this forum about LE broke her wrist a year or two before I did. I remembered some of the things she wrote about her experience, including patiently going through rehabilitation with a therapist who did not fully understand LE.  I took that to heart, healing the wrist came first and I would worry about the LE later. Not that Kira was not under the care of an LE therapist also at this time and able to do mld and to wrap but at stage 0 I wasn't and still am not quite there yet. Anyway my physio was familiar with mastectomy patients and knew about LE but hadn't had any training in MLD so she did not attempt it, but she did use several other methods to try to lessen the swelling and to move the lymph and they worked enough to take away the horrible pain so I was comfortable about that and she was very good at what I was really there for which was to work on the wrist to help it to continue to heal and to  get as close to the original range of motion as possible. I had therapy for four weeks starting at three days a week then later two days. She said that the healing was taking longer than it otherwise would  because of the Lymphedema which made sense to me.  As I believe I mentioned once before on the forum, six months after breaking my right wrist I broke the other one, this one on the non LE side. This time it was much different, less pain, less swelling, less physio required, so I can really understand what the effect the LE must have had the first time.  Spookie if you have any questions at all perhaps Binney could pass them on to Kira if no one reading here has an answer.  She did I think have to wrap her fingers with the cast.

I was hoping that because I am post menopause and age 65 and strongly ER+  I could skip chemo, instead the oncologist is suggesting 6 cycles of FEC-D (FEC x 3, Docetaxel x 3) but then suggesting that if the side effects of the stronger first cycle of the Docetaxel are too much they would return to the FEC for the remainder. I wonder what the benefit is for doing the Docetaxel in the first place? Must do some research. joyceva I note with interest that you are doing FEC-D also.  Back to doing my research.

I was offered radiation to the regional nodes last year but after careful consideration refused it. I knew about the ongoing study in Ontario and I asked my RO if there was any indication at that time how the results were going. No such luck. I sort of gulped when I did find out last month, but looking back it think it'll be ok. The idea that I might avoid radiation to the regional nodes was one of the reasons I accepted chemo. I only had one positive node out of fifteen taken.",

My case is different than yours of course. I did not have neo adjuvant chemo. I knew that I had at least one positive node by fnb before surgery (1.5 cm) and so knew that I would need to have axillary dissection. As it turned out out of 15 nodes removed that was the only one positive. It is so good to know exactly how things stand, better than an oncotype test, which I did not have, IMO. I was age 65 at dx, I could care less about a local recurrence, with cancer in the nodes it was distant recurrence that I was worried about. I have absolutely no regrets. I chose to have a lumpectomy + rads over mastectomy. Rads can increase risk of Lymphedema, but then so can mastectomy. Will you be having radiation of the axillary area after mastectomy? That might relay some of your concern. it's complicated isn't it? Kathy",

      "Content": "May 26, 2014 01:09PM - edited May 26, 2014 01:10PM by Kathy044 My thoughts Sydney are the same as above, any additional problems with lymphedema due to the break are not likely to be long lasting . The removal of nodes is a permanent risk of LE, a broken wrist is temporary. I broke my right wrist a year and a half ago, cancer side, right handed, 15 nodes removed with some evidence of compromise to LD drainage system as per LD therapist so I was worried too. It all turned out OK in the end. Kira had written about her own experience earlier and that really helped me to place my concerns on getting the wrist fixed first and dealing with any LD problems later. Thank you Kira.  I wore a cast for just over five weeks and I do believe the swelling from the trauma of the break lasted a little longer than it would have without compromised lymph drainage at least from what I understood to be normal by Dr Google. I did keep my arm elevated as much possible and put my arm in a sling when I went out and that must have helped as the swelling and discolouration didn't move onto my hand area. I got complimented for that from the cast tech. I also slept with my arm up on a pillow but that's how I sleep anyway (or try too) on my LE side. I even did the Lebed DVD the last two weeks with the cast. When the cast came off I did develop full blown rebound LE hand and full arm within a few hours and it was painful. I went to my  family doctor the next day and she arranged for me to have physio for the wrist and swelling. I knew there was nobody close by trained to do mld but I took what was offered and the physio did recognize and understand enough about LE  to know the importance of getting the swelling down to facilitate healing. Meanwhile I learned the LE therapist I had been seeing had retired so that wouldn't have have worked out anyway. By the time I got around to seeing the other LE therapist, same clinic, two months later everything looked fine, of course, measurements hadn't changed any, except for the wrist which was likely from the break not any LE swelling. Let us know how things are working out Sydney, and thanks for starting the topic. Kathy",

I had one drain, it was positioned under my arm at the bottom of the incision where the nodes were taken, so it didn't get in the way too much. It was inconvenient not being able to shower for sure, especially considering mine kept draining for a bit over three weeks. I had a seroma on the breast where I had lumpectomy so that might have been the reason.",

Lets count our blessing when we can. In  my case, when they did the ALND they took out the 'topmost' node in level II separately then scooped out the fat containing the nodes below it. I had 15 nodes taken overall. I assume if the 'topmost' node had looked like it contained cancer they would have removed nodes from the level III area as well, but it didn't.  BTW the new findings only apply to a subgroup of women, those with small tumour sizes and those with no clinical evidence of node involvement before surgery.
