No news yet.  They told me 3-5 business days, so I'll be patient.  It's only been two days ... maybe tomorrow...",

One thing is, you will have an opportunity to discuss this with the technician running th scan. They'll want to know where the abnormality is so the can target it.",

Lumps, bumps, pain and any other abnormalities in the breast are reason for concern and it's scary and frustrating while your here in the waiting room wondering what the heck you might be dealing with. I've read some manuscripts pertaining to MRI for diagnosing IBC and the only thing I've seen directly related to your case is that there can at times be edema at the chest wall, so I think that they should be able to pick it up with what they've ordered. That said, remember this is a rare disease and the chances are in our favor that this isn't what either of us have going on (I have an MRI on Monday to r/o IBC, so I'm right there with ya!). I try to stay positive the best I can, but, admittedly I have my anxieties to deal with, especially as it gets nearer to the time when I should have some answers. When I am able to keep the anxieties at bay, I think about how I'd handle the worse case scenario, simply because if there is cancer then it is already there and I want to have already put some thought into what I would need to do in my personal and professional life. This helps me because it makes me feel a bit more in control. Your silver lining, should you have a dark cloud looming, is that they would be picking up the IBC exceptionally early and that would be a very good thing. Of course, I am certainly hoping for a nice B9 report for you and, again, the odds for that are in your favor. I don't know if this helps. I at least hope I haven't added to your anxieties. This kind of thinking is helpful for me and keeps me sane. I hope the best for you and hope you can enjoy what's left of the weekend. Try to do something fun and relaxing. I'll be thinking of you. Please let us know how everything turns out for you. :)",

Was it at least an open MRI? I can't speak too intelligently about what contrast does but base on the chemical properties do the dye used (iodine or gallidium), it is absorbed by some tissues and enables them tone seen more clearly. I hope you get your results soon. I still haven't heard anything about my test, making me think that it isn't IBC. I wish I knew for certain of course, but I'm thinking that in this case, no news is good news!",

It does clearly show a bulge at the chest wall.  Do you recall anything that could have caused an injury to your chest muscles?  I'm glad you are doing the additional imaging, as there is obviously something going on here and it is best to identify what it is.  Again, though, the highest probability is that it is something benign, but even with that, I'd want to know what it is, especially if it is giving me discomfort.  Did your doc order the scan with and without gadolinium contrast?  Among other things, the contrast will make inflammation easier to see, which I'm sure they would investigate further, if necessary.  One thing more - have you seen a breast specialist?  This is another option, should you feel uncomfortable with the diagnosis.  The advantage of a breast specialist is that they are looking at breasts all of the time and have seen so many ways disease can present. ",
