    "Content": "TyroneShulaces77 wrote: Hi there! I had my first meeting with my Medical Oncologist today, and he gave me two chemo options to choose from. I'm 41 years old, stage 2A, I've had a lumpectomy and my lymph nodes were clear. Grade 3, ER+ PR+ HER2-. I am struggling with this decision obviously. Option #1 is Adriamycin/Cytoxan every 2 weeks X4 followed by Taxol every 2 weeks X4. Option #2 is Taxotere/Cytoxan every 3 weeks X4. My initial thought was option #2, but now I am super freaked out about potential permanent hair loss from the Taxotere. How on earth am I supposed to make this decision? Any advice is much appreciated, thank you!!
