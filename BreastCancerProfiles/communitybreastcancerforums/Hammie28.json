This is my first post, but I've been reading along since I was diagnosed back in October (which by the way, is by far the absolute worst month to be diagnosed with BC). I am 37 years old and scans initially found a 5+cm tumor in my right breast. PET scan confirmed that my nodes were positive. I completed 8 rounds of chemo (AC + T) and just had a right mastectomy with ALND last week. During chemo there was some concern that the main tumor did not appear to be shrinking based on the clinical exams. After round 6, an MRI showed that the nodes were clear and that the tumor showed treatment response but it could not be accurately measured. So I completed chemo. After my surgery the BS said the nodes appeared clear. But my pathology report came back with 7/15 nodes positive and the main tumor measured 8cm! I'm really thrown for a loop by this news! Radiation and Hormone Therapy have always been part of the treatment plan so I know they are next. But I also know a poor response to chemo doesn't do my prognosis any favors. I see the BS on Wed to go over the path report in detail. Any advice or input is appreciated. Thank you!",

I went for a mammogram on my non-cancerous breast. A benign, fluid filled cysts appears to have reduced in size. They recommended that I have it aspirated which I agreed to. But then the doctors revised that recommendation and I ended up with a core biopsy yesterday. I'm not terribly concerned about this cyst... I've had countless mammograms, MRI's and two PETS's while that cysts has been there. But I am rattled a bit by the experience of waiting on a pathology report. And also my liver enzymes are elevated. They were high during chemo and I got a full liver workup which was clear. This was a check to make sure that it had resolved now that I've been done with chemo for a while and they were higher than they have ever been! Repeated the labs. Still high. So now I will get a liver scan and a bone scan. I just keep telling myself... I had a clean PET in May! And finally in survivorship news... I saw a onco-cardiologist who explained my risk of heart damage due to adriamycin. I'll be having a stress test and annual echo's to monitor. All of which I appreciate. She explained that the heart damage shows up immediately for some but for others it can appear over the course of 10-20 years. I am at a really good NCI hospital where they are incredibly thorough. I appreciate the no stone left unturned approach but it definitely causes a great deal of anxiety! Mom: Would you PM me the article link that you deleted? I'd like to read it. I'm not sure that I saw an RCB on my post surgical path but I will check! Also I see that the oophorectomy conversation is still ongoing. I can't say again how happy I was with the decision to get rid of mine. My doctor also explained that they are learning that a lot of ovarian cancers are actually tubal cancers. So my tubes were removed in addition to my ovaries which further reduces my risk of ovarian cancer and gets rid of the estrogen. I would add that to the list of benefits of the surgery over OS. I just couldn't live fretting over every cramp wondering if it was cancer. ",

After living through a mastectomy this really was a breeze. Everyone talks about the gas that they use to pump up your belly for the surgery causing transferred shoulder pain. I didn't really have that at all. I was uncomfortable for a few days but really it was an easy thing to get over. I did about 4 months of Zolodex shots while I was recovering from the mastectomy and going through radiation. And having to go back to the infusion center to get the injection was just an emotional link to my cancer that I wanted behind me. I didn't want to live in one-month intervals.

It was incredibly discouraging to have gone through chemo only to find out that it didn't help all that much. I am by nature an overachiever and it was hard to admit that I was just a C- chemo patient! I wanted the gold star... but oh well! One of the hardest parts for me is feeling like I'm not doing enough post-chemo to prevent a recurrence. I know that the hormone therapy is important, but it just feels like I should do more given the poor chemo response. I do take comfort in knowing that I had 8 clear nodes above the 7 positive ones. But what about any cells that may have been in my blood stream? If the chemo didn't do a great job of stopping the cells we knew about, I can't imagine that it did a good job on any others that we didn't know about. It is weird, in some ways I wish they would go ahead and think of me as Stage IV and just keep doing treatment instead of me sitting around and waiting on it to come back. Does anyone else feel that way? Mom... I started hormonal therapy right after the mastectomy. So I did ovarian suppression and the AI during radiation. Once I was done with radiation, I had my ovaries removed. I'd be curious to know why they think you should wait until after rads are done. \"I already got three opinions from reputable oncologists on Chicago, and they all didn't recommend more chemo (I specifically asked about Xeloda/Create-X) study, and they said they would only consider that if I were triple negative.\" ^^^ that is exactly what my MO said when I asked about Xeloda. I do feel better knowing you are hearing the same thing. BUT I'm planning to ask about the PALLAS trial when I see my MO in December. I'm being treated at the only NCI center in my state, but the trial is not offered there. It looks like it is offered at a regional hospital a good distance away from me. I wonder how that will work? Also I know that the stage IV ladies stay on the drug as long as it is working... but I wonder what the regimen is for earlier stages?   ",

I had ovaries and tubes (be sure to have your surgeon discuss removing tubes as well) removed. I am happy with my decision and wanted it done as soon as possible. I did Zolodex for OS for four months and I didn't not notice a difference in the symptoms between medical and surgical menopause. The recovery went smoothly and I'm happy not to have to return to the cancer center for a shot each month. I didn't have any issues with insurance approving the surgery. So I had an appointment with the \"survivorship clinic\" on Friday. I met with a nurse practitioner who basically reviewed all of the treatment I had received and talked with me about how I was doing. She recommended that I begin seeing a cardiology for a post-chemo assessment because I received Adriamycin. She also recommended that I see an endocrinologist because my baseline DEXA scan showed osteopenia. I was really happy with both of these suggestions. I have been thinking that I should push to see a cardiologist, but had not even considered that I needed a specialist monitoring my bone health. She also told me that it might be a bit of overkill but that I should probably go ahead and have a colonoscopy. At this point, I figure I am such a statistical anomaly why not go ahead and have a colonoscopy in my 30's! Sounds like a blast. Welcome to survivorship! Oh! and I asked her about the PALLAS study and she researched it a bit and sent me a message after the appointment explaining that I amy not be eligible because I have already been on AI for more than six months. She gave me a number to call to discuss enrollment and I'm going to call tomorrow! Finally... she ran through a list of symptoms and I confessed that I've been having headaches all summer. She told me that her job is to listen and if I'm having headaches that warrants checking out, so I'll be having a head MRI soon as well. I'm not particularly worried about the headaches, I think it is just stress... but I will be happy to check them out. I also see my surgeon next week. The appointment is a follow-up for the mastectomy but I am hoping to get my reconstruction surgery scheduled for early next year. I hope everyone is having an enjoyable weekend.

But I opted for the ALND because they had been positive at the start. After surgery, the surgeon commented that they looked clear, but pathology came back with 7/15 positive. I take all of that to mean that chemo significantly reduced the cancer in my nodes even if it didn't get it all. And I'm really glad I went ahead and asked for the ALND.",

I had a lot of tumor left and positive nodes after chemo. My tumor did show some response but not what we had hoped for. Everything that ever showed up on a scan was removed with my surgery... but it just seemed improbable to me that there were no stray cells.... somewhere; waiting to pop up. I'm still praying that this \"concerning\" lesion is something other than cancer but that seems improbable as well. I hope that one day drugs that are reserved for MBC can be considered for women like us. (I looked into PALLAS, but learned about it too long after my diagnosis date). Its strange in some ways I already thought of myself as StageIV... because I was so certain that the cancer was still there somewhere and as soon as treatment ended it would show up again. I had hoped to have a bit more time before dealing with cancer again. Its been only two years since my diagnosis. First year was spent in treatment. Second year has been spent on reconstruction. I have (had?) one final revision surgery scheduled in two weeks that would have been my FINAL surgery and I was so looking forward to being DONE with all of this.",

I've had multiple tests over the last 18 months to rule out mets. (liver and gall bladder ultra sound, liver MRI, PET, CAT, bone scan, and another ultrasound) They all were clear and in the end, I am told that I have \"fatty liver\" disease that likely predates my cancer. During all of the scans, I read about fatty liver but didn't think that could apply to me since I'm not obese. I convinced myself so many times that it must be the worst; but there is a relatively harmless explanation. I will hope for the same for you. Hang in there!",
