Though I feel a lot better physically, I am still really blue.  It seems hard to get out of bed and to find meaning in my life.  I just don't seem to care as much about anything anymore.  Is anyone else experiencing this? ",

Please know that you will be in my thoughts.  I am sorry to hear that you are having such a rough time.  None of this is fair.",
