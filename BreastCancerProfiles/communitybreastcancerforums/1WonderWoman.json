CKPTRY: for having been an oncology nurse at MSK in NYC.  You also deserve this for making it through this past week in anticipating a potential problem with budget cuts at your child's school and for being a super chemosabe at the same time ;)  I am glad it seems to have worked out for you and, for the record, I think you need a permanent cape for the work that you did at MSK...you were doing God's work.

CKPTRY: for having been an oncology nurse at MSK in NYC.  You also deserve this for making it through this past week in anticipating a potential problem with budget cuts at your child's school and for being a super chemosabe at the same time ;)  I am glad it seems to have worked out for you and, for the record, I think you need a permanent cape for the work that you did at MSK...you were doing God's work.

CKPTRY: for having been an oncology nurse at MSK in NYC.  You also deserve this for making it through this past week in anticipating a potential problem with budget cuts at your child's school and for being a super chemosabe at the same time ;)  I am glad it seems to have worked out for you and, for the record, I think you need a permanent cape for the work that you did at MSK...you were doing God's work.

CKPTRY: for having been an oncology nurse at MSK in NYC.  You also deserve this for making it through this past week in anticipating a potential problem with budget cuts at your child's school and for being a super chemosabe at the same time ;)  I am glad it seems to have worked out for you and, for the record, I think you need a permanent cape for the work that you did at MSK...you were doing God's work.

CKPTRY: for having been an oncology nurse at MSK in NYC.  You also deserve this for making it through this past week in anticipating a potential problem with budget cuts at your child's school and for being a super chemosabe at the same time ;)  I am glad it seems to have worked out for you and, for the record, I think you need a permanent cape for the work that you did at MSK...you were doing God's work.

CKPTRY: for having been an oncology nurse at MSK in NYC.  You also deserve this for making it through this past week in anticipating a potential problem with budget cuts at your child's school and for being a super chemosabe at the same time ;)  I am glad it seems to have worked out for you and, for the record, I think you need a permanent cape for the work that you did at MSK...you were doing God's work.

CKPTRY: for having been an oncology nurse at MSK in NYC.  You also deserve this for making it through this past week in anticipating a potential problem with budget cuts at your child's school and for being a super chemosabe at the same time ;)  I am glad it seems to have worked out for you and, for the record, I think you need a permanent cape for the work that you did at MSK...you were doing God's work.
