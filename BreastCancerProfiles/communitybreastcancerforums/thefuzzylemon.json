    "Content": "thefuzzylemon wrote: So, after this Lat Dorsi Flap procedure (if that's what it's called - where they take the muscle from my mid back and bring it to the front) what happens next?  Please tell me there is more to this because I am so unhappy with the way this looks.  My surgery was on November 30, 2012.  I see my PS tomorrow late afternoon.  I'd like to go in there with more knowledge. Can they do fat injections to fill it out?  Should I have the other breast corrected to sit as high as the reconstructed side?  Are there any options that anyone is aware of? I would take any and all information on this as I am having a difficult time finding any answers. Thanks oodles!
