Maria - snacking...whoa.  Well, before my diagnosis in November, and before I decided to get into shape in June, I was a horrible snacker!!  I lost 10 of the inital pounds by adding a 30 minute walk to my day and following Dr Oz's YOU on a Diet.  I didnt use the recipes, but I did use the philosphy and did a lot of what he suggested for snacking.  My snacks are primarily fruit, nuts or whole grain english muffins, breads, etc with peanut butter or an egg, yogurts with berries.  His book has ideas for nighttime snacks....usually if I am dying at night, I make my black bean and corn salsa and have it alone, on spinach or with whole grain, natural chips.  I also like cheese and would have 1-2 oz with some grapes of Gouda or Edam http://healthybodydaily.com/dr-oz-cancer/dr-oz-gouda-cheese-can-reduce-cancer-risk-three-secret-weapons-to-prevent-cancer But to be honest, once I got through the inital 6 weeks, I was basically eating a yogurt with blueberries for morning snack, and an apple with a handful of almonds (with the skins) for afternoon snack and foregoing the evening snack altogether.  I have since been really turned off to sweets...I dont eat cookies, cakes and the like - but I do like dark chocolate and indulge in ice cream from our local dairry farm (but rarely).  I had to change how I looked at foods...its funny how some really turn me off now. Hey I found an all natural iced green tea with mango...and of course now I see someone threw away the can - but its made with green tea, mango juice, cane sugar, and ginsing I think.  3 servings in one can.  The can was tall and black and the tea was super yummy and 60 calories a serving.  I can do that! And today I braved the saturday zumba class!  I LOVED IT!  It was all abs today and it felt great.  I did finally tell my instructors wife (kind of co-instructor) about my surgery and she was great about it.  Just how I like it - \"well, it stinks but its done and you can start healing and moving forward now\"...yes I can!  Party tonight at my house - DH invited friends over and he never does that so I am putting on a happy face!  The house is CLEAN and looks great!  I hope I can make it past my usual 10pm bedtime however!!!  LOL ",

Today is exercise day off for me except for dog walking.  Ive been doing 100 little projects all day long which is a great relief.  Part spring cleaning, part pre-planning, part catch up, part organizing. Maria - I totally hear you on the olives.  It really took me sitting in Naples for me to put a darn green olive in my mouth!!!  I was so surprised what FRESH ones taste like!!!  Mmmmmm.  I figured you knew about the chicken too...its amazing whats on packages!  I still make my chili with beer....the alcohol cooks off, right?  :) Redsky - good to take it easy.  I was soooo fatigued for about 8 weeks and even after that I didnt have endurance at all.  Now that I have been back to Zumba I can FEEL myself getting stronger.  It just takes time. Melanie - thanks for the recipe.  I have been cooking a lot with Black Beans since last summer so this is another one to try for sure!  Im sorry about your arm...what is Axillary Web Syndrome?  I havent heard of that.  I have 'nerve damage' so Im told as my under arm and radiating down I have this dull ache (sometimes not so dull)  when I sit still. It used to be so bad I would have to leave the room for a different chair and put my arm over my head for an hour since pain meds did nothing.  But now I can tell its definitely improving....its been a week since Ive had to massage it but even right now I can feel the dull sensation....it just isnt flaring as much. I mentioned dinner is the mexican lasagne....and thanks to me bringing it up, we are having Toasties tomorrow night with soup.  Im contemplating trying a curried butternut squash soup for the first time.  I think chili might be too heavy.  Ive been over-doing it on my tortilla soup lately too.  Hmmmm.....maybe a cream of broccoli?  I know everyone will end up wanting cambells tomato...LOL!!!  Kids! Enjoy your night!!! Its movie night here and we are introducing the kids to the Back to the Future Trilogy....just part one tonight to see if they like it.  I also picked up Mrs Doubtfire because the scene where her boobs are on fire and she put them out with pot lids reminds me that I will not have feeling in my 'projections' and always joke \"if they were on fire, I wouldnt know it\".  LOL",

Barbara - I am SOOO glad the chicken worked out for you!!  Its so easy and cost effective to roast your own.  And it really isnt much effort once you know how.  I try to do some kind of roast every Sunday from Fall to Spring.  It doesnt take much leftover meat to make a southwestern soup or chowder either. Just a thought. Melanie - SO sorry about your arm but I am really glad they caught it early enough that it may work out.  Ill be thinking of you.  And I LOVE Chick-Fila!!!  When I went on my initial diet, the Doctor Oz diet, the grilled chick-fila sandwich was the only 'fast food' item that wasnt totally poo-poo'ed.  And at a whopping 30 grams of protein, I was eating at least one or two a week while trying to heal my incision because I was trying to get to 100g a day.  Anniemom - so your PS doesnt overfill?  Sounds like he is going with a larger implant that what youre filled at currently.  Glad your fills are done!!!  Thats awesome.  We talked about the exchange a little today - he said my TE looks great and I probably wont need much pocket work at ALL during the exchange.  And he plans to do a Star Flap for the nipple which was a new one on me...I thought he would do a skate. Rennsus - DARN that incision, girl!!!!  I know it stinks to sit still....BELIEVE me I know!!!  But we have to get that healed!!!  Ill thinking of you. Maria - Yes, you are a cute thing...I popped over to take a peek at your pic....messy hair and all. We do BFD (breakfast for dinner) a lot around here.  The British like baked beans with their breakfast (in the tomato based sauce - not the Boston molassas style) so we adopted that.    I usually do a lightly sauteed tomato and mushrooms with ours.....Im so Irish.  Im not a big sausage and bacon fan but the kids still are. Im off to Zumba Toning.  I changed my fill times so I can make Tuesday Zumba again.  I was missing it every other week.  I just have to figure out what to do with my boob...and foob.  Im so lopsided now.  Tonight Im hosting book club so Ill be spending the rest of the afternoon cleaning and setting up for that!!  Have a great day!",

Barbara - enjoy your weekend!  I would LOVE to be going out of town!!! Renna - SO great to see your picture finally!!!  Ill get you that recipe later on.  Its a little project to make but once you know a couple of tricks, its easy.  Your beauty day sounds FANTASTIC!!  Im a little jealous!  My BFF wants to do a spa day soon but with us not working, Im a little afraid of spending any money....and she likes to go to a pricey place! Maria - good luck at the water park!!! I can totally understand what youre saying!  We bought amusement park passes for the summer and they have a waterpark section.  I SO want the exchange to be done so I can go swimming!!! As for the bras, a lot of women on another thread love the Danskin sport bras...they have a zip front one too.  I got one yesterday because my other ones (also danskin) were rubbing on my TE (the underwire).  Remember I HAVE to wear a bra because I need to now 'fluff' my natural girl to match.  I only wear one when my clothing would make my MX obvious - like Zumba or a very warm day.  The good news is that my TEs arent totally in a weird shape - or in my arm pit yet.  Because they are flat on top, I dont fully fill the front of a cup but the Danskin ones have a thin foam to keep shape and hide nipple projection (if ya got em) so those bras look great on. Anniemom - yeah that last chemo is coming.  I think you have the right idea to lay low.  I imagine it will be a poignant moment for you and I know I dont know how I would feel about closing that chapter.  I am trying to plan a girls weekend with BFF for after exchange...and another weekend with DH (We've never been away alone since our honeymoon).  I cant wait to start moving on!  The hospital isnt all men....just military.  The Surgery Clinic really is all airmen (men and women) who just get my vitals and stick me in the room.  There is ONE tech who knows how to set up the fills for the doc but no one is in the room when PS does fills.  One nurse from Colonoscopy came by one day to observe but probably because its facinating....I havent seen her since.   As for Bras - see what I wrote to Maria, but go on Walmart.com and look at the Danskins. Very comfortable (except the underwire ones)...and give the TEs a much better shape.  Ive also heard good things about coobie bras.  You can google them. Oh and Anniemom - I forgot to mention that I did the Dr Oz YOU on a Diet program....I picked it up at the library.  I didnt use the recipes, but followed breakfast/lunch and snack plans and the exercise program  I found that the 'when' was as important as the 'what' you ate....and why certain foods reduced belly fat or make the weight come off...it was interesting stuff.  I lost 9 pounds really quickly....paused a but, and dropped another 6...but that second drop was all exercise and fat to muscle as I wasnt watching my food anymore....I went size 8 to 4 and havent gained any back. ",

But that was the longest Ive ever done.  20 miles really isnt much - especially if youre going leisurely.  You could do it in 2 hours with a couple of little breaks.  I hope to ride on Sunday too!  Maybe Ill get some gear for Mothers Day??  ;-) Well, my interview went pretty well.  I cant imagine Im not qualified and I made a really good case for myself, so I think at this point, is if they 'like' me?  I think there werent seeing 10 people so we'll see what happens.  I really want this one.  But if other jobs with the library open, at least my resume will be kept on file for a while.  I think their concern would be if I move to another library in the county thats closer to home (its 30 minutes away from me and they mentioned my 'drive' twice.) Tonight was fish tacos....I liked it, DD liked it....hard to win over the men.  DH liked them enough, but DS moaned and moaned.  I think next time it will be shell fish and not swimming fish in the tacos - so son wont moan so much!!!  Have a great weekend!",

Melanie that book is a super easy read....you should try again.  I have to admit that I never tried a recipe in there.  But having the structure of the snacking did it for me.  I went with a yogurt and berries in the morning snack and an apple and nuts in the afternoon and quit fried foods, soda and alcohol for a while and did the 30 minute walk....I dropped weight like that....and then added the zumba and biking to get the toning.  It feels great and wasnt hard at all.  Simple exchanges like using avocado instead of mayo on my burgers.....and less coffee...easy stuff. Maria - sorry about the rash!!! yes, keep us updated.  Good luck to DH on the interview!!!  and well, yes I am WEARING a C cup....but thats because a B is uncomfy.  I measure a B still....But they cut into me pretty quickly.... A C gives me a little room to be freer.  I dont fill it on the MX side because, well, of the shape and I have no nipple projection.  But its much more comfy.  I hope to be a C but at 415, well, a B will have to BE right now. What did I read on another thread, you lose about 50ccs with the implant?  So if I get another 80 and exchange, Ill be a little bigger than now at the end.  ok, I can handle that.  I just cant put any weight on or theyll disappear. No real news today.  I wish I got out to bike but spent the day cleaning the house!!! I hope either nephew  or my DH comes home soon because I am TIRED!!!!!  For dinner....easy peasy....bought a package of butterball turkey breast tenderloins and grilled them with salt and mesquite pepper and then we had those with assorted toppings (avocado, cranberry sauce, L&T, honey mustard, etc) on WW buns.  Wow I liked this even better than grilled chicken breasts.  We also had early corn and cole slaw.  Got to start making my own slaw but thats OK.  Everyone was happy with dinner.  Tomorrow depending on weather will be shrimp on the barbie over spinach salads or baked shrimp scampi. Have a great night!!!",

Maria - because we are military, I have VERY little say in the scheduling of things.  If they want their docs to move, they move.  If they dont grant them OR time, thats it.  My PS seems to be doing what he can but he is not getting my hopes up.  3 weeks from Tuesday is a week before he leaves for Texas.  My choice then is do it and have no PS for any complications, wait for the new PS (another month wait) or fly to TX and have my current PS do it (but again another month wait while he moves).  The life of a military wife is like this.....we take what we get and have no right to complain. Barbara - so I am thinking I MAY go to TX to have my PS do the nipple....but unfortunately its San Antonio not Dallas.  I have been to Dallas on business before...my only visit to TX.  and as for Boob greed....well I am SO DONE with THAT!!!! This fill is killer and even my DH said \"I dont think you want to be any BIGGER than that DO YOU???\"  LOL Maybe is is getting boob anxiety!!! Red - I often found that if I slept in the same position too long and then moved, I would get horrible pain.  So I think youre OK.  And are you going through a military hospital?  The bonus is its all 100% covered...but I am at the mercy of the way they do things. New photos on the photo forum....I took a couple of the new size.  I still have to do clothed ones but will do so tomorrow. See what you think!  I think I am big enough!!! I hope I am - I dont want any more fills!!!!",

I had lunch with the neighborhood gals today.  I hadnt seen them in 3-4 weeks.  I literally had to tell my BFF to stop looking at my chest.  I could just see her peeking every now and again!  I finally said' Please stop looking at my boob - its embarrasing!!!  LOL - I also told her that it will NOT look like this in size nor shape in 2 weeks!  They all said I am looking good and cant tell that I am fluffing one side (sweethearts) and then proceeded to razz me because my facebook picture looks like I am sticking my chest out and showing them off!!!  Ah its so nice to have friends. Maria while I may be bigger than you now, the boob greed has been put to bed.  PS overfilled me to 550 so I would have extra room to work with but I am not getting a 550 implant....maybe a 450?  It depends on what the other side looks like augmented.  And whats up with that rash?  I would start to demand an answer or get referred to someone who WILL know.  UGH Barbara - WOW I totally undestand what youre saying....I need to pamper me too!!!  I have been trying to plan a girls weekend with my BFF (My mom is gone and well, I dont really have that kind of relationship with my sisters) but we will have to wait until the dust settles.  I asked her today if she would go with me to San Antonio to get my nipple done and she liked that idea.  Strangest conversation EVER to ask your friend if she wants to go get a nipple with you!!!!! Shannon where are you having your muscle spasms?  Have you tried eating a banana right after exercising?  I had that problem when I started a new routine.  It could be low potassium. Patti - take it easy...It IS hard to tell when youre at the threshold of overdoing it.  Listen to your body though...really. Red - how did the massage go?  I hate nerve damage.  I am getting to hate the words!!! Anniemom - at least you have a date now!  You can set your sights on it!!! Yeah I get it about going back to work but it will take your mind off of things and help you return to a sense of normalcy.  At least that is what I am hoping for!!! My BFF wants me to NOT jobhunt so I can be around to play...but I keep telling her that I need the mental stimulation as much as the rest.  Friday the 10th is my PREOP!!! Melanie - THERE you are!  Sorry about the hand...I hope it was more of a response to the heat.  Seems like you were able to take care of it rather quickly.  And yes, I DO have my date!  WOO HOO!  But unless I fly to San Anotnio, I dont think my PS will do my nipple before he moves.  I will have to see what this next PS will do before I decide. Tomorrow is supposed to be SO HOT that they have already called for an early dismissal at my son's school (only 1/2 of the building has climate control)...so I am going to help with the 5th grade farewell earlier than planned and then take him home at noon.  FINALLY Saturday I will be Zumbaing!!!",

Where did it go????  I helped at sons school all day today so didnt get out to exercise.  Ill walk the dog in a little bit here and then tomorrow is Zumba.  Its been a while since Ive ridden and I am getting anxious about that.  I know in a week and 1/2 I am back to restrictions!!!!  And back on my protein shakes! Barbara - I SWEAR I will not accuse you of boob greed!!!  I have to stop looking at my TE. In the next week I will want it bigger, or smaller, or lower or SOMEthing....I just have to trust that I liked the other side at 350 and will be going with that...if I dont stop, the greed will come back! I know with the way its sitting it looks so much more 'out there' than the implant will be so looks strangely huge on me.  In the end, I am just hoping for a full B and a small C would be nice.  (bigger than I was, but not looking like I had an augmentation except to people who have known me)  On another thread is a lady who has the same measurements as me and with her 450 implants, measures a 32DD!!!  Acutally I measured myself today and assuming my fluff is the same size, that is what I measure to....I laughed but I also know that THIS is not the 'final answer'  So go on with your bad self and get the rack you always wanted! Maria - and go on with YOUR bad self to the gym there!  I am sure you look WAY hotter than some of the young ones there.  I looked around Zumba one day and said \"shoot I may be 44 and have a little mommy pouch in front but DANG I look good compared so SOME of these ladies!!!  I just wish my face match!  Ah a topic for another plastic surgery (kidding)!!! Awww shucks thanks for wanting to write to that hiring manager...thats sweet!!! Youre awesome!  And I DID change my profile pick to a Yellow Diamond Sign that says \"under construction - check back soon\".....only a handful of people will really get that one...but I thought it was so funny!!! Shannon at my lowest energy days, I still try to at least walk the dog and then go around the block again more briskly.  Even housework can keep your energy up...stick with it, I still have those days too. OH!  and Red - I kept the bathing suit!!!  I mentioned its a halter top tankini style.  It looked really nice 2 fills ago but the TE looks rediculous now.  I tried it on for DH and he said the suit looked ok (although does he HATE the 'how do I look' questions!) and when prodded a little further and begging for a real answer (playing the 'how much it cost' card) he said that it looked good enough on me NOW that I should keep the suit and expect it will look better when the exchange is done....so I thought at the very least that I will need a couple of styles of suit for various reasons...so I kept it. I am hoping by the end of July I am able to go in the water AND have a little drop and fluff.",

Im prepping for surgery food-wise too.  I didnt ask for meal delivery this time.  I set up my DH with 2 weeks of easy meals though (lean organic burgers, marinated chicken, sauces etc all in the freezer)...thank goodness its grill season!  The kids will be in camp that first week. Maria - YEAH on harnassing the boobs!!!  Id love to rock a bikini top but alas my Irish heritage makes me rather fair skinned and those belly stretch marks really show.  I wouldnt worry about 450's being a DD.  Im at 550 and I am ASSUMING that I am fluffing leftie approriately and measure the 32D (I miskeyed two D's).  On another thread, Firedancer is the same size as me and got 450's and she measures a 32DD because of the WIDTH of the implants fitting into an underwire....but she says she looks like a nice small C.  I am thinking finding 32DD bras would be a hard task!  Its funny that I would just go to the store and look for the smallest bra they had (sadly!) Rennasus - boring and repetitive updates are good!!!  Thats what I felt like for some time.  Im glad its stopped for now and hope its still dry!!! Anyway, hope you all have a great day....",

My 550 TE is on the picture forum.  Last photos before exhange.  WIth the exception of the sleeping issues and arm pain, I am adjusting to this size.  That has GOT to be the biggest downfall of overfilling the TE.  Im going to be sad to see the implants smaller!  Although with one natural girl, I hope I can remember from where I came!!!",

Boy this is easier than the first time!  Its still rough but things like lifting my coffee cup, pulling up my pants and opening my protein shake bottles are much easier!!!  Thats because my right side (my dominant side) didnt have as much done to it this time.  I cant push the button to open the recliner though which is comical.  I texted my husband up in bed last night at 11pm to come down and open the recliner for me!!!  I was up every few hours last night but not uncomfortable at all.  I just have to try to remember to stand straight.  Its easy to hunch. Shannon - I have about 80% reach on the right and about 70 on the left I would say.  I will have no trouble washing my hair or even braiding it if I want.  I could reach for a glass in the cupboard last night!  So while the arm isnt behind my head, Im well on my way. Im not going to TRY to stretch at all until PS clears me though!!! Red - I have to wear the bra for 2 weeks and then can change to another sports bra if I want.  Its actually not bad.  Its a velcro front sports-bra-looking thing....and its very snug but I like it.  I feel all tucked in. Its just a little itchy in spots.  I am taking vicodin every 6 hours just like after MX.  I WOULD need the meds for sure.  PS doesnt want me on Motrin or anything over the counter for at least 4-5 days. Last time I was the hero and stopped pain meds during the day in 2 days and overnight at 5 days.  I think taking the vicodin for 5 days will make me sit still better and not feel like going for a run (or Zumba) like last time.  Lets promote the healing!  Im glad your PT is helping...phew. And dont you love hearing how skinny with no chest cushion we have?  LOL!!!  I dont mind the skinny but I was always sensitive about my little chest. Maria - I hope the job thing is resolved.  Look at all of the possibilities now!!! Hey and if you got Boston, I would get to see you because I grew up there and we are back there twice a year!  In fact I will get to meet another BC.org friend up there this summer!  So I vote Boston!  It is amazing how similar our journeys are.  I think youre all right that the DH's just dont know how to deal with things after a while and break down a little.  My poor DH had his mom on the brain too.  He questioned me talking to my friend so much about things once and I said \"Look, If I want to talk about the pain in my boob for the 15th time in a week, my friend will listen every single time....do YOU want to hear it that much?\"  He said \"oh\" and walked away. LOL.   I hope all of our S.O.'s come to understand the need of support from them, our friends, our BC friends and our neighbors.  It takes a village (but ultimately, it IS rather lonely....youre right Maria - but we need to keep reaching out!)",

Did I ever tell you my stupid TE trick?  I showed my husband how I could balance my water cup on it one night.  I said \"look, its a coaster!\"  And this was while standing!! ANYWAY - that was your comedy for the day. Barbara- Go for the spikey do!!! I love it!  There are so many short cute hair dos that I could never get.  My head is too big or something.  LOL. And youre right - its no wonder all women dont get boob jobs after seeing some of the TV shows out there!!! YIKES! Julie- we were at Hickam from mid- 2003- end -2006...about 3 1/2 years.  Great place to visit - wouldnt want to live there!  Give me seasons and places to explore!!!  I am already missing our overseas lifestyle quite a bit.  I feel like things came to a screeching halt since we've been back - but then, 4 months after we got off the plane I had that fatefull mammogram!! Melanie - sounds like youre really happy this week....good for you!!! I am so glad you got out to exercise too....even when we are exhausted or dont feel as strong as usual, exercise seems to make me feel like I was DOING something which is important for me. Renn - Photos UP!!!  And I had the same issues with my step daughter...she is better now that she is older but yeah the fights I got into when he wouldnt do the parenting when we had her.  UGH.  She just got engaged by the way which means I will be a MIL (and maybe a young granny???)...LOL DH is a little older than I am, BTW.

Ugh....that was a hard choice.  The other job sounded exciting...but someday I could have it still.",

Im just in from saying goodbye to a friend.  We were stationed together in MA years ago and our children are the same age and gender.  Our sons met and got along so well - so we went for breakfast to let them say farewell because they leave today.  Not sad because in the military we tend to see people again but it was sad in a way.  We got closer here than in MA.

So my MX side's swelling is completely down now.  I have the dreaded ripples.  I also have cold breast syndrome.  Yeah.  I cant wait until the wnter now if its this cold now at just around 75 degrees outside.  My MX side is decidedly looking like a hamburger bun but it IS soft and squishy.  The left is still high and tight....and sensitive.  I may have to take new photos tomorrow....I see PS on Tuesday.",

I had my LAST appointment with my PS this morning!!!!     It was kinda sad.  He is SO happy with the exchange.  He said it doesnt get any better than I got it.  Then he suggested I put next to my photos \"Not a typical patient....actual results may vary\".  That made me feel good.  He was really happy I had my photos out there to show others my journey because it could give women hope, but at the same time it might raise some expectations.  We talked about all of the typical questions and then he made a referral to another doc out of house for the nipple in case the next doc I am uncomfortable with. So to answer those burning questions: Bra or no bra, my choice but dont buy anything expensive for 2 more months.  He said keep them supported in the day but the night is up to me and no wires yet.  I can swim!  I can start exercising slowly but no Zumba or biking if it strains the pecs.  No hot tub for a long time.  No need to Massage. Shannon- glad I could help with my little anecdote!  And I would go to the gym or bike or something one day a week.  Wear a large Tshirt so you feel less self-conscious.  I think the adrenaline will be better for you.  It will boost your mood! Melanie - yes the photo forum is that site I was saying.  Message Whippetmom, Timtam, Lilah, MBJ (I forget who else)....any one of those and say I referred you.  Youve been out here long enough that you dont need my referral anyway.  There are sections for rads, recons, and even hair.  Because I am a UNI and have a mammary fold incision on one side, I am not allowed wired bras.  I found some D's without wires at Khols....Lily of France.  I also have a Chantelle wirefree in a D.  But youre right, not easy to find!!! Maria - I want a super cute dress in the worst possible way!!!

Im back having more crap issues with BFF.  I could very easily walk away from her 'push' if she didnt come right back with such strong 'pull'.  I have decided that she needs to be on the do not call AND do not answer lists.  Her husband went for an interview for a job in DC and youve never seen me want someone to take a job out of state more than this time.  I just hate what that would do to our daughters. Ok dont want to leave on that note....so everyone have a fantastic weekend and Ill be on tomorrow to let you know how baseball goes and if I bump into that WONDERFUL friend of mine!",

I stopped using extra pillows in only 2 weeks....and probably sooner that I woke up and found them kicked to the floor. Renn - I DO know how to fluff it well.  But I never wore a prosthetic.  I never did have to deal with a bathing suit either.  I would go with that if you want to wear a suit or especially since you dont have to change sizes.  What I did was take a padded bra (they come pretty thickly padded!) in my size and cut the cups off and used it for a breast form...they are the perfect size and shape and you can get them on the clearance racks.  When I got to the point where that wasnt enough, I was able to get an additional form at the fabric store and used that for a little more boost.  My size had to change every other week though so it was always fun trying to keep up with the changes! Shannon - ugh I hope the Torture Enhancer (TE) is a little better today.  How was circuit?",

Well, today we are going to a waterpark with the girls.  My DH does NOT want to go.  He was up 1/2 the night with allergies so he will be a peach going to a place he doesnt like on a day that its a zillion degrees. My challenge for the day is to make sure I dont go on any extreme waterslides or anything like that - this will be the first time for me in water since exchange.  PS (I almost wrote DPS LOL!!!) said I can swim but not all day long so Ill be going in, cooling off and standing waist high most of the day.  Ill try to only do the 'rides' on a tube so Im not crashing into the water.  I bet we stay no more than 3 hours either....its 'dangerously' hot here.  People arent used to it and there have been deaths. So for Shannon - my left side dropping...a little more description.  If you look at the profile of my photos, my breasts stick out a little like a cone.  If I took a photo now, my left side is starting to drop a little beyond the IMF....I cant hold a pencil yet, but its starting to look a little more like a real boob.  Does that make sense?  The fold is higher than the breast now.

Maria and Red - yeah vacations!  Im happy for you both to get a llittle break from things.  Red - 2 and 1/2 weeks out of surgery is where I was when we went to Boston.  I walked a TON but I didnt go into the water or go boating, I took pics from the shore.  I was just not comfortable with the pec muscles yet and even gentle arm movements in the water are felt - even a month and 1/2 out.  While your vacation will be wonderful - still stay within your boundaries right now! Im 7 weeks post exchange today.  I was going to wait until September, when the kids are back to school, to go for my nordies fitting....but I think I want to shoot for next week now.  I'll be 2 months out.  Looking at other photos, I can see my medial space is really still little.  I can 'push' my right implant out a little, but my point is, when I am sleeping in my sports bra (a compression style - the FOTL one) it is NOT helping keeping them apart.  When I sleep without, the space is much better defined.  So I need bras that encapsulate the breasts better. I really only have the Lily and the Chantelle right now that do that...the VS ones push in.  The Chantelle I cant really wear in the summer beause of the soft cups (the lack of nipple is OBVIOUS.).  Sleeping without a bra helps the spot that is usually sore in the morning, Anyway, Im not complaining, just letting you all know some of the things to look out for. Today Im headed to the waterpark with my kids and my neighbor and her daughter.  Just for a few hours.  DH is off golfing.  Have a great day!!!",

What about a recumbant stationary bike?  I would start with that and power walking (try not to move your arms much - keep them tight to you).  After your legs feel better you might try a light jog or walking with small weights.  I would NOT lift or try to swim yet.  Its still early days.  Swimming aggravates me 2 months after exchange. But first and foremost talk to your PS and be honest about what you WANT to do instead of asking what you CAN do.  For example if he says you can go to the gym, he may not be thinking that youre planning on running the track, weight lifting and swimming.....he might be thinking youre doing leg machines or the stationary bike....so be specific. ",

We would have serious complications if we tried to compete with them breast wise.  Our frames couldnt handle it.  I may be a DD - but if I had a 38 inch ribcage, they would be only an A so maybe the women you see really are DD's themselves?  And that thin lady with the big ones?  Well, I think she probably hates them and feels like they are in the way!  Now don't you get all obsessed watching boobs in your classes!!!  I watch mine when I am in the mirror (are they moving ok?  Do they look 'right'?) and then I see myself watching some of the young ones because mine look more like those than the ones my age! And youre right - DH loves them - I feel like I look SO much better in clothes, and I do NOT want to run the risk of losing the implant or having complications after yet another surgery!  Red reminded me that some women have revisions down the road - and the implants will need to be changed in 10 years anyway - so if I want a new size then, I can do that.  BTW, caught DH talking to them today....I laughed at him and bent down so he could talk to my face.  I guess my top is low cut today!",

I am helpless with 'fish that swim' at home so if I cook with fish, its ALWAYS shellfish.....I dont know why I have horrible fish skills!

Weather is another one....it was great to have the surgery in the winter because there is no where to go...but now I am more mobile and want to get going! I am feeling tight in the thighs today from Zumba but Ill be going again today.  My right shoulder is stiff a little too but nothing bad.  Ive had a weird thing going on with my arm...like a dull numbness?  I had it since surgery but until about 2 or 3 weeks ago was able to fix it by elevation and movement...and it was only like for 30 minutes of the whole day.  I moved my computer from the recliner in the basement to my leather chair in our 'lounge' and the pain was getting worse.  Today I am NOT sitting in that chair to see if that is, in fact, the culprit.  I have to definitely keep an eye on that one.  At least I noticed it was the position I was in on that chair (and laptop). Have a great day!",

My veggie lasagne came out great last night and no one bawked about the lack of meat!  I just layer spinach and zuccini in leiu of beef or sausage....home made sauce, and the best cheeses I can find.  Thanks girls, I think we are all each others best therapists.  I wish we could meet for coffee, tea, exercise or even a 'beverage' sometimes!!!  Cheers!",

Toss to coat.  Arrange in a single layer. 4. Broil 3-4 minutes until opaque throughout.  Sprinkle with lemon juice, toss to combine.  Serve Immediately. Now, in step number 4, I tossed with a package of quinoa pasta, a cup of peas (cooked with the pasta), and two chopped vine ripe tomatoes.  Thats why I added the extra oil and garlic. It is GONE.....I did miss the butter a lot but I liked the quinoa pasta substitution.  I think it might need a little more seasoning perhaps?  Not so much hot though.

Melanie Im a little jealous about the 10K.  I never really could run.  I am sure I mentioned that my BFF wants to do the Air Force Marathon (1/2) this year but when I run for 20 minutes I get shin splints after a week.  Its so frustrating to me!!! Maria unemployment is bad here too.  A lot of big companies recently left here.  The Air Force base is a big employer but jobs in my category are scarce.   And as for your BFF .....YEAH she is coming!!! Id love to go on vacation with mine....we are planning a celebratory girls weekend for when my surgeries are all done.  But I think a family trip would be awesome too.  Our daughters are BFF's too and our sons, though 2.5 years apart get along great.   And the cooking blog sounds great too. Turkey burgers?  I tried once.  I am a total burger addict though....this is a hard one for me.  I could totally give up beef if it werent for burgers.  I DO buy lean, organic, hormone free angus ground beef though so if I have to have it, at least I do the best I can....then I top them with spinach, tomato, avocado, red onion, and a touch of natual ketchup....on a WW bun.  I bought an all natural face scrub and shampoo today....two more changes.  And I found a website for you: http://www.natural-living-for-women.com/  It can give some ideas if your stuck finding natural alternatives to things.  Ok, off my butt....and onto other things!  Have a great day!!!",

Anniemom - ahh, nothing feels as good as clean hair.  Enjoy it!!! Since I already talked about my exercise today - on to dinner.  I usually do this Sunday but today since its raining, we are having a whole roasted hormone free chicken with garlic and herbs only - no extra oils and heaven forbid we eat the skin...ick.  Butternut squash for a side (LOADS of Vitamin A) and of course my spinach salad which I cannot seem to do without.  I like roasting the whole bird because I use the other 1/2 for more healthful lunches.  Cold cuts are SO bad for the kids so I tend to prepare a much larger roast than I need and use the leftovers for lunchboxes, soups (especially the tortilla soup), or second meals.  One of my kids favorite things is a 'toastie'.  I take the leftover chicken, lay it on a WW flatbread, top with some english cheddar, and toast quickly in the oven, then top with avocado, lettuce, tomato and sometimes sour cream and veggies of their choice (since they are different that way)...roll and go.  Quick and easy dinner when served with some veggie chili or tomato soup.

OK the lasagne thing...to be honest, its not mine.  But someone brought it to us when I was laid up....its a Rachel Ray recipe and the meat can change to your liking: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rachael-ray/mexican-lasagna-recipe/index.html So there, I fessed up.  LOL.  Actually I change the medium heat taco sauce to tomato sauce because of my kids....so that part is mine!!! Tonight was BBQ chicken.  Did you know chicken injected with hormones is illegal in the US so its only important to get hormone free on your beef???  But you still want grass fed/antibiotic free on all of your meat.    http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12803309/ns/business-consumer_news/ With our chicken were roasted yellow squash and zucchini and a salad of tomato, mozzerella, basil, EVOO and S&P.  YUM! Maria you talked about not liking Olives.  Do you dip your bread in EVOO?  You may find you can develop a taste for green olives if you get imported Italian ones.  I was SHOCKED to find the flavor difference...and I am an olive fan now.  But 2 years ago you couldnt have put one near me.  I get them stuffed with garlic here in the states because they are a little briney.  I actually bought some today and thought of you!  As for motivation....I think we are all good for each other out here.  I love to come on and share my daily news and progress!!  You girls are GREAT!!!!",

Over the hump now.  You can do it!  Im so proud of all of you gals! Maria- the exercises you mentioned sound a lot like my Toning class.  I just got in from it.  I upped my weights to 2 pounds (which doesnt sound like a lot until about 30 minutes into the class).  I was fine but I couldnt get the weight completely over my head without a tight pinch in the TE area.  Perhaps Im sutured in because thats what its feeling like!!!  All of the other movements were OK.  Im trying to find another activity as I think I will drop wednesday Zumba.  There is a class called \"women on weights\" but I am afraid to try it with the arms/pecs right now. If youve given up Mayo purely because of the oil, you can find it made with OO.  I dont use Mayo anymore - Ive changed it out with avocado, but occasionally have some with tuna salad. Tonights dinner is my own concoction - we call it CBZ here which is short for Chicken, Broccoli and Ziti.  Its much like the marsala recipe except I use lots of garlic and white wine.  I used to add milk to thicken it but Im pullng back on that and going back to the way I started making it years ago.  That with salad is whats for dinner! Have a great evening!!! ",

Min - always go with what your PS and your body tells you.  We have found out here that different PS's have different rules. I cant run but Melanie did a 10K recently...But after my toning class today, my pec was definitely telling me to stop! Barbara - youre right about the hummus - our local market has several varieties - including a very unappetizing looking edamame hummus!  Your frittata sounds wonderful - Ive been meaning to try that sometime.  Speaking of which  - time to make dinner and get my son to scouts!!!",

I have to start being careful. I got a little boost today too....DH caught up to me and said \"Did you notice those guys that just passed?\"  I said \"no, not really\"....he said \"They were checking you OUT!!!\"  WHAT????? I didnt think that happened anymore!  Little shot in the ego is always nice. Well, that does it for me.  Im going to assume that this fill is going to make me want to NOT do Zumba....maybe if it warms up again like they said it will, Ill be ready for a ride on Thursday or Friday...but Zumba KILLED me the 3 or 4 times after my last fill.

Rennasus did you get out on that hike? I did NOT make it until my nephew arrived.  He got in well after midnight (he drove across a time zone and forgot so he was an hour later than he thought he would be) - and then in turn slept late.  I woke up and it was already 65 degrees and sunny and due to get to 85 yesterday so I went on a very quick ride - only 12 or 13 miles.  I tried to stay over 15mph the whole ride so I was trying to work on my spinning and not distance.  I wasnt that successful but did OK I guess. I need more practice before I go on a longer ride with my friend. Today was opening day of baseball so I was at the park EARLY with my son.  It was great however that my BFF's son played on the same field as my son but the game before - So I got a nice visit with my girlfriend today....much to my DH's dismay as the two of us whispered away.  Then right after our daughters (also BFFs) had their band competition so I was at that this afternoon....and came home and made a blueberry crumble for a dinner we are going to at our friends' house.  This WHOLE week was like this....even last night I brought the kids to see a movie and I passed out when the lights went down...I was OUT for 1/2 of the movie.  Boy am I running this week!!!  Tomorrow we are going to a Reds/Cardinals game.  My husband REEEEAAAALLLY wants to see this game for some strange reason (we are Redsox fans - so I dunno) so that will be our whole day.  Then its back to the races for next week.  Hope I get to Zumba NEXT week!!! Maria - how did your class go????  Tell us!!! Have a good one!",

That was a little rant.  I was just hoping that we were moving on from that lifestyle. ANYWAY - Maria its normal for some people to pry....I hate it but there it is.  If I dont say anything, EVERYONE has assumed its my shoulder. I tell people I cant lift or stretch and they assume shoulder....thats OK with me!  It means my TE and fluffy boob are matching and looking natural!!!  Im really glad your class went well though!! Thats great news.  And I love the simpler meals....I always prefer something grilled over a salad over too fancy - but I give into BOTH on regular basis!! Barbara  - I like the sound of YOUR diet!!! LOL....Honestly I need to put on a few 'good' pounds but I dont really know how to accomplish that...now that everything in the high calorie category really turns me off!   Good luck with the chemo this week....are you close to done now?  Seems like all of you beautiful women are finishing up at the same time.  :-))) Today I got in a long walk with pooch.  The week is looking COLD here.  I think I will get in Zumba on Tuesday and maybe a ride late in the week....and I definitely need to do Saturday Zumba!!!  Ive baked today - I made Irish Soda Bread (with WW flour - a little strange but OK) and a blueberry crumble for dessert.  I know I made it for our friends dinner last night but it was SOOOOO good, I HAD to make it again today!!!  On Sunday when I can I also like to start the week's dinners so Ill do Clam Chowder and make Tomato/Vegetable Sauce for the freezer.

One MORE bit of good news today....the library job I interviewed for?  Well, they chose someone else.  Boo.  HOWEVER they were so impressed that they asked me to be a 'substitute associate\" on reference - at 1 and 1/2 times the salary of the other job I applied for!  This means the work wont be consistant which is a HUGE drag, but the point is, I could work at any of the libraries in the area, I would be IN the system and hopefully the first person they turn to when it comes time for a full time permanant slot.  So I will have to continue my search for a job, but this means I have my foot in the door somewhere!!!!",

Maria - Glad Chicago was awesome and thanks for the hotel tip!  We'll have to get up there soon.  We have been looking for some fun ideas that wont break the bank.  Of course I want to go to Florida but that doesnt exactly fit the 'cheap vacation' plan.  LOL.  Once we have jobs, then we will have the money but wont have the TIME!!!  As for Zumba - I will probably go on Saturday this week.  Today was out and I think I may try to bike a short distance tomorrow.  My kids are in their last two weeks of school and I am helping out nearly every day up there.  That cuts in to exercise time!!! Rehm and Shannon welcome!  Zumba has been great for me because I can isolate certain areas and only use the one arm (I had a Uni) when I was comfortable.  I did it a lot before surgery and my strong legs and abs certainly helped recovery.  The only thing my PS said not to do was run.  I wasnt given stretches either but told to move normally....so I do.  I still reach for things in my cupboards, stretch a lttle in the shower and do my Zumba twice a week.  I also do normal things like keep my arm up and behind my head when I watch TV. ",

Renna - sorry youre feeling sluggish...Did you hear the news about the anti-breast cancer drug that gets higher marks than Tamox?  No side effects and 65% reduction of risk?  They are looking to give it to high risk women before diagnosis...I wonder how long it would take before its common practice?  I would take it for a 65% chance of reduction and no SE's..... So Zumba yesterday was HARD for me.  My arm was very tight and sore.  I tried to avoid shimmies and throwing my arms up. My face was SO RED but I think it was the heat yesterday.  I am going to try Zumba at least twice this week before I am done for the summer.  Id like to bike today before it gets too sunny and hot.  Not to bury the news here but my MIL passed this morning.  My DH mustve gotten a 4am call or something because it was his FB status (he is still asleep) and he didnt wake me to tell me.  So instead of heading out on a ride, I am going to wait until he gets up.  He may want a family ride today.  There will be a memorial service when everyone can (no wake or funeral)...with my surgery next week, I think it will probably be ina couple weeks when I am OK to drive that far. Sigh.  While she was never 'MY' mom, she was a good lady and a good mother in law.",

Rennasus - I read on another thread about your incisions.  Come on....COME ON!!  I feel like a little far away cheerleader.  Almost there!!! And Stay tuned to see how the second round goes with me!  with one incision underneath and one across, I am so curious to see if I have the same issues.  Ill tell you though, I plan on NOT MOVING those first two weeks at all!  No Wii Zumba this time (that was so DUMB)...and if I have to drive.....well, maybe Ill have DH drive me.  I cant have issues this time!!!",

Zumba was great today - my instructor bought me a Zumba shirt to wear during recovery so I would think of them.   Awwwwwwww.....I love them! Oh and I have my secret surprise I want to share...I havent shared with anyone!!!  Ya know how we love to compare our TEs with baseballs, or cannonballs or coconuts etc?  Well, weeks back my friend went to Hawaii and DH joked that she should bring back a coconut bra for me (which I would have NEVER worn when we lived there).....well, I didnt ask her...but I DID buy one at the local party store and stashed it away for when I am completely healed...as a surprise treat for him.  I did something fun for him the last night before MX (he was completely delighted with THAT surprise) and I thought this would be a funny conclusion.  I just remembered today that I had that!!!  LOL",

That must mean Day 5 for me!  Time to wean off the pain meds!  Now comes the hard part.  I resisted the urge to walk last night.  I slept in the recliner again but mainly that was because my stomach was a mess last night.  The pain meds back you up horribly.  I took a prescription constipation med and in an hour was cramping and feeling, well, like you-know-what.  I forgot how poorly those const. meds made me feel last time...and it was why I went of the vicodin so fast. I took my second shower today too....Shannon you have to know that as much as I HATED that TE and was really hurting up to my surgery - I love the new girls.  I think they look just great.  I think I went with the right size for me...I told DH that I dont think I shouldve gone bigger or smaller.  So there is HOPE for you!!! I just KNOW IT!!! Shannon - the kickstand thing is the perfect analogy!!! I had to tuck a pillow under my ribs to keep from putting pressure on my TE.  I was laughing reading that one!  Do you have a recliner or other room you can escape to?  When we bought our house, the 4th bedroom was mandatory for just those occasions!  I hope you report back after your appt this morning!!! Maria - Ummm, YEAH on the visit!!!!  That would be AWESOME!!!  Let me know how plans start to form!  We are less than an hour to Cincy.  And surgery NEXT WEEK!!!  YEEE-HAW!!!  I am so excited for you!  The meal prep I did is really working out nicely right now.  DH is doing great. I feel like I will be back in the saddle sooner than 3 weeks but Im glad I prepared for that.  I think we are leaving for MA in less than 2 weeks so Ill be able to eat a LOT of fish soon! Father's Day - well, we dont have local friends we could BBQ with sadly...I think that is one of the things in life I really wish I had.  My daughter will be in TN on a mission trip (her first time) and I will still be laid up so I bet we'll have a low key day.",

Julie -  I have colace but it wasnt slow for me!!!  I got cramping in an hour and sat writhing on the stool within 2.  Now that I am OFF the vicodin in the day (and soon at night), coffee is my perfect stool softener.  After both surgeries, I didnt mind the constipation for abotu 3 days and then started getting tummy issues.  So Id rather go off the pain meds at that point than deal with tummy troubles.  But maria is right, there are others here that can help with the chemo issues. Maria - I wonder and worry about Adam on Man V Food!!! I dont know how he does it.  Well, he isnt Mr Universe.  Youll have plenty of time for food shows soon!!!  And I agree about the photos.  OMG I think months ago I shared my Onsen story from when we lived in Japan.  My boobs made me so ashamed of myself because it seemed everyone had a comment about my size before that I couldnt go do a traditional onsen with my Japanese friends....even though I know they were all as flat as I was.  Now I feel like flashing everyone!!!  I just hope Im not obnoxious with my clothing choices!! Ill have to revisit the xanax thing....I slept in a bed lat night! YEAH!  It was WORK however!  I took a vicodin before bed, propped my back so I wouldnt roll over and put the corner of another pillow under my ribs so I could be ALMOST on my side...I woke once at about 1:30 and thought about moving but hung on there.  I was thinking that I HAD to get used to the bed because soon I would be in hotels.  I guess my pillows are coming on vacation! Maria I hope your job stress comes to a peaceful conclusion soon.  Having moved because of DH's work 4 times to VERY unknown places, I can totally relate to the waiting and hoping and dreading. Vent away.  For me, school districts have always been number one when considering where to live. Let me know if you need help with how I did research.  And my 2 cents??? since you didnt ask for it!!  ;-)  I ALWAYS voted for adventure.  My kids are so iincredible now having had the experiences they have had.  I would still vote for another adventure assigment if my husband got it....this stable thing isnt working for me!  LOL!!!

Melanie - I always had a love of the library - but I wasnt really allowed to ever want to be a librarian.  I went to a very stuffy college prepatory high school and everyone was going to be a doctor or lawyer (it seemed) so the pressure was on me to pick a good college and career.  I went into Computer Science because it literally was the only other thing I had an affinity for (It was the 80's - big technical boom) and did it for 10 years.  But I am definitely a data person....I am terrible at networks, hardware etc....so now that I can start NEW (now that we are settling here, wont move again and my kids are older), I thought I would follow my heart this time.   I have time to develop and grow here now.  Its part of why I took the entry level position.  I know I am far more qualified for Research Librarian, but I know I have time.    My point is...in my 20's, I did what I HAD to do.....now in my 40's Im going to do what I WANT to do!!! If its something you want to try, GO FOR IT!  No day but today! And Im really quite shocked that you get ASKED if your boobs are real!!!!  OMG!

Annie - Time to take a typing class to maximize your time online then!!!!  We miss seeing you more often but glad you get to check in!!!

Whats going on?\"  No text or call.  And yesterday my DH saw her at the ball field (I had left by then) where she was watching her son's practice and she tells DH that she misses me.  REALLY.  Sorry but now Im aggravated.  If I tell anyone \"Ill call you later.\" or \"call you tomorrow\" or \"Ill call you right back\"....I do precisely that.  But for her any of those means the same thing...Ill call SOMEday but no idea when!  Grrrrrrrr.  I know it sounds petty to be bitching about a phone call but its like an emotional push and pull we have going on.   You all dont need to say anything at all....that was mostly to get it off my chest because my DH is tired of hearing me moan about her. So the good news in all of this is that I have a crazy busy week and then I am on VACATION!!!  Baseball games, appointments, parties, packing until wednesday and then we drive away!  I am so happy to blow this clambake. (Well, thats kind of a New England expression - and it doesnt make sense since I am trying to GET to a clambake)  Since the sun didnt bother me yesterday at all, we are making plans for the beach up in MA/NH  for a couple of days.  YEAH!  I will be on Omega 3 overload....Fish for lunch and dinner every day!!! Whew this post was ME, ME, ME today.  Sorry about that. I hope you all have a GREAT day and are doing well.  Thinking of my sistas out here!!!",

Tomorrow we head south again and I meet up with Firedancer from this site...we are having lunch and then bra shopping!!!  Then I hopefully will finally get to hook up with my friend that I was supposed to meet on Sunday.  Then we leave Friday morning!!  Run, run, run!!!! Shannon- have a WONDERFUL trip!!!!  How awesome!!!  Its so wonderful to get away for a little while isnt it?  We want updates and FB photos! Marie - I second the fruit of the loom snap front bras.  Im wearing mine now.  I wear it to bed to keep things together even though I am free to wear nothing if I want.  I havent found another sports bra that I feel comfortable wearing to bed like this one yet.  I didnt like sitting around either but knew it had to be done.  Take it easy and it will pass faster!!! I dont think I gained much after surgery - and I was pounding the protein.  I think all of the calories go toward the healing. Maria - can your PS suggest someone in Chicago?  They seem to all know each other or at least have knowledge of respected ones.  Im nervous about a new PS for my nipple too.  I love my PS and am so sad to leave him.  And some sisterly advice.  The move WILL make you crazy but you WILL get through it.  Step by step....inch by inch.   Try not to let things overwhelm you and please please dont jeopardize the progress youve made by lifting, moving or hauling too much!!!  Its a great time to delegate as much as you can.  Youve earned it.

As for the nipples - I dunno I guess I was just reading all of the active threads on the topic to see what PS's do....looking the procedures up online (Googling) to see what was involved and then talked to my PS about it - I dunno a couple-3 months ago.  He does the star flap procedure but said any of the flap procedures are good and have great results.  Its nipple and areola at the same time...so I dont go back for tattooing later. This is why I couldve gone to see him in San Antonio since its all at once.  Hey - THATS where we should go....lets get Sue a new nip!  LOL J/K. Red I feed great.  I get arm pain when I am in certain chairs still strangely but its early days and the pain is MOSTLY gone.  My left side gets tired faster than the right and gets achey throughout the day.  I still get little pains when I open drawers or doors.  As for exercise - I was cleared at my 2 week appt to start back slowly but do nothing that involves the pecs too heavily.....he said I could swim and bike but I told him I would still wait a couple more weeks to be safe.  Ive been walking a lot but not too strenuously.  Tonight I walked the dog for the first time. Ive been really taking it easy to this point.  My ride on Monday will be maybe 10 miles to see if I can handle it in my arms.  Id like to swim too for ROM exercise.  I am doing well there but not 100% on the right - my left is better somehow....the BA side. Red - I really do wish we were closer - Id love to ride with you!  We'd be good biking buddies!",

Melanie - YEAH on the 5'Oclock shadow!!!!  AND youre almost done with Rads!!! I am so happy for you!  Shannon - I hope you get a chance to meet Barbara!!!!  Meeting Firedancer was such a blessing.  To sit with someone who knows all of the backstory AND who has been there is amazing.  We couldve talked all day.  We could talk about our ordeals without feeling like we were taking up too much of the others time or complaining or any other feeling I get when I mention anything to my non-BC friends.  And there was no awkwardness of meeting someone for the first time either.  It was strange but wonderful and always memorable!!!  Ooops I just realized I didnt take pix yesterday....my DH mentioned it twice too.  He is really getting to LOVE taking pix.  LOL. We've been having a little too much together time though - Im ready for him to work!  Well, my dermabond on my MX side started cracking a few weeks ago, and last night I took off a small chunk - maybe 1/5 of the whole thing.  If you dont have dermabond, its just like crazy glue  - so you can imagine it trapped any little drops of blood at the time of surgery and sticks like crazy until the your skin starts to regenerate and then it peels right off.  But when it comes off, the skin is moist and red like youve had a bandaid on a wound for a long time, so then I get all worried looking at it like \"is it closed? is it seeping?\" because of last time.  Of course its closed.  The dermabond held for 6 weeks - last time it held for 10 days.  But I am BABYing the area so like a mama, I worry about my girl!  The scar will be minimal when it all comes off I think (hope!) I'm also being very bad today.  My plan all weekend was to bike today because there was a little break in the morning heat (its been getting to 90 by mid morning) but now I just dont feel like it!  I hate biking in humidity and when I have my period...I just feel like doing nothing!!! Also we are having friends staying here from Wed-Fri this week so I know I have to clean house today too.  I'm not going to want to do it tomorrow after work!!!  I feel blah.",

Marie - I'm so glad the pain has improved some.  Youre right - running a mile, or making it through a Yoga class or swimming a lap or walking your dog all goes a very long way emotionally.  It is probably why a lot of us 'do too much' too soon after MX or Exchange.  We are all looking for a little bit of normalcy after a crummy experience.  I did Zumba three times this week (twice on friday) before I realized that my back isnt yet strong enough.  Renn - you'll get your fitting...and I honestly think THAT is the event we all need to be at....to cheer you on!

I try to do Zumba 3 times a week - at least one of those being Toning.  If the weather works in my favor then I do a ride.  Because I was only into a routine of walking and zumba until diagnosis, I havent gotten a REAL new routine since the last surgery.  I will need something to replace biking over the winter.  Id like it to be an upper body strength activity. As for diet - I used to track my intake but stopped with BC - and because of that added MUCHO protein, as you know.  I never counted calories but stay away from fried foods, sodas, and too many sweets (thank HEAVENS for sensitive teeth) and limit alcohol....that plus exercise seems to keep me the way I am. As for nip/revision - by the time my implant will be ready for a changeout, I will have gone through menopause - so maybe Ill have enough belly for replacement parts?  I hope not!!!  But I do hope the technology comes a lot further.  I still have in the back of my head people who's implants fail after a couple of years!  Yikes!  I dont think I would want to be bigger because then it would be even harder for me to find bras that fit (unless I gained weight!) but I should show you what happens when I raise my arms - talk about a party trick! I think THAT could go from my world!",

The bad news is, I didnt get a fill today and have to now wait until the 22nd because he is out next week.  He said it DEFINITELY shows improvement and ALMOST changed his mind but then said that we should really wait.  Im still doing protein intake and cream on the site 3-4 times daily.

Maria - Ill be good, I promise! Tomorrow is my DH's brithday but we are celebrating my sons' with a party at the bowling alley.  My daughter is at a party tonight (sleepover) and tomorrow there is some scouting service work that the guys will get to. Thats our big plan!  I didnt get my DH anything for his birthday yet.  I dont know what to get him really....maybe tonight we can go to another bike shop so I can look further and he can pick out some stuff.  Hmmmmm.",

And to make it even better, my Best Friend came with me too!!! YIPPIE!!!!  My instructor was so happy to see us because to him, we just disappeared...but I told him not to worry and that it would have to happen again soon enough, but we love him and its all good.  LOL We went to the toning class which is less dancing/cardio and more form - crunches, squats, arm movements with weights....that sort of thing.  I did great except for anything where my arms had to be extended behind (like when you try to push shoulder blades together).  My movement is about 100% but I totally feel that last 10% if you know what I mean so I took it easy.  I also would put the right weight down 1/2 way through a song as not to overdo.  I SO want to go tomorrow for the zumba fitness class now!!!  But not sure if BFF can - I was shocked she came today but I know it was to keep an eye on me. She watched me the whole time and asked me if I was OK at every grimace!!! Gosh you gals, Im so proud of you with the chemo.  I can only imagine.  BC enough on the plate - the surgery, the worry but then the followup treatments.  Im so proud of you for staying the course and doing so well. Anniemomofthree - No, no Youtube video today!!! LOL!!!!  For a video for yourself, you can try the zumba website to see what they have and maybe get it cheaper at Amazon.  I wouldnt buy the whole set until you know you like it.  If you have a Wii, I would get the Wii Zumba game.  Its cheaper than the videos and there are levels - and you can do one song, or 20 minutes only or whatever.  I dont have any of the videos but I do have the game.  I just love my class!  All of the teachers are so different too! Barbara - GOOD FOR YOU!  On getting the freezer set up!  I did some chili and some tortilla soup as well as spaghetti sauces for the freezer.  Pot Roast works really well in the freezer too - just the meat though, not the veggies.  If you make a large roast for yourself one night, you can probably freeze two more meals worth.  Ill have to try the swiss steak! Oh and Barbara, thanks for the chemo info but I am the lucky gal here who doesnt need chemo.  I had DCIS and turned down tamoxifen too.  I had a single mx and am working on recon - so Ill be getting the house and myself back in order for another 6 week restriction but probably sometime in June.  My poor family and friends were like, again???  really?  Youre not done yet???  Nope, sorry!!!",

I think I must be wonder woman or something because I keep waiting for the pain Im supposed to have from getting 75ccs....now I wish I got 100!!!  I took preventative tylenol before the fill and then before bedtime but there were hours and hours in there I didnt have any pain killer in my system and I also woke up fine.  I do have my arm pain today so took a little something for that. I was going to do zumba today but alas life got in the way - I had my hair done this morning and DH had the van with the kids - their appointments ran long so I ended up walking home...about 2 1/2 miles...not bad but it cut it too close to zumba so I bagged it.  Ill go Saturday.  Hmm, maybe Ill do a stationary bike at the gym tomorrow to make up for it. Maria - thanks for the stretching reminder.  I bet that would help my arm too.  Good Luck today with the treatments!  Sounds like you do well to be ready at home for your treatments.  As for my TE's - they are 350's but I am pretty sure that's the implant size he is going for so there will surely be overfill.  He is being conservative I think.  He will let me go bigger if I want, but he wont let me go too big for my frame.  Thats good because I may get boob greed and try to go too big....lol....now that I can CHOOSE instead of waiting to see what God gave me in my teens. Redsky - My TE's hurt a lot while my chest adjusted to them.  When I tried rolling over at night I would awaken with sharp pains.  Also reaching for stuff really hurt too.  It took about 6 weeks for me to adjust to that.  Did anyone talk to you about Tamoxifen?  Even with DCIS I had to meet with an Oncologist about taking that.  I refused it, but she said it is a standard course to offer it to DCIS patients. Rennasus - No worries on the incision at all.  He said it looks great.  Although he was surprised that 75ccs didnt bother me a bit.  Ill have to boast that it didnt even hurt later on as expected.  Good luck with your surgery monday.  I am sure it will be fine.  My TE still has a lot of give, especially around the incision. Annie - I was rather bad with desserts for a while.  Im back on track now but man the chocolate craving was the worst!  I had my friend in Europe send a HUGE box of sweets for me.  Well, I HAD to indulge in THAT!!! Melanie - Good for you on the walk/jog!  Its amazing how even something as easy as a walk can boost your mood, metabolism and strength!  Keep up the good work!  The only thing I was told not to do is run.  Darn.  Im being sarcastic!  My friend wants me to do a 1/2 marathon with her this fall and the only way she'll take NO from me is my doctor saying so....so now I have my 'doctors note' on that one!",

Maria we have a huge international market here and I can get a lot of products that are organic and natural without much trouble.  Now that I can read the labels too (after my crash course living overseas), I can pick out good products.  I dont buy my Japanese Rice or Italian Olive Oil anywhere else!  I can also get the European cheeses, butter, etc...even some exotic vegetables we got used to. Red sky- right after my last fill, my sore arm came back.  Im prettty sure that means the TE is sitting on a nerve.  Its OK again today but its been over a week.  I noticed today that the skin and TE softened a LOT which I appreciate, but i am still pinching when I put on a coat or reach above my head like the TE is sutured in.  Oooooow!!!   The TE gets better with time, but I dont notice if its exercise or not thats getting it there.  I just go about my normal routine.  My Zumba class over the past week (3 classes) were all equally hard on the TE side.  Sleeping and daily activity got better after a few days. My next fill is May 10 (another week delay!) and I am going to nail down a size and date if I can.  Im at 335 and intial thoughts were about a 350 impant but I may ask to fill to 400 (65 ccs more) and see how I like that.  I would be happy with a 350 but I think I want to shoot for a little more.",

Currently my TE is twice as big as my natural girl so I have to wear a sports bra every day and 'fluff' my natural girl.  Its easy right now with the Danskin wirefree sports bra (foam cups) and I use an old padded bra cut up as the fluff. It works well now.  I WILL be having an implant put in that side when I decide what size to be.  They will just calculate what they think is the volume of that side currently and reduce the implant size by that....So if they think I have a volume of 200, my implant on Leftie will be 250 and on the right 450.  I dont know if I had mentioned that I was about a phone call away from setting a surgery date for Breast Augmentation when I learned of my DX - so I am continuing with Plan A once Plan B is complete!!!  I cant believe I am admitting all I do on the internet!!!

And I agree on the photos.....we took photos for DH and I NEVER intended to show them - but the forum helped me so much so I thought I would do it.  I still havent shown my TE to my best friend...my husband is FLOORED that I havent done it yet.  Its partly because I worry how she'll take seeing the scar, no nipple and basically the look of the whole thing.  But I want to show her so she will appreciate the final outcome.  I am so hung up on my naked body (at least I was pre BC) because my boobs were so small.  But Ive been through so much now that I feel like the TE is like a badge of HONOR and Im on my way to a couple of trophies! Barbara if youre serious about posting photos, maybe I can talk you through it.  Do you have a Mac or PC?  If you have a PC and right click on your photos, choose \"resize\" and select \"small\", they will be the right size for uploading.  Then when you start your thread, you can see at the bottom a place to browse for your small photos. OK, back on subject - Zumba was awesome today and I was SO glad I went....especially since I will miss Tuesday for a fill.  The teacher was so proud to tell me about the new Toning songs he has but I know I will probably miss quite a few of those coming up!!!  I do have to say that its TOTALLY getting noticable that my TE and Fluff do NOT match.  Im trying to fluff well, but when youre moving around as much as I am in Zumba, the TE side stays put while the fluffy side shifts, crumples and rises up.  UGH...it will only get worse before better.  I better switch to loose Ts for a couple of months!!! DS's baseball game was great too but I am SO sunburned....DANG IT I forgot sunscreen!!!  TOO much to think about!!!",

Blah. Im glad youre still moving....you'll get more energy and stamina.  Youve been through a lot, girl!  You'll get there.  Im proud of you for plugging along and working it.  How did your appointment go?  Ah, another chapter in the novel of life. Maria - No I do NOT think youre being mean at ALL.  But I AM really glad that youre not giving it too much though.  You'll be much healthier for not dwelling on it.  As for vitamins, I was taking a multi vitamin and my protein shakes regularly (and motrin!) but Im within a week of surgery and will back off those until after.  Ok, in the category of converstations you thought you would NEVER have (yes another one of those nipple conversations I recently had).  I had a LONG chat with my BFF about boobs yesterday.  Last week when the neighborhood gals went out to lunch, my neighbor who had the augmentation was there.  BFF said to me afterwards that she thought neighbor shouldve gone bigger.  Me being all uptight still (cancer does that) decided yesterday to bring up that throw-away comment...I said \"So....do you think I should go bigger?  I'd rather you tell ME than gossip about me later to someone else!\" So we talked about boobs.  LOL.  She is a DD and warned me that bras in that size are really hard to find and small shirts (because we are petite otherwise) will pucker in front.  While she always was larger and loves her boob size (she just has ptosis now), its not easy clothing wise.  So there's the boob greed in check.  I think she will come to Zumba today so Ill get to show her my TE before exchange.  My DH is FLOORED that I havent shown her yet.  That will be another surreal experience...I dont normally go lifting my shirt to show my friends my boobs!!!!  Its getting close!  I cant wait for this thing to be gone!  Its SOO uncomfortable!  But I do have to say that its softening some!!

Shannon - I wouldnt exercise today.  I started going to Zumba same day as fills but noticed I was feeling crummier longer....I dont know if it was because the fills were getting tighter or I was exercising too soon, but I gave my body a few days after the fills after that.  The last time I went to Zumba same day, boy I hurt for a couple days!!  My point is, listen to your body! Renn - yep I am totally worried about healing issues...but I stocked up on protein shakes and will start those immediately this time.  So I hope to do the high protein (eggs for breakfast, greek yogurts, my shakes and bars etc. to help with the healing!  Ill let you know how it goes! Maria - I hear ya on the not exercising for a while again.  I was hoping for my 'unveiling' when I go to MA this summer but since its 3 weeks after surgery, it wont be much of an unveiling!!!! And that guy in Zumba has been mercilessly flirting with me for months...and his wife is in the class!  He does it before she arrives and then is all normal once she gets there.  The 'reading the shirt' was over the top though.  Glad the preop went well!!! Well, after ANOTHER uncomfortable sleep, I am SO totally done with this thing.  I wake up ALL achey and rolling over is a challenge again.  My body must be telling me its big enough.  And Bless you all with your 'little girls'....after my total meltdown in April, I sent her away for an extended vacation.  But I dont have to deal with rads, or chemo, or LE or the stuff that some of you are right now. I'm proud of you gals.  Im also here to listen. You guys are wonderful!!!",

Barbara - SO glad you had a wonderful time in FL.  Fantastic.  Cleanse the mind! Melanie - How fantastic you made that connection with the woman at church.  I try to understand that people arent well versed in dealing with things like this and that is what creates the awkward moments and the constant 'how are ya's'  They want to connect but it comes out false.  One day in January - the weekend before my surgery - one of my friends called me to tell my about HER problem.  I was getting call after call with the 'how are ya' and I was SO tired of talking about it.  So this friend had a problem and thought to call ME with it.  I was never so happy to listen!!!  I think I told everyone that story.  I didnt realize how much it bothered me that no one was thinking that I would want to be a part of their lives like that.  Im going to remember that if any of my friends, God forbid, gets sick.  I'm praying you start to have more and more GOOD days!!!  Oh and I wanted to tell you how SMART you are for keeping those notes!!!  That will surely pay off!!! Shannon - ARMS UP!!!  Well, you can...I cant!  I can feel the upper poles of the breasts and I LOVE IT!!!  So soft and snuggly!!!    I can also squish on the bra a bit and tell how soft they are in there.  Im so darn happy!  And my arm doesnt hurt as much as even when I woke up this morning!  I could NOT sleep last night with this arm So here's a little more news from today.  The surgical bra is TIGHT!  I am having trouble breathing while sleeping on my back.  I keep feeling like a little asthma attack.  Nothing major and I have my inhaler right next to me.  The bra is giving great support and it helps with the up and down but its getting itchy!  Another small nusance I dont really mind.  PS says I can shower tomorrow if I want and was REALLY firm about lifting and exercising but I can go on the trip I will take in a few weeks.  I see him in 2 weeks and then in a month. My implants are 350 and 475!  I have my ID card and was able to look them up.  I hope the circumference difference isnt noticable....but he is the expert! The 475 surprised me but I guess that is what matched the best. So with my DH retired and not working yet I can count on him for more this time.  I think I told you I marinated some meats, made some sauce and basically planned out the menu for the next 3 weeks until our trip.  My son is still in baseball season so a lot of the meals are easy things like burgers, grilled chicken sandwiches and turkey kielbasa....so they can get off to the games 3 times a week.  I did NOT clean the house more than usual this past weekend and I did NOT do laundry.  I didnt want to knock myself out before surgery this time.  Let me know if you have questions about the exchange...I cant think off the top of my head what else you might like to know.  Lord knows Ill be sitting here for at least a few days!!!",

Yippie!!! I woke up, took my meds with a Boost, and fell back asleep for 2 hours.  Then I woke up, had breakfast and went BACK to sleep - this time in BED for a little under 2 hours!  WOW  I was SLEEEEEPPPY!!!  The pain in the left is still quite evident but the right is improving quickly. That makes sense.  Im only sensitive on the right around the edges of the pocket.  I think the actual exchange part is fine - but any pocket work or fixes is what hurts...plus I still have no feeling across the front anyway.  My left nipple is totally saying \"HELLO\" though!  Its been sticking out so hard I can see it through the surgical bra and its sensitive (in a naughty, good way)  I hope that stays - a little payback for losing the other one. My nipples never did much for me before, sadly. Maria - LOL no echo!!!  I havent tried flexing either because the bra is so tight I dont think I could.  It hurts to use the right pec to open the recliner.  My kids are like yours in the hating french fries and chicken nuggets.  My son refuses to eat school lunch and my daughter has always been anti-meat.  I have NO pre-made entrees ever in the house and my friends are amazed...but its only a little effort to make your own chicken tenders or lasagne!  Gosh I hope the job thing works itself out soon!!  The library hasnt called me back and im starting to worry I lost the job.  The orientation was supposed to be this coming monday.  :( Melanie - Glad you had a good day!!! You sound like me at that age...and I was working in the Theatre and was down to skivies in front of so many people but I had to shove my insecurity out of my head.  Now I feel like showing people - but I think its more 'scientific' now...the motivation is different. Shannon- Im glad you had a nice night and kept those thoughts at bay.  And you most absolutely deserve beautiful breasts.  Science is wonderful now.  Nice breasts are not the consellation prize now...They are the trophy!  And MUCH better than a pink Tshirt!  I'm glad you two were able to open up too.  My DH came to every appt....every fill.  He doesnt do much or say much but he is really appreciating the process.  He'll be happy when Im all done (he is already getting frisky with me again) Barbara that is so funny - you'll fit right in with your new boobs!!!  I never thought about that but I can see it!  My physique definitely does NOT fit in with the mid-western bodies I am seeing around here so I think Ill stand out a little.  Thats OK too.  LOL  And Maria was knocking - I was itching.  I dont have feeling across the front of my right one, but the bra is itchy everywhere else.  I was scratching and could HEAR it and it was bizarre!! I would freak if I knocked and someone said hello!  Im so glad your swelling is down....such good news! I guess it was a matter of time before sex would come up!!!  We have to be a little careful though - this is still a public forum! Im trying to stay in the chair but I get a little yearning for a walk.  I am used to an evening stroll.  It hasnt gotten too bad yet because the meds keep me a little dizzy!  But Ill be cutting back on the meds soon!!!  Yikes",

Shannon- so glad you are feeling better!!! Yeah!  I wore a danksin sports bra when I had the TE.  Walmart carries them for about 10 bucks.  Alternatively JCpenny and Champion have zip front versions that people talk about too. Well!  First my boobs.  I posted the new photos from this week online and Whippetmom immediately suggested I STOP wearing the surgical bra because it looked like my righty was encroaching on the left's dance space.  I kind of thought the same so I called PS and went in.  He said that things were swollen still but I should stop wearing the surgical bra so they dont get pushed together anymore.  Meanwhile he was completely thrilled with the result.  He is usually so laid back but I thought he was going to give me a hug.  He took pictures too.  LOL.  Basically he said \"No one could get a better result than that!!!' and I said \"Then Im really glad it was ME who got it!!!\"  So I went to VS because they are the only ones who have 32Cs in store and picked up a couple....Ahhhhhhhh. Next - JOB UPDATE!  I called yesterday basically to find out why I hadnt started yet.  Job A was a research associate as a SUBSTITUTE.  I would be on call if someone was sick or had to take leave, but I wouldnt get benefits or be inthe bargaining unit.  But I would love the job and would want to aspire to have that position on a full time basis.  NOW I inquire about the job I lost that I saw posted again....and they said I could have that!!!  BUT  Job B is a clerk position...entry level, lower pay but I get benefits, earn vacation, part of the 'union' and set hours (15 only per week).  Either position would be an \"In\" so I could move up the ladder...but Job A is a better position, but wouldnt know if or when I would be working.  Job B is a lower position but steady.  My head says B my heart says A (and B)....just because no one is working in this house and we could use the steady hours....and with B, I could get tuition reimbursment to finish my Masters and earn job C someday!!!   AUUUUGGGHHH!!!!!  And I said I would call back today!!!! So much to think about.  My brain will explode I am sure!",

Melanie - YEAH on the photo shoot - cant wait to see!  Shannon - I am tight but not too sore from the walking.  We did it again yesterday - this time walkng a few miles through the woods to get to fireworks and a concert.  It was great to see some friends we knew from Belgium and Hawaii!!!

Saw the family yesterday and it was a little like the elephant in the room - no one said a THING about my boobs. My SIL asked if I was finished with the last surgery but that was a sidebar.  My sister either says the wrong thing or nothing so I was glad it was nothing.  Of course my brothers werent saying a thing except 'how ya doin?\"  LOL.  I think they just didnt know what to say!!! Marie - listen to your friends out here.  Its early days and it does get better.  And listen to everything they say about me!  LOL - I had incision problems because I did too much too soon and I paid the price for a few months. Off to NH today!!! I get to see one of my best friends whom Ive known for 20 years...the kind we went on vacations together and sang together - tried and true.  YES!  We are going to the beach today.  DH took pictures yesterday of me in my bathing suit and I did NOT scream, fuss, throw the camera or stomp around like a 2 year old for the first time ever.  Have a great day!!!!",

I got to see BFF today at the ball game.  Her son's game was before ours and in extra innings.  I havent seen her since before exchange.  Actually I think the addage \"Absence make the heart grow fonder\" really is true....it was really nice to see her.  I wore a new shirt that I SWORE I wouldnt wear out of the house because it shows every curve of my new girls - and it has BOSTON across the boobs so unlike before when these kinds of shirts were more like a flat billboard than a neon sign the words really stick out! Im a little insecure still....but with my husband's prodding I kept it on...so EVERYONE at the field got to see the new girls.  LOL.  So Monday is ONE MONTH!!!  Can you believe???  Ill take new photos then and will go for an early morning celebratory bike ride.  BFF is anxious to go to the dairy farm (40 round trip) but Im not sure Im ready for that long yet.  Baby steps!  Zumba I will promise to stay away until August....but my bike is whispering my name every time I go into the garage!!!  I should be OK for a 10 miler. How's everyone doing?  Or is it just the weekend? Maria - We'll see you in chicago....we've never been and Id love to go.  Its only 5 hours....much better than 14!!! Shannon - Bras will come.  I now have to find ones that work for me.  A lot do not in the stores.  I cant wait for a fitting!!  I was giggling over the bras I used to wear at VS....I started making baby noises going \"OMG they are so CUUUUUUTTTEE!!!  Look at that teenie little wittle thing!!!\" LOL!!!",

Red - thanks for the update!  Yeah sorry you got sick but its past you!  You may feel really tired for some days.  I was surprised your surgery was 3 hours.  That could be why youre a little more tired too.  Someone told me that post surgery is a little like jet lag - it takes one day for every hour you were under to snap out of that feeling.  My surgery was about 1 and 1/2 hours but they had given me too much anesthesia so I had a ton of trouble coming out of it.  I was really glad that going into surgery my DPS told me that he would talk to my DH after surgery knowing that I wouldnt remember everything and he was so right!  Stay well, stay napping if you want...heal heal heal! Julie - 2 of 28 is a step forward!!!  Glad you have a cool tech and nurse.  That surely makes a difference....keep up the good work and youll be through to the other side soon! Marie - sorry this is so tough for you.  Youre not alone.  Many of us have had a lot of pain with our TEs or other treatments and certainly can understand.  Only you and your PS can make the right decision as to what is best for you.  Renn has had her TE taken out so knows about that.  There are threads out here somewhere that talk about going with NO recon, DELAYED recon or second or third tries with recon.  DIEP, TRAM, etc are other options for recon as well.   Perhaps the TE route isnt for you.  Perhaps (like with me) the TE is sitting on a nerve.  You have the weekend to formulate your questions for your PS.  Instead of saying 'I'm done I want it out\" - think about how important reconstruction is for you (or not) and communicate this to him and ask if there are other options. There may be another route without scrapping the entire mission!  Good Luck! Well, I am really excited as I get to go to my library today!!!  I think I mentioned that my orientation covered all of my 'contracted hours' for the week but the librarian at my branch offered to me my regular hours in addition as a substitute.  I couldnt work Wednesday but instead picked up today.  So I get to meet everyone and work a few hours to get adjusted.  Im excited!  AND my DS is coming back from camp - I want my baby back!!!  He missed a lot this week as his team won the championship game on Thursday....I have his trophy.  I am REALLY happy this town doesnt do 'participatory trophies' - only for the top 2 teams.  YES.  Now the trophy MEANS something!  But thats a rant for another discussion board!  Have a great day!!!",

Red - 30 minutes is perfect.  You DONT want to do too much now.  Like I said, it will come and it will feel great when youre there.  If you go too fast too soon, it will NOT feel great.  The lady at the library I am sure wore gloves because of the germs on the computers, doors and books.  I cleaned the computers twice this week, but even I feel a little skeeved about the books and what is on them. Zumba was great- dare I say - easy?  I am not sure if it was how much I was personally working it or the class however - I was super conscious about the girls.  There was a LOT of hopping - not much shimmying today.  A lot of hip thrusting and less footwork...I enjoy the footwork because then I add the wiggles and that tightens my obliques quite a bit.  I practically do the whole class with my stomach muscles tightened (posture) and on the balls of my feet....but couldnt really do that with THIS teacher. I DID wear the Lily of France bra.  I cant wait for my Moving Comfort one to come so I can see if its snugger in the cups.  Marcia was bopping around and Jan is even looser in the cup now but the band is still perfect.  At one point I held onto them.....I think I am going to try to go to Keith on Monday night.  I miss him so much now!!!!",

For revisions - my DPS said the same thing. I just hope I dont have to have any right now or within the next couple of years.  I worry about CC.  Im so sad when I read about people who get 6 months or a year out and start having problems.  Ugh!  To think youre 'done'!

Youre lucky youre at least a 34.  You'll have a LOT more options.  Once I get to Nordy's, I can online shop a little more confidently.  It will start costing a lot for shipping and returns if I keep trying on bras willy-nilly!!!",

I didnt wear the band to bed last night.  My right side was SORE on the bike ride and pinching last night all of a sudden.  It has to be the band.  I woke up this morning feeling fine.  Im either wearing it too tightly or its doing more harm than good.I feel like it is pushing my breast OUT on all sides instead of down.",

Red - THANKS!  I wish you could do it too!  Ill get to check out the route for you.  We still plan to try to do the 50....but this week killed any biking so I need to find a way to get in a few more long rides before i feel comfortable going out that far.  We can ALWAYS go out 12 miles to the service station and if its too much, go back slowly - that will still be 25 miles on rolling hills and still an achievement since the grades around here are slight. Maria - Jayden sound like the kind that enjoys almost everything you make.  My DD is like that but DS always finds a problem!  He better be a chef as he so desires because he has the most sensitive palate I have ever seen! Shannon - YEAH STICKS!  Every bit of normalcy helps.  And its great when others notice too!  Go you! Nothing major here today.  Off to part deux of my Wednesday! ",

DPS said 'most of my scar will be used and id have a little scar left on either side when all is done' - looking at the size and thickness of my scar and location...I cannot comprehend how any of that can happen.  As far as I can tell, my nip will be placed ABOVE my scar line. and BS left me with one huge scar. Negative feeling coming from...a) the possible end to my biking season already.  b) the finale on any thoughts of revision although I am making peace with not having a revision - its kinda like how I felt when DH had a vasectomy...the conscious decision to be 'done'. c) another recovery! d) fear of the unknown - how it will look in clothes, will I fit in current bras, what if it warms up again?  Will I like it?  Will it help with symmetry?  Its not really the last step - Ill still need the tattoo in about 3 months....although for me that wont take much doing....I might be better off not getting one.

Yesterday was DH's retirement!!!  Woo hoo!  I spent the morning ironing and getting everyone haircuts and ready to go.  Then cried through the ceremony!!!  For those interested, here's the basic gist - Everyone is presented, the anthem is played, the invocation, the address by the commander, presentation of the Meritorious Service Award, presentation of other awards (including one from President Obama), presentation of commendations to me (I got two!), presentation of DH's shadowbox of his flag and awards (his flag was flown at Fenway Park - he is a huge Red Sox fan), official retirement, a speech from my DH, benediction, and the playing of the Air Force song.  I am still tearing thinking about it.  It was a big day!! And I was absolutely exhausted after it all!!! Maria - Good luck with both PSs!  I hope meeting with your PS on Monday brings satisfaction! Melanie - you can run?  Did I say this before?  Its the only thing I am not allowed to do.  I dont mind at all since I dont run anyway, but I am surprised how different everyone's surgeons are. To all - My GOAL for this weekend is to really focus on food.  I have researched a few 'lighter' versions of favorite recipes I plan to try - one is shrimp scampi!  I will go to our organic market for some meats (Our military store has a lot of organic things but not meat), and work on some dinners for the family that we can all agree on.  Ive gotten further in that Anticancer book and have been talking about it all week with DH.  He is going to lean up and get fit this summer!!!",

It was cooking day for me though.  I make my own tomato sauce for the freezer and it was time.  I chop several varieties of peppers, mushrooms, onions, and zuccini into it reeeeeeally small so the kids dont notice.  So we will have lasagne this week with that and 5 more batches went into the freezer.  I also made clam chowder...not the healthiest dish but I did use organic milk this time....thats for tomorrow night.  Tonight its baked chicken with spinach salad and I am still working on another side. Maybe roasted red potatoes.  Hmm.  Have a great Sunday!",

It was really hard to reach back and get my light off for so long!  I think it was about 8 weeks before I was really feeling like I could be normally active - fully stretching and lifting. Im 5'5 and about 118.  My band is a little smaller - 28.   The TE's are 350's which is the projecteed implant for a full B.  When I get to 350, I will try on implants on my natural side (in a sports bra) to see if I want to go bigger or not.  I want to be a small C as I think any bigger would be too much for my small frame.  I am REALLY hoping to be at 350 the first week of May (I go every other week).  Im starting to feel a little boob greed though now that I am getting used to the 255's!!!  My BFF is a DD and will yell at me as soon as I try to think about going any bigger than planned though.  My neighbor is going for a boob job too (she is about my size but a little thicker in the torso and is starting with natural boobs) and she wants to go for 475 implants...I told her that she is NUTS.  LOL   Anyway Red, there is a thread about \"anyone staying smaller (B)' that is great fun and talks a lot about fills and exchange surgeries. I'm really glad you have someone bringing meals!!!!  I had 1 month of daily delivery which was great and tiresome at the same time.  I still needed delivery afterwards (again with the incisions) but, well, not everyone made things that the family liked.  I hate to sound ungrateful but it started getting harder when the kids wanted second meals prepared.  :( I was bad today - just dog walks...no gym.  It was a beautiful day though!  I hope it holds and we can bike tomorrow.  I was hoping to get to lunch with my BFF but she cant.  Boo.  Better for my legs maybe.  Have a great evening!!!",

Well it mustve been a beautiful Sunday everywhere because everyone is NOT on these boards!!  It was amazing here today!  I think it got to 85ish....After running early errands, the family went on a bikeride for ice cream....the first time the kids have hit the trail.  My DH drove them to the trail (2 miles from home but we werent sure how they would do) and we went 2 miles out to a dairy queen and 2 miles back....then they wanted to try getting home on their own and I was proud of them to do the 2 miles uphillish to our place.  So 6 miles for them....8 for me.  Not a big ride but a nice start and they really enjoyed it.  They asked to do it again....good sign!! I contributed to cancer today and got a sunburn however....I have to get used to sunscreen on the body again!!!  I hear Burts Bees has a natural sunscreen product.  Ill have to look.  I use a LOT. I got out to a real butcher today for some no-hormone, grain fed beef, no hormone chicken and a brat or two....we has grilled burgers (i end up with more veggies on it than meat - LOL), roasted red potato and steamed brocc with garlic.  It was a GREAT tease and back to the 60's and rain tomorrow!!!",

Melanie - so glad you got the pains under control and good for you to continue walking.  I dont really 'miss' running but Id like to give it a serious try.  Runners legs look so nice. Like dancers legs...long and lean. Maria - how did the fill go?  Wow 470!  Nearly double me right now.  How are you feeling about that?  I have this tight LS Tshirt DH bought for me and until today, Ive been breastless in it...one natural flat one and one missing....I havent worn it since fills...today I put it on and said to DH \"how'dya like me NOW?\"  LOL....even at a B I feel sexier. I concur about the soups....so easy to make and freeze 1/2.  Then youre meal ready for another night later.  Just dont try it with cream soups and dont reheat in plastic. Barbara  I am SOOOO glad youre feeling better!!! Thats GREAT!  And a roasted chicken is SUPER easy.  Preheat to 350.  I simply wash and pat dry the bird (make sure you take the pouch out of the inside of the bird that has giblets and stuff).  Some people put oil on the bird to give that skin a little crisp adn browning but I dont anymore.  I sprinkle on S&P, onion powder, rosemary, sometimes thyme or garlic.  Bake for about 20 minutes per pound or until the thermometer in the thigh is 160. THEN you can do the toasties!! I went to Zumba toning today - the instructor changed a couple of songs and it was a GREAT workout.  Im so pleased he changed stuff because it was getting a little easy and predictable.  I feel like I will be feeling this tomorrow!!  I love that. Nothing fancy for dinner....Tuesdays are my slacker days in the kitchen...its pasta night with my homemade veggie sauce and all natural garlic bread. And of course SPINACH!!! Nearly every day!",

Anniemom - sorry about the Europe weight!!!  I can take it back if you want!!!  LOL.  I had book club over last night and one of the gals looked at one of our family portraits (from 4.5 years ago) and said \"You look COMPLETELY different!!!  You lost a LOT of weight!!!\" This was before we moved to Europe so I said - well, I am the same weight now, but just in shape - I never exercised like this before.  I got the feeling I looked better with the little bit of....fat?  Even my BFF is saying im getting too skinny - but its ALL exercise...I really am the same weight I always was (except in europe - darn that Belgian beer!) AND DARN!!! (I actually have stronger words in my brain) the Surgery Clinic just called and moved my next fill one more week away.  The Doc is on leave in 2 weeks.  COME ON!!! I have been so delayed and I was finally catching up.  My initial surgery date was Dec 5th - then Jan 19 - then PS broke his arm and I got a new PS - then surgery on Jan 26 - then my first fill was at 8 weeks after and not 3 weeks after - and now another week delay.  I REALLY wanted my exchange BEFORE June.  ARRRRRGGGHHHHH.....im so frustrated.  Well, there I go planning out my May thinking I would be done with fills by mid-may. Im going to sulk.",

Rennasus - I try to use organic or natural where possible but this is hardly fat free! 2 Chicken Breasts skinned, bones, cut into strips.....OR 4 very thinly sliced chicken breasts if you can find them.  1/4c WW flour.  1/4 tsp basil.  1 cup (I use more like 2) cups sliced mushroom.  1/4 c sliced green onion.  2 tbs butter or EVOO.  1/4c chicken broth.  1/4 marsala cooking wine. If the chicken is thick, pound it thin.  Stir together flour, basil, and some S&P.  Press chicken into flour. Melt butter or heat OO in a large skillet.  Saute the mushrooms and onion until tender - set aside.  Heat more butter or OO and add the chicken until brown on both sides - about 4 minutes. Return mushrooms and onions to pan.  Carefully add marsala and broth....simmer ans stir until you notice it thickening.  Transfer to a plate and spoon sauce over all. Here's a tip with the green onion.  If you ever notice that you buy green onion, use a little and the rest goes to waste, try chopping it all up and freezing it in snack size baggies in 1/4 cup measurements.  Most recipes I use call for green onion in 1/4 or 1/2 measure.  I can go to the freezer and grab a bag or two and use it in any recipe.  I also ALWAYS go to make something and realize I dont have green onion in the house - and there it is waiting for me in the freezer!",

Im getting anxious now that my fills are very close to the goal!!! I was cleared to exercise at 7 weeks but remember I had the incision issue.  I was told before surgery that I could workout (no lifting) at 4 weeks.  The only thing I am not allowed to do is run...but I understand that every PS is different on this too.  Those first few weeks back were ROUGH for me....I felt like I was starting over with Zumba and biking....so weak!  Now I feel back to normal but it took maybe 10 lessons...so about a month.",

Good news - I have my first job interview next week!!  Its a teenie little job at our library for 15 hours a week - but it would cover the grocery bill and allow us to not have to put the kids in any form of summer camps and such like that.  If I got it, I would hope to move up into jobs more appropriate for me too...like with the computers.  So while its not quite enough job, it might be good for now.  DS is camping with boy scouts this weekend...Im worried about him - he kind of looked like a cold was coming on when he left :(  So...exercise!  Wednesday and Thursday was all about walking...the rain has FINALLY ended!! Yesterday I wanted to bike in the worst way but it never warmed up....so I went to Zumba last night (a friday night???? THATS dedication!) because today is supposed to be 70 degrees and sunny!!!  So I think DH, DD and I will take a lunchtime bikeride for a picnic or something relatively close by.  It wont be 20 miles at lightning speed but at least we'll be outside, together and showing our DD the importance of exercise.

Well I was a little miffed my day didnt turn out as expected.  DH said that DS was supposed to sing at church so we RAN there only to discover that he didnt have to.  We had planned to take that bikeride to the dairy farm again but then my DH fell ASLEEP on the couch!  When he woke up he whined that it was too cold.  I was sooooo mad!  I took the dog on an extra long walk and I was SWEATING out there!  It is such a gorgeous day in the 70's and especially after all of the rain we've had!!! So we ended up doing NOTHING and then going out to dinner to my pleading.  All I wanted was a darn BIKERIDE!!!  I wouldve taken an 8 mile ride to Dairy Queen!  (That was a RANT!!!)  But at least I was brought my netbook, coffee and presents to my bed by my kids....while breakfast was being cooked.  I opted to eat in the kitchen with the family.  Anyway, tomorrow I will be riding one way or another.  I get a fill on Tuesday and if last time is any guide, this one will hurt even more.  So I might skip Zumba for the week (last time I got a fill, the next 3 Zumba classes really bothered my TE).  But I hope to get a good talk with PS about dates and final fills and sizes.  If I get another 80cc's Ill be at 415ccs....I think I may want a 400 implant.

Rennasus - STOP MOVING!!!!  LOL - I mean, Im glad you were able to stop the leakage but that is scarry!!!  Glad you had fun in LV and got a chance to take your mind off of stuff! We went to Kings Island today (Maria you know KI, right?) but a quick thunderstorm closed the rides after 4 hours....we went to check things out, really.  Now I am SO POOPED.  I mustve walked 5 miles today!! Yes fluffing is HARD.  I cut up my old padded bras and used those forms up until now.  I dont think they will work after the next fill.  I waffle between B and C cup....a B is a little snug but I dont fill a C.  The B cup is much easier to match though.  Now that mt TE is at its mid-fill-softening, I am getting boob greed again.  I feel like right before I get a fill, the TE is SHRINKING or something!!  I looked at myself naked tonight and though - NAH thats not big enough yet!!!  I better be satisfied after this next fill or its a new PS for me! And Id love to meet you gals someday!! Melanie is probably the closest to me but I like to travel too!!!  LOL",

      "Content": "May 24, 2011 11:34AM - edited May 24, 2011 11:35AM by SuebeeBC Hi everyone - awake from my nap and ready to fill you in!   I started my appointment practically begging but not quite coming to tears over this move of his coming up.  He told me that he waits 3 weeks from the last fill to do exchange - all well and good - until he told me that he has is orders already and they took away all of his O.R. time for June.  I was absolutely heartbroken.  He said - lets double check your symmetry with the implant and TE which we did and he said that we are almost there.  So I got 80ccs in (which I could really feel but was I going to ADMIT that???).....so I am at 495ccs.   Then he said I have to go back in one week, we are really cutting it close, but he MAY be able to work something out - BUT if I have complications from the surgery - I dont have a PS to go to until Mid July when the new one comes (a lady), I would have to go into Dayton for followups until then, and he wouldnt be able to do my nipple/areola.  But as an option, I could always fly to Texas to see him.  Ok, so all said and done (is this making sense?) my husband and I came away with completely different feelings on what he was trying to tell me (I think he speaks cryptically).  I thought he is bringing me back in a week to maybe top me off and tell me he cant do the surgery....DH came away thinking that Im going back to finalize everything and have my surgery the 3rd week of June.  Lots more was said at this appointment but this is the gist.  So I dont know what end is up STILL.  This fill is really hurting more than the others.  Rennasus - I know 80 sounds like a LOT but people really handle it differently and for me each fill was harder so 4 other fills at 80 were NOTHING for me.  Some people cant hack 30ccs....Id see how you feel going forward. So no Eday.  It could be the 3rd week of June or Ill end up having to wait for the new PS to arrive (July 1), in-process the base (2 weeks) and THEN see me...then there would be pre-op.  I will DIE if I have to wait until August.  I know there is nothing I can do about it but my whole summer is about being at the waterpark and pool and my boobs are SO different now that it looks like I had the MX on my natural side.  That was my rant/vent for the day. Redsky - Im glad youre done with fills!!!  Ill be getting a 350 and 450 Mentor HP.  Ill take pix of me today at 495 with and without clothes and get them online so we can compare!!! Rennasus - glad you made a decision youre at peace with.  Keep us up to date on how things go!!! I obviously didnt do Zumba today.  I dont think Ill be able to do much this week again.  I dont want to pull anything and add more pain to it.  Bad news too....my MIL has taken a dramatic turn for the worse.  She has a rare form of lukemia that they have been treating with meds and transfusions but at her advanced age they cannot do much for her.  She has gotten so bad in the past 2 weeks that they have decided to stop treating her and gave her 2 weeks.  We were going to leave tomorrow for NH but now believe that it will be too much for the kids to sit in a hospital for 5 days watching Grandma decline, so my DH will go alone.  We may all have to fly out there for a funeral if it happens while he is gone.   Anyway, sorry Im Debbie Downer today....rough day at the office!!!",

I am feeling better today and will hopefully ride tomorrow and zumba saturday.  Have a GREAT day everyone!!!",

DH is back from NH today.  He got home last night.  Im going to run to the library to do some research for my interview tomorrow.  See what they have and how I can make myself sound like a research professional and all.  Other than that its laundry and cooking and trying to keep my TE from bothering me.  I think Ill take it easy until Zumba on Saturday.....550ccs is a lot for my little chest to take I think!!",

Maria - you're going to have the same problem...its the curse of going into surgery all fit.  I plan to stay the course on the pain meds for a full 4 or 5 days so I stay a little woosy. PS doesnt want me on Motrin at least until day 5 anyway.  I may cut back to one pill instead of two but I think its more important that I sleep than start moving about. Melanie - Sorry about the scheduling issues...I hope its just an inexperienced receptionist.  If the doc wants to see you twice a week, the onus is on them to fit you in.  My PS receptionist would mumble that there was nothing open every flippin tuesday (this isnt a surprise, Im here every tuesday, lady!) but I would just stare her down....Doc wants to see me on TUESDAY!  LOL  And sorry youve been having a bad time right now.  We are here for you!  When is your birthday?  {{{big hug}}} from me for your day! Anniemom - Thanks.  For some reason, my computer stored my password for the picture forum so I never have to key it!  Gosh I hope my computer is never stolen!!!  And as for the family, I told my DH in no uncertain terms that I am doing NOTHING between now and our trip back to New England (after my post op appt) because I cannot afford another healing issue.  He does get it.  If something happened while we were away, that would be very bad.  So lets just get through the 2 weeks.  My last incision issue happened about 10 or 11 days after surgery...about the time I was feeling great and starting to move around too much.  PS was VERY firm with me about doing nothing...he said \"ONE hematoma and its over\"....ouch....that sounded FATAL!",

Im glad youve been hiking too.  Sounds WONDERFUL right about now!!! Maria - you hang in there too.  BELIEVE me I know how you feel about the bordem....OH DO I UNDERSTAND!!!  But really, two week, or two months or whatever it takes to get better is a BLIP on the map of life.  When my husband was first hesitant about taking our assignment in Japan I said to him \"3 years IS a long time....when youre in it...but I promise some day you will look back on those 3 years and think where did the time go?\"  and we do.  It seems so far away now - like any period in our past...long while youre in it, a blip of life later on!!!!  So heal and take your time and you'll be better for it later!!!!  There thats my pep talk for today!!! I just took my shower and looked and felt and poked around at my girls.  They are not twins anymore but I love them each for what they are.  And they are a total facination to me right now!  The incisions look great, the position is great and the softness is incredible.  They just are different...but I am being patient since like children, they have a long way to go before we know what they will be!!!",

Maria - how did I do it?  Did you notice how much I posted out here that first week???  LOL!!!  I think I duck taped my butt to the chair.  Here comes your pep talk - Sitting down and not moving for that first week was the BEST think I couldve done. PS was so impressed with how I was healing after that first week and is SUPER pleased now.  It will pay off....I promise!!!  Its hard and youll have visions of ellipticals and aerobics classes dancing in your head but stay still!  I actually thought my bike was whimpering when I went through the garage the other day....I miss her so much.  Im going to try to shop in MA or NH this week because there is no sales tax (on clothes in MA) so it will be cheaper.  If I can work out 3 cute outfits Im good.  I dont even have to be dressy (I can wear jeans) but I would rather have a nicer casual look. And I feel like I dont look bigger than a B either. Im shocked I can fit into a d (on the nipple side) because I feel like I look so small.  Now Im going to complain about being small - this whole trip is a crack up!!! Renn - I know you will be on the good side of that statistic....Here's to healing!!!  The finish line is there...just a little further away, but its there!!! Red - I have the Mentors (28.5inch ribcage) and the one side is that 475 so you can see I can handle the width of the mentors.  I think allergans or mentors would be fine on you.  They'll get those 450's in!!! Melanie - I think a lot of docs have a little bit of flirt in them - bedside manner!   A healthy dose of flattery/flirting/encouragement/empathy helps with the healing!  And yeah I second the motion that mid 40's is ALRIGHT!  LOL!!! Well, Im off ot do laundry and pack!  We leave in the morning!  Phew!  Im feeling a little twinge in my left side today...The skin feels like its sunburned - very sensitive - but thats normal since it didnt have the benefit of slow expansion.  But now Im a little achier today than its been on the inside.  I hope thats normal!  It HAS been only two weeks.  Im sure the pec muscle is trying to figure out what to do! Have a great day!!!",

Renn - just looked at your lovely torso,  I anxiously follow your progress! Annie - I posted on the B thread.  I think you'll be in the D club now!   Glad youre doing well!! Red - How was zookeeper?  That takes place at the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston - just about the lamest zoo ever growing up!!!  LOL.  Maybe they are promoting it.  Its in a horrible part of town and was SO run down until they started CARING about it - oh about when my daughter was born.  We took her once and moved away!!  I hope that bladder infection is quickly passing - no more delays for you!!!!  I cant wait to read your post-exchange entries and see your pix.  I just went back and looked at your photos again.  I know youre going to look GREAT!!! Marie - My TE was ever present until exchange - but not painful all of the time.  You should talk to your PS if after a month you still need pain management.  I only needed motrin randomly and then around fills. Julie - I wish I could help with rads- but you have a lot of friends here that can answer that. Baby Sis - No, I cant say I know Missy but then we have lived here only a year and change.  And I am a baby sis by a lot - Im the last of 5 and my brother is 15 years older than me....so ALL of my nieces and nephews are your age or older!!!  I was an auntie at 13. Enjoy your weekend! Maria - I PMed ya.  GF, I tell you that I KNOW we will meet someday - either in Cincy or Chicago.  I promise we'll be in that VS dressing room checking each other out.  Wait did I tell that story yet? Shannon - We caught up last night.    I'm glad you got a little bit of \"Getting back to ME\".  I did end up getting to Maine, by the way.  Had to get some clams!!! Barbara- AHH the meltdowns with DH.  I think I had one that lasted from February to May.  He is much happier with me now.  I think my boobie happy dance is louder right now because of the \"Sad Ass Marching Band\" that was playing at my house all winter!!!  {{{hug}}} We flew back last night because my Daughter's art was selected for the Western Ohio Regional Art Exhibition this year and today is the reception.  Ugh I need to wake up children.  Then my Son's baseball team is playing tournament now (they came in 3rd after the regular season) and they have a game this afternoon - we missed Wednesdays game and they won!  So its going to be a FULL day...then restocking the fridge, laundry and getting back to it!

Red- hopefully the bed reservation is a precaution in case you have a late day surgery.  I had a 6am report and was home around 1 or 1:30.   I was delayed getting out because I wasnt coming out of the anesthesia.  And being a nervous nellie is perfectly acceptable!  I'm glad your aunt is coming out.  I did a lot of marinating (and then freezing) for my DH - thank goodness for grill season! Renn - how much longer for the drain? Barbara- YES get on a bike!!!  Then we can hit the trails next time you do Indy to Dayton!  :-) OK, I just took my 1 month photos....hmmmm.  Where do I start?  Is it ok to complain a little?  I am SURE I am just looking too much, but it looks like leftie is dropping and softening (righty was soft looking a long time ago) and looks LOWER than the other and righty feels like its encroaching again!!  So I look lopsided!!!  I either need to stop taking photos or stop LOOKING at the photos!!!  This is PS's last week in the area and I want to send a pic and say \"is this ok?\" But he already warned me that things will drop at different rates so I know that is the answer.  He'll tell me to 'stick a sock in it'.  I really just want to get my proper fitting because I know I am not wearing the right thing.  Grrrrrr.",

I was/am absolutely foob obsessed....I told my friend when we sat down to dinner last week \"I apologize but its all Ive been thinking about, talking about, and looking at for 8 months!\"  She said its like any thing else youre in the thick of, and it was OK (her daughter is autistic and Ive spent many a phone call with her on that topic!)  But I too have looked and analyzed everyone else.  Youre right - my PS said most women shoot for a C.  But I also realized that I really had no concept of what that meant for me!!!  If I got a C I wouldve been bummed out.  As 'little' or 'proportionate' (however you want to see that) I look in my photos, Im sporting a D cup!  I would LOVE to be bigger - but I know that would mean a REALLY hard time finding bras (I cant shop in stores already), my shirts puckering in front, and even possible implant complications (the pocket not handling the weight).  I WORK SO HARD at keeping perspective!!!  Its my new job! So Maria - I am absolutely with you....I think its totally NORMAL (GASP - we are normal??)  Speaking of....I havent admit this before - but in keeping perspective...my retort to my BFF and BS when I heard about the cancer? \"Oh.  Thank Goodness its not Alzheimers!\"  What kind of reaction is THAT?  At least that thought got me through the 2 weeks before my DH came home. THEN I melted down in a royal way.  (My mom had Alz and all of my beloved Aunts had cancer - In my mind Alz is way worse) Arent we all getting wonderful insights into each other's lives??? Melanie- thanks for checking me out!  Hee hee.  Yeah I peeked at those rads, hair and au natural folders....wow.  I hope you dont get burnt either.  Keep up the good lathering! On a happier note - and relating to the topic of this thread...I found some great new recipies I cant wait to try out!  Now that I am on this side of things, I really want to get back to my usual 'new recipe of the week'...90% of the time the recipe never gets made again, but if its something where I have the ingredients in house normally, I like to try it out.  Im trying to work out this 'going back to work' thing!  Ive never worked nights before so Tuesdays are going to be really hard.  I go in at 4 and dont get a dinner break.  I cant see eating at 3. I'd like to get out to bike today too....another little one where I dont do the hill home.  Im sadly coming to the realization that I wont be ready for the WooMan Challenge.  I was hoping for 3 months, not 2, to train.  A little bummed.  I could always do the recreational 20. ",

Barbara I have to dig out my list that I brought in....but yes on the projection, expectations and fears.  Mine was about being \"Level\" (go figure) because I was a uni and with the upper fullness because Im thin.  I had a little different experience as I got to pick my size based on trying implants on the left side - but you'll want to know that he willl bring in various sizes to match.  You may even get two different implant sizes based on how they lay in the pocket!  Are you getting Mentors or Allergans?  Mentor's product catalog is online and you can look to see how as the ccs go up, the width grows but not in proportion with projection - so I will NOT get much projection out of going up a little amount.  Even at a 475 on the right and 350 on the left, my 475 is missing the nipple projectin and natural tissue over there so its seemingly getting flatter all of the time. Ask also about pain management, drains, what you need to wear afterwards (you see Maria and I were vastly different there), if you'll get getting constipation meds or will need to get some.  Will you need a bra right away?  Does he suggest sleeping upright and for how long? What are the restrictions for the first two weeks (before your post op visit)?  When is your post op?  Can you stretch at all? Is light walking ok?  Should you take any suppliments....protein shakes, vitamins, etc? to aid healing.  When should you expect to be able to drive?  Shower? A lot of this stuff you'll want to know before hand because at least for me, I struggled coming out of anesthesia so I remember little from the time I saw PS after surgery - he spoke mostly to my DH. Ill look at my list to see if I had anything else to add.  But the most important thing is setting your expectations with him.  Thats where women get disappointed.  They expect to look like thier TE or at least as projected and its not gonna happen.  Or they want them closer or further apart or higher or lower or bigger or smaller etc.  Mine change all of the time so I bite my lip when I think to worry about them.  Im level - thats what I wanted.  I also got the implant size I wanted.  Now I need to stop thinking about drop and fluff and stop looking at bras in the store until I can have my proper fitting.",

Barbara - thanks about the job and ick on your weather.  We are in the mid-to upper 90s through another week with heat indexes well over 100 and thats BAD for here.  No biking for me.  :-(((( Melanie - OMG what a day you had!!!!  But Im glad youre down to 12 treatments! I love the countdown!!! Ok, enough catching up....Im still on dinner detail around here!!!!  DH did the beds, the laundry, the dishes, bought new things for the house (which I really dont like when he buys furniture on his own but ok) and entertained DD all afternoon so I cant complain.  He also got a Kurig so I can have my own fresh brewed iced coffee or tea or whatever else I want at any time.  Again its something I was sure I didnt want that I now love.",

NPS suggested a revision for me.  My right is CLEARLY wider (well, duh, its a wider implant) and slightly higher and my scar is a little (ok a LOT) wider and thicker than it needs to be.  Insurance will cover everything but my thought process is that in a bra there is no difference so why risk infection, poor result or complications to fix very minor things at this point?  I said 'no' but the offer is on the table if over the next month or so I notice that miss righty still isnt dropping or things progress in a negative way. ",

(and Shannon and Red, thanks for your pride in me- it means a lot - really it does!!!) Maria the vitamins could be helping the hair! Yeah!  Im glad it has slowed down and you can style it more and feel more normal now.  Thats great! Shannon I dont remember about the guard - I feel like a little kid grasping the main point of the article I hear and forget everything else. Maybe the shield will fill up the blank space in my freyas?  Hmm. Red - YEAH on the ride!!!  And yes good thing its fall - I wonder if I can get away with hoodies at work! Yes surgery - Im not excited or happy about it.  Ive been blocking it out.  I have to reflect why I feel this way but I feel like 'whatever' right now.  I have concerns and fears and excitement and anticipation - but its all coming out blah.  Half of me is happy and the other half wants to postpone it.  Blah....",

I read about your shopping on the other thread.  I think your walks are really helping with oxygen flow and thats great.  But youre right about the cart.  I had a smx so was able to steer with the left and for my right used my forearm and kept the cart closer to my body so less pressure on the right arm.  That helped a lot, but dont know what I wouldve done if I had a bmx. Im hoping youre done in a week!!! My surgery was a week before yours so here's hoping its near the end for you too!! Ill be good tomorrow girls, I promise.  If I wake up and see that todays housework made things worse, I wont go.",

Or something like that!!! Anniemom - Since Zumba last week, I havent done anything to stretch at the incision, I promise!!! Barbara - I have sluggish times as well and dont have additional treatments to wear me down!  Give yourself credit! Its a lot!!!  Some days I still poop out or go to bed with the kids.  As for a little dizzy - yes and I find its water...more water, more water, more water!  UGH I will float away! To all - Im just in from a 20 mile bikeride with DH!!!  We do 10 miles out to the next town and have a sit down meal and ride back.  It was TOUGH!  There is a little gusty wind today so it felt like 'up hills both ways into the wind\" - no lie!  Endurance wasnt there (gee, wonder why?) so I was struggling from mile 8-10 in both directions.  But the bike is so smooth...cant wait for warmer and calmer days!!! Too bad today is the only nice warm day of the week - back to 40's later on!  UGH!",

It beats the heck out of wheat too - I also bought Quinoa Pasta which we will try this week too.  Our grocery bill was HIGH these past two weeks!  The organic stuff doesnt go on sale I think!!! Its quite bad timing to have high bills when you are out of a job! Well, I bit the bullet, speaking of jobs.  I have been out of work since we moved here.  My PLAN (and we all know about those) was to get a job as an aide in my kids' school like I have been for years and years.  This way I can work their hours and have summers off to save on camps and such...even though the pay is low, its a higher payoff in other things.  Well, long story short, they arent accepting applications now that I have decided to try to apply!!!! (shoulda done it in the fall!!) But when I went online, they had a position at the school district office for Management of Data Applications....which is what I did for 10 years pre-kids.  UGH - do I really want a full time job?  I applied to tell my DH that I applied.  He doesnt have a job yet either.  One of us needs one STAT.  So that's why I did it.  I hope there arent 300 people applying but I DO have the degree, 10 years experience in Data Administration and 6 years in working at schools.  Crap.  I have mixed feelings. Sigh - anyway, I think we should all post these new lighter recipes we are finding if they turn out great.  Like I said, Ill be doing the broiled (not sauteed in butter) Shrimp Scampi over Quinoa pasta this week - Ill let you know how it goes!!!",

Rennasus - I had similar yellowish/green stuff that I was able to blot right out of the incision.  At one point I had whiteish stuff filling the hole that I believe was plaque.  PS plucked it out and told me to keep the creme going but not to fill the hole with cream - just keep it moist - so that stuff wouldnt form.  I just would blot my incision daily with gauze and water to get buildup out of there and then do the cream.  Mine was never as large as you say yours has gotten - but at the point where I had 3 holes the BS did say to me that if the incisions didnt look better soon that they would have to take the TE out!  So I understand that shock and worry!!! I became a pest to my PS at the point where you are now.  I asked about taking vitamins, how much protein (not just \"more\"), is it due to lack of exercise (oxygen flow), how much I could move and WHAT I can be doing (walking, stationary bike), should I stop stretching for a time, any other foods I should eat or avoid (caffeine?), sleep positions, showering (should water hit it directly), blotting the wound...etc.  This is about the time my husband said to the PS \"she is really freaking out about this...is the TE failing or is she just slow?  She needs some reassurance here\".  Bless him.  I would suggest you be a little pest too.  This is YOUR body and YOU have to carry around the anguish of the incision and possible things going on all week long....he goes back to his day once you leave the room.  Personally Id rather know whats happening than make up stuff in my head.

Meals - last night was our 'bad' night but we were as good as bad can be.  We had butcher made, hormone free, all pork bratwursts...steamed asparagus (garlic and salt) and rice with butter and herbs.  Tonight is BBQ chicken (home made sauce and the chicken is par boiled to minimize grill time) but not sure on sides....probably yellow squash.  Friday is mexican lasagne and Saturday will be chili.  I hope you have a wonderful day.  Keep up the good work with the exercise, meals, tea, chemo and research!!!

Off to school again to help....last day of school!!!!  Tomorrow is Zumba and I asked for another family ride on Monday so hopefully will get that 30 in before I wont be able to bike again until August at the earliest!!!  Maybe I can squeek in a zumba tonight?  Hmmm....Im having exercise anxiety!  The exercise and cooking will have to go on the back burner for a while....but Ill be your cheerleader again!!!",

I have been lucky that my DH is retired and both kids were in camp last week. Ive been taking FULL advantage!!!

My PS said that since I had two different procedures, to expect drop and fluff (although he just said drop) to happen at different rates and this was normal.  The MX side may be hesitant or faster and thats OK.  He said when all is setlled, they should be the same.  YEAH!  I can clearly see that the pockets are even heights now so in 3-6 months I should have two beauties! Yeah I had one sister with the legs and one with the boobs - I got neither.  Now they will be jealous!  LOL!

I also learned from others that my size shouldnt CHANGE in the drop and fluff- just the appearance of things.  THATS good news. Gotta go get my daughter - ill check back later!",

Renn and Shannon - I see firedancer next thursday!  I cant wait!  Pix to follow! Julie - the mammary fold incision is underneath the breast...the name suggests its IN the fold but its actually above the fold by about an inch so it wont be seen if I wore a bikini top and reached up.  Because I am a UNI and an Augment, I have two different incision types.

Melanie - Yeah!!! 1/3 done!  I was thinking of you today.  Youre like our 'baby sister' here and I am sure I can speak for everyone when I say that we care about you and look out for you!  I always love it when you check in.  Enjoy that reunion.  My boobs were the elephant in the room at our family BBQ...so I know how that feels.  I know youll handle yourself perfectly! Julie - thanks for the kind thoughts - I am glad you have such a compassionate medical team.  That helps! Maria - hope all is well with you.  Breathe deep sister!

I am with you though - I am worried about the lateral move.  How is the cleavage space?  I have NO space when I wear the VS bras and its very concerning.  I look better out of a bra at all....but I realize there is no room for the 475 to go anywhere so I may just have a little space forever.  I bet things are better for you in the 45's.

Shannon - wow you had those sensations too?  Oh I feel better.  I told the doc I was having them at my check up before my first mammo and she said 'hmmm' but that was it.  As for your boys, it IS so nice when you can give one more attention at a time.  Enjoy your young man! Maria its to nice to hear that you are adjusting!  I hope you find the perfect place for you to teach!  That would be awesome! Barbara - ooohhh, I imagine with everyone getting back into a schedule you are getting more itchy!  Youre only about a week out....we want you to heal!!!  and heal perfectly!!! Well, as for me, I did manage to get through TWO Zumba classes on Saturday - back to back.  I did toning at 9:30 and regular zumba at 11.  I hadnt been to toning since before my surgery in June.  It might have been May actually!  I stuck with 1 pound weights and BOY do my shoulders feel it!!!  Its amazing how much weight 1 pound can be when you are dancing and doing so many repetitions!  Zumba class wasnt any slouch either - I thought I would die when the second wind kicked in....but I am really really feeling it now.  Sore everywhere!!!!  But I feel accomplished and like I could do it again in a couple of weeks when work will again allow.  I hope today once the kids get off to school to get in a long bikeride.  We need to break the 34 mile ceiling if we are going to make it to 50!!! Have a great day!!!",

As for meals - Im still not cooking, but every night I make a mixed salad primarily of spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms and eggs (protein) and whatever else I have.  We are working through my spaghetti sauces, chili's and soups I made before hand that are in the freezer.  Meals arent perfect yet, but I have to eat twice as much protein so that is the focus until I can go back to being a little heavier on the veggies.",

My DH retires from the service this month so has been home a lot more than usual.  I am sure he would love it if I was more aggressive with job hunting than I have been....but he understands.  I tell him about this site all of the time.  I think he is happy Im not on facebook as much anymore!!!",

My exercise today is housework - UGH!!!  DH invited friends over for tomorrow night which you KNOW what that means for the spouse!  I already bought snacks this morning and now need to get on laundry and cleaning the house.  I think I will do just one level again and say \"they are YOUR friends coming - I did the kitchen and living room, you can do the game room and bathroom!!!\"  It will be a workout JUST to motivate him right now I think!!!  LOL",

When I ask my PS or BS I get different responses.  BS says \"hmmm...thats not a symptom of anything but if you want PT Ill write a script\".  PS says \"thats nerve damage and it will get better...take some motrin\". Like some of you Id rather treat the problem rather than the symptoms...Im taking enough meds already!!!  I never heard of PMPS so I was SO glad to come across this thread.  Not a club I want to be in, but its good to know I am not alone.  How is everyone doing?  How long did you pain last (based on severity - I consider this a minor-moderate nusance right now)?  Does it get WORSE?

A little background, we are military and  get 'assigned' our docs so I didnt pick the first ones, but this is unsettling!  Oncologist wants to proceed, but I decided to postpone a week to avoid ANOTHER surgery.  I meet the new PS tomorrow.  As long as I feel comfortable with the new PS, I cant see a reason to have a third surgery.  Emotionally, I think looking down and not seeing the reconstruction progressing after the MX would take its toll too.  I have prepared myself for what was supposed to happen.  New PS feels I am making the right choice.  I think so too. Actually on the bright side, this is yet another opinion too so the new PS could very well confirm all of the other information I have been given...or open up new options.  I look forward to meeting with him tomorrow!

Im going to mention it on Monday at my appt. Its not a pain- its just a weird feeling like its tellingme to stop. On other topics - How is the sleeping going?  I slept in bed on thursday and it was a disaster for me.  I had a smx and tried to sleep on the other side but every time my DH moved, I woke up sharply.  I tried again last night giving myself a second position - a 75% on the back (with a pillow wedged under my right shoulder) and made it through the night - waking up briefly a couple of times but thats normal for me.  Not terrible pain this time. What about sex?  DH has been acting a little more touchy over the past couple of days and Id love to get back to it, but Im really worried (and I know he is too) about jostling my right side.  Because of the dermabond, I dont have to wear bandages or anything and my TE's make things very tender.  The TE is far worse than the scar sites! Anyone getting back to other exercise too?  Since Thursday, its been like an awakening for me.  I really want to get out for a walk (if this weather would ever go away!!!).  I know I have to be really careful not to do too much. I am starting to feel better and thats going to lure me into doing something I shouldnt!!! Glad to hear so many of you are doing so well!!! Sue",

Ill probably call the doc in the morning but I am worried that I over stretched or something.  I JUST saw the doctor yesterday and everything looked GREAT.  I only have the dermabond for sutures so no bandages or anything...I just put some gauze on and will make sure it only stays drops for now.

Im having a single skin sparing mastectomy with sentinal node biopsy and expander placed on January 19th.  I am also going back to have breast augmentation on the other side once the right side is all filled up!  I have been found to have high grade DCIS, but because of my very small frame and breast size, a lumpectomy and radiation wouldnt have been a good option.  All BRCA tests were normal!  I have found peace with having the procedure done....ironically, I was in the process of having consults for breast augmentation when I had the mammogram that showed the calcifications. My main concern is the recovery!  As a woman, its hard to let go and let other people do everything...and this being my right side, Im worried how it will affect my day to day life and how long!  Of course I also worry about  my best friend taking on too much...she will and wont take no for an answer!!!  My huband will take care of the kids and house and I am sure I will have lots of meals delivered!  But with the tissue expander and how long that will take...then the recovery from the other side's implants...Im a little freaked about how long it will be before I feel like getting out to hang with my friends or go to my Zumba class etc! That was more of a vent than anything....Ive done a lot of research and a lot of chatting about it.  I just wish it was last month and not in 2 weeks that I am getting this done!

I understand DCIS gives you time.  I was high grade-3 and was assured that the 7 week delay wouldnt really effect anything in the long run.  In effect, I got \"the cells look agressive so Id like to get you in within 2 weeks\".....and then \"nope, we are waiting until Mid January\"...huh?  I couldve gone on the 19th of January anyway but waited to meet the new PS and be able to start recon instead of adding a third surgery and additional delay. I would raise my concerns to your team.  They may be able to calm your fears.  I hate how DCIS gives you that hurry-hurry-nah, you can wait kind of feeling.  There is a DCIS forum here too where you can find more information.

Im 3 days out now.  I came home thursday morning and am facinated with the changes.  Im feeling less pain but more overall grogginess.  I slept through the night last night and completely missed my midnight vicodin.  I am astonished with my range of motion and hope that keeps up.  I have that darn path report on the brain though and cant wait for that already.  The RN told me (she wasnt supposed to) that I had 5 nodes removed and that worried me immediately....Like what was wrong that my doc had to take 5?  I thought she was taking 1-3???  So I worry. I also get the feeling my surgeon and ps dont like each other.  My initial ps broke his arm so I had to change PS's and this new one does things differently.  For example the first PS wouldnt have put the TE in if there was a problem with the nodes, but this PS didnt make mention that he was waiting for the nodes.  Surgeon rolled her eyes. Surgeon didnt like the markings that PS made on me before the surgery at all and kinda laughed.   I didnt even see surgeon after I was out...I did see PS the next morning.  He is taking the drains on Tuesday but surgeon was thinking 2 weeks.  I just think surgeon is far more conservative than PS.  Its so bizarre that the female surgeon is far less sensitive about the end result (being a woman) and more concerned about getting the DCIS out than the PS who is a man and very concerned about the look of things to come.  A little vent there.  Anyway, best wishes for continued healing for everyone....and blessings to those still to go this coming week!

No one told me to strengthen my core and legs before hand, but my PS, when I asked how soon I could Zumba again, told me that it was great that I was doing it and it would help my recovery so much if my muscles were strong before going in, It wouldve been nice if they told me that around time of DX!!!  Maybe its so people who dont exercise much dont go and overdo before surgery!

She brought in the PS so they could both look.  BS said \"It doesnt look infected, but if it doesnt improve, we'll have to take the TE out\"....while PS said \"it looks like a suture issue\".  Its so nice they can agree. Long story short - I am on antibiotics orally and in creme form for 10 days as a safety measure.  They do not think its an infection but they were really happy I came in SO SOON after noticing the issue and not letting it get worse first.  AND I still keep my fill appt for Tuesday and if everything looks good then, I can continue as normal! So fingers crossed!  I really dont want to be this far along and to reject my TE at this point!  The only thing that has gotten me through the loss of my breast is the hope of them looking nice again.
