    "Content": "Feb 11, 2015 11:11PM - edited Feb 11, 2015 11:11PM by SusanSmay anotherlifeexperience - I used that exact description this evening (sunburn) when telling my kids how my chest feels! I had a bilateral with no reconstruction two weeks and a day ago and had my drains removed this past Tuesday and my sensations run from that sunburn feeling, to numbness and a tight band across my chest and I can just barley stand the lightest touch on my upper chest. I wonder if maybe our clothing is causing part of our troubles - I have read that many women are super super sensitive to anything touching their chest for a while after surgery, especially their clothing. I am just realizing the times I am most comfortable are the times when I have no clothing touching or rubbing against my chest",
