      "Content": "Lizfully wrote: Hello I'm a 39 yo female with recent onset of Left breast pain, burning sensation and nipple discharge and redness of the breast for about 1.5 week. My L breast has always been larger than my right and I don't discern any noticeable drastic size change or pitting but the skin around the nipple seems slightly changed. I saw my GYN yesterday who ordered diagnostic mammo and US as well and labs to check prolactin levels which I am scheduled for today. I am understandably nervous after reading about my symptoms and having worked at Sloan Kettering cancer hospital for 13 years. But trying to be calm and rational. I do have a prior nipple piercing in that breast which has given me trouble on and off for years after allowing it to close; general itching and occasional twinge of pain and discharge but the overall burning almost constant pain and redness is new and concerning. My question is regarding the redness and pain does it ebb and flow? From what i have read about IBC it seems that it worsens over time and quickly? In my case the pain is much reduced from this weekend as is the redness. I don't want to be lulled into a false state of security because of this if the mammo and US do not show anything definitively. And want to be proactive about requesting further follow up. If anyone has any experience they can offer I would appreciate it! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",

I finally have a diagnosis it is fortunately not IBC however it is one stubborn infected duct. After my last post I saw my OB 2 additional times. My mammo and US were normal and per the doc labs were normal as well. I was put on a course of antibiotics for 7 days \"to see if it helped\" After 7 day course with no improvement I followed up with my OB informed me the pain i was having was all just due to fibrous breasts. I suffered along for another week or so and finally made an appt at John Hopkins breast clinic as I knew the pain discharge and redness was just not normal. After another complete workup at Hopkins including 3D mammo US repeat labs and a culture of the breast discharge it was found I had an infection in the ducts. We tried a round of one antibiotic which the culture was supposed to be sensitive to however it didn't improve much. I'm now midway through a course of a 2nd antibiotics and it seems to be working, so please keep your fingers crossed the next step for me if the antibiotics don't work would be a ductogram and surgical removal of the infected duct. I don't think I have ever been so happy to get a diagnosis in my life. This is a cautionary post while I did not have IBC which I was so worried about please listen to your body and don't allow your concerns to be brushed aside by your physician. You know your breasts, you know your normal, please don't be intimidated by a doctor who tells you everything is fine. Get a 2nd opinion be your own advocate.  ",

So I'm waiting on labs and follow up with my doctor.",
