Two weeks ago 90cc with my next appt for another fill in a week. For the 90cc fill I took a muscle relaxer before. During the fill very minor tightness at the end. My PS started at 60 and let me decide how much to go with the option of 120. I was very comfortable at 90 so stopped there. My BS said go smaller and more frequent with fills given the choice.",
