The research team says they're getting good results, which is great. Mom has had a terrible time with the Verzenio, though, which has been disheartening. She got upside down with the diarrhea (and nausea later) right away and never could get ahead of it with Immodium (we never figured out the right system/timing), so after 10 days on that med combo, she ended up in the hospital for nine days with kidney failure from severe dehydration. On the 4th day she was doing much better, was to be discharged the next day, but instead her BP bottomed out after a big BM and heart rate shot up to 190, followed by atrial fib that had to be corrected after four more days via cardioversion. Oh, and they found a big clot in her leg right before that procedure. Sooooooo.......now she's home and doing much better, but very concerned about treatment. She's been back on the letrozole for several days but after one day back on Verzenio at a reduced dose (50 down from 150) the diarrhea unnerved her (preserving her electrolyte level is high priority) so she is having second thoughts about continuing with the verzenio and the trial. She didnt take any Immodium with it at all, and I reminded her a lower dose could be more tolerable/manageable, but didnt mean the diarrhea would go away. The other complicating factor here is a small section of her colon that has narrowed d/t METS, so a bit of diarrhea is useful in her case. Sorry to be the first response to your drug combo shout-out and have a harrowing story to go with it! Maybe more will find us with the thread bumped and have insight for us both. Don't forget, the research doc told us they ARE seeing good results with letrozole and verzenio, and moreso with this 3rd drug they're studying.",
