But I'm having a very tough time trying to make a decision as to which to go with. I am concerned about the invasiveness of the preparation for brachytherapy, and risk of infection during and post as well as the possibily of post seroma happening. And from what I've read there doesn't seem to be much info on the long term effects of this type of radiation. I would assume because it is still a fairly new type of method. My only misgiving about doing external is that it will touch my lung. I have always been healthy and somewhat of an active person up until being diagnosed with BC. So I have not really been faced with having to make this type of decision. I nee to make a final decision by early this week. Feeling so very overwhelmed!",

And ie. infection: Good to know, I will ask about antibiotics to be given during treatment as a preventative. The BC centre I am at in Canada only uses the interstitial multicatheter, no balloon but I will definitely check out the brachytherapy threads on this site. Thx again and best to you ",

I'm still trying to decide though, brachytherapy or external rad. But after reading through a lot of the posts here, it is reassuring to hear how positive everyone's experience was. I'm going to sleep on it tonight and make my decision tomorrow.",
