Its funny really, because I always said \"if I ever got cancer I'd stop..........\" and there was a huge list of what I would give up. But then faced with the Dx, that went out the window. I've known way too many 'clean living' people, (non smokers, non drinkers, healthy diets and regular exercisers) suffer from, or die of illness and disease commonly associated with 'unhealthy' lifestyles that I don't hold much faith in what causes what these days. I remember when I was pregnant with my children, the doctors back then were big advocates on trying to get you to eat liver, (yuk) apparently it was full of iron and very beneficial to the growing fetus. Turns out nowadays, there's an enzyme in it that they believe may be linked to spinabifida. Now I'm not saying that making healthy lifestyle changes is a bad thing, but it's not something I've personally decided to do. I plan on enjoying the things I have always enjoyed. I'd rather be a happy sick person than a miserable 'healthy' one ;)",

Now I don't regret choosing to have BMX, and if I had the chance to have a do-over, I would make the same choice, but I don't think going in to it I reallyknew what I was in for. Ziggy mentioned about nipple sensation, but that's not all, the nerve damage from the mastectomy leaves you with no feeling in the 'breast skin' for quite some time, and sometimes you never get all the feeling back. (so my Plastic surgeon informs me...I'm still at the no feeling stage, 3 months post op). That was a total shocker for me. I guess common sense should've told me that would happen, but honestly, I'd never had a mastectomy, didn't know anyone who'd had one and all I figured was the same skin sensation but with no nipples or areolae (spellcheck was pretty insistent the plural of areola was not areolas)Â  I think, besides the scars, it's the one thing that really got to me the most. I've actually been blogging about my BC journey, and I just did a post mastectomy update. I'm not the greatest blogger, but you might find some of what to expect after mastectomy. http://flyinthecoffeepot.wordpress.com/2014/03/22/post-mastectomy-3-months-on/",
