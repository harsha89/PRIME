But if I did, wouldn't you have known also?\" So we assume the inverted nipple is somewhat new. The doctor found absolutely nothing on the mammogram, but sent her for an ultrasound two weeks ago just to make sure. Well, absolutely nothing was found on the ultrasound either. The doctor said \"I'd still like you to see a breast surgeon, there has to be a reason why it's inverted.\" I was wondering if anyone knows of any cases where this has happened--good or bad. There were no lumps, nothing on the mammogram and nothing on an ultrasound. My mom is worried because her mother had breast cancer which she treated and it never came back. I'm not as worried. I'm just hoping that it if was cancer, it would have been seen by now. We should be glad that nothing has been found yet, but without any answers we still worry! -Paige Log in to post a reply",
