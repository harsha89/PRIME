I've also had a hysterectomy and came through it with flying colors about 4 years ago! Your ideas for \"getting ready\" are great ideas! I've kicked up my probiotic also and continue to exercise as much as possible to get ready! I just wanted to tell you that your post was just what I needed right when I needed it...surgery on February 21st! Sending hugs and thanks! :)",
