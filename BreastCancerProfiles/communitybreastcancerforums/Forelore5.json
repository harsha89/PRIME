He sent me to an oncologist for genetic testing. I waved it for the fact both my mother who passed from bc and both my sisters had Brcca done. It was negative and both my sisters ended up with bc so I started Tamoxifen as a preventative. I can write a novel on what happened with that. I took it for 4 years had to stop in March for uterine problems that ended up with hysterectomy in June . I was scheduled a mammo and ultrasound same time as my 6 week check up from hysterctomy I live over an hour from my Gyn so it was easier than coming back in a week. I was checking out when the nurse came and said I needed to do more mammo pics. I got the call the next day saying I had an appointment with the surgeon . The surgeon said there were 2 new spots in my right breast and he scheduled the biopsy . I had it last week and got the path report today the surgeon was in a hurry told me DCIS and told me I need further testing starting with an MRI. I asked why he said the oncologist could answer my questions next week and walked out. So now I am am confused and angry for being brushed off",

I have a very strong family history of bc DCIS . My surgeon said I was high risk so he is sending me to an oncologist . So confused as to why an MRI after the biopsy and path report. And why he didn't give more info to me today",

Five years ago I had a biopsy for a mass it was benign so my Gyn and surgeon suggested a consult with an oncologist because of family history. My Dr originally wanted Brcca testing done but my mother and both sisters had it done and it showed negative, they all still had bc even though Brcca was negative. So she started me on Tamoxifen for 5 years and mammo and ultrasound every 6 months with Mri every 2 years. So I had no new cysts or masses in 5 Years I went in for my 6 month mammo and ultrasound when they asked me to come back and do more mammo pics they found something. The next day my Gyn called and said there were cysts and a solid suspicious looking mass. And scheduled a core biopsy the next day. I didn't even get to see any report from mammo or ultrasound . I have to wait until Wednesday for pathology result Log in to post a reply",
