There is one interesting article which shows that the residual risk of recurrence five years after completing adjuvant treatment.  http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/100/16/1179.full It shows that grade 1 tumors tend to recur later than grade 3 tumors, something which has been confirmed by other studies.  Tumors that also tend to recur later are hormone positive and HER2-.  Most medical oncs will consider you cured after 10 years, although there is always a residual risk.  My great aunt had breast cancer in her early 50s and died in her late 80s of brain cancer.  I always wondered if it was a late recurrence of her breast cancer.  Likely not, but who knows! I've come to terms with my risk of recurrence.  Anybody could be diagnosed with a stage IV cancer (or hit by a bus, or die in a plane crash) tomorrow.  Sure, my chances of dying of breast cancer are on average higher than somebody else, but I've done all I can do to minimize that risk.  Now it's about enjoying and not worrying about the things that may or may not happen tomorrow that are out of my control.  Before I came to this conclusion, I read almost every study about prognosis and survival on Google, so it took a while.   I hope that you can come to the same conclusion!",

In fact, if you are doing AC and Taxol there is very little chance of them working. Not to mention the fact that they are extremely expensive and an additional stress on treatment days! They do work quite well with other chemo protocols - you can see which on their website. My suggestion to you is to invest the money that you would have spent on the caps in some very good wigs. I also completely relate to your feelings of putting your loved ones through this. I felt like that initially too as I have always been an achiever and a good kid, mainly as a reaction to my brother being severely handicapped. I felt it thoroughly unfair that I should be causing more stress to my parents. I realized though that it wasn't my fault and that it was completely necessary for me to be selfish at that time of my life. I hope that you are able to come to that conclusion too. Best wishes.",

As for the cold caps, the website shows a 36% success rate with ACT - 4/11 had \"adequate\" hair protection. I met two other women who did it who were on other chemo drugs and had asked to be put on those because of the better chance of keeping their hair with caps. One had hair that thinned considerably and receded but was intact after treatment. She wore head bands to cover the receded part as it grew back. The other had to wear a demi-wig because she lost most of the hair on the top of her head. Once you find out what regimen you will be having, I suggest seeking out others on the cold cap thread that had success with that regimen and ask them exactly how they define that success. Also, check out the success threads. You will see women who have survived for 5, 10, 15, even 25 years and that includes women with TN. There is hope.",

I stopped my Lupron shots after chemo.  It took a year for my period to return after that.  My doctor then prescribed me Zoladex as an additional adjuvant therapy with Tamoxifen.  I'll stop taking both in a year or so to try for babies!  :) Best of luck - the fertility felt like adding insult to injury and is very difficult for both the patient and her husband!  I can totally relate.   ",

If you are worried about hair loss, I personally know two girls around our age that used the Penguin Cold Caps and kept most of their hair.  There are several women on here who have had success with that too.  It does not work consistently for every chemo regime but it is an option. The other thing that is very important is to look into preserving your fertility.  I haven't had kids yet and I was able to freeze some embryos.  There are many options to help ensure that you will be able to start a family later on in your life.  It takes a while so it's best to get moving on it.  You can always cancel the procedures if you don't end up needing chemo.

Has anybody out there done this at his salon or elsewhere?  What were your experiences? I spoke to the girl that was featured in the news article about his salon and she was very happy with the results. Log in to post a reply",

I told my parents as soon as I had the official diagnosis and that was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  I then ignored my friends until after my pathology came back from my surgery, almost a month and a half.  I just didn't have the strength to deal with it right away and before I knew exactly where I stood.  At work, I only told my boss and two of the employees I am closest with.  When I missed work, I told those effected that I was dealing with some personal issues at the moment.  :)",
