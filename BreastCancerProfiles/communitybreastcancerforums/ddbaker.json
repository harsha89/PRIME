I also have very dense breasts and noticed a bruised feeling in outer quadrant of right breast and felt a lump there also. I noticed that it isn't as painful as it was a few days ago and the lump is now more of a mass. It is close to the chest wall and not free floating or round. This morning as I was putting on deodorant on the top part of my armpit I noticed a sore spot as well. Nothing swollen just sore. I was seen by my PCP on Tues and she ordered an ultrasound but it has not been scheduled as of yet. I am a little concerned and obviously curious because I have been reading these boards like crazy. I have also felt a little run down the past few months. Tired, headaches and just overall fatigue. Anyone have anything similiar?",

I stopped the HRT and MRI is scheduled April 18. My questions is, will the radiologist or MRI tech be able to tell me anything? I have heard of radiologist informing patients of abnormal MRI results.",

I initially thought that since I had to wait 30 days for the MRI it must not be serious. But I am not sure if that is accurate. Hormone replacement therapy can alter the MRI picture. After reading and doing research I have decided to proceed with biopsy most likely whether it is recommended or not. It sounds like ILC is slippery to detect. I appreciate all of the responses, it helps with the waiting.",

I had my yearly mammo yesterday and immediately after the mammo I was taken in to have an ultrasound. The radiologist finished my US and said I needed to have an MRI. I received the results of both tests yesterday and my doc didn't seem to concerned but I work in the office and was able to get a copy of my imaging. The recent US mentions mild distrortion of architecture, areas of post acoustic shadowing. All in the left breast which is whereÂ I feel the mass. R breast is normal. I am 41 and been on hormone replacement therapy for almost 10 years. I have to wait 30 days before I can have the MRI because they want me to discontinue the hormones I take so they are out of my system prior to the test. Of course, working in a medical office I do what we tell others NOT to do and I immediately google the ominous phrases on the US and am certainly concerned. Anyone else have experience with anything similiar? Log in to post a reply",

It feels solid but not hard and it is not floating but closer to the chest wall. I would say in between a mass and a lump. I have always heard that breast pain is not a symptom of cancer so I am not that worried, more curious. I got into my PCP yesterday and she has ordered an ultrasound but I probably get that scheduled until next week. No strong history of BC but being on HRT for 15 years prompted me to visit my PCP.",

The MRI shows a type II plateau surrounding a 5x5x3 lesion. That isn't a huge abnormality but I just WANT TO KNOW!! So frustrating! My thoughts are with each of you :)",
