And I agree with mlp, I've gained more from the discussion boards than from my docs!  I've got three more weeks until my appointment. The thought of being free from pain is so wonderful, and I haven't had near the problems that you all have had. Guess it wasn't meant to be for me. Much love to all who have taken time to share their stories- keep 'em coming!",

But you all know the feeling well.  Also sore from physical therapy to prevent frozen shoulder, another unpleasant side effect of the pain from the tissue expanders.  Hopefully I will come through this with grace and humor as I have seen so many times on this message board.",

I have had chronic pain from the expanders and it has effected my mental health as well.  I go to my PS on August 23 and want the expanders OUT! How much physical therapy did you all have?  Any first time lymphedema from removal of expanders?  Do you prefer the flat look? For those that wear a prosthesis, how long was it before you could wear one without pain?  How long before driving?  Sorry to ask so many questions, but I've been looking for others like me for soooo long!  You all give me so much hope. The hope of a full, normal, happy, pain free life- sweetest hope of all!!!",
