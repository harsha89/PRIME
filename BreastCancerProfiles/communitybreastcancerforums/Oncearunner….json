      "Content": "Oct 23, 2016 09:01AM - edited Oct 23, 2016 09:04AM by Oncearunneralwaysarunner Hi there, I buy my sleeves and gloves from Certicare (http://certicare.ca) in Ottawa. I usually pick them up in person but I do know they ship orders too. They carry a few brands as well. They do fittings as well so it might be worth it for your friend to take a drive if she can, it's about 2 hours from Montreal. The staff is really good. Now that I've been fitted, they have my info on file and I just email to place my order and they make sure I have the right size. They have shipped me orders when I was unable to make it in to pick up my order. Perhaps that could be an option for your friend. Or Certicare might be able to recommend a fitter in Montreal that offers similar services. Oh and I forgot to add, they are really good with replacing garments that might have issues with them. I had a problem with the last gloves I ordered and they worked with the company to get me replacements. Hope that helps.",

I now know the time of my surgery and the time I have to be at the hospital for which makes this so much more real. Time to pack my very small bag, if all goes well it is day surgery and I'll be home to sleep. I managed to get everything I wanted to do done, well almost everything but what is not done can wait. Hezzer - you may want to read \"Salt Sugar Fat\" by Michael Moss. I recently read this book and loved it. It looks at the processed food industry and looks at the history of the large food corporations, how food is produced now a days and what it contains and how sugar, fat and salt are added to foods and how it makes us crave those products more, therefore resulting in more sales. Corpor and Warrior_woman - I'm glad I'm not the only one who has the itch to get out there for a run. My running took a back seat during chemo and I was just getting into a routine again only to be laid up for a while. Chemo took a lot out of me and I have to rebuild from scratch. Hopefully we won't get too much snow this winter and getting the runs in will be easier. I'm thinking I need a big, audacious goal such as running the Dopey Challenge in January 2015 to get me fully motivated again. For everyone having surgery this week, all the best and my thoughts are with you. Hopefully the meds will wear off soon enough and I'll be back to posting soon.",

So far all is going well. There were no surprises with surgery. We just have to wait for the pathology results. Pain is well under control. I had a few Percocets yesterday but no where near as much as I was allowed. I'm going to try sticking to Tylenol today. My ice packs have been a godsend. A big thanks to all the ladies who provided post-op tips. Thanks to those I rushed out on Sunday and got a couple of button down shirts. So thankful I had those, I don't think I can get a regular shirt over my head. Genie bras (or in my case knock off) are great. I had a couple at home already and they have been really good. I've been sleeping on the couch propped up by pillows and based on last night I think I'll be going back to my regular bed tonight. Time to go and sit with my ice pack!",

I have bit of pain in my arm pit but I had a full node dissection so that is to be expected. The nerve pain going up and down my arm has been interesting. It's not constant but feels like I'm getting acupuncture. My range of motion is slowly coming back but in the mean time I have named my right arm Rex for T-Rex as it does feel like it is a t-Rex arm! That then evolved to my left arm being called Norm for normal since it has full range of motion. Yep, I have a twisted sense of humour!",

I've been told no strenuous activity for a month but I'm looking for real life feedback. I'm a little impatient with things like this :) I have a question for the stomach sleepers out there. How did you keep yourself from rolling over on your stomach while sleeping right after surgery? I'm afraid of causing pain or worst by accidentally rolling over. Any advise would be great.",

It's an over the counter product in Canada, no need for a prescription, not sure about elsewhere. It's a little pricy, I know I had a sticker shock for the size of the tube, but so worth it especially with the year of Herceptin treatments.

They are a little pricy but they have a couple of models that you don't need to pull over your head. The model I use ties in the back with a regular bra closure and then one closure higher up to turn it into a racer back style. The straps are fully adjustable too. I usually tie the regular closure in the front and then roll it around before putting my arms through. Then I close the top. The only issue I have right now is with tying the top due to my limited range of motion in my right arm, it's a little harder than usual. The other nice thing is that the arm holes tend to be a little low so it doesn't hit my ALND incision. Hope everyone is having a good new year and best wishes, especially health for 2014.",

I don't think there is a correlation between being introverted and the amount of people you tell, it's more of a comfort level thing. My husband and I are both only children so we told our parents, they in turn told our aunts and uncles. My friends were told, including Facebook friends. My social network is really small so most people I'm friends with on Facebook are those I do want to keep in touch with. As far as co workers I told my management team and those I worked closest with. I took a leave of absence and I didn't want people to speculate why I was off. I also told new people at work when I started back part time. Given that I work in a cube farm some people knew without even me telling them.  If I were to do it all over again, I'm not sure I would be as opened with people at work. Some people really have no boundaries and while no horrible situation happened, it wore me down to have to explain things to people. I also found co workers were the ones most likely to address the issue with \"that tone\". Maybe my friends just know better! One thing we did with friends that worked nicely was a periodic email update. Every time I had a chemo treatment, or major updates to provide, my husband would draft an email. I would review it then he would send it out. We were really open in those emails. That way everyone knew the same thing at the same time. What happened is that when I did meet up with friends my illness was not the subject of discussions. It allowed us to have our regular interactions.  I don't think there is a right or wrong with this. Go with what ever your gut tells you.",

I'm 31 and I have a three year old at home, she was 2 and a half when I started chemo. She would have grabbed at a PICC line. The nice thing with the port is that it's pretty much part of me and I can do what ever I want. Shower, swim, you name it. I don't have to worry about getting it caught on something or getting it wet (once it's healed). Having it accessed is easier than IV, there is no need to look for and find a vein. Once the needle is in, you don't feel it like you do with a IV needle. I wear tank tops all the time in the summer, and mostly scoop or v-neck shirts in the winter and my port shows. I can understand why you might be self conscious about it, I was a little when I first got it but It got to the point where it was too hot last summer and decided I was going to wear what was comfortable for me. All you see once the incision is healed is a small bump on my upper chest. I've never had anyone make comments about it, nor have it had anyone stare at it. I really don't notice it anymore, it's just there. Hope my experience helps provide some insight for when you make your decision. All the best with the upcoming treatments. Edited to add: chunky necklaces or scarfs are a great way to camouflage the port while still wearing tank tops :)",

The two dots between my breasts are large and seem off center to my body which bothers me more than the size. I can't see the ones on my sides so they don't bother me. ",

It's great to see the side effects ease up and know that you won't experience these again. I finally had my appointment with the RO yesterday. We finally have a plan in place for rads. I have my simulation on the 27th, an education session on January 7th and I start on January 13 for 6 weeks including the week of boosts. Looks like I'll be laying on my back with my arm up. I have a referral for physiotherapy to get the best range of motion in my arm before we start. I had surgery at the beginning of the month, and that's part of the reason why I'm starting in the 13th, give more time to get my arm back to normal. Safe travels for those of you traveling over the holidays, especially this weekend if you are in Eastern Ontario and surrounding areas. Nasty storms forecasted for the entire weekend.",

I'm like TeamKim, I stop and pick up a coffee either at Starbucks or at the hospital Tim Hortons before a treatment. The lack of taste buds just might make it a little easier on my wallet :) Is anyone using, or been advised to use Glaxal Base cream or calendula cream twice daily during treatment? I have a sample of the Glaxal Base and while unscented it stinks. I'm wondering if anyone found the calendula cream to be the same.  sbp - I too don't deal well with changes to plans other unknown for that fact. I usually want things all planned out that done right away. What I found works well for me is to look at a particular situation and see what is within my control. If it's not within my control, I try to not stress over it. That's the hard part. If there is something within my control then I do what ever I can to make things move faster. It makes me feel like I have a little more control and it helps. I'm sharing in the hope that it helps a little. Hope everyone is having a good 2014!

I didn't have that pocket of fluid buildup which made it hard to identify the site.  LanaM - guess what I was thinking about when I was laying there yesterday? Yep, the cost of the machine.

Sorry if this is a bit of a rant. I was all ready and set to get moving forward and it has been rescheduled. I got all the way to being placed on the table and into position only for the tech to notice the nice huge seroma I have in my armpit where the lymph nodes were taken out. After discussions with another tech and the RO on call that day, it was decided that it would best to do the scan after I have the seroma drained. Any changes in the contour of your body affect the way you receive the actual radiation and impacts the plans they develop. I'm rescheduled for my simulation for the 6th of January but I somehow have to manage to reach my surgeon's office to have this thing drained before the 6th which I expect to be a challenge due to the holidays. As of right now my treatment is not being delayed but it might if the scan has to be pushed back.  I noticed some of you mentioned wanting to lose the extra chemo weight, I do too but I've been advised to wait until radiation is finished to drop it. It's for the same reasons as why they are not doing my simulation yet, any changes in your body contour affects treatment. I have about 25lbs to lose and was hoping to get going on that so that I could avoid having to buy new clothes in a bigger size to go back to work. I can work out but I've been advised against actively losing weight. Good thing I can live in yoga pants and running gear, most of that still fits me due to the stretch in it! As for vitamins, I've been advised to stay away from vitamin A, C and E and any supplements containing anti-oxidants as that works against what radiation is doing. I haven't been told to stay away from much else.  On a positive note, my hair is growing back but really slowly. I had my last chemo treatment two months ago and you can still see scalp but it seems that there is a bit of hair all over my head right now. It's about half white and half brown but I'm normally a natural red head and way too young (31) to be having that much white hair! I'll be glad to have insulation on my head again, hats are great but I would like to sleep without a tuque :)",

My skin is looking sunburnt but no blisters or any other issues other than being itchy. I have the cortisone cream but I find that it doesn't do much.

FEC-D eliminated all three tumours I had in my breast and the cancer that had traveled to my lymph nodes. here is my experience with FEC-D: overall I found the FEC much harder than the D. I was nauseous and slept for about a week with FEC but only had to deal with bone and muscle aches with the D. I also react strongly to medication that causes sleepyness and nausea so I'm sure that is just part of what is normal for me, not everyone is as fatigued as I am.  I would give the following advice based on my experience: 1. You might be sore after your port placement, if you have a port, it will go away in a couple of weeks. My neck and back were really stiff for a few days, then the soreness was just at the port site. 2. Emla cream is my friend! You can get it over the counter in Canada and it numbs the skin, put it on before going for a treatment and you won't feel the needle going in. 3. If you have your blood work done at a lab and not through your port, make sure to keep well hydrated and your arm and hand warm. It makes it easier to find a vein, my veins disappeared during chemo. 4. Take the anti-nausea meds and let your MO know if they don't work, I had to have mine constantly adjusted. 5. Take pain meds as prescribed when on the D. I was alternating between Advil and Tylenol every four hours and it worked great. I learned my lesson when I skipped a dose :) 6. Ask if they have hand and feet ice packs when on the D. I used them and it saved my nails. They are slightly more brittle than before but they look normal. Hope you have little side effects with chemo.",

Mommy13 - good luck next week, we'll be thinking about you on the 27th. Jetnet91 - hope your side effects are manageable after your first treatment, they do wear off. About the \"nesting\", I had bouts of nesting before each treatment and yes, they felt like the nesting I went through when pregnant!  gonein40 - I know what you mean about the anxiety related to not knowing. I find what helps for me is to read as much as possible on a subject and be as prepared as possible. We each have our methods, I haven't tried the guided meditation/relaxation slv58 suggested but that seems like a very good idea and I will probably give it a try in the future. Brioche78 - I have a port, so I don't know how the D is on veins but overall I found the D easier than the FEC. Completely different side effects for me, I found it easier to deal with muscle and bone pain than with the fatigue and fog. Everyone is different though. Stay warm today.",

It was temporary relief but helped a bit. Make sure to mention that to your oncologist. When I did he told me to keep an eye on it and report if it got worst. If it had gotten worst he would have looked at adjusting the dosage. I'm almost four months out of chemo and the feeling has pretty much gone away.

I had my CT simulation and tattoos, I have my potions and lotions to try and keep my skin nice and happy. I now know that I will only get 25 treatments as opposed to the 30 we were originally discussing. I'm getting my breast, axilla and clavicle area radiated.  I will not be getting the extra 5 boost treatments to the surgical site since it cannot be clearly identified on the CT scan and therefore my RO cannot accurately target the surgical site for the boost. I had a lumpectomy. Has anyone else experienced this? My RO is referring me to another RO who does brachytherapy as it may be possible to identify the surgical site by ultrasound and get the boost that way. I'll know more details when I meet with him or her.",

That kicked started the whole process. I'm 31 with no other significant health issues and no history of breast cancer in my family, therefore no reason for regular mammogram screening. After seeing my family doctor, she referred me to breast health clinic. They did an ultrasound and mammogram on the same day. The radiologist had a look at my results, then did another ultrasound himself to confirm the tech's findings. Before I left the clinic that day, I had a appointment for the biopsy, an MRI and a follow-up with a surgeon to get my results. After getting copies of my results, the first set of imaging reported highly suspicious findings and was probably the reason why things went quickly. It was less than a month from the time I found the lump to the time i was diagnosed.",

All I can say based on my experience is that if you think something is out of place have it checked out. There is a high likelihood that it's nothing major, but if it does turn out to be something the faster you can treat it, the better. I think the majority of us go to the worst case scenario spot, I do all the time but keep positive if you can. As far as treatment, I went with chemo first. Partly to shrink the tumours (I had three plus the lymph node) and partly to prevent any spread. Luckily there was no spread. I had my last chemo treatment on October 31. Chemo shrunk the tumours the the point where my pre-op MRI could not see anything, other than the marking clip that was put in. I'm so happy about that. I have surgery in two weeks and then radiation in the new year. Not the most fun I've had, but not as bad as I feared going into it.",

Perhaps the angle taken by the author was a little abrasive and caused feathers to be ruffled. I'm not going to argue that and I respect what ever opinion one has on the article. There have been some very interesting discussions on another tread and there is validity to all opinions that were raised, in my humble opinion at least. To paraphrase what someone said in another discussion on this article, who's to say that any surgical option is the wrong approach to treating breast cancer? We are all unique, our diagnosis are all unique and all have our own reasons for choosing the path we choose. While this op-ed stated that BMX/CPM is the wrong approach to treat breast cancer, mainstream media is constantly implying that a lumpectomy is the wrong approach every single time they report that a celebrity has and a BMX and that they \"did it to save my life and make sure that I'll be at my daughter's wedding\". There is never a mention of the fact that statistically the odds of survival or the same, or discuss the reasons for picking one surgical route over another like we do on these boards. The articles never get down to that level of details. They simply imply that if you don't have a BMX you haven't done everything you could to save your life.  As a result, I'm tired of people who don't know any better question me on my choice of surgery or being asked why I did not do everything I could to beat this thing, or simply being given that look of \"why would you not do everything to save your life?\". People react that way because that is all they see in the media. I do use those opportunities to educate people but I'm also tired of defending my treatment choices. For anyone to imply that I didn't do everything and diminish my fight, or the fight of anyone else who has had a lumpectomy simply pisses me off. I had to vent, the whole issue about how media portrays breast cancer had been bothering me for a while.",

Similarly when I had surgery we told her I had a booboo and that she had to be extra gentle with me. Even at 2 1/2 she was picking up on things being a little off with me sleeping all the time due to chemo. We found that it worked well and we also only told her things as they were happening. We made sure to answer any questions she had in a way that she would understand. We took the same approach a few months back when my dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. She noticed the scar on his head from surgery and asked what it was. We told her that grandpa had a booboo and the doctors had to go and take it out, that they took it out. We haven't elaborated on what the actual diagnosis means but when we feel the time is right we will. Not sure if we will use the word cancer because she doesn't know what that means but we'll chat when my dad's health starts to impact his interactions with her.

I do believe it is important to state and advertise that it is safe to use during treatment but the name itself should not reflect treatment itself. By giving it a more neutral, non chemo or treatment related name, you may also get more customers who are going to keep buying the product after their treatment and allows you to expand your market base.
