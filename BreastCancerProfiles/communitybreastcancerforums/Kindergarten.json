I was admitted to the hospital last week with an aggresive case of cellulitis. The infectious disease doctor told me my immune system had literally crashed and when I told hime I was taking aromasin, he said that that drug can definitely compromise my immune system. Any one out there have a similiar experience or ideas???

      "Content": "Kindergarten wrote: Hi, My name is Kathy and I am new to this site. You are all amazing. I am not Stage 4 yet, but had bilateral breast cancer which is pretty unusual and thought you all might be interested in my case. I was a stage 2b with one positive lymph node. Please contact me if you have any questions. I was treated at Magee Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pa with chemo first, then double mastectomy and then radiation. I am currently on exemestane andmy question is how high should your AST and ALt get before I get concerned. They seem to rise every six months. My current AST is 31 up from 20 and my ALT is 48 up from 30. My onc does not seem too worried but I would like to have an ultrasound. Any out there with similiar scores. Worried about liver mets.
