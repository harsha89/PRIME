Next cycle he may give me neulasta, more expensive , but may work!!!! Any thoughts between the 2.  I know neulasta is $11,000 and neupogen is $650 a shot. Any comments would be helpful.  Have a great day!  Dawn",

I will tell you some patients I have hit it off with and others I haven't, we are people like everyone else, I am however, very professional with all my patients. I have patients come in for cataract surgery and tell me about their knee replacements, digestive problems,and childbirth, nothing to do with their cataracts.  Like everyone, we have a job to do, and time constraints so sometimes you have to brush somethings off and get on with your job,all people who work know what this is like. So don't be so hard on nurses, I will say chemo magnifies everything and we tend to feel things more than ,maybe we did before CA. Nurses who have not been thru this diagnosis may not realize this and maybe  need to be a little more patient and understanding!

To all!  Your true friends carry you thru the rough times, I have found in my 50 years that people who are no comfort and don't no how to handle situations ,usually have not had the opportunity to get thru bad times themselves, most have just bounced thru life and they are the center of everything, too bad they miss so much. They do not share themselves with anyone and often times end up alone,  The bad times make you strong and you learn to cope and you find all the gifts that you did not realize you have.  I feel very fortunate my family and friends are SOOOOOO Supportive,we had a yard sale for Breast Ca yesterday and 25 families donated stuff and we made alot of money,I am so proud of them!! We were there from 6 to 3:00, a long day in the sun, but worth it! We also had a great human interest story.  This woman about 40 walked to the Garage Sale on a busy street 3 times with a beautiful 4 yo girl, it was her daughters boyfriends child, of whom she was the primary caretaker. The grand mother kept coming and buying a few things, she was very quiet, until we noticed that she kept coming back, at the end of the sale she was there and we gave her everthing for that little girl , snow boots and snow pants, a bike with a helmet, a brass bed, books, videos and anything else she wanted, we loaded up a van and took her home. She cried and wished me good luck with my treatment and insisted we take her last$6 for BC.  We had a fit, but she wanted to contribute.  We were all breathless, we are all mothers of girls and have so much and our girls have so much! We couldn't help but admire this womans courage!  A feel good story for a Sunday pm. Much luck to all this week, we are all making progress in this journey!  Dawn",

To those of you trying to decide between a lumpectomy vs a mastectomy, there is no right or wrong answer the stats are the same for both.  Sue Love, my former college suggests breast conservation and rads!  I however had a mastectomy for my first CA, I needed to have it off, because I would have been a nut case if it came back, so I was Dx in the other breast 6 months later with no choice but a mastectomy, chemo and rads, and then who knows! reconstruction is another delemma, my first mastectomy I had a expander with an implant, and I like it ok, but it feels too big andhard, of course I have nothing but a prosthesis on the other side and I don't know what to do about that!!! My PS talked about a fat expansion , but I have to get thru rads first.  I don't like the flaps much, have assisted in Sx with those, they are a huge Sx and I 've had enough of that!

The onc and the nurses cautioned me about emotional changes, now that chemo is over. I start rads on the 20th of July! I went yesterday for mapping and a CAT scan, I now have 4 little tattos! I too won't be scanned until I have symptoms. The onc will see me Every 3 months for bld work and a physical exam. I guess the scans are too expensive, and don't really prolong your life, by early detection. I still wish they would do it! I have to find out about the cream as well for radiation, they told me yesterday they would give me some! I think I am going to hang on to my port my onc said I am high risk for recurrence, it doesn't bother me and I'll go monthly for a flush! This will never end I am afraid, I like everyone else am ready to be done!  Happy Summer it is still raining and 66 degrees in NH!  Enough!  Love, Dawn",

Every 6 weeks you have to have it flushed!I am wondering what the options are for reconstruction after rads, I hate the thoughts of a flap, way too involved! Did your friend have the fat injection, that sounds good to me,after the fat expansion do they put in an implant?? Or does the fat make up the breast? Too much to think about my PS is very good and I trust him, I'll see him in Aug, and I just want to be educated on my options!  Thanks, Dawn",

What an uplifting experience!  There are so many survivors out there. It was awesome to see people finish!  It was a 39 mile walk,sunny and 70 on Sat, and cool and drizzily on Sunday. My friends did great!  One did the whole 39 miles, she is a marathoner and works out daily, she is a mother, wife and airtraffic controller. My other friend is a little over weight and is a couch potato!  She too is a wife, and mother, president of the PTO, and Daycare provider.  They are true friends who killed themselves this weekend for me. We raised $4000. for the walk and a total of $5.4 million was raised by the 2500 walkers. Of  al the walkers my friends were in the Sunday Boston Globe!  I am so proud of these 2!Don't get discouraged about being behind, let yourself heal well before you start the poison again, this too shall pass!  Keep up the great positive attitude!  hugs, Dawn",

He talked how about how afraid he is of my dying, and what would he do with our 14yo.How mad he is that I got this DX twice, and how he can't help me! I have 3 appts this week and he is dreading them, My last chem and onc visit, my rad onc visit and an internist visit. He is unsure of our next step.  He is much better today,of course it is Father's Day and he has done as he pleased!! Maybe getting everything off his chest helped too. I hate this DX.

I am an RN and have been one for 32 years and have seen alot in that time!!! I guess maybe that makes me a skeptic!  I was first DX last July with Stage 1 node neg,oncotype 18 no chemo no rads!!!! On Dec 18 my onc told me I was cured!!!!! No need to worry, my chance after my first mastectomy, which I elected to have because I did not want to deal with this again, was almost none!!! I was so happy and relieved! Then in 1/09, I went for my red on my left and my TE removal and implant on the right and my left breast was found to have Stage 3 24/24 nodes positive! I will never let my guard down again!!!! Yes, my scans were all neg, I did my 6 rounds of TAC and my 33 rads, am I cured I don't think so!!! I wll always have to live with cancer in my life.....I am on tamoxifen for 5 years like everyone else. No SE thank heavens!!!I am working, chasing after my teenage daughter, taking care of my house and husband, everyone says I am my usual self except for being bald!!!! The hair is about 1 inch long and UGLY!!!!The wig may never go!!!My onc says to be that this TX changes a person, and I know it changed me! I now live in the minute, worry little about the future and try to enjoy the little things!  Some of this is good and some of this is bad! Like I said I have cancer and always will, but it doesn't have me!!!! that is my way of coping I guess! Hope this helps and doesn't hinder. We are all individuals, and have histories and live experiences that have gotten us to this point!  Love and Luck, My Friend!  Dawn",

So out it comes, I hung on to it for a year thinking I may need it again, but I don't need any more trouble so out it comes on the 30th.  Please don't doubt your reconstruction because of me!  I wished I had a beter result, but I think with my second Ca my whole situation changed!!!

Which we all are that is why you have to be careful about any arm or hand strains or infections.  I carry neosporin with me at all times, I am at risk as I have had a bilateral mastectomy.No one has told me about compression sleeves, I just drink alot of water and move my arms even when flying I've flown twice with no symptoms, and I have had a complete lymph node dissection on my left side.

To Those of you who don't sleep!  I am there with you!!! I think that is the worse part of this whole thing!  I feel bad for my family, if I get up, the whole house does, so I lay there and worry! This to shall pass! Hopefully my hair will last until next Thurs. 2 of the people I work with are having me shave theirs in sympathy, I think they are nuts, but the thought is wonderful! Then they will shave me!!!! To those having treatment good luck!  To those who had treatment feel better!!!! Dawn",

We have a terrible history at my house!!! We have had some one sick since my daughter was 3. She is now 14!!! We tried to keep things from her when she was little, but she always found out. She was 8 when my husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer his MD called at dinner time with the BX results, she heard the whole conversation, saw our reaction, and moved forward!!!Sometimes it is hard but the truth prevails, we always have answered her questions, and gave her time to process, not bombared her with over the top information. Now she is well schooled with cancer. She has an aunt,my mother who died of colon cancer 11/2 yrs ago, my husband ,my husbands father and me with BC twice. In her 14 years and she hates it can you blame her!  She is afraid and I am too.Just a heads up!! There is also anger sometimes if they aren't told!!! My daughter has been there!!!!

Thurs, with my surgeon to schedule my left mastectomy and axillary node bx.Then radiation and chemo.

That makes me crazy that in this day in age doctors make decisions for patients that are at their most vulnerable state!  Can you tell my IRISH is up! Yes, your lymph node status is why they want to give you chemo, they want to kill as much as they can befor they remove anything.  That is smart, but don't let them decide for you!!!!! Honestly, I have no regrets about my mastectomy and expander.  Yes, it would have been nice to keep my own breast, but I always would think something would come back and if it did, I would be sorry that I didn't go for the mastectomy.  The expander is not that bad, it feels weird but I do have a bump where my scare is and I have great confidence in my PS to build me another.

So I opted for an expander with exchange planned in Jan. The expander feels wierd, but I function well with the help of tylenol, before and after fills. Good Luck! Dawn",

It really wasn't a pain but a muscle spasm.  My docs think it is from assymetry!  I have one side reconstructed only and probably will have that implant removed in the spring so I will be symmetrical!!! The myofacial release is just a laying on of the hands that releases the fascia between the muscles that were damaged during surgery and rads.  Very soothing and effective!!! Dawn",

There is nothing anyone can say to make you feel better.  It is a terrible time in your life.  The only comfort I can give you is to read as much as you can stand, then exhaust yourself and put it all into perspective after you wake up! I had a mastectomy,expanders and will have an exchange in Jan.  I have ben scared to death, depressed,and realistic during this whole procedure.  I tried to remain as opened minded as I could be and listen to the MD's. Fortunately I have lucked out and need no further treatment. I wish you all of Thanksgivings Blessings,Find all the strength you have, and put this chapter behind you!!! Best Wishes Dawn",

I started wearing a bra with prosthesis 24/7 and it helped. I am an RN whose BF is a PT. I talked to her about my pain and she suggested myofascial release. It is wonderful. I started in Nov, and now sleep thru the night and I am much more flexible than I was before Pt my flexion in my left arm is almost perfect, I gained 15 degrees!! I have taken no muscle relaxants or pain pills, I do my stretching and will continue Pt weekly. Ask your MD's about this.  It helped me!  good Luck, Dawn",

You need to be seen! After you talk to them call your PCP and get a referral.  The nurses will help you and be your advocate. Just keep going after it and you will get results. Unfortunately, the schedulers do not always understand the situation. Good Luck, Dawn",

I've worked all shifts, been on call, and have had plenty of stress! Would I change any of it, I doubt it! I am happily married with a teenage daughter, now I work part-time,as an RN, doing cataract surgery. I went back 3 weeks after my mastectomy! I think living a full life and doing what makes you happy is the answer, who knows why we ended up here, we can't change it anyway. Find a place where you have peace of mind and go forward!  My best to all-",

It was just enough to see everyone and get use to the pace. This is my 4th week back and I will start 8 hour shifts next week! I think I am ready! It takes time to feel like you can move, and your endourance, to return.  Talk to your boss!  See what your benefits are.  Take care of you!! Good Luck! Dawn",
