In addition would you want me to have my doctor to send you my medical records?  I have a huge big file, and been in and out of hospital for almost last 10 months, everyday just this year.  I have not even told you about my first experience with cancer (cervical cancer) back in 2006.  So please let me know which cancer file do you need. Frankly, speaking I though most of people with cancer would be more sympathetic with others of similar diagnosed, but I guess I was wrong.    Revricki, The direction on the package says 45 minutes two to three times a week.  I do not know who said twice a day?   Chelev, I have find hard to believe that anybody who has gone through cancer diagnose and treatments make fun of others who have gone through similar diagnosis, I just shared my experience and give a suggestion, again I though most of people with cancer would be more sympathetic with others of similar diagnosed.  And it was nice to know you all.",

I am still on Herceptin.   I remember my doctor told me it is going to be long \"haul,\" and he was right it had been long \"haul\", and I am slowly coming along.  I have to tell you that now, I cannot brag enough about my hair. ",
