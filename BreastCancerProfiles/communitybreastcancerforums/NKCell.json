      "Content": "NKCell wrote: Hello, This is my first time posting. I  am Stage IV with bone mets, have been on anti-estrogen therapy since my diagnosis a little more than a year ago, as recommended by doctors I consulted at Sloan-Kettering, Dana Farber, St. Vincents, NYU, and Weill-Cornell. But the cancer has grown and there is now lymph node involvement. My oncologist at NYU recommended Xeloda, a relatively nontoxic chemotherapy. However, I also consulted a Dr. William Grace (affiliated with Lenox Hill) for a second opinion, and he is an outlier. He disapproves of my treatment so far and recommends treatment based on results of chemosensitivity assays (cell-death assays, not the molecular growth assays, he is quick to emphasize) from the Rational Therapeutics lab founded by Dr. Robert Nagourney. He says I can be cured (whereas mainstream oncology considers Stage IV incurable) and wants to biopsy breast tumor & give me systemic chemo based on the assay, and then either a mastectomy or (if I don't want a mastectomy), chemo to my mammary and axillary arteries and radiation. He says he's never had a patient recurrence with these assays and that it's unethical not to use them. He claims no financial ties to the assay tests. So I'm wondering if anyone on this board has received chemotherapy treatment based on cell-death (apoptosis) assays, and what your assessment is based on personal experience. Thank you in advance.

I wonder why your tumor cells would develop resistance to drugs other than AC when that was the only drug you were taking? That doesn't seem to make sense! How does your doctor/the lab explain it?  Also, have you met others who have used the Rational Therapeutics assays?  Again, thanks immeasurably for sharing.",

My doctors at NYU and Dana Farber think there is not enough evidence that it is worthwhile but Dr. Grace says that the assays most doctors are familiar with are the unreliable molecular cell-growth assays, whereas the cell-death (apoptosis) assays from Rational Therapeutics are far more reliable. They are expensive and not covered so I hope to make an informed decision!",

Most oncologists say the evidence isn't there, but a small group of oncologist and other doctors swear by it. The first doctor I heard about it from was Pamela Yee at the Center for Health and Healing (NY)--not an oncologist. She referred me to Dr. Grace.  The lab website is here: www.rational-t.com/",
