My Oncologist told me today that she may put me on an AI instead of Tamoxifen since I haven't had a period for almost one year now. What SE's did you experience on Arimidex? I am most concerned about joint pain and weight gain. I am still experiencing some joint pain from the chemo, last treatment Dec. 16,2011. I also exercise most days, usually hiking as I still can't figure out what to wear to the gym since I still don't have hair! Any suggestions? Also, coming to Palm Desert to celebrate the end of radiation and to watch some of the tennis at Indian Wells! Thanks for your inspiration as I'm a little worried transitioning into my non-treatment phase. Any good organic restaurants there? Laurie",
