I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m almost done.... for the most part I handled both DD AC and Taxol as well as can be expected, however there is something about the 3rd treatments of each that they were much harder than all the others...I have needed much more recovery time after The 3rd rounds. It has me nervous as I am due to go back to work full time 6 days after my last treatment...does anyone know if it\u2019s possible for me to get a normal dose of taxol opposed to the dose dense for my last treatment? Would this have less side effects and would it make that much of a difference as far as treatment goes? I was going to ask my MO about it. THanks :)",

I've beem really depressed. I have so much coming up in the next 3 months. Also, I had no lymph node involvement and clear margins, so I'm not having radiation. Where I was \u201cclear\" will I get chemo through a port or through ivadministration? Just curious. I'm guessing I'll start within the next 2 weeks or so. Thanks all (",

My mind is everywhere. Theoretically I am cancer free as my mastectomy surgery showed clear margins and no lymph node involvement. I start chemo on 5/17. I just feel so down, and I should probably feel gratful. Every task is huge to me. I just want to feel positive while I move forward. I know everyone reacts differently. I just hate how I feel. Always worried and anxious. Thanks for letting me vent .",

I will say my hair definitely started shedding a lot after treatment 2. I had it buzzed today which is actually a loy easier to deal with. The hairdresser was so kind. I got a bit emotioal, and she gave me a much needed hug! Here\u2019s to hoping I feel be better tomorrw!!",

The plan is to be done after that! Fingers crossed!! Thanks",

I have small breasts to begin with and I can always go back for the reconstruction if I choose. I just needed to get back to life ASAP as a single Mom and supporter of my family. So I had to choose the shortest recovery time. the surgery and recovery up until recently had been no issues, I felt right on track. My scar area was never \u201cflat\u201d. I figured maybe some swelling? At my 2 week post op I was told I have a large hematoma under the skin where my breast was removed. It honestly looks like I have an Implant! Very discouraging, as the surgeon is suggesting leaving it alone and letting nature take its course allowing the body to reabsorb it. This can take weeks to months! I\u2019ve read some get them surgically removed, or even drained. It is not painful, but is uncomfortable. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t get any bigger, as there isn\u2019t much more room. THat makes me nervous. It is keeping me from wanting to do things .Any similar stories, or advice very welcome!!! Thanks so much!!",
