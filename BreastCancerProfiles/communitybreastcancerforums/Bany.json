She is not ready to go back into hospice, and is really trying get healthy and infection free. Today, however, she felt crappy again and was concerned that maybe she still had an infection and needed a stronger antibiotic. She is not getting on her computer much these days, but I let her know that you all are thinking of her and asking about her.  Angela sends love, as always!  Please keep her in your prayers.   Bethany ",

She was in terrible pain in her kidney, and feeling weak and generally like crap. She had an ambulance ride to ER and was admitted.  They will replace her nephrostomy tubes and get a clean catch of the urine at that time. She is getting IV antibiotics and pain meds, so she is more comfortable. She is currently not getting any cancer treatment because her blood counts are just too low. She seems to have an infection that just won't quit. I hope they can figure out why her kidneys are bleeding, and that she can get well and home in time for Thanksgiving with her family!! Just letting you know so you can send love and prayers to Angela!! I told Angela that you've been asking about her, and that made her smile. Bethany",

Not so good news: They did a CT scan of her kidneys and discovered that there was a piece the stent (which she had removed five months ago) still in her kidney. Now we know why ALL the infections. All the infections which have prevented her from getting chemo (low blood counts). I am so mad!! Stupid people!! Didn't they even look at the stent when it was removed? Didn't they wonder where the missing piece was!!??? Angela will need to have surgery to remove it. GRRRRR! BEST NEWS!! Today is Angela's Birthday!!!!!

She's hanging in there.   I don't know when she last posted here, but after Disney, she was able to get Medicaid and had scans done.  The good news is that although there was progression in her bones, there were no mets anywhere else.  That is awesome and amazing considering she had no treatment for 6 months.   She had one round of chemo, which was rough on her, and she had rads for her spine, which helped the pain some, but she couldn't complete it due to burning esophogus and stomach. Some of her other bone mets are very painful, and she is having troubles with nausea and vomiting. So, she's not feeling all that great, (good days and bad days) but she is still with us and fighting to be here!! I talk to her a lot (and yes, Luann, it's very hard to get her on the phone, you just have to be persistent!), and try to visit when I can.  When she's feeling like this, she doesn't get on the computer much.  Not posting much, and not checking emails.  NEWSFLASH!  I just called over there to see if Angela wanted me to tell you anything (before I finished this post).  Got her husband.  She has been in and out of the hospital over the last month.  Infections, and low potassium, also the vomiting. SHe is going to meet with her oncologist this afternoon, and her husband will call me with any updates.  If there is more news, I'll come back and post.   I hope to speak with her tonight or tomorrow and will elt her know that she's in your thoughts and prayers!! Oh, and if anyone would like to send her a card, send me PM, and I'll give you her address!! I know that cards really cheer her up!! Blessings, Bethany   6:20 pm (mountain time). The doctors went back and forth and decided not to keep her at the hospital, but sent her home with antibiotics and no help or answers. They didn't hydrate her, just sent her home. She's glad not to be in the hospital, but bummed to still be feeling so sick. She's feeling down too. She wants to get back to treatment, and she's still hanging out in limbo-land and feeling like crap. She sees her onc later this week. I hope they come up with a plan and that she can get some relief. B. [Loving my girl, Angela! And 8 years dancing with my main man NED!!",

I was so scared since I have not heard a word since I saw her Saturday!! She sounded like herself, and we talked for a long time. Here's the latest: Angela was moved to a Hospice Saturday night. She started to feel a bit better Sunday. She is still having headache pain from the brain mets, but meds are helping some. Seems the nausea is under control. She will be going home tomorrow (Tuesday), with hospice care and her friend, who is a nurse will be with her 24 hours a day. That will be easier for her and her family in many ways. They can all be with her round the clock. I think we may have more time on earth with our sweet Angela!! Angela asked me to give you all a message: She wishes she could come online and tell you herself. You all mean so much to her and all have been such a blessing. She wants to thank you for your love, support, cards and prayers. And to thank you for making her Disney Dream come true. She said it was perfect. She felt well enough to enjoy it, and make those family memories. She says she can't thank you enough! And I second that!! I do believe that her prayers (and YOURS) have been answered that she has a bit more time with her family and loved ones. I really thought she might die this weekend. I am glad it was a thought and not a reality. Thanks for the love and prayers!   I'll keep you posted! xo Bethany (with a Sigh, of relief)",
