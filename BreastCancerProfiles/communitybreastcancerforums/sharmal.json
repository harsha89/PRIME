The disease is recurred after 7 years of gap from Stage II. she has completed 6 cycles of Palbociclib (125 mg) + Femara this month and now after PET Scan (June) report, Onc. has switched her on new medicine (Navelbine 50 mg IV ) with Carboplatin 450 mg. Apart from that, she is on monthly shot of Zoldonat 4 mg also, which will be continue going forward too. I want to know what are the side effects of Navelbine, are these tolerable?? My mom is 62 years old. She has tremendous will power. I am also worried that Dr. has suggested to plant a port to vein for Navelbine chemo. is it necessary for it?? I have read here that Navelbine is also available in Oral form. But not sure if it is available in India. With best wishes and blessing, Lalit. Log in to post a reply",

The onc has suggested Faslodex (500mg) injection along with Zoldonet (zoldronic acid). I had discussed the issues which my mom is facing. About bloated stomach, he said it is due to gas/constipation as there is no fluid accumulation visible in abdominal ultrasound. Although there is mild pleural effusion in left side but he did not find it so much concerning.   ",

I have been passive participant of this thread since my mom's MBC has progressed to liver 4 months back. Today i am posting to enquire and seek guidance for my mom's treatment. My mom is 62 years old and first diagnosed with disease in 2nd Stage in year 2007. That time it was detected as TNBC (2007). Cancer had recurred in metastate in Sept, 2015. And it was ER-PR positive (20%) and her2 negative.That time it was discovered to lung and multiple bones. Till now she had been on various oral and chemo medicines (Taxol -2007) (Cytogem, Carboplatin, zoldonet, pegasta, megastty, femara, palbace, navelbine). In last few PET scans, disease was reported progressive. In Feb, this month, the disease was progressed to Liver (measure RL- 17 x 18 mm, Lt- 16 x 24 mm) with no sign of pleural effusion in ultrasound of abdominal. That time, our ONC has decided to try the disease for TNBC and suggested 3 cycles of Halaven. Last month my mom has completed 3rd cycle of Halaven. Since last few weeks, she has been complaining about bloated stomach and have measure constipation. She feels shortness of breath and get tired with few mins walk. We did ultrasound of abdominal today, as we have scheduled ONC visit on this friday. The ultrasound report is not at all good. The disease seems to be progressed in Liver as new measures are (RL-26x 23 mm & LT-30 x 28 mm) with presence of pleural effusion in left side. It look like that Halaven did not really work for my mom ?? As a family, we all are feeling down today but we are still hopeful and want to fight with this till end with my mom. Thank you so much for all your time to read this long post. Prayers and hope for everyone.",

The disease is in lungs and 4 months back it was in liver too. In last 2 months the disease showed progression in liver. We have done liver biopsy. The results is ER >95 % strongly positive, PR is weakly 5% positive and cerb B2 is negative. We have scheduled onc visit today. Since last 2 months, my mom gets very tired just walking few steps ..The same happened while getting up from bed and chair as well. Her stomach is bloated...Although she is regular with her diet. She gets swollwing in her legs and feet. She breath heavily and fast during sleep. I can hear it. Her hgb is around 8 at present...She gets blood transfusion in between therapies. Is this fatigue due to low blood count? She had low blood count in past too but this time she is very down as compare to past. Thanks you so much again for your valuable comments and suggestions. Hope and prayers for all. Lalit.   ",

She has little improvement in terms of back & abdominal pain. But as you know this journey is roaler coaster ride, a week before she has developed pain in one of leg so currently facing issue in free movement. She has extensive bone mats. We are waiting for CT scane report to get clear detail about this. Halaven was not so tough as compare to other chemo s yet I think, it's too early to find the impact. She has lost almost all her hair. My best wishes and prayers for your mom.    ",
