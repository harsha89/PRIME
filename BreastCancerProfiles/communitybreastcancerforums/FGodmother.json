So far, I am not noticing a lot of color change, but my nipple areola has taken on a weird shape on the bottom (anyone else have this happen?), and the skin and nipple are tender. I have been slathering vitamin e oil after treatment, and once more during the day, then before bed. I am now to the point where a bra feels uncomfortable, so I am wearing a cotton tank top under a loose and flowy blouse. I am so thankful that the \"rock\" deodorant seems to be doing its job. My two biggest fears going into rads were not being able to control underarm odor without my usual deodorant, and not being able to wear a bra in my heavily male work environment. Now I am mainly concerned about the fatigue and skin damage at the very end and post rads. I have learned that there is always something that is going to be a worry or bother with BC treatment, and to just take it as it comes, hoping for the best and being prepared for the worst. Enjoy this weekend break, free from the zaps.",

Because I am having my left breast radiated, I had to be sure by inhaling deeply that my heart would move out of the way. I was able to pass the test, so I am having the hypofractionated (Canadian protocol) shorter course for 16 WBI and 4 boosts. I begin next Thursday, the 16th. Hypofractionated is double the strength of the usual protocol, so can be completed in half the time. There is an article here on BCO that mentions patients have fewer SEs with the shorter course. I am sure hoping so!",
