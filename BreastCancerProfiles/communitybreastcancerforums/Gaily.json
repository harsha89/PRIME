She told me to take evening primrose oil and painkillers everyday to see if that helps, I even said that i would pay for a mammogram but she said would do me more harm than good, surely something is causing these symptoms, should i just accept her word and stop worring or go private for a mammogram?",

I hope all goes well for you and i will update any changes, take care",

There is loads of people on here that never felt a lump so i dont know how she can assure me that nothing is wrong. Thanks again for your reply and i'll let you know how i get on ",
