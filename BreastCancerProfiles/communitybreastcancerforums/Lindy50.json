Last June my oncologist told me that I was NED (hooray!) and that I could stop taking Xeloda because it was probably the Herceptin that's controlling the cancer. Stopping chemo sounds great but the 'probably' has me concerned. He hasn't presented me with any concrete evidence other than this is working on a few of his patients. Has anyone experienced this? This is causing me a great deal of stress and I'm not sure what to do. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
