But I wanted to ask questions because my mom was diagnosed today. She's waiting for the call to schedule the surgery. My mother has extremely dense breast. When they counted the sists in her breast they stopped at 102. It's bad. Well come to find out she has a tumor.During the mamogram she had to got through the procedure 10 times, instead of 2, to find the marker. She's in a lot of pain. She's so independant she barely shows shes in pain when I'm around. I wanna help her as much as I can. So please, what can I do to help her? Anyway shape or form. I wanna support her 100% and show her that I am. Help? Thanks. - Chantel Log in to post a reply",
