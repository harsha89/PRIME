So many people on this whole site research, research, and research; plus spout off more info than I ever imagined. It's to educate and to share and does a world of good most of the time. I do my share of research and then talk to someone that knows about the research, etc. After that, we are all still looking at the same questions that don't always have any answers. And even if they do have answers, as patients we don't really believe them. So, we do the best we can with what answers we do have and continue to search for better answers, and for better research. BosumBlues (hello again!) and redheaded1, anyone can see you both are trying so hard. I needed to lose 40 pounds before I was DX with this stupid disease and that was last November. Now, I understand it's going to be even harder. I should have been eating healthier my whole life and if I had known that it would have prevented cancer then, duh, I would have. Of course, if that were the solution to getting cancer then no one would have cancer because we'd just eat our fish and greens and be healthy.  Don't beat yourself up so much. Yes, as cancer patients, we have to take better care of ourselves. But, it's not going to happen overnight. A day at a time. I wouldn't be saying anything tonight but when I read your posts it made me realize how tough we are on ourselves. Every little detail in our lives has changed. Must everything, other than our cancer, change all at once? Believe it or not, my neurologist found I had no B vitamins hardly left in my body, much less Vit D! So, why the heck was my PCP or why didn't my new MO do that testing right away? Doctors can be so stupid to be so smart. My neurologist was running bloodwork last month to check on an old issue.  So, if you haven't gotten that bloodwork done, tell someone to make sure they are checking your vitamin levels, thyroid, and anything else you might have read or seen on here that could help you feel better. I was taking B12 injections once a day for a week, then once a week for a month and now once a month indefinitely because my levels were so bad. Vitamin D prescriptions go from 50K starting and then leveling. All of this has to be medically supervised. Don't just start buying vitamins and guessing at what to take because someone else says so. All of my supplements are now closely monitored and they are called into the pharmacy so there can be no mistake. If there is anything else I hear about or want to try I ask more than one or two people, read about it, keep asking, see if it's gonna do more harm than good, before I buy it. Just take care of yourself. Be kinder to YOU. Try to mix things up with your food...take a cooking class. I hate to cook but I'm thinking about taking one. I'm getting stiffer everyday since my exchange surgery so I know I have to move around more. If you force yourself too much it will be miserable and if you don't do enough you'll be miserable. So find that in-between place for now. I don't know where it is all the time. Some days I can eat an apple and somedays not. If it's a veggie, I want it fried. So, I'm struggling there. I don't want a smoothie - a texture thing, and I dislike yogurt, so I'm really screwed. But, I'll still try to think of something for the next day. You won't be perfect. Just get to a place that you feel you are helping yourself as much as you can, not as much as you should, as much as you can. That is where we get lost and very frustrated. I'll probably gain another 5 pounds soon but I hope you don't! But, don't give up and someday you'll have to help me!",

So, yeah I get all that but I can't imagine going through this with that happening. I hated having to ask for help but know it's temporary, whether it's money or getting someone to help you with whatever, it will work out. Not with this jerk but once the paperwork is done that will be one less thing to mess with. Unfortunately, my grandkids live in NE Oklahoma. No way my DSIL would let me live too close to my DD!

Warning, I'm going off on a tangent here...some of you that know me won't be surprised! But no one please take offense!  It's just that good health or bad health doesn't seem to be the catalyst. Just look around...1000# people? skinny people? organic food, junk food, used to be no eggs, now you can have eggs...only thing I believe is a factor are pesticides. Of course, the use of plastic materials has not helped but I've nuked my share of them!  I have a close family member with terminal lung cancer, healthy, non-smoker, very strict in what he eats, all that was so he would never get seriously ill. Didn't help.  But, I see another family member that weighs 300 lbs and she's never eaten a healthy item in her life yet, no cancer in her. Heck, she never had a pap on a regular basis and no mammograms until she turned 60. No cancer in our family line yet one of us has cancer and it happens to be me! The other victim is not blood related. He has no cancer in his family either. So, while some of our testing is based on genetics, how reliable can it be? I have no idea, mainly because I'm not a geneticist and I don't think they know for sure themselves. If they did, there would not be a disclaimer on our results. Which test, which doctor, which opinion and which drug drives us all to the point of not knowing what to believe. What causes one woman to survive indefinitely and another live only a few years, both with the same DX, same treatments, all the same? Now here we stand, still asking the same questions. We have more drugs, more tests but not more answers. Even doctors can't agree, researchers can't agree on the data even though they are looking at the same data. Plus, there isn't enough data on anything. One says chemo, one says rads, one says tamox, one says AIs, one says doesn't matter. Two or three opinions and they can all be different. They don't even know if it's 5 yrs or 10 yrs....that's changing daily now. So, what's left? Ourselves. Just us. Trying to wander thru this mess with only our DX and our gut feeling to get us through. You can't compare. If you do, you will make it worse trying to figure out if your treatment was the right one or not. A few weeks back, I saw on here where a lady died of BC. According to her bio, she was a Stage 1.  All of a sudden, she was so ill from all the complications you could imagine. I became fixated on reading back and back as far as I could go to find out how this could start and it seemed to just happen. Well, that scared the chit out of me. Especially since my MO said it didn't matter if I take an AI or not, my risk was very low. So, what the heck does he know? His partner might have told me to do something else. But, I'm doing what he said. Is he right? I hope so cause if not I'm checking out earlier than I should have to.",

I'm learning to do the best I can, move forward and make decisions that I think are the right ones for my body. I have to live with all the unknown and questions, we all do. I'm sure the pressure is on many researchers because of groups like BCO and women that are organized and making loud noises. For that reason, we should all continue our quest whether it is color based or not (pink groups), it shows our strength in numbers and that's worth me wearing some silly hat or whatever, going to a luncheon to raise funds, or being here to learn about other sites. We all owe that to this disease, to not be quiet, to do anything it takes to beat it, even if we have to do crazy things to make those \"experts\" work harder. I like we can gather up and say \"what the heck?\" We need answers. I like that we can challenge our medical teams. It shows that we won't be complacent about our healthcare. Plus, it drives them crazy 'cause most dislike educated patients. And BCO is one tool to help us educate. Okay, I can stop now. But, I hope you all keep talking to your doctors.
