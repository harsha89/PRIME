I recommend a sleep aid, Ativan, to ease your anxiety and to allow you to get some rest.  In those initial days and weeks I was so scared I would awaken at night literally trembling with fear.  A friend recommended Ativan and my onc was in complete agreement.  It was helpful then and throughout chemo. As you learn more about your individual circumstances I recommend learning everything you can about your pathology.  Thank God for the internet.  This site is one of many with very knowledgable women to help you walk down this new path in your life. I know young women can and do have children post breast cancer treatment depending on their individual disease pathology.  Your onc will guide you. You'll live to fight many, many more years, I am certain.  Fight with everything you can and hit it as hard as you can this first opportunity.  Consider supplementing conventional treatments with naturalpathy.  Most of us use supplements.  A good site to begin exploring naturalpathy is the Annie Appleseed Project, just google it. I have endured 8 rounds of chemo, months of Herceptin infusions and bilateral mastectomies with reconstruction, and it all still feels like a dream, correction, nightmare.  You will feel stronger as time passes.  Don't hesitate to ask for prayer.  No time to be superwoman! You will be on my prayer list! ",
