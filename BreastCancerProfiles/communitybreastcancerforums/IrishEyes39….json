Since it can't penetrate the TE, it won't be able to go any deeper and can only grow in other directions (or through my skin). Thanks!",

I've always been confused by US measurement (which one is length, height, and whatever the third means). In my case this time, they are less important because the mass is stuck between my skin and TEs and the BS said it may not be able to grow as it naturally would without any tissue to grow into. But still, I'm curious. Maybe someone here knows how to read it? Last month it measured 1.1 cm × 1.4 cm x 0.4 cm Friday it measured 1.2 cm × 1.4 cm x 0.5 cm I know the slight changes probably mean nothing other than slightly different angles when measuring. HELP?

Just got pathology results, but HER2 is +2 so waiting on additional tests to determine if I'll need chemo. For those about to have surgery, my experience: Pain is manageable after the first day or two. It is not as bad as I feared. The breasts themselves are numb, so the incision area doesn't really hurt. I'm pretty sure most of my pain is from the TEs and under my arm where a lymph node was removed. Take your meds BEFORE the pain gets bad. It seems much easier to prevent it from getting bad than to stop it once it takes hold. SO easily fatigued with activity and even after talking for more than a minute... Not sure if that is the trauma from the surgery or from the TEs or just because I have asthma. Right now, this is my biggest obstacle. I HATE the drains and will beg for their removal when I see the surgeons tomorrow. For those of you who have already had drains removed: How badly does it hurt?",

Once the drains are out, you will be much more comfortable. I found they not only caused localized pain/burning, but they also made me sit and and sleep in strange positions, worsening muscle spasms and tightness. The muscle relaxers at full dose are making me feel sick, so I will try a Valium today since you guys have recommended it. Chest tightness and underarm pain from lymph node removal are my only sources of pain now. And the Percocet makes me itch too. :(",
