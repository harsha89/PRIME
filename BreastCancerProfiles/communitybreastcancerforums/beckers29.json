      "Content": "beckers29 wrote: I'm 29 years old and I have two lumps in my right breast. One of these is approximately 5cm in diameter, while the other one is about 2.5cm. The larger mass had a core biopsy to confirm that it's a fibroadenoma, the smaller one is more recent and has only had an ultrasound with the diagnosis of \"probably benign\". The smaller one has been growing though, so I've been referred to a breast surgeon. The larger one is on the \"top\" of my breast, while the smaller one is on the underside of my breast. I think I also found a new one last night in my left breast, but it's hard and flat and feels totally different, so until my doctor's appointment I'm just going to pretend it doesn't exist! What freaks me out is not knowing what is likely to happen. If I get lumpectomies performed, probably around 30-40% of the tissue in my right breast would be removed. If that happens, wouldn't it be obvious and disfiguring with reconstructive surgery? Plus, fibroadenomas could keep forming in the remaining tissue-- so is a mastectomy recommended in that situation then? If anyone has experience with this sort of thing, I'd really appreciate some knowledge about how this sort of situation is dealt with! Thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",
