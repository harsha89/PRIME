Just FYI my RO's nurse (who insisted initially that nausea was NOT normal) called my super smart Oncologist who said it has been a complaint of her patients so I felt validated! I finished yesterday. I know I should be excited but I'm nervous for the future which I know is very normal. After perfect skin it just started to get super red, and very very dark in axilla area. Yuk. I was given Silvadene. Does anyone know when it should get better or the trajectory? And finally - my ribs on my radiated side are tender? Anyone else have this? Thank you in advance for being such a lovely group. It's invaluable.",

I am so nauseated all day long and RO insists its not from radiation but I feel it is. It's like morning sickness - all day queasiness. I wanted to cry when I met with the nurse today because if it's no radiation induced then what is this? I'm just hoping for it to get better.     ",

After all of the other crap I guess I figured this would be like a trip to the tanning salon! Not so. But it's so annoying how the RO nurse looks at me like a nut when I describe feeling lousy. They keep saying that the nausea cannot be due to radiation but I just don't understand how it can't be?! After all aren't cells being killed/traumatized? Wouldn't the body give pushback in some form? It scares me that something more is cooking and my hope is that it's just this portion and will go away.",
