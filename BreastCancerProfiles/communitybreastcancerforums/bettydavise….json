Dr. James Forsythe.  I called a place in Arizona, but I can't remember the name of it. If you have any referrals for me to check out that would be wonderful.  The place in Arizona that I called I wasn't thrilled with.  A doc called me back but he sounded so depressed and had no energy whatsoever.  Next!  So any referrals would be great as I am going to get more than one opinion.",

Contreras to be a wealth of information and care regarding cancer.  The man could move ountains, but his heart is obviously not in the right place.  I am so sorry for what your brother and family had to go through.  In any case, I found an excellent breast surgeon in La Jolla, Ca.  She has done me so well.  I have had two surgeries. I have had my left breast removed, and I had a second surgery to remove more lymph nodes.  It is is said I am cancer free.  I start chemo in two weeks.  I am recovering well, and I am very happy with my treatment plan so far. I may do reconstruction at a later date.  Not sure yet.  I am going to have the right breast removed sometime in the next six months.  I suppose after that I will decide.  Right now I have' flat' and a 'C' cup.  I will need to determine how it feels to be 'even'.  I think I will probably choose to not have reconstruction. but that is something I can't comment on right now cuz I am not there yet.   As far as my surgeon and oncology team, these are the best, most well rounded docs I have known.  they offer state of the art everything.  The very most current up to date treatments, and they are so kind.  So, I am happy to give her name if anyone is looking for a stellar doctor.  That said,  I totally agree with you regarding Oasis.  I couldn't get them to call me back.  They gave me a fee amount just to start the treatment whatever that treatment would be.  I asked them if I needed to pay that in totality at onset of care of if we could make payments.  They never responded to that email.  I called and tried to talk to someone about this issue and never got a return call. If these things are true that are said about Oasis, then it is very sad.  As I stated before, Dr. contreras is gifted.  There is no doubt about that.  His father was gifted.  But his father also had a huge heart to help people.  I wish I could say I believed it to be the same for his son. I believe the father ran the operation differently, and I don't believe those same ethics, belief and heart now reign at Oasis.",
