Any ladies here have focal asymmetry turn out to be benign?  I have another week to wait before I see the breast surgeon.  This waiting is killing me. Kristin Log in to post a reply",

I have been told that it is not uncommon to have a biopsy come back without definitive answers, but that does not help the way that I feel.  I too have had to wait for three weeks after the first biopsy to have a consult with a surgeon (at a totally new facility). The biopsy that was done in the wrong area came back B9 and I was told be the facility that I could not have another stereotactic done there as the table they use(which is brought in to the hospital every two weeks) will not accommodate the location that I need to have the second biopsy to be completed. I'm waiting to see what happens at the surgical consult to see what my situation is before I consider action against this small hospital. My thoughts are with you. Kristin",
