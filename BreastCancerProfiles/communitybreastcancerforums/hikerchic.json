I'm on the same roller coaster having received my diagnosis today...high grade IDC, ER/PR positive, with one lymph node biopsy also positive. My HER2 is pending. I'm 45 and 13 weeks pregnant, so chemo and surgery are my only options at this time. Due to the pregnancy, everything is moving really fast. Once you meet with the surgeon and MO, you will feel better. It gives an odd sense of control. Everyone here is wonderful...and so supportive. We have each other and there is strength in numbers.",
