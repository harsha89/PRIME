Nerve pain and swelling...ouch. Anyway, I am just 5.5 weeks PFC. Couldn't really reach the showerhead to pull it off, bend over, and use cold water on my hair after surgery, so last week I used lukewarm water to rinse my hair. While standing upright. From the showerhead! Seriously, I cannot wait to blast my head with hot, hot water, I miss it so much. soon, though! I haven't had much shedding post pregnancy or PFC. Wondering if surgery will do it, but so far so good. I am really going this week to get my hair cut. Probably like 1-2 inches only, and a dry cut, or I'll wash it myself at home, then walk down to the fancy salon. My eyebrows looked like I tried unsuccessfully to shave them off. What happened? Little stupid eyebrow hairs, how could you leave me. I still have the arch and long part, it just the thicker part of the beginning of the brow that thinned. Easy to fill in, but look so Cancer-y in the mornings. I feel like I look like I've really aged. I want to laser my face, get Botox, get my hair bleached, get my nails done, etc, but I'm still holding off. Going back in for a dirty margin in mid May, I'll treat myself to the rest maybe after that. Keep posting ladies, I'll post an after cut photo here soon. Hugs",

I am two weeks post op. In that time, my surgeon has given me three dexamethasone shots in the ribs under the arm. She feels around for the spot that is super painful, injects, and send me on my way. It has reduced the pain dramatically. The last time, two days ago, she used an ultrasound at the same time to see the neuroma and inject right near it. I have also started taking neurontin, which I think has helped, allowing me to reduce pain meds. I am being treated at UC San Francisco. Seeif youR Breast surgeon would do this for you. Good luck!",

This whole thing just sucks.  Yes I do have another set of twins, two girls, almost 2.5 y.o., but I think that after six rounds of AC, we may do a lumpectomy at 31 weeks, then start up with more chemo after delivery, then maybe radiation. My doc said it will be a long 12-14 months. I got more path info last night, ER+, PR+, HER 2-, grade 2 just like my mothers stage 1 at 73 y.o. I have stage 2, but we won't do a node excision now, so I guess we will never really definitively stage it at the outset. Yet having more info still feels better than the terror of just knowing it's cancer without type, stage, aggressiveness, etc.  I am fixated on the hair loss right now, and feel stupid about it when there are two babies at stake. My friend says that contemplating something happening to the babies is too emotionally difficult, so I focus on my hair instead. Who knows? I like my hair and eyebrows.  I do know that I have stopped thinking about decorating the nursery for now, and just want to focus on my independently living children, and me. We were going for five kids total, but now it looks like that won't happen.  I'm not sure how badly I'll react to the chemo, but wanted the kids with me at home (instead of our house farther away from the city) My mother thinks it's a bad idea, but I feel it's important to be able to see them, hug them, hear them and focus on the future instead of laying in bed with no one around. What was your experience? Did kids around make it better to focus on something positive, even though you felt awful?  I don't know those specific docs at CPMC, but that is a great center. How is your treatment going in NC compared with here? Is there a med school there?  Thanks for the comforting words, I'll cross my fingers we all make it through. I could easily be run over by a cable car tomorrow, so you really never know. Hugs.",
