The pain was becoming manageable -- that is until I has my drains removed last Thursday 8/27. It was horrible, but the next day.... I wanted to report a hit and run of the truck that ran me over. Felt like I regressed. As the day wears on I feel worse..barely any sleep. Just wanted to know what I'm facing now that I'm at the point of getting the fills. Any suggestions, comments etc would totally rock! Thanks! Dx 7/2015, DCIS, Right, Stage 0, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR- Log in to post a reply",
