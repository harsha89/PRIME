I'm sorry that you are dealing with these symptoms and I hope that you'll soon get better. Unfortunately I have no information about the procedure you talk about, but maybe there is somoeone else on this board that can help you. Dear Sandilee, SUV stands for standard uptake value and it's a value you get when you have a PET scan. It should indicate metabolic activity of the mets, though I have no idea about the values (what is considered high? and what is low?). Prayers for you all.",

Four mets were taken away and she was left with three small mets.

In 2009 she was ER + PR - HER2 + and her liver biopsy had the same result, while the biopsy of the mets resected was ER + PR - HER -. Now the onc told her that she has to do chemo again, but they don't know which kind of... I still wonder why they decided to give her only Kadcyla, since she has become HER2-. I'm so worried and scared. Is there any of you who could share their own experiece, if similar? I really need some encouragement.

I don't know exactly when she's going to have a scan but the docs want to start chemo in ten days without waiting for a scan in order to stop whatever is going on as soon as possible and in the meanwhile they are going to plan a scan. I really do hope that this new chemo will help in getting rid of her three small liver mets and stop whatever is going on anywhere else. As far as it concerns my mum's liver mets, the docs haven't told her to stop eating anything in particular. Just not to eat a lot of fried food or too many sweets. Mum's mets have always been asymptomatic (and I hope they're going to stay asymptomatic in they have to stay there) and her blood test never showed anything at all, so I can't help you about that. I hope that scan and meet with the onc will bring you some good news. Prayers for you and all your family. ",

Now she's on Tdm1, hoping to get rid of the three small mets that the surgeon has left. Is it possible that Tdm1 works better than Herceptin+Taxol+Perjeta combo? Is it possible to be on hormonal therapy and tdm1 at the same time? (Just wondering why the docs haven't given anything to mum for her hormons) Thank you all! (and sorry for my bad English)",

According to PET mum's situation is stable, nothing was signaled except the liver mets (SUV is a little bit high, since it's 5.7, but that's all). According to MRI liver mets are stable, but a couple of lymph in the sternum area are slightly inflammed. They are about 12mm-13mm. Bloodworks are ok (TMs not reliable). Mum's onc talked with another one from a different hospital and they agreed that, if the PET showed stable, mum had to go on with Kadcyla and had to keep the lymphs under control. Though today mum's onc wasn't there and she talked with another one, who said that it would have been better to change therapy and start chemo. I'm no doctor and I think that high SUV is not good, but, since there is nothing new and the mets are stable why start chemo? Prayers to you all",

She had nausea and yesterday night she vomited 3 times... now she has fever (about 100) and flu like symptoms. Her blood tests on Friday were fine (platelets, white and red) and previous week too (complete blood tests). She never had anything like that after treatment, just some slight constipation, slight nausea and (sometimes) low platelets... Is it possible that it's Kadcyla side effect after 8 days? Anyone experienced something similar? Prayers to you all",

Mum is feeling way better: no more fever, nor vomit and she's not feeling nauseated. I'm sorry if I got really worried just about a flu, but I never saw her feeling bad like the other night, not even when she had chemo. Thank you again. Prayers for you all and your families.",
