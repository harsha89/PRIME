Alot is good on this web site but until you have solid facts I may back off the internet for a bit (I just scared myself) I wish you well and I am sorry your dealing with this , if you have any questions feel free to write me, I work in health care as well....take care and you WILL get through this!!!! YOUR NOT GOING TO DIE! Just a curve in your life plan :) Rhonda",
