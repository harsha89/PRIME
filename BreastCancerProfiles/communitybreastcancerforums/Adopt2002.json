    "Content": "Adopt2002 wrote: Hi Everyone, after finding a hard lump under my left nipple, I had a core needle biopsy done last week. Yesterday I found out that I have no cancer, but an intraductal papilloma and my doctor wants to remove it. The surgery is scheduled for next Friday. I'm almost 48 and always been very healthy. I've never had any surgery, or been in a hospital. I've never been under general anesthesia before. Does it feel like I'm fainting when they put me under? This is totally new to me. I'm a bit scared about the procedure. Can anyone guide me and tell me what to expect? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
