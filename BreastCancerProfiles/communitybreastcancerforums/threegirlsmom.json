(at least on my head, no leg hair would make me happy til the end of time!)  I am wondering how long it has taken for people to start getting hair.  I have a fine covering right now, about half inch long and evenly spaced all over my head.  Kinda look like an ostrich....I don't think this look will be very attractive on the beach, tho...lol!
