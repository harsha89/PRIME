I found this website and message board very helpful when I was diagnosed in August and trying to make decisions about surgery etc. Though I referenced this board regularly, this is my first time posting. A little background, I was diagnosed with IDC on the right side in August. Genetic tests all came back negative. I was hormone positive and HER-. I was a 34 DD (maybe a little larger, but that was the bra size I was wearing) on a fairly petite frame. With very dense breast tissue, my breasts were very heavy and sagging. My right side was probably a cup size smaller than the left side (though I didn't really notice it until my diagnosis when I was paying more attention in the mirror after biopsies etc.) After genetic tests came back negative, my Oncologist suggested a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy followed by radiation. Because the right side was already smaller and would be even more so after the lumpectomy, I started thinking about having the reduction and lift at the same time - I believe it is termed Oncoplasty by reduction method for symmetry. I too was trying to decide whether to do it at the same time or wait until after radiation to do it. I can only speak to my personal experience and my thought process.....somewhere I had read that sometimes after radiation treatment you have a more difficult time healing. I also read that sometimes radiation can shrink the breast size. I hate needles and IVs and the effects of anesthesia so I started thinking about doing the reduction and lift at the same time as the lumpectomy/sentinel node biopsy on both sides so that I would only have to go through one surgery and one recovery. My oncologist had a plastic surgeon that she works with that she referred my to for a consult. The plastic surgeon thought that doing it all at the same time was the way to go. She left my right side a tiny bit larger than my left side to account for any radiation shrinkage that I may have. I am extremely happy that I decided to do both sides at the same time prior to radiation. Initially, the incision from the sentinel node biopsy (which is closer to the arm pit) bothered me more than the other incisions. Because that area pulls when you raise your arms etc. I was just more aware of it. Also, I had numbness in my arm pit and some tingling and numbness in my upper arm because of the nerves affected from the SNB. Not a lot of pain, just weird numbness and tingling mostly. I think personally, I would have been more uncomfortable if I had left the left side alone and only done the lumpectomy etc. on the right side. The heaviness of my breasts and the size difference I feel would have made my recovery more difficult. Of course, that is just my personal experience. Also, I am all about checking things off of my list and just moving through the process. I kept telling my friends and family that this was just a little bump in the road and I would be through it soon! If you decide to go this route, and you also need radiation, know that you may have to spend a couple of extra weeks healing from the oncoplasty before you can start radiation. My oncologist and plastic surgeon said that typically after lumpectomy, radiation starts 4 weeks later. Because of the oncoplasty, I had to wait 6 weeks post surgery to start radiation. My cancer was small and not aggressive and was not in the lymph nodes so my team of doctors all felt fine with waiting a couple of extra weeks to start radiation. Fortunately I did not need chemotherapy. I finished radiation the end of December and now have to take Tamoxifen for 5 years and hopefully all is good. Please feel free to message me if you have any additional questions. I will be happy to share my list of which items I found very helpful after surgery etc. I did a lot of research on post op bras etc. Sometimes it is hard to find comfortable ones. Best of luck to you both as you navigate your process!     ",

All of your points are very good! I too feel that my reduction helped my radiation treatment be more comfortable. I was able to do the 4 week course of radiation rather than the 6 weeks. That means you get the same dosage of radiation but in a shorter time period. That also means that, as my radiation oncologist had explained to me, most of the skin symptoms appear at the end of the treatment or shortly after treatments are finished. When I finished my radiation, I was instructed to not wear a bra if possible for a couple of weeks....instead I just wore a camisole or cotton tank top and dressed in layers. Since it was December/January I was wearing heavier clothes anyway. I was perfectly comfortable without a bra since I didn't have to deal with the heaviness and droopiness of my pre-surgery breasts. I am happy to share my experience if anyone else has questions related to radiation therapy as well. ",

My surgery was a little over 4 months ago.....I was told not to wear underwire for 6 months. I was also told not to go shopping for a fitted bra (band size and cup size) for 6 months. I have just been buying soft bras that come in small, medium, large sizes so far. Someone asked about extra gauze....when my plastic surgeon took me out of the post op bra she actually put narrow maxi pads in the crease under my breasts inside of my bra. Worked great to keep the bra from rubbing on the crease incisions and to soak up any oozing. I also used nursing pads over my nipples for a short period of time when the stitches were sticking to my bra a little bit. This helped me but I didn't need them for long. A surprise benefit from my radiation....my scars on the side treated with radiation are much thinner and softer than the non radiated side.  ",
