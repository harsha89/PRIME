I think the discussion came up because so many of us don't fit the timeline of this thread. So Z thought about a new thread that would be all inclusive. In my opinion the new thread lets everyone step forward. There are posts on the new thread from people that have been stage 4 for a good while but have been lurking for some reason and that is their first post. It allows them to say here I am without having to get personal at this point. I have always tended to be like that myself. Much more comfortable helping by sending out messages asking people to reply to thread than to post about my cancer. Everyone is so different. Anyway, in my opinion at some point we might want to consider removing this thread to avoid confusion and keep just the 2016 thread. Something to think about Maryanne ",

I was than switched to aromasin. Lasted 8 weeks and the same thing happened. I needed assistance just getting out of bed. Aromasin stopped and switched to falsodex. Started that mid January. Stopped aromasin end of December. It took about 4 to 5 months to get the ai out of my system. I feel no side effects from the falsodex. Falsodex is not typically a first line treatment so my oncologist had to get it approved. I am doing very well on it. I am overweight so I don't know if that was a factor with both previous ai treatments. I would ask the oncologist about falsodex. Mary anne",
