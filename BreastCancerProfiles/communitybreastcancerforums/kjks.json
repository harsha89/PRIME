I went back on Monday 20th march for my results the consultant said your biopsy is normal ( whew I was able to breath again) but then she said the radiologist felt the U/S was imcompatible with the biopsy findings and they could not say anymore. the multi disciplinary team are meeting on Friday 24th march to discuss all their problem cases including mine. They may ask for another core biopsy or an MRI. I suffer from fibromyalgia too and needless to say the last few weeks have sent this into overdrive I have opain all down my right side and I am thinking the worst case scenario. I haven't slept in a week despite my doctor giving me Xanex and sleeping tablets to tide me over until I get some diagnosis. My poor husband is exhausted I am up all night and crying at the drop of a hat all the time trying to act normal in front of my kids family and friends. Has anyone else ever had an outcome like this. Should I be a bit more positive that the biopsy is normal.Is it more telling than the ultrasound? I would appreciate any advice at all . I cannot believe how stressful this is .Im so terrified I feel like a may have a coronary before I get a final result Log in to post a reply",
