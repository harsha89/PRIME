    "Content": "Feb 24, 2015 11:00AM - edited Feb 24, 2015 11:02AM by snowy I am 43 and was diagnosed with atypical lobular hyperplasia in 2012 they want me on tomoxifen but I can't bring myself to take it. I take all the supplements as you and more like ip-6 gold,calcium d-glucarate etc. I have had thermography,mri and ultrasounds and thank God all clear so far. Do you take tomoxifen and are you still cancer free. Thank you for sharing.",
