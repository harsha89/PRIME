Blood work was run and my CEA and CA 29-29 came back elevated as well as my liver tests came back higher than usual. None of the numbers are extreme, just above the range (except for the CEA).

My CA 27-29 was 41 when I was diagnosed stage 2b with lymphatic invasion. It has always hovered between 31 and 35. Once it went to 39 when they changed labs. My CEA has never gone past 4. When I was in for my 6 mo appointment, I was asking him what early lung mets felt like. I have had a slight pain in my lungs and a funky cough, mostly at night. He didn't think it sounded like anything to worry about. Then two days later he calls which he has never done in all our years together, The CEA worries me more than the CA 27-29. ",

P.S.  It kills me that Amy didn't loose her hair.  I am 17 mos out from chemo and my hair still has not grown in to the point where I do not need a wig.",
