MakeLemonade - Did they tell you if we should expect the same after future infusions?  This kind of has me freaked out, although next time I'm going to take more time off and be extra careful.  We had visitors this weekend and some of them were sniffling due to allergies.  Not chancing it next time and will be telling them to turn around and go home. Cold - That is insanity!  Snow in May!  Here's to sunshine and budding flowers soon! Mommy Q - My expanders have been very painful since the infusion, especially in the rib area.  There has been a stabbing feeling especially when lying down.  I opted to skip out on this week's expansion to give myself a break.  I haven't had an ongoing low grade fever, only the high one from yesterday and today.  My onco nurse said not to worry unless it reaches 100.5 or higher and to hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.  I've also been achey, moves from shoulder/neck then legs.  Tylenol helps.  I think its normal and will pass within a week (hopefully).",

My biopsy at diagnosis came back with a grade 3 tumor.  After the mastectomy, the grading came back at 2.  When I looked at the 3 subsets for grading, my grade 2 was on the higher side (3+2+2) if that makes any sense.  My ki67 score was also high at 55% so I suspected I would need chemo all along.  My Oncotype ended up at 34 so was definitive for chemo.  My MO told me that even if it came back at the low end of intermediate (18-31) that she would have recommended chemo due to my age (38).  All this said, you are also lucky in that your tumor is less than 1 cm so may sway to no chemo. Fingers crossed your Oncotype comes back very low, but in case you need chemo, its very doable.  I am 1 week out from 2 of 4 treatments and have worked full time, taking off only 3 days, 2 of which were for infusion.  My first round was rough, but this time around everything has been manageable with OTC pain meds. ",

My bag included an IT cosmetics eyebrow pencil (my fav of the bag), Clarins sunscreen, 2 OPI nail polishes, an Estee Lauder foundation, EL lipstick, EL eyeliner, Elizabeth Arden powder, EA lipliner, facial lotion, makeup remover, and other stuff that I'm too lazy to dig out. Everyone had something different but every bag had mostly mid to high end makeup. Some bags had Kiehl products, Lancome, Chanel lip gloss, ..... Not too shabby, especially since its free!
