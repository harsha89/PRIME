I did talk to the doctor and she told me to wear my lymphedema sleeve. And take 4 ibuprofen every night. My question to any of you ladies is have you struggled with sleep since starting all this and what have you taken that works for you. I was kicking around taking Lexapro. I'm not a big fan of pills nor do I do a good job of taking them because I don't like to. But I'm getting frustrated with this lack of sleep at night and then trying to function during the day. I've always been that way but radiation seems to be making it way tougher. Any suggestions are welcomed.",

Yes he has been around after most of my treatments. He missed a couple of the AC treatments because he had to be out of town but for the most part yes he has been. I think he just feels that now that I'm done with chemo I should look at possibly doing some fun things for the summer. I can honestly look at him today and tell him I don't have any desire to be around all those people even if it is 4 weeks from now. I think that is where his frustration is kicking in. We looked at doing a vacation at the end of August which gives me a good 2 months after chemo. However my oncologist is not wanting me to wait 8 weeks out to start radiation. He told me I could wait 6 tops. We've been dealing with this since December and I think he's just ready to go have some fun. Me on the other hand I'm a hermit, dealing with depression, and have no desire to get out into public right now. I just want to get all this done and behind me before I get back out there. I don't know if that's the right attitude to have or not. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. I have said before and I will say it again. Your wife has been blessed by a wonderful man of god. :)",

It was pretty long answer anyways. Lol. So for the short version. Yes. Between neulesta and taxel I did experience bone and joint pain. I would end up taking hydrocodone as nothing else helped for the first 3 to 4 days. Also each treatment I had less an less energy. Glad to hear you going to ice. I dont think you will regret that decision. The nurses said they were impressed with the fact I could sit there will my feet in ice and hold my water bottles and sleep. Benadryl does that too me. Lol On the lighter said I experience no nausea and taste buds started coming back. 4 down 4 to go! Yea!!!",

How about you Maggie? Duffy great news about being portless! HikingLady How are you feeling? Been trying to stay up on protein for energy. I really notice the difference when I slack. DJT WOW! Your experience made me shudder as well. I have not had to experience anything like that. I remember they put a chip in my breast after they found the cancer but I don't remember any kind of wiring. What was Rads like. I started 9/4. (33 treatments). How is annastrozole treating you? Ingerp I'm hoping that you're feelings of down and out are starting to lift a little as you work through completing all your treatments. Engine Chillin time! Woo woo! Happy New Year to all our Jewish peeps out here! Many blessing to come your way this new year! I got back from my vacation from the Bighorn mountains on September 3rd. I was a little apprehensive about riding my 4-wheeler but i thought about DJT and her courage to ride her MC and I decided I was going for it. I had a blast out there! It was so nice to relax and just enjoy life. I took my thank you cards with me so that I could get them out while I was on vacation but I found myself not wanting to do them. I love being in the mountains! I've always thought when I look at a stream, mountain side, cloud formation, sunset or sunrise that God is an awesome artist! Started rads this past Tuesday. I have 6 more weeks of treatments to go. I was told by many people that I would feel tired. But holy molly I was so tired byThursday I actually took the day off Friday just so I could relax! I'm hoping that that was just because I had gone on vacation and came straight back into radiation and that I'm not going to be that exhausted every week. Still trying to work through the joint pain that the anastrozole is causing. I call it \"My Little Friend\" I've read on future boards where women have said to give it 3 to 6 months and that the side effects do start subsiding some. I will say my hot flashes are not as severe as they were when I first started taking it. Nor is my dizziness and nausia. I have chosen to take it right before I go to bed at night. I do have some sleeping issues but I find that the reason why I'm awake is because my hands or knees are hurting. I'm going to take turmeric when ever my doctor gets happy with my liver results. I go back in October to have that tested. Other than that I am just kind of hanging out trying to get back into work and cleaning house. Would much rather be out on the four wheeler! LOL On a sober note: I read a blog on another site out here regarding Rachel Bland. It talked about the words \"The Battle\" it brought me to tears and fears. Let me know if you all want me to share it out here. All forms of cancer suck!!! Have a wonderful weekend my friends!",

My dad always says live your life today and let tomorrow take care of itself. He just finished chemo a month ago for lung cancer. He feels the way you do about it as well. Short lived and he will move on. I had a non sleeping night last night with all that negative BS running through my head. Today I had a pep talk with myself and I also prayed for strength, courage and Peace. I just set up my console opt with the rad dr for next Tues. I will find out more then. Treatment plan from beginning was surgery, chemo, rads and hormone blocking pill for 10 years. I am 54 and have had a hysterectomy 12 years ago but kept my ovaries so not sure which pill yet. Thank you again for your encouraging words. I guess I was so frightened of the word chemo when I heard it that I created an emotional rollercoaster of problems for myself by over thinking the worst. You all are out here doing it too and are making me realize slowly but surely that it is doable, and then ya move on. :)",

Didn't really eat all that healthy this weekend. But she made the best chicken nachos and I wasn't about to turn them down. I'll get back to healthy again this week.

Kept them out odmf water as much as possible and took quick showers. They're growing back very strange so I'm cutting them super short still until they grow back right. As far as neuropathy I do remember getting numbness and sharp pains in my feet hands and calves as well as my thighs. My last chemo is June 28th and I still get sharp pains in my toes once in awhile and my fingers and definitely my thighs. Calfs seem to just Charlie Horse up a lot. I feel most of it in the hand I had the lymph nodes taken out-of and the knee that I had surgery on. I don't know if it attacks your weakest points or not.

Even though I'm doing radiation, unlike chemo, we got to go do some things like shopping and just running errands and she even went to my second job with me and helped me clean this weekend.

I came to the conclusion it's because it's summertime and that's when my BF and I go out and do most of our activities. I think I was handling my treatments better when it was still cold and rainy and nasty out. Now it's summer and I want to go play and I can't! The poor guy was loading up his four-wheelers the other day to go with his son and I started crying. You feel like you get so much taken away from you. We all we have to deal with our bodies changing and not feeling good and not being able to do what we would normally do. The only thing that I've kept consistent is work and that is so I won't lose my mind. I keep hearing about this New Normal?? I don't even know what to think about that! I don't know about everybody else but I just want to go back to me! So go ahead and let yourself get angry and pissed off and/or cry! I guarantee I don't think you're alone in this group. ;) As for your cough, I felt like I had a cold after every treatment. My nose would run and I would constantly be coughing and hacking. However each time I went in they gave me my treatment anyways. Said my numbers were fine. Also my knees would hurt. They still hurt. It's hard to sleep at night when you roll over and your knees touch each other and they hurt. I get that as well. What I did was start putting a pillow between my legs so that they would not touch each other and cause that pain. It seem to help a lot. My head starting sprouting during taxel. Feels like a prickly Cactus right now. Love laying on it. LOL. Armpits are definitely growing much faster and believe it or not so is down under. (TMI) However when those started growing again I ended up with ingrown hairs like you would never believe. I have heard that sometimes taxel takes it all away again. The joys of chemo. Right?! Hang in there! You can do this. You have all of us to vent to and reach out too! Before ya know it you can say adios chemo world I am out! Since I can't hug ya, reach out to the little ones for a big hug!",

I took the advice and when I went to see the radiation Dr she was very impressed with the fact I had hardly any scare tissue. She told me that was good because radiation would make scare tissue hard and lumpy. Just thought I would share that forward. Heading to MO tomorrow to learn more about want is in store. I have my pad full of questions for him. Today was my first time in 16 weeks that I did not have to go to chemo world. It was a good feeling and I did the no chemo dance!

I don't know if it has anything to do with you going topless as I have been going topless for quite a while now. At first I thought everyone was looking me as well. You know, I think I was just imagining that. Most people are to wrapped up in their own lives to even notice. Lol. My radiation doctor said to me that some people do develop this anxiety as their treatment comes to an end. There sub conscious mind starts reflecting what they've been through. The radiation tech started playing music for me to take my mind in a different direction. I remind myself about all the different people that I know on this board and in person that have been through radiation and if they can do it so can. I also pray for strength and courage and the spirit of peace. I have four more to go. You can do it Frog!! Congrades on getting the drains out Undrago. Also good to hear your headed to therapy for your arm. I haven't heard about the medication that you are going to be taking. I have heard of the tests that you are are talking about if it is immunity therapy? If so my SO's mom is doing that. She goes for an infusion every 3 weeks, she said there's not much side effects at all to it. She's just started developing mouth sores so she has to watch what she eats. She has to do it for a whole year and she has 2 more months to go. She's doing it for lung cancer, a tumor that is inoperable but shrunk from chemo and now they're building her immune system to fight it off if it starts to grow back. Is that the type of test your thinking about getting involved in? As far as camping, yep that is my get away for sure! You can really get in touch when you get away from it all! GaWarrier Thank you for your incouraging words. Just think surgery is one more step closer of being done!! As far as your back, my back was hurting a lot. I started doing certain stretches and it seems to be lifting off the pain. It took a while while, specially if it's your lower back. If it just now starting to hurt maybe you are holding all your stress in your back? I tend to hold mine in my shoulders as neck. My mom and dad started listening to sound escape's on TV. We all have Spectrum Cable. It plays very zen like music to relax with. I gave it a shot last night and you know it was pretty relaxing. Good to hear that your fingers and feet are feeling better. I still am struggling with feeling like I'm walking around on rocks and sand in my shoes. However I have noticed it's only with tighter shoes. I went out and bought myself as pair of dansko shoes. We're pretty pricey but my feet do feel better. Engine I cannot even believe the Janice is still dealing with drainage from her incision! How long has it been now? From the sounds of it her job is pretty stressful! I work with the public both in person and on the phone. It cracks me up when they want to walk through an application line by line including their name and address. Lol Interg how have you been feeling? Have you started the estrogen-blocking pill yet? You are also going to do anastrozole, right? I believe DJT is taking that same pill as well. DJT haven't heard much from you since you showed us the top of your cute head! :-) InnaB how is rads for you? How many are you doing? I am so glad that the weather has gotten warmer. GAwarrier, Yes, it was 65 degrees on Saturday and by 8 that night had dropped down to 19 degrees with a snowstorm. It's just now starting to get a little warmer again. This weekend is suppose to get back up into the 60's. Yay!! Don't have to do my cleaning job this weekend so I'm trying to get some stuff done around my house that I couldn't do this summer. I hope everyone is having a wonderful week. I will check back again to see how everyone's doing as the week goes on. Huggs!!",

      "Content": "Oct 26, 2018 03:45PM - edited Oct 26, 2018 03:48PM by LIFE1963 Frog I too am usually positive. I think it's just all this treatment crap. I know I'm supposed to be thankful that I was able to do chemo and radiation but to be quite honest with you I'm angry about it. I am worried about what the future holds and what has happened to my body since all of this treatment. I'm pissed that before all this started I would not even take anything for a headache. I tried to either stretch, drink some water or use something natural like a topic rub. All I kept hearing is that you're healthy and you'll do fine with chemo and all I kept repeating is yeah I'm healthy now but what about when it's all said and done? My SO keeps reminding me that I was told this early stage. Yep. I am quite the negative Nelly right now. I'm also very much aware that there are people on this board that are going through this more then once. I think I really need to get a grip and quit being such a Negative Nelly about it all. But alas it is a struggle, I'm finding myself not being close to people, you guys are the only ones I really talk to these days. I can't sleep at night and I'm totally exhausted during the day. I'm sure that's part of my disposition problem. I just finished radiation Monday so I am 4 days out. I do believe I'm more tired now than I've been. I've chosen during my staycation to clean out my closets and just get rid of a bunch of crap that I don't need. These past month since I have been home I have looked around my house and thought why would one person need all of this stuff. It's been really kind of nice clean it all out and get rid of it. Engine I think waiting is an excellent idea. Nobody wants to go through all that again. Especially If Dr. is telling you it will probably heal on it's own. Underago and Gawarrior how are you feeling since your surgeries? InnaB how many more rad treatments to go? How is that going? DebA have you gone to see the medical specialist. Cant remeber what type it was. Sorry. Maggie I have been meaning to ask if you are you taking any hormone inhibitors? I am taking anastrozole. Some nights I have to ask myself how am I going to go through this for the next 10 years. Sometimes my hands and joints hurt so bad. But then the next morning I get up and it's fine. Seems to hit more at night, don't know if it's the way I'm sleeping or if my arm gets cold or what. I'm going to wait until after I'm totally done with radiation and give it a couple more months to see if it goes away before I start complaining to the doc. DJT, Duffy, Notered. Hickinglady, how are you all doing? I hope well! Ingerp Enjoy you vacation! Signing off for now. Have a nice weekend if we don't chat before then. Sorry if I misspelled anyone's names I'm doing this by memory and we all know how well our memory is right now. LOL",

Glad to hear you don't. They can get tuff. My radiation doctor also told me that my emotions would probably get to me after everything is over. I have decided to start seeing a therapist to work through this emotional roller coaster I am on. Undrago thank you for the receipe. Cant wait to try it out! I went to the farmers market a couple weeks ago and got some roasted peppers. Maybe I'll use some of those. Also, I had a couple of stitches as well. I also had one were my port was taken out. Whatever you do don't pull on them. A gal thought she could get my Stitch out where my port was and kept pulling and pulling in it kept getting longer and longer so I made her stop. Went to the doctor and the doctor said it's a good thing you didn't keep pulling because she could have caused me problems. They could have been pulled apart and they're meant to dissolve. She cut the tip-off and I never had problems again. Huggs everyone!",

Go back in 30 days for another test to see if it is getting better. Heading to dentist tomorrow to have my teeth check to make sure everything is ok.

I was shocked to see how much food I pulled out of my cupboard and put in a box to give away that had soy in it. I will have to admit I have kept some of the things because I don't eat them everyday and I figured it won't hurt me once in awhile. Then I went shopping to try and refill my cupboards with anti soy food. Wow that was a project and a half! Is anyone else out there going to purge their cupboards of soy? Have you been told not to eat it?",

The longer I took the pill the more my body became used to it and things started settling down. The only thing that wasn't lifting up was the pain at night when I was trying to sleep. I've since changed taking the pill at night to taking it at 9:30 in the morning. It seems to have done the trick. I no longer wake up in pain and I can go right back to sleep. Engine it sounds like Janice does have a very stressful job! I do agree I really think your such a wonderful husband to worry about her and support her the way you do. Undrago a little over 1/2 to go! What a lucky chick getting to take use or lose and relax! Gawarrier thank you for filling me in about your surgery I don't know where I miss that at. Wishing you the best on Friday! Good news for me my liver enzymes are finally back to where they belong! At my Christmas party this weekend I intend to have a big glass of wine or a red beer. (Both sound so good!) I know I know we need to watch our alcohol intake but I could really use a drink. LOL Also My OC told me that he will be doing blood marker test every 3 months for the next 3 years. If the protein levels register high then he'll do a scan to see what's going on. I got my first marker done and he said it came out clean. Are any of you out there having your markers checked? I also asked him how he was going to know if the anastrozole is its job? He told me because I was post menopausal there was no test out there to make that determination because my estradiol levels are already low. I'm going in for my breast mamo for my other breast that was not affected by cancer tomorrow as well as my first bone scan so that he has a baseline to compare in 2 years. All in all he said I'm doing pretty good and as time goes on I should start feeling better. Eyebrows are still hanging out, hair is thick and curly and my eyelashes are starting to fall out. Not quite ready to cut my hair into a style yet. Still just getting used to having curly hair. Definitely show your pictures when you go get your new Styles ladies! I'm going to have to say I admire you ladies for taking on this new way of eating. I can honestly tell you that I am struggling with changing my way of eating. I don't feel that I have a bad way of eating but I definitely don't eat all those fruits and vegetables that were mentioned. And I have every intentions on diving into a huge steak now that I've been approved to eat red meat again!! I also find myself dabbling into the chocolate at work where it is on everyone's desk. I've come to the conclusion that I'm not going to fight this right now because with all the Christmas candy and cookies and everything else it's surfacing around me I'm going to just enjoy it and then I'll look at changing things come January. I know you ladies and gent will be out there to cheer me on come January and give me all sorts of great advice! Oh and definitely glad to hear that I'm not the only one walking around with a foggy mind! ;) Thinking of you all even if I didn't mention your names I haven't forgotten you. Have a wonderful remainder of the week! ",

Deb maybe I should have that conversation with my significant other as we ended up in a huge fight the other day on the way home from my doctor's appointment because he asked me a question and I felt I answered it. Then he asked me for morr questions which I thought were pretty much the same question. Then he went off on me and started yelling that he didn't feel he should have to ask me six questions to get an answer. Well I pretty much quit talking to him after that and we really haven't spoken since and that was 3 days ago. If It's one thing I don't need is somebody yelling at me because I don't give them the answer they want.

My liver enzymes are starting to go down but they are not where he wants them to be. He has not told me what his plan of action is if they are not where he wants them to be come October. However I am only 61/2 weeks out from DD taxol so I think he just feels my body needs more time to heal. I do take Ibuprofen when the joints in my fingers and hands get to hurting too bad. I've also been just using topical creams. I am not a huge pill person so it has been a struggle for me to even admit that I need something for the pain or stiffness. I just asked on the board Doing well with Anastrozole\" The question to anyone else out there on what they were doing for there joint pain in their hands and wrists. Hopefully someone's has better ideas that are working for them. Getting ready to go on vacation for a camping trip for a solid week we decided to wait until Sunday to go though. We were trying to get everything done Plus work my daytime job and my night time job and I was becoming exhausted.

Deb your hair is taking off like a weed! Looks very soft. Very beautiful. GaWarrier is that your natural color? InnaB I really hope that your insurance approves the machine that I use. It does seem to help. I have started doing weight training again to see if I can get some strength back in my arms so I can start bowling again. I have been using my machine everyday. Duffy thank you for sharing your story. You are a very strong woman indeed. I set myself up a personal goal. I've decided that I want to be able to bowl in the women's state tournament on March 3rd. Before I go on I just want you all to know I am not a professional bowler by any means . I'm lucky if I break a 110 when I do bowl. Lol. But I was quite bummed when I had to drop out of the league I was playing in on Friday nights last year. I got pretty excited when I got a text message asking if I wanted to play in the tournament. So I'm going for it! Well I have got a lot to do around this house. I'm still trying to clean out closets and drawers and stuff and getting rid of crap that I don't need. Today I'm tackling my little office with all those papers. Ugg! Have a wonderful blessed day!",

Windy! Windy! Mock 60 MPH gust. Actually caused my alarm on my back door to go off the other day. This time of year I have a very close relationship with my electric blanket. 😍 I am going to try my hand on making green chili this weekend. Never made my own green chile before. I bought a bunch of green roasted chiles at the flea market last summer. The only thing is with my little chemo foggy brain going on I forgot to peel them. 🙄 I'm going to defrost them and hopefully peel them now. LOL Deb I tried the hidding an egg in my hair the other day. Nope! 😆 Super busy at work with both jobs. Just when things started getting back to \"normal\" one of my peeps that cleans for me was diagnosed with throat cancer. After listening to all the things that he has to go through. I don't think I could do that radiation part. He had to be fitted for a face mask! I was having anxiety just laying there. They would definitely have to drug me up on a daily basis to get through that. They are putting in a feeding tube just to be on the safe side. He is a very thin small guy to begin with. He and his wife both clean for me so I will be taking on some extra nights. Its time to pay forward. Speaking of pay it forward. Have you guys ever heard of when you are in the line at a fast food and you go to pay your bill and somebody in front of you already paid it? It happens occasionally around here. After I experienced it for my first time I now like to do it every once in awhile to surprise the person behind me. Now, no judgment here. LOL. I was at McDonald's yesterday and I decided to pay for the person that was behind me. It ended up being a Happy Meal! A whopping $4. I'm sure that guy was like umm okay. Thanks. 🤣🤣 Hope you all have a wonderful weekend!",

Hope everything is minimal side-effects for you and you finally get to be out of chemo world!! Undrago surgery does cause anxiety for sures. All of this stuff does! So it's I am reading your last post correctly after your chemo your tumor did not shrink any? So now you're getting a lumpectomy and having your lymph nodes taken out? Sorry if I'm misunderstanding that. If you were standing in front of me right now I would give you a ginormous hug. Hoping that you get some kind of Peace of Mind and your anxiety starts to drop down a little very soon. Also I have picked up a magnesium called CALM. Some people say that it even helps with your sleep because you relax so much. I have not experienced that. I am so high-strung most the time that it takes a lot for me to get a good night sleep.  ",

Really hoping I don't cough during radiation when they start it back up on Monday as I think they probably will. SO's family was in town for the last 2 weeks. I got to see them a couple of times until I got sick and then decided to stay away so that his mom doesn't get sick as she is going through her own lung cancer treatment. She is doing what they call immunity infusions. Apparently it is a drug that they use to cure bladder cancer and they have discovered that it also helps with certain lung cancers so that it strengthens your immune system to to fight back if the cancer tries to grow. Totally and experimental deal but she is willing to try. We all got together last night had dinner and played board games. They leave today. DebAl I too have been stressing about reoccurrence lately. I find myself reading it on the internet story after story. I hear it in my personal life around neighbors, friend ect good and bad. When I was going through treatment I didn't think about it much I guess I was just focused on all the side effects I was dealing with and the roller coaster of emotions on top of it. Now I do think about it and it freaks me out!!! How is the intagrative medicine services? Do you have tips or advice to share yet? Engine my father has told me this is short lived so live for today and let tomorrow take care of itself. He too went through lung cancer treatment and he dealt with it a lot better than I have because of his theory tomorrow will take care of itself. So is my SO's mother. Now me on the other hand I'm one of those people that are thinking okay I got thru today but what about 9 months from now! I really truly do need to learn to get into that calm mode of let tomorrow take care of itself. InnaB thank you the update on the acupuncture. Going through chemo I was getting a massage every two weeks and I think that was helping me out a lot. However the last two taxols my skin hurts so bad and it was so dry that I said no way is anyone touching my body. Now I feel like I just need to get through radiation before I go back into massage. Undrago I was told to get some Ultra Repair Cream for my dried up skin. That stuff is awsome! I also bought a lotion wand at Bed Bath and Beyond to put it on my back. The direction say to put lotion in the wand but I just rub it on the wand its self and apply that way. Works great! I've been thinking about the ladies out here that have gone through this more than once. I think about some of you fighting off more then just breast cancer past or present. I admire your strength and courage through it all. I also deeply appreciate that you are on this board caring and sharing your past and present experiences. DJT, Frog, Interg, Warrier, Duffy Hikinglady, Notered and Maggie hope you all are doing better with SE, Surgies, rads. Sorry if I missed anyone! Hugs to all my wonderful, strong beautiful ladies out there and of course the devoted, handsome gent!",

DebAl that is pretty amazing that your friend could go all those years and just live her life. My mom keeps telling me that. She is eight years out. Her's never hit her lymphnoids. She's pretty good at it as well. Me, I am the girl that's going to think, what's going to happen in 5 years?! I really need to just chill. Kudos to you runners out there! I never really could get into that sport. My go-to was volleyball. Played for 20+ years. I finally gave up the sport when the doctor told me on my last knee surgery, back when I was 45, that the next one would be a replacement. My thoughts were, I'm not a professional and I'm not making money at this so I'm out. I probably feel the achiness and pain more in my hands, knees and right shoulder since taking anastrozole. However it could just be the fact that I'm 56 and my body is paying me back for all those years of playing. So we are having the most bizarre weather right now. We were supposed to get a big winter blizzard. It didn't really snow that long or that hard. But then the last five days it just keeps snowing, however not leaving anything on the ground. It's so bizarre! You look outside and the sun is shining and you think yeah it has stop snowing! Less than a half hour to an hour later you look outside and it's snowing! I wish mother nature would make up her mind whether she's ready for spring or not. LOL Well I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead!",

Now you're going to think this is pretty Kookie but how I got through this date is I changed up some events so that it didn't seem like everything was falling back into place. It seemed to help me a lot to get through that date. Good to hear that you got to travel even though you're doing treatment. That dry skin is pretty miserable I only experienced at sensation on my back now. My OC told me to eat more foods with fat like avocados and stuff like that. As well as lotion up every day with a good moisturizer. I too am not sleeping well at night. I need to start taking stuff to get better night sleep as well. I don't know if it's anxiety but I'm waking up with my ankles crossed really tight, or my hands are aching and feeling like they're falling asleep or I'm fighting my pillow all night. I just know that I am not sleeping. Duffy thank you for sharing once again your experiences during your first and second bout of cancer. I think it's so sweet that your husband was concerned. I'm glad you shared your anxiety and experiences so that I would understand and know that this is a normal thing that I just need to process through. Your hair is looking very nice. Also since I'm not a fan of either one of the college teams that you girls are so you will not hear any Guff from me. LOL Deb that is great news that you got to get a new job! It sounds like you really enjoy it as well. It is tough sitting at a desk and walking across the room. Those first initial steps are slow and stiff. However my second job I'm moving and grooving so I don't feel that stiffness once I get going. The radiation doctor nurse told me that weight gain is expected on Anastrozole because of the fact that we have no estrogen on our body and that will slow down our metabolism. Have you heard anything like that? Engine that is great news about Janice starting to feel better and turning the corner. Glad to hear you got to spend time with your family for the holidays too. I had a powwow with the significant other this morning regarding how things have been going between us. It was pretty hard to admit to him that I felt like he had been pretty hard on me this past year. I felt I needed to get it out in the open though because I can feel some resentment inside of me building. I don't know if I was just overly sensitive this year or if this is how he handles stressful events. We talk things out and hopefully we're getting back on the right track. I guess time will tell. What's everybody's plans for New Year's? Believe it or not I have no desire to go out and party I just want to stay home, chillax and watch a good comedy. Well my laundry is not going to get done with me sitting in my recliner watching TV and talking to everybody out here. LOL I will check in again before the new year. ",

You go GaWarrier! You celebrity you!! Engine how exciting! That will be a great time. Batata That is great news! Cording is very painful and takes awhile to get rid of. Yes I was talk to about allergies after chemo. My OC said I could either develop allergies that I never had before or if I have allergies they could go away. Something about chemo changes up your system. Urdrago That really sucks that your having such a hard time with this trail med. Ugg. You are such a patient person. I would have done turned into a sailor chick over the whole thing. How frustrating!! Really hope they figure something out for you very soon. Well it looks like we're up for a blizzard. They are so convinced that this blizzard is going to hit that they have already closed the schools for tomorrow, some businesses are already closed, the city and county are closed. State is still open though. It's crazy cuz it was like 55 degrees here today. And now that I'm at my cleaning job it's only 45. It's beautiful out. But according to the weather we are to get hit with a major blizzard starting to tonight all the way through Thursday with high winds of 60 mile an hour gust and 28 inches of snow. I don't mind snow. I have a four-wheel drive I can blast through it with. However, I freaking hate shoveling! Especially in March because the snow is so heavy. Grrr Signing off for now! :)",

There's still some more out there that were missing. I'm sure eventually they'll surface as well. ;) Duffy your nails look so nice! Yeah. I keep cutting mine down when they get long because they split. I can't use the shellac polish though because it thins my nails out. Perhaps I should check out this bio gel. 🤔 Now as far as my hair is concerned, I have a cowlick in the back, actually two, so I tried to blow dry it out with a brush and curl it today. I feel I should share with you that I used to have long thick hair. So the only curling iron I have is for long thick hair. You should have seen me in the bathroom trying to curl my short hair with this ginormous long thick curling iron. Can we say afro city! I am talking big and frizzie! Lol Keep smiling my dear friends! Your all very beautiful women. Huggs to you all! Ola Engine! Good to hear from you! Glad Janice is feeling better as well. Check in later!",

I love the idea of cutting a little bit of my hair out and putting it in a bowl to see what color it will change. I too am leery of doing any kind of coloring for fear I'll end up bright orange or super burgundy red. LOL Undrago I love your attitude! Hope your business trip was good. I always like going on trips but I love coming back home. Your nails are really cool. Looking forward to seeing pictures of your nail art as well. How fun to have a nail party! I just had my first pedicure and manicure done yesterday since chemo. The gal was carrying on about how my toenails were so out of control. LOL. I told her I've been trying to cut them myself but the last time I did I cut them super short so I decide to let them grow out as long as possible and then come and see her. It felt so good! I never used to get pedicures because I have toes that curl under, I think they're called hammer toes. I figured what's the point, until a girlfriend talked me into it one time. Now I thoroughly enjoy them. Thanks for the advice on how to use a curling iron I went and bought a small one for the occasion. Interg Yes! I do believe your hair is growing out straight! I bet you're so happy that you no longer have to deal with curly. I'm getting used to it. I post it on Facebook asking my peeps what they thought about me growing it out or cutting it into a cute short style. Most peeps said continue to let it grow the curls look cute. They want to see what it's going to look like when it's long and curly. I think, the longer it gets the more it's going to start dropping down and not look as curly. We shall see. My hair doesn't grow as fast as it used to. Usually it would have taken me a half a year to grow my hair down past my shoulders. I'm actually getting used to having short hair and enjoying the easiness of it. Not having to wear a ponytail or pulled up all the time. Yes. I take my Anastrozole everyday. I have maybe forgotten it twice since last July and totally freaked out when I did. My OC said just take it when you remember it but make sure I take it everyday. Yep. Looking at those numbers that you just posted, I will be taking it every day for the next 10 years of my life. MAY IS ALMOST HERE!! 😁 Krissy37 I just thought I would let you know that when I did my first Zomata infusion I was miserable as well. My OC started adding fluid to my infusion so I get a bag of fluid with my zometa and I feel totally fine. I don't know if your doctor would be willing to try that for you. Also they slowed my drip down. Yeah it takes about 45 minutes to an hour to get it now but so worth not feeling like crap the next couple of days. Frog How are you doing? If you're almost done post it out there so we can all cheer for you!! Deb I'm going to have to say you completely Rock the Olivia Newton-John look! And when I see your arms I think to myself ,man I want those arms! I keep popping into the gym and doing my circuit training. I am really struggling with eating right. I just want to eat what I want to eat. YA know. I think it's because I was so strict on my diet during chemo and radiation with just chicken fresh fruit vegetables. Now I'm all about Chinese food, steak and Mexican food! I guess that's why I go to the gym. Right? LOL. Friday night was our last night for bowling and I actually drank quite a bit. I'm telling you I haven't drank like that for a while so those four beers had me going Lalalala. Lol Batata Ya kinda of freked me out when you made that statement about your tumor marker. I go in for my digital mammogram in 3 weeks. I did a health fair blood screen last week and everything looked good. Except for my thyroid. My thyroids been wackadoodled ever since chemo. They're trying to decide if they're going to change my medication or just let it go and see if it works its way out. Sounds like you're having a blast with your hair. I am such a chicken. I don't even know what to do with my hair. Lol. Hope you're doing well and that all your scans come back negative, negative and negative!! 😊 Duffy That sounds like such a fun trip to celebrate! As far as my eyelashes, they will go through spurts as well. They'll start growing and then all the sudden they'll start falling out. I don't know about anybody else but when I go to itch my eyes, I'm like! Oh my gosh am I going to rub all my eyelashes off. My eyebrows seem to be doing fine. They're not as thick and bushy as they used to be but I actually prefer that. I don't have to pluck them as often anymore. LOL Speaking of lashes, they look great! Also. I would have never guessed that you were drawing your eyebrows on. InnaB. That totally sucks! I mean 19 years and all of a sudden it's. See Ya! I'm hoping they give you some kind of benefit for working all those years before letting you go. Like extra bonus or something. Wow! Now after carrying on about all that. There is not a doubt in my mind with your talent and experience you will rock another job in no time! Well I think it's time to go to the eye doctor. I was just telling my girlfriend that I can barely see anything in my glasses these days. I don't know if my prescription is doing its job anymore after chemo. My doctor did tell me to try and wait as long as I can before going back to the eye doctor. My last chemo was June 28th. I feel I've waited long enough. Are you other ladies out there struggling with your eyesight since chemo? I also I'm still struggling with a little bit of neuropathy in my feet and my hands keep falling asleep. It's kind of becoming a norm for me. I've noticed also that my socks are sucking into my feet and my ankles during the day. I have never had that problem. Anybody else out there dealing with that? I'm hoping as time goes on that goes away. I's super uncomfortable sometimes. God continues to bring people in my life to remind me there is always someone out there going through more than I could imagine. It seems to happen every time I start getting that whoa is me feeling. Straightens me right out! Well my neighbor just mowed there long. So guess what that means to me since our lawns are connected? Boo Hiss! I did not want to mow my lawn today! LOL. We are supposed to get another heavy snow storm come through,but after the last one I'm not convinced it's going to happen. However I have not put my snow shovel in the shed yet. LOL Hugs to everybody! Sorry if I missed anyone. Best of luck to everyone who is getting any kind of scans or testing done.",

So after reading all your replies of your fears and anxieties you all are going think I am nuts when I share mine but here is goes. I too fear reaccurrance. Every new feeling I feel in my body I think oh no! Did I make the right decision going with a lumpectomy? I think if I am ever faced with all this again down the road how in the h*ll am I going to do it?! Will all this treatment leave permanent problems that is going to change my life? Will I get to do what I love again or is that gone forever because my body can't hang? Will taking a hormone blocking pill for the next 10 years of my life completely zap my sex drive to where I can never be close to my BF in that area again? I know that a 2B stage is early detection and my ON says my curable is a high yet still all this goes through my head. I also know deep inside this could be a lot worse and I really just need to suck it up. These thoughts can drive a person crazy and they bring me to tears. InnaB thank you for encouraging me to share my thoughts and fears. Hopefully it was not to much of a overload for everyone. I know everyone is struggling and fighting their own personal battles with all this as well. I have said it before and I will say it again. I am sooo glad I found all of you. You all in each of your own way encourage me, comfort me, and sometimes crack me up! Here is hoping anyone going through treatment this week have a weekend of null to none side effects. For those waiting on test results may you have a peaceful weekend. Have a wonderful weekend Everyone!",

I am going to make an opt with dentist to have him check out my teeth since chemo treatments. I had an opt right before, teeth cleaning. Said everything looked good. I am scheduled to do infusions every 3 months for 3 years. I am scheduled to take as Anastrozole for 10 years. Told me it can cause joint pain. Said excirsise and eating heathly will help with that. I beginning to now understand this \"new normal\" life style that we have to take on. As far as my teeth. I have a couple of false teeth from s car accident years ago that chemo has caused to start my gum to recede from one of th he false teeth. Wish I could have gotten to the dentist before my first treatment today. I dont have an opt till 3 weeks from now. Grrr. For the most part though I usually do get good reviews with my teeth.",

I even laid in bed this morning contemplating not going to work because I felt like I look like such a freak. However I sucked it up and went to work and got over it. Well maybe not over it, but accepting it more. That's awesome news to hear about your hair! Engine that is wonderful news about Janice! I'm glad that they are paying attention and deciding to cut down the treatment so she doesn't have any more problems. That's a good doctor that pays attention. You know I was thinking the other day. I love reading your posts, receiving your support and supporting you when I can. I think about you during the day and sometimes share your stories with my SO and coworkers. I have learned so much from each of you. Not just about chemo or treatments or side effects but about life as well. Each of us have our own separate roads as chemo ends. Some of us will be going to radiation others will be going through surgery. I was just wondering if we would all stay on the same board and continue to communicate through these Journeys or go our separate ways on to other boards? I understand what has brought us together and pray that as our treatments end we can all move forward with our lives and never have to endure this again. I want you all to know that you have become a very important part of my life. I would not have made it through this without you. Although this may be pre mature I also want to tell you that I will never forget you and your kindness during one of these hardest times of my life. It's to bad we all live so far apart. Getting together and meeting in person would be so cool! Julia (Julz)",

I started to get little whiskers the second week of taxol. My eyelashes and eyebrows fell out after taxol was over. I think it was 4 weeks. However my hair is now little fuzzies all over my head. Looks like it's going to come in salt and pepper color. My eyelashes are slowly but surely coming back and so are my eyebrows. My oncologist said if I wanted to I could use litish on my eye lashes if they don't come back in but I'm going to give it a little more time. Struggling with really super dry skin all over my body. One of the gals on another board told me about first aid ultra repair cream. Works like a charm! Also using relpens to help with dryness as well. Trying to get my house cleanned this weekend as it has been a very long time since I had the energy to do that . During A/C I could do chemo nesting cleaning but during taxol forget it! INNAB I am 5 weeks away from chemo and energy is coming back. When I was on taxol I thought I would never find my energy level again. There is hope! Everyone have a wonderful less or no SE weekend!",

I can't imagine the emotions that are going through you all trying to get through something that close to the heart and then cancer diagnose and chemo as well. Then of course taxel/steroids are not helping with you coping through all of this either I am sure. My heart is going out to you all right now. I recall experiencing some minor itching throughout my body off and on while on taxol. I remember laying in bed having an itch there and itch here. Nothing consistent except for my hands and feet they would itch like crazy! I know after taxol because my skin was so dry every time it got sweaty or hot my back would itch like crazy too. Yeah red meat definitely did not taste good. I did force myself to eat it a couple of times because I too was feeling weak. I lived on chicken, drank a ton of water, ate nuts and I would do slow walks just to keep my energy going as much as I could. I found that if I kept up on the protein my energy would not drop as bad. I also found that every once in a while a banana or Gatorade would help me better as well. So glad to hear that you got some hydrocodone. I would tell my oncologist that after I'm done with all this cancer treatment I will be checking myself into a drug rehab center. He would give me the funniest look. Lol 2 down 2 to go!! You can do this!!",

You know I think she's right because once I took my chemo scarf off and started running around bald-headed my hair took off like a weed. My eyebrows as well. Now I will be honest with you all it was tough running around to grocery stores, work and the gym in my bald head. But I powered through my fears. Now I'm not even sure what I was scared of. There was no bad reactions. No one stared or gave me weird looks or even was rude or even anything. Some people would say they hope I'm feeling well but that was about it!

I too am going to take that into consideration and start doing as well cuz you're right it will keep me accountable when I look at it that at the end of the day and see how my joints are feeling and determine if I need to increase or decrease. Also my doctor has approved turmeric for joint inflammation and pain. However I'm not allowed to take it till after my liver enzymes are back to normal. He said I have to wait till October to get my next blood draw. So I can't really tell you if it works or not. LOL I feel most of my joint ache in the surgery arm with the 23 lymph nodes that were moved as well as my hand. My other hand aches but not near as bad. I have been doing physical therapy to strengthen my arms and they have Incorporated legs as well. Feels good to get movin again. Also does anyone know if it is ok to take ibuprofen every day for joint pain? I've been trying not to do that but some days my hands hurt so bad I have no choice.",

I had told my SO that I better get used to the fact that my hair is never going to be that long thick stuff again and ditched my cap and scarf before it started coming in good other than when I was out in the sun for a long period of time.

I had my ultrasound done Friday on my liver. Now we wait and see if it tells My OC what he's looking for or if I have to do the CT scan next. Yesterday I was out grocery shopping and ran into an old friend I hadn't seen in years. She said her husband head that I had breast cancer. Then she said the ultimate words that I so did not need to hear. She went on to tell me that she had a friend that had breast cancer went to the treatment did really good and then the breast cancer came back in her liver and colon. Thanks for sharing that tidbit of information. I just love when people share that bright colorful news with me. I know it's out there, i know if can happen and that it does exists. Seriously, I often have to ask myself what makes a person feel that that is the right thing to say? Am I just being overly sensitive? I have slumped into this lazy mode lately. Like I have no desire to do any kind of cardio at all other than when I clean the medical facility I cleaned. I wasn't really released by the radiation doctor to go to the gym and start doing weight training. As a matter of fact she told me just to give myself till the end of the year to heal before starting a regiment like that. I'm sure it has something to do with the 23 lymph nodes that were taken out. I just bought myself a pedometer on Amazon. Hopefully keeping track of my steps will get me moving again. It could be the cold snowy weather too though I've never been one that likes to work out when it's cold out. LOL I started drinking calm at night to help with the joint pain and muscle tension. I think it's actually working I only remember waking up 3 or 4 times last night and it wasn't because of pain. Perhaps I should try and drink this calm a little earlier in the evening so I'm not up all the time if you catch my drift. LOL Hope you all are doing well and having a great weekend. Those of you traveling for the holidays be safe. Huggs to you all.",

I'm just hoping that he really gets all this together and get to CT scan if necessary and all my other scans before the end of the year before my deductible starts all over again. Crap I'm still paying on this year's deductible! Ugg. Oh well I need to stop complaining because I do have insurance. Rant Over. You know I think I might try out yoga. I do mild stretching at home but I'm sure I would be fine to go and do the yoga class at the gym and walk the treadmill. It is a way to get back into the gym slowly but surely. Thanks! Happy Thanks Giving to you as well! ",

Helps a lot! They showed me stretches for my sciatic nerve to and that is helped tremendously as well. I do my stretches faithfully every day. I also have the Michelin Man suit if my arm gets too bad which I'm supposed to do every day but I'm hitting it every other day. Undrago You sound like things are running pretty smooth you for the RADS portion of the treatment. That's awesome! Gawarrier How are you feeling after surgery? Went to my company Christmas party last night and had a blast! Danced my socks off! Well I call it dancing anyways) hee hee. Anyways I only had one drink because it really didn't taste all that great to me. LOL. However! Boy did I pork out on the desserts. They were delicious! Duffy I don't know if I'm just climbing out of chemo fog and can actually stay focused and remember what I read but I had no idea that you have gone through this before until I started reading about your post regarding your hair. You, Interg, Janice, Hickinglady and anyone else out there that have been through this before are such amazing women! You all seem to have such good attitudes an extremely helpful advice. Thank you! Can't wait to see everyone's new styles as you post them! I'm doing like Deb and just letting it do its thing. I throw in some moose ounce in a while to control it a little.

Although I did not break any new bowling records I sure did have fun. Then I went out with the girls and drank beer and laugh and laughed. First time I let my guard down in over a year! Now of course I am second guessing myself whether I should have drank so much but it sure tasted good! I have started watching all the Marvel movies. I have gone through Phase 1 and getting ready to start Phase 2. I need to catch up with everything so that when I go watch the next batch of movies all understand more. I've been kind of just seeing them sporadically and that's why I decided to just watch them all in order. Okay I can't remember the old guy's name that wrote these movies but I absolutely love looking for him in each movie! LOL So far my favorite one is Iron Man 1 when Iron Man says hey Hughie. LOL Linda. How are you feeling? Are you liking the lymphademia machine? The only set back I can see from it is it takes up an hour a night. That is Alitalia of time for me when I work those nights. However that's probably what I needed the most because I've been cleaning and aggravating my arm. How about your trial? How is that going. Innab perhaps you should talk to your doctor and see if you can score one of those machines. They do work like a charm. Mine was covered by insurance. You may want to check into it. It really does help my arm a lot. My eye brows are thinner and s couple of weeks ago my eye lashes started falling out only to be replaced by stubby ones. A girlfriend is ordering some stuff to help with my eyelashes to become thicker and longer. Will let you ladies know how that works out. My hair started straight like yours and then started curling. It'll be interesting what yours ends up doing. Hope your feeling better now that your getting the right treatment for what is wrong with you. Thanks for the selfie you're adorable! Engine sounds like Janis is doing a little better with physical therapy. How freaking frustrating. You just get out of doing a cancer treatment for a whole year and you go into physical therapy because of a fall. I hope she's becoming stronger throughout therapy and feeling. Also, hope you are doing well too. GaWarrier congrats on your exchange surgery. Hope things are doing well for you and not in too much pain. How long are you off work? From the looks of your picture your nose is healing quite nicely. How us Brycr feeling? Hopefully you both are getting stronger every day! I would have definitely participated in that wine drinking after everything you've been through. ;) Undrago good to read that you are finally getting back on board on your trial and it's working out for you. I bet you can hardly wait till you're done and you can actually take a break from all this. Your little grandbaby is absolutely adorable! I am going to check out the Awakening that you were talking about. It sounds like some pretty positive quotes to read. Interg this might be a little late but yes I still have burning, tightness, and just plain uncomfortableness in the breast that I had the lumpectomy done. I have also noticed if I don't stay on my stretching everyday that courting tries to surface again. The gal that set me up with the machine showed me a great stretch up against the wall with my hands that when I first started doing it was kind of painful cuz it was so tight but now that I do it every day it seems to get looser and looser. I believe I read somewhere word gal said that her worst pain was the first two years after her surgery and then it started fading out. I had to giggle when I saw your statement about picking up a little something from Colorado. LOL Deb you mr fur baby is so cute and cuddle looking. Glad to hear you're enjoying your new job. I have been doing job interviewing on top of everything else to try and get a higher-paying job so I can stop working two jobs. My only problem is is I don't have a degree. It really pisses me off that I am overlooked because I chose to go to work, and not go to school. I have over 30 years experience in the accounting world and it doesn't mean diddly-squat because I don't have accounting degree. I tried to go get one when I was in my forties but it's just too hard to keep my house hold a float, work two jobs and go to school. Now I'm 56 and I have no desire to go back to school. Good gravy by the time I get my degree because I won't be able to go back full time, I will only be able to do it part-time I'll be ready to freaking retire!! LOL Frog I have always wanted to learn to belly dance ! How is that going? I bet it is so fun. Duffy. WOW! That us really is good news! Sucks that you have to do repair surgery for that. Hopefully it's not too painful. Glad you had a wonderful vacation and got to relax! Batata best of luck with your new Mo tomorrow! For all I know it's already happening because it's midnight here in Wyoming. As far as your arm and your rib cage feeling like you do. Pt and massage is definitely going to help that. Also stretching Faithfully every single day. It's pretty painful and it takes a while it's not an overnight fix by any means. If I forget to do my stretching I feel it for sure. Perhaps you can ask your new doctor about that machine that I use to pump the fluid out of my arm and back into my core. It truly does help! I completely understand what you're talkin about about not wanting to get a scan. My OC does a blood test every 3 months. He's feeling is that he'll keep an eye on my blood and if he sees anything going on with my protein levels then I'll do a scan. My next one comes up in April as well as my first mammogram on my breast that I had the lumpectomy. Working two jobs absolutely sucks! However, you are right by saying at least we have the energy to do that again. I get that you're super stressed. It would drive me crazy having to switch doctors in the middle of all this. I also wanted to let you know that my Mo told me that if my anastrozole was not cooperating with my body and too many side effects there are several other pills out there. Perhaps maybe you can get switched over to something that works for you without such bad side effects. Hoping this new Mo works out for you and you can finally find a little bit of peace. :) Deleon it sounds like you've got most of your questions answered. The only one I can't see maybe someone saying anything about is the port. I was so thankful I had my port, even though I hated it the whole time I had it cuz it was so uncomfortable. But now that I'm doing zometa infusions and having to have them put an IV in my arm every 6 months and draw blood every 3 I am very glad I had a port! Sorry that you had to join the group. Hope you find as great a group out there as what I did when I started all this. This group of women and gent are awesome! Okay sorry if I missed anyone. I am totally going to stay up on this board for now on because I sure did I have some serious catching up to do. I think of you guys everyday and I peek in and read stuff when I have a minute. I've said it before and I'll say it again you all brought peace into my world when you came into my life. I truly wish that someday we can all meet in an area in this world that will work for everyone. :) Have a great week!",

However looking at the drift in front of my car, it's probably a good thing because it is going to take a while to dig out. Did I mention how much I hate shoveling!! Linda I wish there was a way I could show you a stretch that the gal brought my machine to my house showed me. I can try and explain it. I stand sideways by a wall and put my hand on it open Palm with fingers facing up. I stand there and hold that stretch and count to 20. Then I will turn my hand to either the right or the left palm spread out still on the wall and stretch it that way and then I will do it the opposite way with my hands the opposite direction palm stretched out. I did this every single day and within 2 weeks my cording went away. I've also Incorporated stretching my arm all the way up on the wall and just kind of leaning and and that stretches underneath my armpit into my core body. These stretches I did not learn from physical therapy. So I thought I would share them with you just in case they haven't showed you them either. Stay warm!",

I just haven't really felt like being out in a lot of crowded public areas during all this chemo . I'm okay with going to work and I'm okay with going to the grocery store . I haven't felt like going out to restaurants because I never know what I'm going to like or tolerate . I just wanted to be a Hermit or be around only close friends. I think I'm just a little depressed and frustrated. Dealing with hand/foot syndrom has made matters even worse because now I can't even go out and walk and just clear my head. Having said all that my boyfriend is getting frustrated with me. Just tonight he tried to talk me into going downtown to a outside concert. It's 5 hours long, it will be crowded. I told him I was not up to it that. I did not sleep well last night and I just wanted to go home and relax. His friends want us to go to Sturgis this year. We all plan that last year and they're still pushing for it. I told him last night that I wasn't going to go that he could go if he wanted too but I just didn't think I would be up to that large of a crowd. I'm also wondering if it was his friend's wife that was going through all this would he still be pushing to go to Sturgis? Grrr. So do you think I am sabotaging myself by not getting out and doing things? I am very tired and can barely make it through 6 hours of work a day. I can't stand to be on my feet very long because they get red hot and I can't really walk on them until this goes away. I think he thinks because my last chemo was last Thursday that I should be ready to go. I'm not. I'm overly tired and just flat depressed. I never tell him I dont want him to go. I know it's not fair for me to have him sit around at my house because I don't want to go anywhere. Are you guys getting out and doing social events? Does it help with the depression? Do I need to push myself out into the public again?",

He talk to me about hot flashes and joint pain. Said that I needed to move every day for about 30 minutes and that would help with the joint pain. Of course I had to peek in on future boards and read how some women have insomnia and emotional mood changes as well as joint pain and hot flashes. I have chosen to take mine in the evening hours right after dinner as I take a Synthroid in the morning. However I also found on the board where women are taking it with minimal side effects. Let's hope we are one of those women! Now we get to compare our SE's with one another. ;) I also received a zometa infusion for bone protection. Will you be receiving those as well? I have to get one every 3 months for 3 years. ",

You are a very strong women and a wonderful mother. Your picture is so heartwarming. Glad to hear your about done with chemo world! Maybe after you get away from that you will start getting more energy and be able to keep nutrients in you as well. FDwithfurkids. On top of kicking soy out of your life. Which is really hard because everything has it in there. I feel like I can't completely get it out. However I can make it less abundance. Even chocolate. :( Having said that, have you heard if anti-aging facial cleansers and lotion are bad for you as well? Good gravy does one have to completely purge everything in their world and start over after they get breast cancer? By the way I really do love your sign on name. I'm such a fur baby lover myself. Best of luck with your scan coming up! Undergo and Frog Good luck with surgery consultant. Also, thanks for checking in Frog! Duffy. Thank you for sharing that information regarding port. It relieved some axiety. You would think after surgery and chemo I would be a lot less anxious about such a little procedures. , really need to consider taking those anxiety pills. Especially to sleep at night ;) Bobby7056. I did DD Taxel every 2 weeks. I also did the neulasta shot with it. Not going to lie, the bone and joint pain is miserable. The only thing that would calm it down for me was hydrocodone. However my taste buds started coming back around to where I could taste some of my food. Bonus! I started icing during taxol due to hand and foot getting worse. Energy level seem to be less and less each treatment. Been done for 3 weeks now energy level is starting to come back slowly but surely. Engine WOW! You wife is one tuff cookie for sure! Prayers for fast healing so she does not have to get off schedual with chemo so she can be done. InnaB2016. If your starting taxol that means you have four more to go! Believe it or not the last for treatments seem to go fairly quickly for me. I hope that is the same for you as well. I will also say my last one probably knocked me on my but the hardest. But I am starting to come back around slowly but surely. ;)",

      "Content": "Jul 22, 2018 12:33PM - edited Jul 22, 2018 12:41PM by LIFE1963 Hello Everyone. Got my port taken out last Thurs. It was done in her office. Took about 45 mins. Dr. said my port had worked up higher into my neck area than usual so it took a little more tugging to get it out. It was a little sore that night and I put some ice on it, Duffyn suggested that. It's now Sunday I have showered on Saturday and I no longer have to wear a gauze Band-Aid. I just have strips of tape that will wear off in time. Some bruising. Told to watch for redness, could be sign of infection. But so far everything is good! The little odds and ends pains and corks that I was feeling when on chemo is starting to go away. I do still have a little neuropathy cotton ball feeling between my toes but my hands seem fine. I still have that weird sensation going on in my face hoping that goes away in time as well. My taste buds are still kind of not so happy with certain food. I have noticed that my nails have stopped peeling back as far as they were. Perhaps now they'll just start growing out along with my hair. I just went and saw my mom and dad last weekend for the first time since starting chemo. My dad had to do chemo as well for lung cancer. He started one week before I started mine. He's 83. He seems to be doing really well. He taste his food, his neuropathy is going away, he still struggles a little with foggy brain and tiredness. And his hair is already grown 2 inches! Sooo Jealous! ;) Next stop with radiation Dr to get fitted for body cast tomorrow. Then we will make finally decision on when radiation starts. Engine how is Janice feeling? GaWarrier good to hear from you. Glad you doing well! InnaB2016 when do you start taxel? Do you have to get nulesta shot with it? The entire 4 treatments that I did with taxol I was never nausea or constipation. Icing my feet and hands truly helped with that hand-foot syndrome as well. I also took Vit B100 and B12 along with LGlutimin powder for 6 days after treatment. I also agree with soy controversial being very confusing!! I asked my MO at my very first consultation opt about soy causing cancer. His answer was there has never been a medical study to prove that soy causes cancer. However, recommended highly that I changed my diet to fresh fruit, vegetables chicken and fish with lean red meat only a couple of times a month. His opinion is everything in moderation is not bad for you. However, when I started going through my cupboards I discovered that I was buying more process junk that really had no nutritional value at all. I have cleaned out my cupboards since then. I do realize just like FDwithfurkids said \"You can't get it completely out of your diet\". With all the opts and treatments out there hope all are doing well and having a nice relaxing weekend. ",

Your hair has gotten long! Longer than mine for sure. So you're hiding your face on all your pictures but I can tell by a side view that you are smiling. Just like your little statement says. Mine is coming in salt and pepper. My nails are doing okay but when they grow back their growing kind of wavy so I've been keeping them short still. So I had a panic attack on the radiation table this past Monday. Today the radiation doctor talk to me about it. I told her about one of my neighbors and it's got me a little freaked out. She talked to me about how she realizes that I have lost some things during these treatments. She said it's true I will never be the young, vibrant woman with strong bones and excessive energy again. She also explained to me that everything I'm feeling would be a naturally progression with menopause . I am just feeling it sooner because it has been brought on by medical treatment . She said I can choose to grieve that and hold onto that grief or I can embrace it as a new chapter in my life. She recommended keeping stress levels down, eating healthy, plenty of rest, protecting my arm from lymphedema and just living my life looking forward to each day. I didn't tell her that I was grieving my youth, I was just telling her what happened and how it it stressed me out. But I feel that her advice is very good because I am grieving it. I am going to try my best to put a smile on my face and not try to think so much negativity. Radiation I have 18 more to go. Tomorrow I go in for my CT scan and map for the Boost that they'll do for the last 8 treatments. Hoping I can stay healthy to get through these next 18 treatments without any delay! Then it's back to my OC for my second treatment of zometa. I am going to ask him if he is going to do a bone density test as I will be on annastozole 3 months so of October 17th. DebAl good for you on going part time. I too am looking at cutting my part-time job down some so that I'm not working so much during the month. I would like to quit it but I looked at my finances and that's not going to happen since they're raising our health insurance, retirement and dental premiums next year. GaWarrier when is your surgery? Well time for diner and RR. Check back soon!",

Me, lately I find myself throwing on a pair of sweats, jeans a sweatshirt no makeup because I have a beard on my face and I don't want to bring attention to it. Have not had any jewelry on lately and I sell Paparrozi Jewlery on the side. I'm either tired, depressed or just being a slacker. GaWarrier thank you for the advice. You are right on nights that I don't sleep well my anxiety is way worse the next day. When is your surgery scheduled? I can't quite remember if you posted a date about that or not. My mind is definitely not as keen as it used to be. Innab I'm with you and Gawarrior. I was actually very depressed when the weather started turning cold because I feel like I had no summer at all. I got to go four-wheeling for a week and a half so I shouldn't be complaining but it wasn't all that warm out there that week. And then when it started warming up I got into radiation and was told to stay out of the sun as much as possible. Now we're having weird weather, 65 one day and 20 the next. Brrrr. PS who wants to behave. Lol Duffy thank you for sharing about the anxiety your experienceing. I feel less alone now on that subject. I believed I have shared with you guys a while ago that I have anxiety taking different medications. I think it's just because I live alone and I never know how I am going to react. It could just be that I don't like that out-of-control feeling not able to be alert if necessary. Ya I will think if any excuse. However, I do believe I'm probably going to have to get past that as I get older because one does need their sleep and anxiety sucks! Undrago. Hope you're having a nice relaxing weekend just chilling out and not having any issues to deal with. Good to hear you get your drains out on Monday. Engine that's going to be a major culture shock when you go from relaxed California sunshiny weather to Chicago. BRRR! Your right why most people seek out warmer climates to retire in you guys are going the opposite. It reminded me of a movie I saw one time called \"Go East\" A comedy about a bunch of settlers that during g a time where everyone else is heading West they decide they don't like the West so they head back East. DebA I hope you're out there enjoying your vacation! My hair is growing still but now it's starting to get a little wild looking like I have a cowlick and hair sticking straight up in the back. Talk about Bed Head look. LOL  Have a wonderful weekend!",

Lol Engine good to hear that this fire is not so close to your home that you are having to evacuate. Glad you're both safe! I have never heard of the type of surgery that your friend is having. GA Warrior and DebAl you both look fantastic! I bet it was so cool to just sit and chit chat face to face! Lucky chicks! InnaB you look so cute ringing your bell! Congratulations for being done! I've been thinking about what you said as far as taking the antidepressant. I started seeing a counselor and talking things out we'll go from there. Frog. Congratulations on having enough hair to actually get unruly! LOL my hair is long but curly curly curly in the back and straight as an arrow in the front. My bangs are taking their sweet time coming in. I was kind of getting discouraged and then I saw DebAl's picture and her bangs are just a little bit longer than mine so I guess I can just settle down cuz she's been done with chemo way before me. LOL Undrago you started radiation today sounds like you've got a heck of a schedule with the holidays in between but in a way that's kind of a blessing cuz it'll give your skin time to heal a little before they hit it again. I know when I had to take time off for that week that I had a cold my skin started healing very nicely. And then she decided to do my Boost because my underarm was getting so red which gave it a chance to settle down. Interg how was Disney?! I believe I read somewhere that you are getting ready to take anastrozole. I was taking it at night, when I first started taking it I did have side effects. I had a headache I was nauseated little dizzy and pain and insomnia. However about 2 months into it the dizziness went away the headaches went away in the insomnia went away. My only problem is that my joint pains not going away. However everyone is different! I have started taking mine in the morning now hoping that the side effects are less in the evening hours while I'm trying to sleep. Keep me tab then how you're doing. :-) DJT, Maggie, Duffy, Notered and Hikinglady hope your all doing well! I am getting ready to finally go get my ultrasound for my liver enzymes. The insurance denied the CT scan because they want a ultrasound first. This decision of course took 3 weeks to make. Ugh! Well I'm signing off for now I hope I didn't miss anyone and if I did I'm so sorry. Think think of you all often. Still waiting to see little pictures here and there of everyone that we went through this with! 😙 Huggs to you all! 🤗",

The day of my colonoscopy one of the people I clean with was telling me her husband has to have throat surgery as they suspected throat cancer. So I have been picking up her extra shifts as well. My colonoscopy went well. The doctor said everything looks good. My esophagus looks good as well. You ladies were right. The prep is the worst part of the whole deal. I actually completely forgot that I was allowed to drink chicken broth and Jell-O so I stuck to water and Gatorade. By the time I got to the office the next day I had a really bad headache. The nurse just hooked me up to an IV with fluids right away and I felt much better. The best part was afterward when I went home and slept and slept and slept. Now you all know how great of a sleeper I am at night, NOT! So I did enjoy sleeping all day! Interg Thanks for sharing what your boss said. LOL Gawarrier - Love your picture with Linda! You guys look adorable! Great news regarding your son! So happy for you guys. You can always tell your son are famous saying on this board, one day at a time. It's what we do. Deb okay what surgery is Gawarrier talking about? Good gravy how did I miss that? Frog that's pretty cool that you got to throw a party for your son on a beach! Super jealous! Where I live there is no such thing as a beach. I also experience that prickly feeling in my skin when I get overheated or start sweating. Hot flashes are miserable right now because my skin feels prickly. Skin doctor I went to told me it was dry skin and recommended a CeraVe. She explained to me not only is it a great moisturizer but it also heals and repairs the skin. Told me that i need to use it top to bottom after getting out of the shower. I don't know if your situation is the same, but if it is you might want to give that a shot. I just went to her so I've had no time to go to the store and get this lotion so I can't verify if it works. Linda your hair looks super cute! I really like the style that you're wearing. I don't know if you had that styled or if it just happened to look that way but it looks really good! Well that's pretty awesome of you to go into trials and try different medications. I was asked if I would and to be honest with you I struggled with that. I admire you for that decision!! Undrago how much more do you have to go on rads? Are you close to being done? Speaking of RADS. Have any of you ladies that have gone through radiation and have had time now away from it been experiencing a burning sensation once in awhile in your nipple or a tingling sensation in your arm or your hand? It's not every day but every once in a while I get this burning sensation in my nipple and it freaks me out! Well I think I'm going to head to bed I'm pooped. Will check on again before the weekend starts! ",

If you're having a really bad time with it perhaps they can recommend that machine that I do. It was insurance covered for me because they showed that I needed it. It really does help especially if my arm starts swelling and getting really painful. I put it on for an hour and it feels like a whole different arm when it's over and done. I also wear my sleeve a lot when I do extra chores that I don't usually do as well. Hope it settles down for you very soon. Let me know if you want the name of that machine.

I too just went through the stage of I have to do this, I have to do that during treatment. My only problem was I kept thinking oh my gosh I'm going to all these side effects for the rest of my life, it's never going to go away. Not really ever thinking about why I was doing this until after it was all done then it hit me. Just the other day my BF was talking about getting rid of the little tiny bike they brought in for me to ride during chemo. Now let me tell you, this thing is older than the hills and on its last leg. But when he started to pick it up to carry it out I started crying. My exact words to him were what if it comes back and I don't have my bike to ride. I'm with GaWarrier, with all the anniversary year dates coming up of the different things that we went through last year, you can't help but think what if. I talked to a lady who is out 11 years. She told me the first three year were the hardest emotionally to get through. As far as joint pain, I never really had that before and I do now. I do believe it is the anastrozole. Ingerp it's probably correct on saying that yoga is probably the best thing we can do for our bodies. It relives stress and at the same time releases the tension in our muscles. Even if it's not yoga some kind of body stretch. I'm sure it doesn't help at all that your doctor keeps throwing out the words that you said he is using. That would practically piss me off more than anything! GRRR Well I better get out and start snow shoveling I'm going to try and make it over to help my girl friend, whose husband is fighting throat cancer right now, get out as well.

Went for a walk with my BF. Try to walk 30 miles a day but some days are tougher then others for sure! Have not had the bloody nose but Gawarrier I go through a box of kleneex every other day! Poor nose. Feeling numbness in my face. :( Anyone else experience this? Also, my hands and feet get super hot and the dry and peel. Any suggestion for that out there? Postiveinohio I finish my last chemo treatment on June 28th! We are pretty close on treatment plans. Duffyzmom I also do what you call \"chemo nesting\" I want everything done before I go to treatment every time. It gives me a feeling of accomplishment. ;) Astyanax66 sounds like you had a great time! That is good, helps to bring your life back to a little normacy!:) Well nice catching up with all you lovely ladies and Engine too! Good luck to all those who have upcoming treatments this week! I will be checking back to see how you all are doing. Really enjoying this group. So glad I joined!",

Most I have done is and exray and ulter sound and one MRI on my knee. Never had to go into the actual machine head first. Eck!!!

Did Oncotype DX test and my number was 44 which brings me to chemo land, 4 A/C and 4 Tax, radiation and 10 years on hormone blockers. I guess my dr will scan when done with chemo?

I agree your are truly an amazing man! I think it is awesome that you believe God has taken you through everything. I too believe his hand is here as well. Now if I could just learn to lay this at his feet and stop picking it back up. The struggle is real! Well my two fur babies are staring at me wondering if I am every going to feed them.

See Dr this Thurs before my 3(4) DD Taxel to talk with him about. Face is still a little numb but starting to get better. Hands and feet still on fire and my hands are peeling like crazy! Nurse told me they are going to wrap my feet in ice towels and hands this treatment to help alleviate all that. Wonder if they can do that for my face too. Brrrr! Duffyzman I am so sorry to hear about the loss of your fur baby. Having to say goodbye is heart wrenching to say the least. Yet the kindness act of love we can show them when it is time. Good idea on taking all those goodies to help with other fur babies waiting for their new homes. That was cool! :) Frog on the lilypad Ok first I have to say I absolutely love your nickname. It is too cute! Yes! My port causes me pain in my chest area. It really seems to hurt when I find myself stressed. I believe it is because I am not having good posture these days. Also feels very tender and bursed after each treatment. DJT. Yes I am also taking Vitimin B6. 200mg twice a day as well a a sublingual B12 every day. My Dr told me my nails would slow down on taxel. I have had 2DD and I believe they are growing like weeds! Craziness. I only have some weird sliver looking nails and brusing but nothing else. My cuticles are really dry no matter what I do. I have not put polish on. Could be to late for that as I did notice one of my nails is starting to crack inside the nail bed. Ugg! GaWarrior Good Luck with your new chemo treatments. I can't say how weekly will go but I can say that so far I am not as tired, foggy and can eat different foods now then I could on A/C. Engine Prayers all goes well with your wife's treatment this week! InnaB2018. Going to check out that show you suggested to keep up my spirits this weekend as I love comedies! Underage Hope your feeling better this week! Well it is chemo week for me so I have to get some stuff done.

Been trying to do laundry and dishes today but you would think I ran a marathon! Jimmy crickets! I am all about sharing rad information as I go through it with everyone.

Hope you wife is allowed to carry on with her treatments very soon! Feel like I am missing quit a bit out here but I am struggling with a foggy brain and exhaustion. I will revisit and try and catch up better after I start feeling more clear headed. Here is hoping SE are few and far between this week for those having an infusion.",

I am so exhausted, yet dont sleep at night, that riding my stationary bike 10 mins about knocked me out. My body pain is lingering. Between Taxel and Neulesta. Took a hydrocodone and still squirming around half the night with leg pain. Bloody dry nose everytime I blow, finger nails are almost lifted down to the middle of my finger nail. Dizziness, Did I mention exhaustion?!! Good Gravy! Why does that last one have to be so...... Ok. Enough whining. InnaB2018 That is pretty impressive walking that many miles! I had to stop walking do to Hand/Foot syndrome. That started with A/C. I iced my last two Taxels that helped out some. That would suck having to get a port for 4 treatments! Hoping your veins hold up for ya! Yes. Denver was s scorcher! That is where I go to get my treatments. Thank goodness my little Kia has air conditioning! Frog! I am so happy for you that it was benign! I would have been a mess too! Undrago71 I will be right there with ya! \"Butt Bald!\" I have not wore any makeup for awhile now. My skin in dry and tingly wear my face gets all weird when I have Taxel treatments. I figure why irritate it more. I had to stop wearing jewelry as well. Necklace would irritate my port and my finger are so not working right wear I could not even try and get earrings on. My eyelashes and eye brows are slowing but surely going going gone. I Have Heard On future boards that I have peaked in on that it all goes back fairly quickly on your face once it falls out. As long as it doesn't grow out all over my face! LOL Astyanax66 My RO has already scheaduled an opt to have port removed in 2 weeks. I was so glad to get that call. Although I am glad I had the port it constantly causes pressure and pain in my chest. Especially right after treatment. It is really sticking out as well cuz I have lost weight during all this. DJT. Those emotions will sneak up on you and before ya know it WAM! It is scary changing treatments. You get used to \"chemo world\" and then all the sudden you're in a different world. Radiation. It's all so overwhelming! InnaB2018 said it well! As far as being done with your chemo. (Congrades!) Do you feel wiped out and weak in you mussels? I find myself taking more naps then I ever did while I was on chemo. I am also finding I am struggling to do my 30 min cardio. Weak and shakey. Engine hope your wife is doing well and that her treatments are treating her better with less se's. GA Warrior hope your treatments are going well! So I have to tell a funny story. This morning I decided that I would venture out and get my yard some water cuz it's been so hot. Myself and the dogs went be-bopping out the front door in my pajamas with my bald head. A young kid was parked across the street in his car. I must have looked like something he had never witnessed before cuz he started his car and drove off very quickly after seeing me. Now this is happened twice. When I was doing AC I would get migraines. After the second treatment I remember telling myself that I need to get out and walk so out the door I went in my robes, slippers big sunglasses. Well I must have looked a sight then too because a young kid was walking down the sidewalk opposite of me he got off of the sidewalk walked almost a car length around and got back on the sidewalk. Yep! The neighbors probably think I'm the crazy lady that lives in the small house with the two dogs. LOL Well if I have missed anyone I'm sorry! I hope you all have a wonderful holiday and enjoy your family and friends. Those of you having a treatment this weekend I hope you have less SES. Those of the you that are done with chemo congratulations! Love coming to these boards and visiting with you all!",

I have probably cried more in the last 6 months then I have ever cried in my whole 54 years of life. I keep telling myself I'll just get through all this. It is just my hormones working overtime or lack of and I'll be fine. The crazy part is I don't know why? I'm still very capable of living my life. Maybe not being a big social butterfly but still can live my life. There are others out there dealing with way more than I could imagine . Perhaps you are right. I need to reach out and get some help to work through all this overabundance of emotions I'm dealing with. I don't really like to take pills of any sort because of possible reactions. It is a struggle for me. I guess sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I sat down last night and had a long talk with my BF. I thanked him for being here for me. I also told him I understood if this was also taking a toll on him as well. I reassured him that if he wanted to go to Sturgis and/or the four wheeling week camping trip that we already planned with everyone else in August that he should go. He told me that he was concerned about me. He feels bad that the whole summer was going by and that I was not getting out to enjoy some of it. I told him that I needed to take baby steps. I explained to him that not only am I dealing with physical side effects of this I also am dealing with the emotional side as well. It is very hard to look in the mirror nd not even recognize your own self. I need to get comfortable in my own skin again and feel better physically before I willing or ready to step out my comfort zone. I also admitted to him that I was depressed and that I was aware that I needed to do something about that as well. Thank you again everyone for reaching out to me during this time when you are all going through so much of your own. Each one of us have our own personal battles that we are fighting as well as this horrible disease. I have truly been blessed to have such wonderful people, that have never even met me, have such kind and encouraging words of wisdom. Mean while I have a whole list of amazons shows to check out and possibly some personal journaling to do. Hope you all are having a good weekend!  ",

Not sure what's going to happen there. He still thinking about whether or not September would be too far out. His feelings are that medical studies have only studied 3 to 6 weeks not 7 to 8 so he can't really give me a medical opinion on that. Radiation doctor said it would be fine to start September due to a vacation that we have planned. However it is a four wheeling vacation with a lot of bouncing and I don't know if my body could even handle it. I am going to do some soul-searching before I make this decision. Kind of scary going past the 6-week mark after what he said. Hope everyone is doing well! :-)",

My MO told me to use this cream (Urea 20 or 10% cream) and put on lose cotton sock socks and gloves. I also got a stand up fan and will turn that on at night when it hits. I am huddled up under z blanket except my feet. Lol. I also found that if I get up and cool my feet in the shower or ice them under a big bag of frozen peas that seemed to calm it down as well. They did tell me to keep my walking to a minimum as the pressure will irritate your feet worse. I ride a stationary bike for excirsise. I also found a super light weight sandal to wear that kept my feet cool during the day. Also, I did start icing during my infusion on my 2nd taxel because it got so bad. That helped slow it down My hand are better and my feet seem to not be as irritated now either. As far as exhaustion. That hit me on my last AC treatment and followed right into the taxol. Never really got my energy back period 3 weeks out I'm starting to feel a little bit better but still kind of tired and wear out quickly. Message me or chat if you want to discuss further. Best to you!",

Undergo I just counted my eyebrows on my face and I have a whopping 10 on the right side and a little more on the left. Chunks of eyelashes missing. Ugh! You said you're using something on your eyebrows, brushing them in? My SO made the statement last night that they'll will grow back and probably be so thick I'll have a unibrow!! GaWarrier hope your blood count gets itself straightened out soon. I did okay through most of my treatment until the last one where my liver enzymes were showing too high. I go back August 13th to have it redone. I was told to stay away from alcohol, and red meat. I was so going to have a beer during Frontier Days! LOL InnaB2016. Best of luck to you tomorrow that your veins cooperate and you can get the second half of your treatment going. Will be thinking of you. Still struggling with a face that doesn't feel right. Yep I'm one of the ones that have the off the wall numbness of my face. It still feels weird. Last night my SO said my nose was cold. I could not feel it. I really hope that comes back! Neuropathy in my feet is still going on. Some days they're fine and some days they feel like they have cotton balls in my toes. The other day I felt like I had rocks in my shoes and kept taking them off to shake them out. Weird. Best of luck to everyone out there this week with all that you are trying to get done!",

When I iced my feet and hands they told me because I had hand foot syndrome that I should try and Ice my entire bottom of the foot as well as the hands. What I used was ice packs underneath my feet. The first treatment I did ice packs with real ice in it. Feet got so hot that ice melted. The next time I did a treatment I just did a regular gel Frozen packs under my feet. I held onto small Gatorade bottles, tried using regular water bottles and they would defrost too fast. When we froze the water in the Gatorade bottle left the lid off so that the bottle would expand more, then put the lids back on them after they were frozen That seemed to do the trick for me if you wanted some suggestions on how to keep your extremities cold during your treatment. My treatments would last up to five and a half hours so it would last all that time. Then I would have a blanket on my lap because I was so cold. 1 down 3 to go!! :) ",

This is going to be a long one I can tell. LOL Funwithfurbabies. I am not sure what I'm looking at either but it looks like it's really good news for you! Congratulations! Looks like the cocktails that you been taking through chemo world have been working quite well. Deb and Maggie the best of luck with your surgery this week. May you both have a speedy recovery and back on your feet in no time. Engine prayers that Janice gets no fevers this week and that all is well and that she starts feeling better and better everyday! Dee are you starting with radiation next? I'm sorry if you posted this information I just didn't see anything out there. DJT and Frog how is your foot neuropathy doing? I'm still struggling with the Sensation that I have rocks in my shoes along with all the other neuropathy feelings I had throughout my body. They don't just seem to be as bad though. Maybe they're going away Inter, Duffy and Frog you guys are almost done with chemo world! Yea!! Frog how are your hands doing as well as your energy level GAWarrier that's pretty cool having a friend come and hang out. Sounds like you had a great time. My doctor approved L-glutamine and vitamin B6 the entire time I was on taxol. Claritin did not help with taxol pain. I don't know if the gluten and B6 helped with the neuropathy or not as I still struggle with some issues in that area 5 weeks out. InnaB if I'm not mistaking you should be down to two more! Yes I am the one that posted that DD taxol cause depression. I was so weepy shortly after each treatment. And the pain was crazy ridiculous. I would still have shooting pains throughout the week after the big pain was gone. It has started letting up some. I still have feet issues but I had that hand and foot and I think that just really cause that. But I feel things are getting better as far as pain. I'm going to try this acupuncture that everyone keeps talking about and see if that helps with my neuropathy as well. Undergo I didn't have any headaches during taxol but I had them really bad during AC. How many more do you have left. I developed sinus issues during AC and believe it or not they still are around. I'm 5 weeks out from chemo and glad to say my energy levels are getting better and better everyday. I struggle with a little foggy brain sleeping. Now that I'm taking anastrozole between the joint pain it causes and the hot flashes sleeping still is kind of tough. Although I did take a couple of ibuprofen last night and started drinking magnesium calm. That seems to be settling my body down some what where I can sleep a little better. However it does not help those crazy hot flashes. I really need to break down and just take something for sleeping. I told myself the other night you went through chemo you can handle a sleeping aid. LOL I'm such a sissy lala when it comes to medication. My oncologist did recommend r e l i z e n for the hot flashes. I'll let you ladies look it up and ask your oncologist. I have not tried them but believe me it's getting closer and closer every day. I have started doing rehab exercises with a lymphedema specialist to strengthen my arm that had the lymph nodes removed. I went to the gym and decided I could lift an 8 pound weight over my head and strained my arm. I guess you have to baby step back into that kind of stuff. I'm also started working my part time job again cleaning the medical facility after work at night. However, being away from that place for the last 4 months I really truly do not miss it! Another thing I've noticed. I must have just been so busy with life and working and going going going that I didn't realize that my poor little house is just packed full of nothing but junk that really needs to go find a new home! That has been my little project since I started feeling better and it is turned out to be a bigger one than anticipated. LOL I read from somebody's post along time ago that you tend to prioritize things and get rid of baggage after going through something like this. You know I'm believing it it could be true. Before I forget it was explainef to me that the reason why the nose run so bad after chemo is because we have no nose hairs. My nose has been bloody and running and dry. I have started using a product called a y r saline nasal gel. Works like a charm and my nose is almost healed up. I'm starting to get more and more fuzzies on my head and it looks like my hair is going to be coming in salt/pepper color. Also believe it or not I can see tiny little hairs where my eyebrows fell out just last week as well as teeny-tiny fuzzes on my eyelashes! Hey sorry this was so incredibly long. Had a lot to catch up on. I just want to say it was really nice to read how most of you are going to keep coming back to this board. I look forward to our futures together as we get stronger and healthier each day! Julz",

I was feeling discouraged and actually irritated the fact that I couldn't even get my own house cleaned up yesterday or my lawn mowed cuz I kept running out of energy and my arm kept starting to hurt. Mind you my house is not even that big. I told him I am sick and tired of feeling this pain. I either have it in my wrist, my arm that had surgery, my knee that had surgery or it or my back. I feel like I'm 90 years old and I am only turning 55 in a few days. I told him that the frustration is real because before all this started I was working a full-time job, cleaning a medical facility at night and then coming home and taking care of my house as well. He told me \"Yes you were working like that and you were working yourself down to the bone\" . \"Maybe this a big wake-up call for you to stop doing that and not taking on as much\". \"Give yourself a break and not be burning the candle at both ends anymore\". Of course I just looked at him and just started watching TV again. Left his house last night frustrated. However, you have made me really think about what he said. I've been feeling frustration that I have not been able to just jump back in. You know maybe you and Undrago are right. Just because you can doesn't mean you should. Maybe it is time to revaluate my lifestyle as well. Take time to smell the flowers. ",

Just when I blow there is blood. DJT hope you starting to feel better Going to make this one short. Radiation is kicking my butt! I am so exhausted and then I don't sleep at night. I really got to give up and just take a sleep aid. Kicking around taking Lexapro. Anybody out there take it? Did they get relief? Did it work? How long and how often did you take it if you did or still do. Doctor told me today that my arm looks like it's swelling and that I have a small case of Lymphedema starting. Told me to elevate my arm every night, where my sleeve when I clean the medical facility and wear it at night when I sleep when my arm is achy. Darn it I tried to do everything I could to avoid that! It really bummed me out. I still have five and a half weeks of radiation to go! UGG I got to say I'm really enjoying seeing pictures of different people out here! Looking forward to seeing more of different people as well as the same. Well I made a commitment to myself that I was going to take something and try and get some sleep tonight. So I guess I better get off of line and get that done. Thank you all for the wonderful birthday wishes!",

It took awhile to get my energy and appetite and bearings back. Also took a while for the pain to go away. Now having said all that it does go away. It does get better. When I finished taxol I felt like I was walking on rocks in my shoes and that feeling is starting to subside every day. I would wake up with shooting pains in my legs and I'm not doing that anymore. My face was numb and it is completely back. Just thought I'd give you some hope that you will start feeling better! Enjoy your weekend everyone this radiation is wiping me out and believe it or not it's 7:40 and this cat is eating dinner and going to bed. I think I'm going to try Sleepytime tea tonight with honey. Fingers crossed that I sleep at least 6 hours or more before I wake up. I will try the other suggestion this weekend when I am not having to get up for Rads or work.",

My last treatment I delt with pain for close to 4 weeks. Lack of energy and just an over all not feeling good. The only thing that helped was hydrocodone with the pain. I would try not to take every day but usually gave in at night. Yes I remember many nights where I would be kicking my legs around because they would be in so much pain and yes it would bring me to tears as well . The pain and the frustration. I would also put long socks on my feet up to my knees to try and keep my calves warm. I don't know if you're having calf problems but I did then and I still am. Another thing I would do is gently stretch the area that was hurting or massage it. Sometimes it helped sometimes it didn't. Now I am taking anastrozole. I don't know if you will end up taking that. That is causing joint pain in my wrist my knees and my ankles. I have noticed it is worse in the knee that I had surgery from a volleyball injury years ago on as well as my arm that I had my lymph nodes taken out of. At this time I am only allowed to take Ibuprofen because my liver enzymes are showing High. So I have been using Lanacane rub or a TEI- Fu lotion my chiropractor gave me. Another wonderful thing I've noticed over the weekend is I'm starting to grow a beard!! I'm going to have to ask my OC if this is how it's going to be and do I need to sign up for a circus for the bearded woman if it continues. By the way sorry about continuing messing up your appointments and everything that's going on with you. Seems like every time I ask you a question I'm like weeks ahead or totally off key. Really liked my birthday present by the way.😄",

How many treatments of rads are you doing. I am doing 33. I have 8 left. My skin has a small rash underneath the arm pit but that is it so far. Undrago sounds like your healing nicely! My under arm was starting to feel better then radiation came along and now I am numb again and feeling the burn. Still do my stretches every night. Slowly but surely you will start getting stronger and stronger. Are you doing rads as well? Well I'm off to bed. Should have been in bed a couple hours ago but I found myself cleaning house instead. I have to work late at my cleaning job tomorrow night because they are doing free mammograms from 5 to 8 so we can't clean until after. I'll probably regret staying up and cleaning my house tomorrow right now it feels great. LOL Hugs to you all out there!",

I worked through all the side effects and they are getting less and less to where I can handle this pill and now this. Grrrrr. So back to the OC in Denver to see what he thinks. Frog glad to hear that your anxiety is getting better! Innab that is an awful lot to take on. I couldn't imagine having to deal with all of that on top of everything else. Hope you're doing well with radiation and your cording is getting better and better everyday. I am actually scheduled to have a massage sleeve sent to me at the end of the week to avoid the lymphedema that keeps trying to poke its ugly head up. GA Warrior will be thinking about you tomorrow. Best of luck to you with your surgery! One more thing you can check off the list. Enjoy those painkillers an dx relaxing and binging on Netflix. Let us know how your doing when you feel up to it. DebA welcome back! Sounds like your vacation is just what the doctor ordered. Glad to hear about your hair growing and wow a blow dryer! I forgotten what they even sound like. LOL Well I have two more radiations to go. Looking forward to Monday when I can say that I'm done and check that off my list. Everyone have a great day and a wonderful weekend. Huggs!",

He's going to give it a couple more months and then read the blood test again. We went through my checklist he said most of my ailments probably have been caused by chemo and radiation. He said it is going to take awhile for my body to readjust and heal. He is going to do a bone scan because I pointed out to him that I'm on Anastrozole and he has never done a baseline to keep track of how well my bones are handling it. Also setting me up for my next zometa infusion on the 12th and my mammogram on my left breast. I havr to wait 6 months before I could have my right breast checked as it would show nothing but radiation burn. I also get to do my first colonoscopy. Let me tell you ladies and gents I'm so not looking forward to that!! I have been struggling because this is about the time of year that they discovered my cancer. It was December 28th. I feel like there are events that are happening in my life that are similar to what happened last year. Nothing medical just different events that I was doing that led up to December 28th. My dad was diagnosed with lung cancer a week before we discovered mine. He got a clean CT scan last week which was such a relief. It also made me realize that I just need to stop looking at every little event in my life the way I have been. We are so super slammed at work that I am just coming home exhausted. That is also be because I'm still not sleeping. I told the oncologist I was waking up in pain. I asked him if it could be the anastrozole and he told me that most likely my body was just trying to work through the chemo treatments and radiation. Really enjoying seeing all these photos of you lovely ladies out there! Beautiful pictures! Love the color of your hair Duffy! A little jealous over here because I'm soooo dark! Well there's a ton of things that need to be done tonight because tonight is my night off from my cleaning job so I'm going to get started on some of it. Hope you all have a wonderful week! Happy Hump Day! Huggs  ",

When the gal dropped off the machine and showed me how to use it she also showed me a stretch to help with cording. It helps a lot. You stand by a wall and put your hand on the wall and put a little pressure on it while you're feeling the stretch. I usually count to 20, then you change the position of the hand toward the right keeping the fingers and hand stretched and then count to 20 and do that on your left. Now I don't even know if that makes sense what I just typed that's the best way I can describe it and I can't figure out how to take a picture to show you. LOL Deb I agree we are all okay in our own little worlds! The next time somebody gives me s*** about saying the wrong word, not making sense or making up my own words, I'm just going to look at them and say you are slacking and just need to keep up with me! 😂 Ingerp Yes! When my eyelashes first came back shortly after they fell out they came back long and beautiful. I was so excited that I finally had really long beautiful eyelashes for the first time ever! However slowly but surely those long eyelashes are falling out and being replaced with little stubbles. Just the other day I found five of them on my face. How is Anastrozole treating you? Okay ladies/gent I FINALLY decided to break down and take something for my lack of sleep. I chose to take a half of A lorazepam. At first I didn't like the feeling but once I got past that I was COMPLETLY relaxed! I slept so good last night and I am so relaxed today. Now I'm having to ask myself why did I stress so bad about taking that during chemo and radiation? I'm such a wimp when it comes to pills. I'm slowly but surely starting to learn that every once in awhile you just need a little help. Well today I think I'm going to tackle the Christmas tree. I always like to decorate my house. I've been kind of lazy about it these last couple years so I just decided I was going to do it today. After all it's cold and nasty and there's football to be watched! Hugs to each and everyone of you! Have a wonderful rest of your weekend.",

Glad to here Bryce is doing good. Linda - I too thought it was a complete Overkill but I find that if I use my arm a lot it does start swelling under the armpit up into the elbow area. I have found that if I am faithful on it at least three or four times a week that swelling goes down. Right now I'm taking up working out to get my arm strength and so I am using it every night after that. I literally lay on the couch fire it up and go to sleep. LOL InnaB That would be very frustrating not to be able to get in right away. Keep us tabbed on whatever you find out. Deb how are you liking you new job? So I have started going back to the gym to try and get some strength back in these old bones. Like I said I'm setting myself up for a bowling tournament March 3rd and I really want to make sure that I'm able to do it. It feels so good to get back into the gym! And I used my little machine Faithfully because my arm definitely starts swelling. Okay I don't know if you have seen the movie Inside Out. I watched it last night. I recommend it. It really makes one think. Yet it is such a cute movie. Okay signing off for now. Have a wonderful week ladies and gent. Huggs",

My brother carried on though about how I look like a grandma now and I'm his younger sister and so I better be getting to dying my grey hair so that I don't look older than he does. I'm just not ready to dye it. I'm not really ready to do anything with. I figured it sacrificed a lot last year so I'm just going to let it do its own thing for a while. I had super super tight curls but as I've let it grow longer the curls are getting looser and a little bit more bouncier. However I'm really starting to think I look like the 80s child with a short fro! Lol Ingerp - I know you really hate your tight little curls. I know in order to get past that you're probably going to have to just let it grow out. That's a struggle though I get it. Like I said I feel like I look like the 80s child right now. LOL. So you're almost done with treatment? Great news in itself! How is Anastrozole treating you? I don't seem to be having a whole lot of problems since I changed it to taking it in the mornings. But I've also incorporated into my life vitamin D, magnesium, vitamin B and C. I don't know if it's helping but I know my sleep is getting better at night and my joint pain isn't quite as bad. I've also started circuit training in the mornings at 5:30 cuz that seems to be the only time I can get it done. LOL Undrago so sorry about your kids losing their cousin. That would be tough to deal with. Hope you're doing good on your treatments. I am sorry I forgot how many more you have. Duffy good luck with all the trails you getting involved in. Hope you're doing well. DebAl WOW! That is a lot to contend with. I'm not even sure what to say. I was floored when I read about your friend, 25 years?! I'm sorry for the loss of your other friend as well. Glad to hear job is going well and you enjoyed your vacation. Friday was my day to get my blood tested for tumor marking. Won't know anything until either Tuesday or Wednesday. Just kept myself super busy this weekend. Tackled the yard work today and yesterday. Bowled on Friday night. Now I'm just so tired I just want to go to bed. I am with GaWarrier on this. My doctor's appointment was just like how you feeling? Okay let me check your breasts, okay well if you don't hear from us then that means everything's good. See you in 3 months. Definitely was asked a lot more questions last year and even my last appointment in Dec. I guess that's really kind of a good thing in a way because that means they're not concerned about anything. Right? I wish I could get so calm about it. Hugs to you all. I am sorry if I missed anyone out there. Everybody have a wonderful week and I'll check back in very soon. ",
