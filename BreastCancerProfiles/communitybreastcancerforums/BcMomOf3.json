I started capecitabine (Xeloda) a few months ago and it has been going well, the mets in my liver actually have disappeared!! The only issue is that I am having severe skin peeling on my hands and feet.  The skin is all peeled away, I have blisters on my feet, and it is as if I have tiny papercuts all over my hands... it is extremely uncomfortable. I know this is a common side effect  but was just wondering how women who have used xeloda dealt with it this side effect. Did you stop it for a while, find a cream, anything to make it stop?? Any advice you can offer would help. I have had issues with chemos working, and this one finally seems to do the trick. I don't want to stop, or change the dosage since we are having success, but at the same time am not sure how long I can continue like this. Please let me know.",

I am now faced with a decision to either go back to tamoxifen (which we are not sure if it worked before because I was pulled off of it quickly),  go to navelbine,or look for other alternatives. As much as I would love to give my body a break from chemo, what worries me is that the onc. says it will take 3 months or more to see if the tamoxifen is working. Unfortunately 3 months of letting the cancer grow with nothing wont be good. I could also go on navelbine. So far I have been on  adriamycin + cytoxan, taxol, tamoxifen (only a few weeks because of hysterectomy), arimidex, faslodex, Avastin and abraxane, Xeloda,IXempra, Gemzar (currenly on). None of these chemos have worked and I am apprehensive to try navelbine because I dont want to put my body through that with little chances of success. I was hoping to see if anyone like me has had little success with other chemos and maybe more succes with  navelbine.  Also, those that are on navelbine, how are the side effects??  Thanks!

      "Content": "BcMomOf3 wrote: When I was diagnosed I was stage III, but the second opinions I have seen actually believe that I was stage IV at diagnoses. I had a breast lump and I went for a mammogram. They told me it was fatty tissue. I then went a year later and that was when I had the diagnoses, same lump, not fatty tissue. At the time they said I was stage III. There was a spot on my arm during the PET scan but they said it was arthritis. I told them I didn't have arthritis. They said sometimes women do and they don't know it. Stupid me, I believed it. I did chemo, radiation, double mastectomy,hysterectomy (since i'm estrogen positive), tamoxifen. My doctors thought I was crazy. They told me I could just do chemo and a lumpectomy. I told them absolutely not, I wanted to be proactive. After I had my ovaries removed they took me off tamoxifen and put me on arimidex. My scans meanwhile had come back all clear. About a year later I started to have terrible pain in my hips. The doctors said that because of the chemo and arimidex my \"arthritis\" had gotten worse. They gave me pain pills, sent me to therapy for it, chiropractors, you name it. After 9 months of complaining, I was re diagnosed. To begin with they missed the diagnoses. My daughter and I do not have the BRAC gene but I still worry about her. So for all of you that were diagnosed early, whats the trick. I know mammograms, self exams, etc, I will also always encourage my daughter to question everything, but what else. How were you diagnosed early? I worry about my daughter to because she has breast implants.

We are now just praying and waiting for a miracle, and to have everyones support on here, especially while you all are dealing with the disease, is incredible.   I so often kick myself for not being proactive enough and appreciate all of your stories. When I was diagnosed I just never imagined that it could happen to me. I had no risk factors, family history, etc. When i got the diagnoses it was like someone kicked me in the gut and threw a paper bag over my head, I was blind, sick to my stomach, and had no idea what I was doing. I was referred to the doctor who was supposedly the best in my area. I thought they would take care of me, but at the end of the day the only person who can take care of you is yourself. When I was re diagnosed everyone treated me like a hypo condriac (sp?) and a pill popping junkie because of the amount of medication I required to get me through the day. I got lectures from my doctor about the number of pills for pain management, and was told they would not prescribe them to me anymore unless i went to physical therapy, because it was just \"arthritis\". However the therapy was too damn painful. Finally my GP sent me for additional tests, not even my oncologist!   When someone's telling you your a hypochondriac and that you are okay, I thought I was going crazy. I just decided to deal with the \"arthritis,\" and take the good news. I thought that maybe I was so worried about being re diagnosed that I couldnt see the positive light and be happy that I was okay. At the end of the day we need to continue to fight and demand answers even if they are not what we want to hear. If I had demanded they look further into the \"arthritis\" who knows where I would be. At the end of the day I cannot change the past, I just hope my story helps my daughters and other women.  I really appreciate your stories as well.  ",

I have a lot of pain in my liver, my back is sore, I'm not really able to eat or keep anything down and the doctors have said that I have a month left. I don't have much strength but don't want to give up. A couple people mentioned trying high dose estrogen. I was ready to try protocel but don't think I could keep that down since it is liquid. I have been reading about high dose estrogen and read that high dose estrogen has some bad side effects but that taking a dose of estrogen at .06% had the same results a a high dose, with less side effects. Someone mentioned taking estrogel which is a gel you can rub on your arm. That might be good for me since I don't have to swallow anything. I am just wanting to gather people's information and experience about taking estrogen for ER +. If anyone has had success or has not, please let me know. Let me know your experience, side effects, anything, why you decided to try it, if you went back on tamoxifen, how long you have been on it, anything! I am trying to gather as much information as possible. If anyone was at the end like I am and took it and it gave them more time, please let me know.  A while ago my doctors said that high dose estrogen wasn't the way to go. I can't remember why. I know its controversial but I assume that they just wanted something more aggressive. I want to know if anyone on here has tried estrogen in my condition.
