I have three more taxol treatments left and will be having a double mastectomy in September. Are there any pointers or helpful tips you could give me? Also, this is right in the middle of high school football season so I was curious how long you're confined to your house. I'm one who goes to my kids stuff no matter what. I spent my \"red devil\" days at the baseball field and the taxol is so much easier on me which has bee a Blessing! This is a picture of me with one of my best friends who has been cancer free for 13 years. She has been by my side every step of the way but only had a lumpectomy so isn't familiar with mastectomies. Praying for every single one of you on this site...<3 ....",

When I was first diagnosed I read this thread all of the time but by the 3rd A (red devil) I couldn't even look at this site without feeling sick so I stepped away for a bit buy now I'm back and loved catching up with everyone's journey. Thanks again and you're such a Blessing to so many on here. I've tried to help several ladies at the treatment center with courage with different things because we're all in this together!! There is a definite bond with all of us!! <3",
