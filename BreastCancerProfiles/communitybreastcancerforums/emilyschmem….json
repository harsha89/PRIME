    "Content": "Mar 5, 2011 08:05AM - edited May 3, 2011 05:37PM by emilyschmemily SunDiego- Regarding spread from the met site-this important, simple question is ridiculously hard to find an answer to.  Sites like [www.metastasis-research.org/]  define metastasis as only from the primary site.  However, our oncologists have told us they simply don't know but it's being researched.  My mother's liver mets probably returned in the same spot they were before, but it isn't clear.  Two of our oncs didn't recommend doing radiation to the liver because of the cell damage it causes, and because my mom also has bone mets.  But in your case, if that is the only spot, it might be a very different situation.  My mom's liver met has not spread anywhere else, not even to other places within the liver.   One benefit of not doing radiation to the spot is that a met in the liver can serve as a good \"marker\" for if treatment is working.  Wishing you the best in whatever decision you and your wife make. ~Emily ",
