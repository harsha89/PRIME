Of course I don't want friends or family (or even strangers) to experience what we have, but sometimes it just makes it seem more unfair. As an example, I have an older sister (by 9 years) who takes terrible care of herself. She smokes like a chimney, has diabetes that I believe is totally the cause of her terrible eating habits and absolutely no exercise. When I was diagnosed, she had not had a mammogram for 10 years, even though our mother had breast cancer!!!!  I was the responsible one and started having mammograms in my 30's and never missed a year. Because mine was lobular, it was not discovered until I had a small area of DCIS show up. Of course I thought my diligence had paid off and it had been caught very early. HA! The biopsy also showed ILC (never showed up on mammogram) that turned out to be 9 CM and had traveled to 2 nodes. (Yes, I guess I am still a bit *&# off about it ) Well I finally convinced her to have a mammogram this year and, you guessed it, all was clear. I love my sister very much and of course was very happy she was OK and would be absolutely devastated if she were to turn up with breast cancer. But there was a twinge of \"why me\". But, as I have learned, the answer to that question is \"why not me\"? Thanks for letting me vent Cyndi",

I live in West Seattle and there is a road with a nice walking path along side called Alki Ave that runs down to and along the beach. It was a great place to walk my dogs on a nice afternoon. It was shortly after I had decided to stop wearing my wig and my hair was still very short and I was not completely comfortable being out and about like that yet. But I figured I had to just get over it so I was out walking my 2 dogs when a carload of teenage boys drove by and one of them shouted out the window \"Oh look, 3 dog bitches\" It was a busy day and I am sure other people walking/jogging along the path heard it. I have never felt so hurt in my life. It was all I could do to make it back to my car before completely breaking down. All I could think of was everything I had gone through in the last year and really didn't feel I deserved this kind of crap. I would hope that if the young \"man\" who made the remark had any idea the journey I had just been on perhaps he would feel bad about his comment. But who know? People can be so cruel/stupid sometimes. Actually that felt good to get off my chest. I hadn't told anybody that story. I was too embarrassed.  Thanks, Cyndi ",

And congratulations on your (close to) 9 years. Can't argue with that! I have been in the slouch closet for a while now and feeling very guilty about it. I tried to pick up the exercise in the beginning, even going to a new \"rehab\" program for survivors that tries to get patients to up their physical activity to a daily basis. But I quit when the obvious super jock MD (rode his bike to work every day, loved running) said to me \"well, you know, your are a Stage 3\", when I was being a bit resistant to what he wanted me to do. It just pissed me off and I said \"do you really think I need to be reminded of that?\" Did not go back, wasn't feeling the love. I now grudgingly take my dog for walks out of guilt and keep promising myself I will dust off one of the many exercise machines in the basement and get back to business. Right. I do try to eat right and take supplements, but I have refused to curtail my wine intake. And it is definitely more than the recommended amounts.  Just not completely convinced of the connection. A bit of denial going on here I am sure. So thank you all for helping me feel like I am not being such a \"bad survivor\" because I don't do everything possible to reduce the chance of recurrence.  Save me a seat on that bus!

But the last few (or more) years I became very lackadaisical about the whole issue and naturally my arm increased in size. I just ignored it. Well a few weeks ago I ended up at the ER on a Saturday night with a 103 degree fever and a painful raging red arm. Then 3 days in the hospital on IV antibiotics. Never had this happen before. Don\u2019t ever want it to happen again!!! Now I am seeing a new LE therapist and she is threatening to wrap my arm. But she also said there was an option of using a Velcro arm wrap that I guess would be easier for me to do myself. My question is have any of you wonderful ladies had experience with these Velcro sleeve? Do they work? How horrible is traditional wrapping? My therapist said with the traditional wrapping I would have to go in every day during the week for her to re wrap me. I would have to do it myself on weekends. Is this typical? Anyway, I would appreciate any opinions or experiences you could share with me. I feel like such a newbie with all this. This whole experience has by far been the worst thing I have had to deal with since starting this journey almost 12 years ago! Thanks in advance.

Is there a way to reconnect with what brought you and your husband together in the first place? A way to tap into the friendship you must have shared through the years? I know my husband and I have had some pretty rough patches in our 30 years together (both cancer related and not) and it seems if we just hang on it eventually smooths out. I know this sound cliche and I am certainly no marriage counselor, but how about sitting down and just talking all this out. Ask that you both put aside your anger and promise not to judge what the other person has to say and really listen and then repeat back to each other what you heard the other say. I know, easier said than done. Mostly I just want to say I am sorry you are in such a sad place right now. Please know you are in my thoughts.

At my last appt my onc made the off hand comment that I was coming up on  5 years on Femara, giving me the impression that she thought that would be it. I asked her if I shouldn't be staying on it for longer with my Stage 3 diagnosis and she said so far 5 years was the standard, but we could discuss it at the time?  We then were discussing the problem with vaginal atrophy and UTI's and the possibility of using Vagifem tabs or the Estring. Her comment was that she wasn't too comfortable with using topical estrogens as my tumor was 100% ER/PR+. But perhaps when the 5 years of AI's were up I could switch to Tamoxifin which would block any estrogen that got into my system from these products. I have heard of it the other way around (tamoxifin and then AI's) but not tamoxifin after AI's.The logic makes sense to me, but I just had never heard of anti hormonals used in this sequence. Just curious. Has anybody ever gone this route?  Cyndi",

I spoke to my onc about this, she told me it was due to vaginal atrophy from estrogen depletion and  wrote me a prescription for an estring (a  flexible band that is inserted vaginally and left in place for 3 months at a time and releases a small amount of estrogen daily). It has been a God send. After using it for 8 months now, sex if back the way it used to be and UTI's are a thing of the past.     We are also monitoring my serum estradiol level every couple of months. The first few months my level went from <2 up to 25 then 21. Worried me a little, by my onc was OK with it. Just had my most recent level done and it is back down to 7. Both my onc and I are very happy with this number, although I think I will have another done in a month or so just to see if it has fallen even more. I think the theory is that it takes a while for the vaginal walls to replenish and plump up again so that the estrogen is not passing through and effecting the systemic levels.     Good luck all, this was a HUGH quality of life issue for me and has made a big difference in my attitude.      Cyndi",

Sometimes during the procedure while the machine was clanging and thumping away, there was a spot on my left hip that would seem to pulse/vibrate at the same pace as the sounds and then would stop. This seemed to happen every time the machine changed noises. Obviously my mind goes to the worst possible cause - mets to my hip that were reacting to the MRI. But when doing a breast MRI are the hips even in the field of imaging?  I know this sounds crazy, but have any of you ever experienced this?  Thanks for any input.  Cyndi DX 11/9/06 9cm ILC Stage 3A Mastectomy ER+ PR+ HR- 2/16 Nodes DD AC/Taxol Radiation Log in to post a reply",

Also had a breast exam by my doctor every year. Everything was fine. Good for me!!!!!! Then in Nov 2006 my mammogram showed a small area of micro calcs. I thought - Great I caught it early and my vigilance has paid off.  Fast forward to biopsy and lo and behold they find ILC. I am still thinking, OK, we still found it while it was still small. Breast surgeon scared the hell out of me and my husband (he had to leave the room because he thought he was going to be sick) by telling  that ILC is very sneaky and that I needed just about every screening test there was before she would operate because it could be a lot bigger. Long story short (too late I know  ) I ended up with a 9 cm  tumor and 2 + nodes. Even after the MRI and the BS knew it was at least 5CM she still could not feel the tumor even though she knew right where it should be!! I guess my point is that I hate the blame the victim game, either with ourselves or others. Breast cancer is an evil beast and an equal opportunity attacker. We do what we can and sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't. It really is all a crap shoot and we need to STOP THE BLAME GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just saying. Cyndi",

I believe the last time I went to see her (roughly 4 years ago) I asked about pumps and she wasn't too pleased with them. I think she thought they could damage the tissues more? But perhaps in 4 years there have been improvements? Would love to hear both the pros and cons of these machines. Thanks, Cyndi",
