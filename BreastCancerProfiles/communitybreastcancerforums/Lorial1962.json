He is also affiliated with SJ Hospital System. I'll be so much better when I know exactly what I'm dealing with and what the course of treatment will be. Then I can tell everyone. All this waiting is horrible. I always thought that when you were diagnosed with cancer you were immediately whisked away into treatment, no time to spare!! Lol",

I had her baby shower last week and I was hard keeping this secret. Depending on my treatment I'd like to wait until after she has the baby to tell her. She is 23 so I'm wondering when they will have her start mammograms now that I have been diagnosed. I was reading with the hormone fed bc type I have I should eliminate caffeine, sugar and alcohol, oh jeez :( but I will do anything to keep to get me healthy :) The hardest thing for me so far is figuring out how to tell my kids and my parents.

After I got my pathology report back after my surgery I went ahead and told them. After that I was not afraid to tell people and it was almost liberating since I had been keeping quiet for almost a month. I even created a website over the weekend to keep everyone up to date on my treatment. I inboxed a linked to all my female friends on Facebook over the weekend. Everyone has been so supportive, if I spur at least one person to schedule their mammogram then it's worth publicizing it like I did. Everyone handles things different was, the important thing is that you do it the way that is most comfortable to you. Here is the link to my website: lorial1962.simpl.com/",
