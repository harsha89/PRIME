A very large # of women JUST DIAGNOSED get offered antidepressants (AD's), but 5 years out? I don't get it either. Xanax & narcotic pain meds, I personally think ought to be available in small amounts, to keep for an \"as needed\" basis. One time I bought a small bottle of OTC codeine in Canada, and I never even used half of it before it expired. Sometimes, some people need something a little stronger than aspirin.",

You go ahead and let every roller-coaster emotion take over, in its own good time. You'll reach a state of equilibrium pretty fast. You did nothing wrong, to \"cause\" cancer; it is just that our cells go awry sometimes. Some researchers theorize that we all have immune systems that are fighting off little developing cancers often...and sometimes, for unknown reasons, some of those errant cells make it it past the body's natural defenses, and develop into a full-blown cancer. Please keep us posted. We really, really understand the tears, fear, dread.",

Consultation with the breast surgeon is this coming Fri the 14th. MRI the day b4. You are perfectly normal, with all the panic, fear, focusing on cancer. I feel the same way sometimes. It's so hard to ALSO work, take care of my son, take care of my pets & house. I called my PCP & upped my usual anti-depressant dose, to help me cope with all this. Amazingly, I work in cancer care and have taken care of literally thousands of people with cancer. I am more blase' about cancer than most people--and yet, when it happened to me, I fell apart just like anybody else would. Big hugs to you.",

I'm sure LE therapy will make it go away, but I don't think it is quite that fast. Can you have a little more time off from work?",

The burning pain under the whole chest skin makes me hold off on chest exercise. I do take long walks with a strong dog, with the leash tied around my waist. but chest exercises? No flippin' WAY. Neurontin is helping the burning a lot, no side effects to speak of. Doing the long walks, bicep, tricep & back exercises. But even slight pushing/pulling makes the burning come back. I respect pain as a signal to back off, so none of that for me. Yet :-)",
