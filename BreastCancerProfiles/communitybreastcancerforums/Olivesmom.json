I elected bilateral mastectomy after my diagnosis because I also found out I was BRCA2 positive. I had so-called immediate reconstruction, too. My surgeon told me having the \"immediate\" reconstruction (tissue expanders) makes the recovery more difficult than just the mastectomy itself. I was off work for 2 1/2 weeks, and couldn't wash my hair for nearly that long. But my surgeon just told me to do what I felt I could do, just not lift anything heavier than 5 lbs for six weeks. Within a couple of months I could do almost anything. But as others have explained, recovery varies widely among patients.",
