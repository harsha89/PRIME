My boobs for weeks felt/feel horrible, they just dont feel like mine ? so strange but finding the lump obviously explains the feeling,  BUT the worst feeling of all is what is going on in my head, The UNKNOWN ... What 2 do ??? MY PROBLEM thats driving me insaine .... I have 2 amazing teenagers, Adam who is 19 very sensitive, my little rock x My eldest Simon 20 who is also sensitive but quite a hard faced sort ( like his dad) lol, we are extremely close and were very open always have, I have been a single mum for 18 years and its been the best !!  lol, Hell at times BUT just amazing x as i know  they are such great boys and i am a great mum, who has always allowed them 2 live life 2 the full x.............. Problem is Do I tell my boys, when there is nothing 2 tell as yet, only that mum has found a lump, and watch their poor faces :((( as we have only just buried a precious friend of my eldest boy, who sadly cruely died of cancer aged 19 yrs old :((( so saying to my boys ...Ive found a lump like my son's friend did, will not make them not up set and worry bad, as how can I say o it will be nothing when my boy heard that via his friend to then bury him 6 months later :(( ........... I am also in a very new relationship, his name is Paul, great guy we have already had our up's and down's but were getting through, learning each other every day  :)) BUT NOW,  .......AGAIN!!! what do i do, with the relation i so enjoy being in, Ive just woken up from a dream........ that im going for the scan, Paul  (my boy friend) is down stairs waiting in a different corridor of the hospital, just when im due to go into the room, The nurse started acting strange dodging me asking 2 go and get paul, BUT eventually I find out  paul has left and gone home,  I Try 2 ring him etc but no answer ??? so a friend has 2 come and get me, and in the dream the drive home takes so long, it all seemed so real ??  but confusing as in my dream didnt go in2 the room for the scan, eventually I end up in paul's house asking why he left but he is silent and looks so scared so small, and i feel so sick and cruel as im doing this 2 him,........Then i wake with tears in my eyes as Im doing this 2 him :(( God my head is all over the place im fighting back tears as im not scared my self, im totally numb, Im scared for all around me ???  I just dont know what 2 do, do i run away now and free paul from what could be ?? as just these 2 weeks I know are going 2 be so hard as already I quickly got off the phone this evening, as I want 2 be alone a bit 2 take it in, 4 what could be and prepare my self.  O i dont know  2 be honest ?? It could be a cyst and i pray so much that it is, even though breast cancer is rife in my family ( my mum and nanna)  O what 2 do ....... Sorry i just dont know who 2 talk 2 so i am speaking a loud, as i dont want 2 tell every body i guess what i am feeling, though yet I dont even know what im feeling ( O what a mess)  do i run away from paul for the best as 2 weeks of the un known is 2 me right now a life time ......... do i tell my precious babies .............. I really feel in a nightmare ..........yet im wide awake :(((  cee-jay Log in to post a reply",
