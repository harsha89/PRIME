I was very worried about my hair growth after taking taxotere, but I am almost 8 weeks after chemo and I can tell it's going to all come back now. I can still see my scalp and it's kinda sparse but thickening up. I am also taking biotin and stimulair. It seems to be helping because another lady I know that had same chemos as me but finished ten days earlier and I had a ton more growth than she did.  I also just lost my eyelashes on the bottom and am pretty irked about that, but what can you do?",

I get tearful rather easily and can barely talk about getting breast cancer without feeling very emotional/sad about it. I am halfway through radiation and I am so ready to give up. I know my emotions are playing a role.  (that and the painful red skin I have)",
