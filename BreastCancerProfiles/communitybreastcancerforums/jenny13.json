I will look into if she is a good candidate because of her BRCA status, I am not even sure what it is. Her docotor is great but he is not a fountain of information. (She didn't even understand that she had an extremly aggressive from of breast cancer until it had already come back.) Elaine I got the information from a study on PARP trials referenced on Dr Susan Love research foundation under triple negative topic. \"the study found that women who recieved the PARP inhibitor were 65% less likely to relapse and 60% less likely to die of their disease\" Now that stuck me as extremly high and I did not understand what the tiime frame was, so like I said I am taking everything I read with a grain of salt. Just trying to weigh our options and decide if it is right for my mom to make the move to a new oncologist who can offer this treatment.  Again I just have to thank all of you wonderful women for all the info and good advice I have received in the last week. I admire each and every one of you. I am trying to channel some of your courage to be strong for my mom. Jenny",

She is triple neg, She has a tumor in her chest area, mediumsteinum sp? Things are happening fast and she is confused and overwhlemed. Can anyone give me a quick education on PARP. I have read everything I can find over the last week but am still looking for anyone's experience. Her doctors (Swedish Cancer Institute-Seattle) do not participate in the studies but they are offering a study at UW-Fred Hutch which is in Seattle as well. We are overwhemed with decisions because she is supposed to start chemo(navalbene) Tommorrow with her Swedish doctor, do I encourage her to put that off and possibly switch care to UW to have a chance to recieve PARP. (her doctor said she would have to switch her care over- which is really scary to all of us but may be worth it) Sorry for all the questions, I know no one can answer this for us but I would like to hear anyone's experience with this drug. I read that PARP patients are 65% less likely to relapse, could this be true? seems to good to be true. Thank you, trying to help my mom wade through all the info and get through the shock of the first week. Jenny Log in to post a reply",

The study I was looking into is Parp and navalbene/ cisplatin it's phase one just looking at safe dosing soafter talking to the researcher we know she would be getting the Parp but I think she may be too worried about doing a Phase one study, may be better ones for her. I think we need to go get a second opinion because a lot of the confusion is from her oncologist never really explaining any of this too her. She just feels that treatment should be discussed, all the options. I am trying sometimes I feel like I am overwhelming her. Being my mom she worries more about what this is doing to us-her kids than herself. She just seems so healthy right now I want to try to help her stay that way as long as we can",
