      "Content": "BrandyR wrote: I went in for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound today. The doctor said it was a good thing I could feel the lump because it was impossible to see on the mam. She is concerned because it isn't a mass like she is used to seeing and it has no clear margins. The size could be anywhere from 5mm to 20mm. I'm 44. My biopsy is scheduled 1/5. I'm terrified and have no idea how I'm going to get through the next few weeks. Holidays are a non-event at my house so there's no distraction there. Any pointers would be very much appreciated.

I've had a couple of people say \"you should have pictures taken!\" But I think, why would I want a reminder of what I don't have any more? Because the surgery snuck up on us, I really haven't had the ability to go to support groups or talk to other women about this. I also wonder if I'm making it into a big deal (for me) because I feel like it should be. Part of me has started to hate them. It's so helpful to know that this community is here and that no one is alone. Thank you, ladies.",
