    "Content": "MizHolliday wrote: As many of you may already know, Dr. Jerri Nielsen-Fitzgerald, the courageous South Pole doctor who diagnosed and treated her own breast cancer is now fighting a brain tumor which has now rendered her virtually incapacitated.   Sources close to the family report that hospice has been called in to assist her in her home.    In an effort to raise cancer awareness, Dr. Nielsen has become the focus of the Canter Against Cancer benefit ride (the first of what organizers hope will be many) which will take place in Southampton Massachusetts, near her Southwick home on October 3rd., 2009. Here is the original press release: Two AHP Members Unite to Canter Against Cancer Effort Honors a Remarkable Woman, Doctor, and Horse Lover Southampton, Massachusetts-March 24, 2009-The intrinsic nobility of horses has a way of bringing out the best in people.  For AHP Affiliate members L.A. Pomeroy and Claudia Sarti of western Massachusetts, it has united them in an effort to raise funds for a good friend and horse lover, Jerri Nielsen, M.D.   Nielsen drew worldwide attention in 1998 after treating herself for breast cancer while stranded at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole research station, and is the best-selling author of Ice Bound:  A Doctor's Incredible Battle for Survival at the South Pole.  Her saga was adapted into a made-for-television movie, Ice Bound, starring Susan Sarandon. Last October, the 1977 Medical College of Ohio graduate was honored with an endowed scholarship in her name.  The Jerri Nielsen M.D. Scholarship Award will be given annually to graduating medical students who grew up in rural Ohio and plan to do their residency training in the state, preferably in emergency medicine. To honor their friend, and the scholarship in her name, Pomeroy and Sarti are coordinating the Canter Against Cancer Benefit Trail Ride and Pig Roast, Saturday, October 3, 2009, hosted by Charlie Kaniecki and Twin Orchard Farm in Southampton, Massachusetts, over 140 acres and 10 miles of trails during peak New England foliage season.  Proceeds from the event will go to the Jerri Nielsen M.D. Scholarship Award.  Rain date will be the following Saturday, October 10. \"Jeri has always loved horses, and has shared wonderful memories, from riding farm horses as a girl to watching dressage from the edge of an Swiss forest.  We wanted to do something to show how inspirational she has been to us.  Celebrating the joy of riding at such a perfect time of year, and raising support for a scholarship that means so much to her felt like the perfect choice,\" the AHP members say.  A breast cancer survivor, Nielsen has since learned that her cancer has returned and spread. There will be naming opportunities on Enchanted Forest, Sherwood Forest, Pioneer Valley Railroad, Hold Your Hat trails and Watch Your Ass Pass, a silent auction, and commemorative gear on sale starting April 1 at CafePress.com/CanterAgainstC.  Canter Against Cancer organizers thank SmartPak Equine for generously donating Kensington SmartPink TM grooming totes as special prizes.  SmartPak marketing assistant Karen Sinnott said, \"Twenty percent of our net profit on any SmartPink Plaid item is donated to breast cancer research, making it a great fit for this event.\" Canter Against Cancer Benefit Trail Ride reservations accepted now through September 25, with a suggested minimum donation of $20 per participant payable to the Western Massachusetts Public Health Association.  To learn more please email L.A.
