I am shedding like a Labrador so tonight the close buzz and shaved smooth. I can't stand cleaning up the hair. The first buzz was liberating so I suspect the second will feel the same. I am in control of when my hair is gone...BC has been driving for 6 months so it felt good to drive for a little bit. Life - I admire your willingness to show your new style. I did not buy a wig. I plan to use scarves and baseball hats! 2 down, 4 more to go :-)",

I thank each and every one of you for sharing here.  Your posts are like bright lights in a very dark hallway. I wish you all minimal SE as we take this journey together.",

The original mass was estimated at approx 1.9 cm.  The surgeon ordered an MRI.  After the MRI the radiologist did more mammograms and another ultrasound.  When reviewing the results the radiologist told me she found two more areas: a small mass and an area of linear calcifications. She felt strongly that the results indicated a multifocal cancer (all in the same quadrant) but they couldn't be sure without two more biopsies.  She said they mark each area they biopsy with a clip and then use a mammogram to measure the distance between each clip.  That measurement will give them the information they need to decide if I am a candidate for a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.  I am totally freaking out.   It will be weeks of further tests and waiting to get the answer.   At first it seemed clear to me - forget the additional biopsies and have an immediate mastectomy.    Now I am having second thoughts.
