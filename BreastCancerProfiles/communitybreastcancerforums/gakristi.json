Here is my timeline thus far.. pictures are 2 month / 2.5 month / 3 month / 4 month / 6 month (current):  It's coming in very curly, especially in back. You can see from the way it's sticking out on the sides too in the current (6 Mo) pic. Like most, I lost my eyelashes and eyebrows after my chemo was done. They are gradually coming back, but it's a slow process. My eyelashes actually came back.. then started falling out again. That was very discouraging.",

Predictably, I'm browsing this forum now that my chemo has come to an end and I'm ready to see HAIR! :0 My last treatment was 2/10 and I'm noticing scraggly, short hair coming in, but nothing consistent and my eyebrows and eyelashes aren't showing any improvement yet. Soon? I'm so ready to ditch the wig... it itches!",
