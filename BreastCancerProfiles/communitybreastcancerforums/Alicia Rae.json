No mammogram, ultrasound or MRI will pick it up but everyone can feel it!I don't know what to do. Also there is the problem that I am breast feeding so they are telling me its nothing, just from that. The breast surgeon doesnt seem worried but its because they can't see it and they can't even do an ultrasound guided biopsy because the ultrasound won't pick it up! They did a regular needle biopsy but I don't think they are getting the lump properly and they keep telling me its dense blah blah.. but its been 7 months and its getting bigger and its not going away. I want to know whats going on and no one can seem to give me answers. I feel like I am being pushed away. What else can I do to get some answers. Having had breast cancer before I feel like i'm being paraniod maybe?Â ",

However a few weeks ago I did a breast check for the first time I'm a while and found a small pea sized lump. Then starting this past Friday every time I lift my arm to put on my bra or my coat or really anything my nipple radiates pain! Sometimes it hurts for no reason. I'm wondering if this is something I should watch for a while or try to get to my dr before Christmas. I had a mammo in July and there was scarring but nothing else. I have had this pain come and go for a few months now but nothing was really done with it. I told my dr once and he suggested using canestan bc it might be an infection? But that's not working Dx 1/2010, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 4/22 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
