Ever since then I have had mysterious symptoms, 1) new and difficult to control asthma, 2) fatigue, 3) pain (stabbing and burning at biopsy sites), 4) heightened immune reactions resulting in several ER visits and lots of steroids 5) a dangerous allergic reaction to a titanium metal patch test (which was deemed inconclusive). A number of doctors have dismissed me and told me this is in my head. I would like to believe that but my immune system is now so out of control I cannot work, sleep, eat. In recent days I have found these links that I found helpful. 1) reactions to titanium dental implants:http://www.robertgammal.com/OtherPages/Implants.html 2) case study on titanium staples: http://primeinc.org/casestudies/pa_np/study /912/Adverse_Reactions_to_Titanium_Staples_in_a_Patient_Following_Cholecystectomy 3) adverse event with titanium breast markers:http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/detail.cfm?mdrfoi__id=752665 I am not a doctor - but I want to share my experience as fully and honestly as possible in case other people may be experiencing this rare reaction. Sincerely, Foreign Body",
