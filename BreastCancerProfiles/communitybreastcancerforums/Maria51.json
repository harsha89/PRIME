Have a few more wrinkles than the New Year's baby, but that's how I brought in 2013. :) The hair was coming out in handfuls so I was happy when a friend of mine came over and buzzed it. My scalp itches though. Any suggestions out there? I have been using aloe. Helps a little. Also, even with Neulasta injections, my white blood counts have been very low. Anybody else? Keep smiling ladies!",

I see a couple of you doing the same chemo as I - A, C & T. I am curious if the SE get worse as you get deeper into the treatments. Today will be my first day w/o the steroid or anti-nausea med. I've been feeling good the last 2 days. Next treatment is the 27th. Am curious as to what i might experience leading up to the 2nd treatment. Any input from you lovely, brave gals? Happy Sunday!

Thurs, Dec. 14th, I had my first chemo treatment of A and C. I will do dose dense, 4 -AC and then 4 Taxol. I was scared about the Adriamycin (the red devil) most of all. Surprisingly, I am feeling pretty good! I had some nausea the first day but with the help of prescribed meds, it was gone by morning. I had a Neulasta injection yesterday. Used some topical Lidocaine and Prilocaine cream...worked like a charm and the Claritin is a must from what I hear. We'll see how it goes moving forward. This is not for the feint of heart. We have a wonderful Cancer Center in Scottsdale that has so much support. When I went for my wig, they told me about something called, clinical laser hair therapy. It helps with a better quality hair follicle. They say patients with the treatment see their hair grow back after 5-6 months as opposed to 9-10. Here is the website for information; www.scottsdaleinstitute.net. The doctor's name is Shelly Freidman. You could see if this might be available in other parts of the US. I see there are many postings concerning hair loss, that's why I am mentioning it. I do plan to shave my head when it starts to fall out. My onc said that's when the reality sets in. Hair will grow back...least of my concerns at the moment. Staying positive, trying to drink 3 liters if liquid a day, a walk per day, connecting with supportive people and maintaining COURAGE are my goals. Hugs to all!",

I've had two Neupogen shots in addition to the Neulasta after 1st round. And just had another Neupogen shot after round 2 and the Neulasta. My onc seemed concerned. He made certain that I have Cipro on hand. However, I feel OK, just some fatigue.....and the itchy scalp. I was also given a sample of something called Mu Guard to prevent mouth sores. It is fairly new on the market. Must have just been approved by the FDA. It coats the oral cavity. The company sent me 5 complimentary bottles because my insurance would not cover the script. So far, so good. I've been using it for two weeks and it has helped. If anyone wants more info, I will be happy to supply. :)",
