    "Content": "Mom2HHS wrote: In February, I went to my OBGYN because my left breast had started leaking a yellowy sticky fluid.  He told me he wasn't worried at all and it was probably just fibrocystic breasts.  However, he did order a mammogram (to ease my mind) and tested my blood prolactin levels.  The prolactin levels were normal, but my mammogram was inconclusive due to dense breast tissue. So, I went in for an ultrasound.  To my surprise, the ultrasound was for my right breast (the one I wasn't having any trouble with).  The conclusion of the ultrasound was that I have a swollen lymph node in my right breast that I will have a follow up appointment for in October. The ultrasound didn't ease my mind so I decided to visit my plastic surgeon (I had breast augmentation and nipple reconstruction surgery following my 3rd round of breastfeeding my 3rd child).  My plastic surgeon didn't like the looks of it and referred me to a dermatologist.  I went to the dermatologist last week and I am scheduled for a biopsy on Monday to rule out Paget's disease.  So, here are my questions: 1.    Is it possible that the swollen lymph node in the right breast is a bad sign that it IS in fact cancer and has already spread to the other breast?  Does that even make sense?  2.  What type of biopsy will my dermatologist be doing?  Log in to post a reply",
