With my very high risk from diabetes to Family history so ended up hospitalized to rule out MI. None of the Doctors were familiar with the cardiac risks till I had to educate them. Later the cardiologist came back said he researched it and without his team in tow apologized. I get a echo tomorrow. Now back to just MRI vs Mammography every six months. I have LCIS XX almost two years ago. Took a long time to even try the medication knowing my long allergy list . I Keep getting encouraged to do a bilaterally mastectomy by everybody...oh just do it and then don\u2019t worry ..unforetunely I am Allergenic to dye and silicone etc so So this is a non option ...no thank you. Alone very alone",
