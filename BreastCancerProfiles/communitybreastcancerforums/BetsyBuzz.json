Finished up a month ago. One of the ladies on another thread suggested to some of us to share what worked for us with others as they go through treatment. So here goes: About day 17 my hair started falling out in clumps. My scalp started hurting. I buzzed it short but didn't shave it for another week or so. It was such a mess. My suggestion, shave it sooner...as soon as it starts coming out in clumps. It feels so much better not having the hair pulling on your follicles. I went without a wig the entire time and did just fine. But I know I was in the minority. Do what makes you feel the best. There is no right or wrong way to walk through this part of the treatment. I had terrible bone pain from neulasta shots and taxol. I learned when taking any pain meds along with chemo be sure to take a stool softener or two at the same time. If you are experience lots of bone pain talk with your onc., they will give you something to help. Also for the constipation, I used a morning cocktail the first week after chemo. 1/3 c OJ, 2/3 c prune juice heated (needs to be heated). I was able to drink it even when water started taste metallic (end of A/C beginning of Taxol). Lots of women on my thread said Claritan worked for pain. I did not have the same results. For neuropathy - I took glutamine and had very good results. Initially I was skeptical. Mostly cause I had difficulty getting it down. I finally figured out I could handle it with ginger ale. I took a tbsp in the am and one in the pm with about a cup of ginger ale, while on Taxol. I had a terrible time with finger pain and neuropathy and it really helped. I have no lingering neuropathy and I'm 4.5 months PFC. When food became an issue - which it did. I ate lots of fresh fruit, yogurt and egg salad. Cold food was easier on my mouth and stomach. Speaking of mouths - mouth sores...ask your onc for some magic mouth wash if it becomes a problem. I think its part lidocane, milanta and cherry flavor. Fatigue - Mine included heart palpitations. It was very scary to me. Actually I was totally freaked out by them. But it's part of the process. My RBC & WBC were very low. Listen to your body but get out of bed every day. I tried to walk each day..even though my dh laughed at me, he said I was moving at \"walker pace\", he was referring to elderly people walking with walkers not speed walking. Oh any one on the A/C T treatment plan...don't assume taxol is better. It's just different. It's better in some ways but worse in others. I know there is more...but that's all I can think of right now.  You can do this. These threads are a life line. It's a great place to whine, rant, encourage and learn. Plus it's truly amazing the friendships I've developed online. It's a wonderful support group. Good luck. Betsy",

I was more concerned with them accessing my port a cath than the TX. My shoulder and neck were still sore from the surgery. But thankfully it turned out to be nothing, way easier than them digging for a vein. Today day 4,  I seem to have a little more nausea and I'm a tad bit more tired than I thought I'd be. Maybe it was because day 3 wasn't as bad as I anticipated and I ended up taking a short walk and chatted with my neighbors. In Oregon, you go out side when the weather lifts even for a couple of hours. It's suppose to be a beautiful weekend I'm looking forward to enjoying my garden. Betsy ",

Maybe I was just too excited. Anyway it started out with the onc. dr. saying I should probably not have the last tx because my WBC was so low. He said if I was not on my last TX he would have canceled it. I think it was the look on my face. Of course he placed conditions on it, yes I have to go in for a neulasta shot today. YUCK but it's my last one - I can handle it. I also can't go in public or to work. I wish I would have known this weekend...I went to two BBQ's and there were lots of hugs and kisses. Then during my infusion I felt sick for the first time. Had very bad stomach cramps and nausea as my last bag was finishing up, they gave me more fluid and adiavan (sp?). I slept most of the afternoon and felt much better by the evening.  Oh well...I'm feeling great today so I can't complain. Titan - I tried the Claritin. My onc said he just read about it on his email this weekend. I was his first patient to ask about it. I'm hoping it works.   After 1:00 today I will be done with chemo.YIPPEE!!!

The also said tamox adds to the dryness.  I'm not sure if its a placebo effect or not but since I started using it my libido came back. We are still not back to pre-chemo levels, but yes..yes..yes (my Meg Ryan imitation LOL)...my dh and I have been happy campers. Changing the subject - is anyone still having twinges of bone pain? It's strange, lately it comes and goes, not to the degree of when we were going through chemo but it's there lurking in the background. It's probably left over from taxol. I'm just wondering if any of you are feeling it too.",

LOL Have you tried any compression garments for the truncal LE? MLD helps tremendously but so do the garments. The best is the Jovi...yes it squashes your boob with waffle iron imprints but it doesn't hurt. I wear it every night. On my bad days I wear a smaller pad that fits under the compression bra during the day. I use a Wear Ease compression bra. It looks like an exercise bra. Exercise is good, at least that's what my PT keeps telling me. She says it gets the lymph fluids flowing through the diagram correctly. Good luck. Sounds like you are approaching your job situation the best you can. We are all rooting for you on the job front. Titan -glad to hear you are ok. It's been miserable weather here lately. Cold, rainy and it has not let up but no tornado's TG. I'm ready for summer...or at least a little heat like something in the 60's or 70's would be nice. They are forecasting a good weekend but we are headed to eastern OR for a Board meeting and the good weather is not suppose to hit there until Sunday (the day we leave).

Yesterday after visiting my bs for the second time this year, she has begun treating for not only a breast infection (still going strong) but also for RIF -radiation induced fibrosis. Which according to most information I've read on the internet does not have a cure. Although there is one doctor that has questioned that there is no cure, he said there wasn't enough stats to conclude that as fact. I hope he is right. Now I'm not sure RIF is really a set dx yet, as it's very early, but my bs didn't hestitate for a second to put me on a new drug combo, Pentoxifylline er 400 plus Vit E. It's suppose to help heal the damaged cells heal correctly after radiation. BC certainly is the disease that keeps on giving. Geri, I hope you are right that there is a new treatment just around the corner. Count me in the weight gaining group. I was doing well until just recently when I gained seven pounds in 3 days. I'm keeping my fingers crossed it's water weight. Could I be that lucky? Probably not given my track record.... My hair is still curly, especially on top. Tomorrow I'm going in to get it shaped. I feel like and old lady that just had a bad perm.",

This year we invited the baby ya ya's...niece's for the first time. I think they enjoyed themselves. They stayed and talked with my mom while the oldies but goodies went for a walk. On Sunday before I hopped on the train home we headed to a glass recycling shop in north Seattle. Anyway...the traffic turned out to be horrible. After waiting for about 20 minute...trying to get around the Space Needle/Seattle Center we realized there was a parade going on. Then after driving about four blocks in I rememebered reading about the Gay Pride parade. So here we were in the thick of it.. I looked over and said wow...there are even old ladies coming to the event. Then after closer observation I realize...gesh...they weren't women. We howled. About a mile later my sister said OMG..look..I missed them but my other sister said...it was a bunch of guys in their undies. So I'm thinking no matter our foobs..no matter our weight..we are still better looking then some of the people we saw. I say we love who we are...no matter how damaged. On a side note I found the glass I wanted for my art project so it was a wonderful weekend. Sending hugs to everyone.. Geri...woo hoo...soon very soon you will cross the finish line! Betsy",

I've replaced my morning cup of coffee with this and it seems to work for me. Actually, when water tastes bad the warm prune juice tastes ok.  Hope this helps her. They also said...lots of fluids. I add a slice of lemon to my water and it seems to help with the metallic taste.",

Monday, a BSGI to rule out more \"cancer\". I really don't think that's the issue. It's inflammation that's the problem. I have a page and a half, albeit a small page, of questions to ask the onc tomorrow. I'm now on my 4th antibiotic and it's bringing back those wonderful stomach pains from chemo. Judy I know you can relate to this. My heartburn is beginning to kick in again. Oh joy...but only 8 days to go. I don't think I mentioned on this forum that my drug...trental..is not available in the US temporarily due to an issue at the manufacturing plant in China. So I ordered my drugs from Canada and hopefully they were shipped from India on Monday. Hopefully, I will get them before I run out on Sat. Judy too bad I didn't know you were heading to the UK...you could have picked up some for me.    Dawn- sorry to hear that the damage to your house was so major. Sounds all consuming. Lena- I tried the hot tub this past weekend, just from the waist down, and I still flared up. So no hot tubing until I lick this infection, or whatever it is.",

You deserve happiness and joy in your life. Today I went to a new shop to look for a second sleeve...One sleeve is not enough. as I need to wear it all day seven days a week. Thankfully my dh came with me and I let him pick out which one he liked. He picked \"Versace\"...yeah I snagged a man with very good taste. Anyway, I ordered another sleeve and gauntlet. My arm is not much better as I pushed it too hard last weekend moving a large rug.

So basically I had to start over with therapy. I'm still seeing my PT and acupuncturist once weekly. I'm still hopeful this is a short term thing...I just need to stop trying to do too much. My only problem is my dh is starting to think he can't touch me...his little china doll...and I'm not even Asian. He thinks no matter what he does he is hurting me.

Thanks for letting blow off steam in my past few posts. I was just so frustrated. Every time I start moving forward something else happens. But hopefully that's all behind me know. Slow and steady progress is what I'm after. I decided to get serious about my half hearted diet. I've been reading The 4-Hour Body. Although, it's a little out there and pretty geeky it's made me begin to focus on what it is going to take. What is going on in my body. Today, I started my refocusing. I asked my dh to take pictures of me in a two piece bathing suit, front, side and back shots. OMG! Talk about incentive...I took one look at those pictures and decided enough is enough. I printed them and pasted them in my journal. I documented my measurements and weight. When I get hungry between meals I will look at the pictures and ask myself do I really want to continue to look like THAT? Based on the book, I think I'm about at a 30-35% fat ratio...which is totally unacceptable. Helen, glad to hear you are feeling a little better. Amy- yes Oregonians are a little wacky (or should I say quacky)! I'm glad you enjoyed your trip.

Just wanted to give you an update..thanks for all the well wishes. My mum...dodged another bullet this time.

Helen - have you read anything about lymphedema? It usually affects the arm they do the snb on. I've heard it's not something that you should ignore....not that you would. I hope it turns out to be nothing. I haven't told the Dr. yet about my decision to reject the drug option for osteopenia. I've decided calcium, Vit D and weight training for a year is what I'm going to try to get these weak bones back in shape. If that doesn't work...then maybe...I will move on to drugs.  My \"real fuzz\" as my dh puts it, is now turning to \"real hair\". Little wild and crazy ones... but some have color!!!! Chelev - is that make over coming up? I bet you are excited. Judy - My heartburn is gone for the most part. I can always tell by my mouth if something is going to cause me problems. It still gets rubbed raw with some food. But for the most part, I'm back to eating everything is sight. Not good for the weight...but great to be moving beyond chemo. I hope you are feeling better each day. Has anyone else felt the numbness of taxol coming and going with their hands, feet or legs? Everyone once in a while everything gets numb and tingly...it's probably just latent se's. Hugs to all. Betsy",

One minute it looks dark (I think it's a shadow effect) the next it looks all gray (yikes..but I'll deal with it). Dawn - you radiate such positive energy! Thank you for your encouragement. Now I better go \"air\" my flaming (swollen and very irritated) boob by truly going topless. Quite the picture huh?  Tweetie Bird hair and the girls hanging free.

When my gyn said \"only a little more, I just want to be thorough\" I responded...\"it's fine with me do it now because you are not going to have a second chance.\" I was too afraid to LOL. AIA glad that's over. She said I would probably get results by Friday. If it's a polyp, I will be scheduled for a D&C. If its more, most likely a hysterectomy. I feel exhausted. I took a lorazepam before the appointment...I just didn't want to be too stressed. Now I can hardly keep my eyes open. I will sleep well tonight. I'll keep you all posted.",

Heartburn again, not as intense, and the anti nausea pills are helping so another thing to be thankful for.  Lena...I hope things are going ok for you.

It is why this type of hysterectomy takes longer to heal from. I think it's all that's holding me together where my cervix was removed.

I was very inflamed through the last two weeks of rads an my tissue opened slightly then. The infection could have started then but he was just guessing. He did say this was NOT the beginnings of a recurrence. He said don't let my mind even go there. Ya...one green boob would go with my red one...making a very festive pair. Truly it's really not bad...rads pain was way worse. I'm only half as inflated as I was during rads. I was just depressed a little at the minor set back...so I needed to  vent. I'm sure the antibiotics will kick this minor infections butt...at least I'm hoping so. ljh58 - I can totally relate to your racing heart rate. My last bp at the onc's office was 202/106. I almost fell off the chair. I doubled my bp meds before chemo started, as I was running high after the dx. But even double the dose those bp levels are stroke levels. I think it was because they had just dug for a vein to take blood and that always stresses me out. TG - since then my bp has been much lower. Dawn...you are right I'm holding out for Titan before I post an updated pic. I spiked my hair today with Urban gel...I think it's good ole butch wax. When I got home from work my dh said...what happened? Don't think he cared for it much. Oh well, most of the ladies at work liked it...it's different, but not sure I liked it either. Alaina- I also have amazing cowlicks that why I tried the wax...thought they might blend in better. Although, I think I need a hair dresser as it just looked like my entire head was many, many cowlicks mushed together. I've never been one to mess with my hair much...so this is all new to me.",

Sorry to hear your throat is so sore. I went to a nutritionist yesterday, I loved her. She as put me on a probiotic (Ultimate Flora Critical Colon BifidoMax) for my stomach/bowel issues. She said most likely after chemo my stomach never really got back to a normal flora environment. Also, she said as I've long explained to the medical doctors, I do eat a very high fiber healthy diet. She said she wished all her patients were as knowledgeable about what they were eating. She encouraged me to add more yogurt, increase my calcium from foods and keep up my fluid intake.  I am still going to the Gastro Endo. appt. in January. I have a second appt. with her this month to cover foods with estrogen, as I may not continue on my hormone therapy, and discuss the progress I've made with the probiotics and of all things Xylitol or erythritol (sugar substitute) I need to add it to my diet. I normally only cook with brown sugar and don't have much sugar in my diet. Apparently the \"ols\" sugar substitutes act like a laxative in a lot of people. I wish I would have insisted on this consult right after chemo. I'm so glad I found her. Judy...I think based on your stomach issues you might want to seek out a nutritionist too. I explained the heartburn and constipation associated with chemo. Next week my medical onc appt., the following week first exam after surgery with my gyn onc, nutritionist appt. & dental appt. I plan to try to go back to work part time starting next week. I'm hoping to only work part time for the first few weeks. Given all my doctor appts. it's turning out that I don't have much of a choice in the matter. I'm a little surprised how good I feel some days and tired the next. Unless Lena has a turn for the better, I don't expect her back to our board. She knows we support her and are here for her if she needs to vent (assuming she has the energy). She has no choice but to focus on herself right now. She would slap us down in a heartbeat if we got too mushy on her. It makes me smile just to think of what she might say. Amy...I haven't forgotten, I still need to email you our Olympic itinerary.  ",

Location does not matter much to me, other than like Amy says it needs to be a place easy to get too. Titan...if you need a roomie...count on me, I'll bring ear plugs just in case you're lying about snoring. LOL   My bloated surgery stomach is coming back down to my new normal humongous size (at least for me). My weight is awful but I've decided not to worry about it, I'd rather feel good than worry too much about weight.  I've begun my gym workouts again, so I am feeling better these days. I look ghastly in my workout clothes. Vanity is a great incentive, I refuse to get new fat lady gym clothes. Last week, I went to the gym 5 times, so it seems to be working. I get my genetic results Feb 9th., 20th my mammogram, 27th another meeting with the gastro dr. Oh joy, a month full of appointments. February is the month for most of us to have annual appointments. It's amazing that three years have past, sometimes it feels like it was ages ago and other times it feels like it was just yesterday. Hugs to all. Betsy ",

So I'd say in three weeks I might have the results. It was ok with me. I really don't want to know. It will be a mixed blessing no matter what happens.

She as a real cute accent. They were a half day ahead of us on a road trip. I'm hoping they got good weather. Where we stayed in Hansville, it was beautiful. Sunny with a cool breeze off the water. What a wonderful way to kick off my sabbatical. We went to the lavender gardens in Sequim, WA. Also went to a Chihuly glass exhibit in downtown Seattle. Plus I got plenty of time with my family. I am very saddened with my younger sister, she has definitely declined cognitively since I last saw her. It is so sad to see the vacant look in her eyes when she stops tracking the conversation or doesn't know what you are saying. If you say could you please chop the carrots, she doesn't know what you are asking. If you show her, she is fine. So, so, sad! Well I need to head outside to water, we are suppose to finally get some warm weather here. Scheduled my one any only appt. for next Thursday. A blood draw for my Cleveland Clinic genetic study, I think it's called P10 (Molecular Mechanisms in Cancer Predisposition).  Have a great weekend. Betsy",

I'm glad you felt pampered on your shopping trip...plus it sounds like you got a little bling bling for the wedding. Good for you!   I saw a women tonight when walking with a shaved head.

It was about almonds and how quickly they help with heartburn. I thought you might want to give it a try the next time you have a bout.    Geri - Love your posts.

For me it was just a GYN visit, transvag, very painful biopsy, referral to GYN Onc., surgery. I have my first annual appointment next Monday. Can't believe it's almost been a year since my surgery. The odds are really against EC for Amy, only a .02% chance and I am already one in the stats on this board. So I'm feeling really good for her. Not that she has to go through this scare but that the odds are really good for her. I too tried to look up Lena. I went back through her posts to see if I could find some detail that would lead me to her. But no such luck. I think its interesting that there were a number of us that tried to become Sherlock Holmes and find Lena. I am ubber sad today. My neighbor that lives next door wasn't feeling well before I left. She had a very bad cough that had been going on for months. She had some tests the day before I left. We came home yesterday to news of stage IV pancreatic cancer, mets to the lungs, spine and nodes.

My onc and I discussed not going on the aromatase inhibitors once I officially become post-menopausal. My choice is to stick with tamoxifen and he seemed ok with that decision. But he said we will discuss it more during my next visit. He said when chemo induces memopause they wait a full year to classify you as \"post-menopausal\". Judy..I drank four large glasses of water prior to my blood draw. Took my bp meds early yesterday and will take the balance tonight as I take a diuretic. I ran my arm under hot water until I couldn't stand it and the tech said...no good let's look at your hand. So she said warm it up, I went back to the sink. She got the smallest needle and tube. When she got the vein she said she has done IV's on babies with bigger veins then mine. I thought...go figure. But she got it on the first try and it didn't hurt.

It's going to start in two weeks so we have to pack up our kitchen and family room soon. Lots of work to do. Tomorrow I'm heading north to Seattle via Amtrak for a Sister \"girls\" weekend. I have three sisters and two sister in-laws, one female cousin, one gay male cousin and some nieces plus my MOM and they are all coming together to celebrate life. We are going to have a blast. Lots of drinking and eating. I so look forward to it. Everyone have a great weekend. Helen, I hope your son's wedding goes smoothly. Betsy",

The cellulitus is very serious. She has been on IV antibiotics for the past two days. Our kitchen now has dry wall up so the house feels better. It was weird not having a ceiling for several weeks. I think the texture goes up next week. Then primer...then cabinets. We went over to my in-laws to cook tonight. I left half the food there thinking my MIL won't be up to cooking. My FIL can work the microwave but that's about it. Weight loss with Wellbutrin...humm...sounds interesting. Helen and Lena keep us posted. Even if you don't lose weight hopefully you will feel better. When I was on anti-depressants they really helped. I won't hesitate to start them up again if I start struggling. Maybe I'm still numb but I don't seem to be feeling down about much of anything lately. I'm just thankful my energy is finally back. Maybe I'm in denial and it's going to hit me smack dab in the face soon. Right now I'm just enjoying the life I have. Judy...my short term and long term memory still comes and goes. I think the more stressed I get the worse it is. I'm trying to manage my stress better but some days it's just plain hard! Have fun on your trip. Amy...I can't wait until tomorrow. Your surprise sounds fun! Titan - don't change your freakin ways...freakin is better than the other F  word.",

Sorry it sounded sort of stressful but it did sound interesting. First Chelev...now you. Wow we have some celebs on this thread. Alaina - I tried looking at your pics but just ended up in the facebook login. I logged in but had no idea how to follow the link. Can you or anyone else help me? Ya...I'm a Luddite. Judy - have a great trip. Re: my bucket list...I've never really thought about it before. I wanted to climb Mt. Hood when I turned 50 but didn't do it. Now I just don't think I am physically able to do it. Hell...I have trouble walking around the freakin block. I've been having weird leg cramps lately. About a week ago I had a terrible time at night. First in one leg then the other. Now it seems to have settled in a funny shot on the right side of my right leg. Last night it kept me up most of the night. It is very frustrating. Anyone else having cramps? Should I be worried about a blood clot? Lena...what did it feel like when your's was dx? I'm probably just getting worked up over nothing. It's probably just age. Oh yeah...I was thinking about the bucket list. Well I do want to go to the Galapagos Islands one day and Arches National Park. I also want to learn to hula hoop again. I've lost my touch. That's all I can think of right now. Alaina I'm glad you had so much fun. Hope you all have a great week. Betsy",

As I recall last year they didn't tell me anything. I'm not sure I'm willing to go on any of the \"bone meds\" as bone pain is a SE. I was dx with ostopenia last year. Hopefully all that calcium I've been gagging down will have helped. My surgeon onc (my wonderful dr) has taken a new position as the director of the cancer institute...so now I have to figure out a plan b. I'm bummed. She said she would continue caring for her current patients but with a 1/2 schedule it's going to be almost impossible to get in. I suspect that means she won't be adding any new patients. I left a msg last week for her assistant to call me, and I still haven't heard. I need to know whether to continue my trental & Vit E experimental meds or not. Of course...my dang boob started flaring up again. I've been doing my LD and wearing my waffle compressor so I can't figure out what's wrong. Maybe it's because I'm not excerising enough.  We are about at the half way point in our kitchen remodel. I miss my kitchen sink the most but it's been fairly easy. Good thing it's been nice weather and we have a nice backyard. They are painting today. In just over a week our countertops go in. So it's coming right a long. If any of you are in the neighborhood..you are all invited to our \"break in the Kitchen party\". It will be in October. Well the fumes are getting to me. Time to head over to the in-laws. Wish me strength...I'm not looking forward to staying there. I asked my dh, would he be willing to pitch a tent in the backyard which sounds like way more fun to me... He said no. Damn....",

My niece baked cupcakes and there was a county western band playing a concert at my mom's retirement center. 5 of the 6 siblings were there with spouses and family. We were all having a wonderful time until my mom fell in the bathroom. I think she was in a hurry..not wanting to miss all the attention. She hit her nose and glasses. All the nurses, including my two sisters, thought she should go to emergency. So my sisters packed her up and spent the remainder of the evening in the ER. Long story short she was fine, no broken nose just bruised. I told her today, she sure knows how to end a party with a bang!! Lena- As I was reading through the past weeks posts, I couldn't help but smile. I am so happy for you and Pack Rat. I think by this time next week, I will have a stove-top and sink. Tomorrow the counter tops go in. The smell from the paint is still pretty strong...but not enough to get high on. :) After that we get kicked out again when they refinish the floors. Then I will get my house back and will have a new and hopefully wonderful kitchen. Amy- thanks for giving us an update on Alaina. I hope her weekend went smoothly. Geri- I agree with Lena. At my next visit with my onc I am going to be officially classified as technically \"menopausal\". I have drawn the line, no aromatase inhibitors for me. I plan to stick with tamoxifen even though it is slightly less effective but my body seems to tolerate it fairly well. I have minor bone pain with it but nothing like neulasta & chemo. I have PT scheduled for Tuesday to tame my swollen boob. Gotta go now, I have to go for my nightly walk. I need to breathe deep to get that lymph fluid flowing correctly. Truly it does help. How is everyone doing on the exercise and diet front? I haven't been doing well at all. Betsy",

You are just getting use to your new digs...give yourself some, as Titan would say, freaking time! Good docs, loving Pack Rat, bigger place...just enjoy!   Tulipbebe- I have hair envy. My bangs are just now getting long enough for me to like. Although, they get curly and shrink the moment they dry. My hair is more wavy these days than curly..so I see a slight improvement but certainly nothing to brag about. Judy- I thought I heard about the Brazilian straightening had some really bad chemicals in it. So it sort of scares me. Maybe it was just one of the products used. Geri- So happy for you re: your liver function. Whewww...major relief for you. I'm doing ok. Started acupuncture, it gave me instant relief. It was the first time in 12 months that it didn't notice or feel my bc breast, 24 hours of relief!  After 24 hours the pain/ache returned. Even so I'm very encouraged. I am seeing a MD from China, he doesn't have his MD in the States so he doesn't call himself a doctor but he is very good. He thinks the damage is in my nerves not actually lymphedema. Although, he says I have lymphedema in my upper arm. Work is crazy busy. One of my staff is in the hospital with a mass in her stomach. She was dx with colon cancer two months before I was dx with breast cancer. She is not healthy and has had a very rough time over the past two years. It freaked me out she came to work one day and she looked very much like my late hubby when his bowel ruptured. We forced her to call her doctor. Before she left on Friday I told her she should call 911 if she had any problems over the weekend, as her condition may be life threatening. She listened because on Sunday she ended up in the hosptial.  It has been an emotional week for me, a hellacious week for her. At least she is in the hospital where they are watching her closely. I'm looking forward to the next two weekends...I get two three day weekends in a row. I need them. Betsy",

Hopefully, they will kick some as# in January and you win your pool! Lena- hey..I think I moved my silverware at least four times, cups and glasses twice until I found the \"right\" spot in my new kitchen. It took a couple of months before I settled in. At least your post has made me feel better, I thought I was just being a little neurotic. BTW- I don't even feel the needles. Only once did I even feel the poke. It's almost pain free and I am becoming a believer. My achy breast has begun to improve. I have had better results from this than the MLE (manual lymph drainage). The MLE works..but doesn't take the pain away. Since I started the acupuncture I have even begun to not wear compression garments at night and wow...what an improvement in the sex life. Nothing shouts...I'm not in the mood more than a waffle pad stuck on your breast. My poor dh...has been wonderful through this ordeal. I feel like I am finally beginning to turn a corner. My friend is still in  ICU. She had surgery on Tuesday. No colon cancer TG, her bowel was twisted and she had four pockets of infection drained and biopsied. They think the infections are related to diabetes. She is still very sick. We were dx'd about the same time, her with colon cancer me with bc. I have faired much better and I'm thankful. Hope you all have a very Merry Christmas. I will check in next week. Take care. Betsy",

Only problem is my natural metabolism has slowed to a slugs pace and even though I'm working out, reduced my calories I'm still not losing weight. Well I shouldn't say that, I got on the scale yesterday and was down 4 lbs. Woo Hoo! But it's a REALLY SLOW...process. I use to be able to lose 5 lbs just like that. No longer. Plus this muffin belly is just awful but I will continue to work on it. Glad to hear your diet is going so well, it's encouraging news. Judy- I wear a compression bra daily, also wear a pad at night that makes my chest look like a waffle iron attacked it. I tried a compression sleeve this weekend because my arm is now causing me problems but my hand swelled up so I took it off. I'm still going for acupuncture and PT. My next PT appointment isn't until the 25th. I hope things don't get worse before then. My PT is a LE specialist so I will defer to her as to how to better manage it. My doctor told me today I need to switch and become left handed. My right arm can't take any kind of rubbing, scrubbing, dishwashing or gardening. He said I have 40 years to make the switch from age 54, 64, 74, 84, 94.....Easy for him to say. My dh said maybe we need to get a house cleaner...I responded YES. At work I'm going to try a left handed mouse. I know I can't do a left handed ten key but will try to switch on most other fronts. Will this new normal ever become normal?",

I had envisioned that by now life would be relatively back to normal. Hasn't happened yet for me. I threw a total tantrum at my work last week, I was just fed up and almost walked out. My dept. had two key staff gone and all their work ended up on me plus managing a new hire it was just crazy. I think my boss got the picture. I actually threw my telephone across my desk...totally not a Betsy thing to do. But it felt good. I told him the all the doors in the building were too heavy and hurt my arm every time I walked into the building and going from office to office. They are these big extra large doors. I can't open the computer room or the safe. I can't lift the files anymore. They are trying to work with my ever demanding changes such as buying me a left handed keyboard and a left handed mouse.  I've switch to left handed adding machine, I am sooooo uber slow. So I guess I should be glad that they are willing to work with me, I guess I'm more frustrated at my body than anything else. It sucks. But on a positive note. My arm is slightly better, I still have a pain in my elbow any time I use it but it is better. Plus, I've lost 7.5 lbs since the beginning of the year and 4.5 lbs since I've been on my diet (2 weeks) AND we are flying to Maui on Feb. 26th. I can hardly wait. Got to go get dressed.

I bet she is busy being the mother of the bride. Showers, etc. At least I hope that's what you are up to. Lena I planted my garden last week between rain showers. I had to put cloches on my tomatoes otherwise it will be a summer of green tomatoes for me. Of course, I love fried green tomatoes (the movie too) so if the cloches don't work I will still be happy. I lost all my artichoke plants this year, so I need to replace them but the soil is too wet. I love how gnarly artichoke plants look plus they are really good to eat.  One year I stripped all the leaves off and let the artichoke bloom, it was like a living sculpture. I love gardening, it's very therapeutic to me, even with my gimpy arm. It's getting late so I need to sign off. Hugs and happy hump  day to all. Betsy",

It's because I didn't wear my sleeve when working out and then we (dh & I) went out to dinner after working out. Eating out is just too salty for me...bummer but true. I can get away with one trigger event but not two, I'm learning but a little slow on the uptake. So I'm back to wearing the sleeve and MLD but all in all, I can't complain. Life is good. Sending hugs to all! Betsy",

Last week was the first 90 degree day we've had all summer (of course right on queue my arm started swelling but I'm managing it better these days). No complaints here. Sounds like you all need to batten down the hatches. I remember the last big quake we had. I was living in a different house, it was early in the morning, back then I had a waterbed. I was just waking up and the water started rocking back and forth. It was wonderful, I felt like I was surfing in the ocean. It sort of felt like a ride, I couldn't help but enjoy it until the large tree next to the foundation cracked and I thought HS!. That's when I started getting scared. My preparation kit for any emergency: Plenty of water, food, wine and toilet paper.   Wishing you all a safe weekend and I hope the hurricane does not affect you too much. Betsy   ",

Alleluia!. Rethinking this entire ordeal, I'm getting a little angry about it. First of all, I was vomiting on my hospital bed fully clothed and they sent me home. What the F? Why would any nurse, even after I signed the discharge papers allow someone to leave when they are vomiting. Plus, that was just the beginning. My poor dh had to hear me vomit my entire evening meal on our drive home.  That began my vicious cycle of trying to eat, I kept food down for about 3-6 hours, more vomiting.  I kept that up for 4 days when my sister finally arrive and said, this is not right, who knows what is going on inside her. Thankfully, it was just my bowels stopped moving. Hell they and everything else are/were in shock. I couldn't leave the hospital because my bladder also stopped. I think it's all the anesthesia and bleeding. Isn't it the health care provider that should be watching out for that type of thing? I bet I'm not the only one with a system that shuts down after major trauma? The bruising is even worst today, it's now half way down my thigh and up to my breast on both sides. My pelvic area is the worst, I am so freakin swollen it hurts to sit. On the brighter side, I finally got into my fat lady pants today. I could only wear my dh's lounging pj's up until today due to swelling. At least, that feels like an improvement. Hell'va way to lose weight.  When I can sit longer I will tell you about my IV Therapy team in ER. Lena- I hope you are doing ok. Well off for my mandatory 15 min. walk. Sending hugs to all. Betsy",

Well, since I needed fluids they had to access my veins. When the nurse looked at my bruised hand (5 attempts) and wrist (1) she called for IV therapy. When the IV nurse came, she looked at me real close and was eyeing my wrist again. I said, you need to use lidocaine. She said no. I said in a low, serious voice \"then you better be damn good, cause you only get one try\". I think I scared the begebezes out of her, after she left my dh and sister said I channelled John Wayne and cracked up laughing. She called for the small vein specialist. When she came, she happened to be a little chatter box. I was in no mood to talk, I had a splitting headache, my stomach hurt and I was nauseated. Any woo..she asks me so what side was your breast cancer on? I said my right side, she says \"WOW...three rightees in the room.\"  We were all in various stages, the first IV nurse just had her trans flap, the specialist had only part of her breast repair work done. She said after her mastectomy, she was going home to Korea to have further work done. She said they will keep her in the hospital for up to a week vs sending her home with drains in like the US does. My sister, who had her phone with her said she wanted to take our picture. Now remember, I feel like crap...eventually I said ok. She plans to send it to me and I will forward it on to the hospital. So instead of three amigos...we were the three rightees. Long story short, the specialist accessed my wrist without lidocaine and said if I had any further need for IV they needed to give me a pic-line. TG I just needed the one bag of fluid. Count-5 IV attempts in my hand, 2 in my wrist and three draws from my arm for one dang surgery. No wonder I'm traumatized when they say \"lab work\".",

Can you tell I work in accounting? I wanted a verification the funds were used for my designated purpose.  I think this was the first time anyone had ever done this and both gentlemen were obviously moved. I said I was just paying it forward. I remembered Lena stressing over her bills...not something a person with cancer needs and the opportunity presented itself. Lena this was in your honor!

I was suppose to go to Seattle this weekend to visit my sister. My dh is having a guys poker party right now so I was trying to get out of his way. Anyway, all Amtrak trains were cancelled. Seattle got lots more snow than we did, it's just finally melting there today. Wind and more rain predicted so I decided to stay home. I went to see Hugo tonight. I realized it was kinda nice to be on my own tonight. I also realized I've sort of lost touch with some of my girl friends. So tonight I decided I need to nurture my friends more, I think that might be my New Years Resolution. BTW...I loved Hugo! Had my Lynch Syndrome testing done on Thursday. I really, really don't want to know mostly because there are all sorts of cancers associated with it. Colon being the most likely. I learned something, when they remove any tissue, tumors, etc from your body they keep it for 25 FREAKING YEARS! The counselor told me this because I could have choosen to have a test on my tumor. But she said with my family history if it came up negative she would not believe it and recommend the genetic test anyway. She and the \"2nd opinion\" doctor both said I had a very bad family history. I'm sure my family will be happy to hear that joyous news. I finally decided knowledge is better than putting my head in the sand. Needless to say, I was very depressed that night. I told my dh it was a hell'va day to quit drinking. We be both decided to have a glass of wine....ah...maybe more than just one glass. But who's counting?   I will get my results in three weeks, waiting again really sucks. But like Amy said, others have it so much worse. And yes...I miss and think of Lena often too. So do we want to try to get together sometime in the fall? Titan I know we've tried this B4 but maybe this year it will work.  I have all of August and early Sept. off and I've never been to New York? Do you want to meet there? Maybe we could do something to honor Lena? Just throwing out the idea. Judy...we could try to Sykpe you into to the group unless you could join us too...which would be totally awesome. Thoughts?

At least I enjoyed myself... LOL. I used a glycerine soap with no fragrance through rads and it worked very well. I had skin break down in under my arm (do to rubbing) but no problems with the boost area and the rest of the RADS area. I had a lot of swelling but it's gone down a bunch and I'm almost two weeks PFR. It feels so much better today than two weeks ago.  Judy - I saw your post on the hair, hair, hair thread about facial hair. I shaved mine. I couldn't stand it. The pull off tape removal technique hurt like......well you can catch my drift. Titan - Have a wonderful trip! I hope your boob doesn't blaze too much next week so you really enjoy your get-a-way.    This next weeks starts the first full week of what I believe is the beginning of my healing process. No more assaults on my body. I will pass the two week mark from Rads - they say Rads burns up to two weeks out. I feel thankful my breast is back to it's pre-Rad size...although I suspect it's going to shrink some more. My dh & I decided we are re-joining this gym we use to go to up until a year ago. I feel good, thankful, hopeful and very happy to be done.  Lena- Are you still doing ok on the tamoxifen? I haven't really had any se's and I worried there for a while thinking it might trigger my migraines again, based on your post. TG it didn't. I hope you are doing ok. On the hair front...I have color...it's mostly gray, a dark gray. I've gotten a number of compliments on how good it looks short. Even my dh likes it. I think it still looks medically induced but give it another inch, it might look ok. Funny thing is, it's a mix of guys and women saying they like it...they say it looks edgy. Well a little too edgy for my liking...but who knows maybe I will keep it short. It sure is easy. Helen..how's that Nordic walking going? I hope everyone is feeling good. Betsy ",

I had a melt down this weekend. I told my pt on Friday, after discussing all my issues, edema, tendonitis, weight gain and generally just feeling freakin tired of it all, including the weekly appointments, I was just about finished with it. Then she suggested I go to a naturopath and get acupuncture on my leg. Plus, I needed to lose weight. Just what I need more appointments and the comment about my weight  pushed me over the edge. I know she was talking clinically, as less weight lymph fluid flows better but  I said, I know I need to lose weight, I've started weight watchers, workout and eat right. She thinks my edema is systemic. I indicated I thought most of my edema is cause by the tamoxifin I'm taking. She said why don't you switch to AI's? I said because it's my body and I don't have luck on most meds. I think she realized she hit a button with me, and said wisely, let's table this conversation. I told her I was not going to the trainer she recommended as I needed my onc's waiver and hers and I forgot the paperwork. I said, it's a freakin 4 page waiver. I'm not under chemo, I just wanted guidance so I don't injure my arm or leg further on the machines at the gym. She said she would help me next week with a circuit I can follow. I think I surprised her with my anger. I guess I've hit a wall. I'm sick of my leg and arm aching constantly. I am shocked at what I see in the mirror.  Helen, one thing she said was I should eliminate wheat. Next she said, I need to eliminate alcohol completely. I told her I went to a dietitian and she said don't eliminate things in my diet? The mixed messages are driving me crazy. So I plan to just stay on weight watchers and eliminate alcohol for a while to see if it helps.  I will try wheat next. I also plan to check out the book you have read. I think I'm still ranting...my poor dh deserves a medal. It's not been an easy weekend. On top of everything, one dr. appt. today, I woke up with vertigo this a.m. I took a sick day. I need a mental health day as much as a day to nuture my body.",

Boy!!! did that feel great. My chest and arm are still swollen but things are slowing improving on that front too. My dh & I have been trying to walk nightly. Plus we walked a lot over the weekend. I've even come to terms with no alcohol. I have minimized diary products since they cause constipation. I'm still working on healing the anal fissure that happened during chemo.  Helen-I'd love you to PM whatever recipes you'd like to share. Congrats on the weight loss. Your yoga class sounds good.   Amy, a women I work with gave me a coupon for 3 trainer sessions. I think we take her up on the gift. We are still planning our trip this fall although I have until July to back out. We will probably wait until then to make our final decision. My problem is I know my leg will swell flying for 9-13 hours. So how do I cope with it. I'm going to ask my GP if they will give me one dose of lasiks (sp?), so I can quickly get rid of the extra fluid. Odds are they won't do it, but I figured I'd ask. I will only use it if I have to...because frankly I don't want to spend all my first day or so in the WC. Thank you all for your support it means a lot to me. I don't feel as angry these days, mostly because I'm feeling better. Plus we finally got some beautiful weather. My garden is gorgeous right now. I love this time of year.

I was thinking of trying to track more down...but since I'm on antibiotics again, I don't think I will waste my energy. I know of only one place that has a whopping six pills. Is anyone else having problems with them drawing blood? I think all my veins have collasped with chemo or because of the drugs I'm on. They couldn't find anything in my arm yesterday so they hit my hand twice. They've probably screwed me up for my test on Monday. I will just have to wait and see. My hand is all bruised, so I know they won't want to poke it again. Helen - I'm sorry to hear about your DIL's mother. Life is not fair. Sorry to hear you all are having such a hard winter. It's been super mild and warm here. Although, today it was very rainy. The pictures on the news are amazing. I'm loving watching the Olympics too. Have a great weekend!",

I guess we are now expecting a Artic cold blast next week. So all the early blooming flowers and plants are going to get a major shock next week. They are predicting 2-5 inches of snow on Tuesday. But here, we view weather forecasters as lier's...they are never right, so we'll see. But as a precaution, I am going to winterize my tender plants tomorrow. Plus all my newbies...new purchases from nerd night, are going into my garage. So just a warning... a winter storm is moving east starting this week. So you mid and east coasters, plan on more winter weather next weekend depending on how it tracks.",

While going through rads it was pretty easy as Lesley indicated. My hardest parts were the boosts. By the time that rolled around my tissue began turning black, I couldn't feel it, it just looked bad. It sort of scabbed up and when the scabs fell off so did the surgery scars. Now when new doctors look at me they always ask if my port scar is where I had surgery. The rads burnt my scars right off my body. Sorry to hear you are facing another round of treatments. Cancer SUCKS. At my onc appt. today I asked about my potassium blood work. I guess there was a mix up and my BC onc ordered a CBC instead of a potassium panel. So I had to repeat the test. Aarggh.

As I celebrated this week, I thought of Lena. I'm thankful that even though life isn't perfect, I'm alive and I'm happy you my sister's are too! You helped me through some very tough times and I am thankful for all of you. I celebrated my year 4 anniversary having the worst mammogram ever this past week. The tech was new and needs a lot more practice. Heavy sigh... Anywoo...my anniversary was on the 13th, it's easy to remember because I had surgery on Friday the 13th. I've feeling good these days. My arm LE has pretty much resolved itself. TG Still working on my leg LE from my hysto. -Amy I'm sorry you have had such a tough time. I love not worrying about bleeding but no ovaries has caused terrible vaginal dryness. My onc has ok'd a topical estrogen since my labia tissue was breaking down. Other than that SE and the leg edema, I love not worrying about cancer lurking around the corner. I don't mean to worry you about edema. In my case they took a lot of lymph nodes as I was positive for endometrial cancer before surgery. So your surgery, if that's what you decide will go much better as it will be more routine. I'm still on the every 3 mo. check up for gyno and I go to the same cancer clinic as my chemo. I am on the six month schedule for breast cancer. 2014, is the year everything changes, I'm looking forward to next year. It is hard seeing the full waiting room. It's especially hard to see the young women. I am still trying to work out at the gym and walking. I also watch what I eat. I would be gigantic if I didn't do these things, it's downright SCARY and depressing!!  Hugs to all and a toast to 4 years! Betsy",

We'll be thinking about you tomorrow. Lena- The way you describe your body is exactly how I feel. I hit 156 lbs and thought holy shit...I have never been this heavy in all my life. I've gained 13 pounds since chemo ended. That's when I started exercising 5x a wk, watching my portions and reduced my alcohol intake. I'm down about 3 pounds in a month. I swear I gain weight just looking at food. It's just not fair but I think we all are feeling frustration on this front. I hope you do better on the next round of drugs. Helen - Of course I'm a little bias, I think you should get a very pretty hat that matches your dress. Unless you don't look good in hats. I love hats at weddings. I say you get beautiful sexy undies and/or splurge on a gorgeous necklace and earings that make you feel wonderful or a pretty shawl that hides the dress. Jazz it up a bit...maybe that will make you feel better about it.   Titan - I'm with you..no way would I let someone else pick a dress for me. If they did...I would somehow make it my own (jazzing it up that is!). Judy - how is your heartburn doing? You haven't written about it so I'm hoping no news is good news. Geri - I'm waiting for your final last tx for that martini. I'm on a diet ya know! My uncles service was really nice. I got to see four of my five siblings. We all stayed at the same hotel and everyone came to our room for wine & choc. We toast my uncle & my mom (the last one standing) and had a great time with them. Yes...I did drink too much wine, so much for the diet. Then next day we all went to the church together and surprised my cousins. None of them knew we were coming. Several of them started crying when they saw all of us. My mom, who was to ill to make the trip, was happy that we filled an entire pew in the church. It was sad and joyous at the same time. A lot like life is every day. Through our sadness, frustrations, fears and pain...we still experience joy, love and laughter. Life is truly amazing. PS all my siblings were surprised at my curls.",

But between events my dh & I took a four mile hike on the Deschutes River. It was wonderful. The next day we drove to the Lava beds and hiked for about another 1.5 miles. Then went to Benham Falls and hiked into it another 1.5 miles. After all that walking we went back to the hotel and took a two hour nap. I was so happy that I could keep up with my dh. Two months ago, I know I couldn't have done it. So I feel happy to be making baby steps forward. My heart goes out to those of you still struggling with aches and pains. HUGS Betsy",

Sorry for the late congrats...BUT CLINK CLINK (tonight anyway) TO GERI!!! I am so happy for you. Lena- our utility room, as I called it, is really just a laundry room with a washer & dryer and a folding table. No sh-lopping baskets up and down stairs to the laundry room. It's one of the main reasons we bought this house...it is so convenient. Now it's our kitchen too..double duty. Thankfully the weather here (which has been more like winter) has finally turned. Although today it's cold and cloudy again. Now our house has zero heat retention cause the ceiling is gone so we feel it even more. The night temp is in the 50's but with night sweats...I don't really mind it much. I cooked outside on Wednesday night, it worked out ok. I think this weekend we are going to rearrange \"the kitchen\". I've also been trying to lose weight. I use a modified South Beach Diet. Mostly because I like the recipes in the book and it makes sense to me. Prior to chemo my dh & I went to a nutrition and cancer class. They recommend a Mediterranean diet as part of the cancer healing process. That's what we've been trying to stick with...unfortunately I don't seem to be losing much weight. I think I'm fighting the Tamox. but at least I'm not gaining. I guess that's positive. I think we all need to keep supporting each other on this front. Exercise and portion control...my new mantra. I think I'm doing ok on the portion control...but I really need to step up on the exercise front. Yesterday, I got really down too. Mostly because of work. We has an assessment deadline, mandatory state deadline, and the stories as to why people couldn't pay...it was just so sad. I had at least three attorney's cry or tear up on me. I was on the telephone with a guy  for a half and hour who's wife had stage 4 colon cancer, MS and many many complications. They had to drive 5 hours for her surgery/treatments. Of course his practice is falling apart he has no time to focus on it, he is the primary caregiver. He wanted to just talk. It just made me so depressed and sad. I think I look at things so differently now. This week, I realized how stressed I was by the very nature of my job. We were very short staffed this assessment cycle. Three out of five people in my dept. were gone. But my boss is coming back from his sabbatical (3 mos) and next Thurs. one of the staff members will return. Then work life should get back to normal. But I feel very very tired. Too much going on right now. .",

There were six great grand kids under the age of 4...so it was a lot of fun.  Gotto go...I'll be back. Betsy",

I go in tomorrow for another PT. My shoulder is acting up again, even though I've been very good for the past month and a half about exercise. Originally my PT told me many women with truncal LE resolve it with time. Mine seems to be pretty persistent and it sort of pisses me off. My boob has been swelling all week. My DH thinks I'm in a mood tonight...well maybe he is right. But damn it...I deserve to be in a mood every once in a while. If he had a swollen boob he'd be cranky too. My dinner party turned out well. I didn't even get all stressed out (my usual MO). It was great seeing my friends. We've gotten together for about 15 years now. Verdict...they couldn't believe the transformation of my kitchen. It's amazing what taking out a wall and raising a ceiling does for a room.",

Titan and Judy...I have a new appreciation of my body as of late and always feel like there is something \"aka cancer\" lurking...it sort of sucks...to put it bluntly.  So I completely understand your posts. I know that stress can cause inflammation and inflammation of cells is bad...so stress=cancer in my mind. Work =stress. I do want to rejoice in being alive and feeling better than I felt last year at this time. The acupuncture is working very well. I don't feel my breast constantly, which is a major relief. Lena...not sure why but this last session I definitely felt one needle. It hurt for a couple of days post the session, but now...amazingly I feel better than I have in months. Its mysteriously amazing to me. After all the western medicine...trial drugs, LE massage, antibiotics..acupuncture is what has worked for me. All I can say is TG!  Geri...you made me laugh at your post about needles. I have plenty of target areas on my body for the dr. to aim at...maybe that's why they are so effective. LOL... Ok...I am being honest. While on my latest diet I have gained 5 pounds. I am pushing my top weight ever. I have been working out at the gym and watching what I'm eating but am getting very discouraged. But I have been stressed and stress = inflamation and inflamation =weight gain for me. I must learn to manage my stress better. The lady I work with has been release from the hospital today, she has gone to a rehab center. She has a long recovery ahead of her. It's very sad. She is alone, her family is not very supportive(very self absorbed) and she has a very long recovery ahead of her. Her situation makes me feel happy to be healthy and active. Things could be much worse so I say ...LIFE IS GOOD. Cancer sucks...but live life NOW. Titan we have a new recruit with Amy...Go Ducks! The Ducks are a 4th quarter team. Don't give up on them early...they come on strong at the end. I have the feeling Auburn will dominate early..but the Ducks will pull it out in the end.  Ever the optimist! Wishing you all a healthy and happy new year. I think we should try to meet in the fall of 2011. How about somewhere on the east coast as I'm the only west coast post. Name the weekend and location and I will be there. If I can come from the west...the rest of you have no excuses. I would love to see NY, DC or Boston. Helen...would any of those locations be easy for you? When does your school year start, maybe we could plan it just before you start your year. Titan, Geri or Judy...will you organize it?",

Although mine was focused on my nodes, as only two were removed during surgery, the flash path report showed no cancer. Post surgery it came back with cancer and so the rads main goal was to fry my nodes...well they did a good job of it.  I did ok with energy going through rads but I got burnt to a crisp...actually my skin turned black and my surgery scar totally fell off. Most drs can't find where the surgery site was, they always say oh there...I say no that's where the cosmetic portion was then I have to point to the scar. Actually, I guess that's a good thing I can say about rads. The worst part of rads was the daily trips to the drs. It was a pretty easy process until the last two weeks for me too. BTW I was the only one on the rads board that had super bad burning. I'm I recalling this correctly Titan? Today my rose bush poke blistered up so I had to call the doctor, I think it might be an allergic reaction to the topical antibiotics. I'm feeling tired again. My assistant starts her sabbatical tomorrow (3 mos) so my work load is doubled. If I can make it through mid July (our busy time) I will be fine.  Oh well...not much I can do about it. It doesn't help that I have a cold on top of everything. I hope everyone is doing ok. I'm glad to hear somewhere in this world the weather is good. Spring has yet to start here in Oregon.

The answer is no. So today was my last tamox. The triage nurse asked the doctor about the percentage of people on tamox that develop uterine cancer (endometiral lining is the lining of the uterus) answer is:  2%. Recall, I have been the queen of se's for just about every drug I've been on. GRRRRR. The triage nurse greeted me with \"shit, damn this just sucks\". I couldn't have stated it better myself, which of course made me LOL. I told her I most likely will not go on AL, do to my propensity to get the worse se on the list. No way am I dealing with those se's. So after surgery I plan to see a naturopath and a dietitian. I have my appointment next Wednesday at 3:00. That's when I get the battle plan. Based off my research on the Internet, it's pretty standard to do a complete hysterectomy including a bilateral sapingo-oophorectemy (removal of the ovaries & fallopian tubes) with Stage 1. I don't know my stage yet but the grade is 1 (1 out of 3) which is good. I asked the person scheduling me what the GYN Onc's appointment schedule looked like he said he was pretty much booked up through Oct. So I think surgery will happen some time in November. At least that's my WAG. The staging looks even more complicated than bc. Lena, to answer your question as to why a got a different onc. It's because he is a surgical specialist for GYN and my breast Onc just specialized in breast surgery. My medical onc manages all the different specialists. My regular GYN said I need to go to a specialist. So hence a new onc. I seem to be collecting them. I think they think this is a new cancer, not necessarily related to bc. Although, many of the same issues (excess estrogen) cause endometrial cancer. So there you have it all ladies. Amy and any one else on tamox if you have any unusual discharge get into your GYN ASAP. I'm thankful I didn't ignore it, like I wanted to. Amy & Helen-good luck with your appts. As Roseanna Roseanna Dana said \"IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING\".",

I'm shooting for surgery on Nov. 11th but have to wait to hear if the OR is available. If it's not, it will be some day the following week. The dr. is planning on using the Davinci machine (I envision Edward Scissorhands working a computer) scary! The dr was very nice, he is in the same group as my medical onc. He was very honest and explained once again about grading and staging. With grade one he said it's not aggressive (unlike my grade 3 IDC), so that's positive. He said I only have two options as I am PR+, surgery or rads. I said no way to rads so surgery is my only option. I don't need any of those female organs anymore anyway, right. I'm just hoping they weigh at least 10 lbs....automatic weight loss plan, right! LOL  Titan...welcome back...a good kick in the freakin smart ass is what you needed to get back here. But I'm really glad your back. I missed that twisted sense of humor.  I need to wait to view your pics as I'm exhausted tonight. Lena...I know what you mean about grossed out....but really changing the bandage after a while will be a piece of cake. It's not that bad when you get the hang of it. I dealt with somewhat of a similar, but much more SMELLY situation ,TG you don't have to deal with that! You are strong, you can do it and once the area heals up, it won't be as scary. Likewise, getting things wet in a while will not be as scary either. My ldh had a make shift ostomy bag for over a year plus a groshong (like a port-a-cath). He was fed Hyper-Al (food in a bag for a year) and he was able to do most things by himself eventually. Frankly, it didn't bother me either once I got use to it. I was happy that he was alive...I didn't care that he had bags and tubes. I bet for sure that Pat Rack feels exactly like I did. When you love someone...that's what matters. Hi to everyone else...I need to go to bed, it's late and I'm exhausted. Hugs right back to all of you. Thank you for the support....I really, really need it right now. Betsy ",

It will be Friday afternoon/night for most you, Judy...not sure about your timing, so please click those glasses of your drink of choice in my honor and send good vibrations to the doctor. He is planning on using the daVinci machine hence the length of time for the surgery. Hopefully only one night in the hospital. I love the idea of you all being in the OR with me. You are my support team and it means SO MUCH. My chart is marked LIDOCAINE...THANKS Lena, great idea. During my blood draw yesterday, I got the best phlebotomist ever. He did his magic, only one poke. He called my vein \"a bouncy little thing\".  He also was teaching a newbie and said to her my problem is that most people think my veins are deep, they go to far and can't get them (hence the digging). I guess they are very tiny but close to the surface. Good thing to know for the future. I have a bright pink LYMPHEDEMA band to wear also. Plus I will be wearing my sleeve and gauntlet. Chemo brain is still very alive and well with me. I swear yesterday in my appointments, I could hardly talk intelligently. The word search is so freaken frustrating. It's in my typing too...so please excuse any wrong words. I will be drugged up over the next few weeks...so I guess I can use that as an excuse. I won't post again but will have my dh send Amy (I have her email address) an update after surgery. I may not be back to the board for a while but I already feel your strength. Keep sending me those good vibrations. I may ask if they will play the Beach Boys Good Vibrations duing surgery, just the thought of it makes me smile.",

If could just keep food moving in my system, I'd be a very bruised happy camper. I am so bruised and swollen it's ridiculous. My pelvic area is black and blue and if you didn't know better you'd think I was the one in the roll over accident. I actually called the nurse today and said...how much swelling and bruising is normal..its crazy. They gave me anti coagulant drugs before, during and after surgery so I'm about four sizes larger than normal. My wonderful sister and dh are helping in the count down for the first BM. It's a pretty sick discussion. My sister said it's been in you so long that when if finally comes we should name it! LOL until my stomach hurt (which doesn't take much). I'm also dealing with fluid in my lungs. This has not been a smooth recovery. I have so much senna and miralax on board it's going to be scary when things start moving in me. I vomited for 4 days before the gave me prescription anti nausa meds. -totally crazy. I even spoke to the doctor in advance of my surgery about my slow bowels...I had no idea they would just stop. Thank you guys for the support. I felt you in the operating room with me. You were a calming influence. I can't sit at the computer any longer. Oh..one last note. No cancer in the cervix, nodes or ovaries and tubs. TG - Wed. I have my post op to hear more of the details and staging. signing off... Betsy",

Now the onc says there are stats that additional 5 years on it might be very helpful. They keep moving the target time out. Sometimes I wonder if this is the way drug companies keep up their bottomline?  I refused the AI's based on SE's. My onc said I've already had the worst possible SE on tamox, so I might as well stay on it.  Based on the stats...I figured I will stay on it because I certainly don't want a repeat of the past two years. Helen...congratulations! Tomorrow I head back to work part time. I've enjoyed this past week of recovery, I've had pretty decent energy although I can't lift or exercise (other than walking) for two more weeks. I plan to ease into work through the rest of this month. I just don't have the energy to do otherwise. This surgery really set me back physically.",

Helen, thanks for sharing. I knew parts of your story but not the entire story. I did not realize BRCA had a pancreatic cancer component to it. Maybe I heard it at some point but didn't recall it. So in many ways I'm struggling with some of the same issues a BRCA+ dx has caused the rest of you.  I still haven't heard from my counselor, so know appointment is scheduled as yet. At least today, I'm feeling better about everything. Judy...you cracked me up worrying about me and \"ignorance\". I do feel ignorant about most of this medical stuff, there is far to much information to digest most of the time. You can call me ignorant any time...but not \"an ignorant slut\"...as I recall that is what Dan Akroid called Jane on Sat. Night Live.

I called the onc this morning because it seems to be getting worse.  He said with my recent abdominal surgery and because I am taking tamox he was concerned about a blood clot. But I'm happy to report, no blood clot just edema. I'm thinking more lymphedema...now in my leg. Other than the leg swelling my arm and chest are slowing improving. I have an appt. with my LE specialist on Mar 16th. Does this ever end?  I will say a prayer for all of you as we honor our anniversary. I'm thinking of Lena too! Wishing you all a good week. Betsy",

If the swelling goes down in the immediate area but your arm is generally achy then the blood draw attempt might have triggered lymphedema. Stay on top of it. If it causes you problems for more than two weeks, have a dr. look at it and refer you to a LE specialist (they can work magic). I went to my LE specialist yesterday due to the new edema in my leg and flare up in my arm. I couldn't see my ankle bone when I walked in and after the MLD (manual lymph drainage) I could see the bone. I even lost 2 lbs overnight. Amazing. Now for the really GOOD NEWS - my genetic test results...drum roll please - NEGATIVE for genetic mutations!!!! About freakin time I could share some good news. I was getting depressed with my writing on this board. I couldn't believe how uptight I was yesterday. After the dr. appt. my db took me to lunch, he said I needed to decompress before returning to work. I was bouncing off the walls yesterday with happiness. BTW -unlike what the counselor indicated b4 she said my sisters don't have to be tested. I know she told me the last time that even if I was B9, my sisters might not be and should be tested. Oh well, regardless it's excellent news. I can breathe again!!!! I'm moving on in the genetic result area. I joined a test out of the Cleveland Clinic for genetic markers on PTEN. Since it's a study it will take a very long time to get results. As long as there are no drugs involved I told her I was happy to assist with scientific result. So it's official I'm in the .5% - most likely tamoxifin caused my endometrial cancer. Lucky me but at least its all resolved. My arm and chest LE have flared up again while trying on some compression pantyhose. OMG...I thought the arm compression was bad, I couldn't even get the damn stockings over the ball of my foot. It took me...I'm not kidding...about five minutes to get them on with the help of the clerk. Working the stockings caused my chest and arm to flare.  I said \"screw this, if I can't put them on then I'm not going to wear them. I'll be damned if I'm going to make my dh dress me in the morning.\" So I ordered some thigh high garments and knee highs for traveling. They are so ugly and freaking expensive. But who needs a gym when I get a work out just dressing. It's sad but pretty funny too! LOL So I wear some non-medical compression pantyhose, the type RiteAid sells, under my workout clothes at the gym per my LE specialist recommendation. So what happens...they rub sores on my legs between my thighs. Just like my arm...open sores are not a good thing so my legs swelled even more. I'm trying to do the right thing but I think sometimes the stars are lined up against me. Regardless...I'm one happy camper today, albeit, with big legs and sores but B9 for a really nasty genetic mutation. I hope everyone is well. We've had snow for the past four days off and on. Yesterday I woke up to an 1.5. The weather has really been bizarre this winter. Tomorrow it's suppose to be in the 60's.   ",

My therapist was saying just think of how much you have lived through over the past three years. She was saying don't cancel my my trip, go for it! I just burst into tears. She said what wrong? I said it's easy for you to say but dealing with ankle pain and elbow pain constantly is easier said than done. It wears me down. She still said...GO...enjoy life, live life. If your leg swells, we can deal with it. She is going to show me how to wrap it to assist with the swelling. I am feeling very emotional these days. Maybe because of the hysto? maybe tamox? maybe depression? maybe just cause I'm fighting vertigo on top of everything else? I told her I'm in over load and I need a break. She agreed. She said I was doing everything right but my body is not responding quick enough for me. Again, I need to learn to be more patient. So I cancelled my next appt. with her. I am taking most of May off from Dr. visits. I also told her I was placing a moratorium on Dr. appts. during my sabbatical. I am de-stressing on multiple fronts. On a positive front, weight watchers has been helping. I've dropped 5 pounds. Still have ten to go but I'm feeling better. My PT also said the best thing I could to for my LE is lose weight. I'm not celebrating yet, when I hit the 10 lb mark, I know I will feel better. Time for cores. Hugs to all and thanks for all your support as of late. Titan- I haven't had chance to hear out this years UO team. I think they should be pretty good as two years ago they lost a lot of the veteran players. So the team is still fairly young. Glad to hear OSU is going to be good. How much longer until you can play in Bowl games?",

We took a walk today in Elk Cove Gardens, a beautiful garden over looking the Willamette River and has a stunning view of Mt. Hood. Afterward we walked in the neighborhood. I'm trying to prep for 4 hours of being on my feet. So far so good. We walked for about two hours, my foot is throbbing a bit, but not bad. I'm planning on going on the trip in Sept. We are thinking of flying somewhere in the US in early August to test flying. Good excuse for a trip. My sabbatical starts then and my assistant said plan a trip, it will force you to leave town and truly start your sabbatical when you want too. I have a computer conversion that I'm managing and the final phase is scheduled for mid-July. I thought that was good advise. It will force me to leave.   Judy I'm so glad your test turned out well. I'm feeling so much better. I just needed a break from going to the doctor 1 to 2 times a week for months on end. My PT called me at work this past week to check up on me. She asked if I went to the doctor for my vertigo? I said no. I told her I knew it was improving although when I saw her it was bad, mostly cause I moved my head too fast. I have one more week of NO DRS. I'm a happy camper. After that its a string of appointments. Weight loss is still moving in the right direction, albeit, ever so slowly. I do feel better. On my scales I'm down 8 lbs. At weight watchers, its only 4 - but I weigh in after work and fully clothed. Titan - no worries about the teasing...I love it, keep it coming. Right after I wrote one of our UO players that was a Junior was drafted to the pros. So who knows how the Ducks will be this year?   Amy your SE sounds horrible. I hope things are improving for you.

I really like her. All is well on the cancer front. She wants me to go to my GP for the edema. My bp was very high 154/105. I think they may mix up my bp meds. Also went to acupuncture on Friday. For what ever reason the needles in my left arm (non-bc arm TG) caused all sorts of problems. My wrist, hand and elbow are all inflamed now. I may step back from acupuncture if the swelling doesn't go down. So now both elbows are bad. My weak arm currently feels better than my good arm. All I can say is WTF! Tomorrow I have an appt with my GYN onc. I think all is well on that front. Amy-I know exactly how you feel. I hate funerals but I'm sure your presence was a support to your friend. Crying is a part of healing from emotional trauma and we've all been through a mental trauma in addition to a physical assault.  Occasionally a good cry is very healthy. You never know, your cry may give others the freedom to cry when it's their time to mourn. Judy gave me a good healthy cry by her post of her son and I feel better for it. So thank you Judy.

I went for a sisters weekend last weekend and came home to a home invasion/murder in our neighborhood. We were in lock down most of this past week. No going outside, doors and windows locked at all times. TG the guy was arrested today. He is a nut case that has a rap sheet a mile long. The sad thing is he killed a man, age 57, that just retired this past summer. His wife and him walked their dog daily and while they were out the guy broke into their home. I guess they came home too early and the guy stab our neighbor. Sad, sad, sad. We live in a normally very safe neighborhood, but this crime has jolted everyone. The house is on my daily walking path. We are getting ready for our trip to New England. It should be fun. My biggest issue is how to wear my compression boot on the plane. I think I have it worked out, wearing a pair of flip-flops with it. I just know I will have to use the restroom and didn't want my boot to touch the filthy floors. Just the thought gives me the willies. I started taking aspirin to thin my blood per one of my drs. recommendation. Geri - I'm sorry you are not feeling better. Sending you a big hug. I am loving my sabbatical, I don't want to go back to work. I feel better than I have in years. Stress does do a number on us. I hope you have cut back from work.

Wishing you and your family strength and love through this difficult time. Helen- kudos on the published article. That is wonderful. Titan - Sorry to hear your daughter is stressed. Thyroid meds can cause anxiety, at least they did in my sister. Hugs to my fav nut! My younger sisters alzheimers is progressing fast. It is SO sad. I shed a few tears after my sisters weekend. We may have bodies that don't work right but to lose your memory and basic skills has to be frightening. Chemo brain doesn't even come close and you know how much I bitched about that! Sadness fills my heart for her. Amy - I'm happy for your new launch, it sounds like it went well. Hang in there, hopefully your work will settle down soon. Leslie - glad you are feeling better and are healing.

Cancer sucks in all it's degrees and forms. I think we are fortunate, we've supported each other by walking side by side through this and all our trials together for which I am truly thankful. To give our support to anyone with dx of cancer is a blessing that each of us can choose to give as we are all in this together.    A good subject Lesley, thanks for posing the question. I think it made us all think. I'm back a work, it's amazing how quickly the restful feeling evaporated. I'm back in the grind. Oh well it was fun while it lasted. A very rainy weekend here in the NW. Hope everyone on the east coast stays safe.",

I'm not use to hosting as I always went to Seattle to visit my folks. But my sister is getting a divorce and my brother & his dw didn't have anywhere to go so they are being added to my dh's family. I think the count is up to 15 at the most, I'm hoping 3 will not show (they are iffy). It was only about 5 years ago that I even started eating poultry. I still don't eat red meat. So cooking a turkey is a new thing. The good thing is everyone is a good sport and pitches in. So I guess I shouldn't worry. I stayed on tamoxifen as I already experienced the worst SE (endometrial cancer). I choose the evil that I know instead of Al's. Al's have a slightly higher risk for blot clots, so that made of my mind. The onc quit even asking me to switch. I guess that is a good thing. I went to my GI dr and will be schedule for a colonoscopy soon, next month or two. He swears I have Lynch syndrome and is treating me for it, even though my genetic tests were neg. He says they only tested five sequences and there are many more. I told him I did not have it and would give him two years between exams, if after that time I have a clear test, then I will most likely move to three years. He said do you argue with your Priest or Rabbi like this? I laughed and said \"of course!\" and smiled. Hey it's my body. He was mad at me for not having a colonoscopy in the past four years. I said, it was not like I was sitting around twittling my thumbs, I had a few other serious issues to deal with. He gave me that one. I'm glad it's been quiet on this board, that means everyone is feeling pretty good and doing ok. I'm thinking of my dad today. He was a Veteran of WW2 and a prisoner of war in Germany. I miss him and feel thankful to him and all the other Vets that have made America safer. Betsy",

He didn't say what my follow up schedule will be, probably once a year. Which is fine by me...maybe time for another cartwheel! LOL...the one I did after chemo was so pathetic!

I was reading through my old posts today as I'm writing up a helpful hints letter to a women I work with. She is getting her port tomorrow and starts ACT mid month. Boy reading through the post brought back all sorts of memories. Do any of you remember things that really worked for you? If so let me know. I'm at almost two pages of information. Example use a #2 blade when cutting your hair short and when you shave your head it feels so much better. Length of chemo treatment 3-4 hours. Just the basics. Judy I told her about Prilosec for heartburn. It made me feel so thankful for all of you. I didn't have anyone that I knew who was or had walked this path. So I leaned on all of you and all tHe others that posted on the AC/ T boards. Flobro & Helen I hope both of you are doing well. Geri when is the wedding? Sounds like you are busy and life is full which is a good thing. We admitted my MIL to a memory care facility last week.. Very stressful time for my dh and his family. She is in a much safer place and his dad is much safer too. She has already punched a staff person in the stomach. I think she was abusing my FIL. Sad. So it's all for the best. Speaking of crazy, how's my favorite nut? Haven't heard from you in a while? Hope all is well with you. Hugs to all. Betsy",

Amy it has taken me almost two years from my hysto to recover. I still have leg edema from my surgery. It does really mess with the few hormones we have left in our bodies. It takes time to heal. We need to give our bodies time and TLC. My onc also said the studies now say 10 years instead of 5 for AIs and tamoxifen. I'm not sure I'm going to follow the new protocol. There is big part of me that thinks the studies are just part of the drug industry's cash machine and we are being strung along for a ride. When I questioned my onc about it he said \"well really the studies showed two additional years showed the highest statistical outcomes\". There is a part of me that thinks the weight gain I've experienced is as harmful and the little bit of estrogen that my body now throws off. Michelle..I know you quit tamoxifen/AL. Has it been easier to lose weight? What does everyone else think about this? ",

I guess my second cancer reset the onc clock. So I have three more years of every six months.  I started another research study throughout OHSU. It is a study for post chemo women (not just bc but any cancer). It focuses on balance issues. Did you know women that have gone through chemo tend to fall more as they age? The study focuses on the effects of three different exercise programs. I'm in the Tai Chi class and love it. It causes my leg a little problem, as I'm still dealing with edema, but it's wonderful. At least I feel like I'm doing something positive. The other programs are strength training and flexibility training. We didn't get to pick our class, it was totally random.

I'm recalling my first visit with my surgeon, then the medical onc. I'm hoping this time around it won't be as overwhelming. At least I know the difference between staging and grades of cancer. Lena...it's hard to believe they've pulled so much fluid out of you! Is the catheter hooked to a bag? Like an ostomy bag? Just curious. I hope you don't mind me asking. It brings back memories of the \"moving ostomy\" my LDH had. He had a fistula of the small bowel that drained through his incision for a year until they did corrective surgery. Many times in the middle of the night the stoma would leak, because the leak had shifted on his incision, which caused me to re-template the stoma. I got pretty good at it and it was no small task. You had to look at everything backwards. One time in the midded of the night we got to laughing so hard because I was patting myself on the back...thinking I had just created an artist masterpiece. He even let me take his picture. He got the last laugh, my masterpiece did not hold and I had to start all over.  Back then I called myself \"an official bag lady\". I've always had a fondness for bag ladies since then. I'll try to let you all know tomorrow how things went. I have a very long day scheduled. 4 interviews in the morning, flu shot, and new onc appointment. So if I don't make it online, I will definately write on Thurs. Happy Belated Thanksgiving Helen!",

Thankfully, it sounds like her/your family is very supportive and will be there for her no matter what she decides. Lena- I still don't understand sims, but I'm glad you enjoy them. Not even freaking sure sims are a \"them\", oh well. I just loved the visual of you feeding a rat with your Moon cookies. Even though I don't have the foggiest idea what you look like, I can see you.   I think another planting season is a perfect thing to put and keep on your bucket list. I love to garden, there is nothing like playing in the dirt. Did I tell you we just finished planting our blueberry bed? I got three new blueberries (Early, Mid & Late season) varieties to add to my miniature blueberry plant. Tonight is our first frost warning. I pulled my tomatoes out this past weekend. I made some Borscht this weekend with red cabbage and beets from my garden. Yummy. Tomorrow's my CT scan, chest x-ray and EKG. I really want to just ignore all of this. But I will be a good girl and suck it up. GRRRRR",

My dh cancelled our trip to Maui in March on my suggestion. If we leave town we can head to California for warm weather. It's closer and if I'm not up to it, it won't be as expensive to cancel. Bummer to think that way but it's realistic. Oh my replacement (that's how I'm looking at my new staff person) is starting Tuesday. I have ten days to train her before my surgery. Hopefully she is a quick learner.",

My leg is still swollen but I have a PT appt on Friday, hopefully she will give me pointers on what to do to improve the swelling. Today we woke up to snow! It's been snowing most of the morning but the temp is just warm enough that it melts when it hits the ground. I'm on vacation this week too...boy I could get use to this pace of life. Judy congrats on your new job. Remember starting a new job is very stressful, so take care and be kind to yourself. Now you have one more ball to add to the balls you are already juggling. Titan...sorry to read about the others on your TN thread. GRRRRR...bc sucks.  Geri- sending you a belated hug. Sorry to hear about your friend and little one. Each time I hear of another loss, it makes me feel sad but then I'm thankful to be breathing today. It helps me stay focused on living each day to the fullest. Amy - my dh has taught me two things re: insomnia. First if I can't sleep its most likely that I have to pee. Also, if my mind is working and can't stop thinking about something...usually work related. If you get up and jot down what you want to remember or are thinking about it helps. He keeps a pad of paper and pencil by the bed. Neither of them help hot flashes or chemical insomnia but they do help me from time to time. Helen - I hope you are doing well and enjoying your retirement. Have you felt like you've gone through a major transition? I decided to call my onc yesterday as he wanted me to come in to discuss AI's but I left a message for the nurse saying that I will not go on AI's and plan to stay on tamox. If that's not ok, he can call me back. It's either tamox or nothing for me. I re-read all the AI SE's and I just can't go there. My dh supports my decision. I also plan to take myself off of tamox. for my three month sabbatical to avoid the potential of a blood clot when flying to Eastern Europe. They have told me to stop it several times now, so I guess it's ok. I will go right back on it when I return from my trip. I haven't decided whether to tell my onc about this decision but I have plenty of time before I fly so we'll see. Still no news on the genetic testing front, they are still dealing with my insurance. The nurse thought I'd hear my results sometime next week.",

I did go see a ND. She said I needed to reduce stress. My job has been and will be stressful until my sabbatical. She wants me to go to a yoga class or listen to meditation tapes. I broke down in her office and said I'm just damn sick of everything. Dr. appts., what to do lists, everybody telling what I s/b doing. Her perspective is I've been doing everything right but it's not working, so maybe the Western way (drugs, exercise) is not what I should be focusing on. She wants me to pray/meditate daily, no weight barring exercises, keep walking, focus on building muscle mass not losing weight. She had a very calming affect on me. I'm glad I went to see her. In June, we have two acupuncture appts scheduled. She loved the idea of no drs. appts during my sabbatical. She said that's the right type of mental attitude. My GE appt. also went well. I'm on a stay the course plan. My fissure has not completely healed yet but it is improving. My bowels are working fairly normally with fiber one cereal, miralax and stool softeners daily. About freakin time! I now understand why old people get obsessed with their bowels. I know I'm full of shit but it's a crappy existence! lol Judy...Lena has been on my mind lately too. I think its close to her birthday. Yesterday was mine...no wonder I'm feeling old. This bd has been harder on me then I expected. I'm closer to 60 now than 50. Mentally it's hard to get my mind around but physically my body is confirming it. I think in June we should all have a piece of cheesecake in memory of Lena. Judy I'm so sorry about your friend. I know it's difficult on you. But you are such a supportive person, I know your friend feels strength through your friendship. You are helping her by just being there for her.  Amy...when are you coming West? Do you have final dates when you are heading to Seattle. I have a Lake Cresent  (Olympic National Park)  Day hike map than I keep meaning to bring to work and scan for you. I will try to do it this week and send it off to you. Titan, Geri & Helen - Hope you are all doing well. Geri...oooh a two hour commute. Sounds awful. Wishing you all happy holidays (Memorial Day, belated Victoria Day, & Harvest Festival).

I spoke with her on Tuesday night and he died Wednesday. She is 90 and full of life. I hope to be like her when I'm her age. She reminds me of my Mom, who I really, really, miss. My Mom died a year ago in May. She has been on my mind a lot lately. I am also super sad for my sister. She is aged 53 and the plaque in her brain is increasing. It is so sad. My brother said her dh, said he is hoping he has another 5 years with her. I am so, so, sad. My sister is such a loving and joyful person. It is hard for me to believe that she will not remember me in a few years. Cancer sucks...but other unknown diseases are just as bad.   I still feel like I take a few steps forward then get knocked back several steps by life. I'm trying to stay positive but sometimes it's very hard. In a month in a half, I'm taking my sabbatical. 3 months of no work, no doctors....just health. I'm really looking forward to it. My sisters are getting together for a sister's weekend, which will be good. Amy, I know it's emotionally draining when dealing with other with cancer but I'm sure you gave your friend a lot of support and that is worth it. \"The good of the many outweights the good of the few or the one.\" Wishing you all the best.

I quit going to the NP, after my arm flare up I've decide if I want more acupuncture I will go back to my Chinese dr. He never hurt me. The NP, was just guessing, I could tell she wasn't certain. The good thing is, even if she wasn't certain, my leg swelling is going down. It may just be coincidence but regardless it's moving in the right direction. I went to my GP and got a script for lasiks for when I travel. She said, plan on swelling. It's going to happen...so just plan on it. She also recommended I go two days in advance of my tour. It all depends on airfares as to how realistic that will be. I'm just happy I have a plan B. I've also ordered a Jovi pack for my leg...it really helps with my chest when it swells so I'm keeping my fingers crossed the same will be true with my leg. I love my gentle yoga class. I actually think that is what is changing my physical being. It feels so good and I think that's why my leg swelling is improving.   Judy it sounds like you are starting to do really fun things and focusing on LIFE. You go girl!  Helen..sorry to hear you are still struggling with hair issues. I casually mentioned to my DH that if I lose 10 more pounds, I'd buzz my hair again and he said REALLY?. He made me stop and repeat it...in an excited way...and said he loved my hair that short. I was SHOCKED. So even though I was hoping to grow my hair out, I plan on a pixie cut soon. I never imagined that this would be the outcome from chemo. So the hair one person treasures may be an opportunity for another. Strange how life is? Sending hugs. Hey Geri, Amy and Titan...hope you are having a good summer. I know most of you are experiencing heat...here in the NW, it's been wet and cool. Happy summer to all. Betsy",

I did have my cervix removed, as I did have a cancer dx prior to surgery. It wasn't an option for me. I'm proud you gave them hell. I did develop edema from my surgery, so that dr was wrong. It can happen. I can also relate on your feelings about more genetic testing. I'm still waiting for my P10 results from the trial I'm in with the Cleveland Clinic. I felt a little like Henreitta Lacks when I donated my blood. Being sliced and diced, poked and prodded makes me feel like a lab animal instead of a human being. I'm throwing this out to the group. I have one year left on Tamoxifen. Have any of you with +ER/+PR quit your hormone therapies? I'm starting to think this is just a grand test and the oncs really are just using all of us. Since my hysto my vaginal dryness has gotten much worse. My tissue has deteriorated to paper thin and it's very uncomfortable. I think with my ovaries removed the dose I'm on is too high. I'm just curious if anyone else has thought of quitting their therapy? This weekend I felt like my old self again for the first time. I worked for about 5 hours in my garden. I was sore but it felt great. My energy level is finally back. TG. I'm not sure who typed they still had chemo brian but I can relate. When I'm tired, I feel it's worse.

I'm stopping it because we are planning a three week trip to France in September and I'm worried about blood clots. Secretly I'm hoping the pounds will melt away when I stop taking it, but only time will tell.

Went in for my first ever breast MRI, didnt think anything about it until I got the call back. Had an ultrasound...so now they are monitoring the area. TG NED. its on the non bc breast so i told my dh at least if there is a problem they can make the girls match up. but that is a story for another day...or hopeully never. my resolution this year is to get and stay healthy. i start my second tia chi class next week and i also am taking a gentle yoga class. wishing you all health and happiness this next year. hugs betsy",

It totally sucks. I know how I felt when they did genetic testing on me and the counselor swore I would be positive for Lynch Syndrome based on my family history. In my case, she was wrong and I ended up neg. I am still waiting on a second genetic test thru the Cleveland Clinc. Just when you think you are close to the finish line, your target moves. Not fair. Judy sorry to hear your daughter is still a heartache for you. You sound like such a loving and caring Mom. Again....life isn't fair. Amy...horrible news about your neighbors. Did you decide to quit the AIs? Helen..sorry I didn't go back far enough to catch up on you. I hope all is well for u. Life has been good for me. I love retirement, best decision I ever made was to quit my job. It had become super stressful and very unhealthly. I am still on tamoxifen they said at the five year mark now they are recommending 10 years followup. I will give it 7 yrs, then reassess. My edema in my arm rarely causes me trouble, my leg is still problematic but I've learned to live with it. Not that I have a choice but it's not bad and doesn't slow me down much. HUGS TO ALL....until next time. Betsy PS Happy Belated Birthday Judy ",

I think it feels great and I just don't care how it looks to others! Maybe it's because I'm blessed with a fairly nice shaped head - I don't know. My hair was very thick, dark (few grays) and wavy. I thought being bald would be awful. At my first onc's office visit they had a book of photos of all these very different bald and very beautiful women. To me it was very empowering. At first I was embarrassed, now I think screw it. Plus, I love hats and don't plan to give them up even when my hair (probably all gray) grows back. But I have to admit, I will be happier when it all grows back in as it means chemo won't be controlling my life any longer. I've been asked to be in multiple drug studies and have turned every single one of them down due to the SE's. I think it seems somewhat unethical that the onc doctors are pushing the drug company studies. I think a third party person should be discussing it with patients. I understand the potential benefits - (I've been a recipient) but was shocked at reading the SE's of the four studies presented to me. Isn't it the doctors duty to do no harm to his patient? It seems to be a conflict of interest for them to be pushing something that can do further body damage. Ok there is my rant for today. Leslie and Pam - hang in there. Dawn- each day I feel a little stronger...still not ready to even practice a cartwheel. But I do plan on trying. Betsy",

Unfortunately, that stats and stubs are probably leaning more towards gray based off of age and appearance. Damn...it's hard enough to look at myself in the mirror with a bald head...but no color.

Wavy, short and brown (her original color). The only thing she complained about was no bangs. She said the bangs are so slow!!! We all get to look forward to that stage, I for one, can hardly wait. Titan, I think I'm more obsessed about hair right now than my boob(s). I hope you get there once this biopsy issue is over. Good thing you aren't deep into rads otherwise you'd really be running hot and cold with an ice pack on one side and a blazing boob on the otherside. Sending good thoughts your way.

It can take up to a year if I'm one of the lucky ones otherwise this is the way it is for the rest of my life.  My waffle maker (jovi) really does help keep the swelling down too but kills the sex life.

I did AC first also...then followed up with six weeks rads. What worked for me re: neuropathy...even though I was very resistant at first, was Glutamine (dietary supplement). I was encouraged to take it by my onc nurses. I tried to get at least two tablespoons down per day. The only thing that worked getting it down was ginger ale. Good thing I like ginger ale. At least it stayed suspended in it, otherwise it's like drinking chalk. It did help. Good luck to you and like Amy said...seek out the April 2010 thread. If it's like this group...the friends you meet on the thread will help you get through the lowest of lows and become the best support you could ever imagine. Geri - so sorry to hear about your friend. I will keep her in my prayers. Amy- where are those pics of your new hairdo? I'm going in next week for another cut..I may go super short based on what you wrote. Titan- Are you out there?? Hopefully you didn't get blown away in the weekend storms in Ohio. Very sad indeed. Judy - I'm doing better. My manual lymph drainage seems to do the trick so it was just an minor set back. I have my onc appointment in two weeks. I'm already nervous about the blood draw. My veins are so bad these days. I need to remember to hydrate before the appt. I'm also nervous about my onc appt. because based on the chemical menopause they've put me into I think I will be classified as post menopausal in the next round of testing...which means I need to make a decision on whether to take the next round of drugs or not. A year ago, when they put me on tamox. I told them I would most likely not take the drugs they were pushing a year out. When I read through the SE's they had a lot of bone and joint pain associated with them. I do not want to go there again. I'm going to see if they will keep me on tamox., I've read it's slightly less effective but better than nothing. Lena you might discuss it as an option to Aromasin? Not sure that it won't mess with your hormones but maybe your body would be able to handle it.  Just an idea.",

Some of what I struggled with had to do with the lost of control in my life...everything sort of spun out of control.

Now, they have become burdensome.  I hope when I speak with the LAc, she will be able to give me some help in managing my stress.

Most things in life have come pretty easy for me, for which I'm grateful. Now, I work hard and nothing comes easy. I guess I need to lower the high expectations of myself and learn to adapt to the new me.

All in all our vacation has been very relaxing so far, next week will be our road trip week. My blueberry beds are in. We had the compost delivered today. I plan to plant my blueberry plants tomorrow. Next year I plan to be eating blueberries from my yard all summer. Talk about Yumm..... I haven't heard any results yet. Since we are leaving on Sunday I don't expect to know until next weekend or thereafter. I'm not worried. What will be will be. Wishing you all a good week. I'm signing off for a while. Will write when we return from the north. Betsy",

Can you PM me your email address. I have written up details of our trip and suggested changes but don't know how to do an attachment on this site, its easier for me to just email them to you.  July should be a beautiful time of year to go there. Kudos to your SS...working for Microsoft should be a fabulous experience for him. Seattle is a beautiful city. As you get closer to your trip, let me know if you want any hints as to where to stay in Seattle etc. I go there regularly for family events. Not as much these days after both of my folks passing. But I still have a brother and two sisters there. We've knocked around the idea of moving up there after we retire. I just got home yesterday so still don't have any results on my biopsy. BUT...I got three msgs from the drs office while we were gone. 2 from the nurse and one from the Dr. So based on that, I'm mentally gearing up for bad news. The worst part is the waiting. I couldn't sleep last night. I'm frustrated I am finally feeling better from truncal & arm LE and don't look forward to another procedure to set me back. But I guess it could be worse, so I will not whine too much.  I'll know more tomorrow. Last week my sister, the one that was dx w/cervical cancer was dx with brain damage from the procedure. It has affected the right portion of her brain. My other sister, surgical neuro nurse, thinks she had an air bubble or blood clot that cut off some of the functions of her brain. She has been struggling for a couple years now. She is unable to write, do simple math and process logically.  It makes me very sad and now I'm a little nervous about any more surgeries that I might be in my future. One more thing to worry about..... I'll give you an update tomorrow.",

It always hurts like hell. Anyway, while waiting for the scanning equipment to become available another lady marches into the lab and sits in the chair next to me. When they start trying to access her vein, she starts screaming and I mean at the top of her lungs...LOUD. She starts heavy breathing...the poor guy says I'm so sorry...I didn't realize it hurt so much. Then she says...oh it really doesn't hurt...it's just how I cope. I'm sure the phlebotomist wanted to deck her...if he didn't, I did. She was so obnoxious. But it did take my mind off of everything and I got through it. My only complication is when the contrast was pumped in...it went too fast and my vein almost collapsed...TG the tech caught it. Maybe it was because I started yelling this time, she stopped the procedure, dialed back the rate and all was well. LOL...yelling does work.",

I believe he indicated research showed because I'm ER+/PR+ - Tamoxifen was the most effective drug. Don't get me wrong about my earlier post about drug trials. I think they are very important. My late husband got 5 quality years of extended life due to a drug trial. Funny thing...the drug he was taking was a derivative of Tamoxifen, go figure! We were ready to fly to London to get it but then he got into a Cleveland Clinic study.  My problem with the current situation...it's seems hard to say no to your onc when they are pushing something that can cause major and serious SE's. I for one have had enough joint and bone pain to last a lifetime. In my opinion, discussions for trial drugs should take place outside of the onc visits, not wrapped up within the visit. Then the onc can remain unbiased if you ask him/her questions while contemplating the decision. I can go on and on, but I don't want to rant again...

The weather was nicer than we expected, even though a storm blew in on Sat. night. Just before we left I got a call from the onc's office. As I answered the phone, Rob - the onc nurse said \"well we've got some results of your bone density test\", in one of those tones that you don't want to hear. Of course, I thought SHIT! This doesn't sound good.... Anyway, I have osteopenia and taxomifin apparently contributes to osteoporosis, so they are going to give me the option of one of the study drugs (that I refused because of bone pain)..arrgh!! or flosamax. I just read about the serious side effects of flosamax. Damn...potential for UGI problems, weight gain, rashes and last but not least a painful death of the jaw. Now I need to go back and read all the literature about those damn drug studies. I don't know, my first instinct is maybe I'll just take my chances with osteopenia. I hate taking drugs and it seems like every time I turn around they want me to take another one. My dh is telling me I have to eat dinner. More later... Betsy ",

He put me on Konsyl- psyllium fiber and gave me some ointment for my fissure (left over from the chemo days). Ok, I'm a little slow its been almost three years and frankly it was the last thing I really wanted to deal with, but with my lastest surgery everything flared up again and I thought CRAP...enough is enough. I asked him his thoughts on Lynch Syndrome testing and he said with your family history the doctor that recommended it was wise (my onc). I'm not sure why but it made me feel better. Maybe it's that second opinion thing. I'm feeling good, have started going to the gym again and try to walk daily. I'm even giving up wine...God forbid... not forever I hope!!! Like I said...this year...is going to be a year of health not sickness. On a more fun note, my dh and I are planning a trip to Eastern Europe at the end of Sept early Oct. We decided to do a tour. The group we are going with is into teaching the history and culture of the sites visited with local guides assisting. It will be in the middle of my sabbatical which I've had approved for August, Sept & Oct. I'm so excited! I definitely need to get into shape, they walk from 2 - 8 miles some days and classify most days as strenuous.   I hope everyone is well. All the trips sound fun, sounds like lots of family visits and parties. Do you feel like me, it's nice that most of our lives are as not focused on bc but on life? Or is it just me. When the doctor asked me today what type of chemo I had, I couldn't recall the name of cytoxine. It made me feel good in a strange twisted way. Wishing you all a good week. Betsy",

It makes me feel better when I re-focus my thoughts to the \"now\". Have you thought about having a \"coming out party\"? It might make it easier..just get everyone drunk and no one will even notice that your \"topless\"...Hey..it's an idea! Helen...I can't imagine not having the support of my family through this regardless of my decision. I hope you get \"new improved girls\" when your ready. Just think..you can choose your new look. Do you have to go through a skin stretching process like the one Dawn described in prior posts? Judy - is your stomach back to normal yet? Occasionally...I get heartburn but nothing like the chemo burn. I hope your GI tract is healing. TSmith- I'm happy you are done with chemo. I hope you are the last straggler...now we can all celebrate!!!!",

I've had so many compliments this past week on my hair, I may decide to keep it super short. It's so easy. Funny...I always thought guys liked long hair. It's mostly guys that have said how much they like it???? Even my med onc said \"wow...your hair looks sheik\". I don't see what they see, I still think it's WAY too short. So my first follow up meeting with my onc. was pretty uneventful. The only new news is I ok'd starting tracking tumor markers. Is anyone else doing this? It's a blood test that tracks hormones and proteins that can elevate if there is cancer activity. You all probably already know about this but it was news to me. Anyway, I started it yesterday. The only thing I have to remember is that there seems to be a lot of false positives and they don't even get excited until you have elevated levels for a couple of months.Oh the other thing...my WBC is still low. My onc was not worried he said it was most likely from the chemo rads combination. My first rad onc meeting also happened yesterday. Got felt up twice..my poor little boob was quite sore but the rads onc was much gentler than my med onc. He said I still had edema from rads but everything looks great. Titan.. No spiky boots for me..but I bought some funky flats with patent leather buckle snaps/brushed leather uppers. Not quite like Doc Martins but along the same lines of funk factor but dresser. I wore them to work today with a scarf!  Judy - don't be nervous about your hair. You will look marvelous!",

It takes a trend upward before they start worrying about it. I'm happy you have made a decision for yourself to have surgery. I know it's been a struggle for you. Thanks for all the info. on N.E., we hope figure out our itinerary this weekend. The dr. said I would most likely always struggle with the edema. But if it's like my arm, it has slowly improved a bit making it much more manageable. So I'm very hopeful. I know it takes patience which is NOT one of my strengths. We are hoping to take the European trip in 2013 or 2014. Right now, it's one day at a time. I got my packet of lab instructions for my next round of genetic testing from the Cleveland Clinic this week. This time they are testing me for Cowden Syndrome. I think they just want to prove the tamox. did not cause my endo. cancer. They want four vials of blood, I laughed and said...oh sure when I spoke with the intake researcher. Then she said they would take what they could get. They will be lucky if they can get one vial. I'm very stingy with my blood these days. Helen...how are you doing? Have you heard back from your doctor? Geri and Amy- hope all is well with you. Amy are you leaving on your trip soon? Titan...my favorite NUT... I hope all is well with you. The Ducks lost a number of their senior players this year so I think it's going to be a rebuilding year. Two new QB's and I know for sure one new guard. Have a great weekend. Betsy",

Actually I refused it, even though it was made to order. The women I worked with said it would be expensive, I asked, what's expensive? She said about $500-$600 dollars. I said OUCH but ok'd it since I knew I needed it....then when it came in they asked me to sign a receipt for $1275, I said no. I ordered a $500 item, not a $1200 item. So I went home and just got super depressed. The owner of the store called me on Monday. We negotiated, I will pay up to $600 if the insurance doesn't pay, she will write off the balance. It's a racket, I swear! Anywoo...there is a very good ending to the story. I am pleased to annouce, it works wonderful. The first night I wore it my leg was almost normal in size when I woke up, an even better it didn't ache! Day two my leg was normal size. I walked a lot this weekend and my leg hardly swelled up. It's a miracle item. It's not pretty but its effective. My dh describes it like an oven mitt in the shape of a walking cast. It covers my foot up to my knee. Titan...I looked on a map cause I don't know the east coast worth squat...Hilton Head looks very far from Boston. Too bad you couldn't switch directions and go to the Maine coast instead of SC. We are starting off in MA, then VT, NH and ending in Maine. I'm really looking forward to it now that I have some relief for my leg. I agree with the rest of you this entire experience has changed us. I look at life differently now. For one thing we as women are stronger now from going through what we have. Life is short...we need to take every opportunity to be happy. It's getting late. Hope you all have a good week. Betsy",

Judy- I read an article in yesterday's paper about cancer and fatigue. A quote from Dr. Patricia Ganz, a professor at UCLA School of Medicine. \" We are not entirely sure, but it may be due to unchecked inflammation in the body.\" Treatment could possibly push the immune system into overdrive, and in certain patients, the resulting inflammation could increase fatigue \"as if the body were constantly fighting off a bad flu\".  I thought this article was interesting. It was on Cancer in America \"Living After Cancer\" by Judith Newman. Titan - I have my pap every year in January and now that I'm on tamox, it's mandatory.",

I hope your aunt doesn't have to go through chemo. It sounds positive with her being ER+/PR+ and Her2-.",

Sending you a big {{HUG}}. I'm not sure how I would be doing if I had to re-live last year's experience so soon. It's hard to go through it but also hard to witness it and be supportive. Especially, when you are still feeling beaten down by your own experience and other losses. {{HUG}} Judy - glad to hear you had so much fun. I hope your next trip is just as much fun. I think I agree with you it's just left over pain from the initial leg cramp but it's been almost two weeks. It seems like it should be getting better and it's not. Oh well...it's not keeping me down so I have nothing to complain about other than it messes with my sleep. I wake up hurting and can't get comfortable.  How's everyone else doing?",

I know I need to buck up...but I think with all that's been going on it will just have to wait a few weeks. Lena- I think our move it date is Sept. 20th but before then we have to move out of our dining room and entry because they are refinishing our floors. So just one more move out, then we get to move back in. I can totally relate to your packing comments, you happen to be moving much farther than I am but more than one half of our house is in boxes right now scattered all over. I just seem to be moving from room to room. Anyhow...it will all be over soon and the countertops look gorgeous. I'm really looking forward to cooking in my own kitchen again. I went to PT yesterday. My therapist said yes my breast is swollen again and wants me to see the surgeon. I just can't mentally do it right now. I have an appointment scheduled for Oct. and think that's good enough. I will not go back on antibiotic again as they just messed with my digestive tract. If it flares too much I will call. I'm trying to be good, doing my lymph massage 2x a day and wearing my Jovi at night. I even wore my mini jovi today under my work clothes. I will continue to be good (no salt and exercise daily), if in a week it doesn't improve I'll call. I'm just sick of this...and frustrated that this may just be how it is for the rest of my life. Sorry, I guess I'm feeling a little bitchy tonight. Titan - you are right, last year at this time we getting our tattoos and nervous about rads. I'm not sure I would have done rads if I would have known the SE's. Of course, I guess I just pulled the short straw because it sounds like most everyone else has not had any lasting SE's. Geri - Congrats on being deported!  Pam - Welcome back. I think cancer has reshaped all of our lives. Clearer priorities, cherishing our families, happy to be somewhat healthy again. It has also reshaped our bodies, not necessarily for the better. It is a process and we are still living it day in and day out. Those around us think it's over and done...time to move on. Well it's not that easy when every two months there is another dr. appt or more lab work, aches and pains from the drugs we are on, or SE's from tx. I think it's natural that there is a disconnect between those who have experienced cancer and those that have not. Well it's late and I need my beauty sleep. Sending Geri and Alaina healing thoughts.",

We should have fun with this.   Titan - sorry to read about your DD and the tornado...Geesh...here I had you enjoying Buckeyes with your DH, not freak'n out over your DD. I will keep her in my prayers. Geri - Give yourself time to adjust to working again. It takes more energy than you think. Take care. Judy - I hope you aren't burning the candle at both ends. You always sound so busy. Amy & Lena- I wish I could say I was being good about losing weight. At least I haven't gained but I've been so busy with the remodel that my workout time was eliminated. Now I have no excuse...so it's back to square one with me. Reduce calories and start exercising. Wishing you all a good week. Betsy ",

We just returned from a trip to the Redwoods in northern CA. Those trees are just AMAZING they are gigantic. We went down the southern Oregon coast (rugged and beautiful) and stayed in Cresent City, CA for two days. Then came back up through central Oregon. We stayed at the Oregon Caves...I didn't think I would like walking into a mountain that has had a history of earthquakes...but it was really cool. We stayed at an old lodge there, it was suppose to be haunted. I didn't sleep well but I think it wasn't the ghost, it was hormones. Anyway, we had a wonderful time on our trip home. Stopped by several vineyards up the Willamette Valley. Lena...warning...moving in is harder than packing up. Packing you don't have to think, moving back in is cleaning and thinking. My brain had trouble, I think I've moved my spices at least three times and now I think they need to be moved back to the first location. OMG...LOL. But...I do love my kitchen. You are all welcome to stay if you ever make it to Oregon. My house will be called R&B's B&B. Surely it must be on someone's bucket list. I now have a good five day road trip to share too.   Monday I head back to work after a two week vacation. I'm not ready but this kitchen remodel ended up costing way more than we anticipated so damn...guess it's back to the grind stone. Hope everyone is doing well and the rains/flooding haven't impacted you. Betsy",

She actually thinks my compression garments may be inhibiting my natural drainage.  Any hoo...I can finally wear my old bra's again, so that's a plus.  I realized when I was talking to her that I had been doing everything right, except for keeping my stress levels manageable. So when I went home, I had a frank discussion with my dh, about what the source of my stress WORK, he was totally supportive, which of course made me feel even worse. It took him a while to settle me down, I was shocked at the intensity of my feelings. It pretty easy to see when my stress increases, so does the size of my breast. It's so frustrating, I just want to scream. Plus, I just can't multi-task anymore and that's one of the main aspects of my job Sometimes I feel so stupid.. I just don't feel like I can do it anymore. If I can just hang in there for one more year I get a three month sabbatical, is it worth it? I can retire with full benefits in 4 years. I am so torn. Do I push forward or say screw it and take care of my body right now. I guess the best possible solution is to reduce my stress but keep on working. Bottom-line, I guess I need to speak with my boss (who happens to be wonderful) and just see if I have any options.  I'm feeling very bummed about it. I'm glad to be taking the next week off on vacation. Maybe it will give me time to sort through my feelings. I hope everyone is doing ok. Sorry to unload on you all but I know you are a safe outlet.

I have my evaluation on Monday with an LE specialist. My path here was slightly different than your's. In mid Dec all of a sudden, post rads, my breast swelled, it was hot to the touch and hurt...sort of a burning pain and I felt tightness in the axilla area plus my arm mobility decreased. I went to my rads onc...he put me on antibiotics for an infection. After my first round ended, he referred me to my bc surgical onc. So I put a call into her...but she was on vac (over the holidays) so I saw another dr. She put me back on antibiotics and said definitely an infection. She did an ultrasound and opted not to take a tissue sample as she was worried about more potential infection. After my third round of antibiotics I finally saw my surgeon. She didn't say much, just looked at me and started me on a treatment plan for early stage radiation induced fibrosis, 800 iu Vit E and 2 trental per day for six months or more. Before my last round antibiotics I went in for a BSGI test and they finally decided to do a biopsy. Apparently there is no infection and they are now referring me to a LE specialist. The biopsy did indicate fibrosis and tissue damage. I haven't gotten the \"official\" report on the lab work yet. My BSGI was \"non-conclusive\"...lots of hot spots so a major change from my original scan. I'm just curious...what they do for truncal LE? Also did they say anything about hot tubs? Through this entire process I have been banned from my brand new HT. It's ironic...after years of wanting a tub, I finally treated myself to this purchase - thanks to a forgotten cancer insurance policy, now have one and can't use it. It's a total bummer.",

I wish I would have read your post before I went cold turkey. Maybe easing into it might have worked better. Oh well...I still think I'm going to try the acupuncturist. My LE therapist gave me two names, one Chinese and the other a N.D., MSOM, LAc., R.D. She told me absolutely do NOT go to anyone my friends recommend. Both practitioners have experience with LE. Her perspective is it will help my stress levels besides opening the channels. Stress happens to be one of my triggers. WhatRstatsanyway - Before I went to my LE therapist I spoke with my surgeon, who gave me the recommendation. I was also being seen for radiation induced fibrosis. I watched the video clip Kira posted but the technique is different for everyone. I do not have LE in my arm only my chest.  I would highly recommend going to a LE therapist, even if it's a 10 hour drive. It's well worth it. If you have someone that can come with you, that would even be better. They give you a lot of information to digest and sometimes having two sets of ears is better. If that doesn't work, bring a tape recorder so you can listen to what was said later. Good luck to you and know that you are not alone in this.",

They put me on Vit D and calcium prior to rads due to osteopenia. He said those were fine. He added, I could take a multivitamin if I wanted. Also, I'm curious as to how everyone's blood work has been going? Are your WBC & RBC being affected? I haven't had any blood work since a month out from chemo and I was still very low back then. Actually, they were both lower than when they threatened me with hospitalization (WBC 1900). I guess it wasn't as problematic at the time because I was done with chemo, so they figured my body would begin repairing itself. I just curious because of ccbaby's last post. I do feel like my RBC has improved, I can now walk up an incline without having to stop to take a breath.",

My boost has my nipple in the target zone and it has gotten more and more tender and has a couple of black spots on it.

Wow...I guess I had a chemo moment. You looked awesome! I think you pulled it off way better than I did. Sorry to hear you are experiencing such fatigue. Sounds like others are experiencing it too... Just got back from my onc appointment. He gave me a choice to start Tamoxifen right now or wait until I finish with rads. I'm leaning toward starting it right away. What have others done? For those of you that had a lumpectomy...are you wearing bras through rads? Thanks for any input. Have a great weekend. Betsy",
