I too had monitored sedation for an unrelated outpatient procedure last year, and afterwards, the nurses teased me about the talking I had done while undergoing the surgery. Fortunately, I hadn't said anything embarrassing, just talk about work and such. I've also heard similar stories from other women who didn't seem to mind much. However, I'm a private person by nature and the thought of not being in control of my talking frightens me, especially since there is a good chance of having people who know me (apart from medically) in the operating room. Also, because of a past very painful stereotactic biopsy, I\"m afraid that by the time the wire localization is over I\"ll be so nervous that general anesthesia would be best. I'm quite a sack of worries right now, but it is my nature. Has anyone out there faced the same fears? I know there is a lot more to be afraid of than this, so feel weird even asking..",
