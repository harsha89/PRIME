He was in a hurry so I didn't have a chance to ask if that was a mistake or if it's a change in standard of care for followups. I always ask a list of questions which I had no idea was bothersome until I requested patient notes and saw the recurring note was in the vein \"again with the questions\" or \"page of questions\". so maybe it's a reduced schedule for that reason",
