However, in the past year, I have not been able to do this. The area has been growing slowly. The past couple of days, it has become very painful and today it is red all around the area. My mom had breast cancer-hormone receptive, extremely aggressive-and I have been on hormone replacement therapy for 7 years. I am very concerned. I saw a ob-gyn few months back just for exam since I had not had one in 7 years. I did ask him about the area, he was not concerned and said to \"keep mashing on it\". I did not do this because nothing would come out anymore and it hurt to do this. Do you think it could be cancer? Log in to post a reply",
