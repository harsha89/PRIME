Was sweating tonight after chemo this afternoon. Starting drinking glasses of water per recommendations from all of you in this group. THANK YOU...sweat is gone, body temperature is self-regulating. Haircut was successful and sooooo funny! My daughter cried and laughed; son said I looked like a supermodel! I am thankful to be among you. Such gorgeous women, with humor and pizzazz even as we trek through chemo. ",

I want you to save your money to take good care of yourselves and to thrive. You have already given back multiple times over, as women, mothers, sisters, caretakers, caregivers, friends, grandmothers, professionals, homemakers, on this discussion board, as breast cancer fighters, and in ways that no one else may understand. I am proud to simply be among such an amazing group of women, who have transformed my experience with this cancer. The last little girl is my friend's kid...and he put this video together....i should tell you about him. When he was around 14, he left a good bye message on my voicemail (i ran a youth center for high risk kids) and I drove to his house, banged down his door and dragged him out of bed (on a school day). He had overdosed. He was okay. I reconnected with him right before being diagnosed and he has been wonderful to have in our lives. Yeah for friends that follow-through...new and old. PLEASE WATCH this YouTube link about our family and SHARE https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVNd3BpBxGo&app May 26, 2015: I am at Massachusetts General hospital in Boston thinking that we have been through a lot as a family; especially in the last 18 months.

Allicat - congrats on your son's graduation. The concept of concentration camp survivor- I thought I would look like that as well. Addie - welcome. I hope things continue to go well with chemo treatments. Everyone is so different with SE Lemonade - hang in there. Was thinking about you the other day but so exhausted to check in. slv - that was a long time to wait. love seeing pics of where people are and how everyone looks ksusan - so very wonderful is your pic. I took medical leave from faculty teaching this semester but despite so, I got the university wide teaching award! I can't even seem to celebrate that but perhaps I will later on. Somewhat bitter-sweet. Littleblue - hope that mouth thrush clears up soon. Alibeths - know the feeling of not wanting to go to chemo. I have #4 on May 26 and then I begin tamoxifen. ankledolphi\u2026 - I also had #3 this past week. So glad to have folks on the same schedule - it's feels less isolated. Lovlilynne - I wonder if your former supervisor has BC - is that what you were thinking? It is a small world and I find more people I know with BC now than I did before. Everyone else - here's to all of you!! Take care this weekend, be gentle with yourselves, and maybe buy yourselves a treat. Now that I said that, I might actually do that for myself. I am happy with my scarves and hats right now. My bald head is getting really bald. But the fatigue is what really had me down this week. Cheers.",

Sometimes, I reach for a brush and then remember but something is sprouting on my bald top. My kids also let me know that I have a dent. :) Andrea - I love that your friends came out to help with the garden. Gingeel - Love your attitude in pushing through chemo and living life! Gingerchi - thinking about you and hoping your recovery after the hospital stay is going well. Rpayton - I agree with your recommendation of yoga, meditation, etc...it helps keep me in the present moment. Ksusan - good luck with radiation Stephmoen - hope all your treatments go smoothly I missed many of you and I wish you well. I am on tamoxin, fighting through depression, trying to transition back to one day a week at work, sad about one of my closest friends who did not know how to be there for me. And then I look at my two lovely kids who do know how to love me, and my husband, who gazes with worry, and my mother, who just got called in for a second mammo (they think it's a cyst)...and I know that I am loved more that I ever thought I would be. Tomorrow, I booked a hotel in Mystic, CT and got library passes for the aquarium. I will send you all pictures of a beluga whale!!! :) I am determined to find a way to beat the anxiety and depression crap that comes with cancer. And July 3rd is our 16th wedding anniversary!

Those wild flowers in your beautiful part of the country are waiting for us trek through them next year. You are stronger and more powerful than you think possible.

I hope the SE subside for you. Wishing mightily from Massachusetts. Everyone else, you are in my thoughts daily and I am hoping that treatments go as well as possible with manageable SE (wishing hard for this). I had my last chemo yesterday and I love my nurse more than my MO. My kids were super happy. I am not there yet...I wonder how effective it all was, but I feel the cancer cells being knocked dead! heh! And I am ready to tackle whatever comes next with fewer expectations that I had before BC but with a stronger determination, more balance, and some powerful feeling within me (I get that from your contagious posts). In the next post I will share my video about giving forward. My very good, talented friend managed to beat his alcoholism (sometimes I think he is worse off than I am; he is only 30; my husband rolls his eyes) and pull this video together before my last chemo. hugs your way!",

It's a chronic disease and we will hold it at bay!🌈 I put my feet on ice for 15-20m every evening to deal with the sore, dancing red feet syndrome. I also have random dark spots appearing on my feet and palms, darkening nail beds. I think I am going to join KSusan for her walk on the beach...sounds like fabulous feedback will come of it!

This is really hard, all of it and you are reacting normally to trauma. Having breast cancer, cancer, going through treatment is traumatic. I know exercise helps me, as well as hydrating, but I also see a therapist because I know I can't handle it all right now. I also am on atavan which reduces anxiety and is prescribed by my oncologist. Mindful practices, such as yoga and deep breathing, have been a life saver and this was not something I did before cancer. Talk it out with us as well...sending you a big hug!",

Anyone else with this kind of experience. It's a light period and some spotting in between. Last AC, my MO told me that I was anemic (a little below the threshold) and that it was normal during chemo. Should I be worried? I have been going protein heavy this week to get ready for chemo #4. I also have an anal fissure (crap!!!) and it's so painful. Heals slowly with AC. Can't really do much until chemo is over and then I am scheduled for a colonoscopy in a month (my MO said that was sufficient time post chemo). I hate all this stuff and the ongoing saga of what's next. Okay...now I am in serious whining mode. My son had a fever on Sunday morning, my daughter has an infection related to her earring (got her checked by dr. today), my husband hurt his foot somehow, a once-dear friend of mine is clueless, and i have chemo tomorrow...and I met my stupid, unsupportive Department Head while filling up on gas. I cried so hard in the shower....just want to sob it all out and release those stress hormones. Not fair!! I don't feel one bit positive right now.",

I learned that I might be experiencing grief instead. WOW! It has been hard for me to comes to terms with the fact that some people that I have LOVED so much (my sister and one of my best friends) aren't able to be there for me in the way I am for them. And I also learned that some of the other women finishing treatment (chemo or radiation) are finding that they need some alone time. I am feeling that too. My mum does a lot for us and I love her, bupt I need some space from her so that I can take on some of these responsibilities or let the house become messy. So I suggested that she take some time to travel to visit a good friend and then head to my brother's place to help with his son's bar mitzvah.

Hi everyone, I am sending you all warm wishes on this beautiful New England summer night (think cool night, clear sky, frog sounds (Yes, Littleblue), quiet). Sigh. Today I went to see the Lymphedema PT who provide me with such great information. I will see her in 2 weeks after I have gone to restorative yoga. I learnt so much but only retained 25% due to chemobrain. I told her I would need 2 more visits to retain more info about exercises. So...compression sleeves should be covered by insurance. Will look into that as we fly to Chicago for a family gathering in Sept. Yesterday, I saw my MO's team. Was told to get off tamoxifen for 2 weeks to see if depression lifts. Lo and behold, no major depressive symptoms today. Maybe it's all in my head but those mood swings from tamoxifen...i don't know. I feel more like myself than I have felt in 3 weeks since going on Tamox. And my hair...well it's not growing back yet and I am still very bald some 6 weeks after chemo. I think I am a slow hair grower person whatever....",

Your experiences have helped positively shape how I think about cancer. Wishing the best to those going in for treatment next week! I am premenopausal and one of my MOs suggested NO Lupron while the other MO said YES Lupron to stop ovaries from producing estrogen. yes...I have two MOs...one is a backup in case I don't like what the other one says. They communicate with each other as well. :) I am scheduled for a Lupron shot on Tues but leaning towards no Lupron. I think my body has been through a lot with 2 surgeries, reconstruction and chemo. Not sure what I will end up choosing.",

Scarlett152 - thinking about your post. My MO told me that plantar fasciitis sometimes worsens with chemo. Sounds like that with heel/ball of heel pain and walking. I have this as well and it got worse through and after chemo. I am doing joint exercises with a PT/Lymphedema person. WHO, I must say this, seems to have healed some the cording that I got under my breast scar. She massaged it and I swear it doesn't hurt anymore. I am in awe. Mondor's cords. Andrea is FAMOUS, y'all!!! Littleblue - the food issues. It will get better and eating healthy is the right way to go for cancer/general health. Whine loudly! If I was there, I would walk out to some mountains with you and wail away. If I did it here, I would get arrested (dementia, they would say....or she finally broke down or she gangsta with that low cut hair). And beach time, Lynne. YES - we went to Cape Cod on Monday...beautiful! Kids finally got to the beach. A question about scans: I was told no scans or mammos (I had a BMX). Is it worth pushing for a PET scan or MRI? Have a gentle weekend, beautiful people. ",

I went in for my first chemo session for TC (docetaxel/cyclophosphamide) . The scheduler was pretty horrible and I decided that I would book everything through my MO and nurse practitioner instead. My nurse at the infusion center was Kathy...oh so skilled and phenomenal. LOVE the woman.  An hour later my regiment was changed to AC and I got the doxorubicin adjuvant therapy. That went fine. My day began at 7am and ended at 11pm. Today I feel fine and managed to walk with ease around the block. I look forward to picking up the kids!! I want to let folks know that if you do have as severe a reaction, the team is really equipped to handle it. And I felt fine within a few minutes and was walking around with ease an hour after the reaction. I am grateful for today, to have been at MGH in Boston, and that at the end of this chemo will get my body to a better place in dealing with cancer. Thankful for the little things. GIngerchi...how did it go?",

No evidence of disease. I had my 3 month followup. I asked for thyroid and vit D to be added ...I actually demanded it. Glad I did. Good news is that the small lump did not appear to raise concerns upon imaging. The bump on my head (which in my mind was a brain tumor that had broken through the skull and was seeking air) has diminished to a tiny bump. My labs - I am not anemic anymore. BUT I have hypothyroidism, which I did not have pre-diagnosis and my vit D levels are low. So I have to have thyroid replacement meds and a megaboost of vitamin D added for the next 6 weeks. UGH..autoimmune disease. Worse still, work is being an ass over medical leave and I hope it all works out so that I can go back at 50% time. Otherwise, it's full speed ahead and picking up 2 courses to teach in the third week of the semester. ARGGGHhhhhh!! I am in a foul mood for sure.",

I have set up 6-7 people to rotate through in taking kids to swim class, getting them through weekend, feed them, and be with them until DH comes home from work at 9:30pm at night. Never done this before and am rarely away from kids (except for short conferences). Nervous. Argh... but this retreat is for healing. It's a gift to myself. I already had some awful \"pink October\" moments - requests for donations, pink ribbons, sigh... My 10 year son told me that he wants me to do what is good for me.

I am curious as I go in for my second infusion. Learning other people's experiences with SE has helped me tremendously. ksusan - I think you mentioned the bio-oil, but maybe someone else did. I just started using it today and am also using it on my son's scar from a fall. Looking forward to results. You had several great suggestions - thank you so much. Lovilynne - hang in there!! I am glad you came to this group to express your frustration. We get it! I sent out the gift for your daughters ...hope they like it. A bit of a random thing to do :) And the thread about claritin!!!!! Thank you...I was told the same thing, did not understand the who SE thing and experienced bone pain after my first infusion. I started claritin yesterday. I am prepping for my second AC infusion on Monday, April 27. My first one was scary due to to the anaphalactic reaction to Taxotere, so I have some remnant anxiety. I have a kid question: my son (10yrs) is experiencing a lot of fear of death (I think trauma). Unfortunately, the school is talking about bullying right now (and extreme cases), a 4th grade assigned reading involves a kid who drowned, etc... I have been practicing mindful techniques with him, like deep breathing, focusing on the reality that it's a book or it's not happening now, etc. I know this is related to my cancer, and he acknowledges that. It gets worse right before I go in for chemo. My daughter (7 yrs) just gets angry (few days leading up to my chemo). Anyone else have some thoughts about how we (DH and I) can help our kids? We will see the child psychiatry team at MGH/Boston on Monday and meet w/ guidance counselor and his teacher. Thanks. Wishing everyone the least SE this week!",

I'm going through the first diagnosis but thinking about recurrence as well. The child psychiatrist at MGH/Boston probably taught us the most important things: 1. BC and all cancers are a chronic disease, 2. treatment has improved in major ways in the past 5 years and will improve even more in 5 more years, so we will be able to manage this disease.

He is 30, I am 44 and we have known each other for 16 years. Our kids are the same age. So we were thinking that why go bald without a blast. We are going to video tape it, with our kids cutting our hair. And we are going to raise funds for a variety of charities, a low income woman that I know is struggling with cancer, and my daughter's classmate who lost her father to suicide. Two of my bald male friends will join us for some humor and have the kids paint the Breast cancer ribbon on their shiny spots. DH wants to go bald too, but we thought it might be too much for the kids. And if we pull it off, we may raise some good amount of funds for charities that do great work in the world - Calcutta Kids, Inc works with pregnant women in the slums of India, Energia Fitness will help raise funds to provide cancer survivors and patients with personal training, CMAA a small non-profit in Lowell, MA works with the Cambodian refugee population. I am so excited about the idea. We're scheduled for this Sunday. I can pull clumps out of my head, so I am hoping there is hair left to shave by Sunday.

Yes, your lady parts are beeeaauuutiful! If DH hasn't seen them lately, he is missing some valuable time! So....I went to a hip hop class last night. Trying to push myself to do different things. It was ok .. Ended up feeling like aerobics...but next week I will try another class in another town. And I applied for a fellowship that will train me in a medical center and GOT it. It buys me some time to think about career and life post cancer. What do I really want to do? Ok y'all... Take good care, lady parts and all. Exercise!!! Eat healthy!!! Breathe!! We came through one hell of year, and we're going to really make the most of the coming year. ",

I like to be on my guard since BC came out from nowhere and knocked me flat on my behind - I don't trust those cells! I would like to be proactive - can I ask how often check-ups were post chemo for you the first time around? How can I be proactive moving forward through treatment? I am almost done with chemo (AC) and then begin tamoxifen. I had a BMX, Oncotype of 20, decided to be aggressive and am getting AC chemo for 4 sessions, and then tamoxifen. I will ask my MO whether they tested all of my tumors for the Oncotype DX. ",

And there is some energy in everyone's posts - we are all just amazing given what we have been through. Stephmoen - I had extensive DCIS and 5 small idc tumours, which they think was one tumour. Awww...thanks to those talking about the transition from chemo onward. My emotional state is all over and I do feel like bawling at least 2x a day. The rest of the day seems okay and I am able to find many happy spots...cardinals, blueberries, walking, eating chocolate, HUGGING the kids, etc. but when the blues hit...wow! I am looking forward to living, too, but I am scared because I have to have a colonoscopy for blood in my stool next month. And my mom has both a mammo and a colonoscopy scheduled soon. Ok...now I am bawling! It is too much, isn't it. Sigh...and Yet i look forward to my gentle dance class at the cancer connection. Got to pick myself up. HEY..just posting that a minute ago helped already. Thanks for this discussion group!!!!",

Alibeth - great t-shirt! Love the design. My 10yo will not allow me to wear it... :) Rpayton - Happy birthday to your husband. 50 is a great achievement in my books. Raisemeup - be gentle with yourself; your body has been through a lot. Hope you get your energy back and feel better. Sending you positive thoughts. Lovilynne - Hope you have few side effects. Glad that you are getting a break from work and looking forward to vacation. Since my dad died, my mom lives with us and so we are very, very lucky! She is my rock and I take her to all my dance classes with my cancer buddies. We rock it and they are always in awe of this 4' 11'' 76yo woman bouncing around the room. Fun times with this little lady and my kids cannot do without her. Went dancing at the cancer connection today I got to dance, meditate, cry (again), and reflect. Love the women there - they have such soul and have suffered from all types of cancer. Going to MO visit, bloodwork, echo, and luprene next week. Wishing all those in the chair few SE and sending you my strength.",

I met some women who were struggling with similar issues with their DH. One woman said that her husband miss d the old her, and she told him that the game had changed and the old her was not coming back.

It gave me some ideas for working with my son's whole classroom to make the school year better for him. :) Last night, yes...it started...hair began to fall out! I cried in the shower. Crap..I don't like this journey. My DH was sad for me too, so we watched a movie together. Today my 7 year old daughter will experiment with her professional haircut on me. She has 5 choices drawn out including: bow haircut, vampire haircut, boycut, curly cut. So funny! What should I choose???? My son (10) will do the buzz cut in a couple of days when things begin to look patchy. So strange to grab hair and find it in my hand. A long distance friend wanted to skype because he misses me - I told him that it would be emotionally difficult next week, If he missed me/our family that much, he could figure out a way to come and see us. GingerChi - I am ready for tomorrow at this minute. That might change in a few more minutes. Allicat and slv58 - lovely to hear about your daugthers. Allicat, i love the progressive pics. My older sister won't come to be my chemo buddy because she has so much going on (right?), but my older brother is coming for several days (yeah!) Littleblueflower - Take an amazing drive with your pathfinder. Powerful SUV! :) I hope this week brings some peace and lots of self-care to all of you. Hang in there!

I joined the LIVESTRONG at the Y program and love it. Yeah. I am back on tamoxifen as of yesterday and praying antidepressants mitigate the mood swings I had in June. I am transitioning back to work. good sex is possible - just saying. A few months beyond chemo, and when not on tamoxifen, we rocked the house! Well, not really but at least we rocked a little even if we did not begin an earthquake. AND THEN I got a UTI! God help me! There is Hair growing on this forum. I see spikes of hair. Remember back in May...what hair? And I am going for the BC retreat in OCT... Now, who is going to watch my kids? I have to plan this really well",
