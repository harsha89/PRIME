I am 27 y/o and have very dense breasts (not necessarily due to God's grace as it is to the delicious foods he helped us create lol) and cannot feel any lumps or bumps. I have had pain in my breasts here and there but neverreally paid much attention to it (don't usually get period due to birth control). After calling 2x a week since the day I saw the dimple I finally got into my Dr last week, she came into the room and asked me what the problem was...I assumed the position and from across the room (about 4-5 ft away) she could see the dimple. Due to my age they have ordered a breast u/s, and I think it is only of the affected breast. If they find nothing on this U/S should I leave it at that or should I also ask for a mammo or something else? I am going in tomorrow morning and would like to know what I should ask for etc before I go there. My grandmother had breast cancer (not hereditary) before she died (not of the cancer though). Also I have been exposed to a lot of radiation (Graves disease so I had a radioactive uptake and scan along with a radioactive Idonine abalation, not to mention normal xrays etc).
