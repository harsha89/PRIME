I have not been doing well myself.  I have been so weak with chemo induced anemia that I can barely make it from one room to the next.  Low hemoglobin has forced 2 transfusions, (2 pints each time).  First one lasted less than 3 weeks before the count was in the toilet again.   This one brought it back up significantly, so I am hopeful that it will last longer.  I feel much stronger this time.  I still have 10 Taxol treatments to go.  My last one on Thursday was not done because now my WBC was too low.  UGH!!!   They ordered neupogen for me to give myself shots for the 3 days following each treatment from now on.  I am also in a clinical trial for Avastin but only get that (or placebo) every 3rd treatment.   Luckily, I have not had too much in the line of other se's.  Not sure if I could handle much more.  I do have some back pain and shoulder pain, and oh God, I wish the feeling in my mouth would go away.  The only way to describe it is after you burn your mouth taking a sip of hot tea or coffee.  But it never goes away.   Anyone else have that? LisaLisa, I agree that it gets more difficult with each treatment.  We know it is the best thing for us but still don't want to go.  Now finding out I will have to go for another week is really frustrating.  You have had such a tough time with your infections and everything.  Keep your chin up.   You're almost there.   Here is hoping a good week for everyone and congrats to all who are finishing tx.    ",

I see a few a finished today.  It is getting hard to keep track now.   We should all be close to the end of the chemo.   YEAH for everyone!!!!!

I have my rads sim on 6/3.   Another MUGA and EKG because of the clinical trial on 5/28.   I haven't had energy to move, much less exercise through this entire 5 months of tx.   I am hoping  some of that energy returns during rads.   For some reason I woke up at 4 AM and can't go back to sleep.   I will try again in a bit.   Don't think it would be the steroid since I had that on Thursday morning.   Good night everyone.   You are all awesome and it is so good to know there are others out there to help us through this.    Lots of love to all the Jewels.  ",

I know not everyone experiences the same side effects, but it is good to know what is possible.  I read that soy products are not good for anyone on chemo.  My onco agreed.   There are some really good posts on here with lists of products that are good for us to have on hand in case.  I will try to find them and let you know where they are. Ask which drugs you will be getting and how many treatments of each.  In my case, I have to have radiation, so that will be done after the chemo.   Don't be afraid to ask all your questions.  You need to know everything.  When were you diagnosed?   I got mine on 10/15.  Modified radical mast with axillary dissection 11/11, port installed 12/11, first chemo 12/26.      Good luck on Tuesday.   ",

Ddlatt, thanks for the info on the red meat also.  Maybe I will try eating more from now on.   Gotta get back to work.   Thanks everyone for your posts and keep positive thoughts.  ",

My other younger son is visiting from New York this week and is cooking dinner.  Steak tonight so getting that protein in.  Going to try to rest.  Hope everyone is feeling better this evening.  Will catch up later.   Brenda",
