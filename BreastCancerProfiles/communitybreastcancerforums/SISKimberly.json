However, I feel caught... if I don\u2019t ask those who are dealing with it, then who do I ask? My oncologist hasn\u2019t had breast cancer, so how\u2019s he going to help me see the whole picture not just the statistics?  I certainly did not intend to suggest that any one who chose to respond to my question should look back and play the what if game or have regrets. As I stated in my last post and you have reiterated, no one knows what the future holds. Thank you for taking the time to let me know your story and for the encouragement to find my way. Badboob- I agree that oncologists may not always be as upfront about the risks so as not to panic their patients, but then it is up to each of us to be vigilent and to be our own advocates.  We certainly are all different in our types, stages, and treatments, and the fact is as you've pointed out, we all have cancer, which is not curable only manageable. My head understands the concept of wanting to do everything possible to get the upper hand, but my heart just hasn\u2019t made that leap yet. Little-G- That is the great debate! No one knows who these treatments, individually or in combination, will work for or not and why. It seems that there is a cast the net wide kind of mentality at play here.  If you cast the net wide enough, you\u2019re bound to get something\u2026in this case the positive result from treatment X, Y, or Z which makes it the treatment for everyone cause that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.

I want to be able to ask my oncologist to give me the specific reasons why, based on my path report and the things already done,why I'm being asked to do radiation in the face of the studies I read and the experience of women living it.   If he can convince me that radiation is the right thing for me based on my pathology, OK, but because I was told, even before my surgery and final path report, that I WOULD have radiation,which changed my reconstruction plans, I'm not so sure it's me the patient or the 'way we do it' that is being considered first and foremost.   How can that be a forgone conclusion without all of the information?  Thank you in advance for listening and contributing to this conversation.

I'm glad you are well now, and hope that you are able to put your recurrence into remission. Member- No apologies are needed for feeling passionate about this topic. I don't believe I actually stated \u2018they don't know what works', what I said was that when they get a positive result with a treatment, then that is what is given to all patients. If TAC works with this group with this dx, then they all get TAC. My point is that we are all so individualized, even those of us with the same dx, and that docs don't know if TAC will work for me or not with any certainty. Yes, there are tests out there to help individualize treatments more and more, but are they widely used or even offered? If I hadn't asked, and been turned down, it certainly wouldn't have been offered as an option.  Asking the group Movin' Beyond is a good idea. I'll do that.

I know my onc wants to be aggressive, and I know that he really wouldn\u2019t recommend something he felt was a waste of my time, but it just seems so counterintuitive to do an insurance policy treatment-radiation-that we all associate with causing cancer. Granted, it has to be high doses, but there\u2019s another question, how do they know how high is too high for each person?  If I have rads now, does that mean rads it out if I should get a recurrence because I\u2019ve met my rads quota so to speak?  My mind is spinning.

Another determination for me is that my cancer was on the left side, so my heart and lungs would have been affected and Adriamycin already put my heart at risk.  We all have to make choices for our own treatment, so get lots of information and then do what you feel in your gut is right for you.  Good luck, SIS (Sister in Survival) Kimbelry ",

The most many hear about breast cancer is during October, breast cancer awarenees month. People raise money, walk or run for the cause, everyone wears pink in solidarity, and not that I don't agree these things are so good for raising both awareness and funding, but where is the outcry...the rage that this disease, despite news women's treatment should be tailored-DUH!!!!!!, is still killing so many beautiful women? And why, are these tests, which are being used to prove their 'findings' going to be years away from being widely used...meaning thousands of women will be treated with drugs that will do nothing for them? LIke me, starting in January. As you said, this battle is waged one woman and one family at a time...it isn't an organized, in your face media blitz like Iraq or our politicians running for office....none of whom have mentioned this battle as a priority, I might add...not even John Edwards, whose wife is living with cancer. I just heard on NPR that a drug used to help patients with lymphoma, a drug that has a radioactive isotope attached and goes right after the cancer cells, is not being prescribed by many doctors because it required them to find a hospital that can handle radioactive material...which means they lose a patient and the income he/she brings. It is also costly $26,000, and medicare will only pay $16,000. So, it all comes down to money in the end it seems rather than to what really matters-our loved ones. I continue to hold both you and Diane close to my heart. Know you are in all our hearts, Bimmer. Kimberly",

I was good...I really was fine up to my visit with the surgeon last week. That made it really real for me. I am waiting for my breast MRI results, and I have to have an ultrasound needle guided auxillary node biopsy before I even get to schedule my surgery. My PET showed other issues in the breast, thus the MRI and the biopsy. Be kind to yourself. It will be a roller coaster ride of emotions.

The markers don't usually move, so I don't think this is causing the pain. With everything you're going through and the anxiety response your body is experiencing, it is most likely both the healing process and the fact you are so tensed up.  How long has it been since the biopsies? If it eases your mind, call your surgeon and ask if these 'pains' are normal for healing. Take a deep cleansing breath, Therese.  If you don't practice a relaxation technique, I would suggest you find one  that you like and practice it daily.  It's really helped me to get through times that are stress-filled or anxiety enducing.

My tool bar is back, and I didn't get any weird crypted programming stuff when I logged in and navigated from place to place. Man I was wiped out yesty.  I slept really hard, but did manage a good night sweat/freeze my booty off round. If it isn\u2019t one thing , it is another, but so much better than the alternative to not going through all of this. Kris- Glad you checked in to let us know how you\u2019re doing. I agree with your dh. Get healthy first, then worry about the weight. Glad you\u2019re able to get out and walk though, that is just good for the spirits even if it isn\u2019t at a cardiovascular workout pace.  We\u2019ll both be in the lounge together on the 22nd.  I have my last chemo that day.  From what I\u2019ve been reading, T is easier than AC, so let\u2019s hope that is the case for you. Therese- I hear ya on the loss of eyebrows. My left is more effected than the right at the moment, so I look like my face is crooked or something.  It\u2019s Christmas everyday, isn\u2019t it? Just never know what to expect. Ideas on raising your sibling triangle? Five years is a big gap, and I think one that will be beneficial since the older one is at a different stage of development than the twins. A little maturity is a good thing. Of course, there will be the period of time when the older one doesn\u2019t want to be followed around by the twins, but as they get older that will change. I don\u2019t know what the dynamics are with fraternal twins, but my sis and I were (and still are) each other\u2019s best friend, so we were never bored or without a playmate. When the older sib brushed us off, we had back up. In my family, there was less than 2 years difference, so we were all pretty much at the same stage of development over much of our lives.  There\u2019s no trick to raising these fabulous sibs\u2026just allow them to be who they are, give each one on one time, and love them through the rough times as I know you already do. Hooray on getting on that TM and for finding your cards and mailing them. Carol- OMG, you had me cracking up about loving your new fan and the waving of a magazine being annoying to others around you while watching TV.  What a sweetheart your dh is even if it benefits him and everyone else, too. And again, LOL on DWTS reference. Yep, I agree that her mug is not the attractive one it used to be, but I heard that she had complications and a botched procedure (duh, ya think) and is having a more reputable ps fix her up.  Hope that works for her. Oh, man I don\u2019t miss the hormonal mood swings of my ds\u2019s youth.  You certainly do have a good deal having another household to send him off to when he\u2019s being a moody monster (and I don\u2019t mean that he\u2019s being awful and mean, just that he\u2019s not his loving normal self.) By all means, print out my philosophy. I\u2019m glad it resonated with you. I totally know the \u2018pit\u2019 feeling and knowing you need to eat even if you\u2019re not hungry. I\u2019ve been doing more baths, too, but not right before bed. I can see how that would be very relaxing especially on top of your Lorazepam. Glad you slept well. Not sure I\u2019ll be drinking wine with the lasagne. I tried a little White Bordeaux with the salmon I fixed last night, and it was one of my favorite white wines. It tasted, OK. Don\u2019t think my taste buds are back. Most foods are just OK even though I know they are normally flavorful. Julie- Hey, decadron high was kicking in yesty huh? Wow, you got a lot done.  I too cooked for the first time in a while last night. I didn\u2019t do all that other stuff though. I haven\u2019t really cleaned my house in two months beyond surface stuff and even that has been sparse. I\u2019m thinking a maid service when I\u2019m done with chemo would be a good gift to myself.  A good one time deep cleaning. OMG, we have the same brow thing going on, too. It is weird looking isn\u2019t it?  I had baby fine thin, but a lot of it, hair before.  I\u2019d be OK with some curl, too. Sorry the ds is beating himself up, but that shows he\u2019s got a conscience and will definitely learn from this lesson. WhooHoo on the last infusion!!!!  I\u2019m right behind ya by only a few days.  May this one be light on the se\u2019s all around.  How great that your cousins are each taking turns to be with you today and tomorrow. Enjoy your girl bonding time. Kathy- How cute is that? The ds calling his preschool teachers \u2018his girls\u2019.  OK, I\u2019ve seen the J at the end of  people\u2019s emails and honestly don\u2019t know what that means in cyberspace. Can you clue me in? LOL on your weight loss imagery.  It isn\u2019t fair in the least is it? Hmmm, is that a new door opening? Sounds like the plusses outweigh the minuses from this end. You still get to pursue something new if continuing to do this is only part time when you want to be there (and the OM isn\u2019t); it keeps your NP current;it allows you to see your patients, and brings in a little extra moola\u2026sounds like a weiner to me.  Your boss obviously values you very much to be willing to do what it takes to keep you and to give you all the time you need to consider his offer. If he\u2019s grooming you to open this satellite office, how great would that be? Good luck pondering these new options. Well, looks like I\u2019m caught up for now. I\u2019ll try to check in after my antibiotic infusion. Sending out positive energy to all our Jewels. SIS Kimberly",

Hey Tina- How cool you being able to let us know how you\u2019re doing right from the lounge like a play by play from a sporting event. WhooHoo!!!!! You are done, girlfriend!!!!!! Heating and air conditioning is a good field to get into. Your ds#2 can make some really good money once he\u2019s got some experience under his belt.  We so need more young people to get into fields like that and car repair, especially now that there are so many computerized parts.

Sista- The shot is probably something like Procrit. Here\u2019s the article I found on it for anyone else who might be interested: New Studies on Anemia Drugs' RISKS - FDA FDA is reviewing new data from two studies that provide further evidence of the risks of anemia drugs known as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or ESAs. These two studies were not among the six described in the revised labeling that was approved by FDA on Nov. 8, 2007, which strengthened warnings about ESAs in cancer patients. All eight studies together show more rapid tumor growth or shortened survival for patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid or cervical cancers that received ESAs, compared to those patients who did not receive the treatment. \"FDA is reviewing these data and may take additional action,\" says Janet Woodcock, M.D., FDA's Deputy Commissioner for Scientific and Medical Programs, Chief Medical Officer, and Acting Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"In the meantime,\" she says, \"FDA recommends that health care providers review the risks and benefits of ESAs outlined in the product label and discuss this information with their patients.\" FDA plans to discuss this new data and revisit the risks and benefits of using ESAs in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia at a public advisory committee meeting in the next few months. What Are ESAs? ESAs are a bioengineered version of a natural protein made in the kidney that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells. FDA has approved the use of ESAs for treating anemia in patients with chronic kidney failure, cancer patients whose anemia is caused by chemotherapy, and those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) whose anemia is caused by the HIV drug AZT (zidovudine). ESAs are also approved to reduce the number of transfusions during and after major surgery. What Has FDA Done? FDA approved revised boxed warnings and other safety-related product labeling changes for ESAs in November and March 2007. Safety concerns regarding ESAs also have been discussed during advisory committee meetings in 2004 and 2007, and labeling was revised in 1997, 2004 and 2005 to reflect new safety information. For More Information FDA Press Release (January 3, 2008) www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01769.html FDA Public Health Advisory on ESAs (November 2007) www.fda.gov/cder/drug/advisory/RHE200711.htm I\u2019m sure your doctor wouldn\u2019t put you at risk unless your counts were just too low to do otherwise.  D1- Again, you\u2019re killing me with your wit. LOL on the accounting of your day with your I hate dieting and responsibility thoughts thrown in\u2026tequila and the Jewels are calorie free you know. I watch DWTS and Survivor.  I can\u2019t get into AI anymore, and some of those other shows are just not my cup of tea. I\u2019m so tickled that your college girl pulled a fast one and took care of her own internship\u2026they do grow up, don\u2019t they?  Another intelligent woman in politics is always a good thing. Maz- I am soooo sorry to hear about Val. I wish there was something I could do to help make this easier for you. Please let us know if we can do anything to support you as you go through this very difficult next phase of Val\u2019s journey.  I\u2019m glad that her partner and your other friend from Florida were there with you when you heard the news. Yep, cold sore for you know where that took forever to heal. I put stuff on it for cold sores\u2026medicated stuff the pharmacist recommended, which I can\u2019t recall the name of at this moment. Vit. B6 should help the twitching eye, I heard. Wvgirl and LWDana, kick cancer booty tomorrow\u2026just don\u2019t let the bouncers throw you out. Be stealth my friends. Catch you all tomorrow.  I have an early appt. so it may not be until the afternoon.  Off to turn the oven on so it\u2019s ready to heat the lasagne, which is on the way as I write.  Yummy.

Thought I was done yesty, but the nurse told me I still had one more. I have two areas on the right mound that are of concern. The skin is redder than what is around it and peeling like a sunburn. I\u2019m hoping it is because it was stretched beyond its desire and will settle down now that the skin is relaxing. I got a call from the radiologists office last Friday to make an appointment. I avoided doing it yesterday and told my dh I didn\u2019t want to even think about making another appt. right now.  I just want to bask in being done for a while, but he encouraged me to just get it done. He\u2019s totally behind me on just saying NO.  Sigh, guess I\u2019ll put that on my list of things to get done today. Julie- I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re feeling well and that the migrain headaches have cleared up. April showers bring May flowers as the old saying goes, maybe your spring is going to bring the most amazing carpet of flowers around you and your community this year. I call WalMart Wally World, too. Sometimes just getting lost in the aisles of a store is just what is needed. Of course, I totally understand the sudden feeling of, \u201cOK, gotta sit down now\u201d that can come over you these days. Glad you had a good day. That feeling of being a drift now that you\u2019re done\u2026D1 is right. Therese did express that exact feeling. I suspect we all will feel that feeling and as D1 pointed out, that is what we are going to be helping each other through next. Isn\u2019t it great that we have pioneers to lead the way. Those done with chemo and heading into rads will have those already in rads to get info from. Those heading into HT will have others who have already started ahead of them. Those facing being done will have those who have already faced the feeling of \u2018now what?\u2019.  We are so lucky to have found each other here, Jewels.   P.S. I love the little graphics you find, and OH YEAH, I second the Jason being HOT comment. Bet you won\u2019t be missing anymore DWTS episodes. Kathy- Although I appreciate that my words touched you, it pains me to think they have also caused you to \u201cfeel like I should not even bother to rant or open my \"mouth\" because you ALWAYS have the positive outlook\u201d. That was not my intention at all.  My response to the question was just my answer to the question we have all asked either out loud or within.  We all deserve to \u2018rant\u2019 and \u2018open our mouths\u2019 in order to live our truths.  It was not my intention to invalidate your feelings or those of anyone else.  BTW, loved the quote from Hitch and loved that movie. I may have to re-rent that one. Thanks for reminding me of the quote. WhooHoo on 1.5 miles on the TM and the new day outlook. This guy has been around awhile. He poses as women. He was  Sophia a while back. I got on many threads as others did to do just what AnnNYC did for us. Women on this site watch out for him and then warn others on the threads he\u2019s visited, which he bombards with his crap, and lets the moderators know he\u2019s back in order to get the posts removed. LWDana- I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve forgotten if you\u2019ve had a lumpectomy or mastectomy. That burning sensation is most likely nerves and stuff trying to heal, but I would certainly ask your plastic surgeon. As far as exercise, I was told only walking, too. However, some of our gals seem to have been able to go to the gym throughout. Oncologist\u2019s treatment preference, maybe? Just read Carol\u2019s post, man we think alike. D1- Thanks for getting your envelopes in the mail. I plan to send out Secret Pal names as soon as I get yours. What is with the weather in the east?  It is crazy that you guys are being tossed back and forth between winter and spring. This week, we had in the 80\u2019s yesterday, it is supposed to be in the 70\u2019s today, and then tomorrow in the 60\u2019s. Crazy.  Oh, I\u2019m not complaining as I know some of the gals would love to be in the 60\u2019s, but it\u2019s just such manic-depressive (aks Bipolar) weather we\u2019re all having. I am so glad to hear the dd\u2019s ankle is getting better and better.  So, can you believe that rads is almost done for you? How\u2019s Frankenboob doing? I am so glad to know you, too. Again, if it weren\u2019t for you starting this thread, this wonderful group of ladies would not have been. Of course, as I\u2019ve said before, the universe knew we had to be, and so we are. Thank you!!!!!! Sherry- I\u2019m so glad to hear your first rads went well and that you had a great time with your sis. Have you completely recovered from your allergies and all? Sounds like wedding plans and preparations are in full swing. How exciting. Have you gotten your dress yet? LOL on the eyelash story. Paula- OMG, that is sooo exciting and so well deserved!!!!! Please send us the link to your local paper so we can read it on Sunday. Congratulations!!!! Oh, just read Carol\u2019s post. Great minds think a like, eh? Thank you for the compliment regarding my imagery. P.S.  You are SO photogenic right now. Those pics from the chemo lounge are great. Paula, you are beautiful inside and out!!!! Carol- Well, I\u2019m so grateful for your words regarding my post. I guess I\u2019ve never been able to look at the other side\u2026read what I write and say, Wow, that was really inspirational or whatever. Writing has always been my way of expressing my thoughts and feelings as speaking to others has not always been my forte. My twinsis is awesome at that, and it is something I continue to work on\u2026being able to just talk to others by starting the conversation or continuing one they\u2019ve initiated. I\u2019m more of a listener. I\u2019m glad to hear your friend is going to try another type of chemo, but feel so badly that he has to experience the se\u2019s yet again. Well, you certainly have become the ambassador of bc in your area. I admire that about you, Carol. That is so awesome that you gave your friend the information about this site and have offered your number for support. BRAVO!!!! Tina- Well, like I said to D1, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the bipolar weather?\u201d  It is possible that pulling out the summer play toys too early has angered Ms. Nature. Now she\u2019s teaching you the be patient lesson, eh? As I said above, I too am just so ready for no appts for awhile. Therese- I can\u2019t wait to hear how your 5K went. I\u2019m so impressed with your doing that so soon after finishing tx, or maybe it\u2019s been longer than I think since your last tx. I love what you said about not living from test to Dr. appt. ect.  I too have found the same research about not doing scans as a routine for follow up and about false positives etc. I didn\u2019t know about the 4 month window from symptoms to being able to be found on a scan, however. Thanks for sharing your research with us. Wvgirl- Take care of your self. Get back to us when you can. Joan-I saw Robin Roberts the other day. She looks fab. I know that while in the fog, you answered a question I asked, but for the life of me I can\u2019t recall. I\u2019ll have to go back and find it. So, in advance, thank you. To those still drinking chemotini\u2019s I\u2019m thinking of you. To those getting tans at the salon, remember your sunglasses. Jenn, CathyCA, CarolC, CHJ haven't heard from you all in awhile. Hope all is well, and you're just on some wonderful 'cation somewhere. Oh, AZDeb, sorry I missed the birthday shout outs. Happy belated. All caught up. Have a great day ladies. SIS Kimberly  ",

I just smile when I think about being done and how good I feel when compared to infusion #5. Life is Good!!!! Paula- FUSE!!!! on the bone pain and not sleeping. That has got to be emotionally draining being in pain on top of not sleeping and your very busy schedule.  Knowing you, you got a couple more hours of sleep after you logged off and then got and went to work. SHERO!!! I\u2019m telling you. That\u2019s why you\u2019re getting this award.  You do so much for your kids, and they see how dedicated you are even as you deal with bc. Deb- Vent away, Deb. It does suck. It is hard. No one can see what is happening on the inside or even all that is happening on the outside as clearly as we can.  I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having a tough go this time. Only one more to go, Deb. You can do it.  I know that last one seems far away, and then there\u2019s the anxiety of not wanting to go through it again just when you\u2019re starting to feel better. About not crying yet. Everyone handles their feelings in different ways. Like I said in my post after coming out of my last fog, \u201cAs humans, we do not like having our mortality thrust in our faces.  We want to believe that we are all going to live long and wonderful lives, so when something rises up and challenges you, \"You wanna bet?\", it tends to shake you right to the core.  Often that shaking up does not happen right away.  Being in survival mode tends to put one on a path with blinders on moving one step at a time and keeping to the plan that will get you to the buried treasure\u2026back to your life.  When the treasure is found, you are left to wonder, \"Now what do I do?\", because you know that you can never go back to the life that you were leading before.  The journey has changed you, and change is not always easy.  It takes readjustment, and that takes time and patience\u201d.  Be patient with yourself. You are in survival mode right now, and eventually you will allow the tears to flow. You are not weird at all for not having cried. You are Deb. As Julie stated, you are the number one priority. Take care of yourself. Work will be there when you can be there. Carol- Thanks for the update on D1.  Kick some cancer booty today. Julie- Pace yourself. Have a good day. I\u2019ll check in later, SIS Kimberly",

We had a great time. My arms and chest muscles sure got a work out from clapping. D1- You GO Girl!!!!!  What a gift you gave to that couple! And speaking of go girl, how  great the dd is getting to shoot more! Only 5 more to go!!!! What a sweetheart of a dh to make reservations to celebrate at Ruth Chris Steak House\u2026your family has much to celebrate.  Hope the boosts don\u2019t interfere with your boob healing enough to not be so painful by then. Carol- Yippee on making it through the training walk with no tummy se\u2019s and having enough energy to get out and plant stuff in the yard. LOL on the \u201cchips\u201d comments.  No problem getting mileage out of my chemo brain moment. Glad I can contribute to the laughter, which is sooo good for us. Nope, not even guac on those chip things had taste\u2026texture, but not real flavor.  Let me know how you liked the recipe. The dh and I got our reservations all together for a little getaway to Arizona yesterday. We\u2019ll spend 4 days in Flagstaff and go to the Grand Canyon and stuff, then go to Sedona for 5 days. I can\u2019t wait to get away and have time that has nothing to do with doctors, se\u2019s, or anything else other than spending time with my dh, who had been working his butt off at work and to take care of me these past six months. Julie-  Crap, another migrain?  Have you heard of the book called the Schwartzbein Principal? I think I spelled her name correctly. I just got it. She is an endocrinologist, and her work focuses on how the food we eat, or don\u2019t eat, really messes up our hormones (all of them not just the female hormones) and how important that balance is to our overall health. She explains how food and hormones effect the body in a way that is easy to understand.  She spent 6 years putting together her research after finding that heart patients seemed to develop diabetes down the road on the low fat diet they were on, and that diabetics never got better, but actually got worse on the low fat diet they were put on. Over the course of the last 10 plus years, she\u2019s been sent patients with all kinds of health issues, and has found that eating from the four food groups, eating real food, not processed or prepackaged stuff, with every meal, that patient health and vitality improved dramatically over time. Anyway, she talks about, and has patient stories about, migraines disappearing or at least becoming infrequent, kids with ADD getting better, people with diabetes getting off of insulin, people with high blood pressure getting off meds, people with cholesterol issues getting off meds etc. You might want to check it out if it can help you reduce or eliminate the migraines. The bonus, is that every patient who was overweight, had their body return to its optimal weight without counting calories or denying themselves food as long as it was real food. Of course, she advocated exercise, too, but even those who had limited ability to do more than walk did well.  She states that people eating processed, prepackaged, and high carb foods- what she calls man-made foods- can easily overeat because there is no nutritional value. Real food won\u2019t let you overeat. Your body regulates feeling full with real food, but doesn\u2019t with man-made food. What a bummer about not being to plant this year. Hopefully you have a neighborhood where others have planted, and you can take long walks and enjoy looking at the neighbors\u2019 yards. Isn\u2019t it amazing that adults can be just as irresponsible as our students when it comes to turning in incomplete work or nothing at all?  Good luck with that. Let us know as soon as you know when your surgery date is, OK? KathyL- Hmmm, I\u2019m going to have to ask my ps why some use drains after an exchange and some don\u2019t. I will be thinking of you today as you start your new chapter in life. WhooHoo!!!!  Hope the ear is better and that the ds\u2019 strep is under control with the antibiotics. Paula- Could you copy and paste or upload the article into the comment section since you scanned it onto your computer? If not, I\u2019ll PM my email address. Have a great day at work. I\u2019m sure there will be talk about your interview while on the Komen walk and the article today.  Bask in your accomplishments, girlfriend. You so deserve it. Vettegal- We\u2019re all sending Vettesis positive vibes today. No one is in the lounge today, so as Kathy suggested, for those who can, life a cold one for those of us who can\u2019t. For those Jewels that have been MIA, our best wishes that all is well go out to you as well. Sorry for being so long winded, SIS Kimberly",

Bravo.  I just saw the ps today, and my exchange is scheduled for June 6th. I\u2019ll be home from our 10 day \u2018cation on the 1st, so the timing is perfect. I will have the drains in for 10 days, then have five days after they\u2019re out before I leave for Chicago.  I can\u2019t wait to get these coconuts off my chest. Contouring under the arms?  So, when do you get to unwrap the girls? LOL, the wash cloth story is hysterical!!!!! I will have to copy it and send it to my girlfriends. Wonderful words of wisdom for PALady. PALady- Congratulations on your last tanning session. Your happy/OMG what to I do now cry is totally expected after going to the cancer center daily for so long. Just give yourself time to take it all in and enjoy the freedom to do with your time what you please...or at least the time you spend at the cancer center. So, are you done, done, or just done with this step? Carol- Whew (wiping sweat off the brow) on getting through that call without an emotional incident. I can understand how not losing all of your hair, feeling pretty good most of the time, still working, and not letting on at times when you feel like crap could cause others to forget that you\u2019re dealing with cancer, and that Zack, on top of puberty is dealing with his fears about his mom.  I\u2019m glad the dh is so supportive, and that you and the ex were able to come to an agreement about Zack\u2019s license. Awesome that you live within the city limits, and Zack can walk to potential job sites. That\u2019s a huge plus.  Yep, no holes means he\u2019s dressing up, Mom. Yes, sauté the spinach in the olive oil and garlic, then mix it in with the fresh chopped basil and ricotta. I\u2019m so glad your smiley face is bringing you such pleasure. The good news is that you can fill it with anything you want afterwards, and it will keep on smiling. Being weepy is definitely a hormone thing. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to talk about it to the doc tomorrow. I\u2019ve never had PMS weepiness. Shoot, there\u2019s a chance I could experience that with chemo-pause?  Heckendorns!!!! LOL on the mustache comment.  Tina- No, I\u2019ve never been to Arizona before, so I\u2019m so looking forward to it. I have heard that Sedona is a very healing and spiritual place rich in Native American history, so I\u2019m going to be hitting a museum or two for sure. I hadn\u2019t heard of the skywalk. I\u2019ll be checking out the link you gave me. Thanks. Kathy- Sounds like you\u2019ve got some energy today. Could it be because you didn\u2019t have to work?  I am only assuming so since you said, \u201cBack to work tomorrow.\u201d  Shadowing your partner sounds way more fun than sitting and listening to orientation stuff. Have fun! So, those of you watching. What did you think of the DWTS results show? OK, so I guess I\u2019d better get myself in the kitchen and get dinner prepared.  Check in tomorrow morning ladies.

      "Content": "May 22, 2008 02:09PM - edited May 22, 2008 08:45PM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, I slept in today. I must have been really whooped after the past few days of activity. The wind is blowing like crazy here. Weird. I looked up the weather in Flagstaff and Sedona\u2026rain and lightening up to Sat. Temps in the 50\u2019s and low 60\u2019s. Hoping it gets sunnier for our arrival. Cross your fingers gals. D1- Wow, you did get lots of brain drain info yesty. I would suggest that you have a medical professional run your pathology numbers through adjuventonline.com  It is a site for medical professionals to get the stats regarding treatment options based on your pathology. The report is called Shared Decision Making.  According to the results for me, doing Hormonal Therapy had a 12% to 19% benefit. Chemotherapy had a much better result for me. It couldn\u2019t hurt to know these stats in order to help you make your decision about what to do regarding participating in the studies or not. Food for thought:  Oncology News reported in Oct. of 07 that premenopausal women can do ovarian suppression with Tamox or Ovarian ablation in lieu of suppression is stated to be an acceptable alternative. There is no evidence that total estrogen blockage prevents recurrence. The Treatment Tools section of the American Cancer Society also stated that an Ooph is just as effective in premenopausal women.  Several studies also show that to be true. Another study released this past March stated that women taking Tamox , who developed a recurrence had twice the amount of estrogen floating in their blood stream. 2/3 of the women in the study were on Tamox. My question: So, if too much free floating estrogen is the issue, then blocking receptors so estrogen can\u2019t bond means the estrogen has to go somewhere, so it floats freely in the blood?  Tamox is a weak estrogen like phytoestrogens that fights with our body\u2019s own natural estrogen for receptor sites in tumor tissue. It works to block estrogen in the breast, but acts as an estrogen in other areas of the body which has been linked to uterine cancer, liver cancer, fatal blood clots, and interference with many other body functions. Interesting. Also, in 1992, (Tamox has been in use since the 1970\u2019s) the Lancet published a review of a number of studies in which a total of 30,000 breast cancer patients were randomly assigned either Tamox or not. The average patient was followed for between five and six years. Of the patients taking Tamox, 74.4 per cent survived as compared to 70.9 per cent of those who did not take Tamox. It was concluded that the difference is pretty insignificant when weighed against the side effects of Tamox. So, based on the above info, knowing if you are premenopausal or not is really key to your decision making. OK, enough of this\u2026 I was thrilled with Kristi\u2019s win. She so deserved it. Hope today isn\u2019t so hectic for you. Again, I was tired just reading all you did. I\u2019m thinking about hiring a cleaning service. My issue is having someone have access to my house when I\u2019m not home. Reputable companies are bonded, so that\u2019s something. Carol-  Bummer about the site eating your lengthy post!  I can totally understand the need for your lanyard fan- cool idea BTW. That dh is always thinkin\u2019 of you. Sweet. WhooHoo regarding seeing you the weekend of the 15th/16th. We should have the Open sign done by then. I too emailed Jenn with no response.  Glad you had her phone number.  I hope she just needed a break from the  whole bc thing and will return your call to at least confirm that. Well, hope all of our other Jewels are doing well this morning. I\u2019ll check back in after the baby shower for the twins born to our counselor. It will be a quiet day today. SIS Kimberly",

That is so life affirming to have a call like the one you had from your old friend. It is like when a student comes back and says thanks to a teacher. Priceless validation.  Good night all, SIS Kimberly ",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2008 06:35PM - edited Jun 4, 2008 06:53PM by SISKimberly Good afternoon ladies, Busy day. Got caught up on business stuff, online banking and the like, then it was off to the plastic surgeon\u2019s office.  I\u2019m all inked up and ready to be exchanged and lifted this Friday. WhooHoo!!!! Didn\u2019t make it to school until after lunch. My appt ran late, so figured since I was late anyway, I'd stop by REI to pick up some stainless steel water bottles. No more plastics for me. I replaced my plastic storage containers with glass, and don\u2019t plan to replace the baggies, larger ziplocks, or garbage bags when they run out either.  Maybe too over the top, but when hydrogenated oils are one molecule away from plastic it makes me wonder about the power of our oil industry since plastics are made from fossil fuel products. Went to get the ole port flushed since I missed it yesty, and brought flowers to a coworker just finishing chemo today while she was at the lounge. Speaking of the lounge, the nurse who discovered breast cancer while pregnant, the one I gave the Super Girl cape to had her baby.  A boy\u2026almost 7 pounds and 4 weeks premature. Can you imagine how big he would have been had he gone another 4 weeks?  She\u2019s a tiny little thing, so having him early was a blessing in disguise. He\u2019s so cute\u2026Ok, the picture of him is so cute since I didn\u2019t get to see the real deal. Paula- Wow, I\u2019m so sorry that you didn\u2019t get the news you and Ed were expecting. I am glad that you\u2019ve got access to lots of information about the drugs being used and do hope the insurance will help cover the other costs for the drug study. I wish there was more I could do or say to help make this set back easier for you guys. I\u2019m sending lots of positive energy out into the universe for you and your family as you make your way through this new maze of decision making. (((((HUGS))))) Kathy- OK, so the description of the tattoo sounded like it was painful, but you didn\u2019t say anything about it being painful. I can handle EEEWWW.  Can you believe you\u2019re done with the whole reconstruction already? I totally remember being in ballet as a kid and how much I loved it. I didn\u2019t get into gymnastics until 7th grade when we left the Santa Cruz area since Truckee didn\u2019t have a dance class. How cool that you have connected with someone that works with you now and that you\u2019ll be helping new cancer patients through treatment as a \u201cpeer mentor\u201d. There goes another Jewel spreading the bc support around. Man how do we Jewels just shine!!!! I hope your GI troubles have calmed down by the time you read this, Kathy. LOL on channeling D1 for a little extra cash to get a cleaning lady to come to your house. D1- So, your painters didn\u2019t just look at your balditude and say, \u201cFor you, the whole house for $1500?\u201d  Geez, what\u2019s up with that? I\u2019m with you on the cleaning in between visits, but I won\u2019t go whole hog or anything. Just spot cleaning- dusting and counters. I will definitely let the cleaning service do the hard stuff.  The service leaves a score card at the end of each visit, so the teacher in me will love \u2018grading\u2019 each standard of clean. HeeHee ABSOLUTLY RIGHT ON regarding being at peace with my decision. I just thought it was kinda interesting to see my usually very enthusiastic oncologist shut down and just not talk to me after I said NO after every reason he gave me for doing rads and Tamox, and supplied my own research facts. I know he cares about me, and that he knows it is my choice not to pursue further treatment, but feel the bigger issue might be that he may never have been challenged before, which caught him off guard.  Like I said, after his long vacation in Greece, he\u2019ll have gotten over it. Besides, my winning personality will not be easily shunned. HaHaHa LJ13- Your hair description sounds goofy for sure. My friends came in growing all forward towards her face except the back.  We so need to post hair pics at different stages. That would be great! As Carol stated, much more fun than talking about digestive troubles and funky nails, eh? Jenn- Me too on the beet thing- picture me sticking out my tongue right now \u2013 blah!!! We have blueberries, a peach tree, a lemon tree, a blood orange tree, tomatoes, zucchini, and a variety of herbs, avocado, and our little vineyard of wine grapes growing in our back yard. Greg wanted an edible yard. I\u2019ll second the going topless motion as a badge of honor and courage!!! I go topless in public all the time and don\u2019t think twice about it. But then like you said, Jenn, I don\u2019t have teens at home who worry about how this impacts them and what others will think. Try a magnesium and Vit. D supplement for the restless legs\u2026and they are good for the blues, too. Melatonin is also great for sleep and as an added bonus has been cited as blocking estrogen receptors like Tamox does. Glad the storms missed ya. Carol- I\u2019m so sorry about your crummy tummy. You\u2019re almost done, though!!!!  Keep that light firmly fixed in sight. I was thinking about doing the Reach To Recovery program as well. I haven\u2019t really looked into it specifically, just read about it on the American Cancer Society website. What do you mean helping just one person? You\u2019ve already helped several in your area! I have no doubt if you get involved with this program that you will certainly help out more than one cancer patient. My surgery is Friday. Tomorrow is a be at school all day kind of day since it is the last day to see my kids and say, \u201cHave a great summer, see ya in August.\u201d We\u2019re having a Pot Luck luncheon for the staff after school, so that should be fun. I tasted a slice of pizza today at school. I was so excited I could taste it. Yep, things are picking up in the ole taste bud dept. for sure! I,too, am a commute from hell widow. My dh doesn\u2019t get home until 6:30 or later, so dinner is usually around 7:30 or 8:00, which is too late in my book, but what are ya gonna do? Hope the cream of wheat- just a guess- was good on the tummy and that you were able to sleep through the night. Sleep well Jewels. OK I just had the urge to do the Waltons\u2019 good night John Boy routine. HeeHee Good night, D1, Good night, Carol, Good night, Kathy, Good night, Paula, Good night, Tina, Good night, Julie, Good night, CathyCa, Good night, Sherry, Good night, Jenn51, Good night,Patty, Good night, Joan, Good night, CarolJ, Good night, Norma, Good night, LW Dana, Good night, ARDeb, Good night, Carla, Good night, Maz, Good night, AZ Donna, Good night, CarolC, Good night, Kris60, Good night, Wendy, Good night, Therese, Goodnight, Sheebas, Goodnight, Sista, Good night JKiss.   I\u2019ll check in after school tomorrow. SIS  Kimberly PS CathyCa and Julie- You must have been composing while I was in Word. Julie, hope the ds' basketball 'try' was a good experience for him and the the dh decides to honor his  summer 'cation. I know he's a valued employee for certain, but taking time for himself and the family this year will be extra important and needed. I know that teaching all year leaves me needing those summer weeks for rejuvination and recharging.  OK....I'm going to admit that I just stopped composing so I could get up and dance around and sing Walking on Sunshine....can't sit still with songs that have such a great beat.  CathyCa- Haven't seen the new Indi movie, but want to see it. Maybe next week when I won't be able to do much else with drains hanging out of my body.  I'll hide 'em under a loose shirt and have a friend or family member take me to theater so I can drool over Harrison Ford. ",

      "Content": "Jun 30, 2008 04:51PM - edited Jun 30, 2008 04:58PM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, The skies have finally cleared after being in a smoky haze for the past week. We can see the sun and the clouds today\u2026such a pleasure to see again. Thanks to all of you for wishing me and the twinsis a happy b-day. Boy, were you talkative this weekend. I\u2019ve read all the posts, but won\u2019t be doing individual shout outs as I\u2019ve got a lengthy post already with the Chicago and Bday update, and you\u2019ll be reading all day if I add shout outs. Our party was a HUGE success. We had 22 guests and the restaurant outdid them selves taking care of us. We arrived at 5pm and didn\u2019t leave until 11pm. Everyone just raved about the food and service.   My cousin flew in from Vegas,which was such a treat as we haven\u2019t seen her in years. Spending time with our friends and family was the best gift we received. I\u2019ll upload pics ASAP. Greg\u2019s got the camera and cord for the computer. So, I promised you a travel log of my Chicago trip with pictures, so here we go\u2026 June 21,2008 Kathleen and I were bumped up to First Class (Kath flies often and is a Silver Club member on US Air) all the way to Chicago (had a layover in Vegas, then changed planes) Wow!!!! I had never flown First Class before. I had always wondered what comforts lay beyond that silly flimsy curtain which separated those eight or so larger comfy looking seats, two to a row, sharing one forward compartment lavatory from the rest of the coach passengers packed in like sardines, seats three to a row, sharing two lavatories at the back of the plane.  Now I know!  Immediate service upon sitting, hot warm towels to freshen up with before lunch, which happened to be served on china with real silverware.  First Class had a choice for lunch while coach passengers had to pay $5 for a snack box.  First Class had access to the onboard movie, The Spiderwich Chronicles, however, coach had to pay $5 to rent the headsets. I imagined being in a situation where we would have to reach for our oxygen masks then leap from the plane with our seat cushion flotation devices and having the flight crew announce to coach,\u201dPlease remain in your seats. There is no need to  panic. If you would like oxygen or a flotation device, there is a $5 fee for each. We will be by to collect your fee. We would appreciate exact change please.\u201d HeeHee. Anyway, First Class got to get up and use the facilities even during food service, but coach passengers were trapped in their seats until the service carts were stowed or had passed their seats.  All in all, if one can afford it, First Class is definitely the way to travel.  I admit, now that I\u2019ve experienced the world behind the curtain, I\u2019ve been spoiled and think travel any other way is \u2026well\u2026just wrong, which leads to the question why passengers are willing to put up with such crowded conditions and limited service.  Ahhhh yes, the price one pays for convenience at the cheapest price. During our layover in Vegas, I won $50! SAA_WEET!!! We arrived in the Windy City around 5pm. The Windy City, which in case inquiring minds wanted to know, is so called not because of the weather, but because during the World Fair hosted there, a famous newspaper columnist noted that citizens of Chicago were full of exaggerations, excessively bragged about the attributes of their city, and were in general very long winded. After collecting our luggage (yes, mine did arrive unlike on my trip to Flagstaff/Sedona), we located a cab to take us to the Chicago Hilton on Michigan Avenue at a cost of only $42 for the approximate 30 minute drive.  May I just say cab drivers in Chicago, like most large cities I imagine, are either incredibly focused and aware of everything going on around them with lightening fast reflexes, or adrenaline junkies who have absolutely no fear nor regard for other vehicles around them as they bully their way through congested streets.  I like to think the cabbie we entrusted our lives to was a Zen Master rather than Evil Knievilesk. Upon arriving at the Chicago Hilton, which is the gem on Michigan Avenue in my opinion due to its history as the largest luxury hotel in the world during its hayday in the late 1800\u2019s. Today, it maintains many of its original architectural features and a Grand Ballroom that still has huge crystal chandeliers. It is still evident that this hotel caters to the higher end guest\u2026thank you Kathleen and TSYS (her company). The staff was so friendly and ready to serve from the doorman to the hotel manager.  Fabulous customer service. When Kath and I walked into our room, Room 1752, we were surprised to see not only two beds, but two bathrooms as well. We didn\u2019t have a view, but weren\u2019t planning on spending time in our room looking out the window. Once unpacked, we walked across the street to Grant Park, a large park that stretches a good ten or more blocks and connects to Millenium Park to the North and to the Museum Campus to the South-East.  Literally across the street from our hotel the Chicago Summer Dance Series was underway among beautiful flowerbeds and planters, lush grassy areas, and tree shaded walkways. Fountains and statues were scattered throughout as were little tucked away spots where people could read, contemplate, or cozy up to their sweeties. Of course, the grassy spots also offered seating as did park benches, steps, and the wide edges of plant boxes filled with pinks, purples, oranges, and yellows.  People of all ages gathered to listen and dance,and not just on the dance floor, to the sizzling sounds of Salsa played from the stage. Kath and I salsa\u2019d our way down the side walk and across on of several bridges crossing over the tracks and headed towards a large blocked off area.  It appeared a large event was either being dismantled or assembled.  We passed a statue of Abraham Lincoln, said \u2018Hey Abe\u2019 and walked back over the bridge where I asked some of Chicago\u2019s finest what was happening back where we\u2019d just been. Apparently, we just missed the Zombie Parade. Also, the city was setting up for their annual Taste of Chicago event happening June 27th through July 4th. I still don\u2019t know what a Zombie Parade is or if I\u2019m sorry I missed it or not. We didn\u2019t quite make it to Millenium Park, but we did pass the Metra enterance, which Kath explained looked just like the Metro in Paris, and the large lion statues that flank the Chicago Art Institute before crossing the street to head back towards the hotel in search of dinner. Kath and I settled on a place that called itself The Artist\u2019s Shack. It\u2019s menu was a combination of Greek, Italian, and American cuisine.  We decided on Greek. While enjoying our meal on the patio, a homeless man approached me and asked if I would buy him a meal. He talked really slow like someone who is either weak and tired or under the influence.  I chose to believe he was the former since it was a meal he asked for and not money. I told him I\u2019d be happy to buy him a meal, unfortunately the restaurant staff told me that wasn\u2019t going to happen when I went inside to order. Apparently, he and a friend do this a lot and the restaurant didn\u2019t want to encourage this behavior.  When I returned to my seat, the police had arrived and were talking to him and asking him to move on, which he was reluctant to do stating I was buying him a meal. I told him I had tried, but was told I could not. Kath and I offered our leftovers- rice, chicken, and veggies, but he refused stating it wasn\u2019t what he wanted. He asked again for me to buy him a meal, and again I explained that I couldn\u2019t. The police asked him to move on at that point. I felt badly for him,but thought he wasn\u2019t hungry enough if he turned down the leftovers we offered. It was a good amount of food. Kath and I could have split one meal.  Ahhh, what a world we live in where people are living on the streets and hungry. How can this be with such abundance on the one hand, and the amount of waste on the other? When we got back to the hotel, we ran into two of Kathleen\u2019s coworkers, Judy and Diane, from the Arizona office. They had taken the \u2018scenic\u2019 route to the hotel via the subway from the airport\u2026a four hour journey lost in Chicago\u2026but they were still smiling. OK, that\u2019s all for today. I\u2019ll write the next entry tomorrow, Jewels. Love to all, SIS Kimberly Kimby and Kathleenie at the airport, and then a pic of the hotel.",

Had appetizers and a glass or two of wine for a few hours, then BBQ'd some Buffalo steaks, Slough House corn, and Sweet Potatoes to go with our salad and whole grain bread. Yummy. Made a red,white, and blue berry dessert with organic berries and creme fraiche with nutmeg.  That was a hit as well.   After dinner we headed outside to watch the kids on the street with their families doing the fireworks thing. I like our neighborhood as everyone is so friendly.  Got to bed around 11:30. Fun day. Carol, your third sounded great!!!  Your 4th plans sounded nice as well.  Boating to dinner....nice. You know, the fact that you so know that you have a tough time communicating about the hard stuff is a huge plus. Awknowledging that is the first step to being aware when it is happening and facing the fear and talking anyway.  Kent loves you, and he knows you love him.  Crying while getting your fears and feelings out is OK, and Kent will be OK with that, no doubt. The fact you're communicating is what counts. Hope your rads appt. went well and wasn't too uncomfortable.  I'm glad your hoot isn't burned yet...but the tightening isn't a fun thing for sure.  If you can, gently stretch as much as possible to keep the muscles from contracting too much. You may be needing some PT at the end of all of this like D1. Greg and I just got back from seeing WALL-E.  A cute movie with a social message about America's love affair with consumerism, the media/technololgy, and wastefulness. It touches on people's reliance on media for communication rather than face to face discussions and how relationships really don't seem to exist due to the control media/technololgy has over our lives. Most importantly, it highlights how asleep so many of us are as we buy our happiness and are hooked on media/technology for our entertainment and connection to others while our planet deteriorates to become uninhabitable.  Small kids loved the characters, but I  was hoping bigger kids were getting some of the bigger messages being sent. OK girls, hope you're all having a fabulous weekend. SIS Kimberly",

Today, there's nothing big on the books. Anyway, range of motion is back, but rotator cuff issues ensue. He wanted to tape my left shoulder today to keep my shoulder ball in the socket, but told him that I just couldn\u2019t do that unless he had silk tape as I was highly allergic to adhesives. He was bummed as he knows it will help, so will have to order silk tape for me and tape me up when it arrives.  I stopped by my women\u2019s gym to pick up their July schedule and will start doing cardio workouts Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays along with leg work via the machines.  No arms for me unless it is PT until released with PTBabydoc\u2019s blessing. Hey CHJ- I\u2019m so glad my card found you. Thanks for your new address, I\u2019ll make sure to update the address list.  Sounds like everything is going along smoothly with the exception of the annoyances of going to rads daily, but the good news is you\u2019ll be done by next Wednesday, right?   That\u2019s great you\u2019re already dialed into your new neighborhood. That makes a big the difference in the ole comfort level doesn\u2019t it? Even if you only check in every few weeks to say, HI, that\u2019s OK by us. Kathy \u2013 Quiet is good!  Hope the PS appt. goes well and that she\u2019s game for giving your foob a bit more color. If you can get buffalo where you live, try it. It\u2019s really good. Julie \u2013 Yeah!!!! Glad to hear the kids and puppies did so well. Have fun. Look forward to hearing about the trip upon your return. Carol \u2013 Tongue cancer without ever having used tobacco products?  Hmmm, that\u2019s weird and horrible for your friend Ginny\u2019s nephew. So, how do you deal with that I wonder? Glad you could bed there for his mom and for him. Just as you\u2019re nearing the end of the journey, you\u2019re there to help someone at the beginning of theirs, again. Buffalo is pricey, only because it isn\u2019t in demand yet. Once more people start asking for it, then maybe more people will raise buffalo instead of beef cattle\u2026of course, if beef cattle were eating grass instead of grain, they\u2019d be healthier animals, and be much better for us and taste better, too.  We get one steak, and I eat about ¼ of it and Greg eats the rest. You are so welcome for the encouragement to do what you already know you want to do. I\u2019m glad you were able to think away your doubts about what you can share online with us as you\u2019re right about us being the ones to really understand.   I babysat a family when I lived in Tahoe that had an indoor pool. It was great!  Hope your Dad can get his asking price and have his new home ready at the same time as his old home closes escrow. Not a ham gal myself, but if my man loved it and made it for dinner, I\u2019d be in there, too. I\u2019m doing that with Halibut tonight. Hoping my taste buds have changed, and I find I like it now. Welcome home Paula.  Glad your trip was a success especially for Ed. I agree that your ds can wait until the August event for the college orientation as it will be closer to when he starts anyway, and fresher in his mind. Cathy \u2013 I wish your oldest ds all the best as he tries out his new sober choices when he\u2019s released.  Hoping that the multiple reinforcements will kick in for him this time. Wow, what a great parent/student orientation. That sounds like so much fun.  Enjoy! Deb \u2013 I\u2019m so glad your fishing trip was a success, so much so that you\u2019ve booked another for Labor Day.  That\u2019s a big trout\u2026I love trout both alive and on my plate. They are a beautiful fish. Did you keep him or release him? I read Cure and Mamm when in the docs offices, but choose not to subscribe. I don\u2019t want bc to be how I identify myself, and if I got a magazine each month, it would just be like validating that this disease still has a hold on me\u2026but again, that\u2019s just weird, me. I\u2019ll see ya later gals, SIS Kimberly   At our birthday bash. Vegan cake ordered by Kathleen\u2019s honey as she\u2019s allergic to eggs sits in front of us. It was soooo yummy. Kathleen and Kimberly in front. Cousin Suzanne and older sis, Terrie, in the back.",

I was picked for jury duty, so I'm in court all day, then have to run to school to plan for the sub each day afterwards. I'm exhausted. So much for getting a workout in when I'm just getting home at 7pm each night.  Oh well. Doing my civic duty. I do walk during our 15 minute recesses, and I did sit ups on the ball tonight. Afraid there won't be any weight loss this week at the rate I'm going. Love the pics Carol!!!! How was the ole pedi and massage? Sherry - Man, you're having a heck of a time...your back, gallbladder, court... I'm so trying to send you my left over energy...come on Jewels, let's combine our positive energy flow and send it Sherry's way. And Jenn, we've missed you.  And we need to do the same for our dear Jenn.  Oh, Jenn, I'm so sorry things are just feeling so dark and low for you.  Talking things out is good for the soul, so feel free to vent here...know you are not alone. ((((HUGS)))) Joan - I so hear you on getting back to school and just getting slammed with so much to do. To all our sisters experiencing weather like Ike, my thoughts are with you. S.P. I am so sorry that I've been so busy and neglectful.  I will rectify that next week when things calm down...hopefully the trial ends Friday.  GTG, I'm starving. SIS Kimberly ",

I'm sorry Zach isn't pulling is weight.  My students, a vast majority, are not either. I swear they do not do homework or study.  Hopefully, with all the parents being vigilent, he'll get his act together. It would suck to lose his job and his skating. I totally agree that the whole jury duty, sub not doing what needed to done, and not being on top of my game at school is nothing compared to what I was doing just a few months ago. Thanks for reminding me that this is all just little shit!  I got an email from Sherry.  She's had her surgery and got the staples out.  She is sore and hoping to get back to work on the 7th.  She's still planning to do her cancer walk - 5k and asked me to put her website on the Jewels page.  I've already donated, so if others want to do so as well, here it is: http://main.acsevents.org/site/TR/MakingStridesAgainstBreastCancer/MSABCFY09GreatLakes?px=8018074&pg=personal&fr_id=11661&s_tafId=193967 Speaking of walks, Cathy CA, did I already donate to your walk?  I thought I did, but I can't recall. I rode my bike to the store this afternoon, hung out with a gal friend (it was her dh's 50th party we went to last night) and registered Democrats, had lunch, then rode home.  I've been working on curriculum this afternoon, and yesterday, I did get my grading done.  Your trip to Arizona for 10 days during Thanksgiving sounds delightful!  I'll have my port out that week, so I don't think I'll be traveling.   Hope Schatzie's cough improves.  I'd like to say I'll check in this week, but I doubt it. I will try. Have a great week, you all. SIS Kimberly ",

      "Content": "Oct 12, 2008 06:44PM - edited Oct 12, 2008 06:56PM by SISKimberly Thank you all for your kind words and support over the news of my twinsis.  Thankfully, the tumor is only 7mm, so it's small. The breast MRI I encouraged her to ask for instead of a mammogram considering our family history saved her a year of waiting to find it.  The mammo they did do right before the biopsy showed nothing. Had she had the mammo first, her doctor would have given her the all clear, and she would have known nothing for another year maybe longer.  So, that's a blessing. Carla, I was so glad to see you\u2019d posted.  I couldn\u2019t see the video, only hear it, but you sounded great! And Maz, and Kris, and CHJ\u2026how wonderful to hear from you, too. We\u2019ve missed you. Oh Therese, I\u2019m just 47, and no one told me I had a 50-50 chance of getting my period back.  That would not be good for me being ERPR positive.  I just pray mine stays away for good.  I haven\u2019t had any hot flashes in awhile, so now I\u2019m wondering if I too will see Aunt Flo again.  It\u2019s been since February. Oh bother!!!!  That is the least of my worries right, now, however. So SP, I\u2019m listening to my new CD Peaceful Garden right now.  I love it.  I\u2019ve loaded into my computer, so now I\u2019ll take it to school to use during quiet work time. Thank you so much. To my SP, where I got your present required me to put a return address in order to ship it, so you\u2019ll no longer be wondering who your SP is, I imagine, but that\u2019s OK\u2026it\u2019s still fun to surprise each other isn\u2019t it? Deb, wow, another voice we haven\u2019t heard in awhile.  You sound great.  How great to be volunteering at the Race for the Cure, and staying in a nice hotel right at the start of it. Good planning. Jules- Hmmm, seems appropriate to wait until the \u2018end\u2019 of the month for such a procedure\u2026even the word endoscopy has the word \u2018end\u2019 in it, and that\u2019s also the portion of the anatomy it focuses on, too\u2026.OK, sorry, I couldn\u2019t help it. I teach junior high. Glad you survived Homecoming at your school. Did your students dress all funny, like D1\u2019s daughter with her crazy outfit last week? Paula, I can just picture your beautiful backyard scenery\u2026fall colors, blue azure sky, crisp air and nature as far as you can see\u2026NICE!!!!  Thanks for thinking of my twinsis and I while communing.  Hope you have a great trip. Seems you do lots of these conference type trips with your students.  How does the school afford it?  We\u2019re having trouble just getting to go to local workshops due to costs. Sherry - Love your curls.  I'm with CHJ, no curls for me either, just more grey, but I'm not complaining, it is so easy and so soft. D1, thanks for the well wishes and support.  I do need to find twinsis a cape of her own. I loved hearing about your dd's homecoming date - the girls. How fun to just be with your galpals and not worry about boys, and then on the other side of the coin is your college girl. Man, I so remember that age and swooning over boys who were 'the one'.    I'm so proud of you for making the choice to start yoga, get massages, and see a therapist.  Yeah!!!! on all three counts. Therapy can be such a wonderful experience...hard at times, but so worth it in the long run. I bought a Wii Fit.  It is so cool.  I bowled. I played golf.  I can do yoga, aerobics, strength training, and balancing exercises and so much more.  It\u2019s very user friendly and gets others involved, too.  The whole family bowled yesterday. So, I got on the scale at 147 this morning, but I can't help but think it's water loss or dehydration again.  I was 148.5 all last week.  How could it be that I just lost it overnight?  It would be nice, but don't think so. I\u2019ve got company coming this week ( a college friend) and Greg is gone this week, so I\u2019m the entertainment goddess for the week.  We\u2019ll have dinner tomorrow with twinsis, oldersis, and ds and his gf.  Then the rest of the week, I\u2019m cooking, I guess. Take care my Jewel friends, SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Nov 1, 2008 02:25PM - edited Nov 1, 2008 02:53PM by SISKimberly Wow, did this week fly by or what? We had a neighborhood or two worth of little ghosts, goblins, angels, superheroes, and princesses show up last night. OMG, I love seeing kids in their costumes and parents out with their kids. So, yesterday, I\u2019d finally had enough with my 6th period class. The day before, I\u2019d given them something to work on while I called each one up individually to give them which sentences they were to do for our review day. The noise level kept going up, and I\u2019d remind them they were being given time to get their work done so it didn\u2019t have to go home. It would be quiet for a few minutes, then start all over again.  It was the same group of kids who didn\u2019t get anything done I\u2019m sure.  Anyway, so yesterday, I said, \u201cThose of you who were chatting yesterday instead of getting your work done, if you\u2019ld like to do that again today, take your things to the back table. At first they weren\u2019t sure what was going on. \u201cAre we in trouble\u201d.  \u201cNo, I\u2019m just giving you a choice to go to the back table and waste your time again, while the rest of us learn and do the day\u2019s activity or to join us.\u201d  \u201cDo we have to go to the back table?\u201d \u201cOnly if you would rather talk than learn something.\u201d I had 1/3 off the class go to the back\u2026the same ones that didn\u2019t do anything the day before, or really do much in the past 10 weeks, but be more social than not. I had the other kids fill in the spaces so they were all up front and center. They asked, \u201cAre these our new seats?\u201d  \u201cYep\u201d. They were stoked. We talked about grades coming up in two weeks and what things contribute to their learning. We had a great conversation, and they made it very clear to those at the back table that their talking and disruptions during class were not welcome. Yep, good ole peer pressure. We talked about how everything we\u2019d covered so far was connected and how important it is to practice the skills over and over to be able to build onto the next skill, which is why things may seem repetitive sometimes. Finally, we read a scary story.  The back table (and kids sitting on the floor) were reminded several times to whisper because we were trying to learn.  At the end of the period, my students had only a few pages left to read for homework. Most had already finished their characterization assignment from the previous day and their three sentences. They all thanked me for what I\u2019d done and asked if we could do that all the time.  I told them that I\u2019d give that option daily and discuss with the class next week how life is all about choices and being able to live with the consequences of those choices. That I\u2019d mention that in life the easy road is often the one that leads no where. I\u2019m done trying to fight this battle with kids who don\u2019t want to do what is asked of them. I\u2019m going to focus on those that care and make an effort.  I did have one kid at the back ask if he could change his mind. I imagine he\u2019ll be sitting at a desk on Monday. The back table was reminded that over the weekend, they needed to read the entire story by themselves, make sure their characterization homework was done, and their sentences. More than ½ of that group just put their books back in the cupboard and walked out the door when the bell rang.  Yep, they made it clear \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019re not doing homework\u201d.  Hmmm, hope they are ready to except the consequences of that choice when I give that pop quiz on Monday about the story and check off the homework. Enough about school\u2026just felt like this little experiment was a small reflection of our society. I wonder how long it will take before they tire of that and feel like they might be missing something worthwhile. I talked with my dh about how I\u2019ve been feeling, and he was soooo wonderful. Listened and comforted me. No lectures. I am soooo lucky. Speaking of lucky, Kath just emailed that she scored tickets to Wicked in S.F. in June. Therese, I agree about \u2018coming home\u2019 to visit with our sisters and let our hair down\u2026what there is of it\u2026so to speak. Being able to share here is such a gift. It is logical that we\u2019d share not only our fears in the beginning, our frustrations, concerns, and se\u2019s during, and now our every day \u2018new\u2019 normal lives, and the blues as we face anniversaries.  It\u2019s hard to believe that I was in the midst of MRI\u2019s, PET scans, second biopsies, appointments with the oncologist, surgeon, and plastic surgeon only a year ago this month-It\u2019s November already! Speaking of November, we have two birthday girls in November. Paula on the 5th and Jules on the 30th!. I don\u2019t have everyone\u2019s birthdays on the Jewel mailing list, so if I missed someone, let me know. D1- Your time on the island sounds like such a spirit booster!  Helping people gain access to knowledge is huge! Hope you got your fresh seafood and got in some sun time before you hop on that plane tomorrow. I\u2019ve not been the best about my exercise. Just walking and three days of my ball exercises. No Wii time. I\u2019ve been bouncing back and forth between 146 and 148. Frustrating. I\u2019ve got to get myself out of my room after school before 6 pm. I had every intention of not being at school past 4:30, but I just feel like I\u2019m treading water still\u2026I know, patience. Jules \u2013 The good news about doing your procedure right before Thanksgiving is your digestive tract will be so clean that you\u2019ll have plenty of room for Thanksgiving dinner. HeeHee  I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re dealing with a hemmoroid issue, too.  I\u2019m thinking with the crap (pun intended) our poor GI tracts went through with chemo, that there\u2019s still healing going on\u2026don\u2019t ya think? It\u2019s raining here\u2026nice. Today is just a sit back with the fire and relax day.  I\u2019m so in need of down time as I\u2019m sure you are too. 10 weeks into school, and I\u2019m still exhausted every day. Yep, those darn kids just grow up don\u2019t they!  So, what did the ds and his friends opt to do for Halloween?  I had some teenagers come last night to Trick or Treat. I\u2019m thinking 14 or 15 is the oldest before they decide not to go anymore.  Their costumes were cute, but a little too  'sexy' in my opinion, but I heard there isn't much of a choice with premade costumes in the teen section. OMG, is that picture a hoot (no hoots for her yet though)? Love that facial expression. LJ13 \u2013 I\u2019ve not had my period since February, but I\u2019ve not experienced the same hot flashes I had while on chemo. Night sweats I\u2019m still doing, I think,  but my dh has been throwing covers off at night lately, too. Hmmm, you suppose he\u2019s going through the change? HaaHaaHaa  Or is it just too warm, and I\u2019m not really having night sweats at all? I\u2019d like to think that the herbals and vitamins are just controlling these symptoms for me, or that I\u2019m just done with all of that\u2026but is that possible so soon? CHJ- Thanks for your story. Hearing from you, a two-time survivor, puts this into perspective. It will just take time to accept and settle into the new \u2018normal\u2019. I\u2019m not so much concerned or thinking about recurrence, just want to get back to feeling like the young 47 year old that I am. Question: the first time you had breast cancer, did you do chemo, rads, and hormone suppression, too?  I\u2019m sure you told us this before, but I can\u2019t remember. How\u2019s the new house? Has the cat got himself all acclimated? (I can\u2019t recall if you have just the one cat). Carol \u2013 So, how did the conference go?  Thanks for the card. The perfect end to my long week. I loved it! The picture was hysterical and your message so thoughtful. You are such a dear friend. Kathy \u2013 Thanks for popping in and for reminding me in your earlier post that our bodies were just thrown into menopause, so unlike most women who do this gradually, our bodies need time to adjust. Can\u2019t wait to hear about the little cuties and what they wore for Halloween. There was this adorable little girl, who was the Pillsbury Dough Boy. She had to be three. She had on gloves and waddled in her big costume to the door, put her bag down to pick out candy as her other hand had a sucker in it that she was sampling. Anyway, she had to really work to maneuver her hands with the gloves on to get the candy into her bag, then pick the bag up.  She couldn\u2019t lift it, and so dragged it across the lawn to the sidewalk where her parents waited. Such a cute picture, just made me laugh. Carla \u2013 Good to hear from you. Sounds like your work got into the spirit. We had lots of costumes yesterday at school. My boss dressed as a heavy set woman, and there was a small dog in the crack of her butt. He held up a sign that said, \u201cLost Dog. Have you seen her?\u201d and there was a picture of this stuffed dog. Hysterical. Glad you\u2019re seeing a counselor, and that you\u2019re taking care of yourself by putting aside some cash. So, it sounds like you\u2019ve got a goal of spring being the time to leave. New beginnings and spring go nicely together. I\u2019m just so proud of you for making the strides you\u2019ve made since all of this started. You\u2019ve become a more confident woman who knows what she wants for herself and her girls. WHOOHOO!!!!! From previous posts - Sherry, how are you doing with the knee and all? Kris60 - \"I see you\" (in response to peek a boo)...thanks for the HUG. Paula, hope all is well. Are you going to be able to see Carla and her girls? That's either this weekend or coming up, right? (See the mind just isn't what it used to be. Didn't you just tell us this a few posts ago?) Cathy - Have fun on your training walks today, and helping out with the float for the Rose Parade. Isn't raining in S.D.?   Speaking of S.D., haven't heard hide nor hair from Dana. She should have graduated, right? Was her cruise right after, or later? Jenn - Thinking of you gal.  Hope you check in and note that so many of us are feeling the blues and that we are here for you. Miss you: Dana, Jenn, Vettegal, Maz, Joan,  ARDeb, Sista, Wendy, and Tina. Check in when you can just to let us know how you are. Sorry to be so long winded. Have a great Saturday ladies.

Got lots of planning done for the next month. WhooHoo. Joan, I'll keep you and Jules posted about how well the intervention went in my 6th period class. Glad you checked in to let us know how you were doing.  Lucy's all ready to greet the new month of November, eh? CHJ- Thanks for the information on the TRAM. I'll tell her what you had to say.  I just read on another thread that a gal is getting lipo on her tummy, thighs, and butt to decrease fat cells since they produced estrogen, I guess. I'd not heard of this being an option. I wonder if that would be covered under insurance if it's for a medically sound reason?  I might just talk to my ps about that line of thinking.  I'm doing OK on losing my weight, but are the fat cells decreasing?  Getting smaller, but decreasing in number?  It's got me thinking. Have a great rest of the weekend. The sun is out today, and we're in for more rain this week. I'll be going to Monterey this coming weekend, so I may not be able to check in this week. I'll try to update you all on Kath after our appt. tomorrow with the surgeon. SIS ",

Dana and Paula, I'm going to shout out to you, though. Dana, I'm so sorry about your Dad, but know that you're going to get through this with the knowlege that your Dad was/is so very proud of you and your accomplishment.  You should be on your cruise right now, so I'm hoping you're having a great time. You so deservie it. Paula, I was bummed to hear about Ed, and hope that it's only his 'usual' seizure pattern. And get that heart palpation checked out. To all the other Jewels, forgive me for being a wimp and not shouting out. We end the trimester this Friday, so I've been really busy getting things graded and entered. I'm so disheartened again at the results of a reading test for two short stories we read. Too many failing it as if they weren't even present at our discussions of the stories. AHHHH!!!!! I'm hoping that their trimester grades will wake them up for the new trimester, where they start again fresh. Went to Carmel this past weekend. So, beautiful. Started with an overnight in Santa Cruz visiting some old family friends I've known since I was a kid. This couple is like my second parents. From there, it was on to Carmel Friday morning. I took the day off for a mental health day.  Went to a wine dinner Friday night- not great, and another on Saturday night- fabulous!!!!  Walked around Carmel, ate too much, and enjoyed the light rain.  I was dragging my butt yesterday at school, and today it's been all about grading. Whee! I will check in this weekend ladies.   And...I'm so glad the election is over.  I was doing the happy dance...such hope and history.  Our school did a mock election, and we predicted the outcome along with the electoral votes. Each class was a state...my class was Wisconsin.  I gave my kids the issues we could talk about and gave a brief this is what a yes vote would mean and what a no vote would mean. I was very factual. After they voted on the issues, they matched their votes to two columns. I revealed which candidate was the 'voter' in which column and explained they should vote for the person who agreed with them more often. We voted and gave our ten electoral votes to Obama at our rally.  It was a good lesson in my opinion. Take care all. SIS Kimberly PS Thanks SP for my journal. I love it.  Carla, loved the hat and card. I'll see my sis tonight to give her the card you sent along for her.  Thank you so much.  Carol, oh, baby smells- the good clean ones, not the poopy ones- are the best!  You'll be heading out to Arizona soon. I'm jealous.",

The 23rd was Greg's 50th ,so we were out to dinner with family, then for Christmas Eve we went to my twinsis' for our annual German meal, Beirochs. Greg made the dough from scratch...and it is then rolled out and cut into squares. Each square is then stuffed with a mixture of ground beef, cabbage, onion, salt, and pepper to taste. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, then baked for 20 minutes at 350. Yummy!!!!  For Christmas, we didn't open gifts until evening as my older sis couldn't get to the house until after 4pm.  We had fun exchanging our charity gifts and opening stocking stuffers, then ate a fabulous meal prepared by my dad and Greg...yogurt braised lamb and chicken...it was sooo good. I've had a lovely head cold for the past few days, but who cares...I'm not thinking about recovering from surgery or what chemotherapy is going to be like...WhooHoo!!!! I sent you all my New Years letter...Tina, I asked you where you've been and hoped you'ld check in, and look what I saw when I read the posts....one from you.  Good to hear from you. Norma, man, how lucky you are to have been so aware of those 'sores'. Glad you took yourself off the Tamox, and shame on your oncologists office for just 'guessing' it was a rash. Geez!!!! 70 degrees?  Man is our poor climate confused or what?  Glad you had a good holiday Paula. I'm all deChristmased, too.  The maid comes tomorrow, so I wanted to be ready for her, like CathyCA. So, Cathy, you and Carol are walking again next year!!! That's so great. Remind me when it gets closer you two, so I can send in my donation.  I'm a bit tapped out for a few months after the holidays.  Just wanted to let you all know that Kathleen is doing GREAT!!! She went back to work today part -time. We are going to spend the day together tomorrow starting around 10:30, so she's going to put in half a day by working for about 4 hours in the morning.  I told her not to push going back full-time if she can help it.   For those of you asking, I'm not sure when I'll do the complete hysterectomy. It will be laproscopic. I'll have a few small incisions in the abdomen and one inside the vagina, which does not sound too pleasant to me, but it sure beats cutting through muscle like in the old days, eh?  I may do it in April and back it up to my spring break, so I only have to take five days off, or I may wait until summer, maybe after the Jewels reunion and right before school. We'll see how things shape up. Kris, yippee for the drain removal. Is everything settled down now? No more leaks? How about your Jules...how are the nips looking? I know you're busy with family until Thursday, but let us know.  Have a wonderful Monday evening all. I'll check back in later in the week. SIS Kimberly ",

      "Content": "Jan 8, 2008 05:57PM - edited Jan 8, 2008 06:04PM by SISKimberly Wow, we certainly are a chatty group. D1/OLE and CarolC- Thank you for the compliment on my poetic musings. D1 - Lump...in Little Frankenboob? Could it be scar tissue? Getting it checked out is obviously the right thing...but question? Did you have a PET scan or Breast MRI? If I didn't have those, my surgeon stated they never would have known about the other two tumors I had. My mammo caught only one...and the ultrasound found it no problem...but when I asked that the Dr. do my underarm the ultrasound scan didn't catch the tumor under my arm because it didn't know exactly where to locate it, since it didn't show up on my initial mammo. The PET showed the other two...on at 7:30 and one in the axillary. The breast MRI confirmed the original tumor and the one at 7:30, but couldn't see the one under the arm because it couldn't see under my arms the way they positioned me. The surgeon stated that without those two tests, I would have had a lumpectomy. She felt the underarm tumor as soon as she knew where to locate it, but she had to press in pretty far to feel it. So, just want to make sure you were clear that your surgeon can only go by what info they are given...not that a second opinion isn't always a good option...just wanted to give the surgeon the benefit of the doubt. Hope your daughter has a good game tonight. Carol- You rock... I'll check out the website, then PM my order. I agree with D1/OLE that we need to include shipping and handling fees, so sending extra is a good idea. Sorry you're feeling under the weather...hope you are back in good form for Thursday. Vettegal-Glad to hear that you're reconsidering your work schedule. I'm just over a month out from surgery and still am shocked at how tired and sore my arms get. Where I had nodes removed took until about now to be able to lift that arm enough to really clean and shave....not that you'll be shaving with an inicision yet, but deodorant on either side of it should be OK. I agree about the washcloth and antibacterial soap helping to get any crusties taken care of...gently. Sorry to hear that you too are suffering from a cold or flu. Take care of yourself. Welcome Deb3Girls and Jenn 51- Carol as noted is not thrilled you had to join us, but happy to have some company on the Herceptin train. This is a wonderful group...you'll get so much out of it. CathyCA- Doesn't it feel great to finally have a plan? Not that you still won't have anxiety moments, but this has to be a big relief to at least have a direction. OK, now my news. Hope Deb did as well as I've seemed to do so far . Well, I made everyone smile with my Supergirl Cape and martini glass. The nurses filled my glass 6 times (keeping hydrated is good...get that chemical mix out of the system as soon as possible) while I was there, and other commented on my glass and how they wanted a chemotini too. HeeHee. I took about 2 hours and 45 minutes to get through my chemical mixture, so not too bad. Terrie, my older sister, was with me first half until about noon, and Kathleen, my twin, did the second half...they didn't have room for two guests at one time. So far...no SEs to report, though I don't think they'll kick in until day 3 if they are going to this round. The Neulasta shot tomorrow has its own SE's to contend with...but, personally I've signed on for the no SE's plan. I love you guys...thanks for your positive, wonderfully encouraging, and humorous responses. Your SIS Kimberly PS Good luck to all of you starting treatments or getting ports placed this week. Kathy L, I'm thinking about your Dad and tomorrow's heart surgery.",

I felt jittery and light headed on Decadron. Are you taking that? I take two pills twice a day the day before, the day of, and the day after my chemotinis. I also got a push of Decadron into my port after being flushed and before the cocktails began flowing. I too have heard the baking soda and salt rinse and Biotene toothpaste and mouth wash is good for mouth sores. Carol -I will go to the Tshirt website right after I post this and get right back to you with my size and address and all. LJ13- Good luck with round 2 tomorrow. D1/OLE is your round 2 today? If so, good luck with that. I have my next few dated: 1/29 10am chemotini, next day Neulasta and 2/19 10am chemotini, next day Neulasta. I guess I'll get the next few scheduled at the 2/19 appt. KathyL-So glad you enjoyed my poem and am tickled you have confidence that I'll be a famous author...hee hee hee...who knows...it could happen...another quircky perk of bc...like losing your hair, so you don't have to worry about shaving, or washing and styling your hair for a little while? LOL Of course you can steal my martini glass idea...pass on the fun. Chemotini's all around. Hey My3Girls-I recognize you from other threads. Thanks for stopping in and giving us the benefit of your wisdom and your support. Welcome Amy1971-Kathy L said it all. You've found a great group of gals here to share this journey with. Your feelings of anxiety are so normal...many of us have been there, and some are where you are right now. Once you've started, you'll be counting down. OK, so my signing on for NO SE's...there must have been a just kidding clause...So, I had a little nausea last night...the minestroni I had with Kath at lunch...being a little spicey...didn't end up setting well. Greg made dinner, salmon and vegies with bread and butter, and I ate very little except the bread and butter went down well...too much seasoning...I told him I need more bland for awhile...he was so sweet about it. I took my Decadron, a Compozine, and my Valium knowing that would knock me out for the night. Got up to pee several times, but went back to sleep. Up at 6am, drank my fiber and took my probiotics, emptied dishwasher, put laundry away, and cleaned the coffee pot with filter cleaner while my Ginger tea brewed. So far, slight nausea...not bad at all...just know I'll be eating small meals...slowly...and with very little seasoning. I think I'll try a little oatmeal for breakfast. Off to eat and get ready for my Neulasta shot. Are you doing one today, too, Deb? SIS(Sister In Survial) Kimberly",

DianeB- Thanks for checking in with us...good luck to you. D1- Glad you got that lump checked out...let's all just thing BENIGN... Jenn51- The shakes...do you have a fever? Or are you dehydrated. Drink lots of liquids and eat protein when you can. Feel better sweetie. Maz- You know, if we paid attention to all those things we read and hear...often contradictory...we'd starve. You've got to do what you feel is best for you, for sure. Cutting down sugar is always a good choice-cancer or not. I choose to eliminate processed foods and go for the whole foods, whole grains, and organic meats, fruits, and vegies. I am not a real sweets person, but I do indulge in dark chocolate pieces every now and again. OK, so I was awakened at 4am this morning, forced out of my nice warm bed to write down the words in my head, and then I spend the last hour giving this poem its voice. Man, these poems can be demanding. Lighten Up 1/18/08 Lighten up on life because there is no race to run. First place is not something you want to claim. Those things you are collecting, what a waste, will amount to nothing worthwhile, I guarantee, got no value like those dreams you never chased. All those hearts you\u2019re passing by without a thought, afraid they will distract you from your goal, are the gems of your journey slipping away because getting ahead is all you can see. \u201cPushing hard, can\u2019t look up, no time today.\u201d It\u2019s a trap, can\u2019t you see it there ready to swallow? It doesn\u2019t care if you Are at your most productive You\u2019re fair game as long as you choose to run the race. The myth has been woven into your \u2018should do\u2019 script. You didn\u2019t read between the lines; there are alternatives in place. There is still time, my friend, to make a change, if you will just stop long enough to hear. You can slow down, just take a deep breath in, and pay no mind to those who gain the lead because in the end, there is no big prize to win. Step off the racetrack you call your life and look up instead of at your feet. Take notice of what the world has to offer to you. See the faces of those who want only your time because its how you live and love that counts, not the job you do. Lighten up on life because there is no race to run. First place is not something you want to claim. Those things you are collecting, what a waste, will amount to nothing worthwhile, I guarantee, got no value like those dreams you never chased.

And Kathy, I love that show Heroes....too bad poetry can't save the world, but it can sooth the spirit, make one laugh or think about something in a different way. :-) I agree with Carol, you aren't a wuss at all. Everyone has different circumstances they have to deal with, and being around sick kids is not the best choice for you...nor me...I'm off for the duration, too. Sorry you aren't doing well today. Hope the hubby can keep the kids occupied so you can rest. (((HUGS)))) LJ13- You are a fountain of knowledge, girl! Great info on sugar and Carol's CMF tx. SheShe-Bummer about your head being so sore...no wonder you hair wants to leap out...it's uncomfortable. :-) Good luck on the shave. I'm not far behind. And thanks for the compliment on my poem. wvgirl- WhooHoo on your baldascousness and joining the very prestigious Balditude Club. How sweet of your bro to show up and show his support by shaving his head!!!! And, how nice was the hairdresser not to charge you? I'll bet when it started falling out in clumps, you dh didn't ask are you sure again. :-) Thanks for the kudos on my poem and for the info on the flouride. Guess I will have to call my dentist. I also need to get a good Calcium Vit D supplement. PALady- I totally get the whole head getting it and heart being on the fence thing. Being anxious is totally allowed. Glad you're feeling better...today. Vettegal- Hysterical about the clippers. I was cracking up reading it. And you are so right about all of us Jewels being precious!!! Yes, we are! CarolC- No apology needed. Sometimes it has to be 'all about me', and you've been through a huge life changing event here. Having the added stress of not knowing if you'll get the treatment you need is bound to send one over the edge. We're here for you, and I'll bet after the insurance company gets your doctors rationale for choosing the drug he did, they'll approve it. Carol- Thank you so much for getting the tshirts taken care of....you are the WOMAN!!!!! Love your new picture. Can you play? No way I can swing a club yet. I just started last summer, but enjoy it so much. OK, so I'm off to fold laundry and get something to eat. I won't tell you I hate the weather here today. It's not too bad temp wise here(upper 50s). I really do feel for you who are experiencing freezing temps....stay warm. Oh, Diana, you were posting at the same time I was. OMG, you poor thing. Hopefully, the new treatment will be easier on your system. I can't even imagine what you've been through...I am so sorry. ((((BIG HUGS)))))) SIS Kimberly",

Diana, I hope you're feeling better today, and that Carol's info on CMF eases your mind if that ends up being the treatment plan. The doctors anticipated the Cytoxan reaction, but your news about the allergic reaction to Taxotere...this is your second infusion and D1 had a reaction on the second infusion as well...is a little unnerving. I'm not liking that at all!!!! KathyL- Thanks for the info on Calcium and Flouride...I'm on that today! Sorry you're feeling so slow...listen to your body...it knows what you need. Just rest. The tea is Smooth Move, not Slow Move silly girl...although that was kind of funny, since it does feel like the digestive track is in slow motion. And good advice for CarolC. D1-I'm so glad I could bring a smile to your face! So, like Kathy, I'm glad you're just going to take it easy and rest. This is your second infusion, so how is it different than round #1 besides the reaction to Taxotere? I'm wondering if the effects are cummulative with each subsequent infusion, or if each time will result in a similar reaction as the previous one. So those of you in the cars in front of mine on this chemotrain...what's the consensus? Carol- Thanks for the compliment on the poem...and I'm all over the constipation prevention-tini. I bought the Miralax, so I'm ready to round #2 on the 29th. Lincoln is about 20 miles north of Sacramento. CarolC- I am so sorry that the SE's are staring to hit, but even more sorry that on top of everything, you have to worry about finances. It hardly seems fair that anyone has to even worry about money when dealing with medical crises. Kathy gave you some great advice. We'll all send out positive thoughts to the universe for a financial remedy for you. Sista-You're sounding chipper. Good to hear. Paula-Thanks for noticing that line as it was purposeful. Glad to hear you're doing OK as far as SE's so far. JulieK- Positive vibes going out your way!!!! Your teacher's union should consider proposing a sick leave bank. I'm so grateful that we have one. It's saving my butt. I'm glad you can borrow from next year, but where does that leave you if you need a day next year? Is the dock amount to pay the sub too much to consider since it will only be two or three days a month? How you doing Jenn51? With both D1 and Kathy needing to rest, a calendar of who is doing what this week will most likely not be available right away to send out the shout outs...so here's a general shout out to anyone who is starting chemo, doing their second round, waiting for test results, or their treatment plans next week...(((((HUGS))))) to you all.

CHJ-Great lyrics...I've not heard of Sara Groves...I'll have to check her out. Loved your misreading of Julie's pooped post. Cracked me up. ARDeb...OK, I so flunk geographic abbreviations...trying to keep our two Debs straight and moved you right to Arizona...sorry. The Tudors sounded like something about Shakespeare or something, but Henry the Vlll qualifies. Sista- I'm with you on feeling so lucky to have this group of gals to hang with on this journey. You're going to do fine...you have gotten great advice about to potentially expect and how to combat the possible se's...so go kick cancer butt!!! LJ13-Good luck to you as well! So, did you just find out your were HER2 positive or did I miss something? I wasn't sure since you asked for Herceptin to be added to your tx plan. D1-OMG, you crack me up...way to score on the wheelchair...and you totally brightened the day of those lab techs and your beach companion... CathyCa- What a studette you are!!!! Man, 4 miles...and I'm thrilled to get in 1 or 2. Billsgirl- Hey, where have you been? (I know reading, just not posting) Glad you let us know how you are doing. Glad to hear you tolerated round 1 well. Awesome mantra- FUBC....way easier than some sappy poem...doesn't your sis know about chemobrain? There is no way you could memorize...or recall it if you did manage to memorize it...once you get going on the chemotrain. ;-) Paula- I am so glad to hear things are 'calm' at your house. Way to go Mom...making dinner. Three cheers for MOM!!!! And doesn't that feel good to be ahead on the lesson plans? And another shout out to those fabulous teens of yours...it takes skill to leap between the \"all about me\" state of mind and the reality of your lives. Well done on the parenting! wvgirl-Aren't you rockin' the balditude!!! 80/60???? No wonder you almost fainted. My blood pressure is normally pretty low. Nurses who don't know me take it twice just to be sure, then ask if I'm an athlete...in my dreams, I'm an awesome figure skater...does that count? That always cracks them up. Dana- No need to apologize for having a pity party...totally allowed! I'm sure that your faith is not diminished in the least by being human. Glad to hear your 20% will be covered for 6 months by MediCal...that's excellent news. Good luck with your first infusion...you'll do just fine!!! Welcome Joan...starting just in the nick of time...glad you've already been reading our posts as we are quite the chatty group...so you know about the tshirts, right? Hey Jenny, I was wondering where you've been and how you're doing. Good luck tomorrow ...and you too Vettegal. Hopefully your boss will be understanding about time off if needed...can other employees give you a day of their time if they want? So, Jewels, yesterday, I went and got my wig fitted and cut. My sisters and hubby think it makes me look hot! HeeHeeHee. I still think I'll be au natural most of the time, but have this for events like Terrie's (older sister) belated birthday dinner at Ruth Chris' last night. Yummy meal, but not as good as Mortons. My poor hair is starting to leap off my head in herds, so I think I'm shaving it off this weekend. Called my gal to see if she's available Sat. If not, I'll have Greg (my hubby) do it. I'm so having pictures taken...thinking of shaving it off into funny styles like D1 did as we go...why not have fun, eh? My scalp literally hurts...so that saying \" I hurt all over, even my hair hurts\"-although I don't hurt all over- is true! Who knew losing your hair would be painful. And...hey...what's with starting my period today...36 day cycle...I was so hopeful at day 30 thinking whoohoo, I'm done with that whole thing....psych! What happened to chemopause? Geeze! Maybe the chemo perks are doled out slowly...wouldn't want to get overly excited too quickly. This month, you get to lose your hair- no styling worries, getting ready will be a breeze- and then next month chemopause. :-) I wonder what the prize is in March? I have my last \"fill-up\" this coming Monday and my second treatment on Tuesday. I'm a little anxious about the potential allergic reactions during the second infusion of Taxotere. Greg is going with me for this one, and I know the nurses are really good and will be on top it if I do have a reaction. I plan to ask them to do the drip really slowly at first to prevent that potential reaction. I've felt pretty darn good this week compared to the last two weeks...just in time to do this again next week...but knowing that I have two weeks to recoup between infusions is nice. I can't even imagine doing this every two weeks and having only one week to recoup. I still tire easily compared to before all of this, but I know that this is all temporary inconvenience. I can do this kicking cancer butt thing for the next six months or so. Take care of yourselves Jewels and know how much your love and support means to me. I couldn't get through this without you all. SIS Kimberly PS If anyone was posting while I was writing...sorry I missed ya.",

Carol-Hope you got some good rest...working full time and chemo...I'm thinking that can't be easy. Love the FUBC bracelet. WhooHoo AZDonna- I'll be shaving my head today at 10:15...in about three hours...Bold Baldacious Babe Bearing Brazen Balditude about to emerge...Sorry you're feeling ickey...hope a good night sleep helps. Judy-Good news all around!!!! ARDeb- I can so relate to not knowing where I am sometimes...I had to really think about which cupboard we keep the peanut butter in this morning...geeze. JKiss75- Bravo on your new boob. The good news is that you have all the time in the world to decide on reconstruction, and that's a good thing since you've got other things to think about right now. I have a wig for nice (and I feel really inconsiderate for not tipping...I didn't know. I will so do that when i go back in for my trim...I think I want my wig a little shorter. Anyway, my wig for 'going out' and just au natural the rest of the time. I got some caps and scarves to try out. PALady- Miralax once per day as directed worked for me. I'm sorry you and Vettegal were both up so early this morning, but at least you had the board to keep you occupied. Good luck to you and Vettegal this morning...and to all of you doing round 1 or round 2 today. Can you believe how quickly this week, this month is flying by? Next week is the last week of January already. Off to get ready for my date with Remington, SIS Kimberly",

Jenn51- Bummer about the weird taste...it doesn't last too long. Mine for about 4 or 5 days. And the gas problem- HELLO, The Damsel of Digestive Distress here. I finally got GasX as well. I'm ready for next week. And...when the scalp starts to get tingly and sore, be ready to see your hair on the floor. JulieK- Can't wait to see your pics. Hi Diana68- Glad to hear from you, but sorry to hear about your insurance company. Umm, don't we pay the premiums...and doesn't that mean we shouldn't have to fight for our coverage? SUCKS!!!! Get lots of rest and let those insurance people know who's in charge!!!! ARDeb- Bummer the treatment had to be postponed, but at least you didn't end up in the hospital. Take care of yourself so you can try it again next week with me. Welcome Jackie B- Glad you made it on the last Jan. Jewel train. I agree...hang with us since you're a Jewel...we're a great group. Kathy- You sound much better today. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you to be home on Sunday. Will you be able to prevent this kind of drop in the future? Hope that shower made you feel 100 times better....I know a shower always works wonders for me. And thanks for the kudos to teachers. Comments of appreciation are far and few between, so when teachers get them...they're like gold. D1- Well aren't you all full of vim and vigor? You sound good this morning. Good to hear your sparkle. Thanks for the calendar! Vettegal- Look at you!!!! Wow, love the balditude and that red hot wig. VaVaVoom! Sista- Thanks for the \"lookin' good\" shout out. I'll bet your bald head is going to look better than you think. Thinking of all my Jeweled Sisters...if you're suffering SE's...take care. If you're anticipating treatment 1, it's not as bad as you think...anticipation is so much worse. If you're on a 'good day or week' enjoy yourselves. Hey, Dana you must have been posted at the same time! Hopefully you get your treatment started next week...glad you're getting the PET and MUGA before hand. Lookin' forward to your balditude unveiling when the time comes. SIS Kimberly",

I would demand that the senior nurse do it next time....no more fooling around with newbies. And, I am so sorry about your husband not being the kind of support you need right now, but it sounds like you've known he wasn't \"all that affectionate\" from the get go. Sometimes men just need a little help. You might try, \" This is one of the hardest things I have ever had to deal with, and I what I could really use right now is a big hug from the man I love.\" Men need to know what they can do to f'ix it'. Just my two cents. WhooHoo on your daughter's making the Dean's list. That is quite an accomplishment. CHJ-Oh, that makes sense about the picture thing. So, Tamoxifin didn't stop your periods? If you're ER+, don't periods mean you're secreting estrogen, which isn't something we want? I was all over just having the periods stop. I'm 46, so maybe being later in my life's menstruation cycle, it will. Julie K- You seem very chipper this morning. Yea! Good luck with going back to work on Tuesday. I'll send out positive energy for you to keep those 'flu like' se's at bay. Dana- I just want to scream right now. What are they thinking????? Money, of course! I agree with CathyCA, you need to take action now. She gave you some great information. Don't wait for them to totally deny you coverage. I've also heard that Blue Cross has been under investigation numerous times for things like this. I would also consider letting your local paper or news station know what you're dealing with. We have a segment on our local news stations for consumers who are dealing with uncooperative companies, and they get action. Blue Cross doesn't want that kind of negative publicity. Diana63-Oh, you so didn't jump the gun on shaving your head....you took charge! By day 15 it was noticeable my hair was starting to fall out, but by Day 18- the day of my shave- it was falling out in handfuls. I'll be you look great!!! Vettegal- Have a great Sunday breakfast with the family. That is such a wonderful tradition that your kids will remember. I agree you need to keep on doing what you've always done if you can...and maybe try something new. PALady- Love your avetar pic. You're beautiful. Keeping ahead of the se's is exactly what I plan to do with round #2 this coming week. I think once you know how the body will react after round 1, it makes it easier to deal with the next rounds...that and all the fabu advice here. Take care gals. We're off to our favorite winery in Fair Play- El Dorado County- today to pick up our shipment and taste their newest release. I won't be tasting as much as I would normally of course, but at least week 3 has allowed me to taste wine- whoohoo!!! SIS Kimberly",

My dh took pics of me in my SuperGirl cape. I'll post as soon as I can get them uploaded to photobucket. Went to lunch at Red Robin, and while I was in the bathroom, he had the hostess tie a pink balloon to my seat. He's so cute! OK, so I've been working on a short story and this poem has been in the back of my head...since I had my head shaved...thought I'd share it with you. Baldacious Babe With Balditude 1/29/08 You know, I didn\u2019t really care when I found out I would lose my hair I knew it was only temporary and no, there is not one reason to get upset. I rather liked the novel notion of only needing soothing lotion on my newly baby bare legs, since no shaving would be required. The very thought of no hair was sublime just thinking about how much time I would save every morning with no blow drying or styling. The reality came in only eleven days and in such unexpected ways, for at first my hair leapt unannounced no real traces to be found, but feeling thinner. On day eight, my sore scalp threw off strands; they came out right in my hands! It wasn\u2019t a lot, but Wow no denying my hair was a changin\u2019 The very next day, a wig would be found to wear out on occasions when my bald mound might be \u2018out of place\u2019, or I just wanted to look HOT! No reason to limit my head covering potential. On day eleven, hair now everywhere, we did the big shave. What a blast we had; my Mohawk was all the rave! The star of Hoshalls Salon for at least the day; no way they\u2019ll soon forget that crazy lady's new do. I feel strangely empowered and wonderfully free like I have broken a stereotype I had of me I am not my breasts, nor my hair. No, those things are not what matters! It\u2019s my confidence. My boldly looking Cancer in the eye And saying with conviction, \u201cI don\u2019t even care why\u201d What I know is I am gonna kick your sorry behind, NO mercy granted, \u2018cause I\u2019m one baldacious babe with baldtitude. Yep, having a new Balditude is what matters! SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Feb 7, 2008 11:57AM - edited Feb 7, 2008 12:05PM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, I slept well last night, and went for a walk this morning\u2026that felt good, then started reading the threads I usually read. I\u2019ve been following on one of the forums a man who lost his wife. He posted that he was lonely and was thinking about dating. He and his wife had talked about her wish that he move on and find love again. Anyway, he\u2019s such a sweet guy and loved his wife dearly (over 30 years married). He posted throughout her diagnosis, surgeries, treatments, and eventual nothing more we can do prognosis, hospice, and her death. Someone was offended by his post regarding his thinking about dating, like it was their right to judge him, and had his post deleted even though it didn\u2019t meet the requirements for a post that should be deleted. I was shocked. I was also disheartened at how some women could attack him and those of us who support his choice to live his life as he and Diane discussed. Made me soooooo grateful to have all of you Jewels\u2026knowing we can express whatever we need to without fear of being attacked and judged. Vettegal- You crack me up, and I just about fell off my chair when I read the oral sex comment\u2026hysterical!!!! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re feeling so good. Keep taking advantage of that feeling\u2026and hey, maybe the hubby will get lucky. HaHaHa Kathy- Well, when you only have four chances to make an impression nothing says\u2026I\u2019m a fun gal, like turning red and not breathing LOL. I\u2019m sorry you had a reaction\u2026but like you said, the upside is the sleep benefit of Benedryl. I\u2019m so glad I expressed the reaction concern about round #2 and asked up front for my Taxotere to be dripped really slowly for the first 20 minutes. The onc nurse totally humored me as she said people usually react to the first dose, not the second. I told her that we had at least three on our site that reacted to the second\u2026now I\u2019ll tell her we had another. There may be something to this slow drip thing. Hope you got a good night\u2019s sleep and this weekend is kind to you. Carol- You look great!!!! I\u2019m with you on being a computer non-geek. Notice my Super Girl pics still haven\u2019t been posted. And how enlightened are you to still have such a wonderful relationship with your ex\u2019s mother!!!! That is how it should be\u2026you might divorce the man, but the relatives still need to be in the life of the kids and the spouse. It\u2019s so important for kids to know that just because Mom and Dad can\u2019t live together anymore, that doesn\u2019t change that everyone still loves them. I\u2019ll bet you and your ex are friends, too. BRAVO!!!! And, no you weren\u2019t imagining being tired\u2026low blood counts really do affect your energy level. What a lovely way to spend the afternoon sleeping in front of the fire (like your dogs sprawled in the sunshine\u2026great image\u2026). Get lots of rest and gear up and stay ahead of those potential se\u2019s. The onc\u2019s just one thing at a time answer doesn\u2019t surprise me at all\u2026and I\u2019m with you. I will be advocating for that when I\u2019m done with rads. Whatever I can do to keep the estrogen at bay, I\u2019ll do. I know surgical menopause may not be easy, but if chemo sends us eventually into a menopause like state, then we\u2019ll have some experience with what it will be like, right? \u201cAlso, Kimberly, remember that ibu tonight!\u201d\u2026OK, you\u2019ll be me as in not sleeping? I\u2019m feeling really dense right now, Carol. Paula- I love the picture!!!! How great that you and your students shared that experience. My students had the same reaction\u2026hard for them to see me without hair\u2026means I\u2019m sick\u2026but I told them that it means I\u2019m getting well!!!! D1- Here\u2019s to a better time with se\u2019s since the infusion went better. CarolC- The wig looks good, but if you get the wig cut and trimmed to fit your face\u2026you may like it better. Also, make sure the wig fits properly. If not, have it tucked. You look good with no hair\u2026you\u2019re right\u2026we are all just darn good lookin\u2019 gals!!!!! Joan- So glad things are looking up today\u2026let\u2019s keep that momentum going through the weekend and just skip those se\u2019s that usually arrive day 3-5. Jackie- Glad you seem to be on your hump day, and heading into the downhill slide. Yeah, the taste bud thing sucks, but gets better before the next tx. CHJ-Oh, I\u2019m sorry you got sick\u2026and with something that makes you throw up\u2026how ironic. The good news\u2026thankfully you didn\u2019t get this the day after chemo. Your body will be able to recoup much faster now than it otherwise would have. I know you\u2019re disappointed. Tina- Hey, I don\u2019t know what the benefits are to doing it all at once or separated the way you\u2019re doing it. It could be the protocol a medical group has agreed upon based on the facts in each case. I know that my medical group has \u2018breast conferences\u2019 to discuss cases. My surgeon, plastic surgeon, and others were there. Mine was one case that was brought to the group. So, I\u2019m thinking that as a group they decided based on the facts of my case that I\u2019d have the kind of surgery I had (bilateral skin preserving mastectomy with expanders placed) and that I\u2019d have chemo and radiation plus hormone suppressing drugs down the line. LJ13- WhooHoo on the last AC!!!!! I can understand taking Herceptin at low doses over a longer period if there\u2019s a risk for heart issues. I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll have a MUGA scan after I\u2019m done, too. I certainly will request it if my onc doesn\u2019t mention it. Julie-Good to hear you\u2019re comin\u2019 out of the fog. Hope you get your list accomplished, but do listen to your body\u2026conserve your energy for healing. Dana- Oh Darlin\u2019, have you heard about the power of positive intention/attraction? What you put out into the universe, you get back. Don\u2019t envy the money or harbor the belief that things came easier to others than to you. If you think and say you\u2019re a victim\u2026 then that\u2019s what you attract. If you don\u2019t like where you\u2019re at in life\u2026change it. You are not a victim\u2026you are a survivor!!!! If you haven\u2019t read anything on the power of positive attraction, do so. It really is amazing what a difference attitude can make. You\u2019ve brought into your life the lessons you need to learn\u2026and they are blessings even if they aren\u2019t easy. I know it\u2019s easier said than done, but it starts with the intention to change what you put out. Create for yourself a list or a picture board of everything you really want in your life. Make positive heart felt choices and state them in positive ways. Look at it everyday and say to yourself, I\u2019m willing to change and am open to learn. I deserve to be happy and loved. By the time you graduate in October, you will be so much happier, and I\u2019ll bet grateful your boyfriend put you on notice. Sometimes the universe has to kick us in the butt to wake us up and get us on our rightful path\u2026it\u2019s been hard because it isn\u2019t the right path for you to be with him\u2026but you already knew that. We are here for you, Sweetie. Lots to catch up...sorry for my long windedness. Hope treatments are going well for CarolC, LJ13, DianeB, Maz,, CarolC, Tina, AZDonna, and Sista SIS Kimberly",

I am not saying that we control every aspect of life with our attitude\u2026I\u2019m saying we can change our situation by sending out positive rather than negative, so we attract more of what we want. In no way I am saying that people who are in countries starving or people who become ill deserve it\u2026no one deserves negative things in their life\u2026that is not what life was meant to be about\u2026it is about being grateful everyday and how we handle what life gives us as you said. I also did not intend to minimize your efforts to get your education by getting your degree and helping others\u2026that is a huge positive step towards the life you deserve. My intention was to remind you that bad things happen to all kinds of people, but it is how we react to those things that makes the difference\u2026which you stated in your post.:-) Being a victim gets people nowhere\u2026and I understand you were venting. I\u2019m not saying people should never have a bad day, it is just that what you were saying was deeply felt\u2026not something that was a passing whim. I know that kind of hurt. I\u2019ve been there (abuse, alcoholic Dad \u2013now sober and awesome- making bad choices in relationships because of the abuse, feeling like I wasn\u2019t worth much, and feeling so put upon by life\u2026etc.), and it wasn\u2019t until I took control of my own thinking and started to make changes that life became sooooo much richer for me. I just wanted to remind you that you\u2019re a survivor, not a victim in this life. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve got a plan in place, that you\u2019ve ordered a book on positive thinking, and wish you nothing the best.

      "Content": "Feb 9, 2008 10:21AM - edited Feb 9, 2008 10:23AM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, So, I had a long day yesterday. I went to school to get some paperwork done and to have lunch with the gang. Great catching up with everyone. Then I took myself to see Bee Movie at the $3 movie, walked the Mall, and then met my son, dh, and sisters for Sushi at our favorite Japanese place. I taught the owners son, his now wife ( went to their wedding), and other members of the family English when I taught adult night school, oh so many years ago, for fun. They had one restaurant then, which has now expanded to take over the entire building plus another building on site. They\u2019ve also expanded to a total of 7 restaurants- one in Vegas. My son has been going since he was young and says, \u201cGee Mom, you had a hand in helping them reach their American Dream\u2026\u201d Hmmm, I guess in a small way, I did. That made me feel pretty good. Anyway, I had a nice day\u2026gotta take advantage of those for sure. D1- So glad you\u2019ve crawled back to us out of the fog, and hope that it doesn\u2019t envelope you too badly over the next 72 hours. We \u2018ve missed you, and totally understand laying low. No way you\u2019ll be dealing with the Conspaty\u2026you\u2019ve got preventative measures on hand\u2026Mirilax\u2026that miracle laxative. I\u2019ve been using Vaseline up the ole nose\u2026don\u2019t know if I\u2019d like the baby diaper rash prevention smell more or less than the lovely aroma of Ode de Oil Refinery or not. It\u2019s a toss up. Whoohoo on the extra PT and the Lymphodema appt. The sleeve for flying I hear is a good thing to have on hand\u2026I\u2019m thinking a flight to somewhere tropical would be good. Dana- That\u2019s great about the insurance saying OK to the onc. How could they logically turn you down for chemo after saying OK to him? I think, not. You\u2019re going to be covered\u2026I just know it. And if I\u2019m wrong\u2026which is a possibility (hahaha), then I\u2019m throwing my tax dollars your way, darlin\u2019. Side Bar- When I was in college, I had my son, and I was on Medical and Family Assistance. I got loans to pay tuition, daycare, and books, and the County cut off my food stamps and told me they\u2019d cut my assistance in half because they considered my student loans income. I was outraged. I sued them and won. I explained to the judge that my two more years in college will assure me of a job that will help me to be a tax paying citizen. The County was basically telling me that a loan, which I have to pay back, and which is paying my school expenses, not buying me luxuries, is income. That is not logical. The County was also saying that going to school and getting an education wasn\u2019t important because if they cut my assistance, I\u2019d have to use that loan money to cover that loss, which meant I can\u2019t afford to pay childcare, which means no school. It appeared they\u2019d prefer I stay on Family Assistance instead. Made no sense to me, nor the judge apparently. That was an awesome day!!!! Vettagal- Or shall we call you Speed Racer\u2026I\u2019m sorry, I admit I laughed at your neighbor wanting to talk as you squeezed those butt cheeks together\u2026hey, a silver lining\u2026you probably got a good butt workout with that isometric squeezing you were doing. I am\u2026and I\u2019m sure everyone who would have been in your car later is\u2026 so glad you made it just in time. How about a cruise? With a big group, we could easily get a discount if we contacted the cruise line directly. What fun that would be to get a big group photo!!!! I,too, would cherish that!!!! Dana- WOW, I just read your post about the liver. They think\u2026so they aren\u2019t sure? And your previous docs saw this on your CT scan and didn\u2019t think it was a concern? So either they were clueless or your new onc is being cautious and wants to be sure it isn\u2019t something to worry about. Of course, you said only the nurse said something to you\u2026so maybe she\u2019s speaking out of turn? How can you know for sure? Do they biopsy a liver? Won\u2019t chemo going through the liver kill those cells if it is cancer? I\u2019m so sorry that you got such news right after your good insurance news, but like all the other gals have said\u2026it could be nothing. You have the right attitude\u2026just Let Go and Let God as the saying goes. We love you and will be here for your even if when your chemo is still going and we\u2019re done\u2026many of us have rads afterwards\u2026then hormone therapy\u2026us Jewels are going to be talking and supporting eachother for a long time girlfriend. ((((HUGS))))) Maz- I have a Mac, too. I can\u2019t get my pics up either. The dh has to do it with his PC. Another beautiful baldacious babe has joined the ranks. Carol- Glad the dh is bringing you dinner. No need to cook when you\u2019re feeling wiped out. Feet up, fire going, and the Jewels\u2026just the perfect pick me up, eh? Thanks for doing the t-shirt reorder. And again, I have a large that I tried on once, washed, and tried on again that is too big for me if anyone wants me to send it to them. My gift. Julie-That\u2019s great that you ended up doing more than you planned with your son, and that you made it through without too much trouble. Kind of sucks though that you\u2019re just starting to feel good, and it\u2019s time to do it again next week. Hopefully, they\u2019ve got this down now, and you won\u2019t have the same awful time with throwing up and all. CarolC- So, things are still going along OK for you in the se dept. it sounds like. Try taking Extra Strength Gas X in the am and pm\u2026really helped me with the gas. I\u2019m also taking a probiotic to replace all those little bacteria in my gut each morning. Oooo, Sedona sounds nice. CHJ- I am so sorry that you\u2019ve been so sick. How are your lunch buddies doing? Hopefully, you\u2019re on the tail end of this thing\u2026and yeah, it is ironic to want to feel well enough to have chemo\u2026but the good news is that if won\u2019t feel like what you just went through. Take care of you\u2026 (((HUGS)))) Here\u2019s to an SE-lite day for those of you in the throws of the chemo climb\u2026and to an energy filled day for those of you on the downhill slide gearing up for the next round. I PM\u2019d Herch and asked if she might have mistakenly posted here as I have not heard of a Diana4 on this thread. SIS Kimberly",

I love a good dark chocolate once in awhile, which still tastes good to me, but wine until the end of the third week isn't good at all. I tried a taste of the Syrah at dinner with the girls before the ballet on Sat. night, and it wasn't good...not that it wasn't good...my taste buds didn't like it...so sad.

Sorry you got hit by a lack of energy yesterday\u2026isn\u2019t it weird that it just hits like that out of the blue after feeling pretty good? I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s what happened to me the past few days\u2026feeling good just not as energetic. Appears today is a better day. I wake up as if I\u2019m going to work still, so I\u2019m thinking that could account for your waking at 5am this morning. How sweet of the shop you work with to send a care package\u2026leggings with lace eh? Hope you find something wonderful for the dh. I have no clue\u2026plan to make dinner, have a card, but a gift\u2026not yet. Jenn- I still maintain you\u2019re a SHERO\u2026and your dh is definitely in line for a gold star!!!!! So, when you\u2019re down, how does your dh get to work being legally blind? Bringing home payroll suggests you guys own your own business\u2026what do you guys do? Julie-I\u2019m so sorry that you had another migrain. Bless the dh for giving you your shots and hopefully keeping the kids occupied while you deal with your mirgrain. If it is a snow day, why is your principal at school, and why would you try to drive an hour to meet with him? Driving isn\u2019t recommended on snow days is it? I used to live in Alpine Meadows in Lake Tahoe, and my mom was a principal at the time, and one day we couldn\u2019t get the cars dug out and the plows hadn\u2019t made up to us yet, so she snowshoed to the main road,which had been plowed,\u2026a good couple of miles\u2026.talk about dedication. I promise, I\u2019m really not doing that much at all these past few days. D1- There are some very good Pinots and Merlots out there for sure\u2026have you tried chocolate and a good Syrah? That too is delightful. I\u2019m more of a red girl\u2026have to have a nice hot day for white\u2026although a good buttery Chard can be wonderful with a light salmon meal. I tried an Italian red last night, which I could taste\u2026.yeah!!!! It was an Alianigco (sp). Hey Denise- Welcome\u2026and you are too fun!!! You\u2019re so going to fit in to our group. I would like to suggest you take an afternoon and put that novel down and read our thread from the beginning. You will get more advice about heading off the se\u2019s than you can shake a stick at. We\u2019ve all done the digestive distress, lack of sleep, blahblahblah\u2026and the list goes on. You\u2019ll also get a good laugh along the way. We have tshirts, too, which you\u2019ll read about, so make sure to order one. Kathy-About the depression, we certainly will be here for each other even after chemo and rads is over\u2026there\u2019s a slew of us who will be doing HT (and that has a whole list of potential se\u2019s to discuss and get through) and those doing Herceptin, which must have se\u2019s\u2026and if we do experience that let down\u2026which I understand\u2026going from the known to the unknown again. I can\u2019t imagine not being online with all of you Jewels even after we return to our new \u2018normal\u2019. Once again\u2026you were just getting stuff done yesterday, girl\u2026and in bad weather! Bummer that this morning your digestive track has taken a turn. Hopefully, it\u2019s just a delayed se, or something you ate, and not a virus. Sorry you\u2019re on your own with the kids this afternoon and evening when you\u2019re feeling ucky. Maybe you\u2019ll feel better by this afternoon. Sista- Hey, sorry tx2 knocked you on your butt. It did me, too. I\u2019ve craved things, too. I really like eggs more than usual. I craved white rice with butter and tuna. Welcome to the baldacious babes club. I agree that having Jewels ahead of you in treatment is so helpful\u2026thanks D1 for being ahead of me. :-) So, how much does the tooth fairie pay these days? Kris- Are you on a steroid high? You\u2019re sounding really great!!!! New hardwood in the bedroom\u2026nice! Too funny about pulling the hair out in front of the dh. Yep, it\u2019s almost time to do the big shave, girlfriend. Hope you don\u2019t need antibiotics this time around. Hey, I wonder if that\u2019s the same semi that hit me after my tx2? Get back under those covers and just take it easy. CarolC-OK, I so don\u2019t want to deal with red, itchy, peeling skin and sore feet. I\u2019m sorry your have to deal with that SE. Hope you got a few extra winks after your post and are feeling up to another day at work. Paula- So glad you got a relatively good night\u2019s sleep. You\u2019re still working being sick? Speaking of work\u2026you do have a great work place\u2026that\u2019s so cool everyone wearing hats in your honor, and how appropriate to get an edible basket since you craved fruit after tx 1 and can use the good vitamins now. ARDeb- Well that sucks\u2026being tired and now dealing with with the runs\u2026it seems we are faced with the extremes, eh? I\u2019m with you on wondering about the cumulative effects\u2026I was worried about 6, but you have 8. Hang in there. SIS Kimberly",

Either way, I know it didn\u2019t feel good to hear that\u2026it was probably hard not to think,\u201dSo, I looked like c#*p before? Thanks!\u201d Personally, I like the way I look in my wig better than my \u2018normal\u2019 hair. Baby fine hair didn\u2019t style well, and my wig looks stylin\u2019 all the time. So, when I\u2019m not sportin\u2019 the balditude, the wig is a great alternative\u2026something I might even wear after my hair comes back. I knew I had to talked to someone last week about a trial and triple neg. Whew, the brain worked! Carol- Sorry for the scare, but glad your DVR worked. I wasn\u2019t trying to record the concert, I\u2019ve seen Celine in concert, and she\u2019s great. I was trying to record Lost and Eli Stone, which is why we had to watch it using our media computer with the TV as the monitor. Vettegal- I am so sorry that you seem to be having such a bad time with chemo. Good thing you\u2019ve got such a great dh to help you out. Take care and get lots of rest sweetie. ((((HUGS)))) Kathy-WHooHoo to feeling really good!!!! You don\u2019t have that issue of having to wait in line to enroll your child in kindergarten do you? Man, in our area it\u2019s crazy\u2026people stand in line for hours before the school even opens. It\u2019s all about attendance areas and not wanting your child to be bussed due to overcrowding. I like the idea of writing a book about the experience of the Jewels. My sister gave me a book about four gals who were doing treatment together and met an Nordstroms at Noon, thus the book\u2019s title, to share their experiences and to support eachother. Haven\u2019t read it yet. LJ13- Man, you gals and your respiratory infections\u2026knock on wood, I haven\u2019t so much as caught a cold. My stuffy head last week was probably an se\u2026it was gone in a few days. I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019re done with this viral infection sooner rather than later\u2026it so sucks to be sick when you already don\u2019t feel 100%. Take care of yourself again today\u2026I think with the fever\u2019s retreat, you\u2019ll be doing much better by Tuesday. Jenn- I wish I could send you some sunshine\u2026 spring is on the way\u2026hang on. Love the glasses lament\u2026I forget I have no hair to hold up my sunglasses, too. I wear readers for reading\u2026haven\u2019t gone in for my eye exam as I was told\u2026as D1 is discovering\u2026chemo could effect my eyesight as far as my prescription\u2026not sure why, but I\u2019ll go this summer once chemo and rads are done. CHJ- Ditto what I said to LJ13\u2026I can totally understand breaking down and just wanting a few days of feeling decent before having another infusion. ((((HUGS)))) Terese- I\u2019m so glad you are feeling good\u2026and bummed you have to be around all the sickies in your house\u2026lots of hand washing. Good deal that you can go back to work in April. That\u2019s my last month of chemo. So, no radiation for you, then. That\u2019s good\u2026you\u2019ll be back to a more \u2018normal\u2019 routine pretty soon. Well\u2026I\u2019m all caught up for now.

It was a long day...thanks to all the Decadron in my system...but I'm crashing right now. I've spent some time staring into space today...and more lately than usual. Anyway, I have to take my second dose of Decadron...even though I took it this morning and got an extra dose in the IV, when I'm done here. I will be taking the Valium...and hope for a good night's sleep. Have fun shopping at Nordies for a new boob and bras. D1- Wow, you're growing hair back already? That's great. I suppose if I didn't shave the nubs to avoid the velcro thing, I might have hair growing, too maybe... but I want to wait until I'm done with chemo to let my hair grow back without all that stuff in my body...of course I've read rads might hinder the growth as well. Dana- Hope your MRI went well. I'm reading a really good book called A New Earth...and it talks about the shift of consciousness that humanity is starting to realize needs to take place...the shift prophets like Jesus knew about long ago and tried to convey, but their teachings were misinterpreted because it scared those in power.... Kalen- I too have not experienced issues sexually, except not being so energetic or the one that's initiating...except on Valentines Day...:-) My dh is so wonderful, so I set the mood and acted as if I was a sexy red headed siren...it worked. I do know that some women start to lose their ability to lubricate, and that KY is a good solution. Mom2Daughters- I had my bilat on 12/6 and started chemo 1/8. You'll need a little time to heal before starting chemo since chemo hinders healthy cell growth as well as kills cancer cells. I had the PET and MRI before surgery and the EKG right before surgery. The PET found two more tumors...one in the axillary lymph nodes, so that took the lumpectomy choice off the table, the placement of implants in favor of expanders instead knowing I'd now have to do radiation, and determined my three drug cocktail as opposed to two. I know how much yhou just want to get this party started...but don't feel you need to rush...get all the information you need first. Ok gals...gotta go. I'll check in tomorrow morning.

Man, it seems like such a long time ago that my Jon was that age\u2026almost 20 years ago (he\u2019ll be 25 in August). He\u2019s moving to Rocklin again, into the investment house, and he tells his girlfriend every time he passes La Petite Academy that it is where he went to Kindergarten. Must have been a good experience in his mind\u2026and it was a great place. Up at 2:30am\u2026needed to pee, or just wanted to be with mommy? I remember when Jon was finally potty trained\u2026what a huge relief. Have fun today with your girlfriend. SheShe- I\u2019ll email you and get your address, so we can get you your very own Jan. Jewels shirt. Hey, I\u2019m sorry I totally skipped mentioning your daughters wedding in August. The flowers and dresses sound beautiful. Congrats to her and to the mother of the bride. Ok, what is Verners\u2026a soda pop like drink? Weird about the allergic reaction to the prosthesis being made of latex and silicone. Has extra padding in the one side of your bra been tried yet? If that doesn\u2019t work, will you do a reconstruction down the line? Carol- Loved the pics. I\u2019m so pleased that you had such a great time with your friend, made the day of your fitter, Ashley, and found exactly what you were looking for\u2026Look Good Feel Good, eh? Hope your dinner outing went well and that your tummy cooperated. All that boob excitement got the gastric juices flowing. Oh, got my medium shirt yesty, and it fits so much better. Thanks. Kris- Sounds like a reaction to the Nasty Lasta to me. Bummer. If the Tylenol doesn\u2019t touch the pain, call your doc for something stronger\u2026unless you have leftover surgery pain meds you could try. (((gentle HUGS)))) Hope the pain doesn\u2019t last too long. Glad things settled down around 5am. Great pic of the gang at work. That is so great that so many are supporting you. An aircraft mechanic\u2026wow!!!! Crawling around in small places around an aircraft in pain won\u2019t be a good thing, so getting stronger meds will help if you should need to be at work soon. Get lots of sleep today. Spoke too soon. Oh, man up at midnight and in such pain\u2026I\u2019d be calling my doctor today and getting something to stop the spasms/pain. No one should have to deal with that kind of pain. ((((more gentle hugs)))) Dana- Oh my darlin\u2019, I\u2019m so sorry that you got cancer in the liver news, but like Kathy said once you have the biopsy it will let you know if it\u2019s bc spread or a different cancer. You\u2019re right, it will be good to know going into chemo treatment what you\u2019re up against, so you and your new oncologist can have the best plan in place to treat you. And\u2026taking the dogs out for a walk to get fresh air is also a good way to take care of yourself. You\u2019re in my thoughts sweetie. ((((HUGS)))) Sounds like you\u2019re getting a lot from your new book. I\u2019m glad it is bringing you comfort. Paula- Man, that virus is just not willing to let you go. Glad the Nyquil is working to at least help you sleep and that you got grades and lesson plans done. Hope you slept well last night and feel much better in the AM. The good news is you are at least on the downward slide feeling just tired and not 100%, and not like death warmed over anymore. D1- Glad you got a kick out of the floating boob story\u2026sounds like dear Carol has a swimming boob\u2026will that fit into a special swim suit, or will your own suit be fitted with a pocket\u2026a secure pocket. About your license plate\u2026bummer others have stolen our acronym. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve tried using those symbols in a variety of combinations already. Beat It might be appropriate since you\u2019ll have the plate longer as a survivor than someone curing the diagnosis and treatment phase. Joan- Welcome to the half way mark\u2026me too. Take care of you\u2026and hoping your se\u2019s are easy on you. Yes, I\u2019ve heard of Rieki. My cousin is getting trained. It\u2019s supposed to be good for moving chemo through the system, treating swelling, and helping scar tissue be broken down, I believe. Can you give us the link to what you\u2019ve been reading? Tina- WhooHoo on the new puter\u2026and I second the blessings of being married to a geek. Good luck today, and glad to hear that you got a good third week after your last tx\u2026let\u2019s hope this last AC is just as cooperative. Hey Wendy- Sound like things are going well for you, since you only did shout outs. Excellent! PALady- I\u2019m sorry your tx 3 has been the worst so far\u2026hope that doesn\u2019t foretell how my tx 3 done Tuesday is going to go. Of course, unlike you SHERO, I don\u2019t have little ones to get ready for school and take care of daily. It\u2019s two days after tx 3, and so far nothing so horrible I can\u2019t deal with rest and preventative pharmaceuticals. Take care sweetie. Glad the composing in word was a helpful idea for you. If I\u2019m up to it, I\u2019ll be going to school today for a big Roseville Teacher\u2019s Union meeting regarding our contract and the district offering us 0% this year. The district is claiming they need to keep the COLA money given to the state to use next year to deal with the big budget cuts next year. The District already has a 7% emergency type fund for things just like next year\u2019s potential budget cuts. We are only required to have 3%. We worked really hard last year to get the district to give us COLA, which we reminded them wasn\u2019t a raise, but a cost of living increase. Many of our teachers made less take home the year prior due to the higher cost of out of pocket health care costs, and we won the full COLA last year. This year, we understand the problems, and we aren\u2019t greedy, but we can\u2019t except nothing with health care increasing again this year. Other than that\u2026I\u2019m taking it really easy today. Take care Jewels. SIS Kimberly",

I didn't make it to my meeting, so hopefully will get an update from my dear friends later. I've read all the posts, but just can't get the energy up right now to give the shout outs except to Deb, so sorry about your dp mother. Take care all...have a good weekend. SIS Kimberly",

Even with the very drunk (cheap wine and rum and coke...can you say icky hangover on a work night?) row mates talking loudly (what is it about alcohol that make people think everyone around them are deaf?) throughout songs they didn't dance to and bothering everyone around them, \"Come on, get up and dance', it was so great to be there with my dh, my sisters and my best bud and her dh. I did take a nap before getting ready, then headed out around 5:00pm to meet everyone for dinner beforehand. I slept all the way home. Today, I have an appt. with the plastic surgeon, my labs, and must mail two packages. One for Sherry- your tshirt and one for my twins dear friend whose mother passed on Monday afternoon after a long battle with cancer. That ought to do me in. D1- I'm so glad that you pt is such an advocate for you, and it doesn't hurt she gives a good butt massage either, eh? I hope the wrap works to control the swelling. Go kick some cancer booty today. Kathy- Good info from your onc. Glad it made you feel better about tx#3. Wow, another ICU nurse, and pediatrics at that. My hats off to both you and Therese...a belated thank you from mankind for having been on the front lines, and the ones who help pull us through or gently let us go. Grab on tight to D1 and Maz and jump...    Note to both of you and D1, I updated my chemo dates in my earlier post, was that noted? Julie- I know that the Academy Awards were Sunday night, but there is no category for most accumulated se's or most days down for the count. Between you and Vettegal, I think we've got everything covered except neuropathy and lymphodema, which CarolC and D1 have taken on for the group. I'm sorry you were a blue jewel yesterday, and hope that tomorrow brings you more energy. Thanks for sharing you enjoy my writing. That makes me feel good...like I was able to help some.  Hope that Imatrex kicked in. Deb- I am so sorry for you and your dp, but so grateful to hear that her mom's passing was relatively quick and painless. WhooHoo on the last of your AC!!!!! Half way there!!!! I couldn't agree with D1 more that your dp's mom will show up in wonderful and unexpected ways to let you know she's with you guys. I love the idea of the blue sapphire and diamond thing...a testament to the journey. Not too mushy at all. I also love that new show, Dexter. I loved watching the main character in Six Feet Under as well. Sherry- I am sooooo excited for you that your new Cancer Center and oncologist are awesome!!!! Your choice to take charge did save your life...your quality of life, too. And, heck no you don't mushy saying the Jewels are our light at the end of the tunnel, or imagining our friendships will last a life time. Just because we finish treatment and move on with the new normal doesn't mean we can't check in with each other...so many gals on this site have been corresponding for years and even have annual reunions in different parts of the country. Can't wait to Happy Dance with you...I've got tap shoes, you know! Vettegal- There's our funny LOL, girl!!! Welcome back!!!! OK, so I have this picture in my head of you preparing in advance a lounge chair, beach blanket, and small table with a suntan lotion and a drink with an umbrella in it (maybe Carol's Cranberry Miralax cocktail with a little too much Miralax in it...OK, just kidding, but it would serve him right) in the boss' office (maybe a coworker would help you out?). You greet him dressed in a hula skirt,a long blonde wig, and of course some bronzer, then offer him a menu of side effects you've suffered while he's worried about the bottom line...oh, that could be a pun directed at the Big D, but let's not go there... and then pull off the wig in front of him stating, \"I'd like to see you pull this off without missing any time at work.\" Answer to both questions: Yes and Yes. I take Pepcid AC twice a day (am and pm)from the day before tx through day 6 or so, and then as needed. Paula- Oh man, when you hit the Jim Beam straight, it has got to be bad. I'm so sorry that you're not going to get a break before tx#4. Hope you got some sleep last night. Hey PALady- Sounds like you're doing great!!!! Carol- I did get your message...perked me right up. Thanks. I was napping when you called, so dh didn't wake me. As I stated above...the concert was great. We do have some pretty big names coming to Sacramento. I just got tickets for Michael Buble...I'm a sucker for a cutie singing Sinatra and other wonderful songs he's written himself. Can't wait for that one...May 4th...hopefully, I will not have started rads by then...I could use a little break between, but then that's up to the oncologists as having a break may not be OK. I'm so with you on how special our Jewel connection is...you described it well...like a teenager glued to their MySpace and IM's. I know I've said it before, but I feel so incredibly blessed to have you Jewels on my side. Bummer about the ticket, but nice he gave you a break. CathyCa- Thanks for setting the record straight about the boss...a lady of leisure sounds nice to me. What kinds of classes are you taking? I wish my chemo brain could wrap itself around a class, but that's not happening...although I did sign up for Ophrah's A New Earth class...great book. The message is so wonderful...much like or complimentary to things I've been reading all of my life. Hoping I can get back to my women's gym soon...I had just gotten started when I was diagnosed, so I feel as if I'll be starting all over again...which I will. My muscles have all but disappeared. CHJ- Sorry about the loss to your church of someone so beloved. I'm sure the family will understand why you couldn't stay and need comforting in a smaller setting in the near future. Therese- Loved the concert...and will be extra vigilant as I drive to my plastic surgeon's office in downtown Sac. Gotta run ladies. For those in the lounge today, kick cancer booty...for those in the fog and suffering se's tomorrow will be here soon...for those on the downward slide...take it easy, but have some fun while you're at it. Love to all, SIS Kimberly",

I\u2019m thinking after last nights bout with power surges, my image of wrapping up in a blanket to hibernate rather than my being enveloped by fog image is sounding a little too toasty warm for me.  Between Decadron and nuclear meltdowns, I slept fitfully to say the least until after 4:30 am when I was able to sleep for a full two and a half hours without waking, which is why I\u2019m running a little late.  My older sister is meeting me in 20 minutes or so for breakfast before we head out to the lounge.

Will go in next week to see my surgeon for a recheck, my oncologist to get my chemo start date, and my plastic surgeon to get drains removed and to add 100cc's to my expanders. My dx was Oct 10th and within less than two months, I was in surgery and on the road to recovery. It seemed like a long wait, but when reading some of the posts on this site...others have waited months. I can't even imagine the agony that must have been for those gals.

Thank you....without those who have gone before helping us through this...we'd be muddling along without direction. Just think, in a year from now, we will be doing the same for another group of women. To those who are having tests, treatments, or surgeries...I'm sending out postitive energy into the universe for you... To those, like me, waiting to begin chemo, enjoy the holidays....don't think about it or let it worry you as worry only takes away precious time that can be better used doing something way more fun...like drinking a good glass of red wine or a cranberritini with appetizers guaranteed to be 'bad' for you, and the love and laughter of friends and family. My sisters and friends are all convinced I haven't experienced much pain with my bilateral mastectomy with immediate expander placement-15 days ago- because I sent it out to the universe to have each of them take on what they could for me...all of them have been saying their breasts hurt for me. Now, those are good friends and loving sisters! :-) Just got back from the oncologist-start chemo after the 1st of the year- TAC (Taxodere, Adriamycin, and Cyclophosphamide). I'm all for the magic number three-Strike One, Strike Two, Strike Three...and you're out a there!!!!! Every three weeks is also working for me. I wrote a poem out of the blue yesterday. It wanted to be written, and who am I to deny it that? Cancer slinked in quietly dressed in black\u2026 unnoticed, acting all nonchalant so as not to draw attention to itself. Never suspecting its eventual discovery, it made itself at home. Caught like a thief in the spotlight of modern medicine, it was extricated from my breasts and sentenced to death. Reclaiming what has been stolen from me is impossible; nevertheless, I am content, for I have emerged the victor. I have survived to tell the tale. What more could one ask for during this holiday season? 100% Alive Today!!!!!! Merry Christmas Jewels, Your SIS(Sister In Survival) Kimberly P.S. Deb, now that I think of it, yes, I do work for the government. Technically teachers do work for the government since our pay comes from the state coffers, after each District has shaken out their budget, and I know how in love with acronyms they are...it's contagious.",

I agree the new grandchild is so much more important...who wants to be in the middle of treatment when you can be holding that new bundle of joy? June is my birth month, too. I'm an identical twin...born premature 46 1/2 years ago...I've always been rather a loner (since you mentioned being a loner)...needing lots of alone time...quiet time to rejuvinate. I can't handle big crowds and lots of noise...too much stimulus just drains my energy. I used to question if something was wrong with me...if I was antisocial...but I love people, just not lots of them all at once. I have often wondered if this has to do with being a premie in an age when the medical community didn't know much about the needs of premies or their development or lack of development. I wasn't allowed to be touched for the entire time- 2 months- I was in the hospital. Now, premies are held close and kept in stimuli controlled rooms...sounds nice. Must be why I like the spa environment so much. ;-) LJ13- I am so sorry to hear you aren't feeling well today. I heard the 3-6th day is when the SE's hit. I'm impressed that you did your 15 minutes on the treadmill...keeping up with your routine is important. Eating small meals and doing what you can to get your nutrients is all you can do, sweetie. Thanks for taking the time to share with us your experiences...we can do this together!!!! Carol- I can't believe how I too go straight to the computer every morning to check on all of you...and sometimes before bed as well. Maybe it's because I don't have mounds of papers to grade. I'm impressed you were out ALL DAY...keeping up with our OLE gal. Of course, I know you haven't started your chemo yet...but still...I haven't either, and I've not 'gone out' for an all day excursion yet...OK, I did one time, and it wiped me out! Kathy- Thank you so much for letting me know that Decadron won't cause weight gain. I've heard such horror stories about steroids. Whew!!!! I feel better now. Who will prescribe PT/OT for me? I'm all for that!!! I got my port during my mastectomy 12/6, but even the day after surgery, it didn't bother me as far as pain. You can get that creme to put on it before they use the port site to numb it...which of course as a PN you already know. It will be FINE, Kathy. At least you've got a start date...still waiting. I will call on Monday...maybe they were just doing half days last week due to the holiday. Suz from Dec '07-Thanks for stopping by and giving us moral support. It is so wonderful that you and others have stopped by to give us all encouragement. Well, off to do my other daily conversation threads to check in before showering and heading off to a matinee- We're seeing Charlie Wilson's War. I love stories based on real life and Tom Hanks. The rest of the cast is pretty impressive, too. Your SIS(Sister in Survival) Kimberly",

Yeah, the whole BRCA thing was just so ludicrous...all my doctors were just amazed at my insurances' denial. The reason my Dad got tested so easily is because he's a man with breast cancer...he didn't need to have a family history... and Medicare paid for it. So, thankfully those results will be here by the end of the month. I think driving a truck sounds way more interesting and entertaining than sitting at a desk as a secretary for some govt' agency. Do you ever get to go out on the tug boat? Vettegal-I'm so sorry you haven't gotten your path results yet. It is frustrating isn't it? It might be different if it weren't the holiday season....and all the people waiting for the same doc to get their results...he's probably on a much needed vacation. In the mean time, enjoy the New Year knowing we are all hoping for Negative Nodes. Kathy-To answer your question about why take everything. I too am premenopausal, but apparently, with ovaries out to knock out any potential creation of estrogen, the meds I'd take after chemo and rads would be for post menopausal women, and it has the slight potential of encouraging uterin cancer, so I thought why keep any of it if I no longer need it? Wow, a family of teachers. You went into a service position, too, and one like teachers that isn't often recognized as a 'real' profession. So, I will raise a glass to nurses and teachers tonight...BRAVO!!!! Arkansas Deb- I don't recall seeing you here before...I could be wrong...but welcome. We have a teacher at school who lost her hair to a weird autoimmune thing, too. Wouldn't that be a hoot if chemo had the opposite effect on you since you've already lost your hair...kind of like stimulants given to ADHD kids have the opposite affect-calms them down...but speeds others up. Speaking of which, D1 and LJ13, I'm sorry that you're just buzzing and fidgety...I heard the steroids can have that affect. Glad things are moving along, in more ways than one LJ13. God I hope the smell of coffee doesn't double me over...I love coffee. I wrote a poem earlier today and wanted to share my New Years Wish with you all. After much rain, the sun is shining on this final day of twenty-07, and I think of the many dear ones watching over us from heaven. Massive pearly gates and golden-winged angels isn\u2019t exactly what I imagine this place, but rather where souls give dissertations, accounting for their time in this Earthbound space. I imagine much hearty laughter as they recognize their many mistakes, and the futile agonizing they\u2019d done causing their hearts to physically ache. I try to listen for my loved ones messages, but sometimes the mundane gets in the way screaming over their persistent whispers, making it difficult to hear all they have to say. The message that always comes through though, no matter how loud the man-made clatter, is the truth that we are all of one human race, and acting with love is all that matters. It matters not what religion we hold dear, nor what political party we call our own, for we can all agree we bleed the same, and will reap what we each have sown. So as I go into this newest of years, that message kept near to my heart. I will aspire to treat all with love, knowing of this universe, we are all a part. HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!! LET US ALL ASPIRE TO MAKE 2008 MORE THAN GREAT!!!! SIS Kimberly",

D Walk today for sure. Kathy- WOW, thank you for your compliment regarding my poem. I do keep them on my laptop and on a thread I started on bc.org called Poetry Anyone? Good tip on the Ritalin if Rads should knock me over when I get to that point. I am so sorry to hear about your Dad...when it rains it pours doesn't it? The good news is...only 6 more days until you are on leave from work, you'll be able to be with him on the 9th, and he's only 2 1/2 hours away...not too far...at least you don't have to fly. I'll be thinking of you and your family on the 9th...sending out lots of positive energy into the universe. As D1 OLE stated, Biotene help eliminate dry mouth and keep your gums and mouth healthy. I prebought the toothpaste and mouthwash at Target. I now need to go get saline rinse for my nose. I so hate drugs/pills, but have heard Tylenol PM is a good idea for sleep when Decadron tries to keep you awake....anything else? D1 OLE-Thank you and sooooo cool!!!!! OH NO!!!! I won't like the taste of wine either? No coffee No wine...I hate bourbon and other brown liquor...am I too be without any vices????? Hysterical dental nightmare LOL I had a school dream last night...I was on my Prep period and ran an errand with my dh thinking I'd be back in plenty of time...but my dh has a tendancy to wonder and do too many little things in too short a span of time. I didn't have my phone...so I borrowed his...and everytime I dialed my school number some guy from Verizon said the number was not valid...I was paniced and crying hyterically, \" You have to help me get through. My class is going to start, and I won't be there in time...my kids will be left outside. I need to ask someone to let them in and get started. I'll be there in 15 minutes.\" He of course just kept telling me there was no such number. As I began to wake...my rational mind kicked in and said, \"Kim, you have a sub. You aren't working right now. Your kids are fine...they are safe.\" Man, that was intense!!!! They aren't even back in school from the Winter Break yet. I just love your posts...h*@# yes, the college girl needs to vaccume!!!! No convincing should even be needed. My 24 year old son wanted gift certificates to Target for Christmas so he could buy himself...you guessed it...a vacuume. Go figure! Carol-I did forget, and cool about the IPod. Isn't technology amazing and frustrating all at the same time? Good for you taking down all your Christmas stuff and taking the pups for a long walk. Today, i plan to take down what I can reach and put it on the dining room table...the Christmas storage box is in the garage...and I couldn't lift it even if i wanted to right now. My dh can get the box and the rest of the decorations down, and I'll put the stuff away in the storage box tomorrow. I also have the last of the Thank You cards to write. AZ Donna and Julie, good luck tomorrow 1/3/08...let us know how it goes. Julie, thanks for the info on your total hysterectomy...that doesn't sound so bad. I'll forward your message to my sis, so she can see that your sis doesn't regret her decision at all. Aren't insurance companies just ridiculous in their reasoning? \"Oh, please put me through hell by surgically removing my perfect for the moment natural breasts, so I can get perky new ones!!!\" Hello!!!! Who are they kidding? Did she do a total hysterctomy as well? With your family history, I'd imagine she did. NJ Cindy-Thanks for stopping by, and you are right...we are a positive energy group! Thanks for sharing the link...I just do a mass emailing, but others may find this very useful. OK, I think I'm caught up unless someone posted while I was writing this. Thinking of you all, Your SIS (Sister In Survival) Kimberly",

Ask for a mammogram, or if your breasts are really dense, request a Breast MRI. Ultrasound is great if you know exactly the spot to look, so that would be an option for you as well. A huge percentage of what is found is benign, so as Kathyjo stated, don't worry about it being cancer...the chances are huge that it is benign. My annual mammo this year in October ( been checked annually since my early 30's due to my father having had breast cancer-he's doing great- and had a clear mammo every year) only showed one tumor at 12 o'clock. It was deep, something I never would have felt. If I hadn't had the PET scan (at my urging due to changes in my left breast's appearance and how it felt, which my oncologist was happy to do-\"You know your breasts better than I do, and if this is not normal for you, let's check it out!\" ), the other two tumors (one at 7:30 and one axillary) would have never been found. The Breast MRI confirmed the two in the left breast, but it couldn't see the axillary due to the position of it, but a second ultrasound confirmed it since the doc knew exactly where to look. I am not trying to scare you with my story, only illustrate that you need to advocate for yourself...and as a nurse, I know you already know this...but as a woman who just found something strange in her breast at 29, you may need words of encouragment and a reminder that this is the only body you've got, \"Go do what you need to do for your body!\" We're here for you. Let us know how things go, please. Hoping for Benign!!!!! PS-I no longer have to worry about the uncomfortable big breast bra syndrome...I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders placed on 12/6/07, and I don't have to wear a bra. WhooHoo!!!! No headlights on in the cold for me. ;-) Good luck sweetheart, SIS(Sister In Survival) Kimberly",

      "Content": "Apr 28, 2008 02:06PM - edited Apr 28, 2008 02:14PM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, April 28, 2008 Morning has gently painted only two boards of the fence right next to the adolescent, ornamental strawberry tree outside my office window.  The sun's light is diffused as if it has not yet awakened.  The rest of the fence and my little tree are patient in the shadow listening to the symphony of songbirds while awaiting the gift they know will come.  I am that little adolescent this morning stuck between the shadow and the light wondering what is next. Indeed, what is next?  The shadow reminds me there are still cold nights ahead as recovering from the beating my body has taken will be slow, but the sunshine begs me to look towards morning as each day brings me closer to my new 100%. The question was raised in my online support group, \"How does one move forward from something like this without feeling paranoid about every ache, pain, or new sensation considering our bodies have betrayed us once already?\"  That is a good question. As humans, we do not like having our mortality thrust in our faces.  We want to believe that we are all going to live long and wonderful lives, so when something rises up and challenges you, \"You wanna bet?\", it tends to shake you right to the core.  Often that shaking up does not happen right away.  Being in survival mode tends to put one on a path with blinders on moving one step at a time and keeping to the plan that will get you to the buried treasure\u2026back to your life.  When the treasure is found, you are left to wonder, \"Now what do I do?\", because you know that you can never go back to the life that you were leading before.  The journey has changed you, and change is not always easy.  It takes readjustment, and that takes time and patience. I do not agree with, but do understand, the statement, \" our bodies have betrayed us\". My body did not betray me.  My body did what it knew how to do.  However, it did not know how to deal with years of being fed what we had been told until recently was 'good food' filled with hormones, antibiotics, pesticides, additives, preservatives, artificial colorings and flavorings, and high fructose corn syrup.  My body processed everything to the best of its ability, but eventually had no choice but to send out the S.O.S. to let me know I had to do something NOW!!!!!  Thank you body of mine for loving me enough to fight for me. Will I wonder if cancer is back with every new ache, pain, or unfamiliar sensation?  I don't know. Right now, I am in awe of my body and of its resilience.  I trust that if I give it what it needs, my body will do what it knows how to do. I know that nerves, which are trying to reach out and reconnect, will not be comfortable and could take many months to regenerate. I know that the numbness in my shoulder blades and running from my armpits down to my elbows will eventually go away, and that the feeling as it does will not be pleasant.  I know that the range of motion in both arms and shoulders will take time to return and that the tight and tender tendons and muscles, which have been traumatized, will once again be flexible. I know that as I build up my currently non-existent muscles that they will ache more than before, as it will take them longer to re-establish themselves.  I know that my stamina will not return overnight and that my body will tell me when it is time to rest.  I know that my bones will complain as they recreate themselves from the inside out after being repeatedly assaulted. I know that I will feel more at my chest wall than I have ever felt without the cushion of breast tissue once there, yet, that feeling will remind me to listen to my heart and the wisdom of my intuition. My body has been taken down to the barest of essentials.  Like a beautiful ancient forest, destroyed by a raging fire, what remains are the makings of a new and thriving ecosystem, and I, like the forest, will be present at every moment to witness the miracles. I don't know if I answered the questions previously posed to the satisfaction of those who have asked, but for me, I am grateful for the opportunity to think upon the questions and find in them my own answer. I will listen to my body. If my body says, \"This isn't right\", I will act. I know I have said this before, and I know that mere words are incapable of expressing the gratitude I feel for each one of you.  I have been truly blessed to witness humanity at its best.  The outpouring of love and support (and magic chicken soup) from friends, family, coworkers, and the friends and coworkers of my friends and my family, of neighbors and acquaintances, and even of total strangers has been a lesson in the power of community. Speaking of the power of community, my online support, my Jewels and my Angel Watchers, have provided me with an unconditional let it all hang out forum. Without them, getting through this without a total melt down would not have been possible. To find these two groups, out of all the support groups available to me, was not an accident, of that I am sure. The fog has lifted. Thank you for standing vigil with your lanterns, flash lights, and fog horns, and for the loving encouragement to follow your voices. For those of you who did the Boogie-Man shuffle-right-on-out-of-town dance\u2026THANK YOU!!!!  The infection seems to have retreated. I have one more antibiotic infusion today, and tomorrow I see the plastic surgeon. I hope that all looks well from his point of view. The mounds are getting softer...yippee!!! Let the healing begin!!!!! xoxoxo Kimberly PS- OK, so yesterday, I thought, I've got some energy, I think I'll sweep and mop the floor , which hadn't been done in months. Darn good thing we have the color floor tile we do. It hides a multitude of things. Even my broom and mop were saying, \"Ewww...that is so gross!\". Ummm, how did I ever clean the entire house in one morning?  I personally vote for the following new motto, \" Your house doesn't have to be perfect. Do one chore, or not, and call it good for a day.\"   I personally invite anyone to borrow that motto.  Still feeling  low on the energy front (it took me several hours to compose), but should be up to full on shout outs soon. Dana- I knew my Little Warrior would shake herself off and march onward. I'm so proud of your positive attitude!  Maz, I've been thinking of you. Glad Val was there to bring everyone back together. ValAngel will certainly be with you on Wednesday...last one!!! WhooHoo!!!!  Kathy- I'm sorry you had a crummy morning, and so glad your dh understands. LOL on your description of yourself. wvgirl- I just reread my post to you about the DH. Man, I can just be blunt, can't I?  I'll have to work on that.  Hope your peaceful weekend gave you time to reflect and enjoy your daughters' company.  You have so grown since we first met here.  You are coming into your powerful self, girl!!!!  Paula- Loved the pics. Congrats on being done with chemo.   Julie- I'm with ya on the too pooped to pop energy level.  Glad you're coming out of the fog. OK, my eyes are heavy, and I've got to post this before I fall asleep at the computer and lose it all.  To those heading off to the tanning booth today, don't forget your sunglasses. ",

I did meet a friend at Starbucks, nothing I got had any taste-sigh, but it was good to see her. Then, I went to the grocery store. It is amazing that just showering, getting dressed, and then doing a couple of errands can wipe you out. Whoohoo, LJ13. Only one more to go!!!!  Sorry about the whole swelling issue, but like you said, only one more to get through, and then your poor body can start healing itself from all of the toxins. Loved your apple smashing story. D1- Oh, poor Frankenboob. Blisters on the nipple under your compression garment - ouch!!!  I don't know that I'd even want my dh let alone myself to rub anything on it if I were you. Sounds painful. I got your cards in the mail today, so I\u2019ll get the Secret Pals out in the mail tomorrow to those participating in this round of Secret Pals.  Anyone who hasn\u2019t joined in and wants to, can send their info and be included in the next round in Sept. Maz- Isn\u2019t it great to be able to say, the last fog? WhooHoo!!! I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having such a hard time with missing Val. Grief certainly does have its own time schedule, and it\u2019s usually long winded and drawn out as time puts space between the rawness of the feelings you\u2019re having now and those loving memories that await to comfort you when you\u2019re ready. It\u2019s only been a week since the funeral. It is so normal that you\u2019re still crying. Be patient with yourself. And feeling lost after your last chemo...normal, too. ((((HUGS)))) Patty- Wow, you\u2019ve got a lot going on right now. No wonder you had a melt down. One can only take so much before it has to release.  Too bad you weren't in the apple aisle. You wouldn't have had to clean up the mess. Pay for the apples maybe, but no clean up.  \"Bald lady having a melt down on aisle 12.  Clean up crew to aisle 12\"  I\u2019m so glad you have such a good support system, a sense of humor when it counts, and that you\u2019ve been able to be with your vettasis for some bonding time. Take care of your neck. Maybe your dh could rub lotion on your neck, too, and give it a little massage to help loosen things up. No worries about not being on the boards. You just take care of you and your sis. Let her know we are all thinking of her and sending out all our positive vibes for a quick and easy recovery. SheShe- Chills, red face, and pink boob, eh? There's a song in there somewhere. Did the rads onc tell you that could be a side effect?  Weird. Hope that doesn\u2019t last the entire time you have to do rads. See ya all in the morning.

Hmmmm Peg- I'm glad you checked in.  Let's say it again...WhooHoo...the last one!!!!   About your son being in his manic phase.  Man, that's got to be tough because there is nothing you can do or say when a bipolar patient is feeling so 'high' to get them to see realilty.  You are right to let your worry go as much as you can as it makes no sense to worry about something you can't change.   I assume his son is with his mother?  Are you close enough to see him?  Must be tough on he and his mother to have to deal with such roller coaster behavior, of course at 3 maybe he isn't really aware yet.  Must have been really tough to raise your boy never knowing what the mood would be.  I assume your son isn't taking his meds since he's in a manic phase.  I'm sorry you are having to deal with that on top of bc, but like you said. You are one strong lady, and there's a lot of support out their for families of bipolar patients.  I hope you've reached out for that support. As you've learned here, there's nothing like talking to those who really know what it's like to live through having a bipolar family member.

Oh, and the Spring Sing I mentioned was part of my shout out to Julie. No there is only one Spring Sing, and it's happening in Julie's neck of the woods. Therese- I'm so glad you're doing well other than feeling so tired...so then tell me why you're driving?   I know you've already had two naps today, so hopefully you will stay awake during the play tonight.   So, the girls are looking good, eh?  I can't wait!  Hmmm, I haven't been told I need a sports bra or anything yet, but there's plenty of time for him to notify me of all the things that need to be done prior. I probably won't check in until Sunday as I've got my walk tomorrow and plans tomorrow night.  Have a great weekend, gals. SIS Kimberly ",

      "Content": "May 14, 2008 08:25PM - edited May 14, 2008 08:29PM by SISKimberly Good afternoon/early evening Jewels, Well, I\u2019m back from my day out. Took the ds to get his books for summer session and had lunch, got my picture frames for my vision board, and got some new capris at Kohls, buy one get one free, can\u2019t beat that! Oh, yeah, and I saw the radiological oncologist. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to heading into that environment after feeling so darn free, but she was very nice and explained all the reasons why I should consider rads. Being high risk, I have a 30% chance of recurrence and rads may decrease that chance to maybe 10% -these are relative numbers. This I knew from my research. My dh was with me, and after our meeting was all said and done, he and I were still not convinced this was the way to go. There were two things the onc. was basing her decision on: lymph involvement and the margins of one of my tumors. She told us that the lymph involvement was 40% and anything over 20% is recommended for rads.  My dh stated later to me, \u201cso if your surgeon had taken more than 10 lymph nodes, that 4 of 10, or 40%, would have dropped, so how is that even a legitimate measure of deciding treatment?\u201d  Good point. She also told me that the margins of the tumor at 7:30 were not clear at the chest wall. My surgeon didn\u2019t say a word about not having clear margins when she went over my pathology report. I just looked at my path report again and the front of the report states the tumor of concern for the onc. is 0.3cm from the margin. According to my research, surgeons prefer at least 1 millimeter, or 0.1cm, from affected areas to the margin. 0.3cm is more than 0.1cm, right? So, again, I have to say, the dh and I are not convinced this is a reason to do rads. I\u2019ll be calling my surgeon tomorrow to just check in with her about her interpretation of my path as I know she would have stated her concern if there weren\u2019t clear margins. OK, moving on\u2026 Carol- Thanks for calling to check in with me about my appt. and for supporting me in my decision.  I know you and the other Jewels care about me, and that is worth so much in my book. LJ13- Sounds like the softball game was a great game. I totally understand the nostalgia thing. Being a dancer, I see wonderful dancing shows on stage or like DWTS and So You Think You Can Dance, and it just takes me back to when dancing was a big part of my life. Sigh\u2026.great times, great memories, and so glad I had the chance to experience that. Did you call the doc? D1- Wow, you had a busy day. No wonder you\u2019re pooped.  Pour yourself a little glass of wine and watch something tivo\u2019d.  I wonder which wine goes well with TV? Maybe you could look that up in your new book. Go for the aroma therapy during the facial! Kathy- Glad you had a good \u2018off\u2019 day. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ll be able to keep your NP license clear with the hours at the old office, and agree wholeheartedly about watching that you don\u2019t over extend yourself. OK Deb, go get \u2018em tomorrow. WhooHoo on it being the last one!!!! SIS Kimberly Hey, CathyCa, we must have been composing at the same time. Glad the appt. times work with your schedule and that your tats aren't too noticeable, and certainly hope that the techs are way better organized than the front office. ",

Of course, the car(s) can't be driven even when dd is visiting from her freshman year, which means car sharing during visits.

I'll give you the highlights of my trip when I get back, OK. I've got 45 minutes to be there, and I haven't even showered. Told you I've been at this all day. SIS Kimberly Love the new avatar Carol!!!!!  Yeah on good counts and congrats on the one year anniversary!!!!  Give your hubby a big ole IOU for when you're more up for being intimate...I know he would rather you be totally into it than feeling like it was obligatory because it was your anniversary.",

Have a wonderful Sunshiney Day...and if you don't have sunshine where you are, just put on the song Walking On Sunshine and dance about...a great mood lifter!!!!

I cleaned up my room \u2013 getting things off the wall, shelves emptied, back room organinzed and clean, and whipping down counters and stuff. My sub, although a sweet guy wasn\u2019t too keen on keeping a clean room. The new night janitor told me he really tried, but it was always such a mess on a daily basis. He\u2019s heard what a neat freak I am at school and looks forward to cleaning my room next year. All I can say, is it felt so good to get all of that done. I just couldn\u2019t bare walking into that mess before school started. Granted the kids packed the boxes based on what was in an area, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a mish mash, but that\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019ve got two retirees coming in to help me set things up for next year the week before school starts. I'm so lucky. So, today is the big day\u2026NO, my foobies aren\u2019t going to be big, just the fact I\u2019m getting \u2018em sillies...or was that just going through my mind?   haHaha Couldn\u2019t sleep after about 4am. This patch I have to wear the night before surgery just parches me. I drank tons of water the last two days, and I feel like my mouth is a desert and my skin is as dry as the Sahara, too. Blah!!!! I\u2019m hungry and thirsty\u2026WHAHHHH!!!! OK, I\u2019m done whining. I\u2019ll just read and catch up on posts to take my mind off of things. D1- So, your painters should be done today. Of course, after feeding them homemade banana nut muffins, they might linger a little longer hoping for more. I know getting stuff clean and put away is such a boost to the ole mood. I like stuff to be in its place, too. Drives me nuts to have piles and things looking chaotic for too long. How\u2019s that rotator cuff after the legu yesty? Joan- I\u2019m glad you liked the Dog story. And thanks for your best wishes for today\u2019s surgery. CathyCa- I am so jealouse of you and D1 traveling to that part of the country. My dh and I really want to see Croatia and Slovakia and Slovinia as well as the other countries mentioned. I\u2019ve only been to Italy and had a meal in Switzerland. Can\u2019t wait to hear all about both of your journeys. Thanks for the info on the Copper Canyon. I\u2019ll put that on my list of places to see. Jenn- It is so good to see you posting at length, and yeah for the lightening and stuff skirting by you this time around. LOL on no rest for the wicked and you not being that bad. What is in the stuff you already got? It may be magnesium and Vit. D. I loved Helen Reddy growing up. Carol- It pains me to hear you\u2019re tummy is still acting up,and more than usual. FUSE!!!! Hope the Raisin Bran got things moving for you. Yeah, I\u2019m afraid I will be dehydrated by the time we get this show on the road. I drank lots of water the past two days, but with my parched mouth and skin this morning, you\u2019ld never know it. Glad the dh\u2019s promotion will be a good move for him and provide a little extra mula for the step daughter\u2019s private university.  Wow, dating for 10 years. That certainly does take commitment\u2026you had a common law marriage at the very least before Kent whished you away to Vegas to make an honest woman of ya.  Congrats. I love your friends Bye Bye Hair party with the nude colored bathing caps. LOL Kathy- Bravo on the pampering yourself time!!!! My sides are really short, but laying down already. My top side is still sticking straight up and looking a little darker on top than the sides. Hmmmm, a reverse skunk look? Excellent on particapting \u2013 or thinking about it- another race for the cure just as you\u2019re heading into on tomorrow. Have a great time, and congrats on being the big mula raiser!!! WhooHoo!!!! I have the same comments about our house. The gal that came to do the estimate said, \u201cWow, your house is pretty darn clean for someone who claims to not have been able to keep up.\u201d I haven\u2019t dusted and vacuumed in at least a month, I am sad to report. Julie- You\u2019ve been a busy bee. Glad you\u2019ve got the get up and go on track again. What a great pic of you, and of you and your sis. You\u2019re hair is definitely coming in dark. Glad the ds had a good time at bball. Can\u2019t hurt to have another sport to enjoy. Well, it\u2019s 7:30am, and I\u2019ve got about 2 and ½ hours before my twinsis arrives. We- twin sis, dh, and I, will leave for the hospital around 10:30. I\u2019ll post when I can. Hopefully, tomorrow. SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Jun 15, 2008 03:47PM SISKimberly wrote: So, we arrived in Sonora around 5:00 only 2 hours after we left Folsom. Sonora is an old mining town that still has its old cowboy charm. We ate at Outlaws BBQ and Steakhouse\u2026a coffee shop setting with some pretty darn good ribs.  The concert was in Murphy\u2019s about 16 miles from Sonora. It was great. Los Lonely Boys opened for Sheryl Crow, and then she played for almost two hours straight. She is a beautiful woman with a talented group backing her up.  The venue was a winery - not such great wine IMO- with a 6,000 person capacity outdoor amphitheater.  Besides the food and drink tents, there was a group of young people giving Free Hugs...how fun was that getting 'gentle' hugs... since I just had surgery and can't be squeezed too tightly yet...from a line of fabulous young people?  We saw the same guy with a different recruit at the Farmer's Market, where I got some awesome Nectarines) in Senora where we stayed the next day and got more hugs!!!!  I also had several people just walk up to me over the two days we were gone and tell me how beautiful I was\u2026just made me all warm inside. Who can complain with hugs and comliments being spread around? Life is sooo good. We spent time in Murphy\u2019s yesty morning after breakfast in Sonora across for our historic hotel- The Sonora Inn. There wasn\u2019t a plumb wall in site. Our room literally had a slant in the floor with the windows being the uphill side. The colors were that slate blue and dusty rose color of the 80\u2019s country crafty phase and white trim. The carpet was thin and dark blue, and the bath was two steps up from the room. I thankfully didn\u2019t kill myself in the middle of the night trying to get to the potty.  It seems we are destined to stay in rooms with character this summer. In Murphy\u2019s I bought some Lavender Linen spray- love to spray it on my pillow before sleep- , some homemade olive oil we got to put into a bottle from the cask, an aroma therapy candle (D1 got me thinking that was a great idea), and a new Euro purse and wallet. I\u2019ve had a hard time carrying my purse with my gimpy arms, so the Euro purse is thin and slips over the head and lays flat on your hip so it can\u2019t easily be snatched.  Much more comfortable. Afterwards, we headed to Fairplay to pick up our wine shipments. I hadn\u2019t been in a long time.  We stopped in Sutter Creek on the way for lunch and to check on a lot we own. There was a fire in the canyon just below our lot.  It looked like the fire dept had a handle on things and that our lot and the houses surrounding were not in any danger. The scenery along our drive was just beautiful. We made it to the winery just as they closed, but seeing it was us, the owners had no problems hanging with us to pick up wine and taste a little. We got home, after dropping off my twinsis and her beau, around 8pm. We hit 8 counties in one day!  So, what\u2019s been up with you all since I left?  Hmmmm\u2026 Norma- Hi, you\u2019ve been busy with those boys.  What kind of a car did you buy?  Sheryl Crow has  new song about Gasoline. She had five huge semi-trucks to haul her equipment, so I imagine after getting the bill for putting gas into those is what inspired that song. D1- No bedbugs as there haven\u2019t been bites since that one incident. I\u2019m thinking it was just a rogue bug that found its way inside. How sweet your dd\u2019s want to cook for their dad. How did the cake turn out? What a great name\u2026a schnoodle\u2026sounds like an Austrian dessert. I love that song, Bennie and the Jets.  I remember as a kid not hearing the lyrics accurately, and my twinsis and I singing loudly at the top of our lungs\u2026\u2019she\u2019s got electric boobs\u2019  Hysterical. We never understood what that meant, but sang it anyway. Isn\u2019t it weird what just brings us smiles and joy at being alive these days?  Sap?  Heck no!!!!  You have every right to celebrate with tears or no tears!!!! And loud music from our youth is always a bonus!!! Interesting dreams. Since dreams are often symbolic or metaphors, maybe it\u2019s your subconscious mind letting that go? Kathy- What a huge bonus to have dd\u2019s dance recital, the grandparents\u2019 visit, and Father\u2019s Day all in one fail swoop. Did the kids make their dad anything this year?  I love the homemade stuff kids make. Bummer you aren\u2019t happy with the tat.  Can you research who specializes in breast tats in your area and go there?  I\u2019ve heard on this site that people have gotten great 3-D tats done. Joan- OMG, I can\u2019t believe you and Paula are done next week. It seems like you both just started. Congrats on being almost done, and without major se\u2019s or blistering either. Nice!!!! So, schools out now, right? LWDana- Thanks for the news.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing so well in school and feeling so good about life right now.  I agree that cancer has been an unexpected gift and that you never whom you\u2019ll learn something from.  Also glad to hear the ex is being kinder, and way to go on getting hit on by lots of men. You go, girl. Excellent that you\u2019re going on a cruise. Where will you go? Being in San Diego, will it be a Mexican Riviera cruise?  Hope your grant will pay for that and allow you to move out! Keep us posted on how your scans and all go, OK?  Seems your med team is exactly the one you were meant to find.  Makes all that waiting and worrying about insurance etc, worth it,doesn\u2019t it? Julie- I can\u2019t even imagine doubling up, but so understand wanting to just get that skin stretched and get on with the exchange. So, you\u2019ll have about 6 weeks from the last fill to allow the skin to relax. Perfect.  You\u2019ll be ready for August 12th (my ds 25th bday), but there will be no lifting at that point, and you may find your range of motion challenged. OK, I\u2019m not much for banana anything or rum anything, but I love to read. Just finished a book called Family Ties and started another called Something Borrowed. Not really thinking type books, more easy relaxing reads, but there are discussion points for certain in each. Can I join D1 and Tina and BYOB? Tina- How exciting to be celebrating your ds\u2019s graduation next week. You sound like you\u2019ve got plenty of energy tackling staining the deck and doing a deep cleaning inside the house. Yeah for dh\u2019s help in that dept.  The menu sounds perfect for a big group of grads and the proud adult crowd. LJ13- WhooHoo on the drain removal for you, too.  Are you happy with the results?   I was sooo lucky this time around.  After the initial expanders, I was draining like you\u2019re talking about right now, but after the exchange, it was only two days before my output was less than 10 on each side. After 6 days, those puppies got yanked. I\u2019m 10 days out today, and feeling better each day. You sound totally ready to go for your tanning adventure. Carol \u2013 Congrats and taking your LAST pill today!!!!! Your weekend sounds like it was a blast! Ginny\u2019s house sounds gorgeous. Enjoy your dinner with all the Dad\u2019s today. And happy belated birthday to Deb.  Hope you spent the entire weekend, and I\u2019m partial to the birthday week, or month if you can get away with it, having it be all about you! My dad lives in San Francisco, so I\u2019ll be calling him to say Happy Father\u2019s Day. SIS Kimberly",

I was also rolling on the floor with your description of dd screaming over worms and your evil delight in her squeals. LOL Carla- Me too on the chemo gas except mine wasn\u2019t loud and letting go whenever it felt the need\u2026thankfully. I was able to keep it under control with GasX.  Glad that part of the journey is over for all of us\u2026except Kris, who is soooo close to being done.  We\u2019re standing at the finish line waiting for you Kris and cheering you on,so no worries that you\u2019ll be left behind. Jenn- Wow, your flower beds were weeded, and you won the auction basket you\u2019ve been eyeing, and there\u2019s a massage gift certificate in the basket along with all kinds of others goodies\u2026WhooHoo!!!!  Life is good, isn\u2019t it? Carol \u2013 Love the collage idea!!!!  See, you\u2019re always thinking of ways to brighten a Jewels day. OK, now I can move on to the posts after my last post. Silly me. D1- I\u2019m keep telling Carol what a giver she is\u2026 Actually, my doc isn\u2019t my gyn,but my primary care provider. He\u2019s in his 60\u2019s and took over his father\u2019s practice when his father retired. The nurse at my rad consult was a patient of my doc\u2019s father she said.  He\u2019s a real small town doc who does stitches and injections\u2026heard him ask his nurse to bring him several cc\u2019s of Decadron yesty\u2026yuck\u2026I felt for the poor person getting that shot. Anyway, he\u2019s a great doc. Glad you and the dh could share a laugh about the nurse this morning. All the pics I\u2019ve seen of you are GORGEOUS!!!! Heck, ya your man\u2019s got it good.  So this Thermage just stimulates collagen which will fill in the scars, or plump them out? Oh, I had a friend who did a chemical peel. Ouch is right, but her skin definitely looked smoother and younger. Hey, it\u2019s sunshiney and beautiful here this morning, too. Man\u2026who knew I had such power as to sway the sun god? Cathy \u2013 Man, you have been a busy girl. Sorry to hear you\u2019re older son is having issues. Hope those resolve soon. Congrats on the younger son\u2019s graduation. Isn\u2019t it crazy to think he\u2019s already old enough to be moving out into the world? Way to go on your breast doing so well with rads. I\u2019m thinking your salt water pool is doing the trick along with regular lubes. What scans have you had since starting rads other than the ones they needed to make sure they had your positioning right?  My onc hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t be scheduling a scan anytime soon according to our last conversation. Norma \u2013 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re asking your gyn to do the hormone check. Onc\u2019s don\u2019t seem to want to deal with anything that doesn\u2019t directly effect their focus. Your hip and leg pain is definitely from chemo. That\u2019s a side effect. Chemo can also deplete bone mass. Tamox can cause muscle and joint pain as well, so be aware of that potential se.  I just read an article regarding the se\u2019s of Tamox not being fully disclosed in the same way by all parties involved, so if you\u2019ve not had a particular symptom prior to bc, and all of a sudden it shows up, I\u2019m thinkin\u2019 it\u2019s related to Tamox. The fact that several gals here are taking it will give you all a way to keep track of se\u2019s like we did with our chemo drugs. Insurance will have no choice but to pay for an ooph if you develop ovarian cysts as many women seem to do on Tamox. My girlfriend was only on it for two months and developed cysts. Her gyn told her they can remove her ovaries if they don\u2019t resolve. She also developed a vertigo issue after taking Tamox. Her onc told her that neither the cysts nor the vertigo were Tamox related. Oh, Pleeezzzz. So, I\u2019m off to meet a gal for lunch and then off to school. When I get home, it\u2019ll will be ironing and packing for Chicago.  OHHHHH, I just scored two tickets to Wicked!!!! I'll be thinking of you, D1, in response to your dd's worm reaction when I hear the evil witch's laughter. hahaha Man, we are going to be in entertainment heaven!!!! TTFN, SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Jun 27, 2008 07:54PM - edited Jun 27, 2008 08:00PM by SISKimberly OK, that seems to have worked although I appear to be a bit stretched like those funhouse mirrors.  I got home late last night...delays in Phoenix. It was close to 1AM Chicago time (11pm my time), so I was beat!!!!  Went to my PT appt at 9am this morning and D1, may I just say, I've got myself a babydoc!  What a cutie patootie.  I will be seeing him three times a week to do myofacial release (painful), heating pads, electrical stem, and ultrasound, and of course stretching exercises.  I can so do the pain if I get to look at babydoc...well, there have to be perks, right gals?  Anyway, major issues with my chest muscles, shoulders, and arms. Rotator cuff issues on the right...overcompensating se since my left is the problem, I carry everything with the right. So, the good news is that even though it will take some time, it will be resolved!!!!  Then went downstairs to get the results of my PAP and FSH test. PAP is in the normal range and my FSH is 55 which according to the scale puts me on the lower end of Post Menopause.  I plan to ask for the test again in three months to see if my number goes up...the higher the better.  If it goes up, then I'll be more secure in the fact that my ovaries are shutting down and not thinking about starting up again. The cleaning gal came by to clean the house while I was at PT before the big shin dig tomorrow celebrating my twinsis' and my 47th bday, Greg's and my 6th anniversary, and me being done with bc treatment. I had a fabulous time in Chicago. I want to tell you all about it, but this weekend will be pretty booked with company, so I won't be on the puter much. I promise to fill you in starting on Monday. Thought I might give a little bit of the trip with pics each day for several days like a travel log to keep you all riveted to your computers waiting for the next installment. HahaHa...no, really, it's more like giving me a chance to get my thoughts together. I've read all the posts, but can't possibly do shoutouts for the past six days, so suffice it to say that I'm glad you were all taking care of eachother in my absence. Lots going on...eggs forgotten, puppies gotten, scans have been had while one scan scheduler was bad. Open houses were fun and several Jewels were on the run (OK, it was a 5k walk, but I needed a rhyme).  MIA Jewels reported back and one Jewel scored in the sack.  One DH wasn't very nice while another gave his gal pink roses, a beautiful gift, a fabulous dinner, and champagne on ice.  I know I've missed stuff with pink boobs and pealing on the nips and under the arm, and booster spots still warm after rads and slathering butter and aloe being the charm.  Reading all about the this and that, and the thus and such, man, you miss a lot when you're out of touch. SP...I love the beautiful Zuluwood beaded strands that I can wear as a necklace or if doubled up several times as a bracelet.  I also loved the Quirky Cork for my wine bottle that says Wine Tastes Better With Friends!!!!  Why yes it does. Speaking of wine and friends, our cafe patio...the HOA has sent us a letter saying we have to rip it out and replace the fence.  Hell NO!!!!!  I've got the HOA rules about fencing and we have not broken any of the rules. Besides the neighbors all love it. So, I'm going to write them a letter citing their own rules and attaching a list of our neighbors signatures stating that they are all thrilled with our new fence and ask them to grant us a variance, which is also in the 'rules'. I think they're just upset because we didn't jump through all the hoops in the right order. If after my really nice letter and signatures the HOA doesn't agree, then I'll be contacting an attorney since I don't believe any HOA has the legal power to fine us and demand we take down our fence. I really dislike the power pissing contest thing, but if they end up wanting to play it that way, then game on for they do not know who they have called out onto the carpet....SuperGirl! Gotta go. Haven't seen my honey in six days and last night, I was so late it was like I didn't even see him. We're going out to dinner just the two of us since the whole weekend will be filled with company.   Love to all, SIS Kimberly  PS Therese, nope I am not your SP, just saw that card and thought of you. ",

I typed this earlier, so thought I'd do a quick insert, then go back and catch up in the morning before I head out to my port flush and lunch with a friend. I had my follow-up with my surgeon, whom I adore, and was presented with a gift of hair gel made for post chemo hair when it gets to the length it may need a little taming\u2026maybe in a few weeks. It doesn\u2019t dry the hair or flake.  I got hugs from Dr. Guirguis and her assistant after they read my gift to them\u2026a pic of me in my Supergirl cape with my poem Ode to my Body and my reflections on being done with treatment. They both just loved it.  So, I\u2019ll see her in February, and she wrote me a lab slip to redo my FHS and then to also do my Estradiol levels. She said they both need to be showing I\u2019m in menopause before we can be sure of my status.  She supported my decision not to do rads and Tamox, but said I may want to consider taking an AI after we get the results in Feb. I told her I would consider it, but would be doing a lot of research first, which she understood. Then it was off to my plastic surgeon\u2019s office.  I gave him a pic as well with a copy of my poem. He and the gals in the office really loved it.  He was also very pleased with my foobies although he thinks the left is still a bit smaller than the right even though he added more fluid to it originally.  I told him it wasn\u2019t that noticeable to me and besides, natural breasts aren\u2019t always identical anyway.  He smiled.  I see him in August for my final post op appt. Afterwards, I walked to the hospital to see a friend of mine\u2019s mom who has been there since last Monday for surgery of cancer of the appendix (is that how you spell the body part?) which hasn\u2019t appeared to spread anywhere else. However, because the cancer was touching the ovary, fallopian tube, and the top section of her large intestines they removed those just to be sure it hadn\u2019t spread to them. It hadn\u2019t. Just finished a late lunch with the twinsis, drove home, and have about 30 or so minutes before I need to leave for yoga. Travel log\u2026segment #2.  June 22,2008 We woke early, got ready, and met Kathleen\u2019s coworkers from the Tempe, Arizona office in the lobby. Made a bee line for the Star Bucks then hopped on the M bus to take us to the McCormick Center, a large convention center that once housed warehouses of the garment district.  The organizers of the SHRM(Society of Human Resources Management) conference did an outstanding job with tranportation, having lots of volunteers to point people in the right direction, a place for people to store luggage if needed, a spot to make reservations for lunch and time off for those attendees who came alone and wanted to network, a fabulous bookstore, and HUGE exhibition hall.  There were over 13,000 people in attendance from all over the world. After registering, I went to the bookstore with the gals to look around. I asked the gentleman at the door if Mr. Portier would be signing books, but he said, \u201cRegrettably, no.\u201d  I was disappointed as I told him that Mr. Portier and Lionel Richie were the only reason I\u2019d come as a guest.  I did decide to purchase Mr. Portier\u2019s book anyway even though Kath was looking out for me and told me I could get it at home and not have to carry it around.  I found two other books I felt would be good for my classroom and went to the cashier to check out.  Naomi, my cashier, was so bubbly and friendly.  She asked where I was from and how I liked Chicago so far, and as I signed my receipt told me to enjoy the rest of my conference.  I explained I was only a guest and had paid the $350 guest pass so I could hear Sydney Portier speak since that was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and that going to the Lionel Ritchie concert was just a bonus in my book.  She looked at me and said, \u201cI have a surprise for you.\u201d I must have looked surprised as she pulled out from beneath her register a label with Sydney\u2019s actual autographed signature telling me he\u2019d only signed a few and that she was told only to hand them out to people she felt would really appreciate it.  I about fell over.  I was so excited I was jumping up and down saying, \u201cReally?\u201d  and \u201cOh, my God!\u201d while Kath kept saying, \u201c Kimberly, be careful with the jumping up and down, new foobies on board.\u201d  Naomi was just tickled with my reaction and kept telling her coworkers, \u201cYou should have seen her reaction. Wish I\u2019d had a camera.\u201d  I carefully placed the signature into my book and thanked Naomi over and over again for choosing me.  Needless to say, every time I was at the bookstore, we hugged.  I am so blessed. I was walking on cloud 9.  Took my picture next to Sydney before heading back to our Bus Route M stop. We had time before the Opening General Session, so we went back to the hotel, dropped off our purchases, and ate brunch. Afterwards, I attended the first session with Kath for the first hour until 1:00 or so before I got up to get in line to hold seats for the girls up as close as possible to Mr. Portier.  The Guest speaker at the session was a man named Steve Gilliland. He talked about Leading from the Heart.  He had a great sense of humor and a fabulous ability to tell a good story. Anyway, I guess others had the same idea to line up early, but I still managed to get fairly close up. I held our seats for almost an hour and then Mr. Portier was introduced after SHRM business was taken care of\u2026the current CEO was leaving after 20 years and this was the 60th Annual conference in the city in which SHRM was created. May I just say\u2026still at 81\u2026Mr. Portier is one handsome man! He spoke so eloquently and with some humor about his life and finished with the thought that, \u201cIt isn\u2019t that we get up when we are knocked down that matters as much as what we do once we\u2019re up.\u201d  Isn\u2019t that the truth. Afterwards, Kath and I got cleaned up and took a cap to Spiaggia, an Italian restaurant I wanted to go to after meeting the chef and buying her cook book at the Monterey Wine Festival two years ago. It was the most expensive meal I\u2019ve paid for myself, but I soooo deserved it. An 8 course small plate meal with a wine pairing for each course. Thankfully only a two ounce pour until we got to the Nebiollo, my favorite, so I was given a 4 ounce pour of that. Anyway, Kath was just so thrilled to have been taken to this restaurant as she doesn\u2019t normally eat in such high class shi-shi places. It was a meal that capped off the perfect day!  I'll catch up in the morning.  Oh, my SP sent me a great birthday gift...an awesome mug with an inspiration saying on the back, birthday tea (who knew there was something called Birthday Tea by the BagLadies? - that has carmel flavor, an Origami Peace Crane, and a card. Thanks SP.  SIS Kimberly ",

      "Content": "Jul 21, 2008 03:00PM - edited Jul 21, 2008 03:37PM by SISKimberly Good Afternoon Jewels, Had PT this morning at 8:30 then ran some errands. Been on the phone with our mortgage company since. Seems our taxes went up over $1500 so our escrow was short and our payment went up $304.82 a month. Found out when the loan was processed it was set at the land only price, not the actual price. Crap, that wasn\u2019t too smart on their part. Oh well, just have to suck that up. Anywhooo, so what\u2019s up with the Jewels. Carol \u2013 Man, I am soooo impressed with how much you\u2019re  walking. I imagine that it is easier when you go out with a group and talk the whole way.  I could do more than 2 miles at a time I\u2019m sure, but not so sure about 18 in one stretch. I\u2019ve never walked the full trail, so that will be a good thing for us to do. I am so looking forward to your visit. Glad you didn\u2019t have the hot spot issue on your walk this time. Hooray for Epsom salts. I love Whidbey Island\u2026well, that whole area actually. Doing a practice run will be fun, and you\u2019ll do fine in your four person tent. Think of it as a big old slumber party outdoors like when you were a kid. I remember having camp outs in out friends back yard, and we created a monster that we\u2019d have to slay during the night. We made our weapons, too. After watching Creature Features, we\u2019d head out to the backyard to \u2018sleep\u2019, and the plan was to wake up and slay the monster during the night. We never did wake up to slay the monster, but it was fun anticipating that we might. Yeah that your dh was able to come home and enjoy a flank steak with you, your fil, and a friend. We had a salmon salad last night. It was warm yesty and the dh wanted to eat light.  Grilled the fish and then placed it over baby greens with cucumber. Yummers.  Had a Pinot with it.  Finished the meal off with some fresh berries for dessert. Paula- I am relieved to hear Ed is doing bette with his stomach and seizures. You so deserved to get out of the house and unwind with dinner, a movie, and a little shopping after being cooped up inside. I so want to see Mama Mia. I\u2019ve heard friends and my sisters all say they just loved the musical stage version. Cathy \u2013 I hope your son as a bit more maturity under his belt as well. Having to redo classes is a big lesson in itself. Fingers crossed. Your youngest should be back from the oral surgeon by now. I hope he isn\u2019t too uncomfortable. Getting wisdom teeth out isn\u2019t a big ole jump in a cool pond on a hot day that\u2019s for sure. D1- Seems we were both dealing with unexpected money expenditures. WTF on the cost of those garments?  I hope that at least they are better than what you had\u2026more comfortable. Damn that Tamox!  I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like being on the edge like that, but then I wouldn\u2019t have a choice would I?  Were you wheepy with your periods?  Maybe it accentuates menstrual symptoms? I thought they were healthy too especially when compared to regular chips and stuff.  I\u2019m so going to eat them again to make sure that was the problem \u2018cause I so love Sun Chips. OK, that\u2019s just wrong that both you and I now have the munchies. I am so getting in my car to buy some Sun Chips. Has anyone else noticed that they smile at things these days that they don't know they would have really paid attention to before. I smile at the sound of birds singing, at interesting looking bugs crawling across the sidewalk, new leaves sprouting on the baby tree outside of my window, people zipping in and out of traffic, uncomfortable situations I would have avoided before, and at the thought of all who I am blessed to know. Thanks for making me smile. Walking on Sunshine, SIS Kimberly TTFN PS I bought new furniture for my office yesterday. I am sooo stoked.",

      "Content": "Aug 3, 2008 01:59PM SISKimberly wrote: Good Sunday Morning Jewels, You have all been busy. I've read all the posts...man, lots going on this past few days. College applications and admissions (D1, Norma, and Paula), getting ready for conferences and camping trips, 'cations overseas and closer to home (Paula, Carol,D1, Kathy, and Norma) preparing for a wedding shower and birthday parties (Sherry and Kathy), dodging earthquakes (good job saving the soup, LWDans, and if watching chandeliers swing was the worst of it Cathy, I'm glad for you ), worrying about loved ones (Ed and Denise), and coloring hair while losing eyebrows(D1 and Norma), finishing up rads (Carol and LJ13 is half way there-WhooHoo), and sporting new Foobies (take it really easy Jules).  So, Ashland was great! It was pretty smokey on the drive up especially from Chico on up, but it wasn't bad once we crossed the border into Oregon. We arrived after 5pm, checked in and cleaned up quickly so we could get some dinner before the play, View From the Bridge. We stay at a gorgeous B&B every year called Country Willows Inn. It is one of those places that just feels like coming home. We headed to our Spanish hangout, Zingarros, only to discover it is now Asian. Won't be going back. Very dissapointing. However, the play was fabulous, so it made up for the meal. Wednesday, after a wonderful breakfast at the Inn, we stopped at the market to pick up some cheese, fruit, and crackers for a picnic, then headed out to Medford and Jacksonville just to check it out, and then the Applegate area wineries.  Discovered one really great one (Schmidt- fabulous grounds where we ate our picnic), one good one (Fiasco - neat tasting room although not finished), and one that was just OK (something sword...see, can't even remember the name). We got back around 6pm, took an hour to just rest up and change, then headed to the Winchester  to see our favorite wine bar host, Andy. They have great food and wine tasting flights. The boys had the red flight and my gf and I split the Temperanillo flight. We weren't that impressed this time around, but the food was so good we didn't mind. Besides, we brought a bottle of Sea Smoke Pinot with us to share with Andy- who was very excited about that- so at least we had some really good wine before being disappointed. The boys liked their flights, so it must have just been the Temperanillo. Thursday, we lounged around. After breakfast, my gf and I went to replenish the picnic supplies knowing that we'd be lunching at the Inn that day. We read and hung out at the pool, had out picnic, took a nap, then headed out to dinner at the local French restaurant we'd made reservations for the night we arrived in town. Really good food and found a Spanish wine that retails for less than $10. The restaurant paired it with the pork and told us we could find it at their wine shop. Score!  The play, Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner was a new play about a woman who is really heavy and trying to lose weight. The set was great. A huge refrigerator on one end, a bed in front of that, the kitchen table in front of that, then the couch and TV, and a moving set that was the treadmill, the sister's bedroom, the bar, and the movie theater. It was all symbolic really...all the characters were dealing with self worth issues in some way or another. All in all, the message was how we need to stop taking on everyone elses stuff,deal with our own stuff by thinking about it rather than using some numbing device...food, sex, placating to be liked, TV, etc... I think the play needs to revisted by the writer and tweaked. The concept was really good, but many walked away-based on comments we heard leaving the theater-feeling unsure and unsatisfied. I thought there was a lot going on...many levels...but still, it needs some tweaking. Friday, we had different plans after breakfast and a little Bacci Ball. My gf and her man went to see Corialanus, an obscure Shakespearean Historical Tragedy while my dh and I went wondering around Ashland. We had lunch by the creek, Thai, so good and a peaceful setting. I found a pair of walking shoes, two skirts and a hat. I need to find a few shirts still. School shopping has begun. After their play, 3 hours, we went to the wine shop to get the Spanish wine we'd had the previous night. My dh and I had already been there and bought all the bottles,but one. We arranged to have the owner play a trick on our friends. He told them he only had one bottle, but that he could see if he could get more. He called my dh's cell and talked to him right in front of our friends. Unfortunately, our friends were busy looking at the wine around them and not even getting the joke being played on them. Once they realized it was us who had all the wine (six bottles), they got it. Of course we shared it with them. We got back to the Inn in time to change and have a little snack on the deck before heading out to our 8:30 dinner at Sammy's Cowboy Cafe...you'ld never suspect it was fabulous food from the name,would you? Anyway, it was a great trip, and I can't believe school starts in just a few weeks. So, we got another letter from the HOA regarding our extension of the driveway, which was in our original plans already submitted. They want a picture and a Completion form submitted. Geez....feeling a bit harrassed here.  Hopefully the meeting on the 12th will be the end of this. Gotta go and get more laundry going. SIS KImberly ",

We've got ladies still in radiation, some started Tamoxifin already, some are doing Herceptin,  and some are doing Arimidex.  So....you've got lots of people to get info and support from.  OK, gotta go to my PT appt.

The gal that cleans my house loved my desk. She told me her boyfriend's mother, in her 70's, has always wanted a rolltop desk. I told her if she could get it to her, it was hers.  She called her boyfriend, and he and his mom came to get it in their truck.

We might get a gallon of wine when it's all said and done. Afterwards, we took a 2.57 mile walk.  Carol's dh will arrive around 1:30 at the Sac. Airport, so we will go pick him up and do some tourist stuff in the Sacramento area. Carol's in the shower at the moment, so I'm next...it's hot here. Have a great Saturday Jewels, SIS Kimbelry ",

I so love that you went to places that most tourists wouldn't go...your small towns.  Hope the jetlag is under control soon. Does your dh have to go back to work tomorrow?  Speaking of your dh...hope you two had a chance to have some 'couple' time to talk. I know that you want to make a reconnection and often time 'cations are a great time as everyone is so relaxed and out of their normal routine. Joan, Carol got your information this morning. Thanks.  You are so welcome for the card from Chicago. You totally should go to visit your new friends. It is a fabulous city.  Paula, I am so jealous that your room is done already. I get to put my room together on Wednesday. I tried last week, but only got to do some curriculum work...running stuff off...and a little cleaning. My furniture was all stacked up on one side of the room. The carpets and linoleum had yet to be cleaned. I was assured it would be done this coming week by Wednesday, which is a good thing since school starts on Thursday for teachers.  Glad your college visits went well. It's our first try at making wine,so we won't know for 18 months if it's any good or not. Oh, and I made an error in the variety of grapes. We haven't picked the zinfandel yet, we picked the Merlot(pronounces Mer lo...the t is silent) and the Petite Syrah, so we will have a Petite Merlot or a Merlotah. The HOA has not backed down. We have to take the fence down. We took a pic in front of it so you can all at least see it before it's taken down.  We think we may have to invite the neighbors to our demolition party.  Kathy- How fun that your 'cation is just beginning.  Even though the kids and the dog are there, you've got lots of help with the grandparents and your friends being there, too.  Enjoy your days at the beach and by the pool.  We picked Carol's dh up close to 2pm at the airport after he returned his rental car (he'd been in Richmond on business). From there we took them on a tour of Sacramento. Drove by the capital and then had lunch in Old Town Sacramento, which Carol and her dh paid for. So sweet. From there we took a tour of the Fabulous 40's...a very nice residential area with some homes from the 30's and 40's, and then went to Whole Foods to get supplies for dinner. We had a braised pork tenderloin with baby potatoes, stuffing, green beans, and a really good Merlot. My son and his gf joined us for dinner. This morning, we woke around 8am or so and had coffee. I'd been keeping poor Carol up past her bedtime all week. We chatted, my new office furniture arrived, and then it was time for Carol and her dh to head out to Davis to visit their oldest college girl and her fiance. From there, they plan to spend two days in Napa playing golf and visiting a few wineries. It was sooo fabulous meeting Carol and her dh. Carol arrived bearing gifts of a Crab Cookbook, Smoked Salmon, organic capers, and cream cheese, organic salsa and two chip choices, crackers for cheese, and two bottles of wine (a Pinot Gris and a Pinot Noir). And then she wouldn't let me pay for lunch Thursday or Friday, and her dh wouldn't let us pay for lunch yesty. Am I spoiled or what? I'm thinking they enjoyed their B and D (Bed and Dinner) here in Lincoln, however. We had a great time. We've already planned a visit up to their place next summer at the beginning of July. We have several relatives and a friend from college in the Seattle/Tacoma area, so it will be a multipurpose trip. We hope to play golf together as Carol and I will both be in 'full swing' so to speak for sure by then. I'd better get lots of practicing in as I have a feeling she and her dh are pretty good. I've got only three more days before I'm back to work full time. I've got lots going on during those three days, too. Tomorrow, I have PT at 8am, lunch at 11:30 with my teacher friend who was diagnosed the same time I was, then a massage at 3pm. I have to SMOG my car sometime this week. Tuesday I have to take the car in to get the brakes, struts, springs, and other stuff looked at and fixed if needed. I'll drop the car off and spend the day with my twinsis. I have to be back by 6:30 for the appraiser. We want to refinance, but don't think the appraisal will be in our favor. If not, no big deal. Wednesday, I will be in my room all day getting it ready. Thursday, I'm back at school with meetings all day. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Part of me is really excited about getting back to school and part of me really likes being able to do what I want to do when I want to do it. Tata for now ladies. SIS Kimberly   ",

I like the people that worked on my car when i lived in Folsom, so I drive back there when I need to), so I was with my sis all day. Then I took dinner to a neighbor who just had a baby, and finally stopped to say hey to a neighborgal who is doing her student teaching in 6th grade in Rocklin and just started with kids today. Tomorrow it's getting the car smoged and off to set up my classroom. D1- I am so impressed with your catching up on all the posts. Well Done. You deserve a nice cool g and t.  Glad to hear that you at least made an attempt at being harem like with your sheik, and equally glad you could both laugh at the not so perfect execution.   Sounds like dd#2 is up for a really busy and intense school year with those classes, but with her scores and drive, I know she will do just fine. College...seems that many of our Jewels are taking kids to college in the next few weeks and/or do college tours for kiddos getting ready for college. What an exciting time for your young adults. It's late and I'm exhausted, so I'm just going to say hey to LJ13, CathyCa, Sherry, and Kathy. I've read your posts, but just can't muster up the energy to do shout outs.  Man, I can just imagine what I'll feel like after being in school all day if being out doing what I did tired me out. Take care all, SIS KImberly ",

Up until 12:30 or so, finally fell asleep about 1am or so. Got up at 6:30, showered, emptied the dishwasher, had a pear and a slice of toast with PB on it, then got my little 'stang to the SMOG place. I was second in line at 8am, and we had to wait for the machine to warm up, then I'd be done in 40 minutes maybe an hour, so I took myself walking up into old town Lincoln. Stopped for a coffee (forgot to tell her decaf...whew I was flying...). I bought a great tall breast cancer ceramic mug with a travel lid on it while there and also got a breakfast sandwich thinking I'd be working hard today and would need more than a pear and a slice of toast. I sat and ate, read the local rag, and sipped my coffee for a good 30 minutes before walking back to the SMOG place. Got to school at 9:05 just ahead of my helpers.  We put all the furniture back, cleaned off shelving units, filled them with books and stuff, did bulletin boards, and laminated posters. My room looks great. I just have a few things left to do to make the room work on Friday, and then I have the rest of Friday and most of Monday to work on curriculum. Kids arrive on Tuesday.   So, D1, you are right about being glad to have a weekend to recoup this week, then it's four days next week as I'll be leaving Friday for my annual girl getaway to Ashland over the Labor Day holiday, and after that it's another four day week.   By the way, I got my post card today from Dubrovnik...beautiful looking little oceanfront town.When we were in Italy, we drove to the East side so we could stick our toes in the Adriatic since we were staying on the Mediterranian side. I'm with you and Kathy about the nails thing. Mine haven't fallen off, but like Kathy's are just so weak and break at the drop of a hat down to the quick. I have to keep them really short. Kathy, doesn't Herceptin have an effect on hair growth?  Like D1's Tamox break allowing her eyebrows and hair to grow faster, I would think  that drugs that mess with any part of our hormones/metabolism effects cell regeneration. Cathy, and soon D1, the empty nest thing is not something I experienced. I don't know why. It isn't llike I was thrilled and ready for Jon to move out or anything, I guess I was just OK with him wanting to move on with his life. We tallk a lot and see eachother often now, and even when he first moved out, it wasn't a total cut off feeling.  Maybe had he gone really far from home it would have been different.  I am sorry that Christina Applegate, especially being so young, was diagnosed with breast cancer. I am glad she felt she made the right choice having a bilateral mastectomy. I'm pleased she has a sense of humor about it all. I'm worried that she isn't doing other treatment options because she wanta to have a baby someday, but then I don't know the extent of her cancer other than it was insitu and BRACA positive. Maybe a bilat is all she needed if they caught it really early, and there was no node involvement.  I didn't see the interview with Robin Roberts, but I read others were upset on this site about her saying she was 100% cured as they felt she made cancer sound like a breeze to get though since she was in 'treatment' for a month. Personally, everyone has their journey, and hers just happened to not be as long as some of ours, but that doesn't make her journey any less valid. I'm heading to my chair and my heating pad. I have to be at work at 8am tomorrow. SIS Kimberly ",

Zach has been through a lot this past year, and this may be his way of acting out, but he's also 16, so it's really hard to tell what's going on with him. What was his response to your putting the idea out there? I think it's a great idea that you will be 'on top of Zach' so to speak. I truly believe that jr. and sr.high are the ages kids need their parents at home more than when they are in elementary. This is a huge transition time for kids. Thanks for the pics. You took some that we didn't, so these will be a good addition to ours. The movie, Bottle Shock,was based on true events and was pretty darned good. It was about how the California wine industry beat out the French in a taste test in France in 1976 and then again in 2006. The French were not happy either time. It was shown in an old theater from the 50's, maybe as old as the 40's in Sacramento. Hope you slept well. I'm thinking I need a good night's sleep as well tonight. Good night Jewels, SIS Kimberly ",

WHooHoo!!!  It's been a crazy busy last few days.  I've been home after 6pm every night and this weekend, I was at a conference called Healing Journeys. It focuses on all kinds of cancer and the guest speakers were great.  One was a doctor in Florida who developed the 7 Steps of Healing after his father died of cancer. He felt his dad's doctors were not treating the whole person only his disease, so he created a whole new protocol.  Another speaker was a nutritionist and another a Yoga master who does yoga for cancer patients, but also promotes yoga in prisons and with at risk youth with much success in lowering their stress and helping them deal with their negative emotions.  Fun.   I also did a little shopping I have jury duty this next week. I have to call at 11am to see if I have to go in or not.  It's not easy being a teacher and leaving on a moments notice, however. I plan to call at 9am (my student teacher can start the class) and find out how I can find out if I'm needed or not before 11am. I've read all the posts and was glad to hear from Kris, Norma, and Therese. Good to hear from you ladies. Life has been keeping you all entertained, I see.  D1- I was so sorry to hear about your sister.  What a crappy thing to have to wait for the tests for over a week and then for the results afterwards.  I hope that her cancer has not returned.   Paula - I was also sorry to hear about Ed's seizure.  It appears he's doing better this weekend. Good to hear.  I'm sure you'll find someone to help your dd out with Ed while you're gone. Sherry - That's awesome that you're going to walk a 5k. Good for you!  So, are you wearing gel supports in your shoes at work? That might help take the pressure off your back a bit. OK, I know I haven't been really talkative. Sorry.  Life has just been crazy busy with grading papers, creating curriculum, keeping up with creating Power Points for each day, mentoring my student teacher, excercising daily, and teaching of course.  (I lost three pounds last week).  I'm hoping to get a day when I'm doing nothing really soon...maybe next Sunday. Sat. is a wedding.  I'll try to sneak a peak during the week.  In the meantime, take care gals. SIS Kimberly ",

Lots going on.  My twinsis does have cancer...exactly the same kind in the right breast (mine was the left).  I'm just in shock.  I so didn't want to hear this news.  Her doc said we shouldn't be suprised. We're twins and she had a much greater risk than other women of getting it especially with my Dad having had it.  Yeah, but that doesn't make it any easier to swallow.  Thanks Carol for being such a great ear tonight.  A quick answer for LJ13- I had a nurse case manager so to speak. I have Blue Shield.  She wasn't working for Blue Shield per se, but her company was hired to be a mediary between myself and my insurance if needed.  She was invaluable as I went through treatment as she answered questions and checked on things regarding covereage for me. She checked in with her supervisor, a doctor, who reviewed cases based on information gathered during the weekly conversation.  She sent me articles if I wanted her to do that.  I'm just wondering why you have a case manager after the fact? Love you gals. Thanks for all the best wishes for my twinsis. I told here we were all sending out good thoughts...and who knows, those good thoughts may have been what helped her get the news so quickly after the biopsy, so she can get this taken care of quickly.

This was a 7th grade class I was referring to in my post.  Thanks for the reminder of your previous diagnosis. So, did you opt for a TRAM again on the other breast? Again, I know you've said this before, but I forgot.  If so, are you happy with the results?  My sis may have to think about that as an option.  Four kitties happily laying in window sills and sunshine. Nice!!!! Have a great walk. Written on the spot as I sit in my home office looking out the window on this first day of November, 2008. It's raining outside, and raindrops  patter upon the roof, and swoosh through the downspout, then careen down into the storm drain to be reclaimed for other uses.  Can you hear them, the raindrops, screaming with delight, like children on a roller coaster eager to run, wait in line, and do it again?  It reminds me that those curve balls life is fond of throwing my way, are mearly opportunities to reclaim experiences I may have ignored, or let fly by because I was too afraid or unprepared to catch them, I may want to approach them with more delight and a glove.

Can't wait to see the end results. Therese, bummer about the respitory bug in your house. Hope you can get back to your training this week, but if not, take it easy and rest, there's always next week. I like the resort idea too.  I do think the dates are set, we just need to find a place, and a package would be even better if we can get one. Carol- I had my class listen to the speech yesterday morning on NPR. I agree, what a moment!  Paula, glad Ed's doing better in some respects. Nice that you got to delay school so students could watch the inaugeration.  You must live close to work to be beebopping back and forth from home to work and back.  Sorry you're being hunted by the bug...hopefully, it isn't the strain I got...I'm on the tail end, but it's hanging on like a pitbull. Carla, good news about the dh trying to treat you and the girls with more respect and kindness.  Maybe now would be a good time to hit him up for counseling since he'll do anything to keep you at home.  Understanding the dynamic and making change isn't like quitting smoking cold turkey, a professional can really help.   Can't wait to meet you and all the Jewels that can get to LV. Gotta run to a staff meeting this morning.  Have a great day all.  President Obama and his family must be exhausted this morning after all the partying yesterday.  Can't wait to hear from D1 to get the on the scene report.

I just cried...tears streaming down my face... for you reading your good news. I finally heard from the oncology office... they wanted to tell me that the chemo nurse will call me today to set up my first chemo...I'm assuming next week...and to tell me that I'll have a copay with every treatment-which I knew-and that I'd be needing to pick up my prescription for Decadron (sp) by Friday and that after my first chemo, I'd have to come back at get a shot of D1 OLE's favorite drug Neulestra(sp). Whoopie for me. MAZ- Welcome...we have the same chemotini recipe on the same schedule...don't know when my first day is yet...I already have my port...did it at the same time as my bilat- so I'll probably start next week. We are a great group...you'll love chatting here. Kathy-Ooo La La. Sexy Kathy has new bras from Victoria Secret. How fun!!!!! So, your exhange happened pretty quickly since you haven't even started chemo yet...that's nice. I go in for my 100cc fill up today. Why, I'm just blossoming right before my very own eyes. :-) My exchange won't happen for quite awhile...I have to complete chemo and rads first. Carol-Thanks again for reading my poetry and letting me know it touched you. That means a lot. I like the idea of a list, too. I've cut down the number of threads I get involved with as it was just getting overwhelming. I now focus on the JJ's, Hijack This Thread, plus Poetry Anyone?, which I started. I figure between all of us, we can find all the answers we need, so I only read posts if the topic intrigues me...but hardly do that at all anymore. I'm addicted to the Jewels. Welcome Dana- As Kathy stated, sorry you had to join the club...but we're a great group of gals...you couldn't have found a more supportive group. I know...it is overwhelming isn't it? Deep breath...and one step at a time. Kath is right, with positive nodes...it will be chemo for you, but the chemo of even a few years ago is not the same as it is today. There are so many ways your doctors can help you fight the side effects, so they don't knock you over the way they did your brother...and yes, the drugs for lung cancer are far different...more potent...like those used for other major organ cancers. Well, better go eat something, get in the shower, and head out to my fill up appt. My son will take me today. I'm going to ask if I can drive yet...I did take a very short about a mile or so without the docs blessing...but haven't attempted anything farther. PS-Julie we must have been posting at the exact same time...I read your mind? Who knew I had such a talent? Your SIS(Sister In Survival) Kimberly",

Dana, I know you aren't thrilled with your test results, but as you've heard...you've got a lot of good research backing the success of treatment for you. CathyC gives good advice...take care of contacting the billing departments of your medical facilities and other debts now before you get behind. Put together a budget and let them know what you can afford. Get that letter Cathy did from your oncologists office to send to each creditor that isn't a medical bill. I also like the suggestion about contacting the Dr. in LA about clinical trials...doesn't hurt to see what the options are out there. YuYu- Glad to hear from you and that you seem to be doing well. I go for my final fill up, 1/28, the day before my 2nd tx 1/29. Yeah, that really tight feeling isn't always so comfortable is it? I had the stuffy ear thing along with my soft palat(sp) feeling like it was going to rip in half when i opened my mouth too wide...like to eat a sandwich or yawn...but it only lasted 3 or 4 days...it's much better now. PALady- WhooHoo on the balditude!!!! Good for you. Looks like Julie, Vettegal, and I are all ready to have our shaving parties sooner rather than later. I'm thinking this weekend sounds like a good time. I agree the second infusion will send those follicals screaming right off my head, so I might as well give them a head start (pun intended) ;-) Paula, I'm sending lots of positive energy out into the universe for both you and your hubby. I'm glad he's up and around although wiped out. Again, SHERO!!!! CHJ- Didn't I say you would love this group? I'm so glad you're here with us. I'm totally with you on the ease factor of being hairless...looking forward to that perk. Kathy-I'm sorry about your friend. Funerals can be emotionally draining, and to have to do that and then fend for yourself tonight...be good to yourself when the kids are down for the night...light some candles, take a bubble bath, have a nice glass of wine and just unwind. Hey ArizonaDeb- Good luck with your next treatent. I've not heard of The Tudors...is it an HBO series? Hope your tx goes by faster- in perception anyway as you can't rush those drips- having that to watch. LJ13- I love MahiMahi...organic section of the store...I'll have to check that out...I hate farmed fish. Hey DianaB. Sounding upbeat and perky today. OK, if I've missed anyone, I apologize...take care gals. SIS Kimberly",

And I agree...we Jewels are the best thing we could have as part of our treatment plan. Joan- So sorry to hear about your mom being in the hospital. Did you and your family decide on if you'll place her in a care facility or continue caring for her at home when she's released? Man, it is so tough caring for your own family, but to add the care of an aging parent and bc on top of it ...WOW. I know you'll pull through all of this just fine. It is amazing how we women rise to the occasion and just do what needs to be done. You'll look back on this in 6 months or so, and think, how did I do all of that? Answer: Because you're a survivor and you've got the Jewels backing you up. Sunshine, Judy, and Joan- The first one is the most anxiety provoking because you don't know what to expect. As KathyL stated...go back and read all the posts, take notes, and know that we're all here for you. Go kick Cancer booty!!! (((HUGS))))) for all of you. There are no sissy's here...only Sisters in Survival. Therese- Glad to hear from you. It's been awhile. I understand that some people aren't real big 'talkers', but so glad you keep up with the posts and chime in when you feel up to it. Sorry tx 2 was such a beast, but glad you're feeling really good today. WhooHoo! Paula- Aren't the good days...GOOD!!!! So glad you had such a great day yesterday. I'm ready to kick some cancer butt. Carol- Thanks for answering my questions. I'll let you know what my onc says about the hysterectomy. You'd be proud of me...got up today and did some exercises. Different kinds of leg lifts, sit ups, and stretches. I plan to do it again tonight. Good for you being able to keep that 13 pounds off. Yeah, I do think the alcohol consumption is a big calorie thing. Once I'm done, I'll have to keep it to one glass of wine instead of two with dinner when we have it. KathyL- You and I are struggling with the same battle. I'm 154 today. I'm 5'8\" and my highest weight had been 160. I want to be 140-145. I know the steriods and constipation can cause water retention, but I peed a lot last night after being on steroid am and pm yesterday. I agree we need to move more and get more excercise to facilitate our goals. I'm there to support you, girl! PALady- Thanks for the shout out. Hope you're feeling better by the end of the day. Sometimes a walk in the fresh air does wonders. CHJ- Eat!!!! Even when you don't want to...small meals throughout the day. A yogurt and a handful of wheat thins is a meal. Applesauce and a slice of peanut butter toast is a meal. You need your strength to keep your immune system strong. LJ13- You're a tiny little thing aren't you. You certainly can't afford to be losing weight. Glad to hear your next treatment won't have the icky effects your AC seemed to have. I'm doing all three TAC at once, so good luck with that. OK, so speaking of food...I need to eat so I can take my steriods, my digestive discomfort prevention meds- Pepcid AC and Gas X before treatment at 10am. I've got my cape, my chemotini glass, and my baldacioius balditude...I'm ready!!!! SIS Kimberly",

I plan to do a lot of resting today...have a Frankie Vallie concert tonight...a Christmas gift from friends(didn't know chemo schedule at the time) who we saw Jersey Boys with last summer. Hope I'll be up for it. Carol- I am so sorry to hear of the loss of your daughter's fiance's father and your family friend's mom...a lot to bear in only 48 hours. 6 weeks of rads...I don't even get to meet the radiologist until April, my last chemo month. I so don't want to deal with 6 weeks every day...I wonder how it is determined? 4-6 weeks is what I've heard the range seems to be. HeyARDeb- Glad to hear from you. I'll bet you're whooped every day after work. No wonder you've been in cognito. Take care of you and get all the rest you need to do what you need to get done in your world. We're glad to hear from you when you can check in with us. Thinkin' of you. Kathy-How great to have a girls day! Your friend is lucky to have you with her.., being a head of her in the reconstruction process means she can have a confident she can ask all kinds of questions of...and of course, you can show her how beautiful her new girls will look in the future! I've got a long ways before my exchange, but that's OK. One day at a time. Have a great lunch with your other friend, too. No living in bubbles on a good days...that's my motto. Oh, good point about the Taxotere causing water retention...I'm so hoping that's what my gain is about. CarolC-Man, what a pain in the butt dealing with computer viruses. I have a mac at home, and I have never had a virus. Knock on wood. Glad to hear your se's are not bugging you this week...except for the hair...but that's just a temporary blip in this journey. wvgirl- Bummer that a phone call interupted your conversation. Did the dh seem receptive at all to your talking about things? Was he listening and contributing? Sometimes too much at once can be overwhelming, so that phone call came as a needed break I imagine. If you wasn't receptive, I don't know what to say...he's going to be a tough nut to crack...but keep trying. Hope work gives you a place to get some support. Vettegal- I wasn't told not to wear tampons. I use a product called Instead. It's like a diaphram, only disposable. I didn't have any issues at all, and I just had my period last week. Joan- WhooHoo! One down! Glad it wasn't too bad. Keep ahead of those se's. Hope the Neulasta shot is kind to you. I've had two and haven't had major issues at all. Have a good day. I'll check in later. SIS Kimberly PS Hey, Kris, LJ13, and CHJ- you all must have been posting at the same time as me. Glad to hear from you. Kris, sorry about the illness on top of chemo. That rock in your gut...chemo would be my guess. We all experience that delightful sensation. Hang in there. LJ13- I had a bilat and nodes removed, and within a few days I could type on the computer, but found my arms pretty sore after a bit. Take breaks. CHJ- Whoohoo on getting back to work. Have a good time at lunch, even if you aren't interested in the food.",

This morning, I feel almost human..still weak, but not like I'd been run over by a Mack Truck. I didn't experience the digestive stuff as badly as I did with the 1st infusion since I was prepared with my preventative measures (Pepcid AC, Gas X, Miralax), but still experienced that rock in the gut feeling 24/7, and if you can imagine Sigourney Weaver in Alien, and what that must have felt like to have an alien spring forth from your gut..yeah...that about sums it up. I was more weak, achy, and just needing to sleep a lot this time around. Not much of an appetite, but knowing I need to eat, I've forced myself to graze. I've lived on applesauce, toast, Wheat Thins, and scrambled eggs. Oh, scrambled eggs taste so good. Yesterday, I ate a little grilled chicken and apple slices for lunch, and last night, I had a craving for white rice with butter (memories from childhood) ...which meant a trip to the store... Greg also made me some steamed carrots and leftover chicken from lunch. May I just say...AGAIN...I am the luckiest woman on the planet...dare I say in the universe... to have this man of mine in my life!!!! This morning....ohhh.... hot chocolate with Almond Milk, since I shouldn't have soy anymore. So much better than just watery beverages ...a bit rich, so only one cup for me-- and a little applesauce of course. NEWS FLASH!!!! My recently buzzed In the Army Now hairdo has become truly an Uncle Fester spectacular. Greg laughed the other day that I needed to vaccume my pillow. My pillow had its own five o'clock shadow going. Hahaha. (By the way, I did wash the sheets, pillows, and pillow covers for those of you out there saying...Ewww. ) In between bouts of sleeping and feeling genuinely like well...c#@p, I finished the book I started last week and watched more sappy Danielle Steele movies on WEtv than I care to admit to watching...the good news, you can nap and not miss much. Needless to say, the creative juices have not been flowing, so there have been no new writings springing forth. We'll see what the new week brings. I've tried to attach a few photos of SuperGirl. Greg secretly caught me in the act of flying...hehehe I have a Mac, and apparently this site isn't liking my browser. I'll have to have Greg use the PC and upload them.

Hopefully, they can get me in today or early this week...and the sun is shining!!!!!! Man has the hair been falling out this past few days or what? Congrats fellow baldacious babes!!!! Welcome to the club. Kathy- Glad your dh got over his pms and helped you with the shave...I agree with D1 get those nurses on the line and get that anemia taken care of immediately. Aren't you taking the NastyLasta? My numbers were actually a bit higher before my 2nd tx than before my 1st. It must be doing its job. D1- I love egg sandwiches...but need to put goat cheddar as I'm allergic to milk. I am so doing that for lunch. You know, I've wanted salt, too. I think you're right...it's because I can taste it... and normally, I hate salty things. The dh bought some 'healthy' potatoe chips (mix of sweet potatoes and regular) and they really had no flavor except the little bit of salt...to my taste bud challenged mouth anyway. I found some great small ginger snaps in the organic section that are pretty good. I can taste them, and they are good for the tummy. All you Jewels on the se train...I'm at the top of the hill rooting for you. Hang in there!!!! wvgirl-I am so glad that your bro was able to be there for you. Like I said yesterday, you may have to get your support and hugs from him since the DH is so darn clueless...but, like D1 said, he may need time to just process what you've said to him. Vettegal and Kathy-My period wasn't any different as far as time or heaviness...crampier, but not too bad. I am so sorry you both experienced such horrid periods...no wonder you're both wiped out. Hope chemopause sets in before the next one has a chance to even think about it. CHJ- Your cat is so cute!!!!! And as I said earlier, welcome to the baldacious babes club.

Maz- I\u2019ll be watching how you\u2019re doing on Tx 3 as mine is coming up on 2/19\u2026I\u2019d say that days 4-6 aren\u2019t great\u2026the rest are pretty good\u2026just tiring. From day 11 on are really doable. CathyCa- WhooHoo that you\u2019re going to be our dermatology go to gal. Excellent that you\u2019ll have lots to share with us. Vettegal- Bummer that you\u2019ve lost power so many times today. I\u2019m assuming all is well now. Hey, Carol, maybe Jenn51 is having power outage issues. I couldn\u2019t agree with you more Vettegal about not being to do this alone. Personally, I don\u2019t believe in coincidences\u2026I truly believe we all found this site and this thread because we needed to find each other and do this together. You gals are such a blessing\u2026no matter how much our friends and family may want to be there to support us, there is nothing like being in touch with others who know exactly what you\u2019re going through. I raise my glass to D1 for having the drive to start her own thread since she felt the December group was too far ahead of her and to all or you for being members of this Jewel family. Sounds like you had a great time last night at dinner\u2026and that you\u2019re handling being a baldacious babe better now that it is done. I just spent some time outside in my jimmies and my bald head talking with the neighbors and watching the kids outside playing\u2026I\u2019m sure anyone driving by who didn\u2019t know me was thinkin\u2019\u2026OK, she\u2019s the crazy woman of the neighborhood\u2026hahaha. I had just taken a really long walk and was ready to settle in to read when the neighbors knocked and invited me out to set and hang out. Who cares if I\u2019m back in my jams eh? wvgirl-Hey, glad you popped in for a little shout out!!! Julie- I second that teachers can\u2019t go in the Fall\u2026summer sounds good to me\u2026June \u201909 early so I can do my exchange afterwards and not miss school. Are your migraines hormone-or lack of hormone-triggered? Is there anything you can do about them before they get too bad? I feel so badly for you gals in the Mid-East and East\u2026sorry you\u2019re having such cold weather while we are having sunshine\u2026we have a storm front moving in next week if that helps make you feel any better. Paula- I didn\u2019t even know they had a chemotherapy shampoo. I\u2019ll check out that website. Thanks for the headsup---hahaha. Joan- How funny that your sub is a man, too. I\u2019m so glad that more men are getting into the teaching field. It has been really heavy on the estrogen for a really long time\u2026and so many kids need good male role models. Glad you got a wig you like. It will help to have that ready to go when the time comes for the big shave. Kathy- Glad to hear you sound better and are able to just take it easy today. Thank goodness for mom\u2019s/grandmoms and dh\u2019s that pitch in when you need it most. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019re feeling up to a little lovin\u2019 on Valentines Day, too. There\u2019s nothing that compares to that endorphin rush nor that feeling of connecting with our spouses as well as a good lovin\u2019session\u2026and your dh will be thrilled with his gift for sure. ;-) Bummer about the cruise\u2026sea sickness is not fun. OK, what about an all inclusive resort? CHJ- First off, I\u2019m thinking spouses should be allowed to go on our trip if they want to come along. Afterall, they are part of this journey, too, and they certainly can\u2019t say they have nothing in common\u2026hello, the Jewels. But, a weekend getaway could be a nice, too. Good luck to our gals bellying up to the chemotini bar tomorrow\u2026and a big Happy Birthday to our D1. SIS Kimberly",

I have a friend who married a second time and had a baby at 42 as her second husband hadn\u2019t ever been married or had kids. She\u2019s amazing keeping up with an 11 year old now at 54 (b-day in Jan), and she\u2019s got two grown kids, a granddaughter and another on the way. I\u2019m glad you shared that good news\u2026babies are always just the thing to get ya smilin\u2019. And I agree about getting to work and doing your job being enough physical exertion. I know I couldn\u2019t work and then exercise on top of it at this point. Dana- Thanks for sharing those lyrics\u2026sounds like The Secret, which I have seen and read, has been a big eye opener for you\u2026and love that the very next day it revealed itself to you!!!!!! The only part of The Secret I didn\u2019t like was the focus on material things\u2026but the overarching message is the truth. Paula- I\u2019m glad the snow kept to the north of you and that you got at least four hours of sleep, but bummer about that cough in the first place. Are you feeling like you\u2019re on the tail end? Valentines Day can be celebrated anytime you want\u2026avoid the crowds that way if you decide to go out. :-) My stuffy head isn\u2019t too bad this morning\u2026I\u2019ll keep doing the EmergenC. My eyes feel heavy and tired though\u2026what\u2019s with that? I guess that could be sinus pressure? CarolC- Isn\u2019t that interesting that people who are on the fringes or just know someone who went through chemo \u2018just fine\u2019 feel they know what its like? Were those people she knows going to work during chemo? I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that attitude and feeling puny. Your se\u2019s are what is to be expected of Day 4/5. Hang in there. I didn\u2019t know red, blotchy, and itchy was a symptom of neuropathy\u2026numbness and tingling, I thought. Hmmmm, and you\u2019re off to work this morning\u2026SHERO!!!! Wendy- There does seem to be a cumulative effect, but then again we are all so different\u2026you could have an easier go of it like your first. If not, we are here for you. Good luck tomorrow. What is Avistan? Taxotere treatments once each week for 12 weeks? Are these low dose, but lots over time? I\u2019m doing TAC for 6 rounds once every 21 days then rads. Interesting the different treatment plans out there. ARDeb-Sorry you\u2019ve been down for the count\u2026but the fact you checked in means you must be on the downhill slide\u2026and then off to the chemotini lounge again on Friday? I hear you on the supplemental insurance. Glad you have that to fall back on when the sick leave runs out. Hang in there and cuddle up. Oh, those tornadoes were something from the news coverage\u2026I\u2019m glad your house wasn\u2019t in the path. Triple Neg\u2026so does that change your treatment plan at all? Will Herceptin be added like our other triple neg gals have mentioned? Hope everyone has a fabulous Tuesday!!!! Good luck today Kris\u2026looks like Dana isn\u2019t joining you afterall.

If you haven\u2019t tried Cystix\u2026I think that\u2019s what it\u2019s called\u2026it\u2019s great for relieving that gotta go feeling. D1-I\u2019m so glad you and the college girl arrived home safely\u2026and how cute that she and her younger sis are so close that they still giggle together\u2026a testament to good parenting. Enjoy your time\u2026I know that you were concerned it being a post chemo weekend, but I\u2019ll bet you guys have a great time together no matter what the se\u2019s bring on. Paula- I am so glad your counts were fine and that being sick didn\u2019t throw you off chemo schedule. Get some good sleep tonight\u2026and keep resting all weekend!!!! Carol- That\u2019s very wise of the kids to wait until they finish their college educations before tying the knot\u2026and another nurse in our midst\u2026well, starting school this summer anyway\u2026that\u2019s great! Thanks for mailing the tshirts\u2026I too have a Large available to anyone who wants it. Jenn- Glad you were able to eat out\u2026and totally understand wanting to eat when you can finally taste the food!!!! So, I too tried eye drops\u2026another thing my onc told me to try. It did seem to help, so maybe I don\u2019t need to see the eye doc afterall. We\u2019ll see how it goes over the next few days. Good questions- I\u2019m thinking once treatment is over\u2026you can call yourself a survivor. Of course, if treatment means just surgery, then that\u2019s when you start the countdown\u2026if it\u2019s surgery and chemo, the end of chemo. If it\u2019s surgery, chemo, and rads\u2026then that\u2019s the countdown. Now\u2026how do we handle the Herceptin gals? With that being a year long commitment\u2026do we count that like those of us having to take HT? I think, yes. Once chemo and rads are done, we start the count down. Personally, I think when I found you Jewels is when I started my healing journey. Well, heck a few of you gals were composing at the same time as I was...wvgirl-WhooHoo...progress with both the lump and the husband!!!! Glad you're finding the support group helpful. Deb and Julie- Glad you both made it through and totally understand the need to lurk this weekend...take it easy and take care of yourselves. Don't get sick Deb...hope your partner gets well real soon. Sleep tight, Jewels, SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2008 02:04PM - edited Mar 1, 2008 03:44PM by SISKimberly Morning Jewels, The sun is shining again...whoohoo!!!! Well, as you can see, I didn't get back to see you all last night. Big day...did laundry, then took my son to lunch, and joined my staff for a meeting that lasted 2 hours regarding our direction for next year. We've grown so much. Our school was built for 850 students or so, we now have over 1000. Next year we anticipate 1100. We have added 6 portables, and may have to add two more...which means we've got no space to add another building even if needed. Our classes will all be packed to 34 and PE will be as high as 45 to 50...that's too many in one class. AHHH!!!! It was so good to see everyone though. Sheshe- Can't tap...no problem...I just love to dance...so we can just let the music guide us!!!! Bummer about the Look Good Feel Good class... that gal didn't seem to care if you felt good about driving an hour for nothing... maybe, she was having a bad day herself...not that having a bad day makes it right to not notify participants of a class cancellation. I decided to do the Adriamycin when asked if I wanted to do TC or TAC. My onc stated I have a strong heart, and they'd be watching it carefully. He stated, and I agree, \" Kimberly, you're a go getter, and I don't want you to be saying down the line if the cancer should recur, I should have done the Adriamycin.\" With Stage 3, he wanted to be real aggressive. I will ask for a MUGA scan after this is over to see if all is still as healthy as it was before, however. Julie- WhooHoo on feeling good. The sun being out was a huge bonus!!!! Wishing your son good luck in his Tae Kwon Do tourney.  Martial arts is such a great thing for kids...really helps them find their center and focus. Didn't make it shopping yesterday. I'll do that next week. Dana- Hey, Little Warrior, I with you on being able to beat down a little ole 1cm tumor in the liver and any other escapee cells no problem. Wow, who's reimbursing your premiums from Dec 07- May 09? That's so great. Then after May, you'll pay the premiums?  That is a blessing since you'll be done with school by then and have a job. My money is on you, Cute Dana. Keep up that positive outlook...it does pay off. Carol- What a bummer in your mailbox! So, could your surgeon or oncologist write a letter to your insurance company stating that the sleeve is needed to prevent lymphodema considering the number of nodes removed? I'm with you on fighting this one. Remind them the money saved by preventing rather than reacting after the clots and swelling appear. Hope you had a great meal out...I love Sushi! Wish I could have had a drink for you last night...tried a sip of the dh's wine...BLAH...the end of next week, right before chemo I'll be able to taste wine again. WhooHoo. Vettegal- I had a real light period the week of my last chemo (Feb), so I'm hoping I won't have one this month. No wrinkly fingers. Have a good day...bummer you have to work on a Sat. but like you said the overtime pay will be nice. Oh, and eyebrows and lashes are thinning for sure. Kathy- Number three seems to be the @*s kicker for lots of us...sure kicked my butt. Take care of yourself...hope the fog doesn't get too thick. Wvgirl- I'm so glad the dh is starting to come around...little by little. And you know what...reading to him if he won't read the book himself might help you connect more as a couple. Let him know that other men have been where he is and that hearing this might be helpful to you both. That's great that you're so involved with the Relay For Life. I did that for a few years when it was done at our school right after one of our teachers passed away of lung cancer in her early 40's. It outgrew our space and moved somewhere else. Breast cancer at 15? Wow...that's something you don't hear every day. Makes you hope that every teenage girl knows how important it is to do self exams. Therese- Last one!!!!!! Congratulations. I'm so glad you were able to take your dd and friends to a concert and really enjoy it with them. She'll remember that. Interesting about the Taxotere causing \u2018muscle spasms/flu-like achiness, & even arthritis-like joint pain in my hands & shoulders'. So between that and the NastyLasta, no wonder some of our gals are really having a hard time. Take care as you head into the fog. I'll see ya later gals, SIS Kimberly ",

That's our story, and we're sticking to it. Julie- We must have posted at the same time yesterday. That's great that your son did so well. 1st and 2nd are nothing to sneeze at...isn't that a funny expression...what does that mean? Anyway, 70 degrees...and you were stuck inside. Shoot. Opening up the curtains and finding a warm spot is the next best thing, so hopefully that's what you did. Isn't it amazing how one big outing can tire you out forcing a rest day the following day? 2500 students on one campus? OMG!!!! Sista- LOL about playing the lottery regularly. I play once in awhile...actually, a lottery ticket fell out of something in my dream last night...maybe I'm supposed to play this week. Kathy-Wow, I'm impressed that you're out of the fog and functioning...fairly well anyway. Open all those curtains and let that sunshine in. You should be doing much better later in the week when that 60 degree weather arrives...and maybe getting right out in it will be just the ticket! LOL about telling your friend all about the reaction, and she was there with you. HaHaHa. Oh, your pics are great!!!! You're beautiful even without makeup, girl! Are those little munchkins cute or what?  YES!!!! 38 in December, eh? You're a pup. I'll be 47 in June. Carol- I'm sorry you are dealing with insurance idiots. I think the goal is to use smoke and mirrors, and to confuse us so that we pay the bill thinking it really is our part. Good for you not falling for it. I say make a photocopy of the primary and secondary insurance cards, attach to bill, and mail it back. Hey, that would be fun to do the walk together. I'm not much for camping either, but I'd do it for the Jewels. Yes, dh does play golf, too. It is nice to play together or with others. CathyCa- I totally understand needing to keep insurance going. That's great that the ds is taking a wide variety of classes, and that he likes horticulture, for now. Community college is the perfect place to explore and discover what is out there. I have a case nurse through Blue Shield who keeps tabs on me, too. Don't know about running interference for insurance stuff or not as I've not had issues....yet. Dana- That is awesome about the BCC Medical program. And, you were a busy little warrior...no wonder you're tired. Hope your got a good night's rest. 38, you're still a puppy, too ...and I love that you know you're getting cuter. I do believe that as I age, I just get better and better in so many ways.  Humility is overrated. Hahaha. Thinking about you as you prepare for tomorrow's visit to the chemotini lounge. D1- Welcome back. No need to apologize for the choppy approach...we all know and understand the groggy brain feeling. Oh, I totally understand what you mean about twisting the bones on the turkey...good analogy. OUCH!!!! That is great that your onc was receptive to your poll of the Jewels. I'm looking forward to hearing about your decision on rads. I read a long study that looked at other studies on bilateral mastectomy and rads, and feel confident that with Stage 3a and node involvement, I don't have a choice. Darn! Not looking forward to my very fair skin being burned by radiation.  Got the calendula cream on my list and heard something about Aquafer (sp) too. Paula- Hope you have a great ½ day with your students. I'll check in to see how it went tonight. Go get \u2018em Sheshe!!!! Hey Sista, you must have been posting at the same time as I was.  I was told that you can expect your body to take as many months as you did chemo and rads to recoup.  You will always want to wear the highest SPF from now on when out in the sun. I've personally never been a lay in the sun girl.  I will for short bursts, but usually am under an umbrella or some kind of shade if at the beach with friends or family...man I haven't been to the beach in awhile.  Need to make a trip for sure.  SIS Kimberly",

They have this great Treatment Tools section that matches your dx to different tx's, discusses side effects, and offers research based on your dx. Of the research I did about radiation therapy, as I'm not so sure I want to do it, there are 6 studies that fit my dx that all point to no significant increase in overall survival rate for someone with a mastectomy, so I figure having done chemo already, my odds are even better than mastectomy alone. One 20 year study even pointed out that among the deaths from breast cancer reported in women with mastectomy alone, 13.2%, proved less than the 21.2% due to causes from radiation side effects and not breast cancer. The study concluded, \"that with such modest results and no improvement in survival, the cost and toxicity of post mastectomy radiation does not justify its routine use.\" I'm armed with lots of questions for my oncologist. I don't want to just blindly follow what I'm told because that's just the protocol. D1- Keep that burka'd woman in your dreams, OK? Reading your shout out will clarify this for you. Jenn51- Sorry you lost your post. That is so frustrating. Hopefully, you'll return late and fill us in on how you are doing. Vettegal- Another gift from a client. You are so loved, girlfriend. That has got to make up for the boss's lack of compassion. Paula- I'm so glad you've been able to hang out with your kids after school, and that you will be able to attend their competition this weekend. Can't wait to hear all the news upon your return. Julie- So glad your ds was prepared, but just waitin' on mom to help him with the logistical part. That's got to make you proud!!!!! Hope you got some sleep after Idol last night. Carol- I have a website of my own, but I'm not allowed to post grades on it. I put up the weekly agenda and have handouts they need to download and print. Kids without access can do this at the library on Monday mornings or during SSR. It shocks me though how many kids won't log in and how many parents won't check it either. Hope your sleeve saga turns out and that your pizza and salad were tasting yummy (heck you next message stated it hit your stomach wrong...bummer), and that your trip to the chemotini lounge doesn't bring on a hangover. Tina-Hey stranger. Glad to hear from you. No, I don't go to pt, but think I may be experiencing le. I'll be talking to the oncologist on Monday about that. WhooHoo on the beer tasting good! Dana- Every week? Man, you won't have any recovery time. Taxol, only? Well, the Decadron will keep you going, I guess. Try taking the evening dose earlier in the day like 4pm, and then take a sleep aid. You've got to get some sleep!!!! If anyone can do this, it's you Little Warrior. I love that you're able to get up and move around. I'm stuck in a chair for three hours except to pee. CHJ- Hope Carol picked up that tab for you, and that you both had a good visit to the lounge. Here's hoping that you make it through this one with no hangover and no other illnesses. CarolCA-Wow,it is a good thing that your aqua aerobics class and Russian History class are on a night you're high on Decadron. I'm thinking a few days from now, doing 4 miles, a water class, and a night class wouldn't appeal much to you. D1- Hmmm, magazines and a woman in a burka? What associations do you make with magazines and then to women in burka's? My first thought is women in burka's are not allowed to question men or anyone in authority. They are often not educated, thus her interest in your magazines maybe? Are these dreams after frustrating encounters with people like your surgeon when you're trying to take charge of your own health care choices? Kathy- I am so glad you'll be able to make the memorial tonight. It's 2pm here, and I'm still in pjs if that makes you feel any better. Oh, Kindergarten isn't what it used to be...at least in CA. It's not snack time, playing to hone social skills, and being read to anymore. Kindergarten kids have homework! It is so wrong. Hey LJ13- Glad you've feeling perky!!!! OK, that was some catching up I had to do. Well, got to go shower and hit the lab before too long. SIS Kimberly",

WhooHoo!!!! Julie-Yeah that you\u2019ve only felt tired and had no vomiting or nausea as of Sunday. Let\u2019s keep going in that direction. D1- Hmmm, those nail issues don\u2019t sound fun,but good to know it will clear up now that you\u2019re done with chemo. Earring issues, too.  Geez.  Love the legu acronym as you\u2019re correct calling her your leg might be confusing. What was the final decision for your license plate? Hope the banquet wasn\u2019t too boring. Tinalee- Oh,your trip memories reminded me of my dh and I taking the trailer on a trip up to Oregon and Washington. We also did Whidby Is., Anecortes, and other little islands. It was so beautiful. We hit the St. Helena park on the way up and the Crater Lake on the way back. We stopped in Klamath and stayed. My folks met us up there. While in Washington we visited Tacoma and took a trip over to Victoria and Vancuver. My twin flew up and met us for this leg of the trip.  Thank you for triggering that memory. CarolCa- 100 countries in your lifetime is a great goal. Go for it!!! Way to put the \u2018shadow\u2019 into perspective and once again educating those of us not familiar with all of these tests. Thank you!!!! Jenn- Oh what a scary thing and to have to wait for results is such a nightmare.  I\u2019ll be sending positive thoughts your way darlin\u2019.  I haven\u2019t had a MUGA yet, but asked my onco. if I\u2019d get one when done to make sure my heart was still in good condition after the TAC regime, which isn\u2019t always nice to the heart. I do have expanders, so if I do have a \u2018shadow\u2019, will the expanders hide it or cause my onco. to not pay attention?  I also asked for a bone density test afterwards as TAC isn\u2019t always so nice on the bones either. He was on board with both of those. Oh, your doxie story was so sweet, and your lovin\u2019 reference to your mom as a grouchy old prude was priceless.  My mom\u2019s mom wasn\u2019t always the easiest to deal with especially toward the end of her life, and her side of the family even worse when it came time to deal with dispersing the estate after my step-grandfather, whom I loved dearly. He softened my grandmother quite a bit. It is what it is, so why not just call it what it is, right? Doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love her or that I didn\u2019t love my grandmother. Carol- Love the pic. Don\u2019t you love the homemade cards? My son did that one Christmas for everyone bc he was really poor. Everyone loved them. He made me cry with his to me, and my dh, his step-dad, was moved by his as well. Writing allows our men to say what they want and feel, but just can\u2019t verbalize, I think. And major points for the dh for getting you three more pair of earrings. Oh on the contrary, dear Carol, wearing a FUBC shirt is not against the positive thinking goal\u2026we want cancer to go away, so we are sending that message out to the universe. We are positive this thing must go!!!! And you took such good care of yourself with the bath and getting comfy\u2026all prepared for a new way of being for the rest of the evening. BRAVO!!!! About the analogy-they just come to me. Guess it\u2019s my line of work and having to analyze literature or something. I\u2019m doing the same thing as far as keeping track of things since the dx.  I think it\u2019s a great idea that you write it out in your own words even if it is only seen by you and your family. It\u2019s cathartic. Hope the pooper and period have resolved by tomorrow. My story: I moved and switched doctors. Met him in July 2007. He ordered all the usual yearly exams. My blood tests came back with really low hemoglobin. I\u2019ve had issues with anemia off and on since I started giving blood. I\u2019m A-, so my blood was in demand especially because I was negative for some virus thing. Anyway, I was used to being turned down a few times a year, but last year, it was more often than not. So, in July I took a test to make sure I wasn\u2019t bleeding from the colon. I wasn\u2019t.  I don\u2019t consider my periods heavy at all which was another concern, so I was put on iron 900mg a day. I re-did the test in August, a small change.  I did my mammo at the end of August. I do one annually due to family history- dad had breast cancer. Never a bad scan. School was already in session. I noticed that when the tech did the top to bottom squish, that it hurt like heck,which was never an issue previously. That night I felt a huge lump on top of my breast. There was no way I could have missed that as I do self exams all the time. My husband said he certainly would have noticed that. I got the call to come in for a redo. I mentioned the lump I felt, and asked if the pain I felt could have been caused by the squish. Didn\u2019t know. I was then taken in for an ultrasound. Yep, suspicious lump at 12:00. Back for a biopsy the next week. Cancer was diagnosed on 10/10/07. Met with oncologist, told him about the lump I felt. He said, the lump on the mammo is too deep to have felt it manually, so the lump on the surface was possibly an injury or something else. He ordered a PET scan and a breast MRI. The PET found two more tumors. One at 7:00 o\u2019clock and one in the axilary area. That\u2019s how breast cancer was found for me. Had my bilateral mastectomy on Dec. 6th, and I found the Jewels on December 14th. Oh, interesting note, my hemoglobin shot way up after the tumors were gone. Of course with chemo they\u2019re back in the low category, but I have no doubt they will pick back up again.  Makes me wonder if there was a link between my cancer growing and the issues with anemia. Don\u2019t know about future screening yet\u2026my onco is a one thing at a time guy. Paula- Glad you were able to get out and walk in your 50 degree heat wave. How wonderful are you feeding the masses pizza, but great idea knowing they\u2019d be wired. Food is a wonderful carrot to dangle once in awhile. OMG on that Respiratory Infection!!!  Time to have a dance with Jack eh? Joan- How awful to think, benign, than discover it isn\u2019t. Glad your doctor was vigilant even though the benign dx was given after the biopsy. I\u2019m glad to have the company under the blanket as we head into the fog this round, although as I stated this morning, with the nuclear reactive surges I\u2019ve been having the blanket may be too warm for me\u2026I\u2019ll be throwing my side off a lot. Hope you don't mind. Dana- So glad you\u2019re getting 4 of 7 days that are good!!!! Glad you had a good infusion day. Kris and I were right there with you. Kathy- So glad all went well at the Daddy Dance. Aren\u2019t kids great about just telling things like they are. I can imagine her saying something like, \u201cYes, my hair is gorgeous tonight isn\u2019t it? Mommy has no hair, it\u2019s a wig.\u201c LOL Can\u2019t wait to see the pics next week. CHJ- I concur about losing a pet during an emotionally trying time being so hard and how they really do sense that something is different. Animals are amazing.  Glad you\u2019re back at work and feeling good after only 5 days. That\u2019s awesome!!! Deb- Wow, what a journey. I don\u2019t blame you for just stating take them both, I don\u2019t want to be worrying.  Reconstruction can totally be done at a later time. How\u2019s the dp doing after the funeral? Wendy- So good to hear from you\u2026and yep, you got the Tx #3 blue jewel syndrome and was hit by the same Mac 18 wheeler all right!  Here is to an easier Tx#4\u2026I just had my number #4 today, so we\u2019ll have to compare notes. Taxol for 12 weeks\u2026no time to recoup\u2026hopefully the se\u2019s are much lighter that AC for you. Therese- I don\u2019t regret my choice to remove both breasts either considering there were atypical cells found in the right, so I\u2019m thinking it was ripe for starting. So, both you and Kathy were on the wanting breast augmentation/enhancement when you were dx, so getting your wish out of this not so pretty dx was totally deserved and paid for by your insurance company. Congrats by the way for taking charge of your weight and losing 40 pounds and training with a trainer. You\u2019ll be able to get back to that feeling good and in the best shape of your life soon. Well, your tx #4 story is not making me feel so good about my hopes of skipping the cumulative action between #3 and #4\u2026I was so out of it after #3, I can\u2019t imagine being even more out of it.  Uuggghhh.  I\u2019m Ok on the nails, still losing eyelashes and eyebrows. Had only a pimple or sore like thing in crease of ear where you would use a q-tip in the crease just above the ear\u2019s opening\u2026does that make sense? Left ear. Pale and just look \u2018older\u2019 IMO\u2026it\u2019s clear chemo is taking it\u2019s toll as Kathy, I believe, mentioned earlier. Ok, all caught up. Good luck to Carol, Joan, Judy, and Wendy tomorrow. SIS Kimberly",

A spoonful of oatmeal if too full can be problematic.  GEEEZZZZ!!!!!  This last tx kicked my butt and good.  Today, I finally have the energy to do a few errands ( I have been in this house, although I've been out to the backyard to sit in the fresh air, for 9 days).... and oh... I know.... people will take a double take, ...\"Is that who I think it is...is that Angelina Jolie?\"  HaHaHa  The dh calls my bottom lip my Angelina Jolie lip. Vettegal- LOL on hiring a hit man to take out Aunt Flo. I had visions of the scene with all the munchkins in OZ singing The Wicked Witch Is Dead, but it was all of us singing, \u201cWhooHoo Aunt Flo is gone.\u201d     OK, for some,but not others.  I have not had a period since February, and I should have started this week, but I\u2019m not holding my breath \u2018cause we all know Aunt Flo can be cantankerous. Glad you were able to get some real sleep the other night. Rejuvinating. I love tulips\u2026and your dh\u2019s senitimentality....(sigh). CHJ- You\u2019re welcome.  I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling shinier\u2026and how can one help it with daffodils coming up? Jenn- Hoping you\u2019re doing well after your tx. Your youngest son, Clay, reminds me of my Jon.  He\u2019s always calling to check in on me and to tell me he loves too.  He has experienced a lot of death in his life (my mom, his great grandparents, his uncle, his beloved cat, and a good friend of his) so I can\u2019t imagine that the thought of losing me hasn\u2019t crossed his mind. He tells me that he shares my story with his classmates when they are complaining about stuff, and then he tells me how impressed they are with my positive outlook.  Telling my story seems to help him cope. Hope those baskets got put together \u2018just so\u2019. Carol- I\u2019ll be thinking of you in sunny Arizona playing golf, laughing with friends, drinking a little something fun, and meeting your CMF gal.  Have a great time\u2026you deserve it!!!!! About the Wendi book. I got it, but I can\u2019t read it right now.  I\u2019m really burnt out on bc stuff. As a matter of fact, I had to take all the books off the table that were staring at me waiting for me to read them\u2026pick me pick me\u2026just kidding, they weren\u2019t talking to me, but it just felt overwhelming to have all those books piled there.  So now I have a few and it feel better.  I read one yesterday about best friends who met in college in the 70\u2019s. It was pretty good. Glad the ole noggin wasn\u2019t too badly injured.  I\u2019m sure the \u2018nut\u2019 will be gone before your trip. I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019ll have my doc do the estrogen level test every three or four months once I\u2019m done with chemo to see if my levels are going down on their own.  If they go down to a level docs are happy with, I may not feel the urgency to remove the ovaries.  If they don\u2019t, then I\u2019ll do that for sure.  I don\u2019t want to do any unneeded surgeries if I don\u2019t have to put myself through it. LWDana- Wow, when you\u2019re feeling strongly about something, you feel strongly about it\u2026felt like what I imagine those \u201cHail, Fire, and Brimstone\u201d revivals to be like.  I\u2019m glad that your faith gives you comfort and strength, but respectfully disagree with the statement \u2018Dr\u2019s don\u2019t know s#&t\u2019.   Certainly, they don\u2019t know everything, as that would be impossible, but they do the best they can for their patients\u2026at least most do in my opinion. If you\u2019re not happy with your doctor, you do have the right to change doctors, but it\u2019s not him that you don\u2019t like, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not telling you what you want to hear or believe (in his view, he\u2019s being realistic and trying to give you the reality of the uphill battle you face, which doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll not make it to the top, just that it will be hard).  I\u2019m not saying you have to blindly follow everything your doctor says, you know me, I\u2019m all about being well informed, but I don\u2019t think a general statement like \u2018Doctors don\u2019t know s$&t\u2019 is accurate. Your views expressed to Jenn about doctors and nurses only being certified by the board and not by God were a little surprising considering the fact you want to be a nurse so badly. It sounds like you\u2019re letting go of a lot of anger right now, LWDana, so take a deep breath and be aware. Whew, one minute really on the rant and the next buying donuts and happy her hair is falling out.  Yep, she\u2019s on the emotional roller coaster.  Hang on Dana!!!!! Hope your classmates enjoyed their donuts and hope your birthday was filled joy. Paula- You are one dedicated lady, Paula.  I admire that you give your kids so much of your time, and that they appreciate it.  Julie- Love that graphic.  How do you find that stuff?  CarolC- Here\u2019s to a light fog on your last tx!!!! You\u2019re done!!!! WhooHoo!!!! Kathy- Thanks for your kind words. It gives me pleasure to know that my words can be uplifiting. I will be putting one foot in front of the other today for sure. I\u2019ve got to get a few errands run for the adult kids Easter Egg hunt.  Glad you\u2019re not too down yet\u2026good thing you\u2019ve got all those errands done last week for Easter and sounds like the flower bed, too.  Glad you\u2019re Mom will be there to help you out this weekend.   You\u2019re done with chemo!!!! WhooHoo!!!  And that recipe sounds like it needs to be posted. Speaking of WhooHoo, has anyone noticed that I must have inspired Washington Mutual with my WhooHoo?  They did, it is in their newest commercial. Joan- Hey blue jewel, nothing wrong with being down at the thought of one more chemo and then radiation. It seems like such a long dark tunnel with a pinpoint of light at the end, but if you think about it\u2026three months has already passed since January. Can you believe it? (((HUGS))) Hey Deb- Sorry to hear that you\u2019re having neuropathy issues with your feet. That is one that I haven\u2019t had the pleasure to meet, and hopefully don\u2019t run into over the course of my last two txs.  Glad you\u2019ll have some relief soon with the meds.  A new season for the Jewels\u2026nice! LJ13- Good luck at the lounge today.  ½ way there!!!!! Maz- I\u2019m so glad all went well with your tx and that you had a chance to talk to your bff.  Wow, you sound great today, and I love your resolve to help her through treatment since you\u2019re the \u2018veteran\u2019 and to learn how to face the end with courage and dignity from her\u2026what a gift for you both! Tinalee- You cracked me up\u2026.I feel a droolfest (nap) coming on. Hope the tx infusion goes well and that you have an se-light weekend. CathyCa- Oh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear of the loss of your cooking instructor.  What a life she made for herself. What a testament to survival she was!!!! SheShe- Glad you were able to get outside for a walk\u2026and I know waiting for test results sucks.  Try to put it out of your mind and concentrate on the fact that it\u2019s spring!!!! WhooHoo!!! You\u2019ve got a wedding coming up soon. OK, I\u2019m all caught up. Enjoy your Friday everyone. Love to all, SIS Kimberly",

There is a Create Your Own type tab that takes you to where you can create you own t-shirts...yeah, it will take some looking around to see how it works exactly....not easy to do while at work. Welcome Licorice- Yes and Yes, both are possible- answers to your questions. You've come to the right place...we are a FABULOUS,,,if I should say so myself...group of women to be hanging with while on this journey. LJ13-I'm so sorry you got \"crappy' news...ARDeb, CathyCa, and our fearless D1/OLE have all given you some great facts about the possible triple neg. thing. I hope that helped a little to ease your mind. Glad your port wasn't as bad as you anticipated. Vettagal-I can so picture it now...\"Watch out...she's coming in for a crash landing!!!\" the boss yells as customers and plumbers run to take cover behind displays. :-) I've hear that either heat or ice can help...but that extreme heat and cold can trigger lymphodema symptoms...have you taken Advil or something like that for the inflammation and pain? KathyL-Can't wait to hear about your class. I handles the Decadron well. It did make me feel like I had too much caffeine for awhile, but not too bad...just didn't add to it by having coffee. I took it after I ate breakfast and dinner as suggested by my pharmacist. I took a valium with it after dinner to help me sleep as I 'd heard it can keep you up. I slept fine. D1/OLE - Thank you for your cheery Go For It...We're Here With Ya...shout out for Deb and myself. I'm sure you read my response to KathyL regarding Decadron, so I won't repeat myself. I totally understand your anxiety about your appt. today. You've been with this doctor for 30 years...he's not just a doctor, but a friend...he called you to check on you several times for goodness sake. It's like showing your little Frankenboob to the male half of really good couple friends...which I am not seeing you doing...\"Hey, want to see my Frankenboob, George, I'm sure Shirley won't mind\" :-0 LOL If I know you, you'll both be cracking up during your exam and the people in the hall are going to be wondering what the heck is going on in there. Off topic....sort of....my mom- she passed of Pancreatic Cancer almost 15 years ago\u2026 has been on my mind a lot since I was diagnosed...I keep thinking of how she just did what she had to do...kept up the positive attitude for as long as she could. I miss her!!!! My poetry-she was quite a writer- is in part a piece of her...her legacy continuing. As I anticipated my first chemotini yesterday, this poem formed\u2026and I dedicate it to all of us on this journey. 1/7/08 Club Survivor I imagine my cancer cells impeccably dressed in don\u2019t care how much it costs dramatic designer black. I picture them, analogous to the rich hip twenty-somethings, the ones who have no sense of responsibility, only feelings of entitlement; the won\u2019t happen to me indestructible crowd, all gathering at the newest club in town\u2026 Club Survival. It is one of those red-velvet-roped- can\u2019t-get-in- unless- you\u2019re-one-of-them- kind of places. Club Survival is where everyone, who thinks they are anyone, is drinking copious amounts of the newest martini craze, introduced by me, the club\u2019s owner and bartender. This can\u2019t get enough of it drink- The Black Cat Chemotini. And not wanting to be on the outside of the in-crowd, they all drink up. The Black Cat Chemotini, so named for the superstitious belief it is bad luck for a black cat to cross your path, strongly appeals to this fate tempting defiant crowd. The Black Cat has a splash of Decadron, which has a stimulant affect and keeps the in-crowd wired, like those energy drinks they are addicted to, allowing them to stay up all night drinking more than they might otherwise as they mingle superficially with one another. To that splash is added equal parts of a few secret ingredients, hard to pronounce, so I just call it adding the CAT, and viola! The fact that they go home, and don\u2019t feel the effects at first is the beauty of it. It lulls them into a false sense of security convinces them they really are in charge. But,by the time they realize what\u2019s really happening, it is too late\u2026 they are completely addicted to the lure of the Black Cat. These impetuous youth sell their souls to get their next fix, which I gladly serve shaken, not stirred, with a twist of lemon and a smile before sending them on their way\u2026 Ta, Ta, dahlings. Kiss. Kiss I've got my Super Girl cape...my martini glass...and my sisters...so I'm ready to head on over to Club Survival...in just over 2 hours, I'll be bartending and serving those cocky little cancer cells a Black Cat Martini.

I agree...my body knows what it needs and just does tells me...sleep...don't eat that...you want to eat this....and drink some more water while you're at it! I did 3 loads of laundry yesterday and emptied the dishwasher, and made my own breakfast and lunch yesterday. I also got in a VitD walk. Today, Greg made me pancakes and eggs for breakfast and leftover soup for lunch. I know I am so lucky to have this man of mine. Anyway, we went out for a bit, and I thought I really want to try a small decaf gingerbread latte...something with more consistency than water... and of course, you can't have a coffee without a little treat. I was just so thrilled that I actually wanted to eat today...of course nothing has much taste...sigh :-( I so wanted to taste my piece of Pumpkin Loaf and decaf from Starbucks! Not happening... Oh well...I guess this will keep me from eating foods that aren't good for me....why bother if you can't taste them? Vettagal and Julie- I am so sorry that you are so sick!!!! And here I'm whining about a little nausea, constipation, and gaseous bloat that made me feel like I'd explode...take care of yourselves...especially you Julie...you need to call as CathyCa said...you have to keep from getting dehydrated. D1/OLE- Can't wait to hear how the wig shopping went...you crack me up as billsgirl stated...thank you for your humor. And I'm all for evicting SE's...let's pass those notices all around shall we? Billsgirl-I am so glad you've had a 'good' experience so far with round #1...well except for the insurance thing. My SEs didn't really kick in until day 3 and 4...but that doesn't mean you'll experience it the same way or in the same time frame. WhooHoo on the BRCA test. Still waiting for my Dad's and sister's results. Dana-You sweet thing, you. Your words are plenty! I'm so glad you had a good day at work...being a positive influence is magical isn't it? I agree with you on not having time for this...but look at you just workin' it, girl! As for the food thing...let your friends cook...there are lots of recipes online they could try out for you. Eat what your stomach can tolerate. Jan. 22 is only 9 days away...and if they cancel your appt. again...I will personally put on my teacher voice and send your onc to the principal's office for disrespectful behavior. Theresa- so looks like Deb and I have only a little more time before the hair takes it's last curtain call for this show, eh? Are you ready, Deb? I'm not...I am going to look at hats and things on Thursday with my twin. I have an expander fill-up, so that seems like a good time to do it. I will call them first D1/OLEand make sure I don't need an appt. SIS Kimberly",

I think it's a good idea to heal completely from this bronchitis/pneumonia bout. And diarreah... yet another SE to contend with...Good news you've got a plan now. 4 treatments is very doable... D1/OLE- OK, so I didn't get to everything I wanted to...but I did get everything but the sweeping and vaccuming done....hmmmm, I wonder if that was subconscious. :-) Kathy L- You asked for it...you got it.... You asked for a poem about SE\u2019s\u2026and I\u2019m thinking this qualifies as Free Verse\u2026Enjoy. The Side Effects Circus 1/15/08 Ok, you\u2019ve all been there. You know what I mean that morbid curiosity, that little part of you that wants to see the freak show even though you know it isn\u2019t polite to look\u2026let alone stare? Well, have you been to the Side Effects Circus lately? Ladies and Gentleman, people of all ages, welcome to the only show on Earth that will gladly exploit misery and encourage you to watch\u2026applaud even. But more importantly\u2026to laugh! In this ring, with her posse of Pugs, our very own juggler, Mucus Maiden. She\u2019s a veritable contradiction. Her nose runs and yet is so dry it bleeds. Her eyes water, and yet she needs eye drops to keep them moist. Her mouth and throat are filled with sores and\u2026well\u2026there is no opposite of that. Notice her tool belt, and how deftly she manages everything she needs with flawless effort? Let\u2019s ooohh and aaahhh everyone. She\u2019s sponsored by Kleenex, the makers of saline nose spray and eye drops, Blistex, and Biotene. Overhead, on the flying trapeze, Our Dame of Digestive Distress. Look at her pale complexion and how it morphs into a lovely shade of green when she\u2019s nauseous. If you haven\u2019t put on your rain poncho, you may want to do that now. You never know when she\u2019s going to blow. Be glad she\u2019s overhead, she\u2019s so bloated from constipation and the build up of gas, she\u2019s being studied as an alternative energy source. Give her a round of applause. She\u2019s sponsored by Colace, Gas Ex, Preparation H, the makers of Compazine, and Pepcid AC. Performing with the clowns, our Ambassador of Annoying. Her skin itches and has become so dry, she looks to be aging before our very eyes. Her nails are brittle and discolored, and her taste buds have left her in a state of blah. But there is good news\u2026 there is a rumor that she will be the spokesperson (make up and soft focus lighting can do wonders) for what advertisers are calling the next diet craze\u2026 The Chemo Diet. Isn\u2019t she a site to behold? She\u2019s sponsored by Gold Bond lotion, Bare Minerals, and the manicurist\u2019s and pedicurist\u2019s union #356. And now\u2026 The one you\u2019ve all been waiting for\u2026 Our main attraction in the center ring riding the elephant, our very own Heiress of Hair Loss. Notice her bald head\u2026isn\u2019t it great? There isn\u2019t a hair on her head, or anywhere else for that matter. Smooth as a baby\u2019s butt. She\u2019s been known to drop handfuls of hair, like Hansel and Gretal dropping bread crumbs. What is most amazing about her is the fact that she\u2019s a master of disguise\u2026 we never know who will appear from her dressing room after the show. And can she tie a scarf\u2026 like a Navy Seaman can tie knots! Give it up for our Bald Beauty everyone. She\u2019s sponsored by the makers of DustBuster and Draino, the Wig Makers Association, and Scarves Are Us. Thank you all so much for coming in today to see the amazing Side Effects Circus. Please stop by our gift shop on the way out to sample all of our sponsors\u2019 products and to get a closer look and maybe an autograph from all of our amazing circus performers. SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Jan 17, 2008 07:59AM - edited Jan 17, 2008 08:01AM by SISKimberly Good morning Jewels, Again, for all of your wonderful comments about The Side Effects Circus...geez, my soon to be bald head might just be swelling. ;-) WVgirl-Man, to make that choice...I can't even imagine. What can you say to someone whose stopped treatment and has decided to let his disease take him? I'm with ya on the hair change thing...getting course or something...and my scalp itches at times...I know it's coming. Sista2-my chemo room is pretty 'cozy'- code for small. Not everyone has a recliner although all chairs are comfortable - at least the patient ones are. My treatment is done right in my oncologist's office. The staff is pretty darn cheery and then of course when Supergirl shows up with her chemotini glass everyone else perks right up, too. My port sticks out a bit, too. Mine has been in since 12/6, so give it time. The swelling will go down, and it will become just another part of you. CarolC- I cannot believe you were emailing and stuff while at treatment...cool! Like real time play by play coverage. I did see GMA and was so thrilled for her. I don't really know much about her cancer...the stage or extent of what she had done...but dang she looked great with no hair. Carol- I will bet your doctor so appreciated your thanks and really meant that hug. Good for you for thanking her...so many people in the service industry don't get the thanks they deserve...and doctors, nurses, teachers, librarians, etc...all serve our communities. PALady- Sorry you had a rough day- there are positives to losing your hair. No shampooing, no blow drying and styling, no shaving, no expensive salon bills for cuts and color, you can put on a wig of any color and style and 'play' with new looks, you can wear beautiful scarves and be exotic... It is all a matter of how you look at it...but most important....it's all temporary. Hang in there sweetie. Paula- I so love that you're teaching kids a career path. We so need more programs like that for kids who just aren't going to do the traditional college route right out of high school. As a teacher...I applaud you! And WOW, what great coworkers you have. I do as well. I'm pretty lucky. Jenn51 - Thanks, I just have to find my new normal. I admire those already working out at the gym...I'll have to ask my ps today if I can get some PT...my left arm isn't recovering as well as my right...and I want to do more than just walk. I hear you on the caffeine...although I'm not a soda person...if it tastes good to you after chemo drink it. I'm thinking it won't be so good on the tummy by day 3...but after day 5 or so it might be good again. You'll just have to experiment. LJ13- WHooHoo on the positive result. CarolC-Kathy-and Maz- Congrats. One down! Jenn51 and Carol...(did I miss anyone?) Good luck today! Julie- So glad you're up and about...don't you mind those men of yours...if you like your wig and how it makes you look, then that's all that matters. OK, off to the plastic surgeon for a fill up. One more after this one, and I'm done expanding....breasts....not my mind or my horizons. :-) D1/OLE- So, how did it go? SISKimberly",

Glad you seem to be doing well all things considered. I agree that all the Mom's deserve a huge round of applause...especially those with little ones. Jenn 51- Sorry to hear you're still out of it, but glad the shakes weren't due to a fever. Hang in there. I'm almost 8 weeks out from my bilat. and I'm still experiencing discomfort. I can't sleep on my left side at all, I feel tightening under my arms, my chest feels like someone is sitting on it at times-results of expansion-, and I don't have my range of motion back yet. Give your body time to heal...it's been through a lot. LJ13- Wow, doing your tx every two weeks certainly doesn't give your body a chance to recover. I'm every three weeks with all three of my chemo drugs, so hopefully that third week will give my body more time to recoup. Paula-Sorry you didn't sleep well, but thankfully you had the day to rest. It must be difficult having to drive even when you feel like c@#p. Does your community had Dial A Ride? You call in advance, and they pick you up, take you to your appt. , and pick you up at whatever time you determine? I've heard the American Cancer Society can help with transportation issues. Just a thought. I can understand how your dh could feel helpless at times not being able to assist you and knowing how much you do. ((((HUGS)))) for you both. Kathy-How could I have ever doubted that you'ld post our calendar, through the fog as D1 would say? You are amazing. And what a wonderful story you shared about your daughter. I can't even imagine having to deal with my lack of energy and the abundance of energy kids bring into a house...I'm glad you have wonderful mom friends who are willing and able to give you a break...and let's not forgot the GREATEST DAD!!!! My hat, although I don't wear one- I look like a total doofus in a hat-, is off to you! Vettegal- Nice picture. Glad to hear your arm is slowly getting better. Are you able to use your headset without too much discomfort yet? I know you're anxious about your first infusion, but once it's over, you'll think....that wasn't so bad...until the SE's hit...but after what you've gone through already...you might think it's a cake walk. :-) D1/OLE- Speaking of cake....chocolate cake? Wow, that's an interesting thing to crave. I ate lots of eggs, too. It was all I could really taste. My taste buds are being choosy about what they taste and what they don't. It's an adventure. Leave it you to find the silver lining while experiencing the se's of tx2, \"at least my hair won't fall out!!!!\" LOL I am so glad that your college girl was able to be home with you over the holiday. I know you'll miss her. And how sweet to do the laundry and housework, and try to cook for you. I hope your PT therapist can help you learn to stretch and relax your back muscles,so you don't have to do spasms anymore. Glad the heating pad is helping relieve that tension. AZDonna- What a bummer about the tooth...but better it happened now and not in the middle of chemo week. Hope your root canal goes well...yeah, like making a crater in your mouth and digging around in there to relieve an absess is something to look forward to eh? Thank goodness for pain meds. Take care of yourself. (((HUGS)))) DianaB-You have been through so much...I do not blame you for being skeptical about this next round of a new treatment. Will the blood thinners only be for the duration of the treatment? Here's to an easier road ahead. Deb-Glad you're feeling normal enough to go play. Good for you. I hadn't heard of the Lydia Project...that's nice to have a chemoangel. When I left the hospital after my bilat,the head nurse from the Breast Cancer Center gave me a canvas bag with all kinds of helpful goodies to help me with recovery. It was put together by a group called \"The Essentials Bag\". I made a donation with my Thank You card when I got home, so they could put more bags together for other bc patients. Has anyone heard from Dana? CathyC- Good for you!!! Way to get on top of it! PALady, that's the same schedule I'm on for my steroids. To all of you SHEROES...those of you dealing with horrible reactions to tx, getting the flu or some other lovely illness on top of everything else, fighting insurance companies, feeling the pressures of work or the stresses of not being able to work, caring for dh's or elderly parents who have their own medical needs or challenges, raising young children, finding another lump, or going to school and working full time...you are my SHEROES ladies!!!!

      "Content": "Jan 22, 2008 08:16AM - edited Jan 22, 2008 08:27AM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels- D1/OLE- I hope PT went well. I told my 24 year old, who called as he was casting his absentee ballot for Mom's opinion on a Prop. or two, that my hair was having a caucus right now deciding which delegates would leap off my head first- the greys or the dark ash blond? He cracked up. I haven't lost my hair in clumps yet...it feels thinner, so I'm thinking it's sneaking off my head when I'm not looking. ;-). Carol- Nice picture!! I'm with you on the ovary removal thing. Whatever it takes to knock out the estrogen. My onc. nurse told me I would go into a permanent chemopause with my treatment and that I would lose all my hair. Guess she's been doing this long enough to know...and I'm totally OK with not having a period again. I'm glad you liked the SHEROES term. I like it too because in cases like the ones I mentioned in my earlier post, it fits. That's why I wear my SuperGirl cape...all SHEROES need one...that and a chemotini glass. ;-) I tried the Miralax last night and it worked pretty darn well. No discomfort at all. I did the Sahara Desert thing...Biotene worked for me a little, but just a few days ago I noticed I'm not feeling like that anymore...still swishing am and pm, but it's gone now...could be the consistant use of Biotene, or that the se has gone away...who knows. Some foods still taste funny, but I can drink a cup of coffee now...whoohoo. PALady- Clumps of hair coming out certainly would send me to get the balditude shave, but like I just told Carol...hasn't happened yet. Hmmm, maybe it's coming. Sista- Well, at least you've got a plan now. Good luck on Thursday. The pre-chemo jitters are much worse than the actual event- that not knowing thing. Once you've got one round down, you'll have a good compass reading and know your direction so to speak. Hang in there- we're here for you. WVgirl- Oh man, a migrain on top of chemobrain. I'm so sorry to hear that you had to go through that. Good luck with round #2. CathyCa- 6 hours! Wow. Glad you're doing well. Your trip to Utah sounds like a good chance to spend time with your son- who of course will be your own personal sherpa carrying the luggage in gratitude for taking him snowboarding. Hopefully, the se's won't keep you in the hotel room the whole time and that you have a chance to visit with your friends. Does your hotel have roomservice? That will be a big help if you can't get yourself out to a meal. Maz- Good to see your post, but you didn't tell us how you are. How are you doing? Vettegal- KathyL - I'm appointing her our official researcher/librarian, since she's got so much knowledge to share with us about drugs, dosages, se's etc... (You ROCK Kathy) - gave you tons of great information. I'd like to add that I was given Valium for muscle spasm contol if I needed it after my bilat surgery. I took one every night and it knocked me out even though I took my Decodron 12 hours apart like most everyone on this thread seems to be doing. I also had a decodron boost through my port before my chemo started. If you're prepared for the possible se's, you can prevent or at least keep at bay the ones that fancy your company. I'd suggest taking the Miralax the day before and follow up each day with that as the anti-nausea meds can cause constipation, I hear. That may keep you from going through birthing a cinder block as many of us experienced before knowing better. You'll be fine...just take a deep breath and know that you can do this thing!!!! SheShe- Oh, you didn't cause me to lose my post. I had to delete because I was a dork and missed a whole page of the JJ's posts for some reason. I had to read those first and then start again. It was so not your fault...I just added at the bottom that you must have posted at the same time because I didn't want you to feel I hadn't read your post. CarolC- Glad to hear you made progress with the mortgage company and all. Also pleased to hear that you've got a good back up plan, and that your doctor feels confident that Cytoxen is the better choice anyway. The American Cancer Society has wigs for free or low cost...did you check them out? Well, gals. Have a great day. SIS Kimberly",

D1- Glad today is better...and will just keep getting better. Let us know how PT goes. I get my wig fitted and cut today... Welcome CHJ and Judy- You have joined a great group of gals here. The Jewels are funny, inspiring, and supportive... CHJ- It's never too late to join the group...OK, I guess if a person starts chemo in Feb. they technically wouldn't be a Jan. Jewel, but you're definately a Jewel. Welcome Judy, I can't even imagine how frustrating that must be being in a small town where if the only specialist is out of town things stop. No one here has mets, but the treatment is the same, so we're here for you. There is also a thread dedicated to people with mets if you want to join a second group. Dana, so glad you checked in. I can't even imagine working and going to school full-time while doing chemo, but if anyone can pull that off, it's you. You've got spunk, girl. I'd ask for a Wed. infusion like D1 so you have the weekend to recoup. Kathy-OMG, we LOVE your advice and the fact you're sharing your knowledge. Both you and LJ13 are awesome at giving us info on drugs, effects, remedies, and facts...keep it comin' baby!!!! Maz- Your absence is understandable with so much going on in your life. You're one of the SHEROES I mentioned earlier. I'm glad the se's aren't too bad. That's got to be a positive when you're taking care of your mom, too. Nothing wrong with just reading and speaking up only when you've got something to say. Take care, sweetie. Hey Paula-glad you were able to work today and that it went well. I am so sorry about your husband having a bad night. I can't even imagine how you do everything...teaching, grading papers, taking care of the house, your own treatment and your husband's...a SHERO...that's what you are!!!! OK, gotta go get ready for a walk with my neighbor...I'll catch up with the rest of the posts when I get back. I left off on Paula...yes, I take notes. ;-) SIS KImberly",

Glad you enjoyed my writing and the writing of others who have posted. I'm still mulling over a poem about baldacious babes...I've been working on a short story for an anthology of a writer friends of my stepmothers called HotFlashes and also just taking advantage of my feeling good week. DianaB- Loved your response to the 'cow'....way to go! Like Kathy said, the things that come out of people's mouths! I also agree that you can't just let this sit. If creditors know what's going on and you're able to work out a payment plan you can realistically afford at this juncture...that shows you aren't just trying to blow off your obligations...they'll work with you. With all the suggestions from CathyCA and KathyL, you've got many options and avenues for resolving this issue. I know it's exhausting...can your dh help with phone calls? Deep breath...we're here and sending out lots of positive energy to the universe to get this resolved for you, Cathy, and Dana. Kathy-I am so glad you're home and feeling better. Your dh sounds like a prince. Now to the mounds of paperwork eh? At least you can sit while you take care of that. CHJ- I didn't experience that...I too hope you're not coming down with something. Take care of yourself and do stay away from others if you're feeling sick...work from home again if that's an option. Take care of you. So today, I'm meeting a teacher friend at school...she's preparing for a sub today so she can spend time with her DD this afternoon (DD is up for snowboarding and takes the train home to SF where she's working on a combination teaching credential/Phd in Philosophy), so my friend is taking the day to spend the am with me and the pm with her). Then we're off for my last fill up. WhooHoo! Afterwards, I'm meeting another friend for lunch. Should be a fun day. Happy Birthday Jenn. Enjoy your day!!!! TaTa For Now Jewels, SIS Kimberly",

Why were you having a pelvic scan? Are you having other symptoms? wvgirl- Glad you liked the poem, but sorry to hear your DH is so CLUELESS. Like Paula and Kathy stated, he wants to be supportive deep down, but just really doesn't know how. It's like you have to teach him what you need and how to talk to you by example. I agree that he may not know how to share is fear and helpless feelings with you. Many men don't know how, feel comfortable even awknowledging fear, and/or have been taught showing feelings isn't OK for a man. I agree you have to find support elsewhere if not at home, but I would hope that your husband would consider going to counseling with you. I think the American Cancer Society offers support groups and your hospital treatment center should have counseling options as well. Good luck sweetie. ((((HUGS)))) I like the blind horse poem. Carol- We must have been posting at the same time. I had a good day yesterday and wrote my baldacious babe poem. I can't wait to get my JJ's t-shirt. I am so wearing to my next tx with my SuperGirl cape. Paula- Wow, sounds like you had an energy filled day yesterday! WhooHoo! And your 'confession' was so eye opening. Of course you're not 100% up and positive and supportive after your dh's diagnosis and recovery. It's got to be so tough to deal with the loss of the man you married...changed moods and behavior and ability to communicate etc... Grieving that loss takes time...and the constant reminder of your loss and your kid's loss of their Dad is just unimaginable to me. I'm so sorry your family is having to go through this...but, the universe has its reasons for entrusting this experience to your family, and I have no doubt that there are times of joy mixed in with the hard work and frustrations. Don't beat yourself up for having DW syndrome...we've all been through that. You gave wvgirl some good insight. Diana63- Glad you liked the poem. The story I spoke of...is in the works...that's where my time is being spent right now, but the poem has been in the back of my mind, so I got it out yesterday in about 30 minutes and wanted to share it with you all. How are you feeling? Dealing with an autistic child has got to be frustrating as well. Is he highly functioning like Asbuergers(sp)? Is he getting treatment? How old is he? My son's girlfriend works with Austistic kids in their homes before they get to school. It's a great program. I've had at least four different levels of autistic kids in my classroom over the years...challenging to say to the least with no aide and 30 other kids, but we managed with a lot of behavior modification and rewards. CHJ- Good for you listening to your body. You are so lucky to have a boss that allows you to work from home. Vettegal, Dana, Jenn51 and all the other Jewels - thinking of you. Joan, Judy, Sunshine, and Deb3 (haven't heard from you in awhile) - good luck with tx #1 today. Go kick some cancer booty! With all the info and advice on this thread, you should be well prepared.

My stubble is falling out of my head daily. Leg hair not growing, but I still have some. I shaved underarms this past weekend, and hair isn't making a huge comeback as of today. My pubic hair is getting thinner for sure. I did start my prese drugs the day before treatment and plan to keep it up throughout. Awesome on the balditude recognition story.

I'm glad I did as the path report showed atypical cells...precancerous in the other breast. I'm thinking it was only a matter of time, so I was so glad I made the decision I did. It's a very personal choice and one you need to discuss with your oncologist and surgeon. SIS Kimberly",

I tell you what\u2026I remember the feeling I had when I finally made the choice to make a change\u2026like a huge weight lifted off my shoulders. I\u2019m so glad you had such a wonderful day and have found your calling in life. And taking care of you and loving you right now is totally the way to go. I feel like your mom\u2026all proud right now!!!!! Great advice for wvgirl\u2026there\u2019s a reason you\u2019re both on this thread\u2026lots of support for you here. Kathy- Like you, I haven\u2019t much trouble sleeping with the steroids either, but I do wake several times a night to pee, but go right back to sleep. I did have that one bone pain night, but now I take Ibuprofin before bed, which does the trick. Vettegal and Julie- I\u2019ve had a few minor headaches, but nothing major. Migrains\u2026that sucks. BTW Julie- I didn\u2019t go lift weights or anything like D1 does, just a twenty minute walk\u2026and you\u2019ve had a pretty rough go when compared to me, so I totally wouldn\u2019t be thinking of exercising if I were in your shoes. You just do what you can do. My new thing- my nose has been dry, but now my nose and eyes have been \u2018running\u2019 off and on. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to when they decide to make me look like either I\u2019ve got a cold, or like I\u2019m crying\u2026a big ole tear just streaks down my cheek. Oh so attractive. And\u2026is anyone else losing eyelashes? I\u2019m going to have to find out what to do when I can no longer wear mascara. I hear fake lashes are not a good idea due to the adhesive possible causing skin issues-irritation or microscopic tears in the skin. OK, I know we can talk about anything here, so here it goes\u2026 a pooper question\u2026has anyone else noticed that their anus is just sore? It isn\u2019t like hemroids from straining \u2018cause I solved that problem\u2026it just feels tender\u2026and all I can think of is that these chemicals we\u2019ve been eliminating are not making my anus happy at all. I love the idea of getting together when we\u2019re all done with this ride!!!! If we do it early in June \u201909, I\u2019ll be able to attend, otherwise, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll be doing my implant exchange that summer so I don\u2019t have to miss more school. Looks like we made it through another week. We had a lot of gals belly up to the bar\u2026here\u2019s to a relatively se free weekend ladies. SIS Kimberly",

We're seeing A Streetcare Named Desire...should be fun. I used to be into theater and dance in college, so I love this theater and dance and stuff. D1- Yes the GasX comes in pill form. I take two in the am and two in the pm with my Pepcid AC. Hope that works for you...I'd be concerned as well about the strips. Hope you got lots of rest today,so that you're up for tomorrow's big game. Therese- Glad to hear from you. Man, it sounds like you've got yourself a mess of se's going. How great you only have one more TC to go!!!! Then what? Dana- I'm glad that for now you've found peace in just letting it go. You've done what you can, and the oncologist has ordered your MRI, so it's the waiting game again. Frustrating for sure, but better to know what you're dealing with or not dealing with in order to get the right treatment plan. Sounds like this new onc is a keeper. ARDeb- I'm sorry you're having a rough go with the bone pain/spasms. I hope resting helps. (((HUGS))) wvgirl- That is so not right for customers to be yelling you. It isn't your fault his darned water pipe broke!!!! Isn't that always the way it is...you think of the best lines after the fact. I hope he felt really badly for making you cry.

I agree that resting more is the ticket\u2026and since it is your b-day, you can do anything you want. Again, so glad I could give you a big ole belly laugh\u2026and that you other gals have enjoyed SuperGirl\u2019s first photo shoot. Good luck CathyCa and CHJ today. Wear your FUBC shirts proudly!!! Carol- Glad to hear your Sunday ended on a somewhat lighter note\u2026a celebration of life. We did that for my mom\u2026no funeral\u2026and it really was a celebration with lots of tears and laughter. Hope you got a good night\u2019s sleep\u20265am is pretty early. Diana63- Hey, I remember using a Phisoderm as a kid. I should get some of that when I\u2019m at the store today. CarolC- You sound good\u2026I hope you don\u2019t have se\u2019s worse than you\u2019ve experienced. That would be awesome\u2026and keep you in a position to keep working. Stay away from sickies and stay warm. CathyCa- I\u2019ll be talking to my oncologist Thursday about the massaging to break down scar tissue and Mederma for the scars themselves prior to radiation. Thanks for the tip. Kathy- I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re feeling good this morning. And it is warm here, but that pic of me flying is over the high desert area of Pizona where I did a wild mustang count with the University of Davis a couple years ago. It was an awesome trip\u2026riding all day, hanging out with horses, my older sis, and the dh, and meeting other like minded folks. We have 120 acres in Northern, Ca near Susanville,Ca, and we\u2019ve got wild mustang roaming our property\u2026which butts up to a huge BLM property that extends almost to Canada. Wendy-Welcome to the Jewels\u2026if you haven\u2019t had a chance to read through from the start\u2026it would get you caught up and give you an idea of the wonderful women you\u2019ve got yourself hooked up with here. And, we\u2019ve got t-shirts, so let golfer know if you want in on one\u2026they\u2019re great. Today, I wait from 10-2 for the delivery of our new fridg (counter depth stainless steel) and washer and dryer ( new LG that is so cool it knows how much water, the temp it needs, if the clothes are clean based on the rinse water- if not it does another cycle- and spins so fast when it is done that clothes are almost dry before hitting the dryer...money saving.) The house we bought as an investment for my son to live in will close today and needs a fridg and washer and dryer, so darn, I had to get newer stuff for me. HaHaHa. And of course, I need to take advantage of this sun and get out for another walk. SIS Kimberly",

Finding your new normal is the key...and talking about your feelings.

The police and fireman of our nation are a tight brotherhood for sure, and I\u2019ll be there were officers from all over the nation in attendance. What a wonderful gift he gave to those he served.

It will be my second since chemo started. Hair growing back already? I have nubs\u2026but then I shave my head with my electric shaver, so I don\u2019t have to deal with Velcro head.

I took my preventives starting the same day as my steroids and took them through to day 6 or so\u2026really helped. I\u2019ll be starting that routine again on Monday as infusion #3 is Tuesday.

I watched the Lost episode and Eli Stone from Thursday because our DVR didn\u2019t record it either, even though it is set for the series record and had no issues recording last week. Hmmmm. I\u2019m so jealous of people that are creative and do things like scrap booking. I am just not an artsy crafty girl. LJ13- Excellent insight into wvgirl\u2019s hubby. Take care of that chest congestion\u2026being tucked in and warm this weekend sounds like a good idea. wvgirl- I agree about the support we get here\u2026I wouldn\u2019t know what to do without all of you Jewels. It is good to know that the support group is another option, however. How sad about your cousin. Carol- Golfing at the range today\u2026I\u2019m so jealous. I don\u2019t know that I could get a good back swing yet. Hope you enjoyed yourself\u2026if it was half as nice there as it was here, you had a great day to hit some balls.

Hang in there\u2026it\u2019s only a few days of really blah\u2026like that makes it easier, huh? Take care of yourself. Joan- I have been thinking about you and your Mom.

Being on the go all day always made the days go by so fast. I\u2019m kind of enjoying the slow down\u2026although I really want to get back to the gym and work out with people around\u2026not just on my own in the family room. I see my ps on the 27th, so I\u2019ll ask him about getting back to the gym and what the restrictions might be. Paula- Man that is one perseverant cough\u2026I\u2019m sorry you haven\u2019t been sleeping. Can you take night time Nyquil or something to help you sleep through the night? There is nothing worse than feeling sleep deprived and laying there wanting to sleep and being unable due to the coughing. Hope you feel better soon\u2026not a good thing to be just out of infusion and sick, too. Take good care of yourself\u2026thank goodness you have an extra day to do just that.

I heard that your nails can get funky. My onc looked at my nails this past week to check their health. So far, so good. I\u2019m sorry you have to endure that kind of discomfort\u2026that is no fun! Speaking of fun, though, do enjoy your dd\u2019s 19th bday tonight. I\u2019m with you on needing to be really open with eachother when we\u2019re done with chemo and rads\u2026we will be that safe place for each other to fall apart.

How sweet of you to throw your hubby a little 50th bday bash with the Nascar 50th Anniversay theme\u2026very appropriate. Yeah, listening to your body really is key. And now that you know how your react, you\u2019ll be better prepared for tx #2. D1- I\u2019m so glad you had a good weekend with the college girl and that you sound up!!!! You last chemo will be done already\u2026wow!!!! Kris- I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re feeling so crappy\u2026I wish there was something I could do for you. Get lots of rest\u2026drink fluids\u2026Tylenol for the aches and pains\u2026make sure you check in with the doc if that temp goes up. ((((gentle HUGS)))) Carol- Glad to know that slow server thing wasn\u2019t just me. Yeah, getting in all the stuff before tx #3 wrestles me to the ground. I went to the house again this morning to wait for the carpet guy. He gave me a window of 9-10 for arriving, so I called at 10:15 to make sure everything was OK\u2026not lost or something. Got his message machine\u2026I didn\u2019t mind\u2026I was cozy on the love seat I gave to Jon from my office\u2026now in his little living room/dining room area reading a great book- A New Earth\u2026Oprah\u2019s Book Club choice\u2026really on the lines of what my heart and spirit have always known\u2026inspiring. She\u2019s offering a free 10 week class online, so I think I\u2019ll sign up\u2026should be interesting. Anyway, he told me right before I called to check if he was lost, he got a call from his Dad about his Uncle and Aunt, who he stated he wasn\u2019t really close to. His uncle had a heart attack this weekend, and his wife died two days later. Talk about a freaky one, two punch\u2026so my new philosophy of not sweating the small stuff came in handy. I\u2019ve got the night sweat thing going on too and fear I\u2019m going to get my period this week\u2026of all times\u2026it is a reminder that estrogen is alive and well surging in my body\u2026which is good for my body\u2026and unfortunately also good for my cancer. How sweet of you to help out your neighbor by getting input from our AC x4 then T x4 gals. Whoohoo on the good golf swing and the nine holes\u2026and not having to squeeze your butt cheeks. LOL Julie- I had the same experience\u2026it took forever to finally post! KathyL- Yep, it is slow again this morning\u2026so I\u2019m waiting to post this until this afternoon. Glad to hear you don\u2019t have to wait in huge lines to register your daughter for Kindergarten. We could collaborate on a book even if we are bi-coastal. I\u2019d love to do that with you. Thank goodness for the dh who takes the kids to preschool then comes home to work on the honey-do \u2018cause I don\u2019t know how to list. My dh is amazing with chores like that\u2026he knows things that just amaze me about all aspects of construction- home and landscape\u2026on top of so much more stuff. Wvgirl- I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling so tired\u2026 and falling and hurting your foot on top of it all\u2026geez! I\u2019m worried that your legs gave out on you\u2026are you sure you should be going to work if you aren\u2019t steady on your feet? ARDeb- Man, our Jewels are just dealing with flu, cold, falling injuries, and tooth absesses\u2026I hope your dentist can help you deal with that. And yeah, another Jewel has a root canal\u2026I can\u2019t recall who that was either off the top of my chemo brain. ((((Hugs)))) SheShe- Way to take control of your own health care!!!!! I\u2019d make the trip to get those record unless your new office will take care of getting them. Have you called your new office? I would also send a letter to your old oncologist and let him know what you stated about liking the care you got with him, the surgeon, and the hospital\u2026but not liking the chemo cancer center and why. They need to hear this, or they have no reason to improve. My hospital and health network send me surveys to find out how my experience has been, and so far I\u2019ve been very pleased with my care, but feel if I wasn\u2019t happy, they\u2019d take what I had to say into consideration. So maybe being sick- not that I\u2019m happy about you being sick for two weeks- was the universe giving you the kick in the rear to make this much needed change. I like to look for the message. 100 vs 11 is a huge help on so many levels- gas, time, and your energy spent. CarolC- I\u2019m glad the neuropathy is better than it was, but still not sounding too good to me. I\u2019m glad you listened to your body and came home early\u2026I\u2019m hoping the boss seeing you tip toe around and looking really tired sends a strong message that not everyone handles chemo as well as her friends claim they handled it. Take care sweetie. Weird about the every other letter thing. I compose in a word document as I read posts\u2026easier to recall what was said that way, then cut and paste it in when I\u2019m done. Try that. OK, so I\u2019m off to TX 3 tomorrow\u2026.I\u2019ll check in before I go. Have a good night all, SIS Kimberly",

Thankfully, like the weather here, the sun is finally starting to shine, and I feel as if I have been awakened from some altered state still groggy but aware that I\u2019ve missed time passing. Although I know how to head off the worst of the side effects\u2026dry nose, dry watery eyes, digestive discomforts from esophagus to colon, and bone pain, there is nothing I can do to stave off the exhaustion for it is more than exhaustion,since exhaustion is resolved by sleep, and sleep doesn\u2019t touch this. I have literally not had the energy to form thoughts beyond the basic, to comprehend with any retention what is said to me, nor to speak beyond the rudimentary for it is more than I can truly manage. Yesterday, it took the entire day to do three small loads of laundry, and I did so only to make my mark in this house for I feel as if I have been non-existent. My dear Jewels, thank you for checking on me this weekend, and I know you will forgive my inability to respond. Even now, on the other side, the reality of these past days has me feeling teary and fearful that with three more treatments left to go on top of radiation that I will disappear for a longer and longer period of time into this fog. I have tried so hard to talk myself out of these tears, for I know that all is as it should be, but they come anyway, and so I let them\u2026as it should be...good for the soul. On a brighter note, I AM on the other side, and I do know there are 15 days albeit energy sparing days on the downhill slide before I must face this fog once again\u2026only this time with a new vision\u2026a warm blanket wrapped around me to keep me safe while my body uses its energies to heal itself. I\u2019m half way through chemo\u2026and with all of your love and support, I know I, and Super Girl, will be ready for round #4 on March 11th. I also have chemo dates on April 1st, which D1 I fantazise about having my onc. nurses say, \"April Fools, you don't have to be here anymore!!!\" My last chemo is on April 22. Reading...forget it!!!! I too can't seem to concentrate on much more than a magazine. Seems many of us have hit that mid-point...that I just don't want to feel like c#^p anymore...I want my life back...blues. I'm thankful for those of you here to give our blue Jewels...that would make you Saphires, eh?...a boost. We can do this gals!!!! For those of you with great kids stories...BRAVO...skating, basketball, being there for a friend, using the potty...just being great all around kids...it is all a testiment to the value you've instilled in them. My boy moved into the new house this weekend. His auntie, my twin, went over to help them put their kitchen together and my dh laid tile in the masterbath. I so wanted to be there for he ds, but he understood...and Auntie Mommy was there, so he was good with that. Too many posts to do shout outs individually, but I promise I'll keep up starting after my own post...thankfully no one has tx today. All my love, Kimberly",

      "Content": "Mar 8, 2008 12:15PM - edited Mar 9, 2008 01:56PM by SISKimberly Good Saturday Morning Jewels, Again the sun is shining, the little tree outside my office window is starting to get little pink buds, and I'm off for an adventure in Calistoga (in the Napa Valley Wine Country) for some Jazz and Wine- although not too much for me. I had a nice Hahn Pinot last night with dinner, but couldn't eat my whole meal. Ate half, so I've got salmon for another meal this weekend. Peg- You're so welcome...supporting one another is what we Jewels are all about. Yep, Miralax is something many of us have tried for the ol pooper problems, and many of us swear by this little miracle...unless we take too much by miscalculation eh, Carol? Julie-Already starting to feel foggy? I'm sorry to hear that the se's have snuck up so quickly. But, you'll be healthy and strong during this bout- blood counts up, tummy cooperative, pooper under control, and that's all there is to it darn it!!!! Take care sweetie. Carol- There is a way once on photobucket to choose the size of the pic. It can also be done on their computer before uploading it to photobucket. OH, CHJ, that is a much easier fix. BRAVO!!!! Good news on the ds' grade status! Oh, your trip to Mesa sounds delightful, and meeting a fellow CMFer while there is such a bonus! About the positive thinking thing...I do believe that our intentions are powerful, so wording our thoughts and words in the positive provides for a better outcome...and in kids, it is found to have a significant impact on their behavior...it's a mind game. Hope your had a great evening with your man, once he got home, and that the Chinese food was yummy. Jenn- I'm so glad writing in Word and then cutting and pasting has given you such joy (heehee). It is true that the simplest things can be so great! Tinalee, thank you for passing on that suggestion as you were correct in stating that I'd given a fellow Jewel that tip after losing her post awhile back. Sure saved me from going through pads and pads of sticky notes as I tried to keep up on the shout outs. WhooHoo on the free PT treatments. What a wonderful win-win situation. Glad you're checkin' in as you can, Jenn. LWDana- I'm so glad that you were able to get out an take a walk with a friend. I think that you need to do what is right for you, and if doing walks, work, school, sleep, or whatever works, then go for it!!!! Foggy- check. Forgetful-check. Eating everything in sight- Uh, no! Glad you can. Wvgirl- I'm glad all went well yesterday and the dh was there. Take it easy this weekend and rest up for your mile walk on Monday. I think that's a great idea to walk a mile a day for 100 days. It might improve you overall fatigue and sleep issues. OMG, laughed out loud about the writing pens in the dishwasher!!! Kathy- Wow, talk about a whirlwind schedule yesty and this weekend. You must be feeling good!!!! I miss the little things about Jon being a kid...like Easter baskets and egg hunts. I wonder if he'd think I was a total dork ( he already knows I am, but that's beside the point) getting him a grown-up basket and doing an egg hunt at his house with the roomies- eggs filled with dollar bills (starving college kids you know). A fun idea to consider. A big boy bed...such a huge milestone! Vettegal- Sorry you had a reaction,again, but it didn't sound like it was as bad...so here's to a better bout of se's this time around!!!! Loved your signing in story...and I say, if she was offended...oh well, she'll get over it. Glad the other gals caught on and enjoyed it. Did I know your mom was having treatments...for?...and my chemo brain can't access that file or what? Can't wait to see you in your biker bitch hat. SheShe- I'm sorry you're having such a rough time, but it will pass soon. Here's to a bone scan that shows your healthy strong bones!!!! Take care of yourself. D1- Wow, your drive does sound harrowing. That's good to note...fatigue sneaks up on you, so be careful about driving long distances. Good thing the college girl could have taken over driving on the way home if you needed her to drive. That's awesome that your daughter did as well as she did with dyslexia and other learning issues. With her positive attitude (and some firm boundaries at home), it's no wonder. Glad you've got some fun planned for the visit home. LJ13- WhooHoo on the easy infusion, and the doc's visit...wow! Mine is right next door as well, but he probably figures since he sees me the day prior to the infusion, he doesn't need to stop by. I'll bet your dps' run in's might have had a part in that visit. Glad to hear your drugs can be lessened so you aren't a zombie. OK, got to go. Our friends will be here in 20 minutes, and I haven't showered. SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Mar 19, 2008 06:41PM - edited Mar 20, 2008 12:39PM by SISKimberly Good Afternoon Jewels, OK, so this one is kicking me in the butt!!!!!  I\u2019m usually feeling a lot better by now, but I literally have so little energy I can\u2019t stand it! CHJ- (((HUGS))) no need to apologize for being AWOL!!!  We all have our own ways of dealing with this and feeling down being ½ way through is sooooo normal, my blue Jewel\u2026just look at all the Jewels who were blue before you at the half way point and remember, you propped them up!!!!  That is what it is all about\u2026leaning on the one who is strong because when you\u2019re strong, someone will need to lean on you. WhooHooo on tasting and liking the Sangria.  Bummer your gal butchered the wig, but maybe it isn\u2019t as bad as you think it is when others see it.  What does the dh think? I know that must be stressful trying to sell the house now and making two mortgage payments, I assume. Any chance of getting renters and re-listing when the market bounces back eventually?  A rental is a pretty good tax write off.  Just a thought. The \u201cHow are you?\u201d question is a tough one\u2026 it depends on who it is.  If it is someone not in my close knit group, I just say, Today is a good day\u2026or I\u2019ve felt better. For my friends, I know they really want to know, but I limit the conversation to a very limited time.  I\u2019m beating bc,and it isn\u2019t who I am, so I don\u2019t want to define myself by it. Of course, on days I\u2019m feeling like pond scum, or peat in a moor, I must remind myself that this is not going to last forever!!!! Dana- I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re feeling good!!!  Deb- Did you see what kind of a semi it was? I'm right there with you gal.  Hang in there. CathyCa- I love that you have a Persian Market and those vivid colors and smells and the signs of spring all sound so wonderful.  I agree that the end of chemo is a huge deal and that spring and renewal should be celebrated!!!! So Happy New Year to you and all our Jewels, too. Julie- Hope your day at school went well today. Paula- I just watched the Dancing With the Stars episode from last night, too.  I love that show. Carol- Well, I\u2019ll bet those squirrels got a giggle at your \u2018nut\u2019 on the ole noggin\u2019.  Those head bumps really hurt, especially when you are truly and totally surprised by the event!!!!  Hope you washed it really well and put some antibiotic cream on it, just in case there was even the smallest knick\u2026don\u2019t want an infection. Tinalee- Sorry about the dh being ill, but glad he was able to help you see the light of allowing your colleagues to help you in the only way they know how.  Good for you!!!! You hit it right on the head\u2026sorry Carol\u2026with your insight about your bro being sad for you and not knowing how to react. Seeing us bald is a HUGE reminder to many friends and family members of the BIG C, and whatever that means to them, including their own mortality.  It\u2019s a reminder they are helpless in making it go away for you and that hurts them, so if they look away, it\u2019s OK.  They aren\u2019t trying to hurt us\u2026they are coping with it the best way they can with the tools they have\u2026and who among us was given a guide book on how to handle bc? MAZ (((((HUGS)))) I was moved to tears about the news about your bff.  I know that my words have no power to help you make heads or tails of this right now, so I will be here quietly listening and being present in your moment. D1- Well said words of comfort to MAZ!!!! And how sad about your friend with colon cancer. Glad you\u2019ve taken that situation, and your own, and used it to remind others to take their annual exams. Therese- Oh, it\u2019s is totally OK to listen to the side that says, I\u2019m going to whine to the Jewels about this because they will totally get it!!!!  And we do.  It is so normal after being in tx and then nothing to be hyperaware.  Allow yourself to ask\u2026when I exercised like this before, was I sore?  Did it go away in just one day?  You will certainly feel twinges from surgery even now as nerves take a long time to heal as will any tendons stretched for lymph removal.  Be patient with yourself and concentrate on the fact that you are exercising and taking care of yourself. Turn your unknown into your known\u2026right now at this moment is known. That\u2019s the focus. CarolC- Congrats on your last tx and thank you for your kind words about my foot in mouth incident.  I saw the GMA interview as well and didn\u2019t know about the foundation.  And yeah for Spring tomorrow!!!!  Let\u2019s hope it brings sunshine to you all!!!! Kris- Thanks for the article link. I had already read this during my massive radiation and HT suppression research marathon over the past few weeks\u2026well, not last week or this week as I\u2019ve been in the fog. LJ13- You are right that no cancer is good cancer\u2026it all sucks, but we do have control over how we choose to deal with it, right?  Even when we're blue...we have the choice to feel blue as we should honor those feelings, and then suddenly, we see a light and we're able to move forward again!!!! OK, that took forever to read and post and it wasn't even that much compared to yesterday. Oh well, it is what it is!!!!  SIS Kimberly ",

Get yourself to the doctor...it is most likely benign...but if it isn't...ignoring it won't be helpful. I am a teacher and believe knowledge is power. My intention is not to freak you out, but to say with an open heart and good intentions and a little tough love that no one is too young. My hairdresser's friend's son found a lump in his testical at 16, and it was cancer. Had he ignored it, he'd not be alive today. Do not ignore this. I can't say to anyone you're too young to get breast cancer or testicular cancer because the fact is cancer doesn't descriminate. Our food is packed with preservatives and additives that affect our hormones, and that can mess with your body. Girls are developing breasts and getting their mentrual cycles earlier and earlier, which means they've got more hormones streaming their systems at a younger age. Again, it is most likely benign, but not taking care of yourself by getting yourself to a doctor... with your mom... is not going to make your lump go away. Make an appt. today to get yourself seen as soon as possible. I hope to hear back from you that you have done so and to report that all is well!!! Annie, hope all is well with you.

I've had a little more energy everyday, so I'm liking that.  Another low grade fever last night, but fine today.  All your nurses, is that normal to have your temp go up at night?  I run high 96 to low 97 usually.  My lowest was 95.5.  My high was 101.6. Still not up to major shout outs, but read everything since my last post.  Thank you all for being so wonderful. Carol, my son played roller hockey in high school, just on rec teams for fun. Glad to hear your ds was able to get out there and show them what he's made of today. No new injuries is always a win. Vettegal- no hair to report.  Well done on the blind date set up! D1- Poor Frankenboob. I'm a whitey like you. Doesn't take much to burn my sensitive skin.  Even tape (paper, transderms, or anything that sticks to my skin) leaves it red and irritated for days.  Tina- Happy Anniversary. Enjoy your dinner tonight. Kathy- A buttery chard would have paired better than the Reisling.  A Reisling is really nice if there is a kick of spice to a meal, but shell fish is rich and needs that buttery citrus a chard can bring to a meal.  How sweet to wish you were closer to help me out. Believe me, your words of support like those of all our Jewels, is so healing and appreciated. SheShe- Join in. See my most post prior to this one for info. Paula- Your day with the kids and the big visit sounded like a huge honor. The gov. being there was huge...maybe that means your funding won't disappear now that the gov. sees the good work you all do there. Therese- Thanks for giving us the update from the other side.  I can't even imagine hair right now.  I'll check in tomorrow, gals. Speaking of gal, where is wvgal?  Is anyone in contact with her? Sleep well ladies, and I'll be thinking of you CathyCA tomorrow.  Sorry the weather wasn't as wonderful as it could have been for your visit to the Capital City. SIS Kimberly ",

Aren\u2019t hugs great!!!!! Love that picture of you and Steph, Carol. Glad you had an uneventful trip to the lounge.  And, BRAVO, on printing out our shout-outs.  I know that when my twinsis forwards my updates to her colleagues, they respond with such support,and she sends those comments to me, which really brightens my day. Thanks for your detailed description of how the ds did with the whole infusion center thing. Wow, what a great kid you\u2019ve raised, Carol. I love that he wears a hat that says, I wear pink for my mom. Gooshy feelings all around. About the tattoo. D1 hit that nail right on the head! So ditto what she said!  My son is tattoed down his back and on his chest (it\u2019s all very symbolic he says about family and friends), but he made sure that it could not be seen when he dressed for work. He paid for it and was not living at home when he did, however.  I always told Jon, when he lived at home, that if you can convince me you\u2019ve really looked at all sides of a choice and the consequences, both short and long term, I\u2019ll support you. When he was in 8th or 9th grade, he wanted his ear pierced, so he had to write me a proposal outlining the pros and cons. He did a great job, and I let him do it. Here\u2019s to light se\u2019s this next few days, and what are you thinking with that schedule next week? Tx on Wed, and then busy all week and the weekend with potential se\u2019s to manage on top of it all.  Man, you are preparing for a 60 mile walk, aren\u2019t you?  Glad you\u2019re getting your ducks in a row, however, as like me, you need a plan. Tina- Yeah, on the last expander fill. The increased tightness is no fun, but once it relaxes it isn\u2019t so bad.  Are you hyper aware of the expanders?  I mean, do they feel \u2018heavy\u2019 against your chest? I know the back is double thick and the material is very different from the permanent implants which I\u2019ve been assured will not feel this way. OH, I can\u2019t wait to be able to taste wine again and sushi. Right now, my taste buds are just shot. I am literally down to a very short list of things that even have taste right now. I had to buy some vegan protein powder to mix in my fruit smoothie (no dairy, no soy milk) so I can get enough or at least some protein in my diet. Eggs used to be my mainstay, but even eggs aren\u2019t right anymore. Tuna isn\u2019t horrible, so I try to have tuna daily as well. Oh, chili (sigh) \u2026I hope it was fabulous and truly the send off winter wants to finally exit stage left. Kathy- Wow, you have been busy, but how exciting to get back to the world of \u2018normal\u2019 and with a new job you\u2019re so right for. Good luck with your meeting with the old boss today, and at the ps to get those spider legs removed. Poor Christian. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be able to do as well as he might have with his injury. And Shannon needed to go. It was her time. I agree with D1 that this \u2018relationship\u2019 will only last until the next big thing. Julie- The reconstruction appt is a whole other enchilada\u2026it\u2019s the \u2018I\u2019m done and am rebuilding\u2019 appt.  How exciting for you.  Glad it\u2019s on Friday, cause it sounds like today and the fight for sections might be intense, and you\u2019ll need a pick me up. D1- I swear it was pulled out of a dusty file cabinet filled with Jewel kid stories, and I just hoped I got it right. Glad you are going to have an open mind about the ooph thing. I\u2019m all for doing what I can without chemicals, and if an ooph is just as effective as taking some drug for the next five years, I\u2019m all over that. I\u2019m also all for listening to what docs have to say, but like I\u2019ve said in the past, many of them haven\u2019t read all of the research cause who has time to do that, and those relative numbers given vs absolute numbers is what is always given to patients, and where do those numbers come from? The companies that sponsor the studies also just happen to be the companies who make the most profit from the treatments being offered. Sounds like a conflict of interest to me. I know, I sound cynical, don\u2019t I? But really, I will listen with an open mind. If she can prove to me with absolute numbers that rads will have a significant benefit for me compared to the risks, I\u2019ll do it. PALady- I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ll be done by Wed. of next week all ready. It seems like you just started, and D1 is counting down as well. It must feel good to know that you\u2019re almost done with going every day\u2026that\u2019s got to wear on you. I know just going to the infusion center every day for my antibiotic for 22 days was a lot. Also glad to hear that your skin is holding up well. Well, all caught up for now. I\u2019ll check back in later. Have a great day, gals. SIS Kimberly",

OK, so I\u2019ve been busy looking at what there is to do in Flagstaff and Sedona all morning. There is lots to choose from. I\u2019m so ready!!!! I didn\u2019t get to work on my vision board yesterday. I need to go through magazines and tear out pics that speak to me, and I wasn\u2019t in that space.  I need to be alone with quiet music and no interruptions, and the dh was home all day working from home. Today, I'm going to school for a visit, then off to do some SP shopping and maybe get something new for my trip. Joan- I\u2019m so glad your tanning sessions are going well and that you\u2019ll be getting on a better tanning schedule as of next week. Your school year ends late. We are out the first week in June. You must not start until after Labor Day. Happy Birthday, Joan. Celebrate big time!!!! Kathy- I knew your shadow day would be much better than just sitting and listening. And speaking of shadow, a five o\u2019clock shadow on the ole melon sounds encouraging.  Score on getting in on the Nurse\u2019s luncheon. Good timing on the return to work. Gotta have perks, eh? Like Carol said, seeing old friends at a memorial isn\u2019t the best of circumstances, but like Maz stated after Val\u2019s funeral, a time that can be very healing. Carol- What\u2019s up with the tummy complaining now?  Bummer. I\u2019m thinking the whole shooting match is a good plan. I\u2019ll have to get my oncologist to schedule an appointment with a gynecological surgeon for a consult, too.  Thank goodness you listened to your gut on the potential for getting an exam along with the consult talk, and that you used the correct washcloth. HeeHee Glad you got a good night sleep. Being up since 4am might have had something do with that. Glad to hear your new bc friend is doing OK after surgery, and so impressed with your ability to help others feel better about the whole process.  Kalen will probably enjoy meeting another bc gal. Nothing like having the support of those who have been there. Happy BDay to Kyle!!!! Good luck at Regionals this weekend. LWDana- I love that Chicken Little reference in combination with Dr. Suess\u2019 children\u2019s book, Are You My Mother? I\u2019m sorry Tamox has such bad se\u2019s for you. I hope your doc can help you out with that. Paula- Good description of what the rads machine is doing, and LOL on the nips announcing how cold you are.  One perk of a mastectomy. No bra required and no more worries of the high beams turning on at inopportune times. Ashland is in Oregon. It is the home of the Ashland Shakespeare Festival. They do modern plays as well, which is nice.  I go every year with my gf on Labor Day weekend, but we\u2019ve added a trip with the boys in July this year. We stay at the same B&B, Country Willows Inn, and visit our favorite restaurants and wine bar. Julie- Where do you find those cute graphics?  So perfect!!!! PALady- Glad to hear that your cleansing tears have lightened your spirit. WhooHoo!!! I need to go shopping for my SP and while out, I plan to get that book, The Last Lecture. A Vision Board is a way of visualizing and manifesting what you want in your life by putting out your intentions to the universe. The law of attraction. It isn\u2019t exactly a New Earth concept, but it certainly is a positive energy thing that I\u2019m sure Ekhart would totally agree with. I loved watching the webcasts and will be reading A New Earth a second time now that I\u2019m able to focus more clearly on what I\u2019m reading with no more chemo. I agree that Kristi and Jason will be in the finals. Marissa deserved one last shot as she really has improved, but she\u2019s out this next round for sure unless Cristian is unable to do the one armed dancing this next week.  Mario just hasn\u2019t been consistent with his last few dances in my opinion. I\u2019m glad he did this, however, as it gives young kids a new view of dance styles besides Hip Hop and all. Yep, I think a lot of us gals will be busy this weekend, so the boards might be slow, which could be a plus as there won\u2019t be too much to catch up on when Monday rolls around. Thinking of you wvgirl and Peg1212.  wvgirl- You only have one more after this. You\u2019re so close.  Peg- Congrats on your last one!!!! Patty, thinking of you and Denise.  ((((HUGS)))) SIS Kimberly I'm going to PM Jenn and make sure she's OK. ",

I totally understand wanting to throw everything at it and know you did everything you could to prevent a recurrence should that happen.  I believe that the bilateral mastectomy and aggressive chemo is everything I need to do. Surgery got the cancer out, and chemo was my insurance policy.  I don't need more insurance.  I'm not a regrets kind of person. I know that I wouldn't kick myself about not doing rads because I would know there were no guarantees, and that I had a chance of recurrence even if I did do it. I did get a second opinion. My surgeon, whom I trust more than my oncologist even though he's a very nice man.  Again, thank you so much for caring about me and sharing your concern.

      "Content": "Jun 3, 2008 12:49PM - edited Jun 3, 2008 01:53PM by SISKimberly Well, so much for getting back to the posts last night. After my appointment with the onc, who was not pleased with my decisions not to do rads and Tamox, but who will get over it after his two week vacation in Greece, I went to the bank and grocery store. By the time I got home to unload groceries and start dinner, I was pooped. Oh well, the best laid plans of mice and men, eh? Trip Highlights: We arrived in Flagstaff, but our bags decided to vacation elsewhere. Greg had one of his, so he had clothes. I hate schlepping around my suitcase, so I was sans clothes for three days. No biggie to me\u2026if I\u2019ve learned one thing since my diagnosis it is don\u2019t sweat the small stuff. Apparently the universe was reminding me of how little one needs.  I had to do a little shopping as I figured  wearing the same thing for days in a row and not brushing my teeth might have been a real turn off to folks - socks, underwear, a couple of shirts, toothpaste, toothbrush, sunscreen, and a hoodie as it was only in the 60\u2019s. Thanksfully, the bags arrived the evening before we were to depart for Sedona. We stayed at Little America, which is a hotel set in a forested area at the back of the hotel, but the front was on a major street. It was a nice older hotel that has tried to modernize itself with new curtains, bedding, and a flat screen TV hung on the wall, but the rest of the room was filled with what I call a Victorian meets 70\u2019s look.   Lots of fabulous Native American, Pueblo Indian, ruins and cliff dwellings. Amazing that these people were able to farm and survive in often times extreme conditions with little water in many places.  Walnut Canyon is where the Sinagua, in approximately 600 built cliff dwellings and lived for almost 100 years. They were not the first inhabitants, however, as Archiac nomad artifacts have been found that date back prior to 600. Wupatki National Park has ruins of a 100 room pueblo built by the Sinagua who moved into the valley near the bottom of Sunset Crater after it, the youngest of a series of volcanoes,  erupted between 1040 and 1100. The Grand Canyon\u2026how can one even begin to describe the majesty of that view?  Pictures are often spectacular, but to see it in person is breathtaking.  We saw it both up close and personal via a ground tour with a Navajo Indian guide whose name was O\u2019sana Kibet O (spelled phonetically), but who asked us to call him by his Irish given name, Milton. He was very knowledgeable about the history, geology, geography, and of course the Native American cultures that resided in the canyon area. He had a great wit, too. He brought a scope so that we could see things other tours never showed their guests and visited many sights around the South and East rims. It was a long day, but so worth it. We also viewed the canyon from a helicopter. Wow, what a treat that was. We took the hour flight. Our pilot was a young whipper snapper named Josh. The older folks on the tour, and of course I am not in that category, questioned him on his age and experience. Funny. The big news, I was the co-pilot!!!! When we went over the rim, it was so amazing!!!! We also saw the Little Colorado, which is turquoise in color due to calcium carbonate for about three miles as it connects to the Colorado River. The 30 minute tour doesn\u2019t take passengers over the rim or to the Little Colorado, and there is no way to see it from any other vantage point unless you take the raft trip down the river, which is a 14 day event. No thank you!!! That would require camping out and really roughing it.  Anyway, there was a camera connected to the bottom of the helicopter that captured our tour and our voices, so we got a DVD for a very reasonable price. Lowell Observatory- saw Saturn with its rings in a more vertical than horizontal orientation. So cool!!!! We looked through the same telescope that discovered Pluto\u2026and I\u2019m saying Pluto is still a planet!!!!  Also, with a smaller telescope in the smaller of the two observatories, saw the six star formation within the Big Dipper\u2019s handle that looks like two stars called Myzar (sp?\u201d). Also went to the Museum of Northern Arizona and was lucky enough to be there for the 18th Annual Zuni Festival of Arts and Culture. Saw Zuni dancers...spectacular regalia. I purchased a wolf fetish-fetishes bring good luck- made of Picasso Marble. The wolf fetish is symbolic of teacher, pathfinder on never-ending journey for survival. Is that so me or what?  No wonder I have loved wolves for so long!!!  Sedona has two faces \u2013 the upper class prostitute with her tourist traps, and the beautiful native maiden, the Red Rocks, with her numerous gorgeous trails and mysterious energies. You really can feel the energy there. I did some meditation there and really felt grounded. One meditation was at the Ampitagha Stupa, a Buddhist temple built by the spiritual director of the Kunzang Palyul Choling Tibetan Buddhist centers. The grounds are still a  work in progress, but it was still interesting. We visited a cliff dwelling site called Montezuma\u2019s Castle- not connection to the Aztec King- and Montezuma\u2019s Well. The well was one of my favorite places on the trip. It was so beautiful there and so serene if you get there right when they open thus avoiding lots of people. We saw petrogliffs and pictographs that date back into very early history and an early Native American calendar was part of that early stone art. We stayed at the Sedona Rouge, which was very nice newer hotel, and had some great meals. Much better dining choices than Flagstaff, although we didn\u2019t venture to the older downtown section more than to drive through. Too many people since school was just getting out. I\u2019ve got a maid service coming to give me a quote. They are a Green Clean company, so they use no harmful chemicals. Afterwards, I need to get the ole port flushed and then off to school to clean off my shelves as a retiring teacher and I are switching shelving units - her\u2019s are way nicer than mine. Paula, here\u2019s a big hug to you and your family. I hope all goes well at Duke. ((((HUGS)))) Jenn51, I\u2019m so glad you are finding your way back to the light side of life. I know that the emotional trauma from this whole bc thing is overwhelming at times and on top of losing your friend and a not so emotionally involved dh. I was so sorry to hear both of these things. I think you had a great idea when you suggested to Carla, WVgirl, support each other. Maybe you could exchange numbers and talk. As I said in my card and email, if you need to talk, just let me know. I\u2019d love to be a support to you. Carol, man what an up and down few days you had, but so glad all worked out in the positive!!!  You\u2019re right about your walking and just living your life being what brought your counts back up. WhooHoo. D1- Your trip sounded amazing, and as usual you reported it with such flare. Cracked me up!!!! Dana- Hang in there sweetie. Keep reminding yourself that you deserve to be happy and loved, and be so proud of your positive outlook for yourself. Heck ya, you touched the heart of that doc\u2026you\u2019ve got a loving spirit, girl. About the ex- don\u2019t waste the energy hating him. He\u2019s doing what he\u2019s learned works for him\u2026it doesn\u2019t work for you anymore because you\u2019ve grown. Just bless the relationship\u2019s gifts to you as hard as it may have been to receive them and let it go. Tina and Dana- Sorry to hear about your pets. Putting down an animal, or thinking about having to do it due to ill health is so difficult.  ((((HUGS)))) Kathy- Love the stories of the kids\u2026it is such a blessing to be able to be apart of their lives, isn\u2019t it?  I tell ya, cancer has given me so many gifts, and really appreciating all that we have and all of our experiences and loved ones is part of the package for me, too. Can't believe you're getting your tatoos already. Wasn't it just yesty you had nips placed? How quickly time seems to be going when compared to being in the middle of it all.  Norma- Your \u2018cation sounded fun, too. If there is a way to get back to your friends, go for it! CHJ- Congrats on the move!!!! Julie, Tina, and LJ13- glad to hear that surgeries have gone well and healing is occuring without too much incidence. Such good news LJ13 regarding your surgery getting everything and all looking so good. OK, I can\u2019t remember everything I read yesty, so suffice it to say\u2026I love you, gals, and am so glad to hear from those who have been MIA and to know that we are all here for each other. Gotta go, the cleaning gal will be here in short order and I'm still in my \"Age gets better with wine\" sleep shirt on and fuzzy slippers.  Man life is good. I\u2019ll check back later. Have a great day Jewels. SIS Kimberly PS Got a gift from my SP in the mail. A ceramic spoon, a hysterical Pink Flamingo gift set with info about how the flamingo became the kitsch of American yards, and three magnets: Laugh, Dance, and Friend. The card was perfect...Focus on the important decisions- red or white wine? heehee...and I can't taste wine, now, and other foods!!!! WHOOHOO!!! ",

I\u2019m still feeling cording in my left arm and shoulder. I\u2019ve asked about physical therapy, but so far I\u2019m told, I'm  doing well with my range of motion and it will just take time.  Hmmmm, it\u2019s been 8 months.  I think I\u2019ll get my regular doc to set it up once I\u2019m recouped from the exchange surgery. I\u2019m so excited for you getting the painting done tomorrow. You are so going to love the way it looks, and then watch out\u2026the bug will bite ya. Isn\u2019t that how it goes. You do one room, then the others pale in comparison, so you end up eventually getting the entire house done room by room? Yep, my \u2018cation was very good for my mind, body, and soul,and I am looking forward to my next \u2018cation to Chicago with the twinsis at the end of June. That second study sounds like a great one to be involved with. I think it is great that you\u2019re giving back by helping with research that will help other women in the future. So, my hair update is: I lost all of my lashes and eye brow hairs, but I think I have some peach fuzz forming where my eyebrows once resided. Hard to tell as they\u2019re so light. My head is like a fuzzy peach. People like to rub my head since my hair is so soft. It\u2019s about an 1/8 of inch. No pigment as of this moment, so who knows what the end result might be. I have some hair growing on my legs, too. Bummer, I was hoping to get through the summer without shaving. Oh well. No hair on the nether region, however. LJ13- That is such great news\u2026WHOOHOO!!! I\u2019m so happy for you and your dp.  Your news just shows how strong chemo is, and as CathyCa stated, that surgery and chemo together have wiped this cancer out. Congratulations!!!! Party tonight at LJ13\u2019s house. CathyCa- Copper Canyon\u2026hmmm, never heard of it before. I\u2019ll have to look into that as it sounds interesting. What part of Mexico is it located? Jenn- You sound better and better, girlfriend. So glad our dear Carol was able to cheer you and lend an ear. Man, what is with the storms? Didn\u2019t you just barely get spring going? Hope you enjoy your pizza. In my book, splurging once in awhile on things you really enjoy just has to be done! Carol- Sounds like all is well with you as well even after your tx on Monday. Yeah!!!!  Enjoy your Relay for Life meeting with Kalen and her dh. Consider the viewing of the helicopter trip on the agenda. Tina- OK, so here\u2019s my berry bush story. When I was a kid living in Aptos, near Santa Cruz, we walked down hills filled with tall grasses and back up to the train trestle, which took us to our little grocery where we\u2019d spend birthday money on treats. We didn\u2019t get sweets in our house very often. Anyway, one time we didn\u2019t time it well and had to dash down the tracks to avoid being train bait. We had no choice but to leap into the berry bushes just at the edge of the tressle. OUCH!!!!!  But, those berries sure tasted good when we picked them after playing all day. OK, gotta go make dinner.  Check in with you in the morning before I head out to the ps for my pre-op appt. SIS Kimberly OH Heck, Julie and D1 were composing as I was composing. I'll get to those in the next post down. ",

Oh well, another chance to take myself out to a movie since Greg can\u2019t take time off next week. The movie yesty, Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, was not as good as the first two in my opinion, but I certainly see the draw for the younger audiences getting them all set for a new Indy.  It wasn\u2019t a bad movie; it just didn\u2019t have the same allure as the first two for me. So, I\u2019m taking my sponge bath getting ready this morning and notice that some little creature had walked down my right side and just taken a bite every few steps or so all the way down. Doesn\u2019t itch, just raised bumps all in a line. No squished bug in the bed, so he definitely had his fill and left without so much as a thank you. Man, I hope he doesn\u2019t invite his friends over tonight. Anyway, Greg and I went out to breakfast this morning at one of our favorite places in Sacramento. While sitting at a window table enjoying the beautiful morning, an older balding guy with neatly trimmed graying hair, a t-shirt and shorts went riding by on a red beachcomber with a basket in the front\u2026made me smile. After breakfast, it was off to the ps to get the tubes removed. What a relief!!!!! I still have restrictions as far as lifting and pulling ect\u2026 but I can sleep on my side and take a shower now. Yippee!!!! Kathy- Good job on posting the pics.  Love the In Honor of the Jewels luminaria, and despite that look of \u201cWhat have I gotten myself into holding this bird\u201d on your face, you\u2019re lookin\u2019 good!!! Carol- OK, we\u2019ll uncork it while you\u2019re here\u2026that means we will have to drink two bottles though, since you technically would have gotten two glasses each out of the one sent. Oh, Darn. And Darn again that your rads doc isn\u2019t a babydoc, but a gal\u2026yep, kind of ruins the whole stimulation sexual enuendo I was going for. Yeah, haven\u2019t been much of a news buff lately, but smelled the smoke this morning as the wind must have blown it our way. This afternoon, not a scent of smoke to be smelled. Hooray for your older Bro getting you up and out. Bet that felt good to walk and talk. And a big WhooHoo for the last time Cream of Wheat will be your dinner due to a crummy se tummy!!!! I\u2019m sending out a rainbow assortment of positive energy vibes Steph\u2019s way. When you see him again, give him a great big hug from me and tell him you\u2019re wrapping him up in lots of good wishes from the Jewels. D1- Congrats to your dd on her Excellence in American Lit Award and for scoring a perfect score on her standardized writing test. I do understand her response, however. It is written so that any kid who has done the preparation through K-12 can pass.  Unfortunately, not every child does do the preparation - classwork and homework and studying ect\u2026 One pound on your little pup is equal to at least 10 on us\u2026poor thing is going to feel deprived when you cut back the treats and food. I can just hear the news being told to the other pups in the neighborhood, \u201cOn top of making me workout and starve, she\u2019s going to put me under and brush my teeth!\u201d Joan \u2013 LOL on feeling like your classroom whiteboard\u2026not that I\u2019m laughing at any discomfort you might have had\u2026just imagining your techs placing the mark(s) and then eyeing them and saying, \u201cNope that isn\u2019t right,\u201d and erasing them to start again\u2026apparently several times. Kris- WhooHoo only 4 more to go.  Hope your dd\u2019s appt. went well. Good to hear from you. You sound good! Norma- HI!!! WhooHoo on a clear PET!!!  And, I say, heck, while you\u2019re in the groove of seeing docs, you might as well get all those appt. you\u2019ve been putting off taken care of now. I\u2019m sorry to hear about your ex bil\u2019s Stage 4 diagnosis. I hope his onc finds a treatment plan that works for him. I hate that his cancer is rare and found in someone so young. My neighbor pointed out that I\u2019m getting my eye brows back. I was standing outside chatting, so I must have been hit just right by the sunlight. No eyelashes yet, and poking you in the eye when they come in doesn\u2019t sound fun at all. The nether region hair is starting to come in very slowly and dark, but my leg hair has just come in all at once. It\u2019s all pretty fine and light, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to shave yet as I know once I start, it will come in thicker and darker. Well, ending on a hairy note isn't as weird as ending on my peeing habits, eh D1? Hope you are all enjoying a beautiful day. SIS Kimberly",

Still waiting for full coverage. Almost 8 weeks out - this Tuesday will be 8 weeks- from my last tini, so I anticipate that by the end of July I will have full coverage and maybe enough to look close to the short hair I had before bc.

Kathy, I am so releived that everything was fine. Sounded like you were ready to faint...clammy and all. Had you eaten?  Sometimes low blood sugar can cause that. I'm sorry you went to that dark place. I know how to make home made weapons for protection against those monsters in the dark, although you have to be awake to use them.  I'm glad you've figured out that the wheepies come with your cycle, Carol. Sounds like you, Dana, and D1 are all having quite to time with crazy hormones. I turned in my letter with neighbors' signatures today. We'll see. Our response was due by July 25th. Why would someone want to put up a fence in such a beautiful area? It is crazy that some people want to hide behind their fences instead of being seen by the neighbors. And turn a three bedroom into a one bedroom? What is up with that? That's not going to do anything for resale value for sure. Your poor weiner dogs are not going to like being fenced out of their neighborhood by those interlopers.  I can sick my HOA on them. D1, BTW, I didn't go out and get those Sun Chips. I decided to work my way through the craving. It worked. What did you decide to munch on after your post? Dana, I'm so sorry that the Tamox is being such a PITA.  I hope that it is shrinking tumors like crazy so that you can at least know the se's are worth it. ((((HUGS))) Paula, Ed must have been feeling really good, eh? IYKWIM? Good luck with the drill this morning. I'm sure your students will do great. Afterall, they had you as their teacher. OK, I'm going to try to get some shut eye. Nite Nite, SIS Kimberly ",

We got my Study Skills class outlined pretty specifically and my Language Arts class outlined in a way that will make my life a bit easier down the line. Now, I just need to get the first few units put together so I\u2019m ahead of the game when school starts, and then put future units together once the school years begins. Tahoe was beautiful. It was in the mid 80\u2019s, which is hot for Tahoe, but there was blue sky and no smoke. We are still dealing with smokey haze here in Lincoln, although it isn\u2019t nearly as bad as it has been.  It should be clear by midweek according to the weather folk. I hit some balls at the golf course. Putting, chipping (if you can call what I did chipping ugh), and I even hit some balls at the driving range. I think I can go back to my instructor now. WhooHoo. Other than that, we cooked dinner in each night. I cooked one meal: poached salmon and butternut squash. My friend made chicken in marinara sauce, ravioli, and salad.  OK, funny story. We were attempting to open a bottle of Viognier when the wine opener broke inside the cork leaving the screw part sticking out of the cork. We couldn't budge the cork, so went to Raleys to get a new wine opener and a wrench to pry the old cork out...HaHa not happening. So, we gave up on that and opened a different bottle. My friend will have her son work on that bottle for her later. HOA vs our Fence update. The committee still does not agree. They want us to replace the fence with the original fencing and design. We\u2019ll be attending the next meeting August 12th to discuss with them what exactly they are objecting to other than the materials we used\u2026we used two of the OK\u2019d three materials and the guidelines say only one can be used. Greg thinks they are pissed that we didn\u2019t get their blessing from the start. We submitted our plans, Greg went to the meeting, and all they said was they wanted more details whatever that means. We did not provide them with more details as most everyone on our street did their work, took pics, then submitted plans.  During the meeting, there was NO mention of anything in the plans being out of compliance at that point. Wouldn\u2019t that have been a good time to say, \u2018we notice your fence plan is made of two materials instead of one, and that can\u2019t be done\u2019?  So, we\u2019ll go to the meeting and see what we can do to soothe their ruffled feathers. I\u2019ve read all the posts, but am getting ready to spend the day with my honey, so don\u2019t have time to do shout outs. Have a great Saturday.  SIS Kimberly ",

Tonight, it's homemade spinach and cheese ravioli from a great little deli that I'll make the sauce for - garlic, basil from the garden, tomatoes from the garden, squash from the garden, and olive oil.  I may warm up the left over braised pork from Greg's fab meal Sat. night to put along side the ravioli.  I am so proud of you!  That takes a lot of courage to stick it out in such an uncomfortable situation, and I'm so pleased you've told/are going to tell this guy you aren't interested in dating a drunk. You so deserve better than that, and you can just take your pretty young-looking auburn haired self right into a much better situation. I know that you are disappointed in him and in yourself for allowing him into your home, but that was a lesson learned, right?  I personally would not want him at the wedding even as friends if he's just going to get drunk to get himself through the event.  You don't need to be worrying about what he's doing when you should be enjoying your daughter's wedding. Just my opinion. There is nothing wrong with working part time at KMart as a cashier. I know you hoped for more, but if this is all you can find right now, then so be it. Just be the very best cashier you can be and before you know it, you'll be promoted to full-time and moving up in the company. If another job comes along, then that will just be icing won't it?  Have a great first day of work tomorrow, Kimberly  PS Kathy, I didn't even see we were on page 117, I just read 116. So, the beach is treating you well eh?  That would be awesome for you and D1 to meet. Is Paula somewhere close as well? Hope the kids are just loving their time on the water with friends and family...fishing, swimming, and playing. These are memories they will not forget. Wouldn't it be great if they brought their families to this same place?",

'Ditto\" on saying \"Thanks D1 for bringing us all together.\" My portectomy went well.  Got in three hours later than my scheduled time, but the peron in front of me was \" a mess\" once my surgeon  got inside.  I wasn't impatient or anything as I knew that if I needed the extra time to do the best job possible, that she would have done so for me, too. So, the last chapter in the treatment part of this journey was yesterday, and am ready to get my next chapter started. How appropriate that it would begin on Thanksgiving. I see my oncologist on the 8th, so I'm doing bloodwork on the 1st.  I will be celebrating my Cancerversay on the 6th, so when I see him next, it will be with a milestone having been reached. Oh Yeah!!!! Carol - No need to keep your enthusiasm at bay...live life to its fullest!!!  Dance around and smile and share the joy!!!  You said it yourself, there's no rewind, pause, or fast forward button on life...all we have is now. Kris - That is such great news that you're doctor's agree with you about getting that other breast taken care of, so you won't have to be playing the whatif game everytime you have a mammo. The good news is that at least you will have enjoyed your Thanksgiving meal before have to drink that OH So Yummy drink.  Keep us posted on the results of the PET. Hey, Paula, good to hear from you today.  Fingers and toes are crossed for Ed's new medical trial and for a clear mammogram next week. Joan - Lucy is the cutest little thing. I'll bet she's grown a bit since you first got her.  Yeah on a week off from school.  I don't know about you,but teaching is exhausting both physically and emotionally for me.  I'm on my feet all day as I'm sure you are, too, and feel like I'm part actress as I'm always 'on' , even when I don't have the energy to do so.   Enjoy your break...rej-energize your batteries.  I know I am. Happy Turkey Day to you all. I check in tomorrow. SIS Kimberly  CHJ - I love your new avatar...your hair looks great! ",

      "Content": "May 3, 2008 01:38PM - edited May 3, 2008 01:43PM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, It is a spectacular Sat. morning here in Lincoln. The sun is shining, and it should get into the upper 70\u2019s or low 80\u2019s today. Let\u2026the sunshine\u2026  Let\u2026the sunshine\u2026Let the sunshine in!!! (Remember, the 5th Demension?). So, I went for a walk yesterday along the wetlands path near my house and was privileged to see a Canadian Geese pair with their three little yellow babies. One parent was in front, and then the three little ones, and finally the other parent followed behind them. It was sooo precious. I didn\u2019t make a full mile, but almost. .86 miles.  I\u2019ve got a pedometer.  I think I\u2019ll be ready for May 10th\u2019s Susan G. Komen\u2019s Race for the Cure 1k walk.  Don\u2019t think I could walk 5 miles yet. My sister has a colleague at work who walks every year and has a team, so we joined her team. Therese- OK, 9 weeks out is my birthday. That would be a welcomed gift. Sherry- Glad the storms have not been awful in your area and will hop onto your good wishes train for all of those gals living in areas that have been or will soon be affected by this weird weather. D1- That is fantastic news!!!!  I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019ll be done in time for Mom\u2019s Day.  I\u2019m sure that there is a study somewhere that will support your approach and the cause and effect relationship of letting those who take care of you know they are appreciated and having a positive effect on their attitude towards you.  GOOD NEWS!!!!!  Frankenboob is taking one for Mom\u2019s Day. Man, your tanning field is big. How long will it take for the skin to heal once you\u2019re totally done?  Gotta be in good form for the sister getaway.  As far as missing the Rehoboth trip, who says you can\u2019t take a solo trip? I\u2019ve heard traveling solo is a great time of reflection and relaxation. Just a thought. Enjoy watching the dd play today after your LAST tanning session. Carol- LOL on taking offense to the cocktail hour comment by D1. Mixing a little cranberry juice into your water. Hahaha.  Yep, missing those taste buds. There will be margaritas tonight at twinsis\u2019 house, but alas, I will not be partaking. Sigh. Hope the pork chops and broccolini settled well on the tummy, and that the whole tummy se just bypasses you all together this time around. I decided to take the boneless, skinless organic chicken thighs and stuff them with lowfat ricotta mixed with fresh basil, Italian herbs,and fresh spinach I sautéed in olive oil and garlic. I seared each side of the four chicken thighs, then placed two in a glass dish with olive oil. Then placed some of the ricotta mix on top and then put the second chicken thigh on top of that. Over the two stuffed chicken thighs, I poured two cans of organic Italian diced tomatoes and baked at 350 degrees. I made a little whole grain angel hair pasta to place the tomatoes over as a side dish. It turned out great considering I just made it up off the top of my head based on what was in the fridge. You\u2019re welcome for taking on the Secret Pal thing. Like we talked about yesterday, it will be one way to stay connected in a more personal way. Kathy- Wow, and a new chapter begins on Monday. How exciting. We\u2019ll miss hearing from you daily, but certainly do understand that life is going to be a lot busier for you. Thank you so much for being our schedule-posting agent. That has really helped a lot. I look forward to seeing DONE after everyone\u2019s tx regime. Tina- I\u2019m so excited for you to be almost done!!!!  Just a few weeks of \u2018expansion\u2019 time before the exchange, and you\u2019re finito.  Who did your port removal? Your plastic surgeon or your breast surgeon? LOL on the Christmas port ornament. Give your coworker a big hey from all of us. Let her know we are sending her our very best. Deb- So glad to hear all is well in your neck of the woods. I love Moonlight!  And, how cool that your dd is a black belt, and wanting to continue her training.  I don\u2019t think she\u2019s got to worry about being beat upon at this stage of the game by 99% of people, and I\u2019ll be she can hold her own with that other 1%. Diana63- Only 4 more to go. WhooHoo. The light is at the end of your tunnel.  I have to say,thankfully, I didn\u2019t have the severe swelling issues or soreness with the Taxotere in my cocktail that some of you have experienced with taxane (sp) based chemo. I can\u2019t even imagine what that must be like. Hope your se\u2019s are light after this last tx. OK, so I\u2019m caught up for now. Have a great Saturday ladies. SIS Kimberly PS-Julie, you must have been composing at the same time. Whoohoo on getting in sooner than later. Good luck getting all the requisitions done. ",

      "Content": "May 4, 2008 02:31PM - edited May 4, 2008 02:47PM by SISKimberly Happy Sunny Sunday Morning, For those not experiencing a sunny Sunday, I\u2019m just appalled at Ms. Nature\u2019s favoring certain parts of the country over other parts.  Do you suppose she\u2019s in menopause?  You think it might be like experiencing hot flashes on the west coast and trying to cool herself off in the Northeast?  Showing her moody side with heavy rain and high winds elsewhere? So, I\u2019ve been thinking about how I might describe how I\u2019ve been feeling this past couple of days.  You know that feeling of anticipation you had when you woke up too early on Christmas morning and had to fight the urge to get out of bed knowing your parents had expressly forbidden you to rise before the sun?  You know how you eventually lost the battle with that urge and snuck quiet as a mouse down the hallway holding your breath as if your parents might hear your breathing as plain as if you were in the same room as they were?  You know how you prayed the dog wouldn\u2019t wake and give you away, or that your siblings might, so they could join you and split the trouble you just might be in if you got caught?  That is how I feel.  Full of anticipation and a little dread, but not full on fear-like dread, because I know that like my parents, who would not have really punished me for getting up to early, only quietly shushed me as I tore into my Christmas stocking and played with my Santa present, my nagging feeling doesn\u2019t have much bite.  It\u2019s just a little thought in the back of mind reminding me that I\u2019ve got to create a whole new normal, and not knowing what that new normal really is, yet.  I know it will take time to fully develop, but in the mean time, it nags at me to get a move on.  Thankfully, the anticipation of my ever growing energy keeps me focused as I creep down the hall, holding my breath, looking towards what might be in my Christmas stocking and to what Santa has left me under the tree.  Can anyone else relate? Twinsis\u2019 Cinco Di Mayo (sp?) party was a success.  I was soooo bummed I could not taste anything except the corn tortilla chips. Flavor just isn\u2019t on my tongue's radar these days. Texture is either pleasing or it isn\u2019t, but flavor is either not there or horrible.  Oh well, it was so good to see her closest coworkers gathered together to wish an old friend and his wife bon voyage as they start a-new in Florida. Joan- I am soooo glad you are finally feeling better after your nasty cough.  4 ½ weeks out, congrats. Good luck on Monday with your first tanning session. Just think. You\u2019ll be done by summer and already tan. HeeHee. Carol- I\u2019ve never heard of a teen facial. That\u2019s awesome, and I hope your ds uses his expensive new products as instructed and sees wonderful results.  I know acne can be difficult for teens. Rain? Bummer. Hopefully, you\u2019re out right now walking and having a great time with Ginny and the gang in warmer weather. WhooHoo on a cooperative tummy! No walk today, just chores around the house and grocery shopping. LOL on the brain fart. I can relate. As I typed this, I could not recall what to call corn tortilla chips. Had to ask the dh, \u201cWhat are those things called that you dip into salsa?\u201d  Crazy. Tina- Wasn\u2019t that just the saddest thing?  I hate that these horses are raced at such young ages before their bones have really had a chance to mature. I felt so badly for her and her jockey. No drains?  My ps told me I\u2019d have drains, just not for the same length of time as after the mast.  Hmmmm. Good luck with all the planting. I\u2019m not much of a gardener. I  like to see it when it\u2019s all done and harvest the gifts, but planting and caring for a garden is my dh\u2019s dept. Just read your post. Yeah on a sunny Sunday in your neck of the woods. Your plantings should be happy to be placed in the ground. Gotta love a dh who will spend time blinging his love\u2019s bike. Sherry- I\u2019m not doing the 3 Day 60 mile one, I\u2019m doing the 1 mile one. This is the one day event where you can do 5 miles or 1 mile. No way I could do 60 miles right now, either. Take care of that ppb(poor pink boob). Paula- WhooHoo, on completing the 5k walk and doing it topless.  That\u2019s my plan,too. I\u2019m with you on being bald cooling you off quickly.  I had to take my cap off last night before Kath\u2019s guests arrived as I was getting too warm. No one seemed to mind my baldness at all. Oh, the prom!!!!  I, too, recall it being held in the gym until about 1978, and then our highschool in Truckee started renting out large event spaces at local resorts. Our middle school dealt with that commercial hype at the Valentines Day dance. Kids acted like it was a prom of sorts, and it was just ridiculous.  We decided to do away with that behavior.  We also now do a promotion ceremony during the day with a BBQ for our 8th graders, instead of a full blown graduation, after several years of evening graduations just getting out of control. Kids wearing inappropriate clothing, and parents totally inconsiderate of others with whooping and hollering after being instructed to hold all applause until the whole row had been given their diploma so as to make sure all of our kids felt special (some didn\u2019t have much family to make noise for them). They brought noise makers and silly string even though the letter that went home stated clearly not to bring those items. They ignored signs and roped off areas, and some displayed tempers when told they couldn\u2019t be in certain areas taking pics.  No wonder some of our kids behave as they do, the apple apparently doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree. We know that sadly, some of it was probably the only graduation some of these kids would have, but it was becoming a safety concern. We thought, what will these kids have to look forward to if they\u2019ve already done the big \u2018prom\u2019 like dance and the big \u2018graduation\u2019 ceremony?  It has worked out great the past two years without these two events done as they once were, and no one seems to miss them. Glad you finished your day early and hope you slept well last night. Looking forward to the link to your interview. Oh, just read your Sunday post. Glad you slept well and thanks for the link to your 5k. You looked great, and your mom looks so young. Your rads field covers both sides of the chest, eh? So, you\u2019ll be our ppbs (poor pink boobs gal). CathyCA- Welcome home, and yeah that Dad is doing so well. What a scary time for you and your family. Your vacation sounds like just what you and the dh needed, and WOW on the autographed drum-sticks at the Springsteen concert!!!!! Love that pic, and what a handsome dh you\u2019ve got to with your hot in your blue scarf self, Cathy. So, Tuesday is your last chemotini, eh?  Congrats!!!! What\u2019s next for you?  Will you do rads? Have a wonderful Sunday, all. I have a concert tonight, Michael Buble. That should be fun. SIS Kimberly To those who haven't posted in awhile, we're thinking about ya. Kathy- You must have posted when I did. You sound like you had a great Saturday with the dd.  Glad you're feeling good, except for the one bum ear, and am wishing you the very best on your first day back to work tomorrow.  PALady- You snuck up on me, too.  Yeah for being done Wed. and for no appts. for a few weeks.   I like your insight for Julie about the ds's comments on the hair.  Being a tween is tough enough without having to deal with your mom 'standing out in a crowd'.  Hopefully, having gone through this with you moms, the kids will eventually see the lessons they were offered along the way and appreciate them more than they can articulate at this moment.",

WhooHoo!  Hope I can get it scheduled between my summer \u2018cation plans.  Arizona in May, Chicago in June, and Ashland in July\u2026all end of the month \u2018cations. The recovery is two to three weeks, so I think I\u2019ll be good to go if I do this when we get back from Arizona. Carol- I don\u2019t have the emotional PMS thing, so I can\u2019t really say, \u201cI know what you\u2019re going through,\u201d but I have had moments where my emotions got in the way of communicating effectively with the man in my life when Jon was younger. The good news is that you recognized that you were PMSing and that in the grand scheme this is not really a big deal.  (((((HUGS)))) to keep on tap in case you need another when the dh is unavailable. A 2.9 is so close.  I agree with Julie that the ds has been through a lot with your bc, but his last set of grades were right in the thick of bc too, weren\u2019t they? The ex probably feels the ds is capable even in the face of adversity, not that this thought is realistic as the ds\u2019 emotions have probably been a roller coaster. Does ds know what his grades are at this moment?  Can he pull a 3.0 this June?  I agree with Paula and D1. Put your thoughts together and talk with the ex again. If he agrees after you plead your case, then great. If not, I understand your wanting ds to have his license, and he still can if his grades are good enough this June, but if he knew that was the deal, then he\u2019s got to live by those boundaries. I imagine that the good driver\u2019s discount was why the 3.0 became the goal.  If he doesn\u2019t make it, it will be a bummer, but he\u2019ll get over it.  Getting a job for the summer will have to be within biking distance or within range of public transportation, maybe? I was sorry to hear Steph wasn\u2019t feeling all that great, but glad he was feeling well enough to go to work. I can\u2019t even imagine three days of chemo in a row.  He\u2019s my Hero!!!! Central Market sounds like our Whole Foods store. I won\u2019t buy farmed fish, only wild as it tastes so much better. I\u2019m thinking I need to make a Whole Foods run on my way home from the ps to pick up some dinner stuff for the rest of the week.  My sisters will be spending the night with us on Friday, so we can all get up and go to the Susan G. Komen race for the cure together. I will be wearing my Check Your Boobies hat! I\u2019ll be thinking of you as you drink down #10. How great to have a family friend to do those things for you that your mom would do.  We have a family friend like that. If she lived closer, she so would have been helping to take care of me. She helped to care for my mom before she died. They invited my parents to move in and stay with them so they could help my dad out. When mom died, they told dad he could stay for as long as he needed to do so.  Love them. Those kinds of friends are such a blessing in our lives, aren\u2019t they? Speaking of DWTS, don\u2019t tell me the results. I DVR\u2019d it. But, Monday\u2019s show was pretty darn good. I was shocked and pleased that Cristian did so well. Julie- WOW, the National Board Certification is a huge deal!!!!!!  Congratulations.  I don\u2019t even have the energy to even think about let alone go through all of that. Glad you\u2019re feeling better and that you were able to tackle some of that paperwork. Looks like I\u2019ll be co-chairing the Language Arts dept. next year. The boss knew I\u2019d need a year to just get my strength back and asked if I\u2019d want to co-chair. It also looks like I\u2019ll be in the LA dept. and the Electives dept. next year teaching two classes of Study Skills and three 7th grade LA classes.  Looks like I\u2019ll have 7th grade LA, Study Skills, Prep, Study Skills, Lunch, and then two 7th grade LA classes. I pretty much didn\u2019t get anything I requested, but since I\u2019m not sweating the small stuff anymore, I\u2019m just going with the flow.  I\u2019m SuperGirl, I can do anything that needs to be done!!!! I have light peach fuzz on my head that is only visible in the mirror if I have a light behind my head- very halo like. HaHaHa.  I remember when D1 described this peach fuzz phase.  My scalp doesn\u2019t hurt, however. Paula- Bummer about the tape burns. I know what that is like. As D1 and PAlady have said, keep the boob lubed and use those pads Kathy suggested to help keep things cool and moisturized.  What a devastating loss for the ds\u2019s team. At least the ds had some good play, and hopefully the team will take this defeat as an opportunity to see where they need to improve as a team, and moves on to do well in the next game. My son played t-ball then decided team sports wasn\u2019t his thing. He couldn\u2019t handle other kids not doing what they should be doing- very OCD. He got involved in track for a season, then Aikido, then roller hockey for fun in Jr. High and high school, and then electric keyboard\u2026I think you get the picture.  I got to be a team mom for one season, and that was the extent of my son\u2019s sports involvement. Tina- Good for you getting back to work, yesty.  I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve got three months to just recoup before getting back into the classroom. 150+ kids can wear you down when you\u2019re 100%, so I can\u2019t even imagine going back now.  My whole way of doing my morning is going to change when I go back to work. I like being on the \u2018puter in my jammies at 9 and 10am, then thinking about taking a walk, and then showering and doing something productive. D1- OK, I\u2019ve heard of loving our pets like our kids, but I have never heard of a puppy party with Frosty Paws (like ice cream?) being served to the guests. LOL Hope Kippy enjoys himself. Will the human guests be indulging in festive libations? LJ13- Sounds like you've got your game plan for the next few months outlined. Onco nurses do rock.  Kathy- Hope today isn\u2019t so brain draining. Wendy and CHJ, thinking of you both along with Carol today. WhooHoo, CHJ on finishing your last round. SIS Kimberly  ",

She\u2019s been overwhelmed with bc txs and se\u2019s, losing her job in March, and the fears of financially not being able to keep up on bills and her insurance. Lots on her plate. The good news is she just accepted a job offer. She wants me to extend her best wishes to all of you and to apologize for being MIA, which I told her not even to worry about as we certainly understand.  She\u2019ll try to check in when she\u2019s able to manage it. Hey Joan- Glad to hear your rads is going well so far and that the onc was able to give you a cream to lube the boob that will give you more relief that Aquafore. Score on the gym membership!!! Tina- Technical course, eh?  Sounds too much for my brain at this moment. Seeing as you are transitioning from working at home, can you wear jammies and fuzzy slippers to training, or do you suppose they\u2019d frown upon that? Snow until the end of May?  I have been sheltered! I thought living in Lake Tahoe during my 6th-12th grades was experiencing a \u2018real\u2019 winter. Guess not. Carol-  Speaking of \u2018real\u2019, WhooHoo to the ds on his first real job, not that mowing lawns and stuff isn\u2019t a real job. The Viking Festival. That sounds interesting. My family\u2019s origins show that we were Vikings who settled in Normandy, and then moved into Scotland. I agree that a second opinion is never unwise (Oooh, a double negative. Shame on me). My onc told me I certainly could get a second opinion, but that she knew they\u2019d tell me the same thing she did. I respect her honesty, but will check with my surgeon as I said earlier just to double check. Hope you got some much needed sleep, my friend. Paula- With all that you\u2019re doing, just finishing chemo, and now doing rads, no wonder you\u2019re in sleep mode. Glad you got to take a little time this morning.  Hope your company picnic goes well and that your McDonalds fundraiser gets you to your goal when added to private donations coming in. Thanks for your support regarding rads.  It is such a crap shoot, isn\u2019t it?  I just have to believe that asking lots of questions and getting lots of information is all I can do to feel confident in my decision in the end. Julie- Thinking about you and hoping the new foobies are not causing you too much discomfort. I have to drop my \u2018stang off today at the dealer. The damper that should switch from defrost mode to vent mode isn\u2019t working, so air conditioning only comes out of the defrost vents at the windshield and some air on the floor, but nothing out of the vents.  Not going to work in the 100 degree weather we are going to experience over the next 4 days. Have a good day ladies. I\u2019ll check in later. SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Jan 10, 2009 04:59PM - edited Jan 10, 2009 05:01PM by SISKimberly Good afternoon Jewels, I apologise upfront for the novel. It was tough getting back into the school groove after being gone for two weeks, for teachers and kids alike. Came home yesterday with a fever, achy, stuffy head, and sore throat\u2026geez didn\u2019t I just do this at Christmas?  Guess this is the cousin virus\u2026got a good recommendation about partying at Kimberly\u2019s being oh so fun.  So, while Greg is in Lassen taking care of reading weather monitors for renewable energy research, I\u2019m home in my jammies, doing domestic chores, and grading Story Analysis projects. Saw a great musical review last Saturday night called Forever Plaid about a Doo-Wop group (male) who were killed in a car crash before their big break, and we are their chance to perform their big show before \u2018crossing over\u2019. Great fun, and the venue is wonderful.  The Cosmopolitan Club. They have a bar and restaurant, plus a little performance venue that seats about 100. There are small round cocktail tables that seat four in the front section about three rows of tables, and raised seating behind. Carol, your dinner sound delish\u2026a massage before hand, too. Nice!  At least the dh was in his own home having his  libations. Doesn\u2019t it feel good to have all the Christmas stuff put away, and a fresh start for the new year? Way to go Santa!!!!  \u201cPardon me, while I head to the laundry room for a bottle of wine.\u201d  HeeHee  I totally understand the loud fan as our previous coolers were louder than the cellar we have now, which is so quiet.  As long as the laundry doesn\u2019t get heated  with the dryer making the cooler have to work harder to keep the wine chilled, you\u2019re good to go. Glad you enjoyed the New Years letter, didn\u2019t do one last year, the Devine 2009 poem, and the New Years link.  It was such a blast being in the city. Carol, 2am?, and you thought you\u2019d be in bed after the New York New Year at 9pm. You must have been having a great time. And fireworks in the snow\u2026that must have beautiful. Achy joints don\u2019t sound like fun. Wonder what is up with that?  At least the hips and knees aren\u2019t involved. Of course, I feel the same way when I get up these days\u2026your feet comment. I seem to recall you and I hobbling up from our seats this summer after along sit down and discussion to get more wine. It\u2019s almost like you have to warm them up. I exercised three days last week with some teachers in my room. We just move the desks, and choose a video and do a workout together. We did yoga on Tuesday, Dance it Off on Wednesday (imagine me trying to do Hip Hop and Latin\u2026to think I used to be a dancer. My body so did not remember that part of my life. I used to dance 4 hours a day in college\u2026sigh\u2026) We liked the ballet part of that workout and the cool down part. Thursday we did Cardio Pilates. We all really liked that one. so, I\u2019m off to a good start on my resolution to work out at least three times a week. My walking partner during my prep period is training a new teacher, so we\u2019re taking a break for a few weeks. I\u2019m thinking we need to say mid-July in Vegas\u2026even though it will be really hot, there are more indoor walking areas from place to place, and we can walk the strip in the evenings when it\u2019s cooler. Lots to their\u2026spa, gamble, see a show, shop, eat good food, etc\u2026and it\u2019s their low season, so not as expensive. Man, you guys are getting pounded with the snow. We\u2019re not having so much this year. We\u2019re hoping for more, but it just doesn\u2019t look good right now. Another drought year for us it seems. Glad to hear you\u2019re emailing Steph, and that he\u2019s in good spirits. Let him know that I\u2019m sending him my best and a hug. Jules \u2013 Your remodeling sounds like it\u2019s in full swing. Can\u2019t wait for the before and after pics. Interesting that the dealer just accepted that the car he inherited was in good condition\u2026with only 45 miles on it, who would blame him. Did it fall off the travel trailer when it was being delivered or did someone at the old dealership drive it during that 45 miles and get into an accident? You\u2019ld think that would haved been disclosed. Well, the good news is that your dealer took good care of you. Glad the nips are doing well and that you are pleased with the results.  I\u2019m not sure I want to do that. The skin is so thin on the left, I\u2019d be afraid of an accidental puncture to the implant.  I thought about doing a 3-D tattoo so it just looks like I have nipples and areolas, but that whole needle thing makes me nervous. Vettagal/Vettaguy \u2013 Wish I could see your picture better, it\u2019s so small, but you look happy, and your post sounded much more upbeat.  Glad to hear your Whole Foods is full of gluten free items. Sometimes I wonder if my poor gut just hasn\u2019t fully healed or something.  I notice that after eating, I get this \u2018rock in the gut feeling\u2019. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time, but enough to notice it, and I haven\u2019t really charted what is making me feel that way. I know when I eat too much \u2013 a whole sandwich instead of a half, for example \u2013 does it to me, and foods that have too much fat \u2013 cheese or deep fried things. Hmmm, I\u2019ll have to pay more attention. Anyway, enjoy your games\u2026Pittsburg plays this weekend, right? Nice\u2026a free trip and being pampered to boot? You deserved it!!!! So, what\u2019s the funny plane story?  To heck with the plane story the basement story was awesome!!! LOL Hey, Vettaguy, got a side business going that we didn\u2019t know about? Sorry to hear about vettesis. You know, sometimes the petty family shit just becomes the excuse for not dealing with the real issues, and it doesn\u2019t sound like the family is ready yet, and that\u2019s OK. It is just the way it is right now. Your family has been through a lot in the past year or so. You are right to just take a time out from all of that and take care of yourself. The poem originally came from Leo Sayer\u2019s novel, I Am Third.  I have that in my classroom without the reference to God, as that would be challenged. I use it to remind my students of the time they are wasting on things that will not make their tomorrow better for them. Yeah, like they listen. Anything beyond lunch is so not on their radar, but one can hope that it will sink in eventually, and some kid in his/her adult years will say, \u201c I had this teacher once you said\u2026\u201d Tina \u2013 Nice bargain hunting by the dh!!!!  I lived in Tahoe, and I don\u2019t ski. I tried, but it was pretty funny and scary. I tried cross-country, too. I\u2019m just such a dork. I\u2019m more of a sit in the lodge with a good book and a hot adult beverage by the fire girl. Wow, your house sounds like it is in the perfect location. Who wouldn\u2019t want to live there? I tried the link, but it said Photo album not available. I love having fun concerts and events to look forward to\u2026how fun to anticipate seeing your favorite band and your all-time favorite band.  Loved Forever Plaid!!!! I started typing this morning, and will have to change it to afternoon as well. It takes a while to catch up when you\u2019re only on once a week. Hey, a showing already. WhooHoo!!! And, I am impressed you used a Q-tip on your stove top!!! D1 would be proud. WhooHoo, welcome to the menopause side of town!!! Yep, I heard that even with an Ooph that AI\u2019s are recommended. Glad to hear your friend is doing so well. Joan \u2013 So, did you survive the first week back after \u2018cation?  Our Special Ed dept. is busy doing mid-year IEPs and testing as well. Soooo much paper work.   You\u2019re welcome for the card. Kathy \u2013 I haven\u2019t used my Wii Fit in awhile. I liked it at first, but the constant stopping to change exercises bugged me. The Jillian\u2019s fitness for Wii is supposed to eliminate that issue. My son\u2019s gf got it and loves it. I\u2019ll be going out to get that myself, so I can do that on the weekends. Sherry \u2013 I know that it may not seem like it now, but I truly do believe that everything happens for a reason. You will find the perfect job for you\u2026right now, you need to take care of yourself and get healthy.  Are you able to collect unemployment?  Look into getting retrained at the local Community College? You could get financial aid via grants ,I\u2019ll bet. You might also quality under the Person\u2019s with Disabilities act being a breast cancer survivor if you\u2019re having in lingering effects that prevent you from working certain types of jobs.  The medical field and education are the only areas where layoffs rarely occur. Getting your medical assistant certificate or dental assistant, or medical billing/transcription, or becoming a Teacher\u2019s Aid might be an option. Sometimes the things that seem to be the worst, actually end up being the greatest gifts. 2009 isn\u2019t staring off badly, it\u2019s starting off offering you opportunities. Love your Kitty avatar. Hey, you need to tell your doc about the depression and all. That\u2019s a must. There is no reason to be suffering with depression, and no one is going to send you to the looney bin. CHJ- The Baltimore Ravens?  Football?  Sorry to say, I\u2019ve not heard of that team. Hope your had a fabulous New Year. I\u2019m with you on the pink Dyson. I saw a bunch of kitchen equipment in pink\u2026blender, mixer, toaster, etc\u2026no thank you. I\u2019m a stainless steel girl. Paula \u2013 So, did you make it through the first week back after \u2018cation? I\u2019m exhausted. The good news about wearing a uniform or scrubs\u2026no wardrobe decisions! I love Fridays, as I can wear Buljan wear. Sweat pants and a Buljan shirt. So, comfy. Hope Ed is doing better now that he\u2019s had some time to recoup after round #2. Glad you enjoyed my letter and shared my poem with your work friends. That makes me smile to think my words are being passed around. Cracked me up when you described you poor \u2018puter giving up its last pixel. LOL. You\u2019ll love the Mac laptop. I love my G4. I\u2019ve had it for at least four or five years now. OMG, I am rolling reading your dream\u2026 Hmmm, let\u2019s see. Taxi\u2026you\u2019re always driving everyone around to appointments, conferences, colleges, etc\u2026 dh splitting firewood, your desire for him to get back to feeling healthy and strong again.   Size 4 prom dress had me doubled over\u2026glad you chose the jeans and sleeveless top\u2026as this shows you know you don\u2019t need to impress us, just be yourself. Lifting those trees like they were twigs\u2026HELLO\u2026you are our SHERO, of course you have super human strength!!! The car thing is Julie\u2019s car story and Carol\u2019s car story\u2026as both mentioned car crashes and Carol mentioned sand and four wheeling, I believe.  As far as the car rolling as she jumped out to say, hi, I can see Carol being so excited to meet you that she\u2019d forget to put the car in Park\u2026LOL. The filling up and not knowing where to go ect\u2026sounds like a little anxiety about what\u2019s ahead, and how the constant of school\u2026student being in the car\u2026is an equalizer for you. Hey, that sounds pretty darn good. Maybe I missed my calling. LOL. Oh Paula, I can understand your being hesitant to bring in hospice, as who wants to admit that everything that can be done has been done, and it may not be working.  I am so sorry to hear of Ed\u2019s deterioration. If there is anything we can do for you, please do not hesitate. I hope the Decadron helps the swelling if that\u2019s what is going on. The Twin Heart wheat weaving you gave me has been super glued to the frame of the picture of Kath and I as newborns. It looks great. CRAP\u2026just read of the MRI report. I am so sorry this new regime isn\u2019t doing the trick. FUBC doesn\u2019t even express it. ((((HUGS)))) D1- FUSE\u2026Hope the Wellbutrin works for you. I took that for a short stint after my mom died. Night sweats and dry mouth were no fun, and my sex drive went into the toilet. I was in my 30\u2019s, so not a desirable effect. Switched to something else, can\u2019t recall. Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have a bad time of it, though. Good luck with that. How exciting to be in a place you can see the swearing in festivities from. Not sure I would want to venture out into the throngs myself. So I assume the office has a bathroom with a shower and all? I recall there\u2019s a gym there. You\u2019ve got a little over a week to decide on what to wear. Maybe Paula\u2019s dd will loan you her prom dress. LOL Maz- Fingers and toes are crossed that it is only a thickening of the tissue\u2026not the news you wanted to hear, I\u2019m sure.  Keep us posted.  And how nice that your primary care doc took the time to say hello. LJ13- Good advice for D1 and all the ladies on Tamox regarding antidepressants. I do recall reading that when I was doing all of my research about the drug. Therese \u2013 Good to hear from you as always. Another Jewel taking the 3 Day plunge. Bravo. I wish I lived closer to someone who was doing it, as I might consider it, but the whole tent thing still has me thinking not. Norma \u2013 You\u2019re welcome for the card and letter. Natural supplements to cut the estrogen? I\u2019ve not heard of any, but haven\u2019t done any major research either. Are you aware of anything? Once I get my next blood test showing I\u2019m in true Post Menopause \u2013that is two weeks \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll look into that as I don\u2019t want to take an AI either. Ummm, 193 page Senior project? What teacher is going to read and grade that? Is there an interview/presentation portion, too?  A few friends have HS kids and have talked about the Senior Project. Man, he must have been relieved to get that done. Keep us posted on what the onc and obgyn have to say. Glad there are no blood clots. Speaking of blood clots, we had our SDC teacher collapse in class. Mini stroke. Thank goodness her aide was there and that her kids \u2013 all with severe physical, emotional, and/or learning issues of some kind \u2013 followed the aides instructions to run to the office for help. She\u2019s fine, but will take a Baby aspirin daily from now on. She\u2019s had blood pressure issues, which usually means cholesterol issues, I\u2019m guessing. She eats really well and is thin, so no one would have ever expected this, most of all, her. OK, this is a novel. Sorry, but with all the chatting going on during the week, I\u2019ve got to catch up. I started at 10am and it is now 2pm\u2026.Geez\u2026I\u2019ve got to find a way to check in during the week,too.  \u2013SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Dec 31, 2007 09:00AM - edited Dec 31, 2007 09:04AM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, Again, I am amazed at all that's been posted since yesterday... KathyL and SheShe48-Shocking that a pediatrics office-an office that deals with medicine- can be so discompassionate to one of its own nurses. SheShe48-same to you...a BC Survivor fired you? I don't think that's even legal...firing someone on the spot for disclosing they were diagnosed with cancer. (Not that I'm advocating filing a wrongful termination suit- who would want to work for someone like that anyway). I feel for you both on the tightening finances. I am sooooo lucky to work in my school district. We have a Catestrophic Leave bank that we donate to each year. I applied to be granted enough leave to get me through the end of the school year. I am awarded 20 days at a time, and have been told there is enough to get me to the end of the year plus plenty of days for others in our district who may need it. Once that is done, if I need more time, my disability insurance will kick in at 75% of my pay. Kathy, I hear you about all the germs and being on your feet all day long. As a teacher, I'm in the same boat. Parents send their sick ones to school all the time, and I often don't get to sit all day long- except during my 36 minute lunch, if I take lunch as I often give up lunch to assist kids who need help- having 5 periods and over 130+ students in and out of the classroom. I had to take the rest of the year off...and it killed me...I miss my kids so much...but I had to put my well-being first. D1-Not only is FUBC totally appropriate....but FUSE (F..U...Side..Effects) too!!!! You crack me up...even when you're feeling like the Vikings snapped you the ball and let the other team trample all over you. I often say to the TV...like it can hear me...when pharmaceutical companies advertise their wares...\"How can you put on that smile and do whatever it is you're doing with all those SE's?\" Notice the SE's are stated quickly in the background like we won't notice. Who can function at all, let alone have sex, with a four hour erection, loss of hearing, and eyesight? And those SE's for the CMF chemotini sound dreadful...of course, not everyone experiences these SE's...and they have to be disclosed...but that's scary shit...oops, sorry...it just slipped out....must be an SE of BC. Vettegal-I hear you on being impatient...and agree with all the advice/support already given. I had nodes removed on the left side at the same time as my bilat, and healing is slow, but it does get better little by little and day by day. Hang in there...oh, you can't do that yet (neither can I now that I mentioned it)...ummm...Stiff upper lip dahling...you've got the right stuff!!! Love the T-Shirt idea. My DH was in landscaping for over 15 years before he blew his back out. After three surgeries ending in fusion, he had to give it up. He's now an energy analyst at a consulting firm working to get alternative energy plants built-solar, wind, biofuel, geothermal, and hydrogen. Carol- A Tugboater and a Truckdriver? That's great!!!! My father is working with a group to restore an old WWII tugboat from Pearl Harbor. He was in Hawaii when it was bombed-he was 5- and his father was a civil engineer hired by the govt to do things like work on the Panama Canal and stuff. Anyway, my dad feels his father may have been on this tug as he toured the damage and worked on a plan to clear away all the wreckage and repair docks and the like. My mother, who passed away at 58 of Pancreatic Cancer, was a wonderfully funny lady. She often stated that when she retired she wanted to be a poet truckdriver. Hee Hee. Sorry to hear your mom passed of melonoma. Anyway, I'm with you on making 2008 the year I show the world what this gal is made of...let's kick butt this year!!!!! Sharon-Thanks for the info on Neupogen and Nuelasta. I know I'm supposed to get a shot of something the next day after chemo...but can't recall the name of it. Still haven't heard from my oncologists office...I'm thinking they took today off and will do the same tomorrow. Welcome Julie K and Chris. You've found a great group here. Julie, I am 99% positive that I'll be getting a hysterectomy and have my ovaries removed, which is apparently not included in a hysterectomy (uterus only, I believe) in order to reduce my likelihood of ovarian cancer. My dad had breast cancer and prostate cancer(still living), and my mother pancreatic cancer (passed at 58), and all of those cancers are tied to the BRCA2 gene...so Dad's taken the BRCA test as of last week-my insurance won't cover it because we don't have enough cancer in the family line...go figure- If he's positive, then insurance has to cover my test....but more importantly, my twin will have no problems getting her test approved. I already did a bilateral mastectomy-which is one choice my oncologist would have strongly suggested had the test results been in hand prior to surgery...and I'm glad I did have a bilat...the right breast did have precancerous cells roaming around. Now, the test will determine if I have all my female plumbing removed, since my cancer is ERPR+. Sounds like your family history is full of this dreaded disease,too. I'm sorry your family has had to go down this road. Has your sister regretted her decision to remove her breasts and female plumbing? My twin is a bit unnerved by this whole thing...to be expected. I think I've gotten everyone...if not...know I'm thinking about you and wishing you nothing but dreamfilled nights, energy filled days, and clear headed minds :-) By the way, Charlie Wilson's War, was FABULOUS!!!! It's amazing what this man did...and how we find ourselves in the same position again...doing the same thing we've always done only this time without a man like Charlie on the team. When will our gov't learn from its mistakes? I read the Kite Runner, YuYuBear, and hear the movie is really good...but I loved the book so much and don't want to spoil what I imagined in my head...and heard the movie gives too much away too soon. I'll have to wait and see if I can bring myself to go see it. I'm a little weird when it comes to my characters in what I read...I literally have to grieve the end of a book...I can't pick up another for a day or two...OK,that's a lot weird. Happy New Year Jewels...tonight at the stroke of midnight, I'll be toasting us all!!!! Love, your SIS (Sister In Survival) Kimberly",

He went to Zales and bought me a beautiful gold on one side and silver on the other side, flat necklace that lays flat so you can put different jeweled slides on it...and he's having a customed made jeweled slide made for me...it wasn't ready yet, so I don't know what it even looks like...but how perfect to start the January Jewels Journey with my own January Jewel!!!! Carol- I hate it when the computer gremlins play tricks on me and arbitrarily erase everything I'd just typed...oh, they think it's hilarious and often play the same trick several times in a row, which makes me say words I shouldn't and want to throw my laptop. I'm glad to hear you made your CMF decision...that must feel good knowing you have a plan and a direction. Me...still waiting. Certainly, someone has to call me tomorrow!!!! Oh, and thanks for your compliment on the poem I wrote and for the toast...I was drinking a lovely Pinot. SheShe48- Thanks for your thoughts on my Dad...he's fine...hysterical as ever with his \"Cyclops Chest\". And HOORAH for your daughter!!!! Being a teacher can be the most rewarding and the least rewarding profession all at the same time, so many leave after the first five years...I hope your daughter has found her niche and sticks around a very long time...I'm in my 21st year of teaching. AAAHHH!!!! Another negative coffee message...I'm not liking this. I will be drinking as much coffee between now and chemo as I can...I am going to go through withdrawals (but I can just blame it on the chemotini SE's). Iowa Cindy- WOW, what a wonderfully insprirational message. Thank you so much for taking the time to come here and wish us all well and give us encouragement that it can be done. Vettegal- I just cried when you wrote about your DH tearing up and wishing he could take your pain away...what a man you've got there girl!!! OK, so you and me and Arizona Deb...we are going to hear from our doctors tomorrow!!!! Vettegal will find out she has Negative Nodes....and Deb and I will finally know when we get on the chemo train. Arizona Deb- Did you hear? There is negative talk about coffee again. I'm with you...I will be drinking up a coffee storm until I finally get word on when chemo will start for me. Looks like we're in the same boat on the not knowing part. Hope everyone had a wonderful time last night...my DH and I just had a quiet evening at home...listened to music, ate homemade navy bean soup, drank a great Pinot, and watched Big Night with Stanley Tucci and the guy from Monk...something Shaloub. Great flick about two Italian brothers trying to open a restaurant serving authentic Italian food. xoxoxo and HUGS to you all dear sisters. Your SIS(Sister In Survival) Kimberly",

I do not think I should be able to argue with that, for that is true, isn\u2019t it? However, I want to argue! Does that hold true for humans, more specifically for me? If parts are removed, then does it follow, I am not whole? Others have argued the whole is GREATER than the sum of its p a r t s, and as I look at myself\u2026 my physical vessel\u2026 newly battle scarred and looking nothing like its former self did just twenty-eight days ago, I want to kiss whomever said that, for I wholeheartedly agree. Two\u2026 horizontal scars run across each mound of discolored flesh from underarm to sternum. Signs of previous biopsies, and each suture still visible, yet, not there, dissolved, are stretched tightly over expanders, that have yet to reach their potential glory, meant to begin the reconstruction of my formally lethal breasts. Beneath each mound, close to the rib cage, and off slightly to the side, though not exactly in the same spot, (symmetry isn\u2019t the goal) lie small scars still struggling to heal, where long tubes once drained lymph and other fluids needing to escape the trauma. Just above where my right shoulder, if moved forward would crease, is a thin diagonal incision, where a port has been placed, threaded into my blood stream, easily felt round and hard just beneath the skin. A port\u2026 an interesting term, for it denotes safety in a storm, but I fear my storm has yet to begin... its formation is lurking in a ferocious mix of chemicals to be fed into the mouth of this port sending a man-made tornado into my body. No, my body looks nothing like it used to just twenty-eight days ago, and I rejoice in its abtract art-like visage, and in its resilience, for I now see how much GREATER I am than the sum of my parts.

Went to dinner with my dh, my twin, and a good friend from Chico (we danced together-tap, jazz, ballet, ballroom, modern for several years and formed a wonderful bond with our dance group that's lasted over 10 years already). Went to the same restaurant where I had my Bye Bye Boobies Bash. They did a fabulous job with that, and the wait staff recognized me and told the chef I was there. He came out and personally said hello and asked I was doing. Isn't that cool? I just wrote he and his staff a Thank You for their kindness. I had Elk last night.

      "Content": "Jan 6, 2008 05:58PM SISKimberly wrote: Good evening all, It seems pretty clear that birth control pills have greatly increased our chances of getting bc...it increases hormone production which increases the chances of cancer...we were messing with our hormone balances at the urging of our doctors, who didn't know any better at the time, \"the pill is safe, it will make you feel better\"...and it did. I stopped birth control pills 5 years ago after a horrible reaction to a generic version of the name brand birth control pill my HMO decided it would pay for as the brand name wasn't covered anymore. Within two weeks of taking it, I literally was incoherant. If my husband didn't keep pushing my doctor to look at the new pill I'd been given...the only new thing in my world...and discoverd the new pills manufacturer had been cited numerous times and that the machines were cleaned with a compound used in pesticides...I would have been in that state for longer than 3 months. People actually said, \"I'm sorry\" to my husband when he took me to my many specialist appts. I was OK in the morning...but got worse as the day went on...moving was the problem-walking, riding in a car, sitting up for too long-I took all my meds, including the pill for two weeks after symptoms occured, so I had four weeks worth of the poison in me...and then my husband told me and the doctor we were stopping the pill. Thankfully, it was only 12 weeks from start to finish of this horrific experience. I don't remember most of it, but it terrified my family and my poor dh. I was being poisoned. I now have the same reaction to bug spray and other pesticide like things...so I stear clear. I think on top of the hormones I'd been taking since my senior year in high school, pesticides helped propel me towards bc...my dad was sprayed with DDT as a kid...they played in the fog as it was sprayed in neighborhoods not knowing the harmful affects. He had breast cancer and prostate cancer. And...then again it could be genetic...the BRCA results aren't in yet for my dad and twin sister. About the t-shirts: T-shirt slogan: January Jewels...Sisters In Survival... with the breast cancer ribbon of course on the front... and FUBC on the back....on black t-shirts for women-more fitted than the boxy man looking t-shirt- with hot pink ink. I'm tired of all pink...black and pink is more powerful...warrior like colors. CarePress.com takes original designs...which means someone with more talent than I on a computer...can design the shirt and upload the design...and choose the shirt and ink you want. We can all order online from the 'January Jewel's Store' and put the profits towards breastcancer.org's research. Maz, the port is a piece of cake...really, you'll be sore for maybe a week. Heading off to be a bum...felt kind of out of it today...sinus headachey feeling when I bend over- can't be chemo brain yet...maybe prechemo brain...like perimenopause. Your SIS Kimberly",

Glad your SE's aren't too bad, either. Dana- Congrats on the A, but wow, what a sad thing to have three members of the same family dealing with cancer all at once. A BRCA test is a genetic test for cancer. With your history, it seems there may be a genetic link. My dad and twin had the BRCA test done, still waiting for results. Dad had breast and prostate cancer and since I have breast cancer, my twin is eligible to take the test. I just helps with treatment options if you know one way or the other. For me, it will determine if I have a complete hysterectomy since I would, if positive, have a high risk of ovarian cancer. And the oncology thing...man...that's frustrating. It is really important that you are aware if your insurance covers the doctors you're being referred to...but the wait isn't going to hurt you, so don't worry. A month isn't that long, and they got the cancer out during surgery, right? So chemo is just getting any last potential stragglers. I've read many women who have waited even several months to start chemo after surgery. LJ13-How was round #2? SheShe-So glad you checked in. Sorry the SE's are kicking you down. Hang in there. Vettegal-Man. like you needed to be so sick on top of everything....geez. Snuggle in tight,get lots of rest, and take care of yourself. WVgirl- I'm with D1, let it go....everything happens for a reason. You need to focus on just taking care of yourself and getting through this. Your potential promotion could have been way layed by bc, but there is nothing you can do about it, and besides, doing a job you know how to do instead of learning the new stuff may be all you'll be able to deal with right now. Take heart...I know it's a disappointment, but your health comes first. KathyL-So glad to hear your Dad pulled through so well. Yeah on the last day of work!!!!

I haven't been eating much...no appetite...but trying to eat well when I do eat my small meals. Yesterday was like nausea (Compazine), constipation (caused by Comapzine and took fiber and drank Senna tea) , and gas build up (due to constipation...had nothing for that) all at one time....so miserable....and just zero energy...slept a lot...and read some. My dh has been such a sweetheart...making me food that is more bland than he'd normally make. I craved tuna yesterday, so he made me half a tuna melt...no cheese...so technically not a melt, I guess, but it was sooooo good. He made homemade chicken noodle soup for dinner...added some poultry seasoning...just enough to give it some flavor, which tasted good. At this moment, with my tea...a rootbeer barrel candy...I bought a small handful when I was in San Diego this summer, and never did anything with them.

I've read all the posts, but have to leave in an hour and need to shower first, so not a lot of shout outs. Carol - Yes, my dh plays golf. Was your camping adventure this past weekend, or the one coming up? D1- I so thought of you when I heard that NPR story. Travel safely.  Oh, your mom's book sounds like a great story. Paula - I am so glad Ed is doing so well. If he's up for being amorous, he's doing AWESOME!  And a new dishwasher isn't a bad thing especially if it's an energy efficient one compared to the one that died. I am with you on prefering a dishwasher to doing it by hand. Julie- Thinking of you today!  Whoohoo, foobie time! Theresa- So good to hear from you. I'm so glad all was Fabulous on your first check up. Kathy - Sounds like you're ready for a break. You've been a busy gal.  A year is coming up fast. Isn't it amazing how time has flown in hind sight?  I'm calling my surgery date my first anniversary of being NED. Not sure how I feel about my dx date yet. I do know that my teacher friend, the one who was dx a day or two after me, and I will get together as we've talked about  not losing touch once school starts by doing coffee every Friday morning as our time to catch up. LWDana- I'm so thrilled for you being able to anticipate such a wonderful 'cation after graduation in October. It will be here before you know it, and you so deserve a 'cation. Norma- I'm thinking it's an ovary thing. My teacher friend had that kind of pain on Tamox. Her doc told her it was the Tamox and advised getting the ooph if it continued.  She got her period back, too, and she's my age, 47. I wonder if Tamox is connected to that little joy you both have to deal with OK, I've really got to go. Take care gals. I'll check back in on Sunday. Love ya, SIS Kimberly ",

Isn't that a wonderful testimony to the power of connection and healing.  Even though we may not need eachother's words everyday, we are still so much in one another's thoughts and in one another's hearts. To each of you...walk in peace knowing that everything is as it should be at each moment in time. Take time to appreciate each moment even if it isn't what you'd hoped it would be...remember that in judging our moments as good or bad we often miss what those moments have to offer.  Take a deep breath and accept each moment as it is for what it is. Thinking of all the Jewels today.  Walking on Sunshine, SIS Kimberly",

B9 is exactly what the doctor ordered!!!! Heck ya you deserve a celebratory drink. Marianne- I am so sorry you were blindswiped by your diagnosis..aren't we all? Cancer sucks!!! When do you start treatment (chemo and/or rads)? Do you know what stage or grade your tumor is? The hormone receptivity? Be patient with yourself and your recovery. Two weeks is nothing...your body has been through a mjor trauma. I had a bilateral mastectomy on 12/6 and I'm still not able to do everything I did before...it just takes time. Here's the good news about January...you won the lottery when you found us!!!! The gals here are so wonderful...you'll laugh, cry, rant, and feel safe here... just let us be here for you. Paula-How cool that you can check in while partaking in the chemotini!!! Glad all seems to be going well. Maz- Yes, cancer does have perks. We have valet parking at our oncology center....nice...especially when it's raining hard. SheShe- I am so glad that you got the headache under control with Tylenol and dripping slower...excellent. CathyCa- French cooking...OooLaLa...dinner at your house!!!! Have fun in Utah...stay warm. wvgirl- Way to take charge of your treatment. Hope cutting back helps with the sleep issue.

Lots of meetings today. No classroom time at all. I'll get to do that tomorrow.  I have a student teacher, so once she's on board (week 4), she'll take my 1st period class for trimester one and the start of trimester two.  We'll need to have time to plan together, so I'm thinking we'll have early morning get togethers to discuss our lessons. Kathy - I'm so glad to hear that insitu can be 100% cured and that Christina doesn't have to do anything else. The thread I read where some were upset didn't have anyone there to tell them what you told me.   About the Herceptin, can you believe you'll be totally done in just five months? Is that once a month? Enjoy the last days of vacation. Julie - I don't even want to think about grading papers. I hear you on that being one thing I didn't miss. Wow, getting the house on the market in just a few weeks is great. Hopefully the house will sell as soon as your dh hopes, but I tend to think you're right about the market being so slow that it may take longer than one thinks.  Good luck getting through that chapter. You've got new texts this year,correct?  To all our other Jewels,  I'll check in tomorrow. Kimberly ",

      "Content": "Aug 24, 2008 02:51PM - edited Aug 24, 2008 02:57PM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, I've been having a heck of time staying asleep the past few days in a row. Awake around 3:30 am and up until after 4:30. I didn't get out of bed, just tried to relax...but man I can't keep on doing this once school starts.  Sigh.... Oh, and who said something about a vitamin for neuropathy? What was it? A vitiman B of some sort? Paula- Man you have got yourself one busy schedule for the next few months. I think you may need more than Wheaties. Wish I still had my SuperGirl cape, I'd send it to you. Good luck to you this next week as you start with kids.  So Carol, what a bummer to come home to issues with Zach. Like D1 said, this really is part of growing up and asserting some independence. Zach's sentiment with the tats is sweet and from a good place. I'm sure he figured if he did it without permission it would be done, and he wouldn't have to fight for what he wanted, but really bad judgment on the 'friends' tat needle. I hope he didn't get himself into a health mess not going to a professional tattoo parlour, and I hope that he feels it was worth the trouble he's gotten himself into with Dad.   I agree that a more stable schedule will be good for him. Two weeks at a time sounds perfect.  This too shall pass, Carol. Zach is a good kid from what you've told me and the Jewels, he's just going through what all young men go through trying to find their place in the world. Greg has had his nose in the 'must' daily as he punched down the skins twice a day. This morning the sugar levels told him it was time to go from cold soak to fermentation, so Kimberly was up to her elbows in grape skins squeezing out the juices. My fingernails and cuticules are a beautiful purple.  I'll be jumping in the shower right after I finish posting to see if I can get more of this off. We are now in fermentation mode.We put the skins and seeds out in the yard under the vineyard to encourage the good yeasts to grow and to fertilize the vines. So, we've decided to call our winery Forbidden Gate winery and our first vintage ,Second Leaf, and our blend, Merlotah. Good luck with the talk today. A glass of wine afterwards might be in order, eh? And good job taking care of those bottles of wine...temp makes a huge difference in the quality...keeping a stable temp is best.  D1- Glad the college girl is back at school and ready to hit it. Isn't it funny how quickly our kids can just adjust to their surroundings like flipping a switch?  Being her second year, she's probably much more comfortable than her freshman year.  Did she have all of her new stuff out and ready before you left or did she want to put her place together on her own? Have fun going to colleges and visiting Joan on Monday. I know you've already left and hopefully with a camera. My friend lives in Arlington as well. Maybe your dh knows him, Tom Lehner. We had a great visit. Now I have two people I can come visit in Washington DC.  Kris - Thick black hairs on the cheek area just below your eye?  Weird...and oh, yeah, so not what you wanted to see. Pluck those puppies!  As far as using your insurance now that you've reached your deductible, I say GO FOR IT!!!! No use in waiting and racking up more medical bills if your insurance will cover it 100%. The only good news about the bills you had to pay out of pocket is you can deduct those on your taxes if they are a certain % of your income. Do you have someone do taxes for you or do you do them using software?  Either way, don't forget to see if you qualify for the medical expenses deduction. A Jewels get together early next summer would be great!!!!  I get out of school June 12th. Somewhere not too hot would be a good choice...San Diego or Santa Barbara, maybe? I know we talked about Arizona, but we need to do that in the spring if we're going there.  Or maybe we should meet somewhere in the middle of the US so everyone can travel an equal distance...a nice lake or river area? Have a great day ladies. To those who have been MIA for awhile, hope all is well. SP's have been mailed, so expect your new SP for Sept - Nov next week.  If you want to send one last goodie to your current SP, you've got this next week to get that done. Tootles, SIS Kimberly ",

Grrrr. So, we had Back to School night tonight.  It went well. We had 8 minutes per class to tell them everything they need to know about our class.  I pointed them to my website for the more detailed version. Classes are maxed out in Language Arts, but my Study Skills is only 20, which is good as they are low kids and need more one on one. My student teacher is a doll and will start teaching in my 1st period class by the end of next week. We have to start co planning next Tuesday so she can start teaching some lessons.  Physical Therapy is done for the most part. I can go back if I need to go back, so that's good to know.  I need to start doing weights now at home, so I'll be getting up at 6 am starting next week. I've gotten myself up earlier each day, so by next week, 6am should be no problem.  I can also start the district offered classes after work next week.  Yoga and Cardio Sculpt alternate days with Friday off. My eyes are really drooping shut...so I've got to go. I'll do a better job of this on Saturday morning.  Love ya gals, Kimberly ",

      "Content": "Sep 8, 2008 10:51PM - edited Sep 8, 2008 10:55PM by SISKimberly Hey lady Jewels, The BBQ was nice. Jon cooked everything. He's still learning, but I so appreciated his efforts. Classes still aren't settled. Seems it could be a few more days or even until the end of the week to get all the numbers evened out. Our Dean isn't doing it this in a logical manner and our scheduler is frustrated as she sees how it could be more easily done. Unfortunately, she's the new kid on the block, so she doesn't want to ruffle feathers. Totally understand. So, I gained 2 really low kids in 1st period even though I lost 5, so I'm really only down 3. WTF!!!!!   I haven't lost any in 5th or 6th yet, but gained another really low kid in 6th.  Maybe things will shift tomorrow.  FLEXIBLE...deep breaths...and reminding myself that I can only do what I can do. All our hurricane maidens, D1, Kathy, and LJ13, I'm so glad to hear you're all OK and no damage was done. Carol - The Forbidden Gate is just resting now for the next 6 to 12 months before bottling. The Zin should be ready soon to pick. The heat has been crazy, so Greg needs a few cool days in a row to get a better sugar reading. This week should see a cooling trend. I'm sorry to hear about Steph. Give him our best wishes and hugs.  I can't even imagine how hard that must be to watch him just getting more frail. ((((HUGS)))) for you both.  D1- I worked out today. Went to yoga but the teacher didn't show, so I went back to school and did 30 minutes on the eliptical and then did some weights...not heavy or a ton of reps yet, but I did it!!! Kathy - Hoping #2 does the trick for your tats and nips. My ps asked if I wanted to do that and I said nope. I'm good since they'd only be visually effective and not reactionary like my old nips were.  Having a real breast and a reconstucted breast, however, is a different story.  Jules- I've got papers staring at me, too, but I'm too tired, so I'm going to save them and try to get a few done each morning. Tuesdays and Thursdays will be my day to stay late and grade, and then go work out. LOL...on the floor!!!!  Pass your dicks in is a much funnier faux pa (or however you spell that).  OK, I'm bushed.

I will sooo be thinking of you this weekend as I grade essays and you walk your 20 miles a day...I'm thinking we're going to battle it out for who will be the worse for wear. Hahaha D1- Boy I hear ya on the 'roundness' just appearing out of nowhere. OK, so mine appeared after chemo was almost done.  I hoped it would go away, but NO...it's quite happy sitting right around my middle.  Personally, I think you look great. We often see ourselves very differently than others see us, but I know what you mean about looking at pics and thinking, when did that happen? I went to yoga today. I took my pedometer to school, and it looks like I walk on an average day just at school over 4,000 steps. They aren't aerobic steps like when I go for a walk, but I take enough steps to cover 1.64 miles. Not bad. And what is with not sleeping?  Dr. Oz says that getting enough sleep is vital for good health.  I hope your vitamins and your Tylenol PM help you get at least 6 hours. I'd be worthless without at least 6 hours.  I need more like 7 or 8.  Paula - You so need a personal secretary to help you keep up with everything you do. Man, you are one busy gal.  I guess getting the blood work and the scans is covering all the bases, so why not. Like you said, if insurance wants to cover it, then why not?  I hope you're doing something nice for yourself each day to nurture yourself.  I haven't heard from Dana....or others for that matter.  Hope everyone is doing OK.

Diana63-I totally understand your need to just not stress out and do what you can to make things work. If you had coverage before...with the same company...they should have no issues reinstating you. So, no Cobra between jobs...did you find out you had bc with the old insurance plan? If so, then they really shouldn't turn you down now just because you couldn't afford to pay for the COBRA costs. I'm keeping my fingers and toes crossed for you that something comes up smelling good soon. wvgirl- Oh yeah...go for the Mirilax. My dh told me to tell you that you need to look at the stages of grief...he was angry when he first heard my diagnosis. It took a few weeks to sink in for him...I noticed he was grumpy...but never yelled at me or anything...but I knew this wasn't just about me, so I wrote him a card explaining that I knew this didn't happen to me and that being on the sidelines must be very frustrating for him as he must feel so helpless. I told him that I understood he needed time to adjust, but that I was there to talk with him when he was ready...that we'd do this thing together. He said the card really helped him. Like I said...he needs to know you understand it isn't easy for him either, but that what he can do to help is...(whatever you need....and ask him what he needs,too). My dh wanted me to tell him what I needed 'cause he didn't want to hover. Kathy- so glad you're sounding so much better each time you post from home. I'm really liking the girls. I won't be able to do the exchange for 12 to 18 months after my rads is over. The ps stated my body and skin will continue to go through changes over time, and he wants that all cleared up so he gets the best possible result. I'm fine with that...just means I can wait until summer '09 to do it and not have to miss school. ;-) sista2-My dad and my twin tested negative for the BRCA1 and 2 gene, so it looks like I don't have to take the test now. Hooray!!!! I hope yours is negative, too. Carol- Are you considering a hysterectomy? I've been considering it and want to do it to make sure I cut down as much estrogen as possible. I've been reading about Tamox and don't like the side effects at all. The gals on the threads about Tamox often complain about the se's. I just read one today about a gal who's giving it up...the se's are just too much for her. She tried the other drugs as well and had bad se's with them. I'm looking at Evista if my doctor insists I have to take a preventitive med. It's given to patients to improve bones and has had a better effect on fighting invasive breast cancer than Tamox. The National Cancer Institute did a STAR study of over 19,000 women enrolled of Raloxifene(Evista) vs Tamoxifen in preventing Invasive Breast Cancer. 36% few uterine cancers (.0048% of the 4,712 on Evista - @ half the group had hysterectomies at the time of the study- compared to .007 of the 4,732 women on Tamox ) and 29% fewer blood clots than those taking Tamox. No risk of cateract development as with Tamox, either. Sorry about your hoot hurting...symptoms, but no flow...not a bad trade off...or course it isn't my hoot that's hurting. The wine was soooo good!!!! I know after tomorrow, I'll be sans my taste buds for another few weeks, so had to get that in while the taste buds were active. So speaking of happy taste buds...had anyone lost weight (6 pounds during chemo week and the week after), then gained it back when the taste buds came back because you were like hording good flavors? Yeah, that would be me. I'm so going to have to rethink that whole philosophy. I need to keep my weight down...lose a few actually as excess fat is an estrogen producer. I'm just going to have to say no to all the really good, but not so good for me, eating parties I've been having and pick up the get your butt movin' moto instead. I need to exercise way more than I do now that's for sure. D1- So envious of your butt massage!!!! I can't lay on my chest yet, so no massages for me until I can do that. I'm only 8 weeks out from surgery, and it may take 12 weeks to totally heal. I've got pretty good range of motion back...the left is tighter than the right, but my ps was very impressed. He said you don't need pt...what you're doing is working. Keep doing it...it just takes time. Way to go on getting the hips adjusted. My chiropractor had to do that for me when I went to him. It makes a difference. I haven't gone in a long time though. You had a big day today! Good for you...I so agree that on those good days get as much done as you can. I'm sure you read my message to Kathy and know when I can get the exchange done. I thought about not doing reconstruction, but thought...I don't think I'm quite ready for flat forever...and two boobs in a box. I had nightmares of them falling out during class. heehee. I did experience being totally flat when I first came home, and it wasn't so bad at all, but as I got pumped up...I liked it better. I'm glad you're happy with your hoot. Vettegal- Sorry you're not feeling 100% today...take care and just listen to your body...it knows what it needs. ARDeb-Good news on your new treatment #2 date and glad you are feeling better!!!! So,it's about 5:40, and I'm off to drink some water with EmergenC -Cranberry flavor- with my Miralax mixed in as I prepare for tomorrow. Also taking my second dose of Calcium with a handful of almonds. Haven't thought about dinner yet... I'll take my second dose of Decadron around 8pm along with my Valium to help me sleep, then off to LaLa Land for a good night's sleep before Super Girl grabs her martini glass and takes her baldacious self to Club Survival. Black Cat Chemotini's all around. My dh is taking pics, so I'll post one of my alter ego when I get it downloaded from the camera. See you in the morning, Jewels. Cheers. SIS Kimberly",

CAS- I'm so sorry you're having a recurrance. I wish you all the best with your chemo treatment and eventual surgery. If you read through our thread, you'll get lots of information about how those of us who have been through round #2 have faired. Personally, I'm taking all three at once every 21 days. I started Jan 8, 2008 and just had my second round 1/29/08. Round two kicked my butt pretty good compared to round #1...although I wasn't prepared for the digestive acrobats of round#1...no nausea, and I knew there would be possible constipation or diareah, but I wasn't prepared for the rock in my gut 24/7 , the heartburn or the gas. Round #2 I was ready...just felt a lot more tired and weak than the first round. Don't know it that's a cummulative thing or what. Going every two weeks is going to be tough...I go every 21 days. You won't have lots of time to recoup. Just listen to your body...rest...drink lots of water...eat small meals... Your hair will start to come out within the first 14-16 days...mine came out sooner, but I have baby fine hair, so maybe that is what the difference was for me. Good luck, CAS. Drop by anytime for support if you need it. Joan- I'm glad that you've gotten to the point of feeling up to going back to work. As far as placing your, Mom...hard stuff...but a relief to know she's in a safe place where she can't accidently hurt herself. Are you all close enough to take turns with other family members visiting her? I know that in itself can be exhausting if you're the only one doing the visiting because everyone else is so far away. Hope your first day back to class is a good one...gets lots of rest when you can...and steer clear of those germs. ;-) So, today I go get the wig trimmed. I might even think about getting another for fun...maybe red! I'll check in later, SIS Kimberly",

Started feeling a bit stuffy headed\u2026I better not be catching a cold. So, I just hung out and rested a lot. I did make dinner for the dh...since I've got the energy now and won't next week. And my skin is starting to break out\u2026I stopped using one face lotion the other day as it just felt too harsh. Hard to believe my skin is reacting a few days later. I\u2019ve got sensitive skin Oil of Oley now. Is this a hormone thing? I haven't broken out in so long...are we getting to do adolesence again? Julie- Glad the doc is being proactive and asking you to come back for an Aloxi boost to stop the horrid vomiting se\u2019s you were having. Let\u2019s hope that it does the trick. Man that\u2019s a lot of meds to head off a headache. I agree that more needs to be done to find out why and which hormones cause migrains, and how then to keep those hormones in check, so you don\u2019t get migrains in the first place. CHJ- Don\u2019t you look great in your FUBC shirt? Glad all went well with your counts. Paula-I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re not feeling well. I\u2019ll send positive energy your way\u2026gotta be well for your infusion and your keep on schedule for that competition. Vettegal- Stylin\u2019 the hats today eh? I\u2019m with you on wearing my wigs\u2026has to be the right occasion, otherwise, I\u2019m good with ball caps or scarves or just plain naked. D1- I\u2019m so glad we surprised you with the flowers!!!! And I\u2019m very proud of you for staying out of the cake all day\u2026thank goodness for Hersheys, eh? LOL with the Homer Simpson sound effects. Hope the dd played and played well. wvgirl- I have always been a little anemic, too. However, I was more so the past few years, and even more the 6 months before discovering my cancer. I do believe that is a telltale sign\u2026cancer needs blood. My doc kept asking if I had heavy flows, and I said no. Tested negative for colon bleeding. My iron was really low in late July\u2026like had it been one point lower, I would have had to have a blood transfusion. Started 900mg of iron daily. Had my blood tested in August. It went up slightly. Tested again in late September, and it went up again slightly, and then had my mammogram and the rest is history. Have you taken the offer for counseling? How are things going at home? Kris-Hang in there...your dh is right. One step closer to being done. I was thinking today...I've got 9 days of feeling pretty good and then I have to do the feeling crappy thing again...but reminded myself that I'm half way to being done with chemo next week, and that helped... some. I\u2019ll check back in the morning ladies. SIS Kimberly",

It seems like i was just looking forward to a week off, and now it's almost time to go back to work. Crazy how time seems to fly faster and faster. Sherry, you must have been posting the same time I was. Sorry to hear that you've been sick. With the crazy hours you're working I imagine there isn't time to get the rest you need and to really take care of yourself.  At least the job is getting easier for you, so that's got to be some consolation. Lj13 - Hmmm, a traveling turkey dinner...I guess we sort of did that with everyone chipping in a dish and all meeting at my son's gf's parent's house.  D1 mentioned your dining room set...we still haven't seen pictures of it unless the one of your hand was over the table. Hahaha.  I recall it was like a 1950's malt shop booth? (or did I just dream that?) A year being cancer free is something to celebrate in my book, but I totally understand your stance. Can I say WhooHoo for you?  D1- Speaking of WHooHoo, the drought is over!!!!  The not touching the breasts issue can be dealt with in time, but the fact your drought is over is such a big deal!!!!! I'm sorry telling your dh how you were feeling didn't go well. Sometimes it is hard for men to hear their women talk about their feelings because they don't know what to do with them. How can he fix that?  It isn't tangable.  On the other hand, many feel they are somehow being blamed for our feelings when we share them. So, maybe ending the drought was his way of dealing with what he heard you saying? I agree that you need to find the right fit in a counselor.  I'd give her one more go and let her know what you're feeling toward the end of the next session if you feel you don't think you two are clicking. With your busy schedule, I can imagine finding time to be Flexed would be a problem...but the alternative isn't such a good one, right? How exciting that your dd is going to write a screenplay for a scholarship. Carol, man, that must have been some lightening bolt.  My port site is pretty sore, and I've got to press on it to encourage the skin to reconnect with the other tissue since there is now a hole where my port once lay.  Did you have to do that?  I'm glad you got in some golf, some noshing, and football. Sorry your Seahawks lost so badly...again. Caught the game before dinner on Thanksgiving. Carla, how sad about your friend and her husband, and even more tragic how their teenage sons must be feeling.  Are they with relatives? What a great thing that your oncologist has such a great raport with his patients. Yes, indeed, we have all come such a long way. I'm sending out the new SP's on Monday, so you should be getting them sometime next week.  Take care all,  SIS Kimberly",

And you put out some great d words to put in front of the h\u2026just know as Carol said\u2026lower case is positive and upper case means there\u2019s trouble in paradise. Carol- Well\u2026glad you got the 4th FUBC-er MF out of the way. :-) and that your Mirilax kicked in\u2026oh, the simple pleasures we delight in, girls. Wow, the dh commutes part way to work on bike\u2026impressive. Is he biking to a bus or the ferry for the remainder of his commute?

I don\u2019t get a bag of each of those\u2026I have large syringes of Aloxi and other se preventatives (no pepcid). I also get my Adriamycin in a big syringe. Hope your onc can give you some advice on the digestive issues. LJ13- So glad that your #4 went so well. Whew, done with that!!!! Hopefully the Herceptin doesn\u2019t have se\u2019s that are too bad especially cause you\u2019re doing it for a year. Your partner sounds like she\u2019s a doll.

Hope the MUGA goes well. CHJ- Let\u2019s hope if the truck comes, it\u2019s not a semi and only runs over you once if it has no choice than to hit you. Jenn- I so loved hearing about what you and the dh do\u2026how wonderful that you work for a family owned business and they you two really are like family to the owners. Everyone should feel so supported. Glad you were up to going in last night and today. Paula- Glad to hear your cold is only a night nuisance and that you\u2019re able to be there for your students as they prepare for the competition. Suz- I\u2019m so glad to hear that sense of humor at the end\u2026whew, you\u2019re going to be fine. 5 years out all ready? I just reread your first post\u2026duh, you said you were diagnosed 5 years ago. So you can give up tips!!!! Are you taking Tamoxifin or an AI? If so, what has your experience been? About meds. It sometimes takes awhile to find the right anti-depressant and the right dosage. I PM\u2019d you not knowing all this info, so some of what I said won\u2019t apply now. Anyway, yeah, the shock of the family history and worrying about your daughters can be overwhelming, but the good news like I said is knowing so your daughters can be vigilant. How are your family members doing? Take care, sweetie. Kris- Welcome to the club!!!! You\u2019ve got to get a pic with all the guys at work that live up to their end of the bargain. And\u2026it sounds like the dh is being supportive and helpful. Wendy- Thanks for giving me the info on your Avastin and Taxotere x12. Interesting\u2026hope the study bears out positive results. And welcome to you to the club\u2026glad you still have your ears and didn\u2019t lose any blood\u2026not good on the blood count numbers. :-) How sweet that the dh and the ds did the honors\u2026and were shaking \u2018cause they didn\u2019t want to cut you\u2026I\u2019d be a little nervous,too\u2026but it all turned out well.

I noticed he perked right up for that once he 'remembered'.  GEEZE!!!!! Good info on the sleeve and LE.  I've had what I think is le swelling and both my ps and onc. say no, I'm still healing.  Then why does it feel worse at times than at others?  I will broach the subject again on Monday before chemo with the onc.  It's been almost 3 months since surgery...3 months on the 6th. Oh, and the taste bud thing is annoying, isn't it?  The alternating tastes good/doesn't taste good thing is crazy. I too have to force myself to eat, but it sure doesn't seem like the extra pounds gained reflects that much. Maybe it is more my sedintary lifestyle these days than the eating, not that I always eat the very best things for myself all the time.  I'm more and more trying to watch what I eat, however, as I don't want this weight to skyrocket out of control. Glad to be here for the rant....it feels good doesn't it?  Hope the rest of your day goes better. SIS Kimberly ",

I have to be gone by 11am so I can do my labs (didn't feel like going out yesty, so I didn't), then off to school to have lunch with my colleagues (one wants to try on my red wig as she loved the style and wants to see how it looks on her),to turn in my homework-our idea for a focus for next year, and to meet with the gal for my 125 Plan renewal. At 4, it's off to yoga. Carol- I'm so sorry about your having to pucker those cheeks. Maybe ½ a dose the day before next time? Hey, no problem with the borrowing of research. I'm not one to just sit back and do what I'm told without good reason. If I can get the same results without the se's by doing an ooph and not Tamox, I'm all over that. I just can't see putting more toxins into my body for such a low potential result. Remember, they report the relative stats, which make it appear that there is a 49% reduction rate in recurrence/first time breast cancer, when in actuality, it's .049%. I also found out the makers of Tamox, make Arimidex-the newest kid on the block being pushed because the patent is running out on Tamox. The makers made DES, the first known carcinogenic endocrine-disrupting drug. Against the advice of the creator between 4-6 million American women and 10,000 Australian women were given this drug to \u2018prevent' miscarriages and pregnancy complications.  In addition, it became the drug used for suppression of lactation, the treatment for acne, the treatment of certain kinds of breast and prostatic cancer, an inhibitor of growth in young girls, an estrogen replacement in menopause, and a \u2018morning after' pill. It would take 30 years for the company to admit what they knew in 1938, DES is a dangerous and highly harmful drug. It was reported that women who took DES were 40 to 50% more likely to get breast cancer than those women who never took it. There were other horrible consequences like vaginal cancer and birth defects. Once DES was pulled, the company using it's research from this drug eventually came up with Tamoxifen, which causes the same abnormal cell changes found in women taking DES. It was first approved as a birth control pill, but proved to induce ovulation rather than inhibit it, so because there was a reduction in lab rats injected with breast cancer cells, it is now being given to humans. To top it off, the company that makes these drugs to \u2018treat' cancer also manufactures pesticides which cause cancer. They're making their money on both ends. Sorry for the rant. Lots to absorb. LOL on the old guys with the big DENIED rubber stamp image. It certainly feels like that doesn't it. They are betting that the majority of people will not bother to fight that battle. They don't know you very well, do they? Hope the sleeve fitting goes well. Have fun with the mil and here's to not needing a cork! I'm with you on the recliner being more my speed most of the time even though I agree that moving more would be helpful. CathyCa- I'll bet you're right about exercising daily making it easier. I'm going to keep up the yoga two days a week and add in weight training on my good days this round. Every little step forward is progress. Thank you for inspiring me. And homemade chocolate truffles...what a yummy exam. I had to make a yellow cake with dark chocolate frosting the other day...craving...and I'm not a dessert person normally...just once in a great while. This is a new craving. Sun Chips were great for about a day or so, and now they're not so good. The only things that never let me down are eggs and fruit and toast. Can you find out if your friend had chemo and how many nodes if any were positive? Node positive 4 or more seems to be a tipping factor. Thanks. LWDana- WhooHoo, chemo-virgin no more!!!! The burning is the chemo passing through...Prep H gel and soaks in a warm bath help. I didn't have itching, but I did have the chemo glow. You're still on the Decadron high, so be prepared for the crash. Congrats on the B!!!!  Wish your pic was bigger, hard to really see your pretty face. SheShe- Sorry about the mix up for the 3rd, but you're on board now and that's what matters. I'm so glad you like the new cancer center better. I heard that headaches could happen and glad it seems better today. Take care of yourself, and I know you said you'd check in later, but just in case, we will be here on the other side of the fog when you're back. And...you did check in later with a great list of shout outs. Glad you're feeling good still. Paula- How exciting that the competition is just days away. I'll bet your kids are so excited and nervous. Good luck and look forward to updates this weekend. D1- Glad Burka gal didn't come to visit last night. That is so cool about growing up in the Bahamas and how your sis is doing such good work down there. Yeah, I'm getting to the burn out point after 21 years. Hopefully, when I get back next year, my NCLB diet will allow me to get back to what I know teaching and learning should be instead of the test, test, test focus. I'm so sorry that the rads se list is getting you down. The good news is that this rads onc sounds like he'd do anything to help you be comfortable, so more pt, massages, and sleeves paid for by insurance. You won't be able to wear the sleeve will you? Maybe I don't understand how they fit. Excellent t-shirt story, and yes, we Jewels are da bomb! Kathy- I am so sorry you missed the memorial last night. But it sounds like your body really needed the rest. Glad you're feeling better mentally and physically this morning. I'm so there when you're ready to get our book written. Take it easy today. OK, gotta go get ready. See you tonight gals. SIS Kimberly",

Please know that I felt your love and support. I love you guys. Just wanted to let you know I am alive. March 17th- St. Patrick\u2019s Day seems like a very good day to emerge from a thick fog hangin\u2019 o\u2019er the moor I had lost myself in these past days. Moors can be very tricky to navigate ye know. For those unaware of my Scottish Heritage, I have great affection for the Celtic, and this seemed a good analogy for me to use on this day. A moor is an extensive waste covered with patches of heath, or low shrubs, and have a poor, light soil (something akin to my pale pallor), but can sometimes be marshy, and abounding in peat which is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation matter. Yep\u2026that describes it as I truly did feel like a partially decayed piece of vegetative matter for sure\u2026that is until just a few hours ago.  It is so weird how it happens. Literally, it is like someone simply lifted the veil between myself and time, and suddenly there I was once again amongst the living.  Now, if I liked the stuff, I might have me a nip of a good Scottish Whiskey, but doubt my stomach would agree with that much celebration, nor would my lack of energy support me in dancin\u2019 a jig. The news, which I could categorize as \u2018good\u2019 seeing as I\u2019m looking for the bright side here, and thinking if I\u2019m going to be down anyway, I might as well be DOWN, is that I developed an infection of the left (it isn\u2019t really a breast, now is it?) mound (OK, so why did the jingle for Mounds just play inside of my head?). It was pretty painful and quite attractive, so the dh called the ps who called in a prescription for antibiotics Sat. morning.  When I saw the Doc this morning, he explained how easily that could happen with my immune system being so compromised and told me he was glad we hadn\u2019t waited to contact him. Whew!!!! So on a beautiful sunny evening\u2026yes it is still sunny at 6:20 pm\u2026I\u2019m happy to report that this member of Clan Montgomery is amongst the living once again. Slainte Mhah (Good Health)!!! SIS Kimberly",

Sista- Man I hear ya on feeling knocked out. I wish I could help ya on the se\u2019s of Taxotere vs AC, but I\u2019m doing all three at once. Anywhoo, glad to hear from you and to know that Taxotere has been easier on you. LJ13- You sound so well!!!!  I love that you are the go to gal for Taxol/Taxotere especially since I don\u2019t know which of my numerous lovely se\u2019s are attributed to which of the three chemo drugs I take. I think they like to blend se\u2019s myself. Tinalee- Bummer you missed the chili feed last night, but wow, all that chili in an hour and a half? That\u2019s great!!!! The good news, you were able to go to your fish fry tonight and are ready to stay ahead of those se\u2019s. Have a great weekend with your family. LWDana \u2013 First of all, no one is picking on you. I know you feel that way, but really people are only expressing their viewpoints. Second, I wasn\u2019t offended at all. I just disagreed with something you said rather vehemently and offered my opinion. Offering an opinion doesn\u2019t mean being offended. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had such a rough upcoming. I\u2019ve had some tough stuff to get through in my life too, and I understand the survival instinct you feel. Sweetie, the rollercoaster ride I was talking about\u2026you confirmed yourself\u2026 \u201dI do have a thin line between love and hate and I am human.\u201d In just a few short posts you went from being really angry at the system to being thrilled about losing your hair. It wasn\u2019t an indictment, only an observation.  I\u2019m sorry you felt attacked.  You have come a long way, and you should be so proud of what you have accomplished.  It\u2019s great that you recognize you\u2019re still growing and learning as a human in this world as we all are. Nope, hard pill to swallow doesn\u2019t work for me. I like Little Warrior\u2026it does fit you\u2026ready for battle, but still needing to hone her craft first. I\u2019m glad your hair will be a symbol for you of letting the real you out and honoring her. My comment about you being happy about losing your hair, again, an observation based on your words, not a criticism or judgment.  I too am much happier going bald and do most of the time even in public. We love you Little Warrior, whether or not we agree with you on everything. That\u2019s what sisters are all about. A few of that gals have had an extended visit from Aunt Flo, so I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re on track. SheShe- I am so thrilled for you that your bone scan came back clear!!!! And only one more chemotini to suck down?  WhooHoo is right on both counts!!!! SIS Kimberly ",

The lip is getting better, but you should see me eat or drink\u2026it\u2019s pretty funny. I have to bite on the right to avoid the canker sore like thing on my bottom lip, then chew on the left side to avoid the sore right back side of my mouth. Paula- I wish I could use my computer in bed, but alas our \u2018network\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to like talking to my Mac. I liked your diamond in the rough analogy and your words to Dana. Hope you have a wonderful weekend. Carol- LOL - packing the swimming boob and the thought of it going through the x-ray machine and being targeted for a search. My oncologist checks my \u2018breasts\u2019, lymph nodes, belly, and listens to my heart every 3rd week. Oh, and checks my finger nails. LWDana- Oh sweetie, there is no need to apologize for anything. You didn\u2019t \u2018let me down\u2019 at all. What you did was remind me of myself when I was younger and trying to work through my stuff, and I guess that\u2019s why I felt I needed to state my opinion. Again, I am not judging you, only making observations based on what you say. Observations help us to see things from a different perspective, and I was offering you a different perspective. I too vote we move on from this. I\u2019m glad that your friends took you out for your bday and that the oncology nurse made you smile\u2026and she\u2019s right. You do have a good heart, and you will be a great comfort to any hospital\u2019s patients. (((HUGS))) Tinalee- With only my bottom lip being puffy, I look like quite the pouter\u2026is that a look the gals in Hollywood want? HaHaHa Patty- So, that\u2019s our Vettegal\u2019s name. Hi, Patty.  Brad\u2019s been busy taking care of all the kids, so I haven\u2019t seem much of him. HaHaHa  Love the basket idea for your dh.  I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll love it. CarolC- Oh snuggle in sweetie with your little furry ones and take care, OK? (((HUGS))) KathyL- Well said!!!  Now, take Carol\u2019s cue and go snuggle in and take care. You need your rest for the Easter Bunny festivities tomorrow. Julie- How great to spend time crackin\u2019 up with the family. NO colds allowed!!!!  Take some extra Vit C and rest up. And thanks for the compliment about being prettier than Angelina Jolie. I think she\u2019s an outstandingly lovely woman in so many ways. D1- Hope you're having a great time with the family and that your chemo se's are disappearing with each passing day now that chemo is done for you. To all our other Jewels, have a wonderful day. Take care if you're in the fog. SIS Kimberly ",

Just got all sorts of hugs from my kids, former students who are now in 8th grade or kids visiting from college during spring break,and all the staff. Gotta love those HUGS!!!!  I\u2019m whipped though\u2026stayed from 12:30pm until after 4 pm. D326- Hi, glad you found us.  We are a great group of gals for certain.  I\u2019m doing TAC every 21 days x 6. Having that third week is key for me.  If I didn\u2019t have one week of feeling really good, I couldn\u2019t do it.  I can\u2019t speak for the gals with the split every two weeks schedule, however. You will lose your hair\u2026but we\u2019ve all got Balditude going now!!!!  You will have side effects to varying degrees. Be prepared for the big C-constipation. We like Miralax as it is gentle on the system. You may also get heartburn and gas. Pepcid AC and Gas X are a must. Take these the day before chemo and for the next several days as needed to keep ahead of the se\u2019s. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s a problem. Dry nose- Vaseline. Dry eyes- Saline eye drops. Bone and muscle aches are common with both Taxotere and Neulasta given to revitalize WBC counts. Ibuprofin seems to work. Dexadron, the steroid you\u2019ll take before, during, and after the day of chemo, will wire you up, so having a sleep aid the night you take Dexadron will be helpful. These seem to be the ones most of us have experienced. Others have had neuropathy issues. Come by anytime to ask questions, OK? Paula- Oh, I love Dogwoods and the sound of frogs\u2026daffodils and crocus, too. Sorry the game was cancelled, but what the heck, at least ds didn\u2019t have to get soaked in the rain. We leave tomorrow afternoon for Tahoe. I can\u2019t wait to just change the scenery!!!! PALady- Compression jeans, too?  I guess I can\u2019t imagine what that\u2019s like.  So, they\u2019re like really tight jeans? Thanks for the well wishes for our trip.  I so plan to enjoy myself. My girlfriend who just finished chemo almost 6 weeks ago was told not to start her Tamox. until she felt really good. She\u2019s got the script, but hasn\u2019t started it yet. Jenn- I\u2019m so sorry about your friend and so sad for his wife. (((HUGS))) #4 knocked me on my butt, too.  I hate to say it, but I think #5 for me on Tuesday will be just as bad with the whole cumulative thing to consider.  I hope I\u2019m wrong.  Keep that chin up girl\u2026spring really is coming, it\u2019s just taking its time getting to you as it wants to make a grand entrance when you\u2019re really up for enjoying it. That\u2019s my story and I\u2019m sticking to it! Hi Judy- So good to hear from you\u2026but crappy news about you feeling so badly. I have had a cough, but it\u2019s really  just once in a great while that I feel as if my chest is being sat upon and the cough sounds\u2026I don\u2019t know, wet? Does that make sense, but then it goes away.  I\u2019ll send lots of positive energy your way next week as you travel to Vancouver. SheShe- I\u2019m so glad you caught that right away and that the nurses treated you so well. I hope that all is well now that the pic-line is out and that your tests come back clear. Vettegal- I\u2019m so excited for you being done tomorrow!!!! WhooHoo!!!!!   A question: have you had the BRCA test done?  Just curious since cancer is definitely in your family. Being BRCA positive is an indicator for being at high risk for ovarian cancer once you\u2019ve had breast cancer and visa versa. Since Tamox. has a risk of uterine cancer, knowing your BRCA status might present some other treatment options to you and your sister.  Just a thought. I hope your chemo room buddy recoups quickly\u2026what a run of crummy things right after her first tx.  She\u2019s come to the right gal. You know what it\u2019s like to have a rough time and pull through with that wonderful wit. Dana- What happened to your pretty face?  Love milking the chemo thing\u2026and pleased your roomie is playing along. Sounds like he\u2019s being pretty decent now that you\u2019re just roomies.  Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself with the weight. Walking will help with the water weight some, but those steroids are not good for the girlish figure. I got a letter like that in December saying my Mammo was clear.  I too cracked up, and wrote back stating, well, my last letter informed me I needed a biopsy, and then I had a bilateral mastectomy, so I\u2019m thinking this letter may not be addressed to the right person.  The center wrote back apologizing for their error. Kathy- Heck no it\u2019s not awful to wish the kids were in daycare when you\u2019re feeling so totally wiped out!!!!  You poor thing being sick on top of chemo se\u2019s and having to keep up with energetic little people at the same time. SHERO!!!!!  Glad Dad was there to help out! (((HUGS))) Night Jewels, catch you in the morning before we head out. SIS Kimberly Tina- snuck in as I was posting. Thanks for the well wishes on my trip. I am so looking forward to getting away.  Good news about your exchange.  That will be nice to get that done.",

She travels to mostly Asian, African, and Middle Eastern areas, and focuses on the local people. We fell in love with two immediately. They were of Tuareg. At the time, we paid $50 each for unframed 8x10s. The colors are so vivid...oranges of the sands, blues of the headscarves, and faces that are so expressive and beautiful. Anyway, this is a 16x20 of the dunes and a nomadic tribe. You see mostly the orange dunes, and then the line of camels and people walking along some invisible trail with specks of bright blue. It's breathtaking...well at least to us. Lisa  has a gallery now in Sonoma, so this print wasn't a mere $50, but she did sign it, and to us it was worth it. Doing our part to stimulate the economy, right? LOL Afterwards, we visited a unique little artists village and had lunch, then drove home. Now, laundry is going (Paula yours must be done by now), I've been to Facebook to add friends from the Jewels, and have not had time to really play with that site yet. It does look as if it could be a great way to reconnect with people, but my concern is how to fit it into an already busy day with email, our thread, and now Facebook. I guess I could just cancel my email account and go directly to Facebook. That would certainly cut down on the junk email I got. Hmmmm, a consideration. So, what's up with the Jewels? Paula - I am so sorry that you and your family are in this situation. I agree that counseling would be a big help to you all at this crossroad. I know that Hospice was a fabulous resource to my family while my mom battled pancreatic cancer and my grandfather, who lived with Greg and I, lung cancer. (((((HUGS)))). I'm thinking, you are excused from doing your homework assignment. You've got way too much on your plate...unless you find it a welcome distraction of course. Carol - So how did you visit with your 3Day walking buddy go? Jules - I've been sleeping in too much on weekends. I'm still pretty tired from this lovely virus that just won't let go. Hope you had a great relaxing Saturday. Grading papers? Thought you said you had nothing pressing to do after your stressful week? Ugh!!!! Glad you got them done. I was so excited to not have anything to grade this weekend. We are getting ready for the 7th grade writing test starting next week. The test is March 3rd, so we are just going to focus on that for the next month. Thanks for the link. I'll check it out. And no Paula it isn't cheating on the homework. It's helping. You're still going to the site to find out what it has to offer, so technically, it isn't cheating. LOL A conference in Missouri sounds like a nice break. How did your district afford that? We are on budget freeze in CA. No money due to our state gov't not yet passing a budget. Man, if we did our jobs like that, we'd be fired! Carla - How are things going with the dh? I know you mentioned Sharon, Georgia's mommy, but can you refresh my memory? I love buckwheat pancakes. We just bought some buckwheat hot cereal at Whole Foods yesterday. Looking forward to trying that. Deb - WhooHoo, so glad you're going to join us in LV. I know what you mean about still not feeling like my old self. So what are your lasting se's? Mine, achy a lot, stiff when I get up after sitting too long, still foggy headed, low energy, neuropathy in fingers and toes, and my stomach/digestive tract still just isn't right. Let us know how things go with the onc. I see mine on Thursday. Norma - Do send me the links as I'd be interested in researching anything that would prevent me from having to take drugs after my ooph and hysterectomy. I totally understand the point of view about not removing the uterus, but with my family history of cancer (breast, pancreas, and prostate) I'm not taking any chances of endometrial or cervical cancer either. My twinsis and I have been talking about bioidentical hormones lately. Oprah did a big show on it. I haven't heard of Dr. Schwartz, but if she could give you information about using bioidentical hormones as ERPR positive breast cancer survivors to combat the se's of menopause, I am all over that!!!! Whoohoo, for the ds on earning 101 points on his project. I can see where it would be quite a keepsake after all that work, and isn't great when your kids finally get the messages we've been sending for years? LOL on the bribes for reading their projects...I felt that way about my Master's Thesis, which by the way had typos my editor nor I caught after staring at that damn paper for months... I was so sick of it. Your bathroom remodel sounds like it is just what you needed, more room and updated. 100\" of snow and winter isn't even over yet. Dang! We're just thrilled it rained this weekend. Kris - Hysterical about teaching the 11 year olds to tp a house!!!! Thank goodness the drainage is almost done. So, other than that, how are the girls? My issues are that my chest muscles are always tight bringing my shoulders down and feeling tight across the back of my neck and shoulders all the time. I'm constantly stretching. Also, hugs from the huggee's point of view must be uncomfortable. Like two hard mounds on my chest. OH well, I look good in clothes. LOL Yummy, my dh just brought me breakfast...no buckwheat hot cereal this morning. Eggs, bacon, and a whole wheat croissant with a cup of pineapple. Wendy - Whoohoo, another Jewel on board for Vegas!!!! What was the occasion for the girls night out? How fun. Hey Sherry, yep, still dealing with the dregs of this virus. Sorry to hear about your ears. Headsets...that makes sense that bacteria would hang out there and then get into our ears. Get that checked out. Don't want it to get into the inner ear. Patty - What an aweful dream, but that is how our psyche's get rid of anxiety and tries to tie up loose ends. I got this lovely virus the day I started chemo last year...January 8th. Weird huh? I know we all understand the underlying fear that cancer may come back, but the good news is that today, you're cancer free. On the MRIs, false positives or false clean bills of health? D1- Welcome back. Geez, the BB coach does sound like she's losing it as far as making sound judgment calls. And, why does the coach all of a sudden want to take over after giving the job to you, and why must all the work you've done be redone? That doesn't make sense at all. You must be just frustrated beyond belief. Making another player take off her uniform and give it to another player? I wouldn't have taken off my uniform. What was she afraid of, not being played? I know it's hard for kids to stand up for themselves, but that just wasn't right. The other girl needed to learn a lesson. Besides, how does that effect the stats if you aren't wearing your own number? Do you have to tell officials your player forgot her uniform and is wearing someone one else's. Winning seemed to be more important than teaching the life lesson here. Wow, what a journey to the inauguration. Love the Where's Waldo photo teacher. Did you click a pic? How exciting the be right there close enough to see, even if it was with binoculars, history being made. mumayan-kathleen - Did you post on the correct thread? Not sure where you want to fly to nor what event you're talking about joining. Joan - Of course it's OK to have your own room. I only mentioned it, so those who may not have come due to cost, might be more able if they know others are willing to share a room. Tina - Hey, good to see you, and WOW, sold the house already? That is fantastic. Of course, being in the location you are, it was bound to happen quickly. So, you're off to Colorado in a mere 30 to 90 days depending on the length of escrow eh? OK. all caught up. Hope to check in this week like I did last. We shall see. SIS Kimberly...I am going to do my homework now.",

I told my students last week that they had that week to get their acts together as far as work completion, or this week they'd start getting notices sent home. They get two warnings...and then the 3rd would be a Disciplinary Pass to the office for defiance. Three strikes and you're out! Tickets are great for the kids that are doing their stuff. The others do not seem to be phased by not getting tickets for HW completion. I wrote 17 warnings in each class today. That is more than ½ the class for not doing their HW. How hard is it to print the agenda off my website, make sure the two vocabulary pages from last week were done, and do a pre-reading activity and read a story out of our text, an assignment I gave them a heads up on last Tuesday so they could get a jump on it? Geez. They have to bring those warnings back signed tomorrow or face further consequences. I'm tired. Deb- So far, there's no place only dates...July 12-15th. I'll keep you posted on what the onc says to me and you do the same, OK? I'm sorry you're taking pain meds for your legs. Mine aren't that bad. Shoot and eyes, too? I've noticed that as well. I have to use readers when I didn't a few months ago. I know the docs will say it is because I'm in my late 40's , but why so suddenly? Carol - I'm having my labs done this week for hormones too. I see my surgeon and plastic surgeon next week on Monday, so will have the results then. I DVR's Oprah, too, but haven't yet watched it. I'm not surprised at the toxin issue after the massage. I sometimes forget to drink enough water, too. I haven't had a massage in weeks. I need to get back into the swing of doing my more regular massages. I'll have to look at if massage is covered or not under my insurance. D1- Planning our trip via Facebook would be difficult if we can't create a group wouldn't it? So, did you get an estimate yet from the other contractor? $6000 seems like a lot, but then again, I don't know how big the bathroom is either. Have the tiles been chosen? Kathy, glad you found my bolding a good idea. I forgot on my last post. WHoohoo on the almost potty trained young man. What a great idea for a study, and wonderful that you and the dh are participating. I am feeling better today. Finally. Hope you've picked up the last cold of the season. Getting one right after the other sucks. I agree the old immune system is getting a workout. Kath is doing pretty well. She had a little melt down last week, but got it all out for now and feels able to better cope with all that is happening is her world, and not just radiation coming up, but work, pre-menopause crap, and dealing with not having all the energy she wants after her surgery. We all know that feeling, don't we gals? Paula, glad you had a relatively restful weekend and have the peace of mind knowing Ed's sister will be with him while you're at school. So, moving over to FB sounds like an idea you're interested in as well. I'm on board as long as everyone has an account set up, and there is a way to track everything in one place. I haven't used it enough to know what I'm doing. Kathleen, duh, you were talking about our trip to Vegas. I'm sorry. Like Paula said, since we hadn't seen you on the thread before we were confused and thought you'ld posted here accidentally. Do let us know about you. OK, caught up for the evening. SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Jan 27, 2009 09:46PM - edited Jan 27, 2009 09:49PM by SISKimberly So, I got all of my warnings back signed today except for one in each class. That's fabulous!!!!  Only one parent was upset, but only because he was told by his child there would be detention involved for not having handouts printed from the website for this week. I never said that. Only a signature needed so parents know there's a problem with homework not being done.  He says, \"I'm online looking at the website and there are no handouts.\"  It clearly stated on the agenda there were no handouts for this week. Students only needed to print the agenda and have the HW ready for Monday as outlined in the reminder regarding last weeks assignment.  I emailed him back and soooo wanted to say, \" So, I find it interesting that this is the first I've heard from you all year after two Progress Reports and a Report Card showing your son is not passing my class. It appears that being held accountable is what is unacceptable and required contact.\" I didn't.  I did offer him a meeting time for Friday, but haven't gotten a response as of yet.  Geez, the apple apparently doesn't fall far from the tree as the work isn't important to the kid either, only that he got the warning and had to get it signed. Carol- I have glasses everywhere.  The Dean at our school was out to dinner with all the people who wrote the application for the California Distinguished School award, and he had forgotten his glasses, so I loaned him mine.  Purple artistic pattern...hysterical. I gave my blood today, too, for my visit next Monday. Fingers and toes crossed that I'm in heavy duty menopause.  One more month, and I'm at a year without a visit from dear Aunt Flo. WHooHoo!!!!  Last Feb. was a little spotting and that's it, so I figure I need to get through this Feb. to count a full year. D1 -  You Rock my sister friend! An A++++ for you. Going way above and beyond on this assignment!!!!  I was going to mention that once we settled on a few choices to call directly and get the group rate, so yeah for the travel agent sister's sharing of the knowledge and travel agent secrets.  I do not mind walking. It's good for us, and a lot of times you can get from hotel to hotel via shuttle if walking is too difficult for some. Therese - Glad your sis is still willing to train with you and help out with the fundraising for your 3Day.  The Mandalay does have a day spa on site from what I can recall of the information I looked at, so that aught to meet your needs...I'm into the Day Spa idea as well. Pampering all around, please.  Sherry - Look at you all technologicallly plugged in. Awesome.  Nugged? Poked? Hmmm, haven't figured that out yet.  Sounds like the job is going well. I'm glad for you. How are you feeling? Jules - I'm so glad you got home safely. Driving in snow and ice is just so scary, and not always because of your own car not cooperating, but other people driving crazy.  I love going to conferences that really give you stuff you can apply right now. It really makes you excited and rejuvinated, especially this time of year. Deb - Another technologically advanced Jewel. Having the touch I-Pod to check email can't be any more complicated than Face Book.  Like anything, it just takes playing with it to learn what it can do, and I've not played with it hardly at all yet. I have to say that I've been thinking that eventually, I'll want to move away from this site and continue to keep in touch in a non-cancer related way, and FB would be the perfect way to do that in my opinion.   All for now my shining Jewels...Have a great evening.

WhooHoo.  Thank you to all who have said such nice things about my dedication and reminding me that I am touching lives, they just won\u2019t realize it for awhile. So, Carol, may I just say what a fabulous surprise I got in the mail yesterday? Thank you so much, and thank you Norma for giving her the inspiration. My appt. with my onc. was good.  He did laugh at my teasing about drawings and hugs, so I think I\u2019ll keep him. He also did not hesitate to write the letter I need for my Cancer Policy to have the ooph covered as part of my treatment. Deb, as far as the side effects of Taxotere, I still have until the end of May before I can state my se\u2019s are permanent as it can take a full year to get all of the toxins out of your system. My onc did not poopoo my se\u2019s, but did tell me to give my body a little more time. I\u2019m good with that. Carol, I am according to my blood work and my onc. in full post menopause, but there is a small chance my body could revert since I\u2019m so young, yep, you heard me\u2026so young\u2026LOL, which is why he\u2019s recommended the ooph\u2026and because twinsis has now been diagnosed. Both he and Dr. Bobolis, Kath\u2019s onc, really believe there has to be a genetic link. Kath is having the subset of tests done on the BRCA gene, so we should know in three weeks or so. Guess it takes time. Paula- Wow, what a weather crazy winter. The Jelly Belly Factory is about an hour away from my house. Personally, I just can\u2019t eat the sweet stuff anymore, but I know that things like that can become addicting\u2026like the Lays commercials of days gone by, no one can eat just one. LOL So, the parent with the \u2018tude apologized, and another took his place, but my principal is totally backing me up on this one who wants to meet with me and my boss. My boss pulled up the girls report card and she\u2019s failing all of her core subjects, so he\u2019s calling all of those teachers in for a conference with this parent. I love my boss!  The interesting thing is this student is the grandkid of a former colleague and the other middle school I taught at before my school opened. Of all the Jewels here, you certainly have a Free Pass to throw a pity party whenever you need to do so\u2026who wants to have that conversation ever?  ((((HUGS)))) I\u2019m glad that Ed has decided to at least give this until the next MRI and the discussion with the onc. Equally glad that Hospice can offer you all some grief counseling, even if you have to sneak off to do it. Ed isn\u2019t in his usual mind as you know, so something he might have totally agreed with even months ago, isn\u2019t going to be on the menu now. He too is having to really grasp his own mortality, and anger is part of the grieving process. Thinking of you all. sweetie. Therese- Yes!!!! That is exactly what FB is like. Thank you for putting that into words. Stay warm. I love the icicle collection in the freezer. Isn\u2019t it wonderful to experience how kids see things? Yes, even the perspective of being 12 and ½ as being so much older than 12. HeeHee, that is so junior high. I too am good with having my own room if that helps with the price in LV. Jules- Hmmm, a chocolate cake in the oven eh?  Are we doing comfort food or sucking up to the family in order to get some honey-do\u2019s done? LOL  That brown-noser comment from Paula was perfect after the chocolate cake in the oven reference\u2026or am I just really stretching here? Probably. Don\u2019t mind me, sometimes my attempt at humor just bursts into flames before even taking off. Hope you had a quiet day off and that your hubby got home safely....must have as you just posted about the sectional saga. D1- Yeah for getting that big project done. Wow, what a lot of work that must have been, and to have to chase kids down for photos and copy. Your mention of the one girl being verbally abused by her aunt is sad, and your question a good one. How does that happen? How is it that people think it is OK to treat each other with such disrespect? I\u2019ve gotten to 145 and bounce to 147 back and forth, but have been 145 mostly. WhooHoo, so I have lost 10 pounds and the onc\u2019s assistant noticed. Did my onc?  Nope, he\u2019s such a man. All of my female friends have commented.  My issue is that I\u2019m still \u2018flabby\u2019. I\u2019m working out or walking at least 4 times a week. I guess I need to pump it up. I agree that we don\u2019t need to rent a car. They do have public transportation and hotels often have shuttles to and from the airport. That could be a question to ask when finding out the group rate. I agree about the importance of water. I try do drink more than I have in the past, but since I can\u2019t go pee whenever I need to as a teacher, it\u2019s not always easy. I also agree that the idea of putting our trip details on FB, although tempting, is too public. Additionally, I think that I may rethink my decision to be on FB as D1 is right\u2026it is so public, and my sis just told me, as she\u2019s in HR, that people are Googling and finding people\u2019s MySpace and Facebook profiles and reading their pages in order to make hiring decisions. I\u2019m thinking my students could look me up, and that is just weird. And how long will it be before insurance companies or gov\u2019t agencies start using that as a way to get information on people who may innocently say something that would trigger a red flag? Am I being paranoid?  I don\u2019t know, but what is written on a public forum. like this one, is out there for anyone and everyone to see, so it\u2019s important to maintain privacy. Can our FB name not be our own? Maybe a blog like page that requires one to be invited to join in order to read and comment?  I know you have to ask to join FB, but it seems that when you join someone\u2019s, then you read everything other\u2019s have said, too.  OH, Julie to the rescue. Problem resolved. I hope you find some relief from the Tamox se\u2019s. Sounds like you aren't alone here. CHJ \u2013 Sounds like putting the details of our trip via email rather than on our header or FB is an option. We can start an email list like our address and birthday list. Then, the person who has information can send a mass email.  I\u2019d be happy to collect via a PM since I have all the addresses. Some have not sent their b-days, so maybe add that along with phone numbers? I know that when I send my SP something, the delivery often asks for a phone number, and I just have to give them mine which doesn\u2019t help when they\u2019re trying to find someone\u2019s house in another state I\u2019ve never been. Happy Belated BDAY!!!! Deb- I enjoy the slots as well, but I have a limit. Once it\u2019s gone then I\u2019m done. Carla- HI. Who knows, they might be thrilled to be hosting the Jewels, and give us an even better deal, or throw in some other perk.  A front tooth fell out? And it was put back with no drugs? How did that happen? A cap or something? Wendy \u2013 Yeah, another FBer added. Keep warm.  You must be on FB now as I believe you found me. Patty \u2013 I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re having such a rough time. FUSE that Tamox!!!! ((((HUGS)))). Glad you had someone at work to give you a hug and support. Hopin\u2019 the Super Bowl brighten\u2019s your spirits. I know LV is hot in July, but we\u2019ve weathered a lot together as a group, what\u2019s 110 degrees among friends? Just think of it as Lady Luck\u2019s version of a hot flash. I like shows like Ghost Whisperer, Leverage, the Mentalist, Elli Stone before the took it off the aire, Brothers and Sisters, NCIS, and when they were on Six Feet Under and Dead Like Me. I love all kinds of music except music that is so loud I can\u2019t hear the lyrics nor the musical notes because the instruments sound like they\u2019re screaming or the \u2018singers\u2019 actually are screaming. Not fond of RAP either.  Love the theater and dance. Wolves. Enjoy walking, hiking, and biking. Reading a variety of genres. Is that a good start? Kathy \u2013 I understand that hesitation around FB, but with the Jewel site, that might help the dh feel more comfortable. Speaking of comfortable, I hope yours and your ds\u2019 throats are more comfortable from that Strep. Man, you can\u2019t catch a break, can you? Tina \u2013 So, it\u2019s a done deal eh? How soon before escrow closes? Thanks for reminding me, did I thank my SP for my note cards? I think I did, but my brain can\u2019t remember? LJ13, I think you are on to something as I have noticed that my symptoms are related to eating too much grain fiber, not veggie or fruit fiber. Mostly white breads, cracker, and the like when I\u2019m eating out or at a friends house for example. Whoo Hoo on the last Herceptin!!!!! Kris- Yeah, another Jewel on FB. Joan, no worries about not doing your HW. It looks like everyone is on board for Mandalay Bay, so the fact you checked out the site is awesome!!! Awe Maz, that SUCKS.  We are all here for you sending lots of positive thoughts. Hate surgery? Can\u2019t think of a single Jewel who wouldn\u2019t second that! I think the BGP\u2019s are available\u2026Carol? Man that was a lot to catch up with. Sorry for the novel. Have a good Sat. I\u2019m going to a concert tonight with the dh and a friend from school. SIS Kimberly PS Kathleen, sorry rads is kicking your butt. As we are fond of saying here\u2026FUSE F. U. side effects.  Hang in there.  PSS My twinsis Kathleen is starting rad the second week in February.",

The node thing-3 of 34 is not a bad number at all considering the percentage of positive to negative, 9% neg to 91% pos...in my profession you've earned yourself an A. ;-) I have 4 of 10, but even with 40% to 60%, I'm sure between the chemo and radiation that will take care of any lingering cells. You'll be fine, sweetie, I'm sure of it. I'm wondering why they took so many nodes. Did your surgeon do the blue dye sentinal node test while you were in surgery? I knew I had a tumor-in situ in my nodes, so I knew some would be removed, but the test apparently showed her that only 10 needed to be tested. I suppose if more had come up positive, I'd have had to go back in for more lymph removal-thank goodness I passed by the skin of my teeth with a 60%. :-) Welcome WVgirl and SheShe48. OK, so Miss Acronym, here, has more to learn. What is ANB and SNB? JJ? How did you get hooked into the medical trial SheShe? Got my treatment option- my cocktail-to be referred to from now on as my chemo-tini- is a combination of Taxotere, Adriamycin, and Cyclophosphamide (TAC). I'll start soon after the new year, but won't know until next week exactly what day-the oncologists office needs to get approval from my insurance company. Radiation will follow that daily for 4 to 6 weeks. Take care my sweet sisters. Your SIS(Sister In Survival) Kimberly",

Sherry, I'm sorry I messed up on your treatment/surgery....glad you're getting all hooked up in the wig and boob department...It's good to hear a smile in your posts after previous worried ones. :-) My cocktail is the same as yours with Taxotere added. I go for 6 rounds once every 3 weeks, then radiation after that...when, still don't know. Carol, no, the oncologist's office and I never connected. We played phone tag, and I think perhaps they weren't there yesterday or something. So, I doubt chemo will start for me next week unless they call me on Monday to set things up. I do get another 100cc's added on the 3rd...it's like reliving my puberty all over again...only in fast forward...flat for two weeks, to small mounds for two weeks...to who knows what Thursday will bring...I like the idea of being able to decide what size I want to be, and getting to live with a size for a few weeks is like taking them for a test drive... :-) For those of you exercising...how long past surgery are you? My bilat was three weeks ago this past Thursday. I have taken some walks, but it's been so darned cold and raining. I should be able to drive soon, so I'll have to take myself to the gym and use the treadmill. Vettagal, I am sooooo hearing you on the sleeping on your side thing. My right side is a bit easier than the left, but still only for very short periods of time...the left is just not cooperating at all...painful. I know it will come in time...have to keep up the stretching excercises...but I'm impatient. Steroid question....why do some of us have to use them and others do not? I'm not liking the weight gain side effect nor the wired feeling. I have to take Deca...something according to my onc the day before, the day of, and the day after...whenever that is. Diana, let us know about this trial as you progress. What is the purpose of the trial? WVGirl-The port site should be healed within 10 to 14 days.

Do be mindful your body is trying to heal...so going to school and work plus trying to heal is what is causing you to feel so tired...not lack of exercise. I'm not saying if you feel up to it not to exercise...just be mindful of your body's desire to heal and how much energy that takes...and yes, we do chat we gals...thankfully. Don't know how we'd get through this if we didn't. D1/OLE(Our Leader Extraordinare)-WhooHoo on your daughter's time on the floor and the win!!!! Made climbing up those bleachers...and back down worth it eh? Wvgirl-glad all is still well...hope you are able to sleep better tonight. Diana63- sorry to hear you're feeling achy...hope that clears up soon...but the good news...no nausea! AZ Deb- Yes , we do start the same day. I already have my port...got it the same day as my bilat 12/6. I look forward to hearing how your experience goes...you'll have 20 weeks total...I'll only have 18, but then I get to do RADs afterwards. BREAKFAST...yep, got to have some now...my tummy is growling...it's 9:40 already. Man time flies when you're chatting away. Sorry you aren't feeling well, AZ Donna. Hope you got the rest and relief you needed going back to bed. T-shirt slogan: January Jewels...Sisters In Survival... with the breast cancer ribbon of course...on black t-shirts with hot pink ink.

Rhinestones are perfect....just the right look at me touch. :-) I haven't even looked at wigs or thought about hats and scarves past the thought...I'm going to shave my head rather than watch all of my hair fall out everywhere like I'm shedding or something...\"Oh, pardon that clump of hair that just fell into my soup...chemo\" :-) I'm looking forward to hearing all about your Look Good Feel Good class....I haven't had any info on classes as of yet...maybe at my first chemo tomorrow I'll get that info. Thanks in advance for sharing. Carol- Thanks for taking on the whole t-shirt quest. Vettegal-Good luck with your first FULL day back at work. I'm just aching for you thinking about how much you'll have to use your arm...mine were aching yesterday by the end of the day, and I wasn't working. Just lifting my soup spoon to my mouth...went out to lunch with the dh... was ouchy. Oh, and about starting your period, going back to work fulltime, and catching a cold...melt downs are allowed. You've had good news lately and a lot of fun with new wigs... think of it this way...you're getting all of this unpleasant stuff out of the way all at the same time instead of one thing right after the other...and you can't really appreciate those good times without these little crappy ones...does that help? Cliches are always good for times like this. HaHaHa Well, I'm off to eat something as I start my Decodron today....and can't take it on an empty tummy. And oh, I can't have coffee (whine)...I'm drinking peppermint tea...it's good, but it just isn't the same. I am so blaming my caffeine withdrawals on prechemo SEs. FUSE!

You guys ROCK!!! So far, still only slight nausea...not even bad...a weird taste in my mouth, but not metalic like...just swish with Biotene wash after meals and that seems to help. Drinking lots of water and tea. I ate four small meals yesterday...just not really hungry, but no I should eat. I'm supposed to experience the potential Decadron crash...but I'm saying I don't want to do that, so I'm just not going to do it. So there. I could also experience achiness and flu like syptoms in the next day or so, from the C part of my cocktail and the Neulasta, but again, I'm saying don't want to...and so far nothing like that has occured...as far as 8:49am that is. ;-) KathyL-How's dad doing? How are you holding up? Carol- I'm going to need an extra large with the potential for shrinkage wouldn't you think? Good luck today Carol. Hope your cold is under control, and you do well. D1/OLE- I'm glad you've found comfort in my reminder that you've done all the tests you needed and that non-cancerous stuff was found, and this could just be more of that 'doesn't feel right' stuff. Thanks for the reminders about eating small meals and all. We are so lucky to have you and others who have gone before us to give us a flashlight and guidebook. How you doing, Deb102307. Has anyone heard from SheShe lately? How did things go yesterday, My3girls? If I've missed anyone, sorry.

I'm a week out as of yesterday, and the SE's were not too bad the first few days, days 3 and 4 were worse-with 4 being the worst, and then it's just been getting better each day. Of course, not everyone will have the same experience, so all you can do is belly up to the bar...ask for a chemotini at Club Survival and then buy your ticket to The Side Effects Circus and anticipate what acts will featured. OK, has anyone experience pain opening their mouth? There are no sores, but it feels like the soft pallet tissue is just being stretched all to heck...I could barely get my mouth around my sandwich yesterday. Also, my ears feel full...probably drainage...blowing my nose a lot... I don't think it's a cold- clear mucus- or anything as I don't feel sick like that. I'm getting my labs done today. I'm hoping my numbers are good so I can go to school on Friday. My short term sub is leaving...and my long term sub takes over after the three day weekend...so I wanted to thank her for taking care of my kids...say hey to my kids...and pack up a few things in my classroom,so Nick can make it more his own since he'll be there the rest of the year.

I am so ready for next time. Glad you're fairing well so far. My SE's hit day 3 and 4 with 4 being the WORST...then 5 started feeling better...and each day better and better. My nose runs a bit...my soft palet is painful when I open my mouth wide enough to eat a sandwich, but no sores...and on top of it all hemoroids from hell. Oh, and I can't taste things very well. Some of my favorite things...can't taste them...Sigh;-( AZDeb- Thanks for the pep talk, but I'm so not worried about my hair...I actually was giving PALady a pep talk about not worrying about losing her hair today...I did go get my wig today as I know it's getting close to the fall out...and I so want to have a shaving my head party!!!! YOU ROCK D1...I love your pictures!!!!! You are a beautiful baldascious babe.

Keep us posted....we're here. vettegal-so glad you're feeling better...just in time for a chemotini...We should all buy pharmecuetical stocks with all the stuff we have to buy to fight the SE's not to mention the stuff we get infused. D1/ OLE- OMG!!! I'm so glad you're OK...and second...OMG what a frustrating morning you had!!!! YOur poor DH must have been beside himself. No wonder you needed wine dinner. I can't taste so many things that I'm afraid to try wine for fear it will be bad and then it will ruin it for me. I think I'll just wait until the taste buds come back. Maybe I'll drink Pomegranite Martini's...if I ruin those...no big deal. I got my wig today...my sister and I had a great time picking it out together. I wasn't happy with the turban thing either, but bought one to sleep in to keep my head warm...suggested by the shop gals. My hubby just got back from Vegas, so I'm off to spend some time with my darling man. Night all, SIS KImberly",

No alcohol recommended for me as well...but recommended sounds like a suggestions...but I haven't had a drink for 10 days as of last night...I sound like I'm at an AA meeting :-0 Anyway, haven't really craved a drink, but will want to raise a glass next Wed. when we finally get to celebrate my older sister's bday belatedly due to her hectic work schedule. I'm going for a drink I'm not really attached to like a martini of some kind...I just can't take the chance of ruining my taste for wine. I'm drinking what should be coffee this morning...but it doesn't even taste good, so I probably won't even finish it. Sigh!!!! CarolC- Man, gotta love how the one hand doesn't know what the other one is doing!!!! I hadn't thought about insurance hassels as an SE...good way of looking at it. FUSE!!!!!!! D1 and Vettegal- I just saw the previews for the Dexter show...I think that's what it's called...with the gay brother from Six Feet Under? I loved Six Feet Under. It looks like one I'm going to like. I'm hooked on the Law and Order, CSI, NCIS, Cold Case etc... kinds of shows...have been since I was a kid watching Quincy. My husband tires of them, so I have to DVR them and watch when he isn't around. I also really like Medium, Ghost Whisperer, and Moonlight( is that the name? about the vampire). Good luck DianaB...sending positive vibes your way!!!! Big ((((HUGS)))) to all of you who underwent chemo this week, who are experiencing SE's, hasseling with insurance companies or getting the tx down. Have a great weekend! Hey, Kathy and Carol, you must have been posting at the same time I was...glad to here from you both...I got the Miralax too...it's ready for the next go round. Kathy, I think the Taxol needs to just start slow...that's what my nurses did the first time...they did it really slow for 20 minutes then speeded it up...it took over an hour and a 1/2 for that puppy. I'm going to make sure they do the same thing this next time. SIS Kimberly",

We got to the salon and met my gal. Sydney has been doing my hair forever...at least 14 years. When she first started my 'haircut', you should have seen the faces of the newbies...I'm sure they were wondering what the heck I was thinking...but as we laughed and took pictures at each stage they caught on and pretty soon I had anyone who wasn't with a client watching my transformation. It was great!!! I will post pics as soon as my hubby downloads them from the camera and I set up that photobucket acct. Went to lunch afterwards, then after she dropped me off, I went up to Auburn to see another friend of mine who had to take a half day off from school to wait for the Dish Network guy to show up between 1 and 5pm. We visited for awhile, and I've just arrived home. DianeB- Hope you have few Se's with CMF...Carol is here to guide you through if you need guidance and support. LJ13- Glad that Herceptin is in your corner. Losing weight on purpose or due to treatment? I admire your spunk girl working out even when you don't feel 100%. D1- Great advice for a gift idea for Kathy's kids. And Kathy- Wow, that sucks the big one!!!! I certainly hope that your counts go up quickly so you can go home. We always knew you were one in a million...that one that challenges the odds. Get well soon and get home to your bed, your kids, and your dh where you'll actually get some rest. Hospitals are not the most restful places to be. Vettegal- Glad it went well today even if you did have to wait. First one down, girl!!!! Jenn51- Don't beat yourself up about the Se's...we all wanted to breeze through them, but it is what it is...just take good care of yourself by listening to your body and taking your meds. Welcome Sunshine 99 Sista- Glad you've come through tx 1 fairly unscathed. As I just said to Jenn51...take care of yourself by listening to your body and taking your meds. Paula- How sweet of your students to be so thoughtful!!! Joan- I'm a teacher,too. I know what you mean about missing them. I teach 7th/8th grade Language Arts. I am so sorry to hear about your Mom. That must be rough on everyone. Is she able to have a nice care facility paid for with her insurance? That will certainly alleviate having to worry about her falling in her own home with no one there. Of course, if she can afford to stay home and have a home health nurse coming in to care for her that would help her to have familiar surroundings. My grandfather stayed with us his last 6 months. He was in assisted living, but when he could no longer walk or get himself in and out of bed, he couldn't stay there anymore. He was able to afford help during the day while we worked, then we took the night shift. I'm glad you have two sisters who can really jump in and take this on while you take care of you...or at least I hope they'd do that. My thoughts are with you and your family as you work things out. Take care Jewels...sleep well for those of you entering evening...have a great day for those of you who will rise before I will on the West coast. SIS KImberly",

Of course, I have been contemplating writing a Baldacious Babe poem...it just hasn't quite formed yet. Happy 57th...no way!!!!...a little early.

My fingers and toes are crossed for you. Your hospital food certainly isn't going to be anywhere near as good as D1/OLE(Our Leader Extraordinare)'s homecooked coconute curried chicken, but at least it will give your body some needed fuel to build more blood cells.

I have just been diagnosed 10/10/07 with infiltrating ductal carcinoma. My father had breast cancer and prostate cancer, and my mom died of pancreatic cancer...all related to the BRCA2 gene as is ovarian cancer.

I got a lot done today anticipating tomorrow Decadron crash. Worked out for about 20 minutes, went grocery shopping, had my Neulasta shot and saw my oncologist. Carol, he doesn't even want to discuss the hysterectomy idea until have treatment is over and we come the point where we need to decide how to proceed with the hormones. I'm OK with that...one step at a time. After that, I went shopping for a pair of sunglasses, sat on mine, and some new socks. I found a cute shirt, too. I wore a scarf out today and actually had a gal ask where I got it. I then met a teacher friend at Starbucks for a decaf after she got out of school for the day. I got home around 5:30pm. Kathy- I know that ten pounds at the top end seems like a lot, but you'll get back to normal. I have faith that when the time comes that you're ready to commit to losing that weight, you'll do it. You've kind of been busy and had lots on your plate...I mean that figuratively of course. And, you are not a bad mom wanting some alone time to just get things done. We've all been there! Hope you got some peace and quiet once the little darlings were in bed. About gas...my father in law, who passed away from cancer three years ago, used to say...Better out there in this big old world than inside little ole me! Your grandpa and my father in law would have gotten along great!!!! CHJ-Hysterical balditude story!!!! WVgirl- That's what friends are for, sweetie. And like Carol said, Miralax is over the counter, so you don't need a prescription. Vettegal- Vent away!!!!! Better here where we all know what you're talking about!!!! I am so sorry to hear the se's are keeping you down...and without pay has got to hurt. Is the dh able to get any extra hours in to cover the loss? Too bad you can't work from home on days you can't go in to the office. Is there no way to have your computer at home and take your calls from home? It will be a nice treat to see flowers on your desk when you do get back to work, though. Like my poem said, my scalp was sore by day 8, and hair starting to fall out by day 11. Bob Evans....must be an East Coast thing. At least you can taste that. My buds came back week three, but now I'm readying myself for their loss again. Whine!!!! FUSE!!!! sista2- What wonderful news all the way around!!!! WhooHoo!!! The se's won't last forever...just a few more days and things will be looking up! You'll be glad you did this chemo thing...it's just one more defense against recurrance...not 100% guarentee, but better than the odds without it. Welcome Kris. Glad you could join us...postive and psycho...you'll fit in just fine!!!! If you haven't had a chance to go back and read our posts, you might want to in order to get all the wonderful advice, support, and goofiness...and there are t-shirts for the JJ's. Maz- How wonderful that your son is doing well in his drug treatment program. We did a family intervention when my dad was 67. He was addicted to alcohol and marijuana. We sent him to St. Helena and he's been clean and sober for 3 years now. He thanks us for the intervention now--hated us at the time---and stated if he'd only known how good life could be without his addictions, he would have stopped sooner. Of course lots of counseling and learning about why he felt he needed to numb out wasn't easy, but we're so proud of him. I wish the same success for your boy. Going topless isn't so bad. I actually find it rather empowering as my poem on Balditude on the previous page mentions. I do have alternative things I wear...baseball hat, a scarf, my wig...but prefer whenever possible to just be au natural. Sheebas- I'm so glad you had a good experience at your cancer center the first time around. Yeah, the Red Devil is a little anxiety provoking isn't it? But just remember, these drugs are your chemotini...it's kicking your cancer's butt. Think of it as a cleansing rather than a poisoning. And you will so not be here alone at the end...this group is here for the long haul. We've got gals doing radiation after chemo and of course hormone choices to make...A year from now, we will still be talking to eachother and celebrating the success we've had...complaining about the se's of chemopause or hormone therapy...talking about breast reconstruction...No worries my dear...we're here for you. D1- Must have been posting when I was composing. Loved the pizza guy story. Your wit always cracks me up. Hope Sunshine, Deb3, and Joan did OK today. AZDonna, JackieB, and Jenn51...are up tomorrow. We're with you gals. Good night Jewels, SIS Kimberly",

Made it to Frankie Valli last night...good concert, but I wasn't the best company...everyone was very understanding about my unusual lack of \"pep\". I've read all the posts, but just can't bring myself to type more than I'm thinking of you all. Our newbies, no longer virgins, to those of you coming into good days after last week's infusions, for those of us dealing with se's after this week's infusions, and to good news about Dana's insurance... Dana and WVgirl- I can't even imagine going through this without the support of my dh. I am so sorry that you are both in relationships where your men are just clueless. You both deserve to be loved and cherished...do whatever you need to do to take care of yourselves emotionally, spiritually, physically, and mentally. Dana, sounds like you've got a plan...good for you. Good luck Paula...and hopefully Deb (is that right?) Wow, PALady, you look great!!!! Great pics. SIS Kimberly",

I wanted a burger, so I stupidly went to Wendy\u2019s-I never eat fast food, but it sounded good for whatever reason. OK, huge disappointment. I ordered a burger, small fries, and a root beer. I haven\u2019t had root beer since I was a kid\u2026the burger and fried were practically tasteless and the root beer was awful! I\u2019m sure it was my tastebuds as it\u2019s normally too sweet for me\u2026this was bitter. So, lesson learned. My body knows best\u2026don\u2019t eat the fast food! Sharon- Welcome back. You\u2019re almost done all ready? Wow, time does fly doesn\u2019t it? Congrats on that part. I\u2019m glad we can be here for you when the sibs aren\u2019t able to relate. Keep us posted. D1- I was so rooting for the Giants\u2026I always vote for the underdog. Congrats on the bragging rights!!!! My stubble was sensitive, too. Like I said earlier though, I\u2019m looking more like Uncle Fester than GI Jane. ARDeb-I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve had a sucky few days. I hear you on that one. No way you\u2019re a whiney baby\u2026you feel like c%*p\u2026you have a right to whine a little. Get some rest, sweetie\u2026it really helps. Julie-You poor thing\u2026 I agree that you need to talk to your onc about the meds he\u2019s giving you because obviously they aren\u2019t working. I\u2019m Taxotere, Adriamycin, and Cytoxin, and I get Aloxi and other anti-nausea drugs with my cocktail. I haven\u2019t felt really nauseous or like I needed to vomit at all. I also agree that you need to take time off to just take care of yourself. I know taking a 30% hit will be hard, but your health is so much more important. Cathy gave you some good advice about calling your creditors if you can\u2019t make your budget work on 70% of your salary. (((HUGS))) AZDonna- Man, we\u2019ve had a lot of se casualties this time around. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out of bed and heading towards semi-human. What a wonderful gift from our dh to have a maid come in and do all the housework including the laundry. He\u2019s earned the Gold Star Award for this week for sure. Vettegal- How proud I feel to have coined the phrase your husband feels so relates to us, Jewels!!! And glad you\u2019re feeling able to work\u2026a SHERO\u2026(along with all of you who are working and being moms to kids at home) I can\u2019t even imagine having to work through this or take care of little ones or teenagers right now. Kathy- I\u2019m so glad you had a \u2018normal\u2019 day. I got my TB shot and then took myself to the mall to find some pretty scarves\u2026couldn\u2019t get in to see the gal for my wig until tomorrow. Hope your pre-chemo blood work comes out well tomorrow. Welcome Peggy-Make sure you provide your info to D1, so she can add you to our list of Jewels. So, it sounds like you started in Jan. and go for round #2 soon. You\u2019ve come to the right place. PM Carol(golfer) if you want a t-shirt. She needs 6 people to start another run\u2026and I think she\u2019s getting close. Speaking of which, my Large is too big even after washing it, so I\u2019ll order a Medium, Carol. Can you PM me your address again, and I\u2019ll send another check. If anyone wants a Large, I\u2019m willing to donate it to you as my gift. Sleep well Jewels, SIS Kimberly",

I took some Ibuprophin this morning, and that seemed to help. Note to self, take at bedtime! This morning, the dh and I went to sign papers on an investment property we\u2019re buying so our college son can live there- why keep paying his rent if we can get a tax write off\u2026and he can live off the rent from roomies. His lease is up at the end of March, so this worked out perfectly. Then I did my weekly labs. Kathy- I so went for the red\u2026it\u2019s awesome. Everyone at the shop just raved how great the color was on me. My first wig is more blonde, I guess\u2026and now that I\u2019ve got the red, I\u2019m liking it better\u2026Maybe, with different wardrobe choices one over the other will be the choice of the day. D1- I like going au natural around the house or out for a walk or to the store with a ball cap on, but I also have found a few tres chic scarves that are really fun. The wigs are more for fun. I have a cap I wear under my wig so it doesn\u2019t itch. My gal also took tucks in the cap to fit my head\u2026if it doesn\u2019t fit well it can ride up or slip. She also cut it to fit the style I wanted. Bless your heart for being the Snack Bar Mom\u2026I recall working the snack bar when my son was in high school\u2026and that was fun and all, but I can\u2019t even imagine making sure everything was there that was needed, that the shifts were covered, etc\u2026 Oh well, don\u2019t feel too badly about showing up topless at school\u2026embarrassing our children is part of the privilege of being a parent. God knows there are times our children have embarrassed us. When my son was little, he asked an older woman why she was so old\u2026OK, I was deeply embarrassed and apologized to her\u2026she laughed and told him she was so old because she lived a good life and laughed a lot. Whew!!!! It could have been ugly. Bummer about the potential lymphodema. Keep us posted. I still have swelling on my left side under my arm\u2026I wonder if that\u2019s a problem. I\u2019ll have to ask my doc when I see him next week. Glad this infusion went better. Here's to hoping the added steroids help the bone pain. Diane- Both my dad and twin were BRCA negative, so I\u2019m feeling safe enough to say I am negative as well. I\u2019m sorry that the change in tx has you down. Hang in there. Hope your child gets well and that you don\u2019t catch whatever it is. Julie- I will definitely be talking to you if I decide to do the hysterectomy. I agree with the other Jewels that your oncologist has to help you get a handle of this\u2026are you having a reaction to one or a combination of those drugs? Is it dietary? I don\u2019t blame you for dreading the next tx, who wouldn\u2019t after your horrid reaction each time? Glad you\u2019re feeling better now\u2026enjoy the good days. Sorry you couldn\u2019t sleep\u2026I was up too, with bone pain. I should have gotten up and checked in. Vettagal- My plastic surgeon and my oncologist say that it takes at least the same number of months you were in treatment to feel \u2018normal\u2019 again\u2026so I\u2019m saying when you have the good days\u2026celebrate!!!! You and your dh sound like you have fun together\u2026that\u2019s great! Bummer about your work blocking you from the site. I wonder if when I go back to work, I\u2019ll be blocked. It\u2019s a school, so the word \u2018breast\u2019 will probably throw up the FireWall pretty fast. HaHaha Dana- Everything always works out as they should\u2026sounds like you got yourself a great oncologist. BRAVO\u2026and good luck with your first infusion. Joan- You went to work on Day 6? Man, I was so laid out\u2026I can\u2019t even imagine. Glad you made it through\u2026listen to your body\u2026you need to rest as much as you can\u2026and watch those germs\u2026your immune system is vulnerable. wvgirl- I\u2019m glad your Look Good Feel Better class went well, but mostly that you\u2019ve been invited to a support group. That is great!!!! Sounds like you need to be thinking about yourself and what you really want in your life from this point forward\u2026you deserve to be loved and supported\u2026not treated like you\u2019re not a valuable human being. If your DH thinks more of the dog than he does of you, maybe he and the dog need to find another place to live\u2026maybe the dog house? Sometimes it takes a big event to show us who and what really matters in this life. Your brother\u2026a big matters\u2026your DH, doesn\u2019t matter at this point since he chooses not be there for you when you most need him. Wasn\u2019t that part of the marriage vows\u2026in sickness and in health? If this were him\u2026the one who was sick\u2026I\u2019ll bet he\u2019d be expecting the world from you\u2026and I\u2019ll bet you would have been there for him. Sorry, didn\u2019t mean to sound preachy\u2026it just makes me so mad that you have to deal with this. CarolC- Well, gosh\u2026thanks! I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve enjoyed my writing. About the wig, once you get your wig cut the way you would normally wear it\u2026shorter bangs, thin out heavy spots, etc\u2026it makes a world of difference. Also, getting the cap tucked if needed so it fits your head helps. Peg- A bet huh? Hope the stakes are high enough to buy you a great wig or some great hats or something. Tina- Welcome. You sound like a positive bundle of fun\u2026you are so going to fit right in with us...So, tx 2 kicked your butt, too? I\u2019m on TAC every 21 days, so even though yours is separated\u2026same se effect. What a great thing your employer lets you work exclusively from home!!!! LJ13- OK, good news and bad. Good news is a lower dose of Taxol for 12 instead of 8 with hopefully lesser se\u2019s\u2026bad news that Herceptin will be another full year after once each week. That\u2019s a time commitment for sure, but from what I\u2019ve heard\u2026a really good drug for HER2 positive gals. What se\u2019s are expected from the Herceptin? ARDeb-Hang in there\u2026you got the right attitude\u2026only one more AC, then just Taxol. Hope your bath and good night\u2019s sleep boosts your energy for tomorrow. sunshine- Glad to hear from you...sounds like you're pulling out of the fog a bit. To all who have had/ will have tx 2/6 and 2/7\u2026don\u2019t forget your chemotini glass and Supergirl cape\u2026I know, I\u2019ve got to get my dh to post my pics for me again. I\u2019ll check in again tomorrow, SIS Kimberly",

Good for you having a girl\u2019s day, and feeling so good while doing it is just icing on the cake\u2026chocolate cake!!!! What a sweetheart of a dh you\u2019ve got yourself\u2026a man who is in touch with his emotions is a rare thing. JKiss- ((((HUGS))))) Oh, sweetie, I am so sorry you\u2019ve had such a rough road this year and cancer on top of it all. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate right now. I\u2019m sorry your dh isn\u2019t the emotional support you need right now. Like wvgirl and Dana, it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s much of a surprise to you, but now you\u2019re seeing that having a true equal partner is important\u2026a shift in thinking and priorities...not always an easy realization. Do you have other people around to support you? Family or friends near by who can help you with your daughter, give you hugs, and help you with things when you\u2019re just worn out? I wish there was more I could do for you, wvgirl, and Dana than give your virtual (((HUGS))) and tell you I\u2019m here for you. No need to apologize for expressing yourself here. It\u2019s OK to have break downs and to grieve the loss of your breast, your dog, your dreams of your life in your new house, your hopes that in an extreme hardship your husband would be some emotional support\u2026 grieve it\u2026and let it go. What can I do today to make my life what I need and want it to be? I can consider reconstructive surgery to replace my breast. I can look long and hard at our finances and create a budget we can live within. I can express to my husband how much I need him and understand this has been a rough year on him, too, but that we need to pull together rather than pushing each other away. I can reach out to friends, family, my church, or community resources for assistance. I can cry, cry, and cry some more to cleanse my spirit. Just remember\u2026you are a survivor\u2026a real SHERO for taking everything on that you have. Paula- Oh, you know me so well. I had a great time at the ballet. We had dinner first, then off to the show. The Sacramento Ballet does three pieces each performance: one more traditional, the main attraction, and a more contemporary piece. They did such a fabulous job with Street Car Named Desire\u2026sets, costumes, character development, choreography\u2026brilliant. How sweet of the ladies at your childhood church to make you a quilt, and for you dad to bring it by. That\u2019s just love expressing itself all over the place, isn\u2019t it? You know, my wig gals had never heard anyone say their stubble hurt\u2026when I told them mine got really stiff like I\u2019d hair sprayed it to death, and then started to \u2018hurt\u2019 and fall out, they were surprised. Here's to good numbers and getting to attend the competition with your kids!!!! Carol-Yeah, I\u2019ve always been a go go gal, so when I have a good day, I\u2019m getting all I can out of it. I, of course, could spend more time exercising\u2026but going to lunch, window shopping, the ballet, to school for a visit, and even doing my lab work every week is so much more fun in my book. Now that the weather is getting so nice\u2026I have to just get out and walk every day\u2026although I need to start doing some strength training\u2026my muscles are practically non-existent it seems. Me, too on the libido thing\u2026but (OK, if you don\u2019t want to read this\u2026skip to the next paragraph) my dh is so wonderful about getting me into the mood if you know what I mean. Once the pump is primed, I\u2019m ready\u2026maybe not as athletic as before, but gets the job done\u2026oh yeah. However, I do know that he\u2019d like sex more often than he\u2019s getting it. OK, it\u2019s safe now to continue reading ladies. Julie- I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re tired after your first big outing in days. Glad you took time to just rest and get prepared for your time off to heal. Man, isn\u2019t getting lesson plans done for such a long time a bear? I had to divvy up my Dept. Chair duties as well, although we aren\u2019t allowed to do evaluations in CA\u2026our administrators have to do it. How funny that my sub is a man, too. He used to be my student 10 years ago\u2026it was great to pass my class on to someone I know will do a great job, and at the same time so hard. I miss my kids so much. Tina- Hey, good to hear from you. And lazing in bed with the cat and the TV sounds good to me\u2026and how sweet your dh came in to eat with you. Hey, when you\u2019re feeling up to it energy wise\u2026relive one of those earlier-time moments with the dh\u2026just because we\u2019re older and have bc doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have a little fun now and again. He\u2019d love it, for sure. Great words of wisdom for Dana and JKiss. Hope you have a better se day. So, with number 3 done, you\u2019re almost done with AC, then onto Taxotere. CathyCA- You know, I say as long as you can live with it and it looks good, don\u2019t worry about it. I didn\u2019t worry about it until it started coming out in clumps. Have a great time at your friends 50th!!!! SheShe- Well, there you are!!!! I was wondering if you went on vacation without us or something. So sorry it wasn\u2019t a tropical island escape, but a sinus infection. Don\u2019t be too hard on the regular doc\u2026sinus infections aren\u2019t always easy to diagnose if your mucus isn\u2019t an awful color like yellow or green the day you go in\u2026I\u2019ve experienced that before, and a day later my mucus was all of a sudden a pukey color, and I was on antibiotics. With the flu going around, docs don\u2019t want to prescribe antibiotics willy-nilly. On the other hand, being a chemo patient, he might have been a bit more diligent. Glad the onc took care of it. Take care of yourself\u2026hope the xray comes back clean. Well, have a wonderful day ladies. I\u2019ll check in on you tonight. SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Feb 15, 2008 09:13AM - edited Feb 15, 2008 09:22AM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels- Boy, you gals were chatty yesterday and this morning already. I didn\u2019t have time to get back online yesterday. I went to the oncologist, and I asked him about the eye watering thing. He thinks I need to check with an eye doc to make sure my tear ducts aren\u2019t blocked as that happens sometimes with chemo. When that occurs the tears have nowhere to go but down your face. He explained that tears normally drain down the back of the throat, which I didn\u2019t know. My onc is this slight East Indian fellow with a broad grin. He cracked me up when I told him I didn\u2019t know that about the tear ducts by saying, \u201cThey don\u2019t tell you these things on ER or that show with Dr. McDreamy do they?\u201d So afterwards, I went to the store to get groceries\u2026hadn\u2019t done that with a new fridge arriving\u2026just didn\u2019t replace things. Got home put the groceries away, had a late lunch, then began to set the mood for the evening\u2026pre-set the table and prepared my salmon (a little lemon zest, herbs, sea salt, a little butter, and bay leaves wrapped in foil) so it was ready to just pop in the oven. I pre-made the salad, too, so all I had to do was add the dressing at the last minute. I called my hubby around 6pm to check his ETA\u2026needed to reapply the make-up that had been washed off my face with my poor watery eyes\u2026get dressed and put on the red wig. Right afterwards, my gf calls to tell me a funny student story. The social studies classes had two Tibetan monks as guest speakers\u2026they are doing a healing mandalla at a local park. Through an interpreter, they explained about life in the monistary and how monks ranged in age from 5 years old on up. The kids asked questions like \u201cAre there women at the monestary?\u201d \u201cCan monks marry?\u201d and then this kids asks, \u201cIf you can\u2019t get married, where do the baby monks come from?\u201d(apprarently not understanding that the young monks came to them from families rather than being born into the monestary)\u2026she said it was hysterical to see those monks cracking up. So, my dh got home around 6:30, and I greeted him by asking if he\u2019d like to have dinner with a sexy red head tonight\u2026he loved the wig!!!! After dinner we exchanged cards. I have been writing a story based on my Ode to My Body poem. My stepmother is a writer and has encouraged me to write it and submit it to be published in a friend\u2019s annual Hot Flashes anthology\u2026It\u2019s an anthology of erotic stories\u2026not pornographic\u2026subtle innuendo. Anyway, I included the story in his card. He asked me to read it to him. As I was reading, he started to cry. When I was done reading, he told me it was beautiful and gave me the biggest hug. It was the best Valentines Day!!!!!! Oh, and I could taste the wine\u2026WHOOHOOO!!!! A glass of Pinot with dinner and a small glass of Petite Syrah with the chocolate. Now that I\u2019m done bragging about my fabulous day\u2026I am so sorry to hear of those of you who were suffering se\u2019s yesterday and today. Hopefully, you got a smile from my chronicles at the very least. D1- About the spasms\u2026I\u2019ll pay more attention\u2026I know I experienced bone pain after the NastyLasta last time, and I felt like I was going to start my period\u2026back labor kind of pain. It lasted a few days, but Ibuprofin helped. LOL on the wig story. OOOOHHH, a massage. How lovely!!!! Have a great weekend with the college girl. PALady- Glad you stopped in to say hey!!!! And yeah on feeling good!!!!! Kathy- Just say NO to the cold\u2026but with little rugrats running around it\u2019s not easy keeping those little germs at bay. Hope it\u2019s not a bad cold. And isn\u2019t it frustrating when the computer goes down and requires a fix like a new router? It must have been like being thrown into solitary confinement not being able to get email, talk with the Jewels, and surf the web. Glad you didn\u2019t have to hurt the repair man. I got some cream called Elta Lite made for people with diabetes and other dry skin issues. It\u2019s great moisture replacement\u2026I\u2019m using that on my face to sooth the skin\u2026nice!!!! It\u2019s good for sensitive skin and doesn\u2019t clog pores. I saw it on a site that sells items to gals on chemotherapy\u2026wigs, hats, bras etc\u2026 but got it at Raleys in the pharmacy section. What good news...a new baby...and how sweet your dd feels a bond all ready sharing the 13th day of a month. LJ13 and Kathy- I eat applesauce everyday so I have something in my tummy before taking my vitamins and probiotic. I don\u2019t think it has caused me to have the runs\u2026although I do have loose stools at times. Vettegal- What a great card to get from your real estate agent. Was this someone you\u2019ve known or someone you just found as you were looking for a house? Either way\u2026how thoughtful of her. Thanks for sharing the sentiment. Sista2- You put the whole baldness proclaiming our circumstances and how others react so well!!!! Bravo, and I totally agree with you. Although I know we all have different circumstances as far as work, I\u2019m still amazed, as I\u2019ve said before, that so many of you continue to work...SHEROS!!!! That is awful about the college shooting. It\u2019s just beyond me why people choose to take other\u2019s lives because they are so unhappy and/or angry. It saddens me that we hear about this kind of rampage more and more. What is wrong with people that this is even an option? Carol- I\u2019ve been colder these days, too. I think part of it is being bald\u2026no hair to keep the heat in\u2026but that the other part is circulation like you said. The pooper isn\u2019t cooperating eh? I get it that your feeling pretty tender and the thought of the runs isn\u2019t pleasant to consider. Hope you find the balance. I will check out the more oophs questions thread\u2026thanks for keeping an eye on that and giving me the heads up. OMG, how exciting is that? Your step-daughter\u2019s boyfriend spruced up grandma\u2019s ring to propose on Valentines Day. And how wonderful is your dh to offer that ring to his future son in law knowing it would mean so much to his daughter? Congrats!!!!! I will have to go out and see if I can\u2019t find a bottle of Marietta\u2026thanks for the tip. That\u2019s some commute, but I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s in great shape. A new car eh? Nice...I don\u2019t blame you for being picky about how the bike wrack is mounted\u2026it\u2019s a new car. Great idea to print out the pics from our thread\u2026 Julie- Loved the pics and the doctor story. I plan to wear my shirt to my Tx3 next week along with my boobies hat and cape. Hope this one will be kinder to you. Fingers and toes are crossed for you. Paula- LOL on your dh\u2019s never done it with a bald lady comment. Sounds like the cold is getting better\u2026you didn\u2019t mention coughing all night. CarolC- Oh honey\u2026I am so sorry about your neuropathy issues. I\u2019m glad you still have a sense of humor, though. I can totally picture you with the wig askew toddling on your tip toes in socks\u2026good thing your coworkers and boss understand it\u2019s chemo se\u2019s and not you hitting the bottle. Glad your new meds kicked in and hope it takes care of it so there\u2019s no discomfort. Judy- Aren\u2019t our hairstylists awesome? My gal didn\u2019t charge me either, nor did my wig gal. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing well\u2026onward and upward. Hope everyone from yesterday's chemotini party is doing well, and go kick cancer booty today Vettegal, Peg1212 and JKiss75, PALady, RN2Teach (Paula) and Deb102307 . SIS Kimberly",

The rock in the gut has already started, but the preventatives are helping with the other areas of digestive distress. I also started my period today\u2026oh joy. Have been getting some stuff done around the house knowing that I won\u2019t be getting much done over the next few days, and finally have a moment to sit and type before heading out for my Neulasta shot and a coffee date (I\u2019ll be doing decaf\u2026since I will only be able to taste coffee another day, I\u2019m taking advantage). D1 and Kris- Loved the photos. Because the chemo lounge was so crowded yesty (stealing that from dear Carol), we couldn\u2019t get pics as my sis was the photographer. Next time\u2026 D1- That is too funny about tucking your hair behind your ears before q-tipping. It\u2019s like having an amputation and having those phantom pains and believing the amputated part is still there. It was making a hair appt. for March that did it\u2026you\u2019re already visualizing all that beautiful hair returning better than it was before. Glad you\u2019re having a good day\u2026and that you are pacing yourself. Dana-Sorry you had issues getting the IV started,but glad you just let the experience just unfold and go with the flow. I know you won\u2019t get results right away, but I\u2019ve got all my positive vibes headed your way. Kalen- Thanks for the good wishes. And\u2026what a great tip on Nordies sewing pockets into bras you already have and love. We\u2019ve got other gals with Boob in a Box who may not have known that. Kathy- Man\u2026Carol\u2019s grannies bed is going to get crowded with all of us sharing it with her. Hope the registration day went well, but more importantly that you and your dd had a fabulous bonding day. Kids remember those days fondly. Wendy- Glad all is well with you and that your daughter\u2019s best friend\u2019s biopsy was benign. The good news\u2026now that she\u2019s had a biopsy at 19, the docs are going to watch her very closely, so if anything ever does turn up, it will be caught early. If it makes you feel better, we\u2019re raining here in CA where I live. Will have rain all week. Carol- Shoot\u2026I totally read your last post wrong\u2026I read it as yeah\u2026two down of 4. Oh well, you\u2019re a 1/3 of the way done!!!! Can\u2019t wait to hear about the new hoot. To tie into your previous hilarious hot tub story, I read a story about a gal in a hot tub and she didn\u2019t even notice her hoot floated right out of her suit\u2026that would be an ice breaker for sure. LOL SheShe- I\u2019m glad my advice was useful to you, and know that your new Cancer Center is going to be a much better fit for you. You\u2019re sounding good, though. Good luck with the wig thing\u2026yeah, it\u2019s not easy getting the exact right fit. LJ13- You must be feeling much better. Good to hear you posting such great info for Kalen and Mother2Daughters. How are you doing Vettegal,CJH, and Paula? wvgirl- I so sorry that DH couldn\u2019t keep himself together for more than a day or two, and that you\u2019re having aches that are keeping you down. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re better today since you\u2019re at work. Keep your chin up\u2026you\u2019ve got your awesome brother, us, and your new support group to help your through this. Well, I\u2019ll check in later. Have a great afternoon ladies. SIS Kimberly PS- We have a few gals on our list that I haven't heard from in a very long time. Shall we PM those gals to see if they still want to be considered January Jewels? And, I still have a Large FUBC t-shirt available...it was tried on, washed to see if it would shrink, then tried on again. A bit too big for me, so I ordered a medium-hopefully in my mailbox today. If anyone needs one and didn't get one, let me know, I'd be happy to send it along as my gift to you.",

      "Content": "Feb 26, 2008 09:41AM - edited Feb 27, 2008 07:28AM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels- Today, a little better than yesty. Still low energy, but not so \u2018blah'. I have to rest up for the Billy Joel concert tonight...a Christmas gift prior to knowing chemo dates. Kathy- I agree that unless you've been here, you can't truly understand. My friends and family say that my writing has given them just a glimpse of what it is we go through, and that they had no idea...all they know is you lose your hair, and you may be nauseous and vomiting. No wonder CathyCa's boss,it is CathyCa's boss right?, sounds so cavalier...her \u2018friends' that went through chemo no problem didn't get into the nitty gritty with her...they put on their game faces. I'm so glad to have found all of you...and so are my friends and family. They often tell me how wonderful it is to have a group like ours. I was so pleased to hear your dad is doing so well. He's already got travel plans...that's so great!!!! Vettegal- Glad to hear you are feeling up to working, but with that kind of \u2018supportive' boss, geeze!!!! Does he not understand you would have rather been at work feeling good than taking time off without pay and feel the way you did? Maybe he needs a little dose of chemotherapy to give him a little empathy. Diana- I am so happy for you that infusion #4 was so easy on you. Let's hope that the se's don't kick in at all!!!! Dana- I'm glad that you got that biopsy done this morning. The faster you get those results, the sooner your treatment can begin. Fingers and toes are crossed, positive vibes sent out to the universe, and I've even done the Hokey-Pokey for good measure. Kris- I'll join you in that FUBC...and I assume that means you're having a moment or joining in the moment of others...either way...it's a great way to just let off some steam!!!! Joan- Welcome back out of the fog. Only four more days until March...and then spring is right around the corner. Glad you had a chance to visit your mom. Is she doing OK in her new environment? I know she was in a temporary place until the family could find something closer...did I miss that move? Kalen- Oh sweetie, it is so totally normal to be excited to finally get on board the treatment train, but also anxiety-ridden about the unknowns...just go with your feelings, girl...let it out and talk about it. You are as \u2018normal' as any one of us...and I'm sure we'd all agree there is nothing \u2018normal' about us...we're special. We're slightly abnormal in fact because unlike too many in our world, we actually have connected with one another...no judgments, no strings, just come as you are...how rare is that? You're going to be fine...we're here for you. Judy- I'm so glad my words were comforting to you. I didn't realize you were dealing with mets...or maybe you did say so in an earlier post and my chemo-brain just doesn't recall. I certainly understand the concern it must cause you. The good news is what you're doing now with the chemo, and what ever else you and your oncologist will do afterwards,is killing breast cancer cells...even those that have taken up residence in places other than your breasts/or where they were. Tomorrow will be here before we know it...and we all will have made it through treatment. The journal is a great idea. It reminds you that it is only 8 days of feeling crappy before the fog lifts. Seems we have the same crappy weekends...next time, lets share a blankie and hibernate together! About the hair. I understand wanting to hang onto any semblance of normal, and you've just finished tx #2. That's when I shaved even the buzz stubble...it literally started to hurt. Your hair isn't going to all fall out at the same time, which is why I believe most of us just shave it off...took control of when we would be totally bald. Your painful/itchy scalp is from chemo...think of your follicles as dancing as fast as they can trying to avoid the \u2018hot coals' that burn their feet if they stay in once place. Some are just dancing faster than others, but eventually they'll succumb. I use Elta lotion...made for diabetic skin found in the pharmacy section of your grocery store or at a pharmacy. Very soothing and doesn't clog pours. Personally, I think you'll feel a lot better if your whole head looks the same instead of patchy...and your dh will feel like he's helping you out if you let him shave it all off. Besides, with the hats, scarves, and wigs out there...you can try the hair styles and colors you've always wanted to try.  Hang in there sweetie...((((HUGS)))) Paula- I am so glad my post inspired you to think about printing it. I did actually take that post and use it's content to write a poem yesterday. So...still coughing and/or not sleeping? Man, that cold is just hanging on...or is it a strain of the flu that the flu shot didn't cover? Personally, I don't do flu shots and haven't been sick with a cold or flu in years. Even now, I am so knocking on wood right now, I have not been sick with anything more than chemo se's. Carol- Maybe that's the problem...I took off the cape after flying home from the chemotini lounge...can't drink and drive you know. You \u2018sound' beat...an up early long weekend at the rink and then up for work at 5am. No wonder you're worn out. Hope you got a good night's sleep. I'm so glad you're close enough to Kalen to just call and hang out. Wendy- LOL about sharing the meds with the dh. He's going to have one heck of a weekend caring for all three of his girls. I could loan him my SuperGirl cape. Therese- Well said!!!! Did I know you were a nurse? ICU...wow! The Jewels certainly do have its fair share of teachers and nurses don't we? I told you I'd keep up now that I'm out of the fog. Have a great day ladies. SIS Kimberly",

The important thing is you checked in with us all and let us know you're doing well. Sista- Kick you out? For having chemo-brain? We'd all be kicked out if that was the criteria. No one expects you to shout out daily, especially when you're in the fog or just feeling tired from your day, sweetie. No expectations, here. Glad you were up to catching up with the posts and shouting out now. Me too on finding things to keep me hydrated. Water starts to get yucky,so I dilute it with a little juice, which changes the flavor up. Tea isn't always tolerable even though I know it's good for me. I don't like sweet drinks, so most sport drinks are out for me. Hope you find something that works. Oh, here's a thought, a nurse told me about Resurgex, which has protein in it, and you add it to water. It's got whey, so I can't have it as I'm allergic to anything to do with cow's milk. No, you definitely aren't alone in feeling your doubts and feeling down. I'm glad the Jewels were able to show you that there is nothing wrong with being a sapphire. SheShe- Well, we must have both been bit by the housecleaning bug yesterday. A neighbor said, \" Man, you must be sicker that you think to be so excited about cleaning house.\" Of course, I knew she was trying to be funny, and I laughed with her saying, \" You got that right...who would have thought that having cancer would make me glad to do housework, but then the alternative isn't all that enticing.\" Glad you're feeling good, and you are so welcome for the t-shirt. I wouldn't worry about your new oncologist's way of doing chemo...every center has their protocol, and I would imagine you'll get the Aloxi in your drip as before and possibly other anti-nausea meds as well. Your new onc. probably needs to see how you tolerate this, so he knows what you really need as opposed to what you last onc. thinks you need. Deep breath...it is going to be OK. Snowing eh? It's sunny here again, today...and it feels like spring, but heard that March is our rainiest month, so don't think this sun will last...so, I'll just have to go enjoy for both of us. Carol- You crazy golfer lady, you...you crack me up. I hate it when my computer just messes up...of course, that usually happens at school...where I have a PC...my Mac doesn't do that...if anything happens with the Mac, it's usually the internet connection that kicks me out for some odd reason, but oh I've been there when I've lost a good bit of writing...so frustrating. Lost part of my Master's thesis and thought I would just have to tell my advisor that I wasn't able to deal with the stress and give up...funny thing was that my thesis was about the importance of stress education and reduction techniques being taught in schools. Thankfully, I managed to finish it, although looking at it now makes me cringe...my advisors certainly didn't do a good job at editing for me and giving me advice on where I needed to expand my ideas. Gotta wonder about why we all jump through these hoops...certainly not to learn content area stuff as much as to prove we have the stamina to go through it all. (OK, off my soap box). And yeah, my lows are low and my highs are high...is Manic-Depression, aka Bipolar Disorder an se? LOL Dana- Wow, what a turn around...your ex is taking you to your first chemo. Maybe now that you two are roommates, he can be your friend more easily. I agree with SheShe about the Biotene to help prevent or minimize potential mouth sores and food that will be easy on the tummy. As far as how long it will knock you over, I do Tuesdays, and the Decadron I take the day before, day of, and the day after keeps me buzzing pretty good. Wednesday, I can start to feel the rock in my gut, Thursday, I'm just feeling really weak and blah with a rock in my gut, and Friday, I'm worse. Sat. and Sun. are about the same as Friday, and by Monday, I'm starting to slowly perk up. I'd say 5 days of feeling unable to do life like you need to do it...school and work. Of course, everyone handles chemo differently, so it may be less time down for you. I'm going to call you Little Warrior if you don't mind...cause that is what you are...and you will be victorious, no doubt about it. Kathy- Bravo!!!! Loved the realization, the resolve, and the quotes. There is only now, the present moment ,for the past is gone and the future in unknown, so why spend our energies in either place? Our energies need to be in the present moment to fully live and be free of fear. Can't be afraid of this moment cause you're already in it, and it is hasn't done a darn thing to harm you. (Please know I'm speaking of the collective \u2018you' here). You're sounding pretty chipper this morning. Hopefully the fog won't be too thick. And great advice for sheshe!!!! Have a wonderful day Jewels...I think I'm going to take my son to lunch. That whole teenage time of life...not wanting to be with the parents so much...gets better in their twenties. It is like a light bulb goes on, and we aren't so much mother and son, but two adults. Oh, that doesn't mean I don't still get on him about keeping up with his grades considering that's his job in our book...more like pep talks because he feels stupid and ill-equipped in classes that require rote memory (terms and definitions) and lots of reading (Learning Disabilities). He's got an IEP, but having more time to take a test that still asks him to deal with rote memory doesn't help him much. I'll be encouraging him to understand that the way he prepares has to be different than the way Kayla prepares (she's getting A's and B's on her exams). He cannot study the day or so before and think he's going to retain the information. He has to find time to review his flashcards each day, several times a day if he's going to build long term memory. Short-term memory doesn't work for him. I'll have to use a gaming analogy as he's really a whiz at computer stuff...and math comes fairly easily to him as well. He's also awesome at the hands-on things like labs. Then, maybe a little shopping. Life is good!!!!! Catch you all later this evening.  SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Mar 2, 2008 01:09PM - edited Mar 2, 2008 01:10PM by SISKimberly Good Morning Jewels, Another beautiful day in Lincoln, CA. Spent yesterday helping the ds at the new house. Tired when I got home. Today, the dh will finish the grouting of the tile...did the sealing yesterday along with changing out a light switch and helping the ds with the internet wiring. I may go over later to see what I can do to help...or not. Paula- WhooHoo on being done with AC, so T is next...half way there, girlfriend!!!!! Shopping and whooping it up, eh? Good for you. Hope the se's this last AC round are easy on you. I can't even imagine living a state away from my sis. It's hard enough living in different parts of our area (only 45 minutes apart). D1- Oh, I know that fog induced numbness/dumbness well. I'm glad you were able to reach out of its hold for a glimpse...You did pretty well considering. See you on the other side OLE. Hang in there. Carol- I love that attitude...I should, but it will be there tomorrow. YES!!!! Shoulds are just darn boring, aren't they? I'm all about what I want to do these days. Of course, the yard might be a jungle waiting to swallow the house and need to be tamed, but at that point...I call the professionals. I know some people enjoy getting out and doing yard work, and bless their hearts and gardening gloves, but I'm not much of a yard work gal. After scraping smushed up plums off the sidewalk as a kid and raking leaves that just kept dropping, then shoveling more snow than I ever wanted to as a preteen and teen, I was ruined on the whole idea of yard work. OK, I did help the dh put in our landscaping in our first home, but that cured me as well from even attempting to help in our Lincoln home. I'll do the housework, no problem!!!! OMG the Half Racks...what a great name. I too thought about the 3 Day event in San Francisco, but won't be ready this year...maybe in '09. You so deserved to kick back yesterday and do nothing after last weekend. So, today, if you want to, do the yard work, or not. I like your golf scenario much better. Loved the pic, and the fact your dh is taking such good care of you!!!!  Sista- My oncology office wanted me to do my labs there (I'd have to pay a co-pay I'm thinking if I did that), but I chose to do them at the lab closer to home. No co-pay for them at the lab. My chemo and injection the next day, both a co-pay. My visit before chemo, a co-pay. It certainly does add up. The FSA was a good idea...and that Visa card sounds like a great idea as well. I'm sorry you hate your job. That's got to be a bummer going through this and then going to a job you hate. Any chance of finding something you'd like once this whole ordeal is over? Like Paula, I enjoy my job and my coworkers and kids...not that there aren't frustrations being a teacher, but overall it's great. CathyCa- That is so great that your son is getting a degree in Horticulture...my hubby has a degree in Horticulture and loves designing our yard and pruning and all that stuff. Not many kids are going into that field, which is sad because we need them...good for his job prospects though. And how great that granddad and grandson have such a bond with golf.  I so want to golf again. I was just starting out last summer and feel I'll be starting all over again once able. Teresa- Welcome to the Jewels. We are a great group. 12 weekly Taxols? Wow, let us know how that goes...no time to recoup. Avistan...another Jewel is doing that I think...can't remember who at the moment. About the trouble breathing, do you mean during the infusion itself? We've had at least 4 here you had issues with the T portion of their treatment, but the nurses are right on top of them. Ask them to drip it real slowly. Wvgirl- You sound so great, so up!!!! I'm so glad you had a good time at the dinner, and what a compliment for someone to think your new wig was your real hair!!!! Looking forward to the pics. Kathy-Hey, you're outta the fog earlier than expected...that's great!!!! I know, still disoriented, but making your way back to us...enough to post our list, you SHERO you!!!! LJ13, glad your Taxol is treating you better than the AC. Hope it continues that way. CHJ- WhooHoo on the sunshine. That just makes all the difference sometimes...that sunny day. Glad you've been feeling so good. Enjoy it while it lasts...and I hear you on the eating thing. What's with that? Well enjoy your Sunday ladies. Go kick some cancer booty tomorrow, Sheshe.

Two in the breast and one in the axillary node. I hope all goes well for you on the 27th. Keep us posted. My chemotini doesn't occur until after the first of the year. I should know the for sure date by next week. Kathy-I don't know if JJ means just joking...maybe D1 will let me know when she returns from NYC... Hope you're having a great time D1...I love NY.

I don't know Hoda Kotbe...who is she? vittegirl-I get it on the drain thing...it won't be too long, and they'll be gone. I'm numb, too where the nodes were removed. I hear that feeling comes back in its own time, if it does at all. I've got better beeling from elbow up to my underarm. Underarm still really numb and the skin on the side of my left breast is numb. Carol and I had our tubes out practically at the same time, and we're doing great-mine were in for 16 days. Good luck to those of you getting ports, biopsies, and starting chemo Dec 27th and into 2/2/08. I won't know until this week sometime when my chemo will begin...I'm thinking it will start next week. Hope your Christmas festivities were enjoyable-Carol, you'll look back on the brother in law slicing his hand thing and laugh with your family at future gatherings-boy, what people will do to get attention HaHaHa.

Carol, I'd get that second opinion, too. It can't hurt. I got so lucky!!!!

Kathy, I just got my first chemotini date...finally...1/8/08, TAC 6 rounds 1 every three weeks...then I'll start radiation...not sure when yet...daily for 4-6 weeks. I also get the Decadron for three days during each cycle and a Neulestra shot the day after each cycle. Thanks for doing this list. AZDonna, getting through that first chemo must be a relief. Take it easy and know we are here for you. Julie...how did it go today? LJ13-I'm glad to hear you are doing so well...there's hope for those of us who haven't had the dreaded N-shot... and dear D1 OLE- Whine, bitch, scream, and swear all you want. I cannot believe what you've been through in the last few days...OMG...I'd be dropping swear words myself. Do you think the N-shot caused the spasms? I can't believe your oncologist's nurse didn't just go to another oncologist in the office and explain the situation...or call your regular physician for you to get a script... Of course that is easy to say when you don't know all the rules and politics of a situation isn't it? And I made you cry...like you needed that...GEEZ. I hope you get relief sooner rather than later.

I've read all the posts from my last one and man are we a talkative bunch. D1/LJ13/MAZ- I'm 100% with you about all of us having moments of sheer panic and fear, but that our only real choice is to put one foot in front of the other and remember \"this too shall pass\". We will all be better, faster, stronger than before...oh, wait that's the Bionic Woman...well, we certainly will be stronger for having gone through this experience and richer for having done it together. D1/OLE- I'm so glad you convinced your med team to give you a muscle relaxer...that you got to cuddle up with your afghan in the basement for an hour of Celebrity Apprentice (used to like that show the first two seasons, but can't take looking at the Donald's hair anymore. He can certainly afford to get hair implants-my hubby did and loves his new hair. He had it done in Canada by Dr. Armani...now come on, the Donald certainly could some mileage out of a new hairline by Armani...). Glad you're feeling better and up to attending your highschool age daughter's b-ball game...and the words of your college gal...aren't kids just the greatest when it counts? OK, the girls are 'tight' at the moment. I have two more visits, and think maybe one more might do the trick, but he wants to stretch the skin enough so it will have a 'natural droop' when the exchange occurs. We'll see. I don't know that I want to be a 38 D again. Smaller might not be so bad. What's the deal with the blisters on one leg...you said you have mouth blisters...but leg blisters is a bit strange...let us know when you get that one figured out. And...yeah...what the heck on getting your period Miss Menopause? Those blood tests obviously have a wide range of normal because that doesn't make sense. At any rate, I heard chemo should put you into chemopause and that it may or may not be permanent. You've had only one chemo round correct? Maybe after the next one you won't have to worry about getting your period. AZ Donna and SheShe-Sorry to hear you are both whooped...but hang in there...one down... Carol- I can understand you feeling 'left out' with such a different regiment than the rest of us... the not knowing so sucks...but we'll all be here for you when you start having whatever se's you have...and certainly someone else will have the same cocktail as you...I thought someone else had a similar thing...can't recall (prechemo brain). No problem bugging me when we start RADs down the line...glad to know we will be doing it together. Yes, I do have sensitivity to clothing under my arms...and sleeping in my birthday suit is such a relief not having cloth rubbing up against me. Even my flannels after a while start rubbing. Dana, how did your appt. go today? WVgirl-glad to hear from you. How did things go today? I don't get why you and others have AC first and then do T after AC is done. I have all three at the same time once every three weeks for 6 weeks. Interesting. Great news on the BRCA test. My dad and twin just had theirs done. My insurance won't cover mine because I didn't have enough cancer in my family line-oh please. Dad got his covered because he's had breast cancer and my twin got hers covered because Dad had cancer and I have cancer. Between both of them, I won't need to do it. If Dad is positive, Kathleen will be as well, and that means I certainly will. Kathy-Working on your feet all day is exhausting then add kids and parents and paperwork and doctors...no wonder you're about to fall over, not to mention the stress of having bc, work not being kind about your leave, and your dad having a heart attack and now surgery on the 9th...Yeah...there's been a little stress in your world, girl. Hope you got a good nights sleep...only a few more days and you can slow down and take a chemotini break...isn't that awful that you have to have chemo to slow down? I'm exhausted just thinking of what you're dealing with. Carol C- Welcome to the JJ's. You've found a wonderful group of women who will give you support, guidance, validation, a pep talk, and whatever else you need. Hey Diana63, welcome to you too. See above. I recognize you from other threads. First chemo's down...glad all has gone well so far. Great Dragon and Knight poem by the way. It does fit this battle that we're waging...lift your swords girls, we're off to slay the dragon!!!! Oh Dana, I hope your oncologist answered all of your questions and that other gals already responding to your post have been of assistance. One thing we know for sure...no one knows how you'll react to your chemo. You may very well be able to continue to work and go to school-wonderful choice of profession...what a wonderful perspective you will bring to your patients- without any trouble. Just get plenty of rest and eat well to keep up your strength- working and going to school is exhausting enough without bc treatments on top of it all. Your last paragraph was right on!!!! Bravo! Vettegal- look at you all red hot! Negative Nodes has turned you into a red siren eh? Watch out dh! I haven't even looked at wigs yet. Don't think I will until I start losing my hair. I plan to just shave my head and go all natural, but trying on wigs just for fun might be a kick...and who knows...maybe I'll like the drama of being able to be any color/style I want. OK, I think I'm caught up. Sleep well for those heading into evening, have an energy filled day for those of you waking. Your SIS (Sister In Survival) Kimberly",

Ahhh well, maybe it is just a reminder to us all to just go with the flow eh? So, I\u2019ve had this chubby little Robin Red Breast flapping against the dining room window for two day now trying to get at something that\u2019s caught its eye. I have a clear vase of silk sunflowers on the table, and the vase is filled with glass marbles. Thought maybe he was drawn to the color or the shine, so I took it off the table. Low and behold, he gave up. I\u2019m thinking of buying him a sunflower at the store and seeing what he does with it. Tina- WhooHoo on getting out of the freezing zone. Here\u2019s to a steady climb in temperature from here on out. Congratulations on your ds\u2019s early conclusion of his Senior year. My son did an early graduation, too. Will he walk with his class in June? Does he have plans for college, community college or otherwise? It took my son several years to finally decide college was the right thing to do if he wanted to live on more than minimum wage. He started and stopped community college a few times and worked, went to the Navy, but was discharged on a medical, then worked full time, and finally two years ago decided to go to college full-time. He\u2019ll be 25 in August and won\u2019t finish his degree for another year or so, but at least he\u2019s on the right track. Each in their own time. Speaking of D1\u2019s recipe, my twin sis called me last night to tell me that one of her colleagues at work who reminds her of our mom wants to make my dh and I dinner for Thursday night. She\u2019s making us lasagne and salad for my twin to deliver to us. Isn\u2019t that so sweet? I\u2019ve only met this gal one time, but Kath shares all of my updates with her coworkers, so they all feel like they know me she says. Paula- Wow, $30,000 is a lot to have to raise. I hope your school board recognizes your efforts, having already raised $20,000, and kicks in a good portion of what you need. Have you applied to your local Target for funding? Target give 5% back to the community, so that might be a source of money, and good PR for Target. Carol- Sorry to hear your tummy is funky, and you\u2019re right about Sprite not having any legs or bouquet. FUSE!!!! So, was it a Cream of Wheat night? Good for you getting a second opinion on the ooph/hormone thing. I\u2019m all for having all the information you can get in order to make the best choice for yourself. Oh, when the boy finds that first girlfriend, it is so hard on us Mom\u2019s. You want to let them grow up, but to see them holding hands and hugging and kissing on a girl is just so\u2026grown up-like. It just hits you like a ton of bricks\u2026things are never going to be the same. I\u2019ll tell you though, since my son has gotten to be older\u2026in his 20\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s like my equal instead of my son if that makes sense. It\u2019s kind of cool. Yep, I\u2019ve been saving the pages. No worries. Is your tool bar missing? The one that lets you do smiley faces and such? Mine is gone. Like Carol said, to all of you who haven\u2019t posted for whatever reason, we are all thinking of you and hoping you\u2019ll check in just to let us know you\u2019re OK. Don\u2019t feel you have to shout out to everyone while trying to catch up\u2026it\u2019s too overwhelming. We just want to know how you\u2019re doing. To those suffering se\u2019s due to infusions, rest easy knowing we\u2019re here for you at the edge of the fog waiting with hot chocolate and warm blankets to wrap around you. We\u2019ll sit with you around the fire and wait with you until you\u2019re energy returns. This is my philosophy of life. It\u2019s been working itself out right on this site, and has decided now is the time to emerge and be known. \u201cRight now, at this moment, is all that is known. The past has offered me lessons to learn, and if I didn\u2019t learn them, I know I will be presented with them again, so there is no need to constantly look back to review what was. Looking back only manages to keep me stuck. The future, although alluring, wants to pull me into a void of unknown. Living there will only keep me entangled in the \u2018what if\u2019s\u2019 and that is a waste of my precious life energy. There is only the now, where everything is as it should be. \u201cNow\u201d resides within \u201cknown\u201d, so right now, in this present moment, is where I choose to reside.\u201d SIS Kimberly",

You'll have this pal until August, then a new one will arrive in Sept.  I don't think there is any hard and fast rules about money spent. If once a week works, great. If twice a month works. OK. If once a month works. That's OK, too.   The goal is to get in touch with your secret pal as often as you want to and let them know you're thinking of them.  No pressure.  I'm not sure how secret it will be since we know the part of the country we are all from and whatever is sent will be postmarked, but that first contact will be exciting to see who it is, and then something to look forward to in the future.   Wow, your boosters sound complicated, but glad they're fairly quick.  Only 4 more to go!!!! We'll be leaving the 24th of May and coming home June 1st.  I'll have to make sure I check our hotels for computer access.  That's a long time to be without contact with the Jewels. SIS Kimberly ",

It\u2019s going to be a hot summer, I think. I hope everyone else is experiencing beautiful weather. I know that parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Tennessee have been suffering from tornados and bad weather in previous days. I hope all our Jewels in those areas are well. Tina- I\u2019m so glad you had a wonderful b-day and Mom\u2019s Day. For the Jewels, the Open sign is always up. Oh, I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t know who your SP is yet. That makes it more fun. MMM, the name of that chicken recipe sounds great. Let us know how it turns out. Some of us will have it easier than others figuring out their SPs, I think, due to post marks.  Carol and I (I\u2019m speaking for you, Carol. Hope that\u2019s OK) are both very happy to have gotten this going knowing how much having something to look forward to and to help us keep more in touch would be beneficial as people some finished treatments and others continued. Carol- Hey, I would so love to hang the sign and have some Jewels show up. Ouch on the crunch of the head and neck for your ds\u2019s partner. Glad he\u2019s OK. I DVR\u2019d DWTS, so I have to watch that some time today. True about not messing up the hair with the \u2018vertible\u2019, but have to remember to put sunscreen on the melon. Paula- OK, apparently I misunderstood something you wrote and led Carol down the wrong path.   I thought you were done, but when you told Maz you were two weeks out from you last tx, I read it as two more weeks until your last tx for some reason. Of course, now that I read it again, of course you meant two weeks from the last tx. Geez, and I\u2019m the Language Arts teacher. You suppose chemo has damaged my brain cells? I love cats, too. I\u2019ve had cats all of my adult life, but my dh is allergic, so when the last of my three kitties left the building, I\u2019ve been without a furry companion. How appropriate to be writing right after Paula\u2019s discussion of kitties being people, too, CHJ.  You know that once you are a Jewel, you are always a Jewel. I\u2019m glad you feel a connection here and that you found a thread that is more \u2018your speed\u2019. We are a chatty bunch, aren\u2019t we? And feeling like you were being left behind is totally understandable. The good news is that we are all in different stages of tx and able to be there for those who will come behind us, so know you\u2019re always welcome here to get rads info and support. Both D1 and Peg are done. WhooHoo on being done as of May 7th. Yeah, expect it to take at least as long as you were in treatment to recover. Be patient with yourself. Wow, you do have a lot going on. Congrats on your house being sold!!!!  The universe is wise. That buyer didn\u2019t come out of nowhere, he/she came because it was the right time. It will be wonderful to have a new place to start a new the new chapter in your life. Make sure to update me on your new address. Just PM me, OK? Well, what to do today?  I love having so much time to just do what I want to do. Check back later. SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Jun 13, 2008 01:11PM - edited Nov 9, 2013 01:16PM by Moderators Good Morning Gals, Thankfully the biter didn\u2019t bring his friends in for a feast last night, but the rash from the Tagederm has arrived. I have a nice square patch of red rash on either side of my body where the tubes once resided. Ahh well, it isn\u2019t like I\u2019ll be struttin\u2019 around in a bikini or anything for awhile. The good news\u2026there won\u2019t be any further need of any kind of adhesive upon my body\u2026other than a port flushing Bandaid, which stays on for such a short length of time\u2026like 20 minutes tops before I yank it off. I see the breast surgeon on July 1st , so I\u2019ll be asking her when that port can come out. Oh, and may I say my shower this morning was fabulous. Sleeping on my side last wasn\u2019t happening though as I have internal stitches under each breast due to the lift that felt like they were pulling when I tried. Those may need a little more time to heal before I attempt that full on sleeping on the side thing. I can do a partial thing though, and that is at least something better than on the back all night. Jenn- I am so sorry about the situation your bff finds herself in today. I can\u2019t even imagine how devastating that must be to have your son lying in a drug induced coma and not knowing if he\u2019ll live of his own accord, if he\u2019ll live, but with brain damage, or if you will have to make that choice no parent wants to make for their child. It just makes no sense when our kids make choices like this. I will be sending out positive energy to your bff, to her friends and family, and to her son in hopes that it helps provide the strength needed to get through whatever is meant to be at this moment and every moment of this chapter. Jenn, estrogen is made in fat cells, but it\u2019s not the same type of estrogen that is made in the ovaries. Check out womenshealthnetwork.com to read more about the three different types estrogens. I\u2019m going to send you The Schwartzbein Principle. If after reading about the what, how, and why\u2019s of our endocrine system and the effects of one that is out of whack, and find you are interested in what it has to say, get her most recent book, The Program, which will walk you through the 5 Steps. Even though you\u2019ve got some stuff goin\u2019 on, you\u2019re sounding really strong, girl!!!! I\u2019m topless all the time, too. Haven\u2019t worn my wig more than a handful of times, and certainly not at all after my last tini. Cooking? Bravo!!!! What did ya end up making? Hunker down for that impending weather. D1- What a wonderful thing\u2026the family portrait with multi-generations included. I so hope your mom will decide to come along. I\u2019m thinking I will have my toes and nails done next week before I head out to Chicago, and maybe another facial since I\u2019ve got a gift certificate to spend. Ohhh\u2026just took a time out to book that\u202612:30 on the 20th. WhooHoo\u2026I can\u2019t wait! Afterwards, it will be off to Kathleen\u2019s house to stay the night and then up early the next morning to head out for our adventure. LOL on your pup talking trash, even before the diet was imposed, for sportin\u2019 a watermelon shampoo smell. Julie \u2013 Bummer about the pool pump acting up. Hope the dh can gt in there and fix it so the pool can be cleaned up and ready for the weekend. Isn\u2019t school out for you? Are you just tying up lose ends so you\u2019re ready for the fall? Last filler up today. My expanders were 600cc volume, and I had 100cc\u2019s when I first left the hospital. I did the full 600 in order to get a good enough skin stretch, and the ps wanted to overfill so I\u2019d have plenty of skin to eventually obtain a naturally breast crease, but after 600, I was soooo done. My implants were filled to 520 on the right and 540 on the left in order to be even. I\u2019m very happy with the new foobies even though they haven\u2019t \u2018fluffed\u2019 out yet as Therese would say. I wonder how she\u2019s doing, anyway. Carol- Speaking of Hot Flashes\u2026loved the card I got in the mail yesty. Thank you so much\u2026cracked me up!!!! I am soooo happy for Steph!!!!! Just look at what Jewel power can do!!! \u2026and you were off last night to get ya some more power, eh? Interested to hear what you learned. A sleep over. How fun. Have a fabulous Sat. with your gf and Ginny. Sounds like a fabulous way to spend the day. See ya on line, Sunday. Kathy \u2013 LOL on the weed whacker comment!!!! Have a great weekend. I too will be gone tonight through Sat, so won\u2019t be checking in until Sunday, either. Paula \u2013 Glad to hear from you. Guess the tests went well since Ed started with the clinical trial. I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019ll be able to take your trip to Dallas next week ,but totally understand the \u2018down time\u2019 you\u2019re talking about\u2026just doing nothing you have to do like work or whatever. We\u2019ll have to coordinate with Carol. She wants to come out earlier than Kent, so maybe she can fly into Sacramento, and I can pick her up, and we can head down to Palo Alto. When Kent flies into Sac, he can rent a car, and she and I can meet up with him\u2026or something like that. How fun to meet you both at the same time!!!!! Take care gals, and have a great weekend. We will be leaving around 3pm to pick up twinsis and her beau before heading out to Murphy\u2019s for the concert. We\u2019ll be staying the night and coming home the back way through the Amador and Fair Play wine country to pick up our Fleur D\u2019Lys shipment. SIS Kimberly Edited by Mods to update link",

I will still do that when I get back, but it will be a three hour trip there and back.  Maybe I\u2019ll put the top down on the convertible and let the breeze blow through my hair \u2026 WHEEEEE!!! Maz- You must have posted when I was posting, I would never have missed responding to your loss of your Dad. I am soooo sorry. Certainly your family can wait until you\u2019re able to attend the burial at sea.   Whew, on the ole ticker being fine though, but two nights in a hospital doesn\u2019t sound like fun at all. I\u2019m with D1 on getting out there and walking to get the blood flowing to help with the blood pressure issue and to relieve the stress your undoubtedly feeling. ((((HUGS)))) Julie \u2013 Well done on the four hour mowing job. Kids and water just go together don\u2019t they? Thank goodness ds was willing to hang out with them and be a great big bro and cousin. D1- Nothing like a girl who knows what she wants. Some guy is really going to appreciate that quality in her some day. WOW!!!! Her AP scores are fabulous. She's got smarts that one! Brag away!!!!! Hey, nice shiny ring and a sweet message from your dh started the anniversary off a day early. Nice! The fact you\u2019ve been working on this for four years means you\u2019re both in it for the long haul. Communication is so hard sometimes since we all have different patterns of communication and don\u2019t often know how to \u2018hear\u2019 other types. Kudos to you both for hanging in and working on things. So, if I may ask, do you know what the dh means when he says just be more communicative? As I said above, what he means and expects may not be what you understand communicative to mean as your communication styles are very different. As an example, I\u2019m a \u2018sayer\u2019 and my dh is a \u2018doer\u2019, so I need to \u2018show\u2019 him more, and he needs to \u2018tell\u2019 me more when it comes to feeling appreciated and loved. Sorry to hear that your hotflash strip tease isn't getting you any action. Would installing a pole in the bedroom help? Glad Kippy is springing back to life. The other pups in the neighborhood may have to wear shades around her new pearly whites, eh? Have a wonderful well deserved anniversary dinner tonight, and I hope the curtains look as good as you imagined them based on your swatch. (Just read that the curtains weren\u2019t exactly what you ordered, but didn\u2019t hear the fabric was the problem, only the style mixups. Tipping an installer? I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. Offer him a glass of ice tea and one of your fabulous brownies maybe?) LOL on the vapors comment regarding LJ13\u2019s hands. I don\u2019t think you want to get the vapors.  The vapors -A name for hypochondriasis, spleen, or depression of spirits. [Thomas1875] Archaic - 1. Exhalations within a bodily organ, especially the stomach, supposed to affect the mental or physical condition. 2. A nervous disorder such as depression or hysteria. [Heritage] Also can be flatulence. Carol \u2013 Looks like you\u2019re able to check in through out the day at work. That\u2019s a nice perk if you have to be at a desk. It was good to talk with you. Bummer that Paula won\u2019t be out here to meet us, but we\u2019ll raise a glass of vino to her and Ed. I\u2019m planning on seeing you sometime between the 14th through however long you guys want. There\u2019s lots we can do until your dh arrives. I don\u2019t know if you want to head down to SF to see your friend with the tongue cancer and stop by Davis on the way back up to see your step daughter before you come here, or reverse that on your way back home and drive up the coast. Whatever works for you. OK, so my PT Babydoc really gave me the once over today. OUCH!!! Then added an exercise to my routine I do there. It involved rolling over a ball and catching myself on the other end. Took some practice before I didn\u2019t look like I was drunk. The massage later in the afternoon was deep and this morning I feel like someone beat me up. Yep, I need to drink lots more water today. I agree with Kathy and D1, you are amazing with your 'just because' gifts, cards, and calls. I love that we all have something to bring to this table. Hi Carla \u2013 Good to hear from you. Glad all is well as far as your surgery.  Getting back to work will be OK if you\u2019re not having to lift stuff or do lots of reaching. The side where nodes were removed will get sore with use and may swell a bit. An 1\u201d a month?  It\u2019s been at least two since I started getting fuzz and I\u2019ve barely got ¼\u201d up top and ¾\u201d on the sides and the back of my head, but it\u2019s laying down nicely so far. LJ13 \u2013 Nice hands!!!!  Your emerald is gorgeous. Kathy \u2013 Sounds like your job is really meeting your expectations. I\u2019m sooo glad. A frozen humidifier?  I guess with the moisture/humidity there houses need those. Man, mold is not good. I hope your dh got it before it caused too much damage. Are humidifiers expensive to replace? LWDana- I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve decided to just let this play out. Again, your testimony will be most likely be used to bolster the case if you don\u2019t get to testify personally, so just remember the goal \u2013 get this guy out of medical practice.  If you choose to do a civil suit, know it won\u2019t be any easier, but if he\u2019s convicted of the criminal case, it will bolster your civil case. You might want to consider a civil suit with the other victims to make the case even stronger.  Of course, once he's convicted, you may want to just let it go and move on with your life. OK, gotta run, or should I say drive. Have a fabulous day all, SIS Kimberly",

I'm sure it will get itself back to normal soon...she says crossing her slightly tingly/numb feeling fingers and toes. The hair on my head is getting dark. My PT staff noted it yesterday. I guess I see myself so often, I hadn't noticed, but they hadn't seen me since last Monday, so I'm thinking I must be getting darker. Hmmm. So, the tooshie is still pretty sore. I have stretched and alternated with ice and heat...and boy do I wish I could say that I was getting busy when this injury happended, but alas I have no clue how this happened. My PT guy and my massage therapist agree that long periods of sitting can infuriate this muscle, but I wonder why it took so long to start hurting after we arrived? We got there on Tuesday and it started Friday evening.  We did stop several times and stretch on the way up and on the way home, so I'm not happy thinking that sitting for more than an hour at a time will cause this to happen again.  I haven't sat for more than an hour without getting up and moving around, so hopefully that will help. Sigh Tomorrow I have PT again...I'm cringing just thinking about him even getting close to my gluteus maximus-and I do say maximus with all the literal meaning I can muster  I'm don't care how much of a babydoc he is...he's not touching my tooshie tomorrow. Afterwards, I will come home to get ready for lunch with some of the teachers from school- retired and continuing, then a group of us will go see Mama Mia.  I'll try to check in after I get home tomorrow from my day.

I got done with PT around 6 or so, came home for 30 minutes, then headed out to my massage. Did a little browsing at Kohls before my 8pm appt.  I didn't get home until after 10pm.  Slept great. Today, the maid comes.  My office is a mess, so I'm just closing that door. I've got stuff on the floor.  We took the desk out, which is sitting in Greg's office...the front room...until we can move it out into the garage. I need to clear a space. My sis is renting a truck in Sept. so it can sit in the garage until then.  I was hoping the new furniture would be hear by now, but it seems it might be next week instead. Sigh.  I've got lunch with a friend, then I'll clear that space in the garage. Tonight is the big HOA meeting. Man, I hope this is the end of it. Carol - WhooHoo...'cation has started!  OK, preparation for 'cation has started...but by this afternoon, you are on the road. Drive safely!!!!  How's the ole hoot doin'? Therese - Hi, how good to hear from you.  Sounds like all is well in your neck of the woods. Lucy - Yeah, Cancer sucks!!!!!!  There is no rhyme nor reason for why or who is the lucky recipient. The good news is that you're not alone in this journey anymore. Glad to hear your treatment is over...except the Tamox.  How's that going as far as side effects?  It's good you're doing an ultrasound to check things out. You so haven't let your girls down. On the contrary, you've shown them how strong and courageous you are in the face of adversity. What a powerful message to send your girls that you can get through anything with the right attitude.  OK all you Secret Pals. This is the last month you'll have your current secret pal. I will be sending out the new names the week of the 25th, so if there's something you've been wanting to send...do it in the next two weeks.  Lucy, and anyother Jewel who wants to join in who wasn't ready when we started, if you want to join in the fun, send me your name, address, birthday, likes and dislikes via a PM. I'll print it off and send it along to another January Jewel.  Have a great day ladies, SIS Kimberly ",

Carol and I are having a great time.  We just got back from Lake Tahoe and are looking forward to a yummy dinner of London Broil- grassfed beef.  Carol arrived yesty around 11 or so in the A.M.  We got some chatting out of the way then went to lunch after driving around town a bit. We ate at a U Food Grill, a place that focuses on organic and heathier choices in food.  After, we did some more tootling around and came home for a bit of a nosh and a glass of wine. My dh arrived home close to 7pm and made a fabulous meal of salmon, shrimp, Quinoa, and a Caprese salad with goat cheese instead of buffalo mozzarella. Man, it was fab! So, tomorrow, Carol's dh arrives, so we'll do stuff in Sacramento and then see what else they'd like to do. Carol's reading a magazine waiting her turn on the 'puter, so I'm off.  Enjoy your weekend gals, SIS Kimberly ",

I got a lot of alone time in my room to do what I needed to do, so I think that always is more relaxing then being around a bunch of people. I've got only a few more files to go through and then some items to run off for kids on Tuesday and the rest of the week (I like to be ahead of the game), Can't do any of that until our Dept. had its meeting (I'm the Dept. Head) and gets a few things done - writing assessment prompts and rubrics for each grade level, dates for testing and scoring, and our department's SMART goal (don't even ask what SMART stands for, I can't remember). It is basically a goal we set that is measurable for the year. So, Kathy, I am so sorry that your 'cation had to end throwing you back into reality. Hope the 9 hour drive is uneventful.   Maybe D1 will take all that energy she has, walk to your place, and get that laundry done for you. LOL D1- I should say you had quite a day!  Talk about an overachiever...I can see where dd#2 gets her drive.  Your weekend sounds like a marathon driving session, but so fun to spend time with the girls. I totally understand starting to mourne early. Retirement is so much for fun than working...I would rethink that. You couldn't do all that you do in a day if you were working.  I know you really want to get back into something, but maybe take it slow...start part time maybe? Carol - Oh, 'cation is over for you,too. Bummer.  I think that was a good move to get home in time to unwind, get the chores done, and not be faced with all that on Sunday night. Hope the weather is welcoming.  Gotta go, the dh brought home some din-din. SIS ",

      "Content": "Sep 6, 2008 01:53PM - edited Sep 6, 2008 02:00PM by SISKimberly Good Saturday Morning Jewels, 8 days down with the kiddos, 175 more to go. Maybe I should do that in weeks like Paula did, so it sounds better . So, yesterday, we had our Dean and Scheduler coming in to ask for volunteers to shift to one of two new LA classes opening up.  If you recall I stated we were packed to the rafters.  It was so sweet that none of my kids wanted to volunteer even though I told them I wouldn't take it personally if they wanted to move classes.  They had to be bribed with elective options. The bad part is that our two period REACH class for at risk kids was dismantled. Those 14 kids were split in two and will now be part of a regular LA class, which sucks for the teacher as she hasn't taught 7th regular LA since her first year at Buljan, but really if we all have to use differentiated instruction (ways to make sure all levels learn) to reach all of our kids anyway, why give 14 kids two blocks of time when the other LA classes have 34?  So, we'll see how my roll sheets change. My elective will pick up some kids from her class 2nd period and my LA classes should shrink a bit. WhooHoo. Wendy - Hey!!!! It is soo good to hear from you.  You're welcome for checking in to see how things were going. Glad to hear you're coming up for air after a lengthy visit from the parents. As much as we love our family, there is a sense of AHHHH, when longs visits come to an end. WhooHoo for another gal going topless in the USofA. Isn't it great?  I get my port out over the Thanksgiving break. Carol, the surgeon who put it in is the same one who did my mastectomy. She will take it out. D1- My plan is to get off my butt and exercise on top of my already pretty good eating habits. Next week I plan to use our weight room at school for the cardio- eliptical machines- before heading out to yoga at the District Office at 4:45.  That will be Mondays and Wednesdays. On Tuesday and Thursday, I plan to head to Sierra Gardens Elementary for a 4:45 circuit/core class. 15 pounds is a lot in three months, but it's a goal I'm shooting for that's for sure. Could your dd's other BBall coach right a letter rather than her highschool coach? With her writing score and wanting to get into Journalism or something writing oriented, her score beat the pants of that other girl. Carol - Glad to hear that the baby is doing well as her mom and dad.  That's good news that she'll be back in Redding in a week.   I can't believe that the weekend of your 3 Day event is upon us. It seems like only yesterday that you were just thinking about doing it, then working on your training walks.  Good thing this is a short week for you. Are you taking the following Monday off as well to recoup?  Like D1, I am soooo proud of you.  CathyCa, your walk is in October, right?  Carol should be ready to jump up and down by then and root you on for your turn. How's your coworker doing? I had a brainfart...I know his name starts with an S...(it will come to me later).  Glad to hear your wine is being well cared for. We are having a Pinot tasting at our house this evening. We've got a total of 7 people and some good food that pairs well with Pinot being brought by our guests. Greg is of course making some fabulous contributions - mushroom pate and lamb lollipops (lamb loin on the end of a scewer). We also have some fruit and cheeses that will pair nicely. Should be fun. It's all small plate stuff like Tapas. The ds just called to invite us over for a BBQ tomorrow. He's all excited about his new BBQ. He wanted one for his birthday, so the family gave him Home Depot cards.   His gf asked if I wanted her to volunteer in my classroom on Monday and Wednesday...sa-weet!!!!  I'll run that by the boss and start her ASAP. Paula - Wow, you just don't stop do you?  How exciting for your ds to be choosing colleges and doing his interviews (OK, a bit nerve racking as well, but what great experience to have to market yourself to a college).  I'm with you on D1's Vassar hopeful having the right stuff to get in...hopefully B-Ball will be what takes her over the top.  So, what is your son's career goal? You probably stated that somewhere, but my chemobrain is alive and well, too. I totally have issues pronouncing words sometimes that I never had issues with before, or can't think of the word I need, or say the wrong word all together...like 'dick the stownloaded items', instead of 'stick the downloaded items in your binder after you print them off'.  Oh man, that got a laugh...thankfully it was my elective and a small class with 7/8, and many kids who know me. Geez!!!! My hair isn't cooperating with the gel yet.  Hmmm. I do need to get a little 'trim' along the ears and the back though. I had a student come up and ask if I'd seen Freaky Friday. I told her I loved that movie. She told me I look and sound just like the mom - Jamie Lee Curtis. I told her I would take that as a huge compliment. I hope you get to meet Carla.  I hope she's OK.  Haven't heard much from Dana either or Vettegal lately along with others.  So, Paula, why a Brain MRI?  And a PET scan, too. I don't get any scans, only blood work. I think I will ask for a scan at my 1 year mark.  OK, gotta get moving.  Later all, SIS ",

      "Content": "Sep 20, 2008 11:19AM - edited Sep 20, 2008 11:23AM by SISKimberly Good morning Jewels, Wow, what a week. I've read all the posts, but am on my way to a wedding, so I'll do more formal shouts tomorrow.   Jury duty concluded yesterday afternoon. Yippee!  I was at school the last two nights until 8pm trying to get my sub taken care of, my student teacher organized, etc...I felt like I had two jobs ths week.   D1- First, I'm sending lots of Super Girl energy to your sis.  Tell her that it worked for me, so I'm thinking that lump doesn't stand a chance. OK, the case.  She was guilty on one count, but not the other two.  Involved meth use, driving, and a 12 year old without a seatbelt sitting on the edge of an open jeep.  The law is so darn specific that all elements of a count have to be met to be found guilty, so as the jury formperson, I had to remind the jurors that as much as they may feel she needs to be found guilty of certain things, we had to follow the letter of the law. Besides, the Prosecution didn't prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt, the Deputy didn't do the best job with the paper work/observation sheet, and the experts contradicted eachother, of course.  i was actually pleased, as were the other jurors, to hear from the defense afterwards that she would be sentenced to treatment and not jail. There were lots of factors not presented in court, and we could not consider, that pointed to this person having had ADHD and anxiety disorder undiagnosed as a younger person thus the use of Meth which made her feel normal. She was diagnosed as an adult and prescribed meds, but once on meth it's hard to stop, I hear. She didn't have a lot in her system, but it was still there, so hopefully she'll use this as a chance to kick this and move on with life. We also had a teacher arrested at school for a sex offense this week. We were all in shock. This guy had adopted a foster kid from our school 8 years ago. This kid was troubled. He also helped another kid who ended up moving in at 18 to help with the adopted boy after school. That didn't work out, so the teacher told this kid he had to go.  Both kids are adults now and both have been arrested for sex crimes in the past few years, most recently the former 18 year old.  We think these kids are in cahoots because the teacher told them they couldn't come back due to their poor choices. The teacher had suspected something was up and had already hired an attorney before his arrest, so I've got to believe that the former 18 year old is desperate to pin his behavior on the teacher's influence since he's being tried as an adult.  It just kicked us all in the stomach. I feel so badly for this teacher.  Granted, reaching out to troubled kids is a great thing, but man it is so easy to just to make an allegation because you're pissed off and it's over for that teacher.  Even though he will be proven not guilty, his reputation has been tarnished to the point he'll never get another job teaching.  Sure makes me think twice about being anywhere with a kid without other adults around. It's been a pretty rough week in so many ways.  Thankfully, I had my massage scheduled yesterday at 5:30, but that means I'm going to school on Sunday to get ready for Monday.  Sherry, glad the old gall bladder is no longer an issue.  Rest and take care of yourself. D1 and Paula, have fun meeting up today.  I'm so excited for you both. Big Jewel hugs all around. Carol - Me too...only 9 more years. I hope I can make it that long. After this week, I don't know.  I feel like I've lost a week with my kids, and that I'll have to redo what should have been done anyway...sigh!  So, Kath, how are the new nips? Didn't that happen already? GTG Love ya guys, SIS Kimberly ",

Grading papers, entering grades, doing lesson planning, going to meetings, and walking daily. I'm finally caught up after jury duty, so next week, I can return to yoga after school on Monday and try Cardio Sculpt on Tuesday. I'm hitting some balls on Wednesday, going to the weight room Thursday, and having my weekly massage Friday. Of course, I'll walk everyday during my prep period except Tuesday, which is a planning day with my student teacher. I'm down to 149. My weight last weekend was a flukeas it went up to 151.5 the next day. I've lost six pounds so far, 9 to go. Scary news. My twinsis' breast MRI showed a nodule in the right breast. She has a biopsy on Tuesday. I plan to go with her, so I'll miss 5th and 6th period. I told her that nodule is good, meaning small and most likely encapsulated. It could be a cyst or calcification and not to jump to any conclusions as I'd already taken the cancer bullet for the twins. So, fingers and toes crossed girls. How are you all doing? Norma - Hey, long time no post! Good to hear from you. I'll check out the link to your article when I'm done posting. That's so great that your group's been featured. Glad to be of help with the typing in word tip. D1 - So, Mom needs a new computer after only two years? Seems there should be a warranty for such a short period of time. Your sisters will totally come through for you...more so than DH...for your le care. Yeah, Carol's reminder was much needed. I have to remember that none of this little shit even matters in the long run. If kids don't do their homework, not my problem. If kids do not study for their tests, not my problem. I only have control of what is happening in my classroom...most of the time. HeeHee. Sometimes I wonder if the kids know I'm there with the amount of socializing that goes on compared to getting work done...mostly my last period class. I remember being just like that, but I did always get my work done, however. Dinner out...with no dessert, eh? I'm sorry that things haven't yet moved forward in that area of your life. Must be frustrating to want to live your best life and have your dh still be \u2018stuck' so to speak. I know you've made overtures with no success in the past, and you can proud of yourself for being the grown up and making the first moves. With all of your garments and now the silicone pad under your pit, I imagine \u2018taking it off' in a sultry sexy way isn't in the romantic plans, so advance planning is in order...but, you're a great planner, so I don't anticipate that holding you back at all. Paula - A big WHooHoo!!! on the positive results of all tests for you and the shrinking tumors for Ed. Could the PET scan be showing cells in the aorta and lymph system still recovering from chemotherapy and all? Carol - First of all, thank you so much for the pictures of our Jewels. Awesome!!!! Second, sorry I missed your Cancerversary...congrats on being a whole year out and being in such a great place in your life-unfulfilling job and all. LIFE IS GOOD!!!! I agree that Paula's docs seem to be doing lots of follow-up compared to some of ours. That's great for her peace of mind. I can't decide if I want to do more scans or not at this point. So, my dx date is coming up this Friday. Knowing my sis is doing a biopsy on Tuesday and could have results on Friday is bitter sweet...I so want 10/10 to be remembered for Kathleen having gotten good news (and for our VP having had her baby...she so wants to have her baby next week...poor thing is sooo uncomfortable.) About the job...think of it as what you do to pay the bills, then find something outside of work that is fulfilling. As much as I love teaching, I'm tired. This takes a lot of energy on a daily basis both physically and mentally. I so want to be able to use my counseling degree when the new junior high opens, but who knows when that will be. Yeah our neighborhood is pretty cool. My friend and I who were registering Democrats to vote last Sunday, actually got several republicans switching parties. WhooHoo! (Sorry for the political reference,Jewels, I know that can be a touchy topic for some.) (Ouch...just slapped my own hand. HeeHee) Greg was up to his elbows in wine grapes on Friday. He bought some Alicante Bouche and some Temperanillo. I don't know what to say...he's loving this wine making hobby. We'll have 5 more gallons of wine to rack soon. He got his boss involved as well, so his boss is making some wine, too. How the universe works...you walk with a gal who is walking just because the cause is important, and then her mom is dx. Seems to me she was in the right place to meet you and others in order to find support she didn't even know she needed at the time. CathyCA- Hi, good to hear from you. Thanks for the information about the book. I didn't even know colleges had parent committees. How cool is that? And may I just say, if hot water is the only issue, your ds is in a great place. I'm so glad all is well with him and you. Sherry - My take on things is if it takes that much effort to make it work, it probably isn't worth it. I know you want to work, but maybe this online company isn't the one for you. How are you assured of a pay check after putting in whatever time you put in? Sorry, mama bear is getting protective. Good job of walking two miles a day. That's great! You're welcome for the positive energy sent your way. I'm not actually teaching the class yet, just proposing it. I emailed the gal at Sutter about it and have not heard a word, so maybe this isn't the right time to do this. Like I said, if it is something that doesn't seem to come without a lot of work, it may not be the right time or the right thing at this point. Therese - HI!!!! Wow, what a great couple of events you'll be attending in the next few weeks. Happy early birthday! I am using this month to remind my staff to have their annuals- both men and women. There's a walk this next weekend in town, I just heard about (I've been so sheltered this past few weeks - no news, no radio - not a bad thing), but don't know much else about it. I might check it out. Jules - I love that pic of you and Norma. We sooo have to arrange a get together for when school is out. We get out the 12th of June. I'd be on a plane that afternoon if need be. We need someone who isn't working full time to get this going. All caught up. Again, I hate not being able to check in daily like I used to do, but at least I can do so once a week. Hope all our Jewels are having a great Sunday. Love to all, SIS Kimberly",

      "Content": "Dec 31, 2008 12:10PM - edited Dec 31, 2008 12:34PM by SISKimberly OK, Jewels, no time for major shout outs. Greg and I decided last minute to go to San Francisco for New Years. I have to pack still. He found a great deal at the Hyatt Regency on the Embarcadero near the warf for two nights.  We should have a view of the Bay where fire works will be going off at midnight. Greg called and the gal stated she would make it happen. Tina, it was so good to hear from you what's been happening in your world. Your boys are on their way aren't they? My dad and older sister taught handicapped skiers when we lived in Tahoe. It is a rewarding endeavor.  Hoping the year you have to move will lift the market a bit so your house sells. Carol, Norma, and D1...I usually wait to take the Christmas Decour down until after the New Year, but I've not had a maid before, and it just seemed like the thing to do... start fresh for the New Year so to speak. Tamox se's do not sound fun to me at all. I am so sorry that you guys are dealing with them, and Carol, you with the AI se's.  Do you think they are more tolerable than the Tamox from your experience? Yoga sounds nice. Our District cancelled our Wellness Program claiming it costs them too much, so I guess I'm on my own again.  I'll be hopping on the Eliptical at school Monday and doing three days a week in our weight room. The Wii is fun, but it stops every few minutes to give you a change of exercise, so it's not a fluid routine.  My son got a newer program he's trying out that doesn't stop after each exercise, so I'll wait to hear how he likes it. The games are fun to play, however, so it's still an asset to have IMO. OK, gotta run....  As 2008 fades, exhausted by the challenges of getting a nation to see how far off track it was and to finally remove the blindfold, America blinks and squints painfully as its eyes adjust to the light of reality, and the way has been paved for the Devine 2009.   Bette Midler is going to love her!   You didn\u2019t think I\u2019d send you into the new year without a poem, did you? The Devine 2009   Reminiscent of a 1940\u2019s pin-up, her upswept silky chestnut brown hair, makes her thick-lashed doe eyes stand out against a back drop of pale porcelain skin, lightly rouged cheeks, and a rosy full-lipped mouth. Elegantly dressed in a black satin, figure fitting sleeveless gown trimmed with shimmering gold accents along the bodice and hemline, she descends the twelve-step staircase, as if floating, just as the clock strikes midnight. Everyone looks to her as she gracefully glides to the center of the staircase with a breathtaking smile that assures all who witness her that Devine 2009 will bring with her long awaited change and the beginning of a new era. Her striking features would ordinarily bring whispers accusing her of being all beauty and no brains, but not now, for we are more aware of the importance of looking beyond the media glossed surface of things. Something about her elicits our confidence. Her message is simple for it is borne of universal truth\u2026  \u201cNow is the time to work together for the betterment of all, rather than for the few.  Our planet, our children, and our elderly need us to ensure they will be well cared for and loved now and far into the future. We need to see our community as one global community rather than one nation trying to gain or to regain power. We must become a community of nations, siblings born of the same life energy, doing what\u2019s right for the family, so that all may benefit equally, no one more important than another.\u201d As the clock concludes its inauguration ceremony, Devine 2009 draws nearer to the last step, and as she does, her visage begins to change before our eyes. Her hair now lustrous silver, and her face although still luminous, now shows signs of age. \u201cAh\u201d, she says softly, \u201cIn my youth, your past, my beauty captivated you, but my words fell on deaf ears as you frolicked in your prosperity. A gift wrapped beautifully is more often easily received. I offer my wisdom and a gift, a rare, pivotal-moment opportunity. Do not squander it.\u201d                     Happy New Year                     All my love, Kimberly Hmmm, this is not the format of the poem on the original. It should all be 5 line stanzas, but the site won't let me fix the lines. Poopy!",

What the heck are you doing with your arm to get 'tennis' elbow?  Certainly, not tennis this time of year. LOL Here's a URL for our balcony view on New Years Eve. I don't know how to make it an active link, so copy and paste it into your browser.  The voice at the end is me saying Happy New Year...listen...as I held up the phone for the twinsis to hear all the festivities, then explaining where we were. Off to see a musical review called, \"Forever Plaid\".  I got my seating charts done, all my email from being gone for three days, and all but ten narratives. I'll read those tomorrow, head to school afterwards to make sure I'm ready and to enter their narrative scores, then hit the grocery store on the way home.

Vettegal- Wow, you'll be the first to do the hysterectomy. I go in to talk to my onc. about my discussion with the surgical obgyn on the 28th, so I'll be scheduling mine as well. I'm thinking that I should get this done right after the Jewel Reunion in July. Sorry, I'll be rooting for the Ravens since they are the underdog team...I always root for the underdog. Wear your thermals to work, then when the boss says something about your \u2018attire', explain that you don't have a choice since it's freezing in the warehouse. A space heater under your desk might help. They make some energy efficient ones. I couldn't work productively in a place where I was freezing by toosh off. Therese - How exciting to be doing the 3 Day next year...and I see Cathy and Carol have already given you lots of good info. Appears all is well in your world...so good to see you/all of us moving on...even it isn't moving back to the 'normal' we anticipated.  New is good, Jewels,...challenges force us to grow...'like we haven't been pretty challenged enough.' I can hear you all saying. True, but moving to a new normal is a much more pleasant altermative to what we were doing last year at this time. Paula - Good news all the way around for Ed's potential positive response to this new treatment, and for your test results. NED is GOOD!!!!   I use a Mac and Windows for Mac, but I don't have that issue with messages about fragments...hmmm. Thanks for reminding me to share with D1...I've seen Barry Manilow, Bette Midler, The Eagles, Celine Dion, Josh Grobin, Michael Buble, Elton John, Sheryl Crow, Tina Turner, Dave Mathews, Crosby, Steels, Nash, and Young, Manhattan Transfer (my first concert), Hootie and the Blowfish, Smokey Robinson, Lionel Ritchie, Maroon 5, Carol King, Eric Clapton, Santana, and a few more I can't recall. I love going to concerts, so a show in Vegas would be OK by me. I mailed my New Years letter to Jenn with a personal note asking her how she's doing, but don't think Jackie is on our address list. Kathy - I'm impressed that you were able to do all you did not being able to see very well. It's that mom thing...we can do anything that needs to get done for our families. Is the eye thing a possible se from chemo or Herceptin? Normal? What is that? CathyCA- Isn't our weather just crazy nice for this time of year? Sure could use some rain though, or we are going to be in a world of hurt come summer. On your treadmill in the mornings...good for you!!! I agree we have dates July 12-15, now we need a plan. I think one show might be fun, but lots of time to visit sounds more like what most of us want to do. Hanging out in a nice pool area, walking and talking, ect... I'd prefer a Chinese cooking class to port removal, too. You're right, it really was just part of me, but the whole flushing every 4 to 6 weeks was just another appt., so crossing that off the list was good. Jules - What's up with your school not getting to stay home and your ds getting to stay home? I can't believe the cold, rain, and snow some of you guys are getting. Deep breath where school is concerned. In this tight budget climate administration is probably not making choices about money/sections/staff that will please everyone. Hang in there. Haven't heard from Kris. Hope all is drained, and she's just really busy. Tried the link, but I have to create an account to see anything. Carol - You hit the treadmill, too? Good for you! I've not done anything this week, but one yoga workout. I hate being sick. Oh well, next week, I'm back on the exercise wagon. CHJ - Yeah, who is in charge of the winning slot machines? Sign me up. Tina - OMG on the temp in Minnesota. Dang, girl. Colorado is going to seem down right tropical in comparison. Met with Kath and her new Onc THursday. Love her onc !!!! She was very thorough, drew pictures, hugged, and is adding us to a genetic study. She's doing the oncotype test on Kath's tumor tissue as I pointed out it was strange that my ERPR percentages were so much higher than hers, and the onc said that caught her attention as well. That test will redo the ERPR status and show if Kath needs chemo or not. We all doubt it including the onc, but she wants to be sure. Since both our oncs are in the same office, I said, Dr. Gowda never drew me pictures or hugged me, and the receptionist laughed and said, I'll put a note in your file \"Kim required pictures and hugs\". LOL When I see him on the 28th, I'm going to ask if that notation was made to see what reaction I get from him. Kath met her radiologist, yesterday, and likes her a lot. She'll do 30 zaps. She won't start until Feb. after the oncotype test. She said she would have ordered the test if her onc hadn't. So, we should know something thee 29th. All caught up. Off to finish the last class set of Story Analysis projects, so I can get them back to them next week. Progress grades are due the 26th. Have a good Saturday...and D1, I know you are busy preparing for the big event in D.C. Thinking of you. How's he Wellbutrin doing for you? SIS Kimberly",

All single occupancy prices.  Planet Hollywood was $464, but the amenities weren't as impressive as other hotels. Bellagio was $710 for Lakeview room. It had pool, spa, casino, restaurants, and shows. The Mirage will be under renovations starting in Feb. so, didn't think we wanted to deal with construction.   $512. Lots of ammenities. Mandalay Bay looks perfect: $473 includes taxes and fees. 11 acre sand and surf area with rentable cabana's plus a lazy river, D1, 3 swimming pools, jacuzzi, spa, fitness center, restaurants, casino, and on the strip for easy access to other hotels/casinos.  The rooms look really nice. Their new addition The Hotel at Mandalay is $595.40 excluding taxes and fees. It is connected by a walkway to the main hotel. Check it out. SIS ",

I did change my screen name to SIS Kimberly and in Privacy Settings I changed who can see my profile. No one outside of FB.  I will play with that more later. The game was AWESOME. Even though the Cardinals lost, I was jumping up and down and talking to the TV screen as if they could hear me, and totally getting into it as if I were a fan from way back. Fun. Those darned 96 yard worth of penalities really cinched it. Oh well, the fact they made it to the big game was huge, and congrats to the Steelers for the history making 6th SuperBowl...it is a year for history making isn't it?  Obama and the Steelers, and a Jewel meet and greet in July....the posibilities are endless. Oh, the ps is going to take fat from my gut and contour the hollow spots where a lot was removed from upper chest area if it gets approved, and my surgeon agrees I'm post menopausal according to the numbers, but like Dr. Northrop said on Oprah, not everyone's numbers mean the same thing. I still have hot flashes, so not sure I'm really post yet. The numbers for my FSH went up from the 50's to the 70's and my Estradiol is 11. You want high FSH and low Estradiol to be considered post menopausal.  I go back to the onc in March and to the surgeon in June. No scans or anything unless I have symptoms, so just a physical exam and blood work as my followup. Between my onc and my surgeon, I will be seen every three months by someone for 5 years.
