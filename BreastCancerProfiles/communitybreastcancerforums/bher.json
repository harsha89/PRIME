I am now using real cocoa butter as recommended by my RO and I really like it.  Hang in there, I know it is rough but it will get better after the rads is done.   ",

I started rads on Nov. 9th and will be done on Monday.  Yeah!  Good luck with your treatments. mjbmiller - I had bolus treatments also and it is different than the boosts.  I had bolus every other day with my regular txs and everytime with my boosts.  I was told bolus txs are usually given to mastectomy patients to bring the radiation closer to the skin.  Your skin may react more when using a bolus.  The boosts are extra treatments directed to the tumor area and are usually given at the end of the regular treatments. Good Luck!",

It is very challenging to wear clothes because of the bra situation.  You could try wearing a bra over a tank top so it does not rub on the skin.  The bandini type bras also may be more comfortable.  That helped me but very honestly I went without a bra for several weeks because my skin was so bad and did not go anywhere except for rads. I am using the Miaderm also and love it but halfway thru rads my skin/TE was so tight and red that I added Aquaphor many times a day and it was the product that helped me the most to get thru the rads. It helped to relieve the tightness of the tissue expander.  Good luck to you. Moyapeter - My RO and PS both recommended benadryl during rads mostly for itching and I took it without any problems.",

Rads was hard for me and I wanted to quit towards the end but I am glad that I didn't.  I am not sure when I will get the permanent implant, probably will be a few months at least.  It depends on how well my skin heals. After two weeks of being finish, I am not as tight.  Yes, get some Aquaphor but keep using the Miaderm too. Apply as many times as possible to keep the skin moist throughout the day. I got through this, you will too.",

Rads was hard on me too with an expander.  I finished about a month ago and even though it is still very tight, it is better.  My skin developed blisters too and the RO gave me Silvadene which helped.  I do not know much about what you can do about the tightness now unless you have your PS take a small amount of  fluid out.  They did this for me in the end (during my boosts) because I could not stand it and wanted to quit.  It helped to get me thru the rads but it got tight again.  The plan is to put the fluid back in but I just dont think I can do it now because I am still very uncomfortable. So sorry you have to go through this.",

It is very moisturizing and smells good (chocolate).",

Taking a break too would be good so your blisters can heal. Take care.",
