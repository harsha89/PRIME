Two days ago I had a lumpectomy/partial and SNL.  Felt great yesteday but feeling dizzy and nauseous this morning.  Did not come out of recovery easily and the anesthetic made me really sick, recovery for 3 hours for before I was discharged, almost admitted for observation.  2.38cm IDC in left breast, with negative SNL touchprep biopsy in surgey on 10/16.  Waiting for margins and pathology report.  ER/PR+, HER- My bowels are in turmoil with diarhea, blue dye, etc.  Wondering if anyone else can comment on the dizzyness?  Did not drink enough water yesterday for sure so starting to push fluids today. No significant pain so only taking Tylenol, so dizzy/sickness not narco related. About to call my surgeon's office to check in. Julie",
