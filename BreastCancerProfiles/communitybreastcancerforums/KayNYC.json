I am using the Hydrophor, same as Aquaphor and occasionally use the 100% Aloe Vera (Fruit of the Earth or CVS brand).The initial discomfort from GERD settled down after my Internist recommended I take an extra dose of my Protonix for a while. I alternate between using the sports bra and camisole. I have a small amount of swelling in my breast and axilla.  I will discuss this with my RadONC this week.I restarted  my yoga practice last week and since doing so, the underarm feels less swollen. I found a good yoga DVD online and ordered it (www.yogaforcancer.com) I am also waiting for the another DVD from Collage video ( concentration on arm stretches and upper body work). Well, its' time to get off to bed. I have to get to the treatment center by 7:30 AM and off to work afterward. Hang in there, Pink Warriors.

I have completed my PT/OT for the lymphedema this week and wear the compression sleeve and gaunlet to control the swelling. The sleeve is not covered by my insurance but I am appealing the decision since the only in- network company that measures and supplies the compression garments told me their fitter was away for a few weeks and I needed it before my flight to Fla. My last arm measurements showed that my affected arm is smaller in some places but just .5cm larger than my dominant arm at the top.The trunk edema seems better and alleviated by the Manual Lymph drainage that I was taught by my Pt/OT.Took my week vacation and had a wonderful time.I see my Med Onc and surgeion in Sept when I go for my six month mammo. Moving right along and trying to stay positive re: the Sept Mammo.",

The area is completely healed and the skin and incision are looking great.Saw the PT for evaluation for Lymphedema on Friday. She says I have a mild case and prescribed a compression sleeve and glove. I will be going on vacation on July 23 (flying to Fla.) so I am scrambling to get the sleeve (not many experienced fitters of the sleeves around, it seems). Very surprized that there are not many pharmacies/surgical suppliers around that carry the sleeves. PT warned me not to just have \"anyone\" measure me for the sleeve. I will meet with a fitter on Tuesday. The NP says she thinks my insurance will cover the cost of the sleeve. Hoping I fit a standard size and not have to worry about waiting for a custom order to arrive. Otherwise, I am feeling good. I started the Arimidex two weeks ago. Have had increased dry eyes that caused some blurred vision. Using GenTeal drops to keep my eyes lubricated; the blurred vision subsided. Looking forward to vacation and happy to be a Rad Grad..

I have mild LE in my upper left arm, breast and axilla. She suggested I use one particular fitter who seems not to be the office on many days of the week. She cautioned me not to just \"get one off the shelf\" and stressed the importance of proper fit.The PT taught me how to do the self massage and suggested I do exercises with the sleeve on however it will be days before I can see the fitter and I am feeling a bit frustrated. I am scheduled to fly to Florida in two weeks and time is limited in terms of taking off from work and trying out \"fitters\". Anyone know a good fitter in NYC, on the upper west side? Any suggestions regarding the most comfortable sleeves and glove? They look so cumbersome. Will I be able to type? Typing reports and evaluations is part of my job. Boy does it stink to have LE.",
