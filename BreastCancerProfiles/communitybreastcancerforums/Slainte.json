I'm having my hair colored red as this was my color before chemo. I wonder if I should tell him to go easy on the red if that color seems to be dominant in post chemo hair. I don't want to look like a fuzzy farm animal. :). Maybe an Easter Chick lol.",

So although the pathology says metastatic, it only means it has spread to one lymph node. It is NOT the same as stage IV metastatic disease, which means cancer has spread out of the lymph system to other parts of body, most commonly bone, liver, lung and brain.
