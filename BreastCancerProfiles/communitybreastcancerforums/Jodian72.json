I have to be careful when I shower not to rake the bar of soap over it.... that really hurts. LOL. But other than that, it's pretty simple. I just had those steri-strips on mine and didn't even have any internal stitches from it. The steri-strips fell off after about 3 or 4 days. Good luck... Jodi ",

When I lost my hair I stopped wearing it. I'm not completely sure why... maybe I didn't want the label to match the product? My dh brings me things all the time. It's really sweet and I think its part of his coping mechanism. I will admit that I bought pink ribbon slippers and a T-shirt. I wear the slippers all around the house, but have had a hard time wearing the t-shirt out. Again... don't want the label to match the product??? I guess for me, I don't care for the 'pity' looks.

I appreciate my chemo because it has made me feel better. I usually notice I'm really tired at about day 5 and it lasts for 4 or 5 days.

Today I received my 'official' diagnosis of breast cancer metastatic to the bone. I have spots on my spine, neck, hips, and ribs. Fortunately, no organ involvement. I was originally scheduled for mastectomy tomorrow, but of course that has now changed. I will start chemo a.s.a.p. Maybe as soon as this Thursday. I'm 6 mo. pregnant today, so it complicates the treatment a bit. At this point we will treat the cancer with chemo to 'hold it off' until the baby comes. Then we will treat more aggressively. I see a perinatologist on Wednesday as I'm a high risk pregnancy now. I'm 34 (35 the end of this month) and this is my first pregnancy. I'm feeling very positive about this whole thing. I'm not too worried as my onc seems very confident in my treatment. It's just scary with baby and all. I want my baby to be healthy when she is born. So that is all I can think of to share about me right now. Just thought I would step up and join you all.

About 5 minutes in to the taxol I felt like I had an elephant on my chest and realized I couldn't really breath. I had Zoe in my arms and passed her off to my hubby. I called the nurse and she came over and said, \"It's an allergic reaction.\" The whole staff 'sprung' into action. They were amazing! They started pumping me full of benadryl and then... the pain started. OMG... I thought my back was going to explode. It came in waves and hurt so bad I was white knuckling the chair. My DH freaked out (he always does) but the nurses calmed him down. They gave me a lot of morphine and it took nearly an hour for the pain to really subside. Needless to say, I don't remember much for the rest of the day... whoohoo, good drugs. LOL. So they said that this does happen, but I had and extremely severe reaction. How scary! Has this happened to anyone else and what did they change you to? I think we are looking into Taxotere now. Just another Jodi saga... I swear, I'm like a cockroach, you just can't kill me!!!!!
