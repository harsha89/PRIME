I was 55 at the time,little knowledge of bc as only one maternal aunt had experienced issues. Mine was discovered as microcals on a routine, yearly mammo. I had lumpectomy and mixed reactions abt the rads.I was so delighted that the radiologist saw shadows and encouraged more films as mine was very early. Three yrs later(come Oct of this yr),I have had very few side effects. The rads onc(I go to a large cancer ctr in my city)met with me and he suggested rads and did not really offer other options. Two of the three med personnel(with whom I dealt) said no rads.Although, then,I was not as familiar with the questions that I probably would ask now. I had non-comedo and low grade,wide negative margins and less than 3mm of DCIS and in only one area. However,I did have hyperplasia and ADH that was found in the stereotactic biopsy. Iam presently taking Arimidex as uterine cancer has been in my family history. Is Armidex the best med..that I am not sure abt? I still see a med onc every six months and will for probably five years,acc to my current dr.  So,bottom line would I do it,again? Probably so...although,I have let it go and cannnot second guess my choices now. However,you are so fortunate to be here and getting great opinions and suggestions for questions. I did not find this site until at least six months after all treatments were completed. I kept reading and re-reading and trying to make cases fit mine. I don't know if you do that,but I constantly read everything I could and worried.However,as time has gone on,the anxiety has lessened in many ways and meds have helped me. I found that the rads onc did not encourage questions rather answered them. Now,I would be more informed....20/20 hindsight!  One thing I have found with DCIS is that there are so many opinions and so many different types of DCIS. As Shirl said,they do leave the choices out there and we,patients,must decide which are the most appropriate treatments and that is challenging. JMO Best to you! I empathize as I know how I felt as I made up my mind and actually found this site in the middle of a night when I was Googling DCIS. It was a real blessing! I hope that things go well for you.
