I am also with the suggestion to hydrate, hydrate and hydrate.  I aimed for 4 liters of water on tx day and for two days after that, and then at least 2 liters each and every day.  I also loved the Biotene mouthwash.  I did get mouth sores even though I chewed ice during tx and the Biotene helps.  My taste buds are still whacked out 4 wks after last tx.  Previously I would recover them the week before the next tx.  I will warn you that although I did really well for tx's 1 thru 3, the last one kicked my butt.  I was able to continue to work, but after last tx had to take 3 days off to spend on the couch.  Have a little more energy now, but muscle aches and fatigue are still there.  My best advice is this:  when you feel crummy, lie down. When you need help, ask for it.  Don't keep SE secrets from your family, let them know exactly how you are doing so they can help.  Even though you may not feel like it, eat.  Even if its just a can of soup.  Little meals all day.  Try to get outside once a day, even for 5 minutes.  And moisturize!  Your skin will be very dry.  I use baby oil in the shower. I did not ice fingernails and two nails on my left hand are lifting from their beds.  Don't know if I will lose them completely, but it is something to be aware of. Also, I am still losing some eyebrow hairs. They are not gone, but are considerably thinner. Feel free to PM me anytime with a specific question, and best of luck to all of you!  I know you are frightened, but you will get through this and we will beat this disease!  HUGS",
