I'm trying to make it through my last three days of work 0before all my pre-ops start next week. I was diagnosed 9/30/18 and waiting for the surgery has been very stressful as I feel like the cancer is just spreading each day despite my doctors' reassurance. I'm glad that I found some fellow \"November breast mates\". I look forward to reading about all of your journeys and supporting you along the way.",

I have been remaining quiet on the posting but have very much enjoyed reading all of yours and learning of your progress. I had my BMX on November 15 with the TUG (transverse upper gracilis) reconstruction (they used the fat and gracilis muscle from my inner thighs to reconstruct my breasts). My surgery was a success and I have been home healing and feeling better each day. I am EXTREMELY pleased with the outcome as my breasts looked better than I had imagined with scarring only around the areola area as I requested. The scars on my legs are quite extensive and painful as they heal as I am not permitted to sit in a chair at 90 degrees hip flexion for 3 weeks post surgery for concern of ripping out the inner stitches. You can only imagine how difficult going to the bathroom is! I am now sleeping in my bed and spending days in my rented medical reclining chair. I can also walk with no problem (thank goodness) and stairs have become easier each day. I received the final pathology report and will begin meeting with oncologists the week of Dec. 10. As I did when selecting a medical surgeon, I am meeting with 3 different oncologists to get opinions and \"interview\" them before I make my selection. When I went through this process in selecting my medical surgeon, I received 3 completely different surgical recommendations. I was pretty surprised about that but selected the doctor whose ideology was most in line with mine and am grateful that I took the time to go through the \"interview\" process. I am curious and very nervous to hear the recommendations of the 3 different oncologists and wonder if they will all be consistent or varied. Many of us will be going through the oncology part of this journey together and I hope that you all continue to update and share your experiences as I have found all of your posts to be so informative. Be well!",
