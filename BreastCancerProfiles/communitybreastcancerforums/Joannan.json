The good news is that she is doing very well.  They said she had two, maximum six weeks, but every day she is getting a little better, not worse. She is home from hospital with palliative care, but is up and about, walking around and doing stuff. She had the Herceptin and is due for the next lot next Tuesday (three week cycle). The day I arrived (two weeks ago) she was really sick, jaundiced, very weak - unable to walk around much, on oxygen and coughing a lot with pleural effusion. for a few days we didnt believe she would be able to ever go home again. My sister in law had some water from Lourdes which we put on her and prayed for her. We took her shopping on the Friday in a wheel chair to buy something special for her daughter's birthday. On the Sunday she went to church (in wheel chair) to attend a little bithday party they put on for her daughter...she stayed for the service and received prayer.  Each day after that she started to improve a little. By the time she came home a few days back, she was off oxygen, walking as much as I was, out of the wheel chair, still a little jaundiced but doing well. She has some degeneration in her spine which looks like osteoperosis - old ladies hump, and very much needs to get onto the bone strengthening stuff. Still very frail....dont know what the future holds, but for now it's looking very good. I will update you when there's more news. Thank you so much for your support ladies. Im so glad that this is the news I can bring :) Log in to post a reply",

Very sad...it's a long story which I will tell in another post. My sister has asked me if you ladies could please post a list of treatments used for mets (especially liver). She has been all natural...went onto Halotestin for spine mets in about June. She has been very sick, nausea, couldnt eat, lost a lot of wieght...that has been going on for a few months. She lives a long way from me. Anyhow, she has finally taken herself to hospital (last night) emergency...they admitted her immediately and began to rehydrate her. She had a ct scan yesterday which has shown extensive mets to the liver..they have told her her liver is breaking down. She wanted a list of treatments people have had....can you please put them up so I can text them to her, she wants to have them on hand when she sees the onco. She is now getting proper treatment.....I am so furious with her stupid GP who didnt have her admitted to hospital weeks ago....she was so sick she couldnt get off the couch...I am so angry. I know there is hope and have sent her todays link about liver mets.....I just hope it's reversible. Anyhow, long story but want to get this up for responses....thank you jo  Log in to post a reply",
