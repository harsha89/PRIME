My own life has not been without its own drama.  All was going well..we welcomed identical twin boys and a little girl in the fall, they are the new generation of our family.  Although Mom missed their arrival, we have all enjoyed watching them grow. On the 4th May, I was asked to speak at our relay for life about Mom.  That night a gnat flew up my nose.  Although I thought I got it out, I woke up the next morning with a headache.  I thought it was my sinuses and treated it as such.  The headache got progressively worse and by Monday I was in acute pain.  I was able to see my family doctor, and she thought I was having a migraine.  She arranged a base line MRI.  She was able to get it on Wednesday.  After the MRI my dr showed up at the hospital and told me that they had found a small brain tumor. I heard 3mm.  I was able to get into one of the top Neurosurgeons the next day, and learned that what I thought was a small 3mm tumor was actually a small 3.5 cm tumor.  His concern was that it was pressing on my spinal cord, and that the tumor that showed like this usually was from a metastases. So...On the following Monday, I was having brain surgery.  This journey has been truly blessed all the way.  The tumor turned out to be benign, atypical meningioma who II.  Dr B was not able to remove it all so I will be having radiation to shrink the remainder.  I am doing well, and I realize that the journey I experienced with Mom helped prepare me for my own journey.  There is still a chance that the radiation could leave some damage to my brain, although there is a 44% chance of the tumor growing back if I don't have the treatment and that could damage it as well..  I have given this whole journey over to my God, in doing so I have been placed in the hands of some amazing caregivers.  I know that worry and speculation will not change the outcome.  I can only imagine the lives my journey will touch, and hope that it enriches them for the better.  Each of you have passed on courage, and determination as a gift to all who read about your journeys.  Thank you for sharing.  Holding you all in prayer and gentle hugs. Terri CAEarl's Daughter.",
