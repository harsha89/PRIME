I was really curious about how the expanders were and the numbness I'd experience.  I imagine everyone is.  The expanders feel like an uncomfortable bra.  Right after surgery I remember thinking I must be wrapped really tight under this outter gause wrap but, when I went in for my 1 week appointment they took off the outer gause wrap and that's all the wrap there was.  The tight wrap feeling was from the expanders.  At this point, 4 months later, I don't notice them too much unless I'm moving my arms around.  But I for sure still feel them.  I'm hoping the implants won't be like this.  I was really worried about the numbness and if I'd be able to tolerate it.  I hated the sensation I had in my legs after the epidural when my kids were born.  It's not as bad as I expected though.  I mean, it is totally numb but it's okay.  At first I couldn't handle touching my new breasts.  It just made every fiber in me freek out.  The PS said that was common and that I needed to make myself touch them as frequently as possible.  He said it's because the nerves around the numb area are all confused and need \"rewiring.\"  So I did and it worked.  Over the past couple months I've been able to touch them nomally without stress.  So, feel yourselves out ladies.  The PS said that experience of nerve overload will only get worse if you don't.  It's kind of odd now, that the area is still just as numb but I don't really notice it being.  I suspect my fingers interpret the touch to my brain and it's not as obvious to me that they're numb at all.  I had no use for the cami the hopstial gave me.  Honestly you wouldn't have gotten me to put that thing on in a million years.  For the first month or two all I wore was the very softest, stretchest tank tops I could find, with zip fron hoody over if needed.  I tried to put a loose sports bra on but that too felt awful to me.  And honestly, there's no point in the world to wearing any kind of bra after surgery.  These expanders are so very hard and they're not moving.  They have softened up a bit now in month 4 though. Oh, when I went in for my 1 week appointment I didn't realize she was going to take all the wrap off and leave it off.  They took the tubs out at the same time.  It all just moved more quickly than I was expecting and I got really light headed and had to lay down.  It was a bit of an out of body experience when I first looked down.  Of couse I hadn't eaten much and I have low blood pressure.  BTW, you probably won't eat much the first couple weeks after surgery.  We had some jello and chicken soup packets that I lived on.  I drank a lot of water though which is suppose to help with so many things in recovery. The \"fills\" in the expanders were weird.  People vary in how they handle the experience.  There's nothing actually painful about it, at least not for me.  The numbness keeps you from feeling anything.  It's just so soon after surgery and my nerves in my breast area were all confused.  It's weird to have a needle go in and not be able to feel it.  You can sense some pressure to it though.  I had to lay down and hold my husbands hand.  But I'm kind of a wimp.      I'll be honest, the surgery wasn't easy for me.  But I did it.  And I have no regrets.  I'm not sure what caused it, maybe pain meds, but I had trouble in hosptial with shaking uncontrollably.  If I had to lift an arm or leg or anything I'd start shaking and my teeth would start chattering.  And I wasn't even cold.  I haven't heard others with that experience though, so I think it was a unique reaction of mine.  I thought I'd be able to go home the next day but I ended up there for 3 days.  There was no problems really, I just wasn't adjusting physically.  I was expecting to pop right out of it since I'm only 40 and I'm in really good physical condition.  I think it was just my reaction to the drugs.  But still, it was a managable experience. At home in recovery I remember feeling helpless and weak physically for the first week or two.  But still I was out on the couch and talking with visiters and interacting.  I started going for walks outside 5 or so days after surgery, just short ones at first.  I remember the sunlight and fresh air felt wonderful.  My husband was a saint in helping me.  The first week, while I still had my drains, I'd stand in the shower, without the shower on, and he'd take washclothes and soap and wash and rinse my body for me.  Even after my drains were out he showered with me because I couldn't wash my hair and I couldn't handle the water running over my chest at first.  A couple times that first week he washed my hair in the sink., which felt so wonderful. A few more things for sure...ask for as much anti nausia meds as you can during surgery (I did and I didn't throw up at all) and ask for some anti nausia drugs to take home (I had a couple dizzy nausia spells the first few days at home) and take the stool softeners (no amount of fiber will do it) and keep up with the pain meds the first week even at night.  Don't feel bad about taking the pain meds.  After a couple weeks you'll be able to manage without them.  Sorry to be so long winded.  I hope some things here have been helpful to someone.  I hope everyone's surgeries go well.       ",
