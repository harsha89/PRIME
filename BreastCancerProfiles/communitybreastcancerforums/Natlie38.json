I have only been using normal disposable Schick razors before my mastectomy. Do you think its ok for me to use the 'normal' schick's razors with all the Hibiclens precautions or would you advice safety razor's only? Thank you for your time and advice. ",

Haven't shaved since mastectomy, didn't need to. chemo was taking care of that part! Thanks Nats, TMM for your inputs. ",

And the nurses had told me they cannot use my left arm since that's the side they are operating. Anyway after some phone calls at my surgeons office, I made sure they use my left arm only at the time.  I also took print outs of \"No BP, No IV line\" on Right arm and had my husband post it above my bed in the hospital.  I know the looks on the nurses when you say No BP or IV on either arm. so for me after the surgery, they started taking BP on my leg. The nurses told me an IV line in the leg is not so secure/stable. God knows what that means!! But I know you don't want to mess with the people taking care of you in the hospital.  Its a difficult situation. Even though I don't have lymphedema on my left side, the risk remains (4 nodes out). I use my left arm for blood draws and I have been refusing BP measuring all together for routine doctor visits. (Not a great idea I know!) I have no clot issues or bilateral LE, so I know I am not helping you with the answers that you are seeking. Still just wanted to write and let you know I can understand your dilemma! Best wishes.",
