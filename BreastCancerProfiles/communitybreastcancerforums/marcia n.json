I had sentinal node biopsy in Nov, followed chemo and then unclear lumpectomy in March. Thanks, and I hope you all are doing better each day.  Marcia",

I NEVER thought I'd be going through this.  Maybe this is payback for thinking I'd always be the healthy one who holds the others up!  The cancer itself never bothered me one bit, it's the treatment that is so rough and archaic.  I hope by the time our kids are our age, no one will have to go through this.  I've lost my hair, some of my fingernails and now a breast (I was told from day one that it would be a simple and small lumpectomy.  THe mastectomy was a big blow).  During chemo I felt I was loosing myself.  There were some very dark days despite the support from family and friends.  Sometimes I felt I was ready to call it quits. I had my post op appt, and no surprises.  My skin sparing mx was on May 15.  Still  have a drain.  Expander still driving me nuts, but healing well. Take care! Marcia",

Ktn, I saw my PS today and got the drain removed!  YAY!  He was noncomittal about discomfort level.  \"Everyone's different\", you know they all say that.  When it gets bad or before it gets bad, he tells me to take a half an ativan.  That works, just afraid of addiction--he tells me not to worry.  I ran it by my bs, who agrees it's OK to take ativan if I need to.  So ativan it is.  Just knowing I can fall back on that makes me feel like I'll get through this.  I probably wont need to take it much. lisa, thanks for letting me know your skin was also tender.  I hadn't heard that before.  Good to hear that part gets better.  I'll have my first fill next week. lynn, I've heard of a number of people having recon after rads.   I had chemo, but didn't have to do rads.  My ps said he does a lot of recon post rads.  How long will you have to wait after rads to have the exchange?
