My cousin and his wife both took that and quit over 3 years ago..I also have the book by Allen Carr titled\" Easy way to stop smoking.\".I know a woman that quit after reading it...between the pills and the book I am heading in the right direction, so I bought my last (carton) yesterday...normally I would have bought 5 for the month..but I will pat myself on the back...I only bought 1 !!!!! so within a week I will have finished the book, been on the pills for a few days.....and smoked the carton.....then I will (with Gods blessing) QUIT.      Please wish me luck....I am not a very strong willed person..... but I want to try.       P.S. I will pray for good results for you my friend, and be checking in on you after the 13th                                           . love Tayreb",
