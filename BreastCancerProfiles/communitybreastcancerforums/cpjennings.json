In no way am I saying you have breast cancer, but what I am saying is please don't let not being insured and fear halt you from going to get checked out.  Go to emergency....that's their job...they have to see you! I'm currently in treatment.  I have a great Oncologist.  All of my prescriptions are fully covered as well as all of my treatments!  I'm provided transportation to and from my Dr. whenever I need it.  This has taken a load off of my husband and I because I can get the optimum care I need while he continues to work to keep our bills paid. As for your daughter, she's probably afraid and feeling very emotional right now with the new babies and everything.  Try not to stress over that......get yourself checked out!  It may be nothing, but if it's something, there's help available for you....please, please go to emergency........when I went, they did a breast scan and the attending ER Physician saw something and immediately called over to the main hospital and consulted with the Dr. who is not my Oncologist!  GET CHECKED OUT AND PLEASE LET ME KNOW.   ",
