I had a heart breaking conversation with my 9 year old tonight. She keeps a lot of her feelings in (she is a very private person) and at her doctors appointment today she told her doctor that sometimes she worries about things. She was not specific about what worries her but he gave her coping skills that she could practice. So I asked her about the conversation with her doctor...at first it was about school and then it came out that she is worried that I am going to leave her and the family. She cried for quite a while as I tried to hug and console her. I told her that I did well with chemo, the surgery went well and I plan on continuing to do as well as I can. The conversation was so hard....I feel horrible that the kids even have to worry about this....this is when this whole experience feels surreal again. On a positive note....Today I was calling around to find a compression sleeve for my arm (which has been surprisingly hard to find) and I called this local company. The woman on the other end of the phone asked me about my situation and then asked if she could share some \"hope\" with me. I didn't know what to expect because I have found that people can provide an assortment of \"hope\" or stories that I could have done without...Anyway, she told me that she was a 22 year survivor and that if I ever needed anyone to talk to or just wanted to be encouraged to call her. Honestly, this woman was like an angel...and I needed that positive vibe this morning. I enjoy survivor stories. ",

The anticipation of the test was tough...I tried to stay positive but there were moments that my mind took me to dark places. Fortunately, the scans came back with positive results. I have a bulging disc in my back (that I never knew I had) which added up for the pressure in my spinal cord. The internal mammary node was not even mentioned on the scan (which the nurse practitioner I spoke to thought was a good thing) which means radiation is working. I have 3 weeks of radiation remaining and the results gave me incentive to stay strong. On the hair front.....it is coming back steadily. I used to have very curly hair but right now it appears straight. I cannot wait until my hair is long enough to style or go without a hat! I hope that everyone is doing well.",

I remember the doctors saying maybe it was \"fibroids\" and the tech just rubbing my arm saying maybe they found it early enough.

I was planning on immediate reconstruction but that plan came to a screeching halt bc my internal mammary node needs radiation and the doctors are suggesting I hold off and have tissue expanders instead. I knew that I needed radiation but this has put my plans on hold. I meet with another radiation oncologist next Monday for a second opinion. The steroids have me up right now and I am having continuous hot flashes...last round, I can do this! Good luck to everyone -",

Smilethrupa - I did ask about the time with the doctors and they felt very comfortable with the amount of healing time. I am having my surgery at MGH and the doctors had no concerns. Trust me, I did ask b/c I had concerns. Thank you for thinking of me. So now on the schedule....many hydration visits, herceptin infusion on 1/24, some fun in the sun on 1/25, and then back for surgery. A friend gave me a gift card for a massage so I am going to work that in at some point. Best wishes to everyone that is finishing chemo and now moving onto the next step of this long journey!

The drains lasted for about 2-3 weeks (that was quite a learning experience). The pathology report came back very positive which made me pretty happy. I just started physical therapy 2 weeks ago to get my arm feeling better (they removed 21 lymph nodes on the left side and I still feel numb and tight). I did my radiation mapping today and that begins next week on 3/29 until 5/8. I am still on Herceptin every 3 weeks and that will be until some time in September. Overall, I am feeling pretty good. My energy is coming back and I am trying to exercise as often as I can. I am really look forward to radiation working for me and hearing the cancer free words. I wish everyone well!!!

I am still continuing with Herceptin but I have 3 more rounds to go. September 13th is my last treatment....I stay focused on this bc it seems like it is the light at the end of a very long tunnel! My diagnosis date was 8/25/16...my family and I were camping when I received the phone call that completely changed our lives. So this year, I am throwing a party on 8/26 to thank all of the people that have helped and supported my family. Originally I called it a \"life celebration\" but my husband said that sounded like a living funeral....so then I went with \"Holy s&@- I am still alive\" and he deemed that inappropriate and uncomfortable....so I went with a BBQ. I want to make a good memory of this date. Regarding ports...I was told that my port would most likely stay in for a while after treatment ends. Is that normal? Mentally, I am fine but pretty fearful of a reoccurrence. I continue to take Ativan for my anxious moments. I have noticed that I get anxious when I have to go back to the hospital. I have thought about counseling just to process this past year. I have taken the motto \"Live today\" when my mind starts to wander.... I am still continuing PT to stretch out my arm / chest and for lymphatic massages. My exchange surgery is set for Nov.21st (talk about an insurance plan to get out of Thanksgiving duties). Well, I hope and pray that all of you are well and enjoying life. I was happy to see the group was active!!! Have a great summer  ",

It was funny, when the doctor called me with the results she was taken back by my elation regarding a slipped disc...but I am so fearful of it coming back. Please know that I am thinking of you and your family. Please take care of yourself so you can be strong.",

I was diagnosed at the end of August and started chemo on September 20th. The first couple of days I felt like a rock star but the chemo kicked my rear end (literally) for almost a week. I had fluids a couple of times the week after chemo to stay hydrated. I finally feel really good but I start my 2nd round next Tuesday.... This has really been a surreal time. The hardest part was telling my girls and trying to stay positive and protect them. I have 8 year old identical twins, a 5 year old, and a 3 year old. The twins reacted differently with one crying when I told her and 1 crying the next day. I know they are worrying so I try to be as open as possible for them to ask questions. The 5 year old and 3 year old are concerned about one thing....my hair. They are too funny and their happiness keeps me happy. Speaking of my hair. I have really thick curly hair but it is thinning out and my guess is that it will be out very soon. My hair dresser (who is a breast cancer survivor) is on stand by. I am on the fence about wigs but I have been stock piling hats. If you had told me that this would be my current reality back in early August I would have had said \"no way\"...Amazing how life can change in a flash. One good thing did come out of this....my genetics test came back negative. I worried about my girls (and will still worry) but at least that gave me some peace for them.",

I am overly cautious to declare myself a survivor because to me that means that I have made it and it is all over. Seeing that I still have 3 treatments and surgery in my future...I would say I am \"surviving\"...Even if I am here 20 years from now, I will probably not declare myself a survivor (but that is just me...I have no problem with people declaring themselves a survivor). Warrior means (to me) someone that has made it though a mental and physical battle....a warrior is also strong and humble. I would say that we are all warriors because we have battled through some real serious shit this past year and we are still fighting through it. Again, just my opinion. Regarding nails....my finger nails are so brittle. I keep them cut short because they are constantly breaking. My feet, I keep getting hang nails. They hurt! I went to my first social event for the a local bc foundation near me. It was a bit overwhelming but it is a young survivor group (there's that word again) so it was nice to meet people that are close to my age. I am not going to lie....I cried all the way home. I think the tears were a mix of \"how did I get here\", \"how is this my life\", \"dear god, please don't let it come back\", and being tired. I have a long week of appointments next week and that always makes me anxious. I went for a very long walk today!",

I have to have a pity party for a moment....I am a teacher but I have taken the year off to tackle this new life challenge that has been thrown at me. Last night I went to a retirement party for my boss. I had a blast when I was there but boy, has it hit me hard this morning. I miss my pre-cancer life so much. I miss my job, my co-workers, and students. It was hard seeing everybody...I just have a hard time with the \"why\" of this situation. There have been so many changes in my life in this past month that I think they all just hit me. On Thursday, my long curly hair came out like crazy. I did my hair as as usual but by 8 p.m. it had become matted and almost like a dread lock. I texted my hairdresser (who is a friend) to see what I should do with it. Well, it became wicked itchy (so itchy that I had goosebumps), I tried to take a shower and condition the living daylights out of it but nothing worked. I had my husband cut off my huge dread...it was very sad for me. I had the rest of my hair shaved off yesterday. I went for the longest walk yesterday to accept the situation and move on. I am really nervous for round 2 on Tuesday. This past round had me feeling pretty bad for a while. I finally feel great again but I know that is about to come to an end. By Monday night, I will have the cleanest house in Massachusetts (due to stress / and the fact that I can have control over that).... Okay, pity party / venting over.

Well, this has been a process! I called the National Passport Agency because in the photo directions it stipulates that head covers / hats cannot be worn for the passport photo unless it is for religious reasons. So when I called the agency, after pressing every number possible to get a real person, I explained my situation. The woman told me that I could write a letter explaining my situation but she didn't know if it would work because hats are technically used for vanity purposes. So, I took a picture with my hat / beanie and wrote my letter.....hopefully it will work. I am really hoping I do not have to submit a picture of me and my bald head!!!!",

Regarding hair - I am as bald as they come! I am not on AC but I lost my hair about 16 days into treatment. Surprisingly enough (and knock on wood)...I still have eye brows and eye lashes. ",

My hair is coming in and I am finally comfortable enough to go without a hat. My update...I am still on herceptin every 3 weeks. I have had some scans with positive results which was quite a relief. I finished radiation 3 weeks ago and my skin is healing pretty well (I had a wicked burn under my arm from the radiation). We went on a family trip to FL which was well needed. I pretty much stayed under a cabana the whole time but the kids had a blast and it was a great week. My period returned and that was absolutely crazy. It started off okay but turned very heavy...I was glad that I had one but I was glad to see it go. I started tamoxifen on May 17th...and so far I am doing fine. I am doing PT 2x a week to keep my arm loose and my lymphatic system moving. I plan on my exchange surgery sometime...I am seeing the surgeon on Wednesday so hopefully a date will be set. Overall, I am doing pretty well. I am trying to lose weight and stay in shape. I have been tired but I try to continue on.... Well, I hope everyone is well. Best wishes!",

So, I have to ask, what is a z injection? Nayda985...I am right with you on always checking. I even find myself taking deep breathes to make sure all is good. I have heard so much about mets lately that it scares the daylights out of me (I guess that is where the ativan comes into play!) Hahlyn - I am sorry that you had some setbacks. Never feel embarrassed...we are all here for each other. I hope that you feel support with this group. Hang in there with radiation...it sucks but you can do it! It goes by much faster than chemo... Docmama - Very interesting info on the Nerlynx. Pretty neat that your doctor was involved with the study. I am going to discuss the drug with my doctor next week. I am interested to hear her take on it. Awesome that you have 1 herceptin treatment remaining! I am really happy for you! It sounds as if things are going well! Misslil - I hear you on the whole weight thing. I have been exercising a lot more but there are just some days that I am just physically beat. I don't even know what to blame the fatigue on...chemo...radiation...tamoxifen...life... Stay well everyone.",

Being diagnosed with BC is never easy and it sucks but you can get through this.

I think my twins had an idea that something was up only because there were some changes that were not normal (like I was not going to coach their soccer team and some other stuff). I called their pediatrician before I told them because I wanted to make sure I said the right things. I held off telling them for a while only because I did not have the heart to tell them but I finally told them the weekend before my first round of chemo. The older two cried because the news was scary, the younger two were like okay....can we go play?!? I have tried to keep an open line of communication with the kids and I tell them when chemo is coming up so they know what to expect. It has been hard to say \"breast cancer\" to them and we do not say it often. I have lost my hair and that was hard for the older 2. The younger 2 like to rub my head.... This will not be an easy year for you but you will be ok. You will do everything in your power to do well for your kids because that is what mom's do. There will be days that you are tired and don't want to move off the couch...but you will because kids are very motivating and the mom power will kick in. Hang in there, you got this!",
