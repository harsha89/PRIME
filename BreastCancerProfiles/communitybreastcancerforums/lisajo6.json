I started abraxane and herceptin in February. This is the first time I looked at it. I am devastated. I don't even know what half of it means. IMPRESSION: 1. NECK: No FDG avid neoplastic process. No hypermetabolic mass, adenopathy, or fluid collection. 2. CHEST: Progression of hypermetabolic thoracic lymphadenopathy. No hypermetabolic mass or fluid collection. 3. ABDOMEN/PELVIS: New hypermetabolic hepatic metastases. New hypermetabolic abdominal lymphadenopathy. New hypermetabolic peritoneal implant. 4. EXTREMITIES/SKELETON: Progression of hypermetabolic osseous metastatic disease.

INDICATION: Study performed for subsequent treatment strategy. TECHNIQUE: F18-FDG administered IV was followed about 60 minutes later by PET imaging from eyes to proximal thighs. Free breathing low dose CT was performed without contrast for attenuation correction and anatomic localization. Blood glucose before FDG injection: 134 mg/dL FDG radionuclide dose: 12 mCi CT Dose-Length Product (DLP): 473 mGy*cm. COMPARISON: FDG PET/CT dated 2/28/2017 CORRELATION: None. RESULT: NECK: Physiologic FDG uptake seen in the visualized brain, parapharyngeal soft tissues, base of tongue, vocal cords, and salivary glands. No hypermetabolic cervical lymphadenopathy or masses. No focal hypermetabolic thyroid lesion. CHEST: Physiologic FDG uptake in the heart and mediastinum. Lungs and tracheobronchial tree: No hypermetabolic consolidation, mass or nodules. Pleura: No hypermetabolic pleural or pericardial effusion, or pleural mass. Mediastinum and Lymph nodes: Several new sites of hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy are seen, including the upper right paratracheal (maximum SUV 11.7), left subpectoral (maximum SUV 2.6), and a 2.7 x 2.1 cm left axillary lymph node (maximum SUV 13.7). There has been interval resolution of the previously seen hypermetabolic lower right paratracheal adenopathy. Chest wall: Status post right mastectomy with flap reconstruction and right axillary lymph node dissection. ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Physiologic FDG uptake seen in the GU and GI tracts. Liver: Multiple new intensely FDG avid lesions are seen throughout the liver, compatible with hypermetabolic hepatic metastases. For example: - 4.0 x 3.9 cm FDG focus in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe (maximum SUV 16.1, slice position 325), - 5.2 x 4.3 cm FDG focus in the anterior segment of the right hepatic lobe (maximum SUV 12.8, slice position 342), and - 3.3 x 3.0 cm FDG focus in the right hepatic lobe inferiorly (maximum SUV 11.6, slice position 395). Biliary: No bile duct dilation. Spleen: No mass. No splenomegaly. Pancreas: No mass or duct dilation. Adrenals: No mass. Kidneys: No stones, hydronephrosis, or hypermetabolic lesions. GI tract: No dilation or wall thickening. Lymph nodes: New hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy is seen, including the periportal (maximum SUV 8.7), portacaval (maximum SUV 8.6), aortocaval (maximum SUV 5.9), left para-aortic (maximum SUV 10.6), and left common iliac regions (maximum SUV 8.6). Mesentery/Peritoneum: There is a new FDG avid 9 x 7 mm soft tissue nodule in the left upper pelvis (maximum SUV 2.6, slice position 524), compatible with hypermetabolic peritoneal implant. Vasculature: Vascular patency cannot be assessed due to lack of IV contrast. BONES AND EXTREMITIES: There has been an interval increase in FDG avidity by the sclerotic lesion of the upper sternal body (maximum SUV 4.5, previously 2.5). Multiple new hypermetabolic osseous lesions are seen, including the right humeral head (maximum SUV 5.9), left acromion (maximum SUV 3.7), multiple thoracic vertebrae (for example maximum SUV 5.6 associated with T3 vertebral body), multiple lumbar vertebrae, sacral body (maximum SUV 4.8), several additional sites in the bony pelvis, and both proximal femora. These findings are compatible with progression of hypermetabolic osseous metastatic disease. ====== There is no component information for this result. 01/26/2018 2:31 PM 01/26/2018 3:10 PM Brian R Murphy, MD Final result Back to the Test Results List ",

I have never had a liver biopsy since I was diagnosed last June. I want to live longer than a few months. I thought abraxane was really good for liver mets-but apparently not for me. Like for all of us, it is a constant worry and battle.",

Fortunately I just had a cat scan, MRI if my head, and blood work done, so I will have everything in a folder for her. I am interested in finding out more about Y90.

He felt my liver a week and a half ago and said it felt smaller and softer. I also had ascites-most of it is gone but the muscles on my sides are sore and feel like they are pulling. Plus my lower back hurts when I get up. I can walk okay. I also had two hospital stays for bleeding ulcers which I swear were caused by Doxil. Horrid drug. Anyway, I am scheduled to get chemo tomorrow if my counts are okay. I feel really good, and have been able to live again. I also had a tram flap years ago so my tummy does not have a lot of support. I guess I need some hope. My liver is scaring me. I don't even make plans to do anything unless it is the last minute. I am just babbling, but I am so nervous. Like everyone else-I want to live for my grandsons.  Lisa",
