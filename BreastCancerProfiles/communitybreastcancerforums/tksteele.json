While I have the energy I am going to fix and freeze as many vegan meals as I can and put in my freezer. I have alot to do this week before I start chemo on April 1. Im sure you all do. It seems overwhelming at times. So I just take one day at a time and breath.  Keep calm and Fight on!",

I'm exausted getting ready for this.  Making sure I have everything I need and organized. Were told each person is diffrent with the side effects. I have epilespy with grand mal seizures and this makes me nervous.  I am starting a yoga class soon and working on my Medatation also.  I am greatful for all your post and friendship. ",

My sister is going with me this week to get a wig. I was told by a friend to shave my head myself or have someone do it for me. That way I have control and not the cancer.  I'm not sure how this will go.  I have been reading the other threads and they have been very helpful on what to stock up on and other advice. I had my port surgery yesterday and it went well. Everything seems to be a wirlwind of info and speeding right along. It's very scary. I would like things to slow down a  little. I am starting back at the YMCA next month. I like the yoga class and the walls are closing in on me here at home.  I have good and bad moments. I started a journal a friend that had cancer said this really helped her. Keep in touch.",
