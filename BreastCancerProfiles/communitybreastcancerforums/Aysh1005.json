My mother in law was diagnosed with the same thing 8 weeks ago which made me check myself.... I found a lump so went to gp who said it felt like a cyst (I had a mommogram 3 years ago which turned out to be cysts) went to breast clinic had mammogram and ultra sound from there had a biopsy they told me it was classed as 'probably benign' and the nurse told me I had nothing to worry about.... telephone call the following week to ask me to come in same afternoon where I was told my results. Life has been a roller coaster of emotions since then more so for my family..... I've had a couple of meltdowns but trying to live on humour at the moment. There are so many unknowns at the moment which I'm finding is the hardest part to deal with. I'll be having a lumpectomy on the 29th September, I'm so glad I have found this site as I have found so much information helpful already. Love to you all ",
