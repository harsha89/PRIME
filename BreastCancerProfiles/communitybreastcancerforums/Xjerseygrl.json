I called my pcp and requested a copy of my pathology report and it has helped me get prepared for my appointment next week. I'm glad you joined as there is such a wealth of information to help us get thru this. I hope this helps you decide what is right for you....I agree with kaya the more information we have the better prepared we are to make important decisions regarding our treatment.",
