Still there, it's hard, doesn't move, no pain, and I have some bloody discharge from that nipple:( I seen my Dr Friday and he is sending me for an ultrasound ASAP and a mammogram second, if needed. I am so so scared! My doc seemed really concerned, which made me even more afraid of what this could be. Anyone else have this and no cancer? Any suggestions, stories, tips? Thank you:)  Log in to post a reply",

The Dr that did my ultra sound was in and out in 5 minutes:( he put the ultrasound wand on my breast for maybe 30seconds and said nothing is wrong and you are too young to be worried about BC... And then walked out! I was in shock!  Now the lump that I had feels different, maybe bigger but it almost feels larger and holy... I don't know how to describe it, it feels like a bunch of little pebbles now instead of just one. I don't know what to do... Any advice? Log in to post a reply",

I really hope it's nothing, but my gut keeps telling me to get it figured out!  I just have this weird feeling something is not right! I have never felt this sense of urgency  before... I will also look into the \"second opinion\" section:) Thank you:) ",
