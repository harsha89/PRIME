And I hear about all the complications/discomfort from implants, which makes me want to go with DIEP.  I'm so confused.  :(  And, yes, I obsess about this.  I want to make my decision and move on, although I don't really want to get closer to surgery, either....  I'm scared.  I don't want to do anything, yet I want to do something quickly!  It's so conflicting, I know.  And I know no one can give me the answer, but thanks for letting me vent!",

Just know that this is a great place to come and let your feelings out without having to feel you are bothering anyone!  Are you seeing a psychiatrist for your depression rather than your primary doctor?  I think it's important you see someone to get that under control who really deals with that specifically and effectively. You've made a smart decision to change your ps. You know when something is wrong. Hopefully this CAT scan will provide some answers. You will get through this and find happiness!  And you're doing the right thing to keep seeking answers because there will be a solution. So my advice is to pursue a psychiatrist if you're not seeing one already to take care of your depression more effectively, then move forward, as you already are, with your concerns with your pain. You will get through this!  This, too, shall pass!",

These antidepressant medications should be administered by a psychiatrist, not your PCP.  Ask for a referral if you need to. Once you get the proper dosage/ medication, things will become more manageable!  There are great meds out there, but your psychiatrist should be the one managing those.  Hang in there! Marinasnow, do you have someone you can call, such as a family member?  Does your doctor know how you're feeling emotionally?  I would call someone and let them know how you're feeling. Do you have any depression medications you're taking, and, if so, have you altered the dose or just never really found the right med/dosage?",

Good luck to you, and I wish you all the best!",
