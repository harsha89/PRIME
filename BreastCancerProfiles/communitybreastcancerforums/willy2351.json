Now I have a fluid filled breast (my fluib ) on the left side.  Pre-mastectomy I was a 36B.  My left breast is now an A cup.  (And much more pert than my 60 year old B cup) My medical onc and radiation onc say there's nothing that can be done and this is the way my breast will be from now on, but I wonder... I have neuropathy in both hands and arms but I'm pretty sure I don't have lymphodema. Has anyone else had this experience?  The oncs say it's lymph fluid.  I just wonder about lymph fluid  hanging around.... Any insights or suggestions or voices of experience (jokes are fine, too)  would be appreciated. Thank you! Debbi DX TNBC 9/09; age 59 Stage III, Grade 3 Two tumors; pos node(s?)
