Doc said could be a \"colloid cyst\", which she said was benign.  I, of course, couldn't stay off the internet and looked it up and all I could find was that it was an invasive type of cancer.  Anyone know anything about \"colloid cysts\"?  I am so tired of this- it's dragged on way too long.  Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "cmdw wrote: Hi- A year ago I had a breast biopsy with an inconclusive pathology- said couldn't rule out MALT lymphoma.  It was followed up 1 month and then 4 months later with diagnostic mammo.  All the tissue had been removed and there was no regrowth.  Following that I had a PET/CT scan (I insisted on it) which showed a \"10 by 8mm spiculated nodular density - this is not clearly hypermetabolic\".  It was assumed at the time that it was the area that had been biopsied, so the surgeon was not overly concerned and wanted to watch and wait stating it could be from the \"trauma\" from the biopsy.  Apparently the clips from the biopsy don't show up on CT and he had forgotten? the whole lesion was removed.  He said he wanted to redo the PET in 5 months, but never ordered it.  He never actually read the report to me.  I've had several mammos and sonograms since, but nothing was compared to the CT/PET.  It wasn't until I got my hands on my report that I realized the biopsied lesion was completely removed BEFORE the CT/PET and the abnormality was on the opposit side of my breast.  I brought it to my gyn's attention during a routine exam and gave him both the pathology and scan reports and he is sending me to an oncologist for another opinion and recommending I dump my current surgeon as he has been \"negligent\".  I am a worried mess.  The mass had shown up on a mammo 3 years ago, but not on the ones in between,  then on my last one 2 weeks ago. Apparently I wasn't compressed the same each time.  3 years ago they followed it after 6 months and it showed no change.  For over 2 years I've had pain in that breast and an intense itching in the nipple.  Anyone ever heard of MALT lymphoma of the breast, or possibly an extranodal growth reaction to a breast cancer?  Could a breast cancer be present for 3 years with no apparent change in size?  The PET also showed greater uptake in my left ovary.  That was never addressed at all.  I had cervical cancer 4 years ago and had my uterus removed.  I know that's not related to other cancers, but I can't help feeling like \"here we go again...\"  I have another week to wait to see the oncologist...
