I understand my risk of getting LE is very high with that combination. I'm an avid long-distance bicyclist and hope to get back to it after my treatment are completed. I'm thinking that riding an upright bike all day long would be just asking for trouble either in increasing the risk of developing LE or making existing LE worse. I was wondering if anyone here was a long distance cyclist and had some thoughts on the matter. I'm thinking I might switch from an upright to a recumbent tadpole trike to minimize strain on my arm and allow me to maintain it at a higher elevation. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?

Thirty years ago, I had breast augmentation with subpectorial implants.  I went from an A cup to a C cup.  The old implants have both apparently ruptured somewhere along the way according to the MRI they did at the time of my diagnosis.  The old implants need to come out and will be removed by a plastic surgeon at the time of my LX and ALND. This issue is whether I want to have new implants put in at the same time.  I intitally told the plastic surgeon to put them in; now, I'm not sure what I want to do. He told me if I want to have replacement implants, I should do it at the same time the old ones are taken out.  He said that getting radiation would make it much more difficult to  stretch  that side afterward.   He also warned me that radiation can cause capsular contraction problems on that side  which may result in the need of removing the implant.   I'm really on the fence about whether I want new implants put back in.  I do like the size of my breasts right now, but I'm not sure it's worth dealing with the possible complications of new implants. I know I can't be the first person that has had to address this decision, but I haven't been able to find anywhere that talks about this particular surgical combination (lumpectomy and removal/replacement of old subpectorial implants).   Anyone else out there that has done this?  I'd love to hear from you and your experience.   Thanks!
