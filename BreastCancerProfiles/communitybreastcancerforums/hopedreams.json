U didnt say what type or stage of breast cancer that U have... would like to know.. since I did have a mastectomy 6 yrs ago..and I wasnt asked to do any chemo.. & rads were OUT since I have a ongoing skin cancer as well..But now I am waiting for biopsy on my good breast ?? I am hoping NOT cancer again..having biopsy next week.. but I will never accept doing chemo..because of the crohns disease.. my advice it only have surgery for crohns if absoluetly necessary.. good luck to U.. ~Hope",

The primary care dr or your breast surgeon would refer U to one,,,,,, IN FACT ALL OF YOUR DR.S AT MSK..ALL CONFER WITH EACH OTHER..VERY CLOSELY.. AND DECIDE ON YOUR TREATMENT.... Changing hospitals will be complicated for U to do..with your issues that U recently had.. but U sure can try.. but I truly think U would be making a mistake..U didnt even give the chemo a try..???? WHY ARE U PROCRASTINATING ON THAT.... If I understand what U are saying........U Haven't started as of yet. ***** thanks moderators for your input on MSK.. I am also a patient there for many yrs.. All of my Dr.s are there now.. I had 3 diff cancers..incl breast.. none related to another.. byee for now ~ Hope",
