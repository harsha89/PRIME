They numbed my breast first and that was a slight stick and burn and from then on I felt nothing. I also was put under heavy sedation not general anesthesia.. don't remember a thing! Good luck and best wishes!! KendraAnn",

I don't know if they are lymph nodes or the milk ducts are irritated??? They put a guide wire in so I am sure they took the right lump...right?? I asked the nurse who followed up with a phone call, but she just asked if I had a fever and that was all she offered. Anyone have an idea about this? Thanks:-)",

Thanks! The 1cm x 1 cm is the one that was biopsied. US: There is a 1 cm x 1 cm x 0.3 cm oval mass with a lobulated margin in This is the mammogram report : The tissue of the left breast is heterogeneously dense. This may lower the sensitivity of mammography. The overall pattern and distribution of the glandular tissue is unchanged from the prior exam. There is a 9 mm oval mass with a circumscribed margin in the left breast at 7 o'clock anterior depth. This was present on the prior study and is unchanged. There also is a 1.2 cm oval focal asymmetry with fine calcifications in the left axillary tail. This likely was present on the prior study but is better seen on the current exam.",

      "Content": "KendraAnn wrote: Hello, I had a routine mamo a month ago and they found a mass that looked suspicious so they did a ultrasound. Tech, Radiologist and Dr. couldnt decide what it was. They suggested a core biopsy which was performed and came back intraductal papilloma. GREAT!! They sent me to the Breast Surgeon to follow up because I also had 2 other spots in the same breast, but they were 3mm and 9mm, so they weren't concerned about those. So my question is....the surgeon reviewed my ultrasound and mamo and said that the \"mass\" does not look like an intraductal papilloma and she's concerned they didnt get the right tissue. She stated its larger than she would like (1.2 cm), it is peripheral, and it has something attached to it on one end that looks \"jagged\". So I'm just wondering what it means when the surgeon doesn't agree with the biopsy? My last mamo was 7 mo ago and these spots were not there, but they did note I have very dense breasts. My surgery is Friday and I'm trying to stay positive, but honetslyI'm a little scared. This is my 2nd scare, I had a lump 8 months ago that luckily was benign:-) Thanks for reading!

I just went to see my BS for my follow up after excisional biopsy. The good news is path report was papilloma with florid hyperplasia, so benign. Here is the part that I am wondering how and if this could happen..... The lump that the Breast doctor and I felt is not gone. Two days after surgery I felt to make sure it was gone and it wasn't. I thought there must have been an explanation, stroma, lymph node, something. But today when I saw the BS I asked her if she removed the whole lump and she said yes and asked why. I told her I still felt what was the original lump. She felt it and looked at me and said that that's not where the guide wire was put in nor was it where she took the lump from. She said it could be a lymph node that is swollen from the procedure but it could be the lump. She was very kind and did not at all dismiss the fact that this could have been a mistake. She advised I come back to her in 3 months to see if it is a swollen lymph node, if not she'll have to go back in. Three months feels like an eternity. I just can't believe this is even a possibility. Log in to post a reply",

I wondered why they needed the guide wire when the lump was VERY palpable by myself and the breast doctor, but I guess I should have asked that question. I've had the lump for 7 months so I know exactly where it was, same spot it is now and it feels the same. When she pointed today to where she took from it was lower and into the breast more. I'll just have to wait. I'm just feeling overwhelmed and needed to talk about it. Thanks for being here for me!",
