I was wondering how you like your implants and how much better they are than the expanders?  I can't wait to get these things out of me!  Unfortunately, I have to wait to finish chemo first.  Hopefully I will be done by the end of February and schedule the implant surgery.  Thanks for the info!  Re:  drains - my PS told me no showers at all either with those things.  No idea why some can and some can't weird.  Couldn't wait to get those things removed either!",

So I guess the next thing is hair loss.  Probably going to shave my head or at least buzz it short this weekend or sooner if need be.  Dreading that!!  Have a wig and bought a few Abbey caps.  Hope to not lose all my eyebrows and lashes.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  Good luck and Hugs to everyone!!!",

Thanks to all those who've already started to let us know how it's going so far. Good to know what to expect. Got a human hair wig yesterday. It's ok but not loving it. Not sure how much I'll even wear it. Might just stick with scarves and hats mostly.  My port is never accessed except for chemo. They do blood draws from my arm and the MUGA scan was also done with my arm.  Carpevinum - Welcome and sorry you have to be here. My cancer was node negative too and I've never had any scans either. Think I'm going to have to insist on it.  ",

Any insights anyone who's been through this before can give me, I'd appreciate it!  I'm glad I found a group going through the same thing I'm going through.  I wish you all luck in your treatment and good health through this New Year and beyond.  Hugs...",

They are so uncomfortable.  Can't WAIT to get them out! lol  Good luck to you.  I'll be thinking of you next week!  I'll let you know how I make out.",
