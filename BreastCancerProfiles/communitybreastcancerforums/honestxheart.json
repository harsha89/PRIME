I was worried, naturally, since my grandmother had breast cancer three times. I went to doctor and got a mammogram and the doctors were worried so they did a biopsy and that came back benign, however, they said it was fiber something but it is not a name I have been able to research. Once they gave me the news, I went and had surgery in March of 2010 and the surgeon said he could not remove all of it but did not give a reason. So, I left it alone and was happy that it was much smaller than before, however, now, it has pretty much doubled if not tripled in size since then. I do not have health insurance, so I cannot go to a doctor to get it check out. It is very firm, cannot move it, and sometimes it a bit painful. It is pretty much a growth of something stuck to me, that I know should not be there. The doctors told me it was nothing to worry about, but I am worried. I do not know if it is cancer or not, I have no other signs of anything, only the lump. It is about maybe 4 inches in length, about an inch and a half to 2 inches in width and the depth is pretty far, it is stuck to me and cannot be moved.  Any advice or anything would be helpful, even if it is just support.
