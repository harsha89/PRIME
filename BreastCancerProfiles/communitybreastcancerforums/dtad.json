A few weeks or even a few months should not make any difference in your over all outcome. Are your breasts dense? Have you had a pre op breast MRI? You want to know the whole picture before you make your decision and if you have dense breasts MRI is the best tool. Also if you have dense breasts the whole screening process afterwards is more difficult. I agree that if you decide on a lumpectomy you should definitely look into intra operative radiation. Get a second opinion if you feel you need one. You have time! Good luck.",

Fortunately the second gave us my beautiful 2 year old twin grandsons. However she was exposed to so many hormones and now I was diagnosed. The docs are unconcerned and tell her she doesn't need a baseline mammo until 40. I disagree! There is no scientific evidence to support the connection but I happen to know 3 women who got bc after infertility treatments. I'm pushing for my daughter to have her baseline at 35. Good luck.....",

To answer the original question I'll give you my reasons that I decided to have BMX. The most important reason was that I had both IDC and ILC in the left breast. My other breast had some abnormal cells in it. However the ILC did not show up on the 3D mammo or u/s, only on a preoperative MRI. So if I didn't have the IDC I never would have known I had the ILC. So difficulty in screening was a huge consideration. The other thing that convinced me is that I wanted symmetry. Also I knew I was going to refuse anti hormone therapy so I wanted to most aggressive surgery. I had direct to implant reconstruction and I have never been sorry I made these decisions. Good luck to all navigating this complicated disease.",

As you can see by my stats I was diagnosed with stage 1 about a year ago. I chose to have a bilateral mastectomy for a variety of reasons. The most important being that Im difficult to screen. I think I did as well as expected with the BMX. It was not a piece of cake but doable. My oncotype came back 27. I should add that I have a debilitating autoimmune disease which drastically affects my QOL. My MO was fine with me not doing chemo but she obviously wanted me to take an anti hormone. So far I have refused it. I came off HRT at the time of diagnosis and have been dealing with night sweats and hot flashes since. For now the anti hormones don't make sense to me. I have chosen to lower my estrogen levels naturally with supplements, exercise and weight loss. I was about 20 pounds overweight at diagnosis and have since lost 25 pounds. Im confused with conventional medicine saying that weight loss and exercise are so important in reducing recurrence and then proceed to prescribe medication which make both very difficult. This is a very personal decision and Im no way advocating it for anyone except myself. I just wanted to give you another opinion. Good luck to you and please keep us posted.....",

I'm a little confused as to why she is having mammograms if she had a BMX. However it sounds like she has a really good chance of being ok.

I agree you need a breast MRI. You really can't be staged until after surgery. However I have been reading that staging is becoming less and less important. The word cured is seldom used in breast cancer. Unfortunately its something we have to stay on top of for the rest of our lives. Do you know what your hormone receptors are? How big was the ILC tumor? All these things must be considered when looking at recurrence rates. My advice is to decide where you want to be treated, wait until you have all the information needed to make a well informed decision about treatment options. We are all here for you. Breast cancer is very complicated and there is a learning curve. Please feel free to private message me if you want to talk more. Good luck and keep us posted.",

The theory behind not doing any scans or MRIs is that by the time something shows up on them, you will be symptomatic and thus stage 4. Really? Can't we do better than that? Yes there is bloodwork to check tumor markers. However they are not done for stage 1 because they are thought to be invalid. Some docs do use them for more advanced stages. Salamandra...the reason you have imaging done is because you still have your breasts. MRIs and mammograms are done to check for a recurrence in them.

I'm in the medical profession and I can honestly tell you that small community hospitals are just not well equipped to treat serious illness. Of course that does not mean that everyone being treated at a community hospital will do poorly. However there is a reason why the top docs in the country are found at university based facilities. IMO at the very least get a second opinion at one. I also do not agree that every facility have the same protocols. Also unfortunately just liking your doc is not enough. Do your research. Find out where they went to school and did their training. Good luck to all navigating this complicated disease. Happy New Year",

Also for better symmetry. One more reason is for many reasons I knew I would refuse chemo and anti hormone therapy so I wanted the most aggressive surgery. Im happy with my decision.

It is the best screening tool for dense breasts. You didn't mention what your receptor status is. Are you estrogen/progesterone and Her2 positive? This will further determine treatment. There is also a test called the Oncotype which helps to decide if you need chemo or not. How big was your tumor?

The biopsy should be able to define it. Im not seeing that a malignancy was picked up in the information you provided. Only an enlargement. This can't be the full report right?",

I was scheduled to have a lumpectomy prior to those results. The original tumor was a 1cc IDC and the second was a 1cc ILC. I would have never known about the ILC if the IDC did not show up on the mammo. So I elected to have a BMX due to difficult screening. When I asked my doc if it was uncommon to have 2 tumors in same breast with different characteristics and he said no. Good luck and keep us posted....",

I would be more concerned about the physician's educational background and the facility at which they practice. I do believe that breast surgeons are a better choice than general surgeons. I also believe that being treated at a major university teaching hospital is paramount. We all have to make our own informed treatment options. Good luck to everyone navigating this complicated disease!",

My QOL was very poor when I was diagnosed. Its really hard not to feel sorry for yourself and feel enough is enough! Why do some people seem to sail through life and others suffer. To start remember they have to prove you have BC before you do. The waiting is horrendous. I'm so sorry you are alone too. Just not fair! I'm happy you found us and we are all here for you.
