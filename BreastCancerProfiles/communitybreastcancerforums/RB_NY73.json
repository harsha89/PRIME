I would be ever so grateful to be part of this group as I am having surgery on November 13th... same day as evily. I am 45 and a wife and mother of two (20&17). So glad to have found this thread for information, encouragement and support! Even though I was very recently diagnosed; and with much dilemma and consideration of all the pros and cons for myself personally... I have decided to go with a lumpectomy with radiation. Mainly based on my recurrence percentage wise rate being the same with either procedure. I was fortunate to be able to get this surgery date before my family leaves for vacation on the day after Thanksgiving to NOLA (we've had it planned since the beginning of the summer). Hopefully, I will be fully recovered by then??? I've read it takes a week and a half to two weeks for full recovery if all goes well with no complications. Fingers crossed. What's next if I'm cleared for surgery by my primary? So, just spent the day today with my primary for surgical pre-ops... answering questions, doing blood tests and having an EKG. Tomorrow they are placing in my SAVI SCOUT reflector localization device (in lieu of wire localization the day of). I'm told it's the size of a grain of rice and the procedure itself is similar to doing a biopsy. Yesterday, I did a breast MRI that took longer than expected (results came back fine), so it's been a crazy couple of days. Lots happening in a short amount of time. I'm hoping I'll have time to take a breath before surgery date as I have been (prior to being diagnosed) coordinating the food and table centerpieces for our Stewardship Campaign Lucheon for 125 members of our church. It will be held on the Sunday the 18th, but I am trying to get most of the hard work done prior to surgery and at the very least be well enough to direct the set up on the day of... as I've heard you're good to resume normal activities by day 3 or 4 after surgery. Wishing everyone all the best for smooth surgeries and an even smoother recoveries!!! â™¥ ",
