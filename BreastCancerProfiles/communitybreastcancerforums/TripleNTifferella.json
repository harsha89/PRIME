In the past 2-3 weeks I've noticed pain on the side where I had surgery if I physically touch a specific spot or lay on that side. I don't feel scar tissue there that I do know. I had a pet scan right after surgery and there was a small 'node' on the scan. The MOC said he wasn't concerned because I was starting chemo. Well... I went 12 weeks on Taxol and my original tumor doubled in size in a month which in turn sent me to the surgeon for the BMX. I had been telling him that i was having pain and felt like my tumor was getting bigger. he kept saying it was scar tissue. Well, no. :) so, I don't necessarily just sit by and take it now. My question, after my long winded post lol :) Have any of you experienced pain months after a mastectomy? If so, what was it? I appreciate any comments, thank you!
