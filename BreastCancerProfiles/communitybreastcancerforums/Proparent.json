When I was diagnosed in July 2016 with a couple of bone mets to the rib and spine, I had a TM (CA 15-3) drawn in August. It was 174. One month later after starting Ibrance 125mg it went up to 202. A month after that and being switched to Ibrance 100mg because of low white and platelet counts, it went up to 327! Now I'm on Ibrance 75mg (again due to continuing problems with low counts) I'm very worried about the next time they draw the TM.",

Turns out I have extensive bone met progression now on the skull (3 areas) all up and down my spine, several different ribs, my upper arm bone, femur just above the knee, pelvic bones and hip socket! So they stopped the Ibrance/Faslodex combo and I am now on Xeloda. I'll have a blood draw in the next couple of weeks to check everything and a scan when done with my 2nd cycle of Xeloda.",

I don't have too many areas of pain, just a couple spots in the ribs that hurt like heck. but the meds they prescribed me seem to do the trick. I hope the Xeloda goes easy on me! I only just started my first cycle on Dec. 26th. Time will tell I guess.",
