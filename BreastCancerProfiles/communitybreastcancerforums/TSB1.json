I'm going to continue with the latisse and see what happens. For me, losing my eyebrows and lashes was much harder than losing my hair. It really gave me a serious case of \"cancer face\".",

I'm taking claritin and so far so good. Today I'm really tired and just feel out of sorts. After doing some research I asked about slowing down the C infusion next time to see if I can avoid the headache. One down and that makes me happy. Also, I will be giving myself the neulasta from now on. I plan to inject in one of the numb areas in my abdomen. I've got some numb spots from my DIEP flap surgery so that should work out fine I think. Good luck to everyone and I hope the S/E are minimal for everyone. Have a great weekend. Theresa",

On my first visit to my BS he did the BRCA test and told me we would wait for the results before scheduling the surgery. During this time I went to the Hem/Onc doc and had tons of tests done that my plastic surgeon ordered. I already knew I was having a mastectomy and not lumpectomy and I also knew I would be having immediate reconstruction with a DIEP flap. The BRCA results came back in a couple of weeks and were negative. However, I decided to have BMx since my BS felt my chance of BC in opposite side was about 25% and since the DIEP flap is a one time deal. I am so glad I made the decision to do this as it was absolutely the right decision for me. Since I had BMx I no longer have to have mammograms but I will be checked by my BS every 6 months for several years. The reason for this is that all the breast tissue was scooped out and also they got clear margins. The BS explained that if it were to come back in the breast area, it would be in the skin and would be palpable on exam. He also said it most likely would be in the upper, outer quadrant because that's most often where it returns.",

I have said for years that my heroes are the children and adolescents who have cancer and go through their journey with dignity and courage. I have never seen such strength before. When I was diagnosed, I told myself and my loved ones that I would only surround myself with positive thoughts and energy and lots of humor. I draw my strength from my patients over the years. They have taught me so much and I feel blessed to have had a small part in their care. I also have a wonderful role model in my mom. She is a 23 year BC survivor and 10 year colon cancer survivor. She's the best! I honestly have not felt down or in the dumps and sometimes I question if something is wrong with that. I have been shown nothing but love and support from my husband, family, friends and coworkers. I truly feel blessed. It makes me very sad to read stories of those who don't have the same support. My wish is for everyone to have the same unwavering support and love. Every night I pray for all the women on the BCO board. I have learned so much from everyone here and I want to thank y'all for that. I hope this post doesn't come across as boastful. That is not my intent. I have just been feeling these emotions and thoughts for six months now and I wanted to share them. I have already told my loved ones how I feel but I don't think I can ever tell them enough. I've had six months now to think about what cancer has taught me and I would love to hear your thoughts as well. I hope that everyone will be sharing some of these things. That is, if everyone is ok with me hijacking this thread for a little while. I'll start. One thing I have learned is nothing beats the love and support of your family and friends. I will add more later. I hope everyone has a wonderful SE free day! Theresa",

I start swishing a mixture of baking soda with a very small amount of salt mixed with a cup of water on treatment day one and I do this 2-3 times a day for about 10 days. It really keeps the thrush away. After you get this cleared up, try this for future treatments. I swear by it. Good luck! Theresa.",

I'm not sure how many people still follow this thread but I'm hoping there are still some of us out there. I went back to work last week on a part time basis. I had a welcome back sign on my locker and a welcome back banner that my co workers signed. I got so many hugs from everyone, I'm surprised I wasn't sore. I worked just a couple of hours Tuesday and was beat. I worked five hours Wednesday and did much better! I had my first of twelve taxols last Thursday and I felt good the next day so I worked. The worst part of the taxol is the floaty feeling I get from the Benadryl. I hate feeling that way. Also I vomited before anything was infused because I could taste and smell the saline and the heparin. From now on, I will sip on some juice when she pushes things. The taxol caught up with me on Saturday night when I got the achy bones and felt fluish. Also, I have had stomach cramps for days now. Today seems to be better. I definitely do not have much of an appetite either. Tomorrow it's back to work and Thursday will be taxol #2. Have a good day ladies.",

I'm 4 months PFC and I feel \"almost normal\". I started arimidex in January and so far, so good. I'm taking glucosamine to help with joint pain. The only other issues I have with arimidex are sleep problems and the dreaded vaginal dryness. Really I can't complain because it's a good weapon to have in my arsenal. I'm still taking all my supplements for neuropathy since I have some minor issues with my toes on my left foot. My nails are still messed up but they're getting better and growing out. I hope everyone is doing well.",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2012 09:51PM - edited Aug 12, 2012 09:56PM by TSB1 Hi everyone! One year ago yesterday was my first chemo treatment. What a difference a year makes. I feel almost completely normal. I'm back to working full time and I'm not as tired anymore. I've already had a haircut in June and could use another one soon. I've got some aches and pains from the arimidex and cataracts, most likely from the steroids and chemo. I'm getting a scan Friday to check some lung nodules they found last September. We've been doing CT's every 6 months just to keep an eye on them. Since I've had some hip pain for a while he threw in a PET scan too. It's probably just arthritis but he wanted to check and since I was due next month for the CT he wanted to play it safe. I hope everyone is feeling well and \"normal\" again. How's the tamoxifen or arimidex going? Anyone else develop cataracts? MizMarie, so sorry to hear about the colon cancer. That's completely unfair! Did you have to do more chemo for that?",
