I just had a liver mri yesterday because they saw an 8 mm lesson on my liver in a breast Mri I had done last year. And due to freaking out about chemo n rads last year I'm just now following up on the liver . I'm constantly freaking out about lymph node lumps... I feel like I found one in my groin not sure if I'm just being a nervous nelly or not but the area is sore(slightly painful and achy) and so is my armpit area. I'm getting a second mammo on Tuesday because I'm freaking about that too. Holy cow I'm constantly anxious about it coming back",
