It was a long day, though.  Got there at 9:00 and left about 1:15.  Although there was a lady who said here's takes all day.  Now that I'm home, my head feels a little heavy.  The chemo nurse said I should start nausea meds tonight and then alternate them for the next couple of days instead of waiting for symptoms.  Glad she told me that as I would not of used them if I didn't have systems. I notice we have a very similar diagnosis.  My tumor was 4 cm which makes me Stage 2B, Grade 3 and of course being HER2+ makes the cancer agressive.  Lindy",

The Herceptin will continue for a total of one year.  I am ER, PR and HER2 positive.  I\"m not sure what lies ahead for me as far as SE, but it is comforting to know there is a group online to chat with.  Does anyone have similar treatments that I'm going to receive?  I'm open to any suggestions for handling SE.  Thanks!",
