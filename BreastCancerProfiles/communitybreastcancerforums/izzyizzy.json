I started Rads on 2/22 and will get to the halfway point tomorrow.   I am wondering if anyone else is experiencing joint pain or flareups of old injuries.  I have always been very active and have had some knee and shoulder sprains in the past.  Over the last week or so I have noticed significant pain in both my knee and in my shoulder/neck area.  Went to see a Chiropractor today because the neck was a 9 out of 10 on the pain scale.  After xrays, he treated me with ultrasound and physical adjustment but he suspects the radiation may be causing tissue and nerve flareups. Anyone else have this problem?",
