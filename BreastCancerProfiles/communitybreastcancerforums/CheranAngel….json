Been getting them since i was 23, im now 54. mine also said linear calcification. What stage r you? they told me DCIS is the best scenario especially if non invasive. I found all the woman doctors and techs to be so comforting. . I was more terrified than I needed to be about procedures. Stereotactic biopsy after a 1/2 Xanax was a piece of cake as was my lumpectomy. I had DCIS stage 0 grade 2-3. After surgery all Margins clear to 5 mm . Do yourself a favor and do not compare yourself to anyone on this board. I found out if there are 50 cases they are all different. YOurs sounds very close to mine. Wait for your surgeon appt. they will explain everything. NO one is a bigger weeny than me when it comes to drs and hospitals and I was fine...I over worried. I've been blessed with my diagnosis. Never thought I'd say that. Tested negative for the BRCA gene too. I pray yours is good news too. :)",
