He said I'd be able to lift after the weekend and my trip in 8 days would be no problem. I'm only concern is the nurse gave my after care instructions verbally and I can't really remember them all? She said leave the bandage in place for 48hrs then you can shower. Today marks 48hrs so I took off my bandage to see 4-5 steri strips neatly placed on and half of them soaked in dry brown blood. I called my surgeons office to make sure that I don't remove them and she confirmed. She said its my choice if I want to cover the wound after my shower again? Honestly I worried about bleeding but the hospital never gave me any other bandages? It's not a problem to pick them up I just wish the nurse explained to me more on how long I should keep covering the wound up. I managed not to get the steri strips wet, just a couple drops and I am leaving them in place. How long was it before anyone steri strips fall off? I'm assuming you just let them fall off? I also have dissolveable stitches, how long did it take for them to dissolve for anyone? I should clean off then brown dry blood right? Just leave it be? Log in to post a reply",
