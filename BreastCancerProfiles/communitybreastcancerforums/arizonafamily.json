She was on chemo on and off ever since. But as of 3 weeks ago, she started experiencing pain around her gallbladder/side area. She went to the hospital and an exam revealed she had excess spinal fluid around her brain. After that, a spinal tap was done and that showed breast cancer cells in her cerebrospinal fluid. Her two oncologists looked it over and put her on full brain radiation starting the next week. She is doing two-a-day treatments every week day. About a week in to that (around a week ago), she started experiencing excruciating pain from her head, down to her neck and spine. So we've been on ice, epsom salt baths, and pain meds (as of yesterday morning, morphine) to give her relief. So from the pain meds to the radiation, she has gotten very weak the past few days and bedridden almost 24 hours a day. I've seen many of your posts so I'm pretty positive it's Leptomeningeal Metastases. But I just want to know why this spinal pain is occurring. Is it a build-up of CSF in her dura on the brain that's causing pressure on her spinal cord? Or possibly a tumor in her spine that's pressing on an organ or nerve? I'd REALLY appreciate your feedback! Thanks for your time and I hope all of you are doing well Log in to post a reply",
