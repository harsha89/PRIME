I'm somewhat terrified about my own genetics/risk/history. I'm only 32 but had a fiberabnoma removed when I was 20, a MRSA abscess while breastfeeding, and a cyst all in my right side. Doctors have said these are all unrelated, but I feel like it's more like foreshadowing that my breasts (or at least rightie) are trouble makers. Where do I start with early screenings and testing? My gyno? My mother's gene testing isn't back yet. Log in to post a reply",

I\u2019ll make an appointment to see my obgyn and then go from there to start getting early mammograms and screenings. My mom's insurance which is the same as mine denied her BRACA test even though she has cancer and family history, but she still did it so I should know her results soon. Since I have the same insurance (my dad and husband work for the same company) I may choose to do the color.com test for myself instead so I\u2019m not stuck with a $4000 bill. ",

My mom has family history and recent diagnosis of breast cancer and they\u2019re not paying for it... ridiculous. We have the same insurance so I\u2019m guessing it would be similar for me especially since I don\u2019t have a dx. Oh well, her pricey test results will be coming in soon and I may have a clearer picture at that time.",
