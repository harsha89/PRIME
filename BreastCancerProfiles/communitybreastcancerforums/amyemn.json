I find a lot of people who have not had to deal with a friend or family member having cancer just do not know how to help and may be counting on you to ask for it.",

He hasn't once asked me how I am feeling and when our daughter threw a tantrum last night and I asked him if he could take that, he looked at me like I was crazy. I ended up managing the situation by myself all while I had a headache. He never left the couch except to listen in and try to find some fault with my parenting. So, so far chemo has been aces compared to the support from my husband.",

Only catch is I have to find one through a medical retailer, which after some searching, doesn't seem to be correct. The ones listed one my insurance website seems to be for hearing aids and stuff. Has anyone else here gotten a wig through insurance? Specifically BCBS?",
