I had a full hysterectomy at 30 and have been hormone replacement since. My gyn sent me to a breast specialist who did an ultrasound that showed nothing. She sent me for a mammogram that also showed nothing. There is definitely something there and I'm worried. There is no history of breast cancer in my family. Anyone else experienced this?
