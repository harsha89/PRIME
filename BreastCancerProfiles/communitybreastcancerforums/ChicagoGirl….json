I'm to the point where I just feel like passing out index cards with my medical history on them and getting the rejection part over with. In the beginning when meeting guys I found myself to be very blunt which I think scared them off but I looked at it as let's just get this out the way therefore no one's time is wasted. Now I've learned to discuss things when I feel comfortable, it's not about them but more so about me, I've learned to let an individual get to know me first verses the girl diagnosed with cancer.. I'm still finding this is not to be easy to tell new people and I guess it never will, I think I've taught myself to become numb to rejection and allowing myself to catch feelings for an individual but I don't want to be alone in this. I've been recently dating a guy for 3 months now and he's a really nice guy. I told him my situation about a week or so ago and now I feel like I'm waiting on the other shoe to drop, his reaction was normal and he shared with my his mom passed of breast cancer and his sister recently finished treatment. I'm just hoping nothing will change, for now we're just dating and taking things slow which is fine but I've been here before and it seems some people do not know how to be upfront with their true feelings.. thank you ladies for being here and sharing you stories and thoughts..

My regimen is every three weeks for the TDM1 and every 6wks for the Xgeva shot. However as we all know it has been said with Stage 4 you will possibly have to continue on chemo throughout our life..

However after almost a year of stable scans (nothing seen in the chest wall, the lesions of the liver are looking like scar tissue and remain stable and the same for the spine) they are okay with it. Funny because now that I have received the okay I've been wondering is it worth it. After meeting with the plastic surgeon and being told they would use the muscle from my back plus as well as an implant it sounds like a lot.
