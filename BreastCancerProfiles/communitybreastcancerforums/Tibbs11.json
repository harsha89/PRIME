Your story will be one of courage, strength and victory. A positive attitude can make things easier, but a deep conviction, the absolute belief that you will beat this thing, well, that's gold. It's a difficult journey, but you will get to the end of it, and one day realize that you haven't thought about cancer once all day. Give yourself all the love you can. Hug yourself, be kind to yourself, forgive yourself. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.",

I just had my SAVI device implanted on Thursday, and I start the rads on Monday, 2x a day, 5 days. My lumpectomy was Feb 26, but for several reasons, the radiation is just happening now, which everyone assures me is just fine. So far no issues with the device inside me, I can't feel it at all, and I'm feeling good generally, lots of energy. No swelling, no pain, no issues. Did the scan&plan session yesterday. Looking forward to having it all behind me!",
