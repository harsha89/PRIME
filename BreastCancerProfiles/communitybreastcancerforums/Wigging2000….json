My heart breaks when I think about having to tell them...their lives will change too. Everyone says that this part is extremely tough and once we have a plan we will feel better. I hope they are right! I was on antidepressants before my dx and also take something at night for anxiety, haven\u2019t had to increase anything yet because the meds do a good job. Definitely ask for something if you\u2019re awake at night...sleep is the one respite you get right now from the all consuming thoughts. Good luck with your appointment on Tuesday.

Last week I was called back on an annual screening mammo on the left side, had diagnostic mammo with u/s on Monday and biopsy on breast and lymph nodes yesterday. Today, I got the call around 4pm. I am incredibly thankful that things have moved so quickly so far. All I know so far is that the lymph nodes they biopsied were clear, that I have some type of invasive carcinoma in the breast, and that they want to do further testing on lymph nodes. I have an appointment tomorrow at the cancer center.

The biopsy clip is only to mark the spot so they will know that is the area that has been studied when you have your future mammograms. It does not mean that they think it is cancer. I had a biopsy for microcalcifications come back benign. They were \u201cnew\u201d so hadn\u2019t changed or grown but the doctor didn\u2019t like the way they presented. As I said they ended up being benign. At the mammogram one year later there was no concern at all in that area. Most biopsies do come back benign. Hoping that yours will too! Hopefully you\u2019ll get results quickly and be able to move on from this. I know that it is very scary to wait for tests and test results. Just remember that the odds are in your favor! Hugs!  ",

I know you will rock chemo...but sorry that you have to do it. To all waiting for results and recovering...hugs to you as well. It doesn\u2019t seem fair that we \u201crecover\u201d and then go straight to oncology, but I guess it\u2019s all kind of part of it. I\u2019m not sure if I will get any test results at my oncology appointment on Monday or not. My original tumor (IDC)was grade 2 to 3...they also found surprise DCIS and LCIS in addition to ILC so not sure how any of this adds up. From my pathology report my stage appears to be 1a. I\u2019m trying to stay peaceful as I wait...for results and to get these dreadful drains out.  ",

I hope yours come out at just the right time for you. It seems that so many things (showering, drains, etc) are so dependent on the individual doctors\u2019 preferences. Cjzach-the lymph node thing certainly sounds frustrating and confusing! I\u2019m sorry you are dealing with that. I\u2019m glad the healing is resolving. Hopefully you do not have to wait too long to see your oncologist. Oh the continual train of waiting!!!! So much patience is required! ",

No additional cancer surgery or radiation needed. My right breast was clear and my left breast has LCIS and DCIS in addition to the IDC that we already knew about...largest tumor size 1.7 cm. So, onward I go. Will not know about chemo until after they run the new tumor markers on the DCIS/LCIS. More waiting, but I'll be healing from Fake Boob Friday while I wait!

The most important thing is that the doctor gets the tissue he/she needs, and if you\u2019re anxious and fighting emotions that may make being still and calm harder. If you feel you need meds, ask for them. You might need a driver with you and might need to sign consent for the procedure prior to taking the meds (this was my experience).
