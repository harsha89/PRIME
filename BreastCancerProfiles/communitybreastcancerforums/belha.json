Since I was allowed to shower this morning, I did and made sure to wash the area well (and gently). I ended up falling back asleep for a couple hours (still having some lingering tiredness), and upon waking up again it looks so much better. The itch is gone and the skin is not red and irritated anymore. I will have to make sure to ask the surgeon on my follow up what could have caused it so I know for future refernece. Thanks!",

Where the rash ends at my neck and on my upper arm. I have an appt with the surgeon tomorrow, I had called Monday and talked to the nurse as my surgeon was in the OR. So I called back Tuesday and they told me to come in. From what I read on google, and saw pictures it looks like a reaction to Chloraprep (sp?) I'm sure I'll find out more tomorrow. I hope to get some relife, I probably should have just bit the bullet and went to urgent care or the ER over the weekend, but I really didn't want to see a Dr who wasn't my surgeon.",

I read online someone had this reaction from the draping? And that would make sense with how my rash is. Any experiences? Im not sure who to call since its Saturday.

Well now I am in the middle of getting the issue taken care of I've had to put job searching off the table, much to my dismay. I just for one, can't lose my medical insurance. (Usually you have a 60-90 wait period at new employment before benefits kick in). Would lose my paid sick time. And, to start a new job and already be like .. Well I need such & such off to get the surgery and then such & such off for follow up appointments.. I just don't think that is fair to a brand new employer.

      "Content": "belha wrote: I found a lump in my left breast about 2 months ago, I know I shouldn't have but I waited one menstral cycle to see if it might go away or shrink (thinking it could be a cyst). Well it didn't so I made an appt with my gyno and she felt the lump, and sent me for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound which I had done on 3/15. The gyno didn't seen worried about my lump. It is oval shaped, very moveable, smooth, and just a little firm. I have no idea how long it has been there, never noticed it before. Recently lost about 20lbs (on purpose, they did a Weight Watchers group at my work) and I did have definate weight loss in my breasts. The lump was noticeable on my mammo, it does have smooth edges all around very clear and defined. They saw it on the ultrasound as well. The radiologist said to me it appears to be a fibroadenoma, but they wanted to send me for an ultrasound needle biopsy to be certain. I went and had that done this afternoon. The radiologist who performed it told me that my lump does have a lot of benign characteristics, but doing this biopsy is pretty much standard procedure just so everyone knows 100% what it is. Now the wait is on until Monday, Tuesday at the latest. It's hard not to think about the what ifs. I am 32 years old, and my husband and I were planning on trying for our first child later this year. I am currently not on any hormonal birth control, but was for a long time before getting married. I was almost in tears in the waiting room today waiting to go in for my procedure. It didn't help they were running almost an hour behind so I had time for all the bad thoughts to run through my mind. I actually had a lump removed from my right breast in 2008. That lump was not moveable, and very hard. Turned out to be scar tissue. That was handled completely different than this one. They did the mammo/ultrasound and then refered me to a surgeon. We monitored the lump for about 4 months, and it didn't change. We decided to remove it under local, so once he got it out he was pretty much able to tell me with 98% certainy he felt it was scar tissue and thats what it turned out to be. Log in to post a reply",

It leaves me time for my mind to wonder. Have been just sticking to my daily life routine, and that is keeping me busy until I am laying in bed at night.

It's an outpaitent procedure, and honestly recovery isn't that bad. I had a lumpectomy in 2009 and it was verrrry easy, done only under local. (Again close to the surface).

My gyn and even the radiologist who did my US and mammo all told me they were 99% sure it was a fibroadenoma but wanted to do a biopsy because of the size (mine was over 2 cm). If you are getting a core needle done it sounds like the mass is solid and not a cyst. The core needle is very easy, they numb you up very well and I didn't feel a thing. My Dr who did this was very nice, he also said he was pretty sure it was a fibroadenoma. Long story short, my path came back as something rare so they sent it away for a 2nd opinion and I had the lump removed on Friday. Final path is a fibroadenoma. My lump was oval and moveable as well. It's very nerve wracking, but like Melissa said the odds are really in your favor. Fibroadenomas are pretty common from what I gather.",
