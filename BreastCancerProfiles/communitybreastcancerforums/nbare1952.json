There have been so many brave women on this site who have lost their fight and so many others who continue fighting with such strength and courage.  Earthquakes take thousands of lives.  Countries still fight and kill each other.  People still lie, hurt and kill each other.  Today I found out that the daughter of friend has juvenile diabetes.  She is two years old.  I wish I could pray, really pray for her and others.

My oncologist had not heard of it but it turns out a radiation oncologist who also practices alternative medicine was familiar with it. They put a device in your ear. The device needs to be replaced every four days. It works best if you are not on a chemo that causes neuropathy. They had a patient who had not driven in years and she was driving after twelve treatments. I tried it with some success while on Havalen which causes neuropathy. I am going to try it again now that I am on a/a. On the downside you have to go back every four days and cannot get it wet. It was not really painful although you may hear a buzzing noise.

Nothing of concern showed up except this same area of the hip.  This time the radiologist recommended a MRI.  The MRI was inconclusive.  My oncologist suggested we wait a few months and do another pet/cat scan.  Again in February the area showedup and this time it was a little more inflamed. I then had a bone biopsy.  Microscopic cancer cells were present.  I finished twenty five radiation treatments in April and have been on monthly Zometa since the end of February.  My oncologist is very hopeful that the radiation zapped the cancerous cells in my hip and that the Zometa will strengthen my bones.  The only time I had any pain requiring pain medication was after the biopsy.  I still have occasional discomfort in my hip and it scares me because I thought the radiation would relieve any pain I had.  I will have scans in August. I would not worry too much if you are a Stage I although I would certainly mention any new pain or concerns to my doctor.   It is always better to be safe than sorry. We will always worry.  That is our new normal.  I guess the key is not letting fear dictate how we live our lives. I will pray for you. Love, Nancy",

If you would like to pm me with a wish list of German goodies and an address I know he would be happy to send a care package. Know that everyone here cares. Hugs Nancy",

I really had no pain in the hip or at least no pain that I would have questioned if I did not have breast cancer.  After the radiation I had periods of fairly bad pain for a few weeks.  From what I have read this is not unusual.  For the last few days I have had some pain again.  What has your experience been with radiation to your hip?  I know I still have some discomfort in my chest due to the radiation there.  Of course I jump every time the phone rings.  I really do not expect results today.  Maybe I will get them tomorrow or Wednesday.  One minute I want to know and the next minute I think I can be happy in la la land forever. Any and all prayers would be appreciated too.  You all are always in my thoughts and prayers. Love, Nancy Log in to post a reply",
