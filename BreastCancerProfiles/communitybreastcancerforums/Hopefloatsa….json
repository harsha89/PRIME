You know, I'm just trying to wrap my head around this. Sorry I don't fit in a tidy box. I'm typically not snarky, but I'm just too emotional to deal. My way of dealing is constantly learning and researching. I'm sorry if I was out of line.",

There are so may different experiences, but an overwhelming feeling of togetherness. It makes me feel better about facing the results when I get them. Also, after I find my new normal, I would love to share some of these stories with friends and acquaintances as I preach the benefits of getting our mammograms regularly. Now, I just have to get over seeing a picture of my mass. It looks ominous. It is not all clean and encapsulated. It looks ugly. I know this doesn't bode well for negative results.  Angela",
