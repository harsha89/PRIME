I don't really know if it affected it or not. My problems have been coming on gradually over a period of 10 years. In March I noticed a swollen area under my arm. I had 2 different docs look at it and tell me it wasn't something to worry about, and sent me for mammo and ultra sound. I told them I thought it was LE. I was just about pain free by the summer and then went crazy moving furniture and cleaning. I never took the threat of LE seriously. I quit wearing my compression sleeve years ago. Now that I look back, I know it's been coming on, because my breast hurt and upper arm. I had swelling running down the arm into the elbow, and forearm. Now I have tingling feelings in my back. I did everything wrong these past 14 years. Whatever my therapist back in 2004 said don't do, I did. I didn't know it could get like this. I'd grocery shop, and load my arms down with bags, vacuum, mop, pull weeds, walk a 70 pound dog with him yanking on the leash, and I love to paint and draw, and crochet too. The only thing I did right was wear gloves when cooking and cleaning. Back in May I got stung by a bee on my arm while outside washing windows, and got cellulitis. I have an appointment to see my doc on Monday, and ask him for a referral to a therapist. So, I don't know if the tamoxifen contributed to mine or not. I have an aunt that was told in 1982 that she had 2 years to live max. She had a radical mastectomy, and many lymph nodes removed. She is now 90 years old with Alzheimer's. Her present doctor said she was on tamoxifen for too long (13 years), and that may have contributed to the Alzheimer's. They didn't know back in the 80s that tamoxifen should only be used for 5 years. She never got LE. Other than the Alzheimer's, she is a walking miracle. Hope this helps.",

I lost half the breast on the right side, but still have have a c cup on the left, and it offered no compression across my chest or upper arm. The sleeve was huge. So I ordered the Go shirt size xxl today, and am keeping my fingers crossed it will fit. If it does indeed fit, that's a super price point at 25 dollars. I purchased 2 compression cami's from Catherines, and I love them. When wearing the compression across the chest my breast doesn't get all achy by mid day. I need some compression under the arm, so if this Go t fits I'll be thrilled! Anyone thinking of spending the plus $80. for the Wearease, beware they ran large for me.

We had about 30 minutes together, and she was almost 45 minutes late seeing me. She acted like she didn't have room for me to even have therapy that day. She said in a huff that all the rooms were full. She never laid a hand on me. Now I am asking myself did I find the right therapist or not. As I recall the first time I went to therapy in 2004 I was measured the first time, and when I went back for the second session she got started on my therapy, and we were a few sessions into therapy when she taught me how to do it myself. I need to know what to expect with the first few sessions.I have questions like how long a therapy session should generally last, how long before I see some results, I know everyone is different.

My entire left artery was stripped out during my treatments 15 years ago. It got infected, and the wound had to lay open for a couple weeks with a sponge sucking out infection. I spent a couple weeks in a hospital hooked up to that machine. The wound was very deep and my scar on that side reaches from above my wrist all the way down to my hand. They said I could have lost that arm. It took months to get over those surgeries, and it happened because I did not have a port. All of my treatments and antibiotics went into that arm, and to make matters worse I spent time in the hospital during treatments for pneumonia. It is almost impossible to get a blood pressure reading on that side. The breast cancer was on my right side, and my left arm has no main artery. Triple P: The puffiness under my arm has never gone away. I first noticed it about a year ago. It's uncomfortable at times, and now my hand is really bothering me. The warm weather is the worst for me, and this year in the southeast we are having an early spring, so the swelling is already getting worse! I have discomfort across my chest on both sides now. As far as I am concerned LE is painful. I get pangs of pain, burning, and fullness too. One year ago I had a diagnostic mamo and ultra sound to rule out a breast cancer recurrence. Sometimes I am not aware of the puffy underarm, and other times it feels fuller. Best wishes to you in getting to the bottom of the puffiness! Since I posted earlier in Feb. I have been to my gyn doc and she sent me for a diagnostic mamo and ultra sound on the left side to make sure I don't have breast cancer there. Now she wants me to see a cardiologist to rule out heart problems. I honestly don't think that it's my heart. I believe I am plagued with LE and also neuropathy. I haven't been to therapy in a while, and will probably start again soon, as the weather here is getting hot again. ",

I am in a great deal of pain on days when it's hot and muggy, so I know I can't go through the summer like this. At this point I am thinking about either going straight to a therapist, I can get a prescription from my regular doctor, or going to an internist. I am not sure what I am going to do. I inserted the photo, so you can see the trauma to the unaffected side. That was 15 years ago! That dark area is were the skin was laid open and a sponge inserted to drain infection from sepsis. Now here we are 15 years later, and this mess has come back to haunt me. ",

I felt like I could do anything I set my mind to on Thursday. On Friday a rainy weather pattern set in the southeast. They are calling it a stalled weather pattern. We've had rain for 3 days, and it looks like we will have a few more days of rain ahead. Yesterday my arm, breast, and underarm felt full, and my skin felt hard in my arm, and breast. It felt like I had burning sensations in my breast and upper arm. Is anyone else's symptoms worse when the weather is rainy. I know the heat affects it, but how does the rain affect yours?

      "Content": "Oct 7, 2015 02:45PM - edited Oct 7, 2015 02:47PM by paintThesky I don't know about long flights and cellulitis, but I developed it after a bee sting in the spring. The bee stung me on the affected arm, and at the time I didn't realize I was in a LE flare. My arm, underarm, breast, trunk areas had been bothering me, and after 14 years of surviving breast cancer, I didn't think the LE would get bad. Anyhow, since the cellulitis, my swelling has been worse in general. I did not have to go into the hospital; thankfully oral antibiotics took care of the infection, and I was better in about a weeks time. I am pretty sure the cellulitis caused me to turn the corner with LE. I wear compression all the time now, and it seems like I always will.",
