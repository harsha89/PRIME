So whatever help is available to you, take it and think I will be happy again. Today, was my wedding anniversary and it was a good day. I was happy and forgot about \"the disease\". Peace ",

It is difficult because we all rely on their expertise and knowledge; if they fall short we are the recipients of an error which can cause harm. Have you considered having a separate md who is only a hematologist for the clot? Also adding a specialist md who evaluates interactions of all your medications, both prescription and any other pills or supplements that you are taking with the chemo protocol. Another add is a cardiologist since some treatments can effect the heart. This approach breaks up a reliance on a singular md in your treatment , methodically helps in your decision making and plans. My approach is separate but coordinated care. I ocassionally discuss treatment options with a consulting mo from another facility who has access to my records. Kathy",

Ct scan will show in detail anything in the lungs and the MRI is the same for the liver. Perhaps a Inventional radiologist could offer a treatment plan such as TACE or Y90 and consider consulting with MO at a research facility for possible trials for your mom. Personally, I wouldnt rely on PET and ultrasounds for my diagnosis. You are a wonderful supporting daughter , don't give up hope ",

My original dx's was 1993 with reoccuranes in 2002 ,2005, 2012 (mastectomy) and then stage 4 in 2015. I now have mets in lung (stable) and liver (approximately stable). Currently I am on faslodex , previously ibrance. First let me say, you never get over the dx's, I was supposed cured, obviously though I wasn't free of cancer cells. However, you learn to live as well as you can, I am fully active and travel fairly often. Last Thursday, I left my MO's office almost giddy with joy that I did not have to go to chemo and could continue on the hormonals. I know the day will come when I will have to go to chemo but \" it's not today\". Your resources are critical for you to be well. If possible, choose a MO who specializes in BC, preferably he/she has participated in research trials. Also, think about consulting a MO from another top facility. in my case both institutions can read my test, procedures, etc online so coordination is easy. On family, only you can know when to tell them, I do not broadcast to the world, but my family knows everything, it's a great comfort when I worried about a result, even with so long a history, you'd think it would be easy, it's really not, but I can keep my fear at bay with their help. Sometimes when I feel low, I say to myself, hey I'm still here, it's a good day. Peace, Kathy",

This will numb the area, the nurse also suggested putting a small square of Saran Wrap over the port after applying the cream. Also, since you are intending to use it for other types of infusions, make sure they flush the port before and after use and the person is licensed and is experienced with a port. We also wear masks when they draw blood from the port to prevent contamination. JFL is correct about the measurements, they do not include depth. In Jan, I will ask for this measure as well as % of my lesions in both lobes. So far, my blood work and liver enzymes are good. Additional tests that are run for me are platelet, rbc and wbc morphology along with CBC , CMP 4 weeks out of 6. TMs are run on a cycle. They are online with a tab for past histories and a tab for graphs. All my other tests are also included with histories and graphs where appropriate. On CTs, I read the summaries , however, I may ask for access to the scans. I have seen them but I would need more interpretation. I do trust my MO who only treats breast cancer, I have a separate hematologist and a consulting MO at another facility. She has a great team and they are responsive, when I send the MO a question I get an answer, she is brief and direct , however that is my preference.

I am waiting for results and will know tomorrow, so I have been keeping very busy. Friends help, for me music is important as a great emotional absorber, shopping, excersize, anything that distracts from cancer thoughts. Although this is my first scan since DX I am pretty calm. I'm know if things are not as I hope I will feel it but I'm not letting Cancer ruin my life. There is hope and good treatments for both of us. Hugs , Kathy",

They are posted on line in my medical chart and if they are not posted I request them from the clinical coordinator. This gives me time to think about the results calmly and focus on what I need to know. I will have scans next Monday and expect results Tuesday or Wednesday, Thursday I will see the MO. Suems, What is important is clear communication between your medical providers and you. Be firm in what you expect in notifying you when a result is expected, if necessary ask when they will get back to you, if they don't call or email, a written request usually gets their attention. I did this with a plastic surgeon a few years ago and I noticed when I wrote he responded quickly. Hope the new drugs will help you. ",
