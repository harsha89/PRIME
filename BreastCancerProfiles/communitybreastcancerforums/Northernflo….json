May I ask how your ILC was found, and how the other areas were eventually found? I found the lump myself, and after the biopsy came back positive had MRI of both breasts. On MRI things look okay except for the spot I found, but I am of course worried that there's more than can be seen given the sneaky nature of ILC. Hoping that is not the case.",
