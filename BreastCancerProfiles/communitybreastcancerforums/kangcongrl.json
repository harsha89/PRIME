My heart goes out to you and my thoughts and prayers are with you. I recieved my results today and feel so very fortunate that they are B9. A MRI and another Mammo in a few months just to make sure but I'm not going to let that worry me, I know it is set up just as a precaution. Just going through this experience has changed me, and I have so much respect for the women who were not as fortunate as I am to get the B9 result. Good luck and best wishes to you KWilli.",
