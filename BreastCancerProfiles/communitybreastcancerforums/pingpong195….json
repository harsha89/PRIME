      "Content": "Dec 4, 2017 11:45AM - edited Dec 4, 2017 11:54AM by pingpong1953 Hi there! I was on exactly the same chemo regimen as you're going to have. Started on July 5 with the FEC and had my last taxotere in mid-October. As far as side effects are concerned, they were very different for the different drugs. I got a ton of anti-nausea meds for the FEC, and they worked pretty well. I had a bit of nausea a few times but never vomited, which was a huge relief. I've heard such horror stories! I didn't do anything to prevent hair loss, since an ice cap sounds incredibly uncomfortable and keeping my hair wasn't worth the hassle. It started falling out exactly 2 weeks after the first FEC dose and I got my head shaved the next day. When I was doing the taxotere the chemo nurse kept me supplied with gloves with ice packs in them, so I've had little trouble with fingernails.My main side effects with the taxotere were shortness of breath and fatigue. I felt like a 90-year-old woman for a while, but the side effects slowly went away and I'm feeling pretty good now. I'm just curious: where do you live? There seems to be some sort of geographical pattern to what chemo we receive.",

I live in northern Ontario, which is pretty sparsely populated, but there are Cancer Centres in the larger cities that serve these communities. The one where my oncologist is located is about 2 hours away, so I've been there quite a few times these past couple of months but I'll be having the rest of my treatments in the city where I live. (The province has grants that help to defray the cost of the trip if you live more than 60 miles away.) There's also a fantastic volunteer group at the Centre, including a groups who knit or crochet great big blankets that are given to all new chemo patients for us to keep. The one I picked has grey, white and yellow stripes and is absolutely beautiful. Speaking of knitting, every table in each waiting area at the Centre has a basket with several types of yarn and a variety of knitting needles. While you're waiting you can start a new square or pick up one that's already been started and add a few rows. (Apparently these same volunteers take the \"nice\" squares and sew them together to make comforters, however not the ones we're given at 1st chemo.) I'm not sure if this is done at other hospitals, but it strikes me as such a great idea. Knitting is a nice way to relax and is much more interesting than 3-year-old magazines!",

My neupogen came in pre-filled syringes that had to be refrigerated. I suggest taking the syringe out of the fridge about 30 minutes before the injection - that way it doesn't hurt. It's a bit uncomfortable injecting cold liquid into yourself. As far as the nausea, etc is concerned, take all of the premeds exactly as ordered and you should be pretty good. I did have some nausea a few times but they had prescribed a separate \"just in case\" anti-nausea med that worked. My biggest problem was fatigue and there's no quick fix for that.

You may start out with good veins but then have them damaged during your treatment. Have you considered a PICC line? It's easy to put in and quite comfortable. The only hassle is having to keep it clean and dry. I used Press and Seal plastic wrap to cover mine up when I took a shower and it worked really well.

At least my kitchen's nice and clean - on to the laundry! Unlike most of the folks on this forum, I take Neupogen rather than Neulasta. I live in Ontario and Neupogen is covered by our health plan, although people with private prescription insurance (usually employer-based) can probably go for the Neulasta. It means I have to give myself 8 injections for each cycle, but I don't mind at all. It saves the province a bunch of money and it really isn't difficult. If I were to have a problem with the injections then a home health nurse would come to my home every day to give them to me. And I wonder if getting it gradually helps to lessen the bone pain. Last time I had some really impressive pain a few hours after my last shot. It only lasted about 18 hours and Tylenol pretty much took care of it. I'm expecting a few rough days ahead, but hopefully they won't last too long. Sending out positive thoughts to all of you!",

Luckily I had just gotten a shipment of scarves and hats that morning, so I was pretty well set. I got my head shaved the following day because my scalp was so sore I couldn't stand even putting a comb through it, much less washing and styling it. My hairdresser is a sweetheart - she doesn't charge for chemo head shaves and she schedules them after her last appointment of the day so there's no \"audience.\" I was quite comfortable with the whole thing, since my hair is thick and it was making such a mess - white hair + dark floors = lots of dry-mopping. I did the \"Look Good Feel Better\" workshop on Tuesday (I haven't worn makeup on a regular basis for years) and at the end of the day when I was getting ready to go to bed I took off my hat and immediately thought of the movie \"To Wong Foo Thanks For Everything Julie Newmar.\" Anyone who's seen the movie probably knows what I'm talking about - I looked just like one of the \"ladies\" after full makeup and before adding the wig. Cracked myself up!",

I'm 2 weeks out from my last Taxotere so I'm a bit behind you, but I also have the ridges on my fingernails and the watering eyes, which I didn't realize is a SE. My taste buds are slowly recovering but I'm nowhere near 90 percent - maybe half way there? My toenails are sore but haven't started changing colour or anything like that. Fingernails are not bothering me yet, although my cell phone no longer recognizes my finger print. Perhaps there's some very subtle reshaping going on???",

I could have gotten away with a lumpectomy if I could have done the rads, but I didn't want to risk it, so I opted for a mastectomy (with lymph node removal) and chemo, which is considered as good as lumpectomy/rads/chemo. I'm very comfortable with what I did. ",
