They gave me a anti nausea patch which lasted three days that with the Iv anti nausea drugs I was not sick at all. I woke with very little pain, mostly under my right armpit where they removed nodes and betweenwhere my breasts were I believe this pain is from the drains. The compression bandage causes me some discomfort. The best thing I found for my drains is a cobbler apron worn inside out. I drop the drains into the pockets the apron snaps up the front, it is sleeveless so easy to get on and off. I got mine from woman within. I sleep in a lift chair recliner we inherited with our house so glad we kept it. Mainly I feel weak and the numbness of my chest bothers me. I get light headed easily, just a trip to the bathroom makes my head spin. I started eating prunes, three a day, before surgery so no constipation. Taking very little meds for pain",

He said it's a reoccurrence of the breast cancer. He also said I may need a hip replacement or pins. I'm waiting for a MRI appointment to see what's next. My question is don't they have to do a biopsy to say absolutely its cancer? I asked if he was certain and he said yes. Other than severe leg pain I feel great! No weight loss no fatigue more than normal.",
