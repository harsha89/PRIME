I'll try to shout out to you all individually in a later post, but for now, to all: \"Welcome!\" I just completed 7 of 27 rads to my left breast. I do special breathing where they tape a transmitter thingie on my diaphragm and I've learned to inhale and hold it to get to 96.3. I have absolutely no idea what 96.3 means, except that they're happy when I maintain my breath at that level. It keeps the rads from hitting my heart. I do one long and one short dose of radiation on each side. After a nasty reaction to Medline cream, I am now using mediaderm about six times a day. Techs and nurse suggest using it as much as I can after rads. I'm supplementing with Boiron Calendula and I've got fresh aloe Vera if it gets really red. I'm having itchy underarm. Can't shave and can only use Toms of Maine deodorant. Radiation hits left underarm on the way to left breast. It gets hot and itchy! Ugh! I joke that I've hijacked a popular song as my anthem: \"My boob is on fi-yerrrrr!\" I found out yesterday that I'm ER+, and for DCIS they only want to offer tamoxifen. I'm not so happy. After 3 very unpleasant hormone threatments back in my 20s for endometriosis, I've always said that I wouldn't do hormone therapy again unless there was a gun to my head. I guess there's a gun to my head now..... I think that will mean that I've gone through the menopause experience a total of 5 times. I'm so tired of it. So, now, I'm researching tamoxifen and all its side effects are scary. However, a recurrence is scarier, so.... I hate BC. hate it hate it hate it Sorry to be so negative, but I think I've hit the \"flat\" stage that so many talk about. I just can't get excited about anything; BC messes with your head as much as it messes with your breasts! The ladies on this list are amazing. Inspiring, encouraging, knowledgeable, and so, so compassionate. Watch our for JustJean though, she'll tease you with cookies!",

I went to visit my retina specialist to discuss upcoming Tamoxifen treatment (it can cause retina problems). During the visit, he decided my eye disease previously thought to be a slow-progressing, rare condition similar to macular degeneration might actually be a macular degeneration, and the worst form of it. I'm only 54, so it was not what I had expected to hear during the visit. Bad eye condition, piled on top of cancer -- needless to say I was \"blindsided\" by the news. (Sorry, but a little gallows humor is all I've got going for me right now!) I'm waiting on the results of genetic testing to determine if his suspicions are correct. Am I the only one who is truly sick to death of waiting, waiting, waiting on something or the other??? I finished 17 of 27 rads today. I had a breast reduction/lift about 8 years ago. The scars had faded nicely. Had... Now, the anchor-shaped scar under my breast, along with most of my lower breast, is dark brownish-black -- like it has been burned or singed. The bottom part of the scar, which curves under my breast, feels like it is burning almost all the time. I have very fair skin, so I'm not terribly surprised. There's no blistering or peeling -- just redness and soreness. My nipple has also turned a purplish black color. One of the RO's asked, \"Has your nipple always been that dark?\" \"Erm, no,\" I said, and showed him the other one -- light tan colored. I may end up with completely mismatched boobs... One of the techs patted me and told me my skin was doing very well. ??? I told my RO that I think one of her techs is smoking crack during her break! I think the tech was trying to make me fell better, but all she did was lose any credibility she'll ever have. The RO gave me more lidocaine lotion and I'm adding Boiron calendula cream to the miaderm Im already using. I'll probably buy aloe gel tomorrow. Honestly, I'm questioning my choice to do lumpectomy over mastectomy. I wouldn't be looking at Tamoxifen and I think my breast would probably look and feel better in the long-term. Has anyone else questioned their choice? Sorry to be such a whiner. Congrats to those who've finished rads and welcome to those just starting. ",

I'm attaching a photo from my breast at 22/27 rads. It doesn't look as bad in the photo as it was and it got worse... My RO commented on the swelling, which IS normal, but what she didn't realize was that it was swelling from an undiagnosed seroma. I had noticed a small spot next to the lumpectomy incision, with a tiny scab in it. She noticed it, too, but it just looked like a small nick or \"divot\" shape that was healing next the the scar. Now, I realize it probably was a nick from the surgery. Last weekend, as my skin was sloughing off, a fish-scale looking piece of skin fell off the spot. When it did, clear yellow liquid started oozing out like crazy. Needless to say, I was in the doctor's office the next day. RO sent me to surgeon. His resident poked the tiny hole with the end of a swab and there was a gush of fluid all over me. Long story short, I started rads with a big seroma. Basically, ALL of the area underneath the nipple, plus more, was an empty, unhealed space full of fluids. It's now packed with gauze and silver gel. Tomorrow, I start hyperbaric treatments to speed up healing. 20-40 treatments, each 2+ hours, plus 2 hours rt travel. quiggie: If you're still sore, have them do an ultrasound to see if the seroma is back. I had unusual soreness the first week of rads. The nurse just kept telling me it couldn't be from rads. It wasn't, she was right. But she or the RO should have looked harder to figure out what it was. ",

I have a strong faith, and I just keep reminding myself that I'm never alone in this journey, no matter how I feel. CoyoteNV: The suggestion to look at the Fall rads board was exactly what I needed. I also talked to my RO today. Apparently, it's just an extreme-looking reaction, but will not be permanent. It really looks horrible, but I can live with it for a while longer. Bird girl, Cath57, Sandylovelucy, MagicalBean, Nomatterwhat: Thanks for sharing your experiences. BC involves SO MANY decisions and the learning curve is steep. I love my RO, but I do think she downplayed the effects of rads, just as I think my MO is downplaying the side effects of Tamoxifen. When I start taking tamoxifen, I will experience my FIFTH \"menopause.\" In my twenties, had three different hormone suppression therapies for endometriosis. I dealt with real menopause a couple of years ago, and now will get the experience the hot flashes, night sweats and crankiness all over again. The good news is that I feel like I know what to expect -- all too well! lol I'm normally pretty positive, but the non-stop burning is really bugging me. They gave me 3 new creams to try today: RadiaplexRX Gel, Regenecare HA, and Medline Nutrashield. When the skin starts having open sores, they will use something called \"honey patches.\" I have a rads clinic friend who is 6 visits ahead of me. Same RO, same breast, same treatment. She's only had minor discomfort. It's just my sensitive skin. I'm obsessive about applying the creams. I think my breast would look like raw meat, otherwise. Thanks again to all of you for your kindness. Reading your words was uplifting. Just what I needed! ",

It didn't make sense that it was the rads, because I 'd only had 2 treatments and my skin hadn't gotten pink. Long story short, it was the Medline Skin Repair Cream AND the tapes they used to attach a a roll of bubblewrap over a skin fold on my armpit. I have very sensitive skin, so I'm looking for a new, very mild, cream. I would appreciate any suggestions. If anyone can use 2 brand new tubes of Medline cream, PM me and I'll send them to you. I'm grateful to be a part of this group",

So far, there's no improvement in the size of my seroma, but they didn't really expect any. Because there's only a tiny drain hole, they did a breast ultrasound to determine the size. It's a 2/3 moon shape, just about the size of my nipple. There's still no infection, thankfully, so hopefully it will start to close soon. Next Thursday, they're injecting it with a mixture of my own plasma and platelets which will have been treated with a hormone to stimulate healing. Good news for all: The terrible discoloration and peeling DOES get better after a couple of weeks! My breast is still not \"normal,\" but it's better than I ever thought it would be. I really wish they would do a quick breast ultrasound before signing off for radiation. They would immediately spot a seroma and could allow more time for healing. The chamber dives take 5-6 hours out of my day, nearly every weekday. It's such a huge time drain, and could have easily been prevented... I meet with gyno and MO on Wednesday, so I've been reading lots about Tamoxifen. I can't wait to see what assortment of SEs I draw in the Tamoxifen lottery! My plan is to have a total hysterectomy, so that I'm not always looking over my shoulder for endometrial cancer. I already have 4 other conditions that increase my risk of endometrial cancer, including fibroids, which mimic the symptoms of EC. I don't want to spend the rest of my life wondering \"Is it cancer or is it just fibroids?\" Congrats to all who have finished and good wishes to all in treatment!",

I've finally got the combination of creams figured out, so I'm doing much better. Only 5 more to go after today! My RO said sensitive skin just reacts more strongly and is harder to treat/protect because many of the creams can cause additional irritation. I'm so thankful she and the nurses kept working with me to get the right combination. They've also given me a supply of disposable post/surgical \"breathable\" bras all the time. The more air I get, the better it heals and the less it holds heat. I don't care so much how it looks, thankfully!",

Scrubs and a space helmet, seated inside a pressure chamber with 5 strangers for 2 hours each day. Needless to say, the photo is a model. I haven't looked that perky in... well... I honestly don't remember ever looking that perky! The important thing for all rads patients to know is that the hyperbaric doc told me that if I ever need surgery on that breast -- for anything -- it is a good idea to have 10 hyperbaric treatments beforehand. Our skin is forever damaged and healing is forever impeded. The hyperbaric doc said he sees a lot of patients who have \"past radiation\" issues. Not a fun Google topic. I have to say ladies, knowing what I know now, I would have definitely chosen mastectomy. Not a lot of good it does me now, but if I ever have problems with the right breast, it'll be a different scenario. Sorry to be so Debbie Downer. I'm just being real. For those who are so inclined, I would welcome your prayers. I am really having a hard time getting over my anger and disappointment with this new development. I had \"rung the bell\" and put my handprint on the wall. I had made it through and had big plans for the next months. I was generally very upbeat, even through the pain of rads. I need to get my positive focus and humor back. I don't enjoy being grouchy. On an intellectual level, I know this, too, shall pass. I just haven't gotten there emotionally/spiritually. Thanks for listening!",

It contained citrus and floral essences that apparently I was sensitive to. I ended up dealing with sensitivities I didn't know I had. Tape and the adhesive on the sticky spots, until they started using paper tape. Ask about changing your cream. I was sensitive to all of the crewms made by Medline. Miaderm is a good one for the first part. Also, ask about gels or lotions that contain lidocaine. Lidocaine can become your best friend! :)",

Winter selection has plenty of fabrics designed to hold in heat. That's the last thing we all need. HOWEVER, I recently found super-soft, long 100% cotton tanks on sale at The Gap. They were $4.97 each and I got white, navy and black. They have S-XL in-store. They run large, btw. I would think the XL would easily work for anyone who is XXL or very large-breasted. I love them! They may be available online, as well. Hope this helps someone. :)",
