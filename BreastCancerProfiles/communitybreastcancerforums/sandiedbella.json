    "Content": "sandiedbella wrote: Hello everyone. I've very recently had some bizarre symptoms that I reported to my onc.  Dizziness, nausea, crazy words coming out of my mouth, putting a pizza in the oven, then asking my 3 year old what he wants for dinner (mama...you're making me a pizza!), constant (although minor) headaches, face feels hot, sometimes tingly, and my head feels \"full\".  Had an MRI this week, but onc is out of town until next and his office won't provide results in his absence. Just curious if anyone else has encountered these crazy symptoms and had it turn out to be allergies?  ;)  I did recently go off of Tamoxifen for a trial period (it's been 40 days) but am still taking Effexor. Thanks much! Dx 8/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 1/7 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
