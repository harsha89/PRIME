Today I visited doc and she said that my lump on neck area has decreased ( I can also touch it's decressement) and that I will take a higher dose of Caelyx (:))) 40mg instead of 20 mg) every 4 weeks with Zometa. Every 15 days I wiil continue Herceptin. I used to take the three drugs every 21 days all together till now. I wish she didn't see anything bad and increased the dose because she said we have to continue for some more circles. I wish the lump will go away as soon as possible :(. I am on chemo from February 2009 with four months break. Doc also gave me a lot of usufull infos about the red hand and feet from that previous drug Xeloda. She recommende me Gedwol creme and Dactarin powder for the problematic skin areas and Alcohol Iode that the pharmacist made for nails issues. She also insisted on thaking B6.

This is the opinion of a well known doc who says that it is not nesseccary to have stage I , II, and III cancer to end up with a stage IV diagnosis. Sometime it can simply occur with stage IV at the first place. Of course another opinion says that these cases are the ones that is very difficult to be diagnosed at early stages- for example if the patient doesn't find a lump or doesn't do the right tests. I always believed that cancer has to act for many years before it can be touchable, even decates. But after all the mammos that I had and finally diagnosed stage IV in one night I have to reconsider this sentence. The doc I mentioned has compared the stages with different kind of apples. If the seed is for the red apple a red apple tree will sprout. On the other side if the seed is for green ones a green apple tree will sprout. The doc says that in the same way some stage IVs are ment to develop stage IV at the first place.

But since this is a matter of genes according to all the new researches couldn't the potential of a gene be expressed with different types of cancer? I am 29 and I am planning to have children soon.

And I would do anything that could prevent this to be passed to my children. I am overconcerning (I wish very very falsly) because I am thinking very much the option to get pregnant as soon as possible.  Since my mom is on chemo the first thing I think is HER and of course I wouldn't let anything disturb her tranquility! I have discussed with my mom about the family tree but I won't ask her to do any needle test unless docs ask her to do so. I am planning to go and do that test without getting her involved. I can't imagine her anxious about my test! She has a lot of things to be anxious about and definitely I shouldn't be one more.",

OK someone must be joking with me ... The doc asked me if I had rads with the previous \"therapy\" (my nerves - shouldn't he remember or shouldn't he have read my folder before asking?). When I told him no  he said it is great we have this arm to help now. I understood that it is the first time that the therapies act. And if I have chemo now will it worth the try since it will be the second one? I am confused. Are there any members that had so earky recurance and live for some time-years or is it a death sentence?

I have started a mini search for Afinitor and if anyone has used it or has heard anything please let me know.. Of course I have mixed feeling on this because it seems like I am running out of chemos. On the other hand it could be better than just having chemos that will not work.  I also want to tell you I have a great improvement with my skin rash and last week went out of the hospital and returned to my daily life!!! I can walk without pain (which couln't due to hand and foot syndrom) and do everything as before the last chemo's dermatological side effect. Today I started decresing cortizone and I will take only Herceptin and Zometa until September.Then I will have to decide if I will give Afinitor a chance.

I have an appointment for pet scan on Wednesday and cross my fingures that it will not show anything more... The \"funny\" thing is that in Greece with the economical crisis, the economical minister desided that we have to pay for pet scans from this September because it is a not \"needed\"(one pet scan per year was free for stage ivs) . There are other tests (sacns, mammos) that can reviel problems ... Someone has to tell him that pet scan is a different test and can save lives!!!

I see a lot of you are still hanging on but it is very dark in our place.... After my last summer Femara disappointment I take (since January) Xeloda and Tyverb. This combo started with good signs and it shrunk my tumour above my left ear that is still working. However the drugs are not working since I feel the little growth. After two combos taht failed what should I expect? Should I be happy for the months that it keeped me or should I feel it was a waste of time? My doc says when a drug doesn't work we try to find another that will. Easy to be said that done! Right now  I am feeling like a guinea-pig. I cannnot imagine what the plan is but it is a very hard road to drive. Things happen in our bodies without asking us. And I need not 1 or 2 new drugs but thousants if everything is working for just 3 months. The fact that nothing lasts for long makes me very sceptical but I am feeling quite good bodily. I think it's the psychology that is down down down... The only good thing is that this forum is a huge community all around the world that I feel I can rest peacefully in it's hug.I keep you in my heart and take energy for the fight every sleepless night.  Goodnight to all of you!

I am feeling very well with a little side effects so far. The metastasis in my supraclavicular area is not touchable any more after the 3rd round of chemo and I was told that the chemo is really working.  My doc said that the bone mets will disapear with the chemo and that nowdays early stage bone metastasis is not even noticable. Since now it is true. However, yesterday I had a swelling arm from the left elbow to the hand and my doc said I should take some antiflammatory. As I was told it must be lymphadema.. The docs didn't say anything about such a side effect. I am reading about accupuncture, sleeves or other ways to solve the problem. What should I do? Could it become worse?

If the first treatment was to work for 3 years for example then the next one would be there for you but I guess it will work for less time.

I have two different diagnosis for er. The hospitals result says ER+ 90%  and a seconds opinions doc result says that the positivity of ER should not be evaluated (for some medical resons I cannot transalate in English). Unfortunatelly we didn't show this to the docs at first.. I am scared. The first hormonal treatment failed. Why will the next one be a success? I was told I was ned on September and now what? Of course I will be greatfull if this f.... thing starts to shrink. But doc said that I was supposed to have a recurrance after 3 years if Femara worked. I don't have the sick appearance and this may mislead even docs. From last September I had only 2 months to relax. I just want to take the new treatment soon...
