If the cancer doesn`t get me the stress will, I am normally a very level headed person but my mind has gone into overdrive. Do you have a b.c. nurse? I am in the U.K.and because of the level of stress that  scans cause me my onc. has agreed that my b.c. nurse can give me the results by phone, sadly for me she went on holiday the day after my last scan hence the state I am in!!  I have lung mets and have had four cycles of Vinoralbine, Capecetabine didn`t work well enough for me although my onc.said he might put me back on it at a later date. All will be revealed tomorrow thank goodness, is that when you get yours? Take care,Jan",
