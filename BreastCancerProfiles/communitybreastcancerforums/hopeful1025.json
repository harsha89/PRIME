I am 35 years old and I have never had any issues with lumps in my breasts before. Last week, I noticed a small red bump on the under right side of my right breast. Like a crazy woman, I dismissed it as a bug bite and continued to get dressed. Crazy, I know... Last night, I was taking off my clothes and felt the bump again. This time it caught my attention. It feels like it has gotten bigger and has a bruised look to it. Well, you all already know what I did next... Yep! I went on Google and scared myself out of an entire night's sleep and into the urgent care first thing this morning for fear of having IBC. I saw a NP who quickly looked at it and said, \"oh, that is just a skin abscess.\" Huh?! I told her that I was concerned about the potential of BC; IBC, in particular and that I have a history of cancer in my family (my mother passed from colon cancer when I was 15). She slowed down and explained to me that she thought it was an abscess/boil or a minor skin infection because of its appearance and because it was not attached to the breast tissue. It is located on the surface of the breast. She also said that she felt it was an abscess because of the perfectly round shape. However, there is no pain and I never remember feeling pain. I thought boils/abscess' are supposed to be painful...? I read that BC can also appear on the surface of the breast and does not also present itself attached to the breast tissue. She offered to see if she could drain any fluid from the \"abscess\" but said she might not be able to, as it is not that large and has not come to a head. I asked her to try anyway. She was unable to drain any puss from the lump. Only a little blood came out. She prescribed me 10 days of antibiotics and told me to use a warm compress over the next 10 days. She also suggested that I follow up with my GP tomorrow to schedule an appointment to make sure that it is healing as it should, which of course, I will. I am petrified that this lady was rushing and has no idea what she was talking about, as she did not perform an ultrasound - only a breast exam. So, I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? I am literally on pins and needles!! I CANNOT wait to make my appointment tomorrow!!! Thoughts? Suggestions?? Thank you in advance!

In fact, since I have a PPO, I was thinking about scheduling an appointment with a specialist tomorrow instead. That way I can go straight to the cancer center. At the very least, they could do an ultrasound this week and perhaps schedule the mammogram for next week, if they are busy. I suppose I will just have to wait and see what they say. But yea... I was contemplating going straight to the horses mouth (so to speak). I am BEYOND anxious!",

The nurse said that is probably best because it will allow the antibiotics (10 day) prescription to work, if this is in fact an abscess. BUT there is a healthcare facility that I have gone to a few times on the campus where I teach, and they provide quality services. I might make a tiny little appointment in the meantime as a second opinion to this abscess diagnosis because I know they will be able to get me in over the next few days. They are closed today for President's Day, but I might call tomorrow morning and see what they have available in the coming days. ....and so the waiting game officially begins. I keep looking at my breast. I am not sure why... Even if it is an abscess, (fingers crossed and prayers up!) I don't think there would be a noticeable difference by now. UGH!",

He said that it is on the skin's surface, so it could be a skin lesion but it could also be intraductal papiloma, which he said also presents with slight bruising and can appear either on the skin's surface or attached to the breast tissue. I understand that the only way to know FOR SURE is to get a mamm, which is why I was going to request one in spite of the OB NP being so confident that it is skin lesion/abscess. I don't know... Maybe, it's because he suggested it before I could, is concerning. I know that he wants to be sure and that he more than likely would not want to be overly confident in proclaiming any informal diagnosis one way or the other at this point. But... I don't know... I guess it just boils down - to it's still unknown and it's still scary. I am waiting for a call from the breast center to schedule my mamm. But I might call them toward the end of the day to expedite the process. So, that's my story for today. That's all I got.",

It is located almost right between my nipple and the very bottom on my breast where the underwire in my bra would hit. Also, the lump itself is smaller. I remember when I first discovered it 2 weeks ago, I was able somewhat feel it in between my fingers. I could almost pinch it. But now it is much flatter and I can no longer pinch it. It does; however, still have what looks like a bruised appearance. But now that I am looking at it, I think it's turning more into skin discoloration now and not necessarily a bruise. I am black with somewhat fair complexion and it's looks like it is becoming discolored similar to how an awful facial blemish or pimple might discolor my skin after it has been picked at and it has healed. I'm not sure if these are good or bad signs. Ha! Either way, I am hanging in there and thankful that my GP was on board to order the mamm.

The radiologist said that I am in the clear and what I have appears to be in fact be an abscess. They did find an area (at the 10 o'clock position of my breast) but that turned out to be excess breast tissue. They told me that I should get a follow-up mamm once I turn 40. Whew! Now, onto schedule my colonoscopy.  ",

I have been searching the site to refrain from visiting our best friend Dr. Google (lol), but can't find any info. I just had a light bulb moment. About two weeks ago, my significant other and I were playing around and he kinda pinched me on my right breast. **Sorry, I know this might be TMI** I remember it stinging and saying to him, \"that hurt!\" and I hit his arm. It stung a little but the sensation went away after a few minutes and I did not think about it again... Shortly after that incident is when I discovered the initial red bump in the mirror that is now bruised. Hmmm... I could be over thinking this. I know that fat necrosis is caused by damage to fatty tissue, but I am not sure how strong the impact has to be. A firm pinch that stung a few minutes might not qualify....",

I spoke with her about my situation. She was very reassuring but also encouraged me to (if possible) not wait until my GP is available on March 2 and try to get in to see a OBGYN at the wellness center on our campus. She highly recommended him and said that I should not wait, if I can help it. Tomorrow I literally have a packed day at another another school from 8:30-3:40, but I will do what I have to do to schedule an appointment to see the OB tomorrow or Wednesday. Preferably tomorrow... This is such a powerless feeling...",

I plan to get one last opinion and hopefully a US for the lump AND ask him to order a colonoscopy ASAP. I am not at all taking for granted anything at this point! I have, however, noticed a slight change in the lump. Almost as though it is healing. So, perhaps it is some sort of skin abscess. Either way, I'll be seeing my GP on Thursday and hopefully I will receive final peace of mind about the lump and start the process of scheduling my colonoscopy. Thank you again for sharing your story!",
