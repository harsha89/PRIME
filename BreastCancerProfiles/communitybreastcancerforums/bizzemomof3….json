Also my fathers sisters all 3 of them have breast cancer the youngest being diagnosed at age 41 also paternal grandmother her 2 sisters hade it. I am now 35 and was supposed to go get my mammo at 32. (which I didn't) I have very large and dense breasts. I am getting ready to make an appointment for genetic testing (scared). What I guess I really want to know is if I should fight for the MRI instead of the mammo they say me and my sisters are HIGH RISK. So if someone could help me I would be gratefull. Thanks again.
