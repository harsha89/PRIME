She said she does not see any cancer, mass tissue or calcification and that I should not worry. How can I not, I'm mortified and can't think of anything else. She said it's nothing to worry about and that they just want to take precaution. Please help I'm making myself sick just thinking and worrying about it. I asked if I can be seen sooner but I have to wait until July 1st and that I should not worry. any one else out there that have gone through this?? Log in to post a reply",
