My surgeon went in through my nipple so that I would not have any scarring.  Everything seemed to be healing great until last week when my breast suddenly swelled up into my armpit and became rock hard. For the next day it contiues to change shapes and colors.  This has happened 3 times now in the last week. I saw my surgeon yesterday and she did not seem concerned.  This doesn't seem right to me.  Has anyone else had this happen to them? I appreciate your help. Log in to post a reply",
