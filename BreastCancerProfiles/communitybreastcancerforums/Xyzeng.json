I knew starting out that neoadjuvant chemo doesn't work very well for mucinous breast cancer. (There's a very useful thread on mucinous breast cancer here.) My MO put me on simultaneous neoadjuvant endocrine therapy but the effect was still modest. I do have supraclavicular and suspect internal mammary/mediastinal nodes that no longer show up on PET/CT scan. He thinks that the Create-X trial had sufficiently encouraging results for ER+ for him to put me on Xeloda (or rather a similar drug called TS-1 approved in Asia but not in the US). We are starting this and Prolia with rads, and I'm still on Femara too. He's also willing to give me Ibrance after TS-1 for maintenance. There are no palbociclib trial sites here so I'm grateful for that. ",

My MO wasn't certain about Xeloda until more data from Create-X emerged and only suggested Ibrance initially. I'm glad he eventually recommended both. Will you be on Prolia? That helps to reduce risk too.",

I thought then that it might be the data from the presentation, but that can't be new data. Essentially, he no longer thought only triple negative patients benefited from the Xeloda. Have you considered writing to the researchers? Hi Hammie28. I'm not sure how long we could stay on Ibrance. My MO intends to find out more from a researcher who's involved in the palbociclib trials. From the Ibrance thread, I understand that some Stage IV patients have been on it for as long as 7 years. ",
