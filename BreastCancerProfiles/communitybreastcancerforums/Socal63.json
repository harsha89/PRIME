I had a small area of clustered microcalcifications that showed up on a mammogram then a stereotactic biopsy that confirmed the DCIS. My surgeon has ordered a MRI to further examine the area and lymph nodes so I can better go over my options for treatment. Here is my question.. I am 50 and on low dose birth control pills in order to help with the night sweats. I have never ever had regular periods or only a few a year if at all. Needless to say with menopause approaching I never know when I will have them. I mentioned this to the scheduling nurse at the MRI center when she asked me about the date of my last period. I told her I couldn't remember the date of my last cycle and it could be months or more till I have another one. She said come on in to the appointment. I am wondering if I should mention this to the radiologist as well or maybe call my surgeon ? I don't mean to be so wiggy but any thoughts or advice are appreciated in advance !
