I had my yearly 2 weeks ago. My Dr. (First time with new Dr since change of insurances) felt a \"mass\" as she called it at 11oclock and 1cm away from nipple. I told her that A year ago I had an us on the area because my baseline mammo showed something I think it was .3mm. (Ovarian, breast and colon run heavy in family) my tissue was extremely dense so they did an ultrasound said it was of cystic nature and we would watch it. It seemed to me it disappeared. She said it felt about 1.5cm but felt it was likely a cyst but she was a little concerned because it felt uneven. It felt like a thickness to me like clumped tissue! He also found an enlarged node/lump in my armpit that she said is about 2cm, So I have a Diagnostic bilateral digital mammo and an ultrasound immediately following. My question is will they see the lymph node on mammo to see its size? will they do a mammo on both breasts or just the right? if the lump looks suspicious will they do a biopsy right then and there? It's at a radiology clinic where they have everything in one place, that's where I would get a biopsy if needed. What's your experience with this? Also I didn't mention to my Dr but although I had my son 4yrs ago I have been having the sensation of milk letdown but no milk comes out? Its random and happens only a few times a week, Weird! Thank you so much for the taking the time to read my long story I'm trying not to stress as I've had a lump in left breast 7yrs ago that was nothing but this one \"feels\" different, weird almost! God bless you ladies for your courage to help others get through things like this! Oh I'm 34 and mom had Colon at 42, aunt breast (both idc) at 28, other aunt ovarian at 30, grandma cervical at 35 & lung at 45. Other grandma ovarian at 40. Log in to post a reply",

I called the nurses line and hopefully someone will call me back. Should I bring someone with me incase they do a biopsy?",

Thank you for the answers I had a lumpectomy on my left breast 6yrs ago but it was scheduled and we weren't concerned with it being anything serious. I am gonna just go to my Appointment tomorrow knowing that 80% of all lumps are benign so I'm sure Ill fall into that category! The clinic called and told me today that if they needed a biopsy they usually schedule me to come back unless the radiologist has time sometimes he will go ahead and get a few samples! I've calmed down a lot after speaking with the nurse. She stated my dr noted the lump was about 2.5cm and she said they noted my swollen lymph node so they will also get that during the ultrasound. Thanks again for your response, going trick or treating with kids so ill be too excited and exhausted to worry about this silly Ole lump :) happy Halloween!",
