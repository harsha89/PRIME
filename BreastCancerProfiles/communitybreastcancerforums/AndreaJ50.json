But it is unbelievable how many people will reach out to help you along. Take the help that they offer, and someday you will help others. Ladydi950, I too opted for a lumpectomy, for the same reasons that you stated. I also hope it is the right choice. Baby steps. Looks like we are starting this journey together. Hugs to you both!

This is the worst part I think, waiting for results. Our minds question every little nuance and fill in the blanks. Try to distract yourself if you can while you await the news.

If it is the Tamoxifen causing it I will just have to get used to it. Might find out more when I see my Oncologist in Sept. Kidneystone hasn't been too bad really... It was much worse when I thought it was Liver Mets....I am seeing a pattern here!!! I miss the days when every ache and pain wasn't suspect. Doubt I will get my DH anywhere near a scalpel. Might try the bricks after all, lol. Take care everyone and have a peaceful night! Still smiling from that photo of the chick!! Hugs all around! Andrea",
