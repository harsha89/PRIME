I have been told since I developed the liver mets that the MRI is the most accurate scan. The CT scan said \"probably decreased in number\" while the MRI said,\"previously seen hepatic lesions are no longer visible.\" Also, I was told the radiologist follows both scans, but considers the MRI the standard test.",

I have learned so much from your posts and have gotten advice, support and hope from so many of you. I am constantly in awe of your kindness, generosity and concern for each other. I am a long time breast cancer patient/survivor. I have written about my cancer journey before on this site, but for those who may not have seen it, this summarizes my story. I was first diagnosed and treated in 1975, then again in 2004 and then in 2013 with MBC in the bones. I was treated for 2 1/2 years with letrozole. In January of 2017, i was diagnosed with liver lesions and went into the Monarch clinical trial, which was a 3 drug treatment. I wasn't able to tolerate the 3rd drug, LY3023414, but was kept on fulvestrant and a lower dose of abemaciclib, 100 mg, twice a day. As part of the trial I have regulat MRI and CT scans- for the first year every 2 months, now every 3. The last 2 scans showed significant reduction in the lesions, and the great news is that the last scans showed a 100% response to the liver lesions, meaning they are gone!!. At my dr's appt yesterday, there were hugs and kisses all around from my doctor and the clinical nurses!! The lesions are followed and evaluated by a radiologist who prepares a Recist Report ( a response assessmenmt form). My Onc also said that the 3 drug treatment has been approved. I hope that this info will show that there is hope in the new treatments that have have been developed recently and may also prompt some of you to consider abemaciclib if you have been reluctant to. I have been able to tolerate the side effects without having to change my every day life to do so. (The reduction in dosage of abemaciclib may be one of the reasons) I work part time 2 days a week, and my DH and I just returned from a 14 day cruise. I have been dealing with this disease for 40+ years, and I amy still here!!! My thoughts are always with of all of you as you stuggle to live your lives as best as you can. I am saddened by the difficulties and disappointments you experience. I am uplifted by your successes and spirits on this difficult journey. Love to all of you. ",
