She felt it also, as well as other possible lumps in the right breast (I have fibroadenoma and maybe two or three more ...) She gave me paper to do mamogram + ultrasound and even biopsy if needed. She dosen't think it is cancer, but I have to wait 2 weeks now (appointment in 2nd september) as she told me to go to a specific breast center. Now I ll have to wait again. trying to stay postive, and keep my hand away from my breast. I know mammo is a hard time to bear, I really panicked the first time. unfortunately, there is no choice left. Thank you ladies..",

Things have been changing and I was not able to come as I was a little bit busy. So I went to breast clinic and I didn't get a mammogram as I found out that I was pregnant !! I only got an ultrasound and doctor said in right breast I got 3 lumps and 4 lumps in left breast ! She said they were all fibroadenomas the biggest one was about 3cm !!! Any how as I was pregnant she told me to come back in 4 mouths so in January and than we will see. The problem is that two days ago I start to feel a tender spot under my left armpit . And I unfortunately found what I think is a lymph node :( there is a smaller one in the right armpit . So I don t know what to do ! Wait until January or go to my general doctor although she is not taking me seriously (she said I am over reacting every time I saw her ) Is there any chance this lymph node is b9 ? Now I am carrying a baby and so afraid that I was misdiagnosed and it is too late ! :( Thank you for advice/help/prayers ",

My story starts 2 years ago, doctor found a lump that turned out to be a benign fibroadenoma, it hasn't gotten bigger since. But when all this happend, I was so scard, it was a very hard time to go through. By taht time I was single, and lived alone ... Really depressing. Any way, yestarday, taking a shower. I found out another big lump in the other breast. Nedless to say I am freaking out. This one is quite bigger than the one I had before. But I can't really tell if it feeld the same. I am not a doctor. Any way, I have to call a doctor and go through the whole process again, It just scares me a lot and I am feeling so sad about my hasbund (i got married since, and he is so nice to me) as I didn't stop having health issues. Well ladies, please I need confort going through all of this again. I am just feeling down, I went throuh a misscariage 6 monthes ago, have blood issues etc etc Life is so hard, but It can get harder, isnt it ? kiss Log in to post a reply",

I don't know about dimpling breast, but I hope you have benign conditions that make it feel that way. This period of waiting is hard, so hard, but it is gonna be over. And I hope that it is gonna be a benign fibroadenoma or something like that... Take care  and stay strong",
