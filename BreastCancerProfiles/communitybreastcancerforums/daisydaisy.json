The results are back, shortly: ER - in 70% of tumour cells (Allred Score 6) PgR - in 40% of tumour cells (Allred Score 3) Ki67 - in 60% of tumour cells HER2/neu - 2+ Conclusion: luminal type B cancer, Her2 - uncertain, confirm with Fish-test. I started another thread for this. I will remain an annoying newbie with stupid questions for a while, sorry about that. Since it's mom's second primary in 2 years (first was colon in 2013), I want to provide best possible treatment for her with all the options we can afford (we are in Russia). And this community is amazing!",

It was a very painful procedure unfortunately, and the breast is still kind of sore. I am just worried - is this normal? Should we apply anything to help? We were told not to do anything specific. Not even ice. If anyone is able to share their experience, I would really appreciate it. Thanks and best wishes to all! Log in to post a reply",

Our doctor says - wait for FISH test to be ready, then chemo (for breast preserving surgery). I kind of freak out to wait another 10 working days, according to US mom already has one lymph node affected. I struggle to solve this puzzle, my head is about to explode. Any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, everyone! Log in to post a reply",

Mom is going to have lumpectomy plus axillary ln dissection (I suggest level I&II), since clinically on her first US one node was affected. Anyway, sentinel node biopsy is not available in Russia. I spent hours googling, but was unable to find a picture of the scar after such dissection. How big is it and where is it exactly? Mom develops keloid scars after any cut, so I want to take care of it in advance. Plus somebody told me the scar in the armpit looks really ugly, and there is like a hole left - but I am not sure about it. If anyone may share their experience, I would very much appreciate it. I have to stock silicone strips in advance to try to stop the scar right from the start. And one more question - how painful this surgery is? What are you supposed to start doing right away - any exercise, massage, therapy? I will try to see a physiotherapist before the surgery, but any input will be very helpful. I do not want to miss anything critical right after. Mom is overweight, I am afraid that puts her at extra risk for lymphedema, we should try to prevent it. Thanks a lot to all of you! Good luck and lots of health to everyone here! Log in to post a reply",
