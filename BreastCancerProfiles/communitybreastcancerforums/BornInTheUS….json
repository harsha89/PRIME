My breast was once labeled over a pea sized lump to help the radiologist and ultrasound technician. As far as labeling the film, I really don't know, but I can't imagine them not indicating which side somehow for each picture. I would suggest you contact your doc and tell him or her again your concerns and ask for a diagnostic on the other side. Being left to worry without being confident in the results should be discussed with your doc. You need to br assured the correct side was viewed. Good luck!",
