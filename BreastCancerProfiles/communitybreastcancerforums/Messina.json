First, I'd like to say this website has been great with sharing helpful information with me. I am 43 years old and my first mammogram in September 2017. I had suspicious calcifications that were biopsied and diagnosed as ADH. It was recommended that I have the excisional biopsy/surgery to verify nothing else was hiding. The surgery was successful and results were just the ADH in my right breast. I have 3 other areas of calcifications that will be watched in my 6-month mammo follow-up, then 12-month MRI follow-up. In early December, I consulted with my oncologist, surgical oncologist, and primary care physician, and all recommended for me to start Tamoxifen since I have been deemed high risk due to the presence of ADH. I have decided to start Tamoxifen tomorrow, Valentine's Day. I am nervous, but confident in my decision after reading all the research and meeting with my team of docs. Any words of advice/encouragement from other's using tamoxifen as a preventative would be appreciated. Thank you :)",
