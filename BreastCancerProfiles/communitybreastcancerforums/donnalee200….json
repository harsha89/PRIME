Each area is split. 1 RS and 1 BS say excise, 1 RS and 1BS say just do follow-ups at this point. I am so confused. I almost feel if it were Stage 0 or even 1...I'd have no problem doing the surgery...but I can't see doing it when there is this much \"gray\" area. I understand that even in more definite cases, the odds are only 10% of anything being beginning states of cancer. I just want to make the right decision...yet nothing is helping me decide. I wish I had a more definite feeling one way or the other.",
