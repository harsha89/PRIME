So I opted for bilateral.mastectomies when I was diagnosed with dcis (low grade).Â I had a biopsy done after a mammogram showed microcalcification on the right breast. I am also doing reconstruction and have expanders in. My genetic tests are still pending, and I've also done a gene panel as mentioned by others un the forum. Do keep in mind that genetic tests are helpful mainly when positive, as tests can only be done and analysed for known mutations, and there's lots of things that we don't know. Also be aware that after bilateral mastectomies , it is known that you still have around 5 per cent of breast tissue left, and that although the recurrence rate is reduced it can never be completely eliminated. Your BS will likely warn you of this, or at least mine did. Having said all that, 3 weeks after having opted for bilateral mastectomies, I am still convinced that this is the best decision I could have taken. My BS and radiologists fully supported my decision particularly as the mammos showed bilateral dense tissue and MRI showed bilateral background parenchymal enhancement making future radiology follow up very difficult. Good luck ðŸ˜Š The worst is the waiting time. Will be thinking of you.",

Have your docs discussed possibility of MR. May be worth thinking about if biopsy is negative since you only get a few mm of the area when you biopsy.",

My genetic results are still pending. My MRI showed bilateral background parenchymal enhancement. In view of my family history (mum and her sis both had advanced idc before age of 45), I opted for bilateral mastectomies and tissue expanders. I'm now in the process of filling and have had 300ccs so far. Waiting for the surgery was by far the worst part. Good luck and take care.",

Steristrips were used to cover which I removed myself after 6 days. I wasnt advised to use icepacks but I was advised to use a sportsbra or tight bra for a few days to prevent haematoma formation , and also to avoid strenous activity including heavy lifting or pushing for at least a week. Particularly important to prevent haematoma formations as these can become infected. Good luck with your path results.",
