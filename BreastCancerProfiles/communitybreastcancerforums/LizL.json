My sister just completed months of chemo for triple negative BC, and her mastectomies are scheduled for next week. It sounds like this new test might be a good idea for her to do between surgery and starting radiation. I wonder if some people could skip or cut down on radiation if such a blood test did not find circulating cancer cells. Log in to post a reply",
