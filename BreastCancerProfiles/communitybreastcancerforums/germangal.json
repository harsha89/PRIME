I too had joint aches when I started, mentioned that to my GP and she suggested I try natural Fish Oil, Omega-3, 1000mg/daily. I checked with onc who said it would be fine. Within a couple of weeks the aches disappeared. I'm fussy about which ones I buy, get them at health center that is run by a licensed naturopath. Might be worth checking with your docs on this.",

Having tax-free access to the money in my 401K would go a long way towards paying property taxes and mortgage until we are able to sell the house & move someplace less expensive. Any words of advice? I'm not Stage 4 - but I do have IBC with its crappy mortality rate... so, please forgive me for posting here, ....",
