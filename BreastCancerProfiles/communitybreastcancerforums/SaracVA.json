The ACT side effects are supposed to be worse, and we decided on the TC based on the risk of heart damage from the ACT - we felt that far outweighed any differences in effectiveness, which other studies have shown to be negligible. Heart damage from ACT is permanent and untreatable. I'll have 6 TC treatments every 3 weeks. If your MO is good, then if they give you a choice there is no wrong answer.",
