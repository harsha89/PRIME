Her tumor went from the size of a quarter to a baseball(8.5cm) in 6wks they removed 6 lymph nodes also from under her arm. March 29 we found out all 6 lymph nodes were positive for cancer...so the Oncologist ordered her to get a BRAC test, PET and Bone Scan. On April 11 we will get all those results and she also starts chemo that day. 6 months of chemo and 3 months of radiation. She is now diagnosed with Stage 3 Triple Negative Cancer. He told her she will lose her hair after her 2nd treatment of chemo. ) ': I don't know what to feel, how to act around her, I'm confused, overwhelmed, angry and I cry daily. People always say, \"you have to be strong for your sister...she needs you right now...\" Yes i know this, but if I'm not strong right now and not coping with this myself how will I be able to help her??? I feel like I'm in denial...I don't want to believe this is happening. xoxoxoxo Log in to post a reply",
