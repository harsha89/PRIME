Instead I sat in the shower pretending to wash....for a half hour. I have no hair, nor reason to shave, but with the water running no one is any the wiser. Sorry, having a day when everyone felt the need to hug me and tell me how great I am. I feel bald, fat, ugly, and stupid. Otherwise I promise I love life!",

Thus far everything has been going well except for mouth sores, but now that I suck on ice chips during my chemo sessions (cryotherapy) I haven't had a problem. It is such a roller coaster ride of emotions. I am lucky enough to not have to work, I had vacation time built up (some vacation). However, as a nurse working 12 hour night shifts, I don't think I could have make it. If I had a job where I could leave if I was feeling sick (rather than waiting for the next shift to come in) I would have been OK. The fatigue just overwhelms me at times. Other than that, however, the chemo has not been as bad as I expected. Once I was through the complete emotional breakdown of hair loss, that is. I know we will all get there and be stronger (though if anyone else tells me how \"strong\" I am I am going to scream). I still have surgery ahead as well for an implant in my right breast, which scares me to no end. But anything will be better than this ugly spacer.",
