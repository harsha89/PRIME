Have you been to your doctor for a complete physical?  It is more likely than not it is something other than breast cancer causing your problems.  And the doctors are not finding anything alarming on the ultrasound. Good luck, and I hope you get to the bottom of this soon.  Let us know how things turn out, please. ",

Mine was ER-, PR-, HER2+, like yours. And, it was my second go around, too, having DCIS in 2012. I did have lots of side effects, but none were unmanageable or debilitating. The fatigue has hung on with me the longest, but I am told I need to get way more active to see an improvement in that. So, maybe having a vegetable garden, full of organic tomatoes, peppers and other beautiful things will help me to get out there and do something. They told me to use a kid's toothpaste, since the adult stuff burned my tongue. I usually sipped on ice water or iced juice during treatment, so maybe that's why I didn't get mouth sores. The infusion nurses told me that Perjeta and Herceptin were a great combination. It shrunk mine over 90% before surgery. Good luck to you",
