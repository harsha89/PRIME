However I never thought of preventative surgery until I had an actual diagnosis of high grade LCIS at age 48.  This is not considered cancer and my doctors were not sure I was right to request bilateral mastectomy.  But I wanted it and we did it.  I am very, very happy this way. In your shoes I don't think I would do it yet.  I would wait and see if anything at all abnormal comes of it.  Maybe at the first sign of trouble you can take action?  Frankly, you may never get cancer.  You may just have lumpy tedious breasts until you are post menopausal, which means, yes you have some years ahead of you for testing, etc. Most mastectomy patients do ok.  Some have significant trouble with pain, range of motion, numbness, lymphedema.  However, the majority seem to do ok.  It's a big deal of a surgery though.  Things can go wrong and each woman is different.  I would hold off, if it were me, til I got some warning of trouble.  Are your breasts considered \"dense\"?  Can you stand to afford MRI (cause your insurance probably won't pay) to keep a high level of surveillance?  Have you talked about the idea of taking Tamoxifen even though you don't have a cancer diagnosis?  (you can't take it if pregnant though, I think)",

Your mammo is rating a BIRADS 0.  That means \"incomplete\".  It means they don't have enuf information on that mammo to make a full statement about the findings.  The ultrasound is rating BIRADS 4, meaning, suspicious, biopsy indicated.  That is not the worst it can be.  The worst is BIRADS 5, where they are just almost totally sure it is cancer.  For what it's worth, I had numerous films giving BIRADS 4 and the subsequent biopsies never found cancer.  So BIRADS 4 is not meaning you have cancer. It's just a rough time for you right now and I am sure others will give more info.  Meanwhile, do anything you can to reduce your stress and DO NOT google all this stuff or you will go insane.  No joke!!

If MRI shows something, they will core biopsy it.  I would get the MRI sooner rather than later.  Yes, there are false positives, but you have a variety of symptoms that warrant a closer look.  Good luck and let us know what your final path looks like on the FNA. edited to add:  you are in a great hospital.  Be assured that if your FNA has even a whiff of something unusual about it, the path report will come back with a recommendation to take more tisse for submission and they will then do so. ",

Grade one is a good thing and you tumor is not very large, also good. I have read that survival is unaffected whether you take lumpectomy or mastectomy. Which breast is it on? Some worry about heart issues from radiation if it's the left side. So if you already have heart trouble, that could be a factor. for some people age is a factor, as often cancer is more aggressive in younger women, so if you re younger, you can consider that too. Also, if you have a strong family history that might make you nervous about recurrence, it is something to consider. You are fortunate to have a variety of treatment options and it is good to hear you like your doctor. Good thing as you two could be hanging out together for awhile!",

You can always elect more surgery in the future should other data present itself. One thing I forgot to add: breast density. If you have dense breasts it can be a risk as the cancer is harder to see and the dense tissue is more prone to cancer than less dense. So ask your radiologist if you have dense ones. Probably not enuf to change anything, but a good piece of info for you to have.",

She had 18 nodes out as they had not invented sentinel node biopsy. All nodes were clean, but she became metastatic anyway, not a huge surprise considering the large cancer.

One of the biggest differences in AJs case would be that most likely (and I don't know for sure which way she went) she would not have a sentinel node biopsy.  Just this alone makes the recovery vastly easier and faster and the long run side effects profile (cording, lymphedema) much less likely.  If you have invasive cancer, sentinel node biopsy is a necessity.  If you have a cancer nearby the nipple, you cannot do nipple sparing like AJ did.  However, it is somewhat controversial to do nipple sparing on a BRCA+ case.  AJ is taking a small (and I am sure highly calculated) risk on that.  Leaving the nipple does allow a small amount of breast tissue cells to stay on the nipple.  The recurrence data on this is probably very new and constantly changing. I met with the women from FORCE in my area.  They are all BRCA+ and all have bilaterals.  Some were prophy, some were to treat cancer.  None had nipple sparing surgery.  However that was in 2009 and things are always changing.  At that time the highest level of risk reduction included removal of the nipple/aureola complex. There are plenty of women on these boards who had invasive cancer and did do nipple and skin sparing MX, so it is totally possible depending on your unique case.",

If you do have medical issues that mitigate the use of radiation, you doctor may have other suggestions.  There is a lot of new research in this area and the trend is to less treatment, not more.  So maybe there are some good options if you want to avoid radiation.  It may also depend on the aggressiveness of the cancer cells you have.  There is a poster on these forums:  \"Beesie\" who is totally expert on DCIS.  Recommend you search for her posts or even PM.  Hope the best for you (((hugs)))  ",

Agree that if she is going to tell us about her cancer and how she found it, it would be helpful for an explanation surrounding the treatment, which in this case is very significant and not usually the standard of care for early stage cancer.

As for the core biopsy, it's no big deal. I've had quite few of them (sigh) and the lidocaine works well and it won't hurt much. Just stay relaxed and still and it'll be over quick. I much doubt they are doing a sentinel node biopsy along with the core biopsy. If they proposed such a thing to me I would turn it down flat. SNB is a pretty involved procedure requiring a radioactive tracer injected into the breast nearby the known cancerous tumor. They then watch this tracer dye enter the first lymph nodes out of the breast and identify that as the \"sentinel\" node and remove it (usually several). Anyhow, this is a surgical procedure and is best done along with either lumpectomy or mastectomy, which ever is being done. It is not done in the context of core biopsy. They may see an enlarged node on the films and want to do a fine needle aspiration of that one with your corer biopsy. That is reasonable. Frequently FNA is inconclusive, but maybe this is what they have in mind. Check on this before you undergo the procedure.",

If you do have cancer, you will need lumpectomy or MX and that surgery is the right time to do sentinel node surgery. If your sentinel node is positive, and your tumor is over a certain size, it is normal for them to remove more nodes during the same surgery (called auxiliary node dissection) to appropriately stage the cancer. That is a even more involved procedure. So there is little gained from doing sentinel node surgery at a core biopsy procedure and then turning you around for a second surgery to do the lumpectomy or MX. Another reason is that, if on the lucky chance this thing is not cancer, and they do a sentinel bx which would have been completely unwarranted, you will have the subsequent lifetime risk of lymphedema in that arm and there will have been no reaason for you to have had the nodes out to start with. Sentinel node biopsy is only called for as part of the surgical removal of a biopsy proven cancer, as far as I have ever heard. Who is doing all this to you? Core biopsies are done by radiologists almost all the time. sentinel node biopsies are never done by radiologists, they are done by breast surgeons. So depending on who is seeing you, that will give you an idea.",

However, what is good is that they are referring you to a comprehensive cancer center and that means they have a very  high degree of skill and ability and can get to the bottom of your issue with speed and accuracy.  Remember these people see cancer every single day of their lives and they are used to it and sometimes forget that we who have never dealt with any of this, and don't know if we have cancer, are very highly sensitive to every word, tone or sideways look. You could ask your place who did your original mammo what the BIRADS score is on it.  BIRADS give a very approximate summary of what they think they see and how much they think it's cancer.    Hang in there.",

At the moment, you don't have much to worry about as it seems like they don't know either way.  Since it sounds like your breasts are a bit \"busy\" don't be surprised if they want to biopsy that area.  MRI will see it, for sure, and the washout kinetics (the rate the dye goes in and out of the lesion) will guide their evaluation.  Once the MRI sees something, it's kind of a slam dunk that you get biopsy as it becomes a medical/legal thing.  They are on the hook if they don't biopsy and it turns out they should have.

I suggest you get a consult with the radiologist who read your films and find out why the MRI is needed. At age 40 your breasts are probably dense, but that is not generally enuf to warrant MRI. Your insurance has to pre approve it, MRI is not standard treatment unless there is a high risk situation or a known abnormality and is expensive.

A bit confused about  your diagnosis.  There is no such thing as invasive DCIS.  The name for dcis is \"Ductal Carcinoma In Situ.\"  The \"in situ\" means it has not invaded the nearby breast tissue, but is staying inside the lining of the duct. If they find cancer outside of the duct, that would be considered invasive.  Maybe list the details of your path report and people can help you on that.  Your signature says 0/36 nodes removed.  Did you have nodes removed from your arm?  That would be more than expected for a dcis situation.  Is that just on one side or both? As for your recovery, I am 3 years out from bilateral MX.  I am perfectly fine and no problems and it's great!  i do use breast forms, all different types, depending on what I want them for.  Day to day I use the microbead forms from TLC and they are super lightweight (like nothing) and comfortable.  For sports I use foam ones and when I feel like looking quite chesty I use traditional silicone ones.  Overall, my figure is better than before i enjoy being able to switch up the look. It may take 6-8 weeks before you feel even slightly comfortable wearing breast forms and bras.  This is normal.  Just follow how you are feeling and listen to your body.  As times goes by you will be good as new.  Don't try and wear any tight bras and also, when you meet with the fitters for mx bras and forms, be firm about what you  want.  They tried to give me such tight things and I hated them.  I acutally use regular off the shelf bras and add my own sewing to hold a breast form.  I wear a victoria's secret bikini for swimming - those VS people know what they are doing :) Take it slow and easy and you'll be fine.",

He told me that they very, very rarely see lymphedema after MX where there are no auxillary nodes removed.  Lymphema risk rises if any nodes are removed, but more risk is conferred if more than 5 nodes are removed.  There are nodes inside the breast itself, which will be removed no matter what.  Apparently these do not much increase risk of lymphedema.  However, there are women on this board who had lymphedema even with no sentinel nodes out so the risk is not zero. I asked my radiologist and she said in 15 years she had not seen a woman have lymphedema with MX where they did no sentinel node BX.  I also asked my own surgeon what his clinical experience is and he told me he \"just doesn't see\" lymphedema after MX where he didn't take aux nodes or sentinel nodes.  So I went and did it, no nodes.  Two years later, so far so good.",

Based on the fact that they did not identify the lesion a year ago, I would have some loss of confidence in this particular healthcare provider.  So, when your pathology is back, definitely get a second opinion on it.  Plus, if they want an MRI, really research where you would want your treatment to be if it proves to be cancer and have your MRI done at that place. This is because often MRI software is different between providers, technique is different, a lot of things.  You want all your future work done at the very best place you can find. Hope everything turns out ok, but even if there is something wrong, you will recover and you have a lot of support from the great people here.",

Your trouble right now sounds like post traumatic stress and you need some help from a counselor who specializes in people facing serious illness.  You also should consider taking some anti anxiety meds so you can get some rest and prevent becoming sick in some other fashion, such as flu, etc which could arise from being ill rested and stressed out.  As you put time between yourself and your diagnosis you will feel better and better.",

I can be two totally different ways: very flat, or a curvy figure. I feel self conscious about going from one state to the next. this is probably why I do not like the idea of changing rooms, hot tubs etc. Most people do not know anything ever happened to my boobs, or they have an idea that something happened, years ago, not sure what, not important now.... So there is a huge difference in my appearance in some situations and that is probably the biggest issue. It is interesting how our emotions can change and move to new areas, recede and come back, like the ocean. I think it is probably normal. It is super to have this forum for a \"check in\" - to see how others are doing, to discuss changes and emotions. Thank you for your comments. Much appreciated!",

If so, the core samples have found DCIS.  DCIS is not an invasive type of cancer, as you know.  However since there is cancer in the nodes, it is clear there is an invasive component, which in all likelihood did not get taken up by the core needle. It is not unusual to find a bunch of different things in a breast and tumors can be mixed, containing DCIS plus other abnormal things, including invasive cancers. In this case the word \"metastasized\" means it has metastasized to the lymph nodes, but not necessarily to the body as a whole.  It is a fearful thing to see that word, but in your case they really do not know if you have systemic mets.  This is why they will do the CT, PET, etc, so they can get a full picture of what is going on.  Some doctors use that word to describe a cancer that has gone into the lymph nodes from it's orignal source.  I think it sounds really scary and wish they did not say it that way.  Finding \"mets to the nodes\" is not the same thing as mets to the body.  Many women have postive nodes and survive completely.  If positive nodes are found it is the correct protocol to do the various scans that your doctors are recommending, so they are doing the right thing and it does not mean they think they will definitely find anything.  It's just the next step that is correct to take to give you the  best treatment plan. I know you are so scared and it's been the worst time.  Don't be afraid to seek some counseling or ask for some medication to reduce your anxiety.  Just take things day to day or hour by hour if necessary.  We have all been there, right in your shoes, where sometimes it's all about just getting from one moment to the next.  ALSO don't rely on the stats you see on the net because they are old, outdated and not useful.  Treaments have changed and continue to change so fast that the survival stats are not up to date on the net. ",

By the time we went for the mastectomy surgery we had high confidence that no invasive would be found. My onc and I worked up a plan on what we'd do if it was found. All this was a bit more than most people would get, but my insurance went along with it luckily. We did the MX, no invasive found, no sentinel node taken and my recovery was as complete as it could be. When I go see my BS at Stanford, he usually has a student or 2 with him and he says in one short sentence what we did. I usually take them aside and fully explain how great this was and what it saved me, as those students cannot grasp it right away. It's a bit of a gamble, but since sentinel node does not extend survival in any case, only stages it the risk is not crazy considering the workup beforehand. I'd do it again just like that without reservation.",

I told Rockson my family history and he said they don't have data to prove genetics, but the history was certainly more positive than negative for me regarding LE. In the end we all have to take our own paths.  It does seem there is not enough research for us to be 100% sure of anything.  However, it also seems that LE with the profile I posted is considered rare. ",

If you can get them to delay the sentinel node until after they establish if your cancer has any invasive component, that would be very good. The sentinel node surgery does not establish if you have dcis or not, what it does is establish (not perfectly) if an invasive cancer has a systemic involvement. Also, I might want that genetics consult before surgery, as if you do find a brca+ mutation that would probably change the type of surgery you will have.

I was scared of the procedure, scared that I even needed the procedure and very concerned about the results. Bad time! Here is the deal: the procedure is ok. Tough part is lying in a fixed position for a while as they do the work. Here's some advice - wear a front closing bra and a button up shirt. These are much easier to put on afterwards. Bring some warm fluffy socks and wear these instead of your shoes for lying on the table. If you have long hair, put it in a scrunchy so it won't annoy you while lying there. If you feel panic, ask for a Valium. It's not unusual for them to give these for the test. Have some extra ice packs at home, you want these for the whole day, off and on. Stock your hou with stuff you like, chocolate, ice cream, whatever makes you happy, as a reward for getting thru. Honest it's not as bad as all that. Mine did not hurt at all.

I get it about MRI opening a can of worms.  It often does.  However it will give you the best view of everything going on in your breast.  Often the protocol for LCIS is tamoxifen plus high surveillance.  This surveillance often includes a mammogram followed by six month interval to MRI, rinse, repeat.  If your breasts are quite dense, MRI really is important to find early cancer. I did take all my slides to a major cancer center and happily they agreed with the first reading. ",

My sister had a hair loss condition and started using wigs, which got me into it somewhat, even though I have enuf natural hair.  Wigs can actually be very fun.  With chemo the scalp can be really sensitive so consider a wig cap/liner to help reduce friction on your scalp. ",

I have not had this happen, but have too much experience in this area, so here are some thoughts: When you first walked in the treatment room, the images on the computer were from your mammogram. There is a slim chance they were not your films. I always made sure both my name and date of birth were correct on the screens. I was surprised when I saw how many names there were so close to my own. (I know one should never see these, but sometimes you do). So have someone check it closely. The posture on the table is obviously much different from posture for the mammo, so potentially if you have very dense breasts the calcs could have shifted under some tissue and been hard to see. Other thing, a very long shot, is that you have milk of calcium, a b9 condition and the calcs moved around from the posture shift on the table. This seems unlikely as it should be easy to tell you had milk of calcium and therefore you would not need biopsy. So, let us know what your doc says - it's weird that this happened!",

I cannot imagine doing a rowing machine a week after surgery, so that is something to say, right there.  I was very weak and pretty pathetic for some time.  I could take walks but I dared not pick up a weight. I am two years out and do everything plus more that I ever did.  I ride horses, carry their heavy tack around and they pull on me a lot - no problem.  Give yourself the time you need.  Your body has never experienced what you just went thru and that's why it doesn't just spring back automatically.  But it will.  Sounds like you were in excellent shape going into bc and that is a great thing.  You'll be back in form soon enuf!",

If I were you, I would relax as much as you can, take the test and see what it says before mentioning it to your bf. Truely, it's a lot of info for a young guy and I would wait til I had a definitive answer from the test results. The main number one thing is your own health. My mom also died of bc and I had a negative brca result. Most women who get cancer are negative. the great thing is that knowledge is power and either result will give you information to take the best care of yourself. Hope everything goes the best for you!",
