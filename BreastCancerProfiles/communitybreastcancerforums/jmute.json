I'm just wondering if when we get the full pathology report do you add up the size of the 2 tumors or would 1 tumor be this stage and another be another stage?

Inside that lump were 2 spots of IDC, one was 4mm and the other was 7 mm. The MO said she stages off of the largest spot, which was 7mm. She said the difference between 1a and 1b was the tumor was larger than 5mm. Now I've read countless hours about breast cancer and have never come across the 5mm dividing line. We're very happy with the care and center we've picked, Ohio state University breast cancer center, it's one of the best in our area behind the cleveland clinic. Weve got no desire to switch but this staging confused us. My 2nd question is has anyone had a high oncotype score when they were grade 1 with a 1 mitotic score? Hoping we can skip the chemo.
