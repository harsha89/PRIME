I've read a number of things about side effects from rads causing heart damage that's making me lean toward a mastectomy. I'm wondering if anyone else is weighing heart issues as a concern as well?",

Maybe ask your MO. I stumbled on a wonderful site to check the safety levels of health and cosmetic products. They are definitely trying to sell their own products but they rate thousands of commercial brands and tell you which alternatives are better. http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/ They don't have a lot of the smaller brands but lots of stuff I use or should say used is rated.",

Too many chemicals.So the Herbatint does a nice job and there are a lot of colors. It lasts about 2 months without fading and it still looks good. Havent recolored since November. My brows are shot. I used to have spectacular brows but they thinned so much I have to pencil them in to make it look like I have any. I'm 6 mos PFC and not much has grown back yet but I'm still on Herceptin through March so that may have something to do with it.",

What a difference a year makes. Don't despair you will have hair!! (BTW, my hair used to be stick straight. Getting used to being a curly girl. Totally different rules.)",

Tomorrow morning is the MRI so I'm moving right along. I appreciate the comments about it being a marathon. I tend to be a sprinter and want to get things done and over with. This will be a challenge for the impatient part of me. I'll check in with further info as it comes. In the meantime, I'm heading off to search for info on Herceptin and Perjeta and what to expect. I'm a little concerned since I read something somewhere about side effects include heart problems. I have a pretty intense arythmia that's managed with a betablocker (the fun never ends!) so I'm hoping that wont interfere.... Hugs to all of you.",
