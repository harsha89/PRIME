I was very young when I had her. My mom took over and over rode each decision I made. I didnt feel I was allowed to be a mom until I had my second at age 24. My other children didn't spend nearly as much time with my mom. My mom has dementia now. My daughter must be feeling that loss since my moms personality changed and she was no longer able to care for herself. Also we live far away but she has my husbands mom, sister, brother niece and friends.also they say she looks well.",
