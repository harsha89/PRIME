They \"wake up\" very quickly when I shake my hand, but are tingly. I only had sentinel node biopsies (5 from right, 1 from left), but I'm not even sure if that would cause this. I'm six weeks from surgery and feeling a lot better the last few days. Has anyone else experienced this? I'm worried it may be a sign of, or cause lymphedema. Diagnosed at 25.... Still seems surreal!

I was in constant pain for six weeks after my surgery, but I swear it does get better! I'm fine now with just Advil. What muscle relaxer did your doctor put you on? I tried Skelaxin, Valium, and Flexeril but only the Flexeril gave me ANY relief. However, Skelaxin is my PS's preferred drug and the one she prescribes every patient first because it has the least drowsy/loopy effects. It didn't work for me, but maybe it would for you! I made sure my TE fill appointments were either right before or right after the scheduled time to take my pain reliever and muscle relaxer. Except the one time I didn't.... I regretted it immensely. That was also the time I asked for 100cc fills instead of the usual 60cc. I was in excruciating pain for days and I'm sure it set my recovery back. Now I'm finished with fills and just looking forward to my exchange surgery in December! It's still tight and uncomfortable, but at least we have an end in sight :",
