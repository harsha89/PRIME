My doctor found a small lump and an elongated \"ridge\" next to the lump back in November. Immediately was sent for a mammogram and ultrasound. Both came back negative. My doctor still wanted me to see a breast surgeon. After meeting with him, it was decided to go ahead with a surgical biopsy which was done last Tuesday. Now the wait is on. Will not know any thing until next Thursday (over two weeks of waiting...) At first I thought that doing the biopsy was overkill as both my mammogram and ultrasound were negative. However, the surgeon told me that the mass was definitely solid and in order to know for sure what we were dealing with, he recommended the biopsy \"to be on the safe side.\" He is quite certain it's fine, but wouldn't know for sure without the biopsy. I am 42 years old and there is no history of breast cancer in my family. However as I have read through these forums, I realize that many women who have breast cancer have no family history.  I have also read on other forums on this web site that even though mammograms and ultrasounds are negative, it is wise to follow up with biopsy if questions remain. I do have a question though. Since the biopsy last week, I am experiencing significant pain in my breast. Of course I expected pain after the biopsy, but, as time passes, the pain seems to be increasing, not decreasing. At first it was a throbbing pain going in under my arm, down my arm and up my neck with welt-like raised skin extending from one end of the excision towards my breast bone. It also felt like my neck was swollen. Now in the past two days it has turned into a burning-type sensation to the point that it hurts at times to have clothes against my breast. Went to emergency as I was sure I had an infection-nothing was found. For those who have had surgical biopsies, have you experienced this type of issue? I was under the impression from the surgeon that the pain wouldn't be like this. My incision was just under two inches. I have a call into the surgeon again to discuss this. My thoughts are with both of you....good luck and take good care of yourselves. I wish you all the best....",

I spoke with the nurse at my surgeon's office this morning and based on what I've told her, she doesn't suspect an infection. She said that an individual's recovery time/pain from the biopsy can differ dramatically depending on the location/size of the incision, the extent of the biopsy etc. I am happy to say that I am noticing less pain today and my breast looks better than earlier this week, so that's good. Perhaps I am on the mend. Good idea on the cold compress. I wasn't told to use them on my incision, but I may just try that tonight when I get home from work. Please let us know how things go...Take care of yourself.",
