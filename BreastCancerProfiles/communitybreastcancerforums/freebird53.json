I have been doing really well for about 3 mths..when I got that late 6pm call from OC say that my tm sky rocketed from 300 to 800 ..Question to you ladies..how low has any of you gone with tm and were doing well ...So CAT scan scheduled for next Friday...just made my OC a little curious..due to the fact I have been feeling and doing so well gaining weight ect. So of course I go through a Emotional/Mental breakdown for 24 hrs...say gee louise what the Freak now...Been able to go to functions/camping/enjoying life the last 3 mths...and then BANG!!!!! It gets all shot down...DAMN IT!! So I'm going on this weekend worry Question for you ladies...How are you all with drinking Alcohol...such as wine...My OC told be to enjoy a few glasses on weekends..I have not indulged...but some nights it would be nice to just enjoy some Pinot Grigio...glass or two...to just relax ..I been around others that have indulged with wine...who their OC has told them it would ok on a Occasional basis only...OPINIONS please. Just thought that Cancer Cells feed on sugar and that is any sugars am i right... Sitting here with my thoughts while i'm trying to figure out what I did or didn't due to have the tm go up..i'm just so sad It's like a roller coaster 3 mths well ...now probably 3 mths down..up down up down..enough all ready please...

Sarah: I wasn't given chemo (red demon) this last week due to my counts but was given my normal mthly Faslodex bone booster shot...forgot the name of it..so my se effects with the pain have been for a couple weeks...and so did my OC say that it's inflamed..I had rads alot in my right hip area...the sapped around that area so probably why I get the pain...but once i take my meds...i'm good during the day... I bound out of chemo...last week too because I have a friend that is coming in from Oregon to visit...so i didn't want to be ill..I'll take the treatment again on Tuesday... A another note...had a panic knock at my door last nite. it was my youngest daughter..i just had a feeling...her hubby got them a room for the nite downtown for a romantic dinner and drinking...so they could have a break from the kids...and it sure didn't turn out...i just felt it wasn't...they got into a fight where she was intoxicated and he wanted to leave and she wanted one more and that was it...he got in in car and she tried to stop him and ended up using her fists on the car window to get in she looked a mess...OMG...I can't leave this earth knowing that she has a issues with alcohol...she comes from 2 parents that were addicts...but have been clean for 20 yrs plus...but she told me so much about there relationship...it saddens me...especially telling her he will take the boys away... She has known him since high school...a long history...they were to young to have children especially 2 so close in age...God bless those boys...it's not there faults... She would not be able to survive without me here and not be with her hubby...he's the world to her...I am really scared what would she do if that relationship would end... I never believed in Happy Valentines Day....I never had one...now it's going that way with my daughter...I don't want this for her...But what can I do....L&R Carla",

So I am Home after being in the hospital for 6 days...I was enduring sever pain that woke me up out of a deep sleep 6 days ago..I't was located in my left leg,femur,groan area. I could not walk just tremendous pain. I texted my Doctor at 2am in the morning and he responded to take a double dose of my pain meds and he would arrange to admit me to the hospital the next day. Which was the 9th..I was given a CAT scan and the results returned with a massive tumors in my left hip,femur,and groan area...So my Doc told me that my Cancer is progressing rapidly and we needed to start radiation treatment ASAP and get me on an pain regiment for the pain...Family,friends..my cancer is in a progressive state as of today. I have to do radiation until the end of this mth...and also am on two oral chemo pills. I decided yesterday that I did not want to stay any longer in the hospital and told my doc that I wanted to go home and make my life back to normal. He ask me if I was interested in a Nursing Home...\"I send fuck no\" kinda of surprised him with that out burst (lol) I need to go back to my life...he said ok I'll get you released papers..The reason for not communicating on FB is 1) I was totally Doped up. Witnesses Stacy Heath and Krista M Mitchell 2) I was not ready to release info until I notified my family. 3) I was not emotionally ready to talk about me being in a progressive stage in my disease that means my life has shorten. I probably will be not on here much because I need to focus on coming to some kind of understanding of what and is going to be the end of my life. I am scared to death and I have not come to terms with that part of my life, departing from my children...grand boys and family members...and all my dearest dearest friends i have made in my life. I have to come to terms with what God has plans for me now and understand and except this decision he as made to take me to his home. I love and cherish my family...friends...with all the love I have in my being...I need everyone of you to try to come and see me personally more now then ever. Please give me and my family a little break for a short while...not forever to get adjusted to this big change in our lives...I will promise to keep in touch when I'm feeling well enough to get on FB and Text Folks. Just please keep my children and grand kids and myself in your prayers...and I LOVE YOU ALL...PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS TELL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THAT YOU LOVE THEM DAILY...BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW WHEN SOMETHING CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THOSE YOU LOVE. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS!!",
