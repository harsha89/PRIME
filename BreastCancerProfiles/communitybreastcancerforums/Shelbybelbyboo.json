    "Content": "Shelbybelbyboo wrote: Good evening all, As I am waiting for more tests after a BIRADS 0 score I went and retrieved all my reports from the last year of images, biopsies, and pathology reports. I looked over my one pathology report and although benign I wondered what the B4 meant on the bottom of the surgical pathology report. When I had a biopsy of a different area and was diagnosed with RS the biopsy read a B3. I tried looking up some literature on this topic and all I found was B3 meant a lesion of uncertain potential or \"borderline\" lesion but i could not find much on a B4. It also stated that B2 meant benign normal tissue and B5 meant malignant. Can anyone help to clarify this? Log in to post a reply",
