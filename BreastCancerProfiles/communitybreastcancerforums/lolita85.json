I was dignosed on 2009, on my birthday...I had neoadyu chemo, masectomy, more chemo (grgr) and radio. In August I finished my treatment and started with tamoxifen and leupro (an inyection per month). So far I feel great, I'm working in a cruise ship, travelling the world. Now I'm on vacations, and went to visit my doc. This Tuesday I have my mammo and I'm super nervous !  The doctor touched my breast, the common thing and asked me things like: does it hurts? Etc...I said no....so he said that everything seems good. That's why I only have the mammo, but as soon as I left the hospital, EVERYTHING started to hurt.  Anybody felt like this before? I know is just my mind, but I need ppl who understand me. I am eating like a pig, because I'm soooo anxious!!!!!!!!  :-))))))  Carla Dx 11/23/2009, ILC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, 7/18 nodes, ER+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
