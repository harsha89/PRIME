Mostly nausea (even with all the meds), dizziness, and headache. Now WBC is way low again (back on antibiotics) and they are still telling me to stay out of public places. I've had to do all my Christmas shopping online this year. Regarding surgery, my lumpectomy and SNB was October 11. Most of the feeling has returned under my arm, but I only had one node removed. My lumpectomy site still has soreness, especially my nipple, but I did have an infection there a couple weeks ago. Up until they put me on antibiotics for that, I had a hard lump. It is almost gone now. Hair -- I shaved mine last Wednesday. It was starting to shed pretty badly and my head was very tender. The tenderness went away after I shaved it. I have a bit of a stubble now, though.  For those starting radiation or chemo, check to see if there is a local Look Good Feel Better class you can go to. It is sponsored by the American Cancer Society. They will teach you makeup tips (like creating eyebrows), skin care, and tying scarfs. They give you a kit full of makeup. Take advantage of it if you can.",

Mgdsmc, I hear you on chemo. It's rough, yes, but cancer is the enemy. Chemo gives us a fighting chance. We can just hope that one day there will be something easier.

One of the main characters is going through breast cancer. Tuesday night's episode was about her shaving her head and her husband making the mistake of going and buying a wig for her.

Also they told me starting the next morning when I got up to start taking the Zofran pill (4mg) along with a steroid, Dexamethasone (4mg) every 8 hours for a couple days. They also gave me promethazine (25mg) to take for breakthrough nausea. I took it several times. It made me sleep but didn't really help with the nausea. I know part of it is I'm having a hard time drinking while I am nauseated. I try to mostly drink water but it also seems to tate bad for a few days. Maybe I should try to Ensure or Carnation breakfast. I seem to be able to tolerate nuts and peanut butter crackers.  I am starting to feel bad by the time I leave from chemo. I got to thinking that I've always had a hard time tolerating sugar. I am not diabetic, but have had hypoglycemia in the past. Too much sugar gives me headache, dizziness,  nausea. They are pumping glucose into me during the treatment, so I'm wondering if that might be part of what is starting the issue.",

I would prefer to just wear wear a comfy tobagan with a pretty scarf wrapped around it. But am I going to make people uncomfortable or will they think I'm playing the sympathy card or trying to get attention? We have a small office though and mostly ladies, so I think they would be fine with it. However, we do have visitors coming from our corporate office on Monday, so I guess it might be more appropriate to wear a wig (in other words, I'll probably chicken out and wear the wig).

Look up HER2 positive in the site search box and you will find information specific to that. As others have said there are targeted therapies that have been developed for HER2+. You will get chemo and  followup therapy that is targeted toward your specific diagnosis. Ask your MO specifically how he treats triple positive differently from HR+, PR+, HER2-. I am triple negative, so that is a question I asked about mine.  I start my chemo tomorrow. Port site is still a bit sore, but hopefully needle stick won't be too bad.

They have told me my health is the most important thing and to not try to rush things. Also, I can work from home, so that will help. Unfortunately, the week after my lumpectomy, I lost one of my key employees and now have to start going through interview process. Our HR manager will help, but final interviews and decision will come down to me. Have a Sunday, Ladies. ",
