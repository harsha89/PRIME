    "Content": "Aug 1, 2017 10:48AM - edited Aug 1, 2017 10:53AM by afball25 I am starting chemo 8/16, and am going cross eyed from all this info...I just want someone to send me a chemo starter pack or something...\"Dummys guide to chemo side effects\"...something to somehow clear up all this mess in my mind...I am going for some shorter hair cut this weekend, and then going out of town the weekend before chemo...I feel like I am going to have a lot of time to develop cabin fever over the next four months... My port goes in the day before my first infusion, and I feel like it's not going to be super comfy...too bad I cant fast forward through December",
