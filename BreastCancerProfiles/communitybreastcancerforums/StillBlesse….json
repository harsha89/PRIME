I have the problem that some of my hair came back; however, it did not in the top and crown. I was not told that taxotere could cause permanent hair loss. I know there are other things worse than not having hair, but at least I wishI'd have known there was a risk of permanent hair loss",

In any event, I had a bilateral mastectomy with diep flap reconstruction on 3/14/17. I returned to work 9 weeks later and over the past 5 weeks I have become increasingly fatigued. I finished PT last week and have no energy to do anything. Anyone else going through this? Also, I am scheduled for Stage 2 reconstruction on 8/9. Anyone else scheduled for Stage 2?",
