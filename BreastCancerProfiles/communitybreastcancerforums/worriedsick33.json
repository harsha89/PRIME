    "Content": "worriedsick33 wrote: Hi there,   I have been lurking for a few days but thought I would share my story if that is okay.  I'm 33 years old.  Healthy, run and exercise regularly.  Just did a marathon last year.  I have two young children ages 6 and 2.  Breast fed  the 1st one for 20 months and the 2nd one for 26 months.  I have always had \"lumpy\" breasts.  When I was 21 I had a lump removed from my left breast.  I can't even remember what it was.  Just something very small and smooth.   About a year ago during my annual exam the dr. felt a lump but again I was breast feeding at the time and I didn't think anything of it.  I had mastitis a few times during both children.  More with the 2nd one.  Well I stopped breast feeding my littlest one in mid- late June just before DH and I went out of town.   On Tuesday I noticed a large mass on my right breast (same area I believe my dr. noticed last year).  Its at 12:00 from the nipple up.  about 3cm.  Hard and irregular shape.  At first I thought it was just breast tissue but I found it to be harder and different compared to my other breast.   I was seen on Wednesday by a physicians assistant and a medical student doing her rounds . I was examined by the med student who I felt did a good job.  She said she felt it.  Didn't say much other than \"its mobile\" that's good.  Then the P.A. did the exam and was very dry.  didn't say much.  measured it which I swear she said 3cm x 6cm.  And then gave me a referral for a breast surgeon for further exam.  Said it was kinda triangular shape (worried!!!).  Saw the surgeon on Friday afternoon.  She took a core biopsy.  She gave me a bunch of options such as referral for imagining but said she could tell I couldn't wait and was a nervous wreck so this would be the fastest way to get results (3 - 5 business days).  She didn't rule out cancer if you know what I mean.  even said she treats patients who are young with breast cancer, etc... She said it didn't feel like a cyst.  Took 6 samples for the core biopsy.  When I look at the outline she made with dots it is kinda a circle but not exactly. She said her top pick was a lacatating adenoma.  She said 5% chance it was cancer (but I keep wondering if she was just quoting over all statistics at my age?).  Now after the biopsy I keep trying to feel it making the area sore.   I got my period on Saturday so I'm wondering if it was related to that?  I can't stop worrying.  I am sick to my stomach. crying all the time.   I was never this worried when I was 21 and had a biopsy.  I felt like they ruled out cancer at that time.   Log in to post a reply",
