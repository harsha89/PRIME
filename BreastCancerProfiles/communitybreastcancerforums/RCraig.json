Does anyone know another reputable source for up to date numbers on survival statistics or have any idea why adjuvant is down? She's trying to make a life changing decision and it's so difficult without knowing the stats. Log in to post a reply",

When I went to the predict site it only shows a .5% difference in survival rate with the addition of Herceptin. The doctor keeps throwing numbers around like 20% increase survival rate with Herceptin so I don't know if the website is wrong or the doctor is just exaggerating. It's like there is so much info but none of it aligns.",
