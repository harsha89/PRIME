I am stage IIB and had 3 cancerous lymph nodes out of about 40 that were removed (one lymph node in my breast and 2 in my underarm. One lymph node was extracapular). I think my tumor was about 3 cm and they also found DCIS after lympectomy. The doctors refer to me as early stage breast cancer. Now, I know there are ladies that are a lot worse of then me, but how is this early? I feel like I caught it pretty late (thank g-d not too late though).",
