If a hair or the tip of my shirt touches in between my implants near the top.....it is MADDENING!! Like a cross between a tickle and pain. Also, I have a grape sized lump under my right armpit that hurts. My BS says it may be axial breast tissue (ultrasound showed it was not fluid filled) or got clumped somehow when the implant was attached. She said she wants me to finish healing before we address it. I had a skin/nipple sparing bilateral mastectomy. I was supposed to have tissue expanders because my left breast had been radiated 7 years prior but I woke up with implants. I am happy about that...and am very grateful.....I wasn't prepared for this burning. ALSO......I am having this thing.....if I scratch a mosquito bite on my wrist or leg or something similar......I get a sharp pain in my breast/s. Is this because the nerves are all messed up?? My fiance keeps telling me to take Tylenol but Tylenol doesn't touch this pain! It is not excruciating for me but it is very unpleasant and uncomfortable. I may try some of the creams mentioned in this thread! Thank you! Hugs for you all. <3",

Can't wait to find out the results this Monday or Tuesday......if benign then it is off to radiation for me!!! :D Keeping my fingers crossed! guineamom I hope biospy results are B-9!!!! <3 Very similar things happening with you and I......the mass they biopsied yesterday was indeed on the MRI........but the one I could actually feel was not on the MRI or found by US!! SO WEIRD!!! This is what my MRI said about the mass in my left breast: In the inferomedial aspect of the left breast at approximately 7-8 o'clock, there is a 10 x 6 mm, well circumscribed but mildly lobulated, mildly enhancing nodule which has predominately type 2 or plateau characteristics. This appears to have a small fatty notch and most likely is an intramammary lymph node but findings are overall indeterminate. I do not see any other areas of abnormal enhancement in the left breast. * most likely intramammary lymph node based on its morphology with type 2 enhancement kinetics. Recommendation will be for a second look ultrasound as this was not seen on the initial ultrasound and, if identified, ultrasound-guided core biopsy would be recommended to exclude malignancy, although favor that this is benign and most likely an intramammary lymph node.",

      "Content": "Dec 29, 2011 12:26AM - edited Dec 29, 2011 12:29AM by Druanne :( I am so very sorry :( I am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength, and I stand and watch her until at length she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come down to meet and mingle with each other. Then some one at my side says: \"There! she's gone!\" Gone where? Gone from my sight, that is all. She is just as large in the mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side, and just as able to bear her load of living freight to the place of her destination. Her diminished size is in me, and not in her. And just at that moment, when some one at my side says: \"There! she's gone!\" there are other eyes that are watching for her coming and other voices ready to take up the glad shout, \"There she comes!\" Do not stand at my grave and weep; I am not there. I do not sleep. I am a thousand winds that blow. I am the diamond glints on snow. I am the sunlight on ripened grain. I am the gentle autumn rain. When you... awaken in the morning's hush, I am the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds in circled flight. I am the soft stars that shine at night. Do not stand at my grave and cry; I am not there. I did not die.",
