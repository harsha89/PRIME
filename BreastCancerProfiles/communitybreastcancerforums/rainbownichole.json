    "Content": "rainbownichole wrote: Hi all, I spent the afternoon reading this board and have decided to tell my own story from the day. I noticed a lump about 2 months ago on my right breast, but because I am breastfeeding I just shrugged it off. My partner was concerned, and I promised to make an appointment. I am one year postpartum (March 25th my 2nd daughter turned 1!) and still breastfeeding. I'm 27. Today was my appointment and the provider did a breast exam and agreed she felt an \"irregular\", pea-sized lump. I'm scheduled for an ASAP ultrasound/diagnostic mammogram next Thursday.Â  My mother passed at the age of 49 from pancreatic, bile, and a third cancer of unknown origin...only 5 weeks after diagnosis. Needless to say, I am sick with worry. I know my age and breastfeeding status are working in my favor, but any advice would be helpful. I can't seem to stop thinking about this...
