    "Content": "flagstage3 wrote: Iwhat a year! i'm a single mom of twin 6 year olds, had them on my own so i really need to beat this!. I'm 46 and have stage 3 idc breast cancer. I finished radiation last week, still have chemo every 3 wks til May and reconstruction in the spring. I had a double mastectomy in sept. i was told they don't do follow up pet and bone scans or mris or cts, why is that???Â the one doc says stats show it doesnt really help that if the test is pos it's too late anyway, it would be stage 4! so how am i suppose to move on every day feeling like im not going to have a recurrence to stage 4 and die??? im a strong independent person, until cancer hit me! to top it off my bf ended our relationship 1 week before my surgery! i wanna live to see my girls grow up and get married, etc... i had 15 nodes taken on one side, 6 had cancer, and 2 removed on the other side that we not cancer. i know i have to pray they got everything in surgery and with the radiation but it seems like its just pot luck, i do go to a support group once a week but its a mix of scenarios including women dying with stage 4, women with recurrence, etc i leave there more depressed then when i walked in at times!
