My question is around what you did work-wise during chemo.  Did you stop working or were you able to work?  I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 20 month old, and I work 3 days a week.  I was thinking of stopping working during chemo and focusing on the kids  I really feel like if I have limited energy that I should focus it on them, but I really don't know how I will feel thru all of this.  What did you do?
