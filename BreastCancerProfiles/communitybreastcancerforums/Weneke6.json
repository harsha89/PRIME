Then I broke out and certain areas were sore and swollen. And itchy. I got folliculitis. I used hydrocortisone which made it worse. The whole time all i used was vaseline lotion 3 times day. The last week a used Eucerine and that was just sticky and I didn't really see a difference. Once I went back to the just the vaseline, the itchy stopped and it has been clearing up. I am red, but not blistered and the pain is from inside not outside and more of an ache then actual pain. I took alive one night and sleep on my side with my daughters heart shaped pillow under my arm and against my breast. I used dove deodorant and body wash everyday. I wore a tank top for bed and sports bra daily. No issues there. I walked 3 miles a day and dark a lot of water. One thing I figured out is if you keep going after treatment, you are fine. it's when you stop you get tired fast. Just glad to be done. Good luck and God bless.",

My breast get very sensitive from ovulation all the way until my period ends. My period has been weird for a couple of months. This one seems to lighter and dragging out. It start on the 16th. I am 42. Anyways, the last two weeks I have had the normal pain. But this one seems to have settled into only my left breast. All over spots. No real focal. My shoulder had ached as have sometimes taking a deep breath. The pain is not debilitating and the itch not persistent, more like a tickle every now and then. The pain more of a discomfort and ache. It might be slightly bigger then the other one but not noticeably. I heard everyone has bigger boob, I never noticed. No difference in texture, swollen, redness, lumps, discharge... I mentioned this to a friend she told me it sounded like BC. So we googled and came up with IBC. I called my doctor and they can't see me until Dec 28th. I am freaking out and already imagining my daughter without a mother. Not to mention every time I try and watch tv the cancer commercials are on these days. Is that a sign??? Any thoughts, ?
