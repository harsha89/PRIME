I feel much better than I did last week. I am gong to focus on the lower end of the percentages and pray that is where I fall. If not, we wil, face it head on and do what is necessary! Can't do anything about it at this point, so, just have faith that it is lower percentage and act after results are found. Thank you, again, for easing my fears !!! Happy New Year to all of you!!!! May 2012 bring blessing and good health to you all",
