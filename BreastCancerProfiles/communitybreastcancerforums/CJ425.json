      "Content": "CJ425 wrote: Two years ago I had an ultrasound guided biopsy and was diagnosed with invasive ductile carcinoma in my right breast. On 4/25/11 I had a simple mastectomy with one sentinel lymph node removed. Lymph nodes and all margins showed to be clear. After surgery I noticed that the skin at the biopsy site was still there. That bothered me because I remember reading somewhere that the skin at the biopsy site is removed during mastectomy. Mine was not. Some time passed and I noticed that the scar at my biopsy site felt a little bigger, but my doctors believed it was just scar tissue. As more time passed, it felt like the scar was growing still, and the site was starting to dent in. I had a mammogram and ultrasound which revealed a small mass at the original biopsy site area, in the scar tissue.  New biopsy of mass performed 4/5/13 is positive recurrence of invasive ductile carcinoma. Question for all you who had mastectomy: Was the skin and tissue of biopsy area removed? Thank you for your reply.

The recommended treatment this time is surgery to remove the tumor and remove my implant. Then chemo followed by radiation and then hormone therapy. It's going to be a long road ahead but I have a Great husband and family that will help get me through it.",
