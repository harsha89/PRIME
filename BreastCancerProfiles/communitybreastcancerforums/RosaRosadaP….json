I know I'm getting very nervous about my surgery on the 24th. Lots of things already going through my mind. Lots of sleepless nights and tossing and turning. I keep thinking this is a nightmare and that I will wake up eventually. But if any good can come from this, such as being able to help someone else, it will be worth it. I'm trying to keep a positive and open mind about this and other things that have happened. You take care, and thank you again.",

This is a terrible way for people to have to meet, but at the same time it's a blessing and an answer to prayer.  In this together!  RosaRosadaPinkRose",

Hope you ladies are all doing well, and best wishes to those who have upcoming surgeries. I am still trying to make some very needed adjustments and waiting for my Knitted Knockers to come in. I sure don't feel very good about myself, but in time, I know that I will learn to live with it. Last week was my first week back to work. It was a little difficult, but I got through it. I just want to say that as hard as the mastectomy was to have done, I am very grateful and blessed to be alive.",

You are a brave warrior yourself, as well as all of the other ladies here. I guess we could call ourselves the Warrior Sisters. Mine started out as a lumpectomy, and when tissue was sent to pathology, the results did not come back well. Therefore, I needed a mastectomy on the right side. I will be going to an oncologist Wednesday the 15th to see if any further treatment is needed. I'm hoping not as I don't want to put any unnecessary chemicals in my body. I have changed my eating habits drastically. I am now a vegetarian for the most part. God bless you too, kroop73. Take care. :)",

I already had a lumpectomy a couple of weeks ago, but when tissue had been sent to pathology, it showed the cancer to be more aggressive than originally thought. I will be having a mastectomy, the removal of my right breast on January 24. I would like to be added to your list. I am very scared at this point, but I think that's to be expected.",

It's hard to go through this, but nice to know I have a place to go for support. I have had a very rocky road during the past few years with other health issues before this. I almost bled to death in 2015 and had to have transfusions and needed an emergency hysterectomy. But before I could have that done, blood clots had formed in my leg. So from there I had to be put on blood thinners for the clot, then they had to implant an IVC fllter in me to help keep the clots away from my lungs and heart while they did the surgery. After a slow recovery from that, this breast cancer came about. I'm still on blood thinners so there are special preps that have to be done before my mastectomy on the 24th. I have got so much on my mind I am an emotional wreck, worrying about bills and other things. I know eventually things will work out. It's just hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel right now. Thank you for letting me vent. You are an awesome group of ladies. :)",
