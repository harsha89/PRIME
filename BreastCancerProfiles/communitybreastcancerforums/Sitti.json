Plantchild, I hope your surgeon was able to resolve the fever and it's origin and that you continue to heal. Your post-op update made me smile as you described your joke telling and praying. :) I was wondering what kind of reconstruction you had as well. Yvonne, yay for shampoos and clean hair! Sorry you have a cold on top of trying to heal. Amandab1234, lifeb4me, cdv4251992 - it's good to hear from you all and how your recoveries are doing. cdv4251992 I have read that on here alot too, about the fluid, I was told I had some fluid build up (after LX) but there was no sloshing (I think my breast is too little to slosh! lol) EastcoastTS, Jrow7, Goldie63, Wallan and anyone else I missed prayers for continued healing. GrendelDog & MariH, thinking of you, prayers for your surgeries today. I have a pre-op appt. with BS today. I have to admit, I don't usually get nervous about surgery but this one, well, the closer it gets I get a little more nervous but reading the posts from everyone is certainly encouraging and helpful. We can do this. Each and everyone of you, named or not, are amazing, I wish I could meet all of you in person. Hugs to you all!",

The PS was hoping to do immediate pre-pectoral implant reconstruction but said he would be prepared for other options in case it wouldn't work. My breast skin was too thin so I ended up with TE's instead. So far doing pretty good. I find the hardest thing is trying to sleep....my back gets sore, not a big deal, but any tips are welcome. :) Good to read how everyone is doing. Glad to read that those that have been waiting for so long have finally gotten their TE's or exchange surgery and that everyone seems to be recovering well. Hi and welcome to the newcomers! Jadacrimson, this is a great place to reach out, get encouragement and know you aren't alone. There's strength in numbers. I hope you are recovering from your BMX, yours was the day after mine. Thinking of all you ladies, and praying for you. Hope you have a great weekend. ",

My drains came out about 10 days after surgery. I noticed that my right breast, even though there wasn't much in the drain, had some fluid on the bottom half. I've had to have it aspirated (?) a couple times already and it seems to be getting larger again........... I saw where some of you have dealt with seromas.

Hopefully they are able to get your scheduling worked out soon. In the wait, I think you will find that this forum is a life saver. I didn't find it until over month after my DX and after my LX. You are not alone, we are here for you. (BTW I'm too am 60, have been having mammos since my early 30's due to dense fibrocystis breast, multiple call backs for diagnostic mammos, a biopsy 10 years ago that turned out b9, but not this time.) Edited to say They didn't even do an MRI on me. I guess different BS do differently.",

I have a wonderful family but being able to share and relate with others walking through the same thing (generally, if not exactly) has been very helpful because you get it. Thank you for your encouragement & support. I hope each of you are doing well and are moving forward and getting back to \"normal\" life. Bless you all!❤",

Good to read your update, I'll be doing the same surgery with the exception of possibly straight to implant instead of TEs, pre-pectoral placement. It's good to get an idea of what may occur. Hope the various pains are starting to subside. Lidabit, thanks for updating. Glad you are doing okay, that your sister was able to come, and that you were able to make it to the beach. (the beach is just a good place to be.) I haven't had surgery yet, can't imagine how emotional that will be, but it's got to be hard. Did your PS say anything about the eventual possibility of getting feeling back? So glad your nodes were negative. Sending hugs and keeping you in my thoughts. Magjr, can you call your BS and ask them about the bra, if you need to bring one/if so what type, or if they supply one? It seems different surgeons have different thoughts about that. 2FUN, sounds like you are doing good! Raven4mi, I was wondering how you're doing. Sorry to hear of the increased pain this time but glad you are doing well overall. Hopefully pain subsides soon. I know you had talked about vitamin C infusions on a different thread, which aren't accessible, but what do you think of Emergen C? Do you think that is helpful at all presurgery? Wallan, I don't know from experience but I've read others posts on having UMX/BMX and being very tired, as the others have already said. Yvonne, glad to hear your BS was better this go round. The swelling, yikes, glad it's down. I read where someone else used pads for the drainage too. It seems like the whole drain thing is so individual as far as days the drains stay in, etc. NervousGal, glad you are recovering well, hoping that node remains clear.

It's not an easy decision and your age would certainly be a weighty factor. I'm sure there are pros and cons on both sides. Hopefully you will be able to connect with some younger ladies and hear how they processed and weighed out the treatment decisions. Then you can use those thoughts to help you think through and determine what is best for you. I'll be praying for you. Angyrojo - Hello, how are you? What type of surgery did you have? I'll be praying for you too. Please keep us updated. ",

Just reading different posts was so helpful. Glad you jumped in. And also, what great news that your nodes were negative. MariH, I had an LX, a pretty large area, and didn't have any drains. I've read where others have had an LX and have had drains. I don't know if it is the surgeon's preference, the area of the breast, or both that makes the difference. I didn't originally have SNB so I don't know about that. goldie63, Glad you are feeling good today. 2FUN, I read a few post from ladies with the vacuum suction and it seems like it was very helpful. Beachluv, plantchild, LisbethS hope your surgeries went well yesterday and you are resting comfortably. We are expecting snow tonight after a month or so of unseasonably warm weather.

I don't know what your hormone receptor & size of area are but these can also have a bearing on your level of comfort with LX or MX. You're not alone, and not crazy in your thinking but you are the only one that can make this decision. There are some great threads on the topic too. At least 2 or 3 that I am aware of, I'll try to find them and post the links. For me, I was also encouraged to do lumpectomy. I also had years of call backs, watch and waits, a biopsy, etc. I dreaded going for my mammogram, at times avoiding for several years at a time (I know it makes no sense but fear never is rational). I was told my survival rate would be the same, if I had recurrence, then they would do MX since you can't have rads again. I did go ahead with LX (lumpectomy). When pathology came back the size was 4.4 cm instead of the 2.5 cm originally thought. The fact that the size was so far off didn't help me feel comfortable. I was going to need to have a reexcision and it seemed like a large amount of my breast was already removed (small breasted). I decided on BMX, for multiple reasons, one big one being I didn't want to do rads. Interestingly, only after BMX, pathology also found LCIS and ALH. Though not cancer, those would have gone undetected. My nurse navigator said I definitely made the right decision. All that said, it is still a hard decision, and you have to weigh out the risk (and loss) involved with each procedure. Either way there are risk, and I think only you can decide which risk you are willing to take and and which is right for you. I know others will be along to encourage you. Wishing you the best.

I was uninformed on all this when I was first DX'd, I didn't get (or even know to request) my biopsy report until well after my lumpectomy and it's pathology. Only then did it occur to me to call the hospital where initial biopsy was done and request the pathology report. When I got it the hormone testing was an addendum which makes me think it was added at a later time. I say all that to say maybe when you received the path. report, if it was immediate, then the hormone status may not have been on there.(not really sure but just a thought). How are you doing? Your appointment is tomorrow correct? I hope you will get some of your questions answered. I'm going to mark this board as a favorite so I will be notified when you respond. I'm praying for you. MTwoman - they didn't even check for the HER2 expression with mine. From what I understand that's not a standard testing they do for DCIS is it?",

Just as a side note(and you may already be doing this), I found, if possible, it's good to take someone with you as a second set of ears. I had always been the second set of ears for others, my mom, my sister, etc. and was able to ask, hear, & retain the information being given, but since I've become the patient I can't seem to ask questions OR retain what was being said (even when my questions were written down I'd leave them in my purse). I was blessed to be able to have my husband there for most appts. It does sound like you are arming yourself with information to ask good questions. Let us know how you are doing. (((hugs & prayers to you)))",

The waiting can be such a challenging and scary time, but you will certainly find alot of encouragement and support here from everyone. I too was DX with DCIS in right breast, comedo necrosis, grade 3, hormone neg. I'm not nearly as versed as most of the ladies but in my particular case they tested to see if the DCIS was hormone feed from the biopsy sample. I was given the results when I met with the breast surgeon. I did do genetic testing as well, and that was to determine if I had the BRCA gene, which I tested negative for. I know the waiting really is the hardest, I will be praying for you. Keep us updated. Hugs and prayers. ",
