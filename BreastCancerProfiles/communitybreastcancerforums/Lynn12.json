I also have a PPO and I must say that I am thrilled with what they have paid.  I've had 3 surgeries (one of which had a 5 day hospital stay), 4 months of chemo, 30 radiation treatments, MRI'S, scans, blood work...the works.  My insurance company has been billed over $200,000 since 11/06 and I've had to pay under $1,000.  Most of it was the $250 per surgery.  They haven't denied one thing.  I think because you have a PPO, you should feel comfortable with your insurance. Best of luck to you! Lynn",

I had been diagnosed with herniated disk about 5 years ago, however the pain went away, then late summer I could hardly get out of bed. I finished chemo in May and radiation in July.  I told my Onc and he sent me for an MRI. The result was herniated disk and arthritis, no cancer.  I think it got all irritated from laying on the radiation table for 6 weeks.  After the MRI came back, I went to my PCP who then sent me to a spine Dr.  I had a steriod injection which didn't really work.  He also said there is another treatment for arthritis, but I just can't get myself to go through with it since I am still in reconstruction surgeries.  Hopefully it's not cancer, but do get it checked out! best of luck!",

I take tamoxifen to help keep cancer away, I take Ativan to help me sleep so I can live my life as close to normal as I can.  My Onc has no problem with me taking it to help me sleep. Rest is very important!",
