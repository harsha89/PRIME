Well, it's been 72 hours since my first treatment.  I was feeling so happy that I had escaped any bad side effects. I have felt pretty good actually!  Then last night came this leg pain from nowhere.  Bone pain!  muscle pain! Like needles in addition to overall achiness.  I got up and took a Vicodin left over from my surgery. I think I got a little sleep.  I am just achy this morning.  It's just my legs from hips to feet!  I wonder why just my legs?  Anyone else with this side efeect? Also, I went back to work yesterday and felt a little overwhelmed by the chaos.  I had difficulty focusing on more than one task at a time.  It was especially hard when people were talking to me as I worked.  I've always been a good multi-tasker but now I need to just focus extra hard.  My heart goes out to 38 Years Old. I am sending you my love and prayers. Cyborg, Ruthii and MamaV I love your wisdom.  Keep it coming! ",
