Today Is the first day without even over the counter medicine. Had my drain out 8th day which helped decrease the muscle spasms tremendously. Now feel like I have a huge sunburn on my front and around the back and when I move it hurts. But the pain is manageable and mostly annoying, like a sunburn. Still need to take it easy and not do to much. Did absolutely no house work the first week and just sat in a recliner. I'm only 40 and somewhat fit. Can't wait to get moving again. Have to do radiation and will find out about chemo on 23rd. Waiting on the mammaprint test. Hope everyone else is recovery well.",

I still have to meet with plastics and radiation to assess my options for reconstruction. Chemo will be assessed with a mamoprint test after surgery. I'm highly er+ so he was not sure if chemo would shrink my tumor. I apparently have 4 all together. They consider it a 7cm area, although the MO focuses on the largest which is 2cm. BS thinks I will need radiation. This scares me greatly. I'm hoping for a skin sparing mastectomy and a diep reconstruction. If PS says yes then my date will be moved. My BS thinks I may be too thin. Two kids left me with a nice donut of fat around my belly button that I think would make a great new breast. Any advice on possible radiation with the diep? Wish you all luck. I'm also still waiting genetic test",
