I shouldn't read into it, but I can't seem to stop. Like you busybody, I hate waiting and really struggling today at work. I think my wife is handling this better than I am, she senses things aren't right and seems to be more accepting the possibility than I am. I had to close my door at work and just bawl for a while today, then felt stupid b/c we don't even KNOW anything yet. Waiting is so hard. In the meantime, May we all have a weekend where we can focus on the things that bring us joy and contentment, while not suffocating the joys of today with the worries of tomorrow. For those such as DagnyT, who are no longer waiting and have received news they'd rather not have, I hope you are able to cherish and enjoy your weekend as well. You can get through this. I know you can. PS. If it's against the rules for me (as a husband and not a patient) to be here I understand and apologize. I'm just struggling today, and I know people here understand.",

If you have no lymph involvement that puts you as a very early diagnosis I would think. I'm sad for what you found, but relieved there's no node involvement. Are you in an area where you have a nurse navigator to help guide you through the process? My wife has lymph involvement and the surgeon thinks it's probably IBC, and speculates that we'll treat it like it's IBC, so I guess no need to test for it? We are at least stage 2, and I fear it'll get worse after the upcoming PET scan. I'm hoping her IBC symptoms improve with treatment. It KILLS me to see her uncomfortable like she is. A survivor friend told me that once we meet with the Oncologist with all of the tests in it gets easier. We learn staging, and all the details tuesday morning and I think we leave that meeting with a full plan in place. I do think it'll be easier in a way after that, even if we hear news we don't want to hear. We're still waiting for the HER-2, I'm told that might come today. I feel like I have lab-fatigue. My Wife is a teacher, so she can't have her phone with her in class, so every call comes to me for appointments and results. Now every time they call I just cringe because EVERY STINKING result we've gotten is the opposite of what we wanted and hoped for! I want it to stop, I want good news for freaking change. I bet you and many others here feel the same way. This is hard. I'm so sorry for everyone here for going through it. I started journaling. I typed three single spaced pages for day one alone. An author friend read it and told me to post it somewhere, I wish more spouses were here. That would be helpful. I told my wife we will read that journal exactly one year from now, and we'll realized how blessed we are. But I feel like I'm failing her because I'm on the edge of tears continually. She's all strong (not in denial, just better than me). I wish is WAS me. I think I could handle that better. I try to focus on the celebration we'll have someday, when we've beaten it. We've looked at funny T-shirts, and laugh about possible \"upgrades\" with reconstruction. But I'm letting fear get to me, and I know better. I saw a lady at lunch today with a bald head. I wanted to talk to her and encourage her, but I knew I'd just start bawling if I did. The fact that she's THERE, out eating lunch while getting treatment gives me hope! That will be us too I hope. I do think it gets better for both of us once we get our plan and start moving forward. Hang in there everyone. I've been assured by multiple survivors (some from 30 years ago when it was REALLY rough) that it DOES get better.",

Basically if the spot on the liver is part of the cancer, the oncologist said the most likely option was chemo forever. If it's not, then we have a chance of actually being cancer free someday. They can mange it even if it's spread to the liver, but she'll be bound to chemo forever. We're also scanning the brain as a precaution just to be sure it's not there also. We will begin chemo even while waiting for the biopsy. It's some kind of herceptin mixed with Perjeta to start, then we move on to other mixes it seems. But it all depends on what happens with the liver. So while we were hoping to put an end to the speculation, we're waiting again. She said that if the liver is positive, we back off on the strength of chemo since we'll be basically be doing it forever. As bad as that might be, it's better than being untreatable so we'll look at the bright side. They also indicated that they've had good success with mitigating nausea symptoms with chemo.

They tell me it'll be about a 7 hour treatment since it's our first time. I'm guessing you're going on Herceptin also since they want the EKG to make sure your heart is healthy for it. DagnyT, thank you for your kind words. Sending support your way on your upcoming procedure. I may have missed it, but you're then doing chemo after your surgery? Think of where we all were about two weeks ago: worried and wondering. I think a lot of us here are still in that phase, yet we made it through the last couple of weeks and we can get through these next few weeks too! And once we're through those few weeks, we'll hopefully have more answers and be ready to fight. Finally, we get to push back and fight. Prayers to everyone on this board. We can do this. ",

I've cried more in the last 2 weeks than ever in my life, and yet we've laughed so much. It's hard to describe, but humor is so important. My wife has decided that she wants to be a blond for a while. She's about to have her chance, and why not? Katlover: Hang in there. PharmGirl is right: Waiting is so difficult, and yes, the holidays seem to make that more difficult. But look at our experiences and you'll see that it does get better. As a spouse, I was paralyzed earlier, and our news hasn't been good, but we're both better now, because we know we're about to FINALLY have our change to fight back. If you get unfortunate news, your time to fight will be here too, and you absolutely can do it, and we'll be here to support you. The liver biopsy didn't happen. When he finally found the spot of concern he said he can't get to it \"safely\" without open surgery. So we won't be getting those answers for a while. However, it's very small, and it took several different attempts just to see it, and said it's not well defined. I'm taking that as kind of good news, but I don't know how the oncologist will take it. Either way, I don't like the idea of open surgery when we're about to start chemo, hopefully we won't go that route. Her port surgery went well yesterday. She's a little sore, but she asked me to take her to see Star Wars last night so that was fun! She's more sore today, but resting comfortably. We're both doing better now. For a week I kept waking up from dreams of her crying and vomiting and sick to her stomach, fearing that was coming with chemo. No spouse wants to see their loved one suffer like that, it's so disturbing. But those dreams have now finally stopped, and we're both very encouraged that treatments for sickness and nausea have come such a long way. We know three people who have been through chemo recently, and nausea wasn't a big issue for any of them. How things have improved! I'm in a MUCH better place now, and she's so ready to fight now! I'm rejoicing with those who have had good results here, and sharing many of your posts with my wife to encourage her. Dagny and Pharmgirl, We will have so much to celebrate this time next year, and I NEVER want to take that for granted!",

I guess we're in that rebound phase and she'll feel a bit better until we have chemo again a week from today. She went to work yesterday, and she's hoping that she can get back to work one week after each chemo treatment. She's a teacher so that'll be tough, but she wants to try it. Her chemo started 4 days before Christmas, and she slept most of Christmas eve and Christmas day. The kids travelled to visit grandparents, she slept, and the dog and I spent most of Christmas pondering life. I was so happy she could rest comfortably. She'd sleep 2 hours, get up and talk for half and hour then go lie down again. PharmGirl, How are you feeling now? You've probably encounter the fatigue, and I hope you're able to rest comfortably. The steroids really gave her energy, and made it harder for her to sleep the first night of chemo. After they wore off she felt that fatigue. I kept her on Zofran religiously every 8 hours for the first 6 days. While her appetite was good after the steroids, it started fading. You may have a similar experience. There are some things she really enjoyed prior to chemo that she can't eat now. One night she used a cough drop for her dry throat and the taste of it gave her nausea. Like you, she's hoping for a bit of weight loss, but I'd rather she not lose any weight. But she can still hold food down, and Zofran and the other nausea medicines have worked wonders, especially when she takes them around the clock. (though she's convinced they make her stomach feel odd). She's completely off them now, and dealing with other digestive concerns that seem to be par for the course :( Her biggest concern is still losing her hair. I shaved my head in solidarity, at least it was SOMETHING I could do amid so much helplessness. I think we'll get a wig prescription next week and then we start that process I guess... Sahicks, waiting was the hardest part for us. I think it was harder than the first 2 weeks of chemo has been so far. There's something about the unknown that we just can't handle. Praying for the days to pass quickly, and that you may find moments of joy and peace while waiting. Dagny, are you heading for chemo after your surgery?",

I THINK it's positive that her HER-2 is positive because it gives us more treatment options. However, we're told that HER-2 is more aggressive and we need a brain MRI to make sure it's not in the brain. So we have TWO tests and we need them to BOTH come out OK, or we go to stage four and move from what she called \"curable\" to \"incurable\" That's really hard to hear. It's treatable though, but the thought of her having to be on chemo forever is a bad one. We'll know in about 2 weeks, time to push back on the fear again.... Someday I will be as strong as she is.",

Maybe it doesn\u2019t matter since they\u2019re treating it as though it is IBC. Our surgeon was very encouraging about the prognosis though. She said even it IS IBC the prognosis is \u201cvery good\u201d. We know that two of the three ER, PR, HER tests are back and they\u2019re not what we wanted them to be. Hopefully the other will work so we\u2019re not dealing with a triple negative situation. But even if we are, I have a co-worker who had triple negative 10 years ago. She said the chemo was rough, but she\u2019s in perfect health today. It\u2019s so hard to go through this. I can\u2019t help, but I can be frustrated with you! :) This site is amazingly helpful. Will you let us know once you get confirmation on IBC? Do you have any appointments lined up for a surgeon or oncologist yet",

Like others on here, we're bracing for what's coming, much of it unknown.  USASAM: Reading through your earlier posts I know exactly where you're coming from. Our kids are older, but I wished so much I could take her cancer and have it instead of watching her struggle with it. I'm no longer a basket case, but instead want to put that energy into helping her get through this. It's hard on us spouses too!  SSWP: My wife will have to lose far more than her hair and breasts to be unattractive to me. When your husband complements you, he probably means it, and he doesn't mean just \"passable\". She hasn't lost her hair yet, but I already know she'll be beautiful. It'll be much harder on her though. Also, definitely yes to keeping your date nights. GenevaCandanienne: I love your analogy. My wife is about to go through the same cold winter. It sucks, but think about how glorious the \"warm spring\" will be! Hang in there everyone, we can do this.  ",

You may have already done this, so please ignore me if you have, but our nurse told us that she should take the anti-nausea medicine around the clock whether we need it or not for a few days. It's so much harder to stop than it is to prevent, so we're on a very strict every-six-hour schedule around here. My apologies if you have done that already. Also, Zofran can cause headaches, but it's possible that what they gave you in your drip on Friday is making that worse when combined with Zofran. We were warned about that also. If that's true, maybe the headaches will ease up a bit for you. I hope they will. I'm not an expert, we're on our first round, but I think it does get better, hang in there.  MJB1018: You're allowed to be negative sometimes, you're going through a lot! You can make it!!! Question for others: Are you ordering your wigs before you lose your hair, or is it better to wait? Our turn's coming, but we're both a bit unsure on where to start.",
