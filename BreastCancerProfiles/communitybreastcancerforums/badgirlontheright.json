I am in charge of 5 offices and over 40 clinical staff. I thrive on stress!!! Or at least I thought I did before I got called back for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on July 7, 2017. My screening mammogram showed \"architecural distortion\". It persisted on the diagnostic mammogram, but there was no correlate on ultrasound. Because of concern that a needle biopsy might miss the area, I am scheduled for a wire localization followed by excisional biopsy this Friday, July 28th. I have been an emotional mess! I am always taking care of other people and solving their issues and I feel like I don't have a clue about how to help myself. I have not been able to really talk to anyone about it because I am so emotional and I don't want people to think I am overreacting or weak. This has been the longest 3 weeks of my life and I still have waiting to do. I know most breast cancers do not cause pain. I wouldn't say I have pain, but I do have some discomfort or achiness. The right breast is larger than left, but I honestly can't say if that is a recent change. My right breast does feel full and a little swollen. I have an irrational fear of the wire localization. As a very young X-ray student, I watched a radiologist do several without any type of anesthetic. He thought it was unnecessary since either way they were getting a needle. It was awful for those women and the images have remained with me all these years. I have been assured that will not happen to me, but I can't erase those fears! My localization is being done 3 hours before the surgery and I can't imagine sitting in the waiting area with a wire sticking out of my boob. I have never had conscious sedation, only general and epidurals. My incision will be around the areola and I am scared I will feel it. I would prefer to be knocked out! I have always thought knowledge is power! I have read all sorts of information and case studies. I go between small reassurances and freaking out! At times, I think if they offered me a complete mastectomy that I would do it and not have to go through all of this! Doesn't that sound nuts???? I feel like I am losing it and that is just not normal for me. I am always in control! Maybe, I am going a little crazy from my insomnia! I am not sure what I am expecting from posting this message. I guess nothing except knowing I am not alone...or weak...or being silly...or crazy! Log in to post a reply",
