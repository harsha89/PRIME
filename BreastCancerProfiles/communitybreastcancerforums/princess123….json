If she said that you are \"dark energy\" that's a warning that if you keep pushing, she will cut you out of her life. I've have to do that to close relatives who crossed the line and tried to control my life. They laughed behind my back. I didn't need a crystal ball to see that.  Their patronizing tone said it all. Looking back, I realize that I outgrew them, and it was time anyway for me to make space for supportive people, who think on my level (or higher),  to enter my life. So I'd leave her in God's hands and still stay in touch (not every day), without contributing to her stress or you may lose her for good.",

Meanwhile, a cancerous tumor has been growing 8-10 years before it is big enough and dense enough to be detected by mammography. By the time a tumor becomes the size of a pin head, which is nearly two years into its growth, it can no longer be sustained by the normal blood supply and so it develops its own. The development of that blood supply is called angiogenesis.   Initially developed by the military, thermography is the only technology available that can detect angiogenesis. A tumor at this early stage cannot be detected by mammography or any other technology.   Relatively new to Canada and the US, thermography is widely used in Europe. Breast Cancer Screening using Thermography ( thermal imaging technology ) www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hieVRtcb7Y There is thread in the Alternative Forum called \"Breast Thermography\". It's only two pages. There was a women who was able to catch her thyroid cancer extremely early because she did a full body thermogram. That made me a believer. PM her to get more info.  ",

What I'm going to do, from now on, is first thermographs, if suspicious, then breast ultrasound or MRI, if suspicious, then breast tomosynthesis. ",

Citing 246 references, the paper synthesized existing knowledge regarding the use of intravenous vitamin C for numerous medical conditions and seeks re-evaluation of the place of intravenous vitamin C in the context of conventional oncology practice. \"Currently there is a great divide in the way intravenous vitamin C is viewed,\" said Thomas Ichim, Board Member of the Riordan Clinic and first author of the publication. \"On the one hand, you have alternative medicine practitioners, who have been claiming very interesting results in practical treatment of cancer patients, but cannot explain any molecular rationale for its use or potential effects.  On the other hand you have a great amount of scientific literature supporting possible relevance of this approach in cancer.  This paper is a significant step towards closing the divide.\" In the past, the use of vitamin C in the treatment of cancer has been considered controversial since some studies have claimed excellent results in extending lifespan of cancer patients, whereas other studies have not seen any effects.  The discrepancy seems to be explained by studies seeing positive effects utilizing intravenous vitamin C, whereas the failed studies used oral vitamin C.  Scientists at the Riordan Clinic were the first to publish, and patent, that intravenous, but not oral vitamin C, can achieve significant concentration in the blood in order to selectively kill tumor cells....READ MORE http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peer-reviewed-publication-supporting-intravenous-vitamin-c-for-cancer-patients-118646729.html",
