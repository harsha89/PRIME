I had a double mastecomy, and am now doing breast reconstruction, and I turned down the radiation because I did not see the risks out weighing the benefits, but maybe I am way wrong. I have made some unhealthy life choices (ex smoking cigs for 20 plus years,) that made me feel like radiation was not the best option for me. Once I told my medical team I was not on board with radiation, they treated me differently. almost rude. I just started Tamoxofen about 3 weeks ago, I did a good 6 months of dose dense chemo, and just felt like I didn't want to destroy my body any more. The DR's arent interested in discussing alternative therapies to ensure that cancer cells dont return, and maybe I am misinformed about lymph node presense. Does this mean that theres the possibility that there are cancer cells in my blood stream? I just figured, they removed my breast with the cancerous tumors, so now its all gone... Ok, I guess my post didn't really help nor answer your question, but I am also curious on the answer to this one....",
