I am a 73 year old male in good health until treatment.  My radiation-induced plexopathy began a couple of years after completion of treatment in January '04 and was only a mild numbness and tingling in my thumbs and first two fingers.  It has slowly increased in severity and it is equal in both hands.  Buttons have become difficult and cleaning my hard contacts is a problem as I often drop them. The Internet indicates that this is common with radiation to the upper chest, but unfortunately, most articles are very technical.  My upper chest was red following treatment.  I have dry mouth, consistant flem in my throat, Trismus (reduced mouth opening), almost no sense of taste and zero taste for sweet.  Nothing tastes good or even OK and I no longer eat sweets or popcorn as they do not taste good.  Everything has a neutral to bad taste and spices all seem to fall into the bad area.  Anything with grease causes my tongue to feel like it is coated with something slimy,  a very BAD feeling.  I eat only to survive and losing weight is a constant problem.  I also have the Dysautonomia mentioned by bill144.  I take Midodrine each morning (unless my BP is above 150) to raise the pressure and if it gets too high (above 170), I take Toporol to lower it.  Last month I had a high BP of 184/92 and a low of 58/35.  Sound familiar bill?",
