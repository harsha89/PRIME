On a scale of 1-10? I have no idea where I stood. My OB/GYN always emphasized extremely thorough BSEs because he said only I would know if a lump showed up that was \"different\" than my normal lumpiness. When I found an unusual lump, I had a mammo (showed nothing, not even calc) and then an ultrasound, which showed the lump plus two other nearby areas that were too small for me to be able to feel. The radiologist thought they were probably thickened tissue (possibly due to wearing underwire bras for so many years, he said). But he recommended core needle biopsy. Lump was benign, two other areas were DCIS. So my breast surgeon sent me for an MRI to find out if it was multifocal or on the other side. Here's where the different boat comes in -- not only did the MRI not show anything else on either side, neither did it clearly show the area that we already knew was DCIS! The radiologist said that with my dense breast tissue, the MRI wouldn't necessarily show it as well as the ultrasound did. End result (after I had bilat mx) was even more DCIS on the same side, in an entirely different area of the breast, and atypical hyperplasia on the right. None of which showed up on the MRI. So, if I still had breast tissue, I'd be requesting US from now on ... I'm afraid I've lost faith in MRIs as a diagnostic tool. I'm not sure anyone knows yet which particular situations it works best in. Sheila ",

(I had never heard that term!) I had bilateral mast on Aug. 13, immediate recon with expanders. I'm now filled to 400cc (the size my implants will be) and still have dog ears both sides of both incisions. I'm not overweight and was not large busted (solid B cup), so those factors couldn't have come into play for me. And now that I'm filled to 400cc, if the dog ears are left for recon \"space,\" wouldn't you think they'd have flattened out by now? So when I saw my PS last week I asked him about it, and if he can fix them when he does my exchange. He said he doesn't want to fix them because scar tissue is still living tissue, and he said the thin lines I have now at my incision will be much wider 10 weeks down the road -- and at that point my dog ears should disappear too. But from what I'm reading here, it doesn't sound like that happens necessarily. So I'm thinking I'll bring it up again when I see him before my exchange surgery. Sher, you mentioned not being able to go braless because the lumps show through -- that's exactly my complaint too!  Anyway, I'm curious whether anyone has seen the dog ears diminish with time, or if your incision line got wider like my PS is saying it will.
