I've had 14/16 treatments with last two tomorrow and Tuesday. I'm using Shea Moisture coconut oil for hydration (Walgreens or CVS). My RO nurse gave me hydrocortisone cream for itching and because I have a little redness I'm using 98% aloe spray. RO said not to use it directly from aloe plant. I bought 98% Aloe Vera Soothing Mist from Bio Miracle. Found it in Kroger/Frys. These SEs along with a little stinging/achiness come and go, All very manageable. I know others are not as fortunate and I'm very sensitive to their situations and feel so badly that anyone has to endure pain and discomfit. I'm sharing my postive experience because I'm also aware that so many of you are afraid. Please don't be. Don't assume the worst. You all can do this! I'm here to help in any way I can. The unknown is scary for all of us. My RO team is great and very responsive to my questions and concerns. Don't hesitate to advocate for yourselves. Ask questions. Share any SEs should you have them and get relief. Miaderm is supposed to be very good. I can't find it locally and I'm going to see if my RO has any samples.

When I was first diagnosed I was a deer caught in the headlights and couldn't process all the information and decisions I had to make. Totally unlike my personality type. However, as an educator for many years I knew there was more to just one test score. So i decided to empower myself with information and try to gain some control. Your initial post prompted me to action. I had to find out how my low clinicals factored into the equation. What concerns me is that medical professionals involved in our treatment decisions need to be more informed on how to interpret these test results. To be fair I think the complexities of MammaPrint/Bluprint makes it more challenging. However, discordant group data needs to be analyzed very carefully before treatment decisions are made. I hope this discourse helps others to research their own specific pathology whatever choices they make. This forum has been a wealth of knowledge for me and I am so grateful.    ",

It's terrifying, queenofwands, I was in the same exact place as you are now. I don't know your age. I'm 66 and my tumor was 9mm and no lymph invasion. I too, had a BS who pushed the Mammaprint test. In hindsight, I would have insisted on the Oncotype because of my low clinicals. At the time, I was so paralyzed with fear and so intimidated by my BS I just went with her recommendation for Mammaprint. Never did we discuss the implication of my being at low clinical risk. She made it sound cut and dry. Mammaprint High risk = chemo! Whoa, not so fast! My results came back as high risk at -0.13 just a bit over 0. I had a very lengthy consultation with the medical director at agendia. I learned that for me, being at low clinical/high genomic, the risk factors of chemo outweighed the benefits which was less than 2%. We discussed all the research findings and their implications. Looking at my mitotic rate (1), a low Ki67, and small tumor size, both my oncologist and radiologist were comfortable with my decision not to do chemo. This was a very personal and difficult decision. I read once, that there's all you can do and all you should do. I hesitated posting because I don't want to influence you or anyone in this difficult position either way. I also don't want anyone to second guess my decision. I fear recurrence, but there are no guarantees even with chemo. I completed my radiation treatments, I'm taking Arimidex with very few SEs, eat healthy, exercise regularly. and wine is saved for a special occasion. I try to take it one day at a time and view each day as a gift. Please feel free to PM me if you want to talk privately. I'm here to offer support to you and others as we navigate throughout this BC maze. I also want to thank Barred Owl and others. Through their posts and research, they helped me to put aside my fears, read the research, and to take ownership of my health and options. I can't thank them enough. I send love and prayers to all.

My RO nurse advised that I do self-breast exams regularly and to be aware of any changes in the breast. That coupled with regular screenings and our scheduled appointments, I guess is the best we can do with this new \u201cnormal.\" Gentle hugs all",

Please try not to let your worse fears get the best of you. There are many variables to breast cancer and everyone's situation is different. You will get a lot of support from the wonderful men and women on this site and from our moderators. Stay off the internet and verify everything with your doctors. There are many treatment options available depending on your pathology report. It is normal to think that every pain and twitch is MBC, especially when you are newly diagnosed. You're carrying a lot of stress and it can show up in physical ways i.e. backaches. Here's a few suggestions that I learned along the way. 1. Get referrals for your breast surgeon, medical oncologist and radiologist (if needed) from you personal care physician or through word of mouth. Ask as many people as you can. 2. Get second opinions if you're uncertain about your treatment options and get another doctor if you're not comfortable with them. I wish I had done that earlier in my journey. 3. Ask questions and more questions. I was so intimidated in the beginning that I was afraid to look at my pathology report. However, we are our own best advocates. A very wise man told me that in general if women advocated for themselves like they would do for a daughter, mother, or sister they would be better off. I want you to know that you are not alone. There are many wonderful people on this site that are and have been my angels. We are here for you!! Sending love and strength ",

This along with my clinicals, etc. should provide a treatment plan. I know there are no guarantees. I'm scheduled for my radiation simulation March 30. But, if chemo is recommended we would have to start that very soon and wait on radiation.I'm really anxious and afraid of the chemo and all that goes with it. I'm a strong person but all I seem to do is cry. My poor husband has never seen me like this. I signed up toattend a support group in April. I'm hoping this helps. Thank you all for your support. I know things can be worse and my prayers go out to everyone dealing with this disease.",
