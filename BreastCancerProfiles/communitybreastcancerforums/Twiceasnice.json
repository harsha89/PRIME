      "Content": "Twiceasnice wrote: Hi Ladies: I've been on tamox for 2 1/2 years and after seeing my oncologist this week, I'm about 90 percent certain I'm gong to have at least my ovaries removed--possibly my uterus too (though I'm concerned about pelvic prolapse) I was going to wait until the 3-yr mark of Tamoxifen, but I've had 2 close girlfriends diagnosed with cancer (one is triple negative BC) and I think the time is right. Am I being overreactive? Do most people with my path:  ER+ PR + and HER2+, node positive, get their ovaries removed? I've been on Zoladex for 2 years. Does anyone have thoughts on ooferectomy vs ooferectomy AND hysterectomy? My doctor might switch me from Tamox to an AI based on the Pfizer erometase study and the MA17 study. Does anyone have personal experience with the switch before the 5-year mark of being on Tamox? Thank you!

I am seeing my oncologist tomorrow to discuss switching to an aromotase inhibitor since I hear studies show good outcomes for those with their ovaries removed after 2 or so years on Tamox. Any questions I should ask or issues I should be concerned about in switching? Thanks!",

Two different hospitals reviewed the slides and they said sometimes the nodes \"stick\" together when they cut them out of the fatty pack. That's why one report shows 5, the other 4. Unfortunately, due to changing guidelines, it didn't make a difference with respect to radiation. It was still recommended at 4 or 5 affected nodes.  Thanks again ladies---",

(BTW what date is used for survival rates is it the date when chemo ended?) I need some words of encouragement Six months ago, I lost my mom and sister in the same week. My mom was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer and she died 2 1/2 weeks later: My sister took her life the week my mom died. I never really went back to work full time since treatment ended. I worked PT but really enjoyed life and traveled making enough to get by but taking time away from a stressful PR career in the nations capital Now the money is about to run out and I'm looking for aFT job in my career to earn enough to get back on my feet I'm not really stressed but I'm feeling the heat so to speak. I could use ( a job) but really words of encouragement or advice Hugs to all Dx 10/26/2009, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 3/18 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
