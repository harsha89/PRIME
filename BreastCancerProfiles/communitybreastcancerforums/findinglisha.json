There were 3 lumps they were watching but they all didn't change in size or shape so the doctor gave her the thumbs up that she was good. 3 months later, she decided to get her blood test done and while do that, she decided to do another mammogram. The nurse's facial reaction was all my mom needed to see, at that point, they rushed her to see the oncologist immediately the following day. They did a biopsy on May 12th on just one of the suspicious tumor, we got the results 3 days later.. May 16th and it was cancer.. Her tumor is 1cm and at grade 3. I am quite concern about the grade 3, I know that it is aggressive. We are currently waiting for the insurance company to approve of her MRI and her surgery. (They said it will be 2-3 weeks until the approval) It won't be another few weeks until she will have her surgery, from the time we are waiting till the time we have surgery.. I am afraid that the tumor will grow and spread. How likely is this to happen in a month span? If the doctor was concerned, wouldn't he have expedited it? I am trying to stay as positive as I can, but I can't help but break down sometimes because you know its.. your mom. Anyone with any advice, I thank you in advance. Log in to post a reply",
