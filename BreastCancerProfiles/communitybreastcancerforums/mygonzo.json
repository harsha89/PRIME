My sister and daughter stayed here for about a week and she practiced on my poor violin. You have done so much better than I have far as lasting husbands.  But on the positive side.  They all lasted 10 years and I'm am still on good terms with them PS, eyes still wonky from falling down the stairs. Will be good after maybe second surgery. Thanks for Medicaid and Disability Oh, PS I asked that my account be deleted 1 week ago because I was overwhelmed , But even though I asked for my name back, I have my cat's name Doing happy dance for NED too.",
