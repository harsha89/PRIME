Her tumor was >5 cm, and that is why they say she needs rads.  As far as vascular involvement, she didn't mention it, but I will ask her.  I have read in many different places that the trip neg responds very well to chemo, and that is wonderful news.  My hope is that after the chemo they will tell her she won't need the rads.  Thank you for the great info and support!  It is nice to know that there is support out there for the ones involved that don't have the cancer.  I know we don't go through the disease and treatment, but it is mentally and emotionally draining on family and friends of the patients also!  Thanks again, and best wishes to you also.",
