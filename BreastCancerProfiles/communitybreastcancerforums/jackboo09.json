In between my post and this one I have taken Lucy out for lunch and had a good chat. I have put her in the picture with what I know and what I am dealing with and her reaction was better than I expected. She is a tough cookie and quite a logical child. I have suggested that she visits my brother and his fiancée in Wales over the Easter weekend. It would be a break for her. I will go if I'm able but I suppose I would be in treatment so may not be able to. The boys will be busy revising for their GCSE exams. Both are 16 yrs old. If I can see all 3 enjoying life, away from worry I will deal with it easier I think. Throughout all this, counselling has not been mentioned. There should be a service available for people given this news but our National Health Service is already severely stretched. Accident and Emergency departments across the UK are at crisis point. I really took on board your point about women feeling better a few months out from this first dx. It's just that I'm frightened about feeling ill with the treatments but then again I'm frightened by the whole thing. In theory I beat this disease once, or stopped it in its tracks. After 6 years I was so very sure that Herceptin was my saviour! Maybe it can work again? Thank you again, it helps so much to talk. Liz",

You are years on from this Stage 4 dx and can relate to the initial shock and how to deal with it. Good to know that you approve of my chat with Lucy. Although a personal decision; it's good to know that others think you have done the right thing and it's lifted the element of pretence that I have been carrying around with me! It wasn't as bad as I expected, although Tue will be hard. The gentler chemo regime has me both hopeful and a little concerned. Having chemo again really scares me. It's the thought of things going wrong and ending up in hospital and all the side effects. So gentle sounds good. On the flip side is there any mileage in going for a strong regime if I only have spread to one area? I will wonder whether the docs are more concerned for being gentle over best results. Is it unrealistic of me to hope for NED, perhaps if I can have surgery, followed by other treatments? Anyway I am second guessing for England here so will have to wait and see. Sending hugs back to you across the miles! Liz x",

Thanks for the note about gentler chemo. I am making some false assumptions here and jumping the gun before I have the whole picture! My breast care nurse says it's because I am a teacher and I love to plan. I have been given lots of great advice on this forum and being off work now means that I have the time to look into various options. The clinic in Manchester has excellent facilities but I very much doubt it as a treatment option because of cost. However I may well use its second opinion service. The cancer charities are one avenue of support and will be able to help me navigate financial matters. Macmillan offer grants and as yet I'm not sure what benefits I may be entitled to. The story of your dear friend is uplifting and I do hope she continues to do well. 6 daughters- goodness me, she must be one busy mum! My family and I have a holiday booked in August, in England so no foreign travel. I live in hope that we can go. It is a company called Center Parcs. They have a number of holiday villages set in acres of woodland and we love the whole family friendly set up. I am frightened about getting my results tomorrow because I think I will swing back down again. When I think about walking in that room I feel running in the opposite direction. I know my husband is hoping for a surgical option but we have been told it is unlikely. For me, the location of this mass is adding to my fear, but as you said treatment does work for many. I have only come across one other person who I believe had this kind of mets, but again I may be confused? I had one positive intra mammary node in 2011 and so it appears that the route has been through lymph nodes into the chest area. All very scary. Thank you Chrissy for holding my hand through this. Love Liz",

They ordered the CT and told me it was all clear. Unbeknown to me they then passed it to the BC team who had a multidisciplinary meeting last Wed and discussed this \" shadow\". This has made the shock worse. I know I can't change this but I am not coping. I have hardly slept and feel sick at the thought of resuming treatment. I also can't seem to find many ladies with a reoccurrence in either lungs or behind breast? Perhaps I should try and get some anti anxiety meds",

Still in the dark. I find out biology of tumour on Tue. In the meantime I am on high dose blood thinners for this clot which is causing me fatigue and I seem to have bowel issues, lost some weight too. This medication in itself is a challenge as I am on a higher dose of a Rivaroxaban for another 9 days before I swap to a lower dose. My husband has been amazing but I think he is beginning to crack: he has just gone to the gym and is quiet. My 14 year old girl appears to have no friends and relies on me to take her out at the weekend. She really worries me. I am trying so so hard to be positive but it is like my world has stopped and already the relationships around me are changed. I am über clingy with husband and I have to try and pull back I think. Ideally I would suggest a holiday for us right now but I'm only at the beginning of my treatment- the very beginning. I looked into a private clinic in Manchester last night. Perhaps just for their second opinion service. I have a shred of hope that this could be benign but something has caused this clot and I'm prepared for it being mets. Chrissy I know you have said there is hope for me to return to something of the life I had just 2 weeks ago- will that be or am I at the start of becoming ill again with treatment. I want to start SOMETHING as soon as I can but I'm premenopausal so even anti hormonals won't be an immediate option, injections to switch my ovaries off was discussed. I love my family beyond words and I don't want any of this for them. I am sorry for the negativity guys- only you ladies will understand.  Liz",

Is it possible to have the Her 2 drugs without chemo? My breast care nurse talked about single agent chemo given alongside Herceptin. I did well on Herceptin, just a runny nose and tiredness on infusion day. My \" shadow\" is in my chest/ possibly in an internal mammary lymph node. Maybe that makes it more of a candidate for full systemic treatment. 6 years ago the docs were saying that the future was mono clonal therapy and that it would be given without chemo. Forgive me, I don't know enough about this yet. I had hoped to never need it! Best wishes Liz x",
