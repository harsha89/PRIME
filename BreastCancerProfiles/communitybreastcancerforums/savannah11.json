The one lump doc found was clusters of fibroid cysts. I was told that the lump I found was just breast tissue at the time of the mammogram/ultrasound. I went for my 6 week check up with my doc and she (and I) can still feel the lump I found; and it is hard and not moveable so she is sending me to a general surgeon about it. Should I expect for them to do a biopsy? I'm not really worried about it, I just want to know what it is.. And be prepared for my apt with the general surgeon.. Savannah Log in to post a reply",
