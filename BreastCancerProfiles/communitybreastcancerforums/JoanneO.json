It wasnt too bad . Lat year it came back in my femur, just radiation. THIS year, its back again,, liver, lungs, bones. Got my port put in,, and now starting chemo again Oct 7. Here's the thing though,, I was offered a clinical trial, which I turned down because of the SE's listed, ( taxol, 1/wk, and avastin wk 1&3) Come to find out, after turning down the clinical trial, the Doc has ordered me Taxol and Avastin. He says Taxol is a \" mild\" chemo drug, and that the SE's won't be bad. That most people tolerate it well, and usually if you have a SE from Taxotere, you won't have it from Toxol, as its a totally different drug. As for the Avastin, he says most people do NOT develope most of those SE's I am worried about. I am seriously thinking of finding another Dr, or not doing chemo at all, and just trying to do this naturally. Any ideas? THX",
