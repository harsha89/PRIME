The radiologist will numb your breast and with the aid of the mammogram he will insert the wire into the suspicious area and suture it into place. I felt no pain at all with it of course except the usual mashing from the mammogram. The biopsy was done under general anesthesia and I did not have much pain at all. It was a little tender is all and tylenol controlled my pain just fine. Good Luck and my fingers are crossed that you get good news! HUGS",
