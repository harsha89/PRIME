I was initially advised to watch and wait 6 months in order to monitor any changes as opposed to a biopsy and upon the recheck it was IDC. Lastly I had a difficult time on the hormone blockers and tamoxifen was an especially terrifying experience. I finally switched MOs due to an insurance change and she immediately took me off Tamox and now I am on femara and doing fairly well expect for extreme fatigue which may or may not be a SE.

I have seen some studies that after 20 or 30 years the chances of distal recurrences go down but I suspect that the sampling pool died of other causes so how can they figure that in? How could researchers possibly know if a dead person would have developed mets? Stats mean little to me these days and it strikes me as junk science.",

How can they possibly ascertain who survived BC vs who would have survived if not taken by another illness/accident when BC generally strikes in latter years. Believe what you want but I still stand behind my thoughts that it is junk science or an educated guess at best, but nothing more. Stats can be manipulated or interpreted in many ways and I question the science with so many variables. Regardless, as for me, when I am in my 80s or 90's I doubt I will take much comfort knowing that my distal reoccurrence stats have improved. It is all just noise to me at this juncture.",

When the area was first found my Gyn said to go off caffeine for three weeks and then go back to see her. When it did not go away I was sent for dx mammo and US. That was clean but GYN still wanted me to go to a BS. he chose to wait six months and at that point it was IDC. Stay on it.",

As for me I still think much about this damn disease but it in no way monopolizes my life and while fear sometimes creeps in, it is more a fleeting thought than anything nagging or crippling. It changes you in some respect but it does not define you. You will come to know this and life will go on much as before. Until then hang in there.",
