I had all my lymph nodes removed (only one was found to be infected). I have not been given much information on lymphedema and what causes it. I can only go on what I have found on the internet. It seems to be that you have to avoid EVERYTHING! Hot baths, lifting, flying etc.. Could anyone tell me what caused their lymphedema? Was it an obvious injury/insect bite or did you just wake up with a swollen arm? Many thanks, Becky Dx 3/31/2010, ILC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 1/26 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
