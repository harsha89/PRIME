I finishing radiation in April and it took my doctor over 2 months to find out why I was coughing. I have been having horrible leg pain and the doctor thinks its from the prednisone. I have been drinking tonic water to try and relieve some of the pain at night because it is so bad. Does anyone else have this problem?
