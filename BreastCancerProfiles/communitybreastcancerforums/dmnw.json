When the doctor told me about the marker would be inserted when I do the biopsy I told her I wont have those foreign objects inside my breast. I guess the biopsy wont be done until I can find a doctor who really care about my oppinion.  Once these are inserted its permanent and if you are having problem with these marker no doctor want to removed them it likes taking major surgery to have them removed which will even cost more problems. These marker are a big money making business for the people who sell them and the doctor who put them it.  Doctor will tell you the marker are safe but they are not. If you know any doctor who will do the biopsy without the marker clip it would be very appreciated. Thank for responding to my post and for the info.   ",

I am happy you are not having any problems with the marker bur for me I don't want it in my breast. I am leaving it in God hands and hoping to find a doctor who will do the biopsy without the marker.  If you know of any doctor please let me know. Thanks.     ",

Doctor stated it standard procedure and it can not be done unless the marker is put in.  I refused to have this done to me so am asking to find names of doctor who are willing to do the biopsy without the marker.  Please help am very stress right now as I write about this situations. I don't know what am going to do but I will not have this done to me. I rather have no breast than have these foreign object inside my breast.  Log in to post a reply",
