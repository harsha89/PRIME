I did get pre-certification. Thanks for all the good tips on getting future screening MRIs covered - I'm sure my BS will recommend them... Any way, when the bill ($27k) for my lumpectomy was submitted, it was denied automatically - reason \"we don't have a signed statement on file to say you have no other insurance coverage\" - I think this is chauvinist thinking - married woman with own primary insurance, huh, she must also be covered by her husband?  (Well actually we work for the same company so can pay a lot less for two separate individual policies than one family policy.) The insurance person I spoke to was actually quite nice and said she was surpised it was the only thing to be denied so far! Claim now going through for the second round.... Keep up the good work in stopping these insurers from dictating our treatment!",

If you had mastectomy then it depends on your individual risk e.g. was the tumor close to the skin or chest wall (which means you would be at risk because they can't go too far when removing the tumor).  I just got my port implanted today. It is in my chest about 3 inches below the collar bone, so it won't show under all but the lowest cut tops. It felt like someone kicked me in the shoulder straight after the procedure, but now (after about 3 hours) it feels fine - but maybe that's the vicodin! Oh, and I have to keep the dressing on and I'm not allowed to shower until Saturday! Good excuse to use the jacuzzi tub for a change. I've had about 20 needle sticks over the last month for tests/meds and I could feel the effects on my arm veins getting worse with each one. The IVs for my surgery and port implant (in my hand) were painful and made my hand and arm feel freezing cold - I'm hoping the port will make the chemo much easier. I started losing weight as soon as I found the lump (I put it down to anxiety) so far I've lost 10 lbs but I'm not too unhappy about that - just wish some would go from the thighs!! I also noticed some other weird stuff, like my sense of smell was suddenly more sensitive to certain things - one day I left a half glass of wine on the counter and the next morning the smell of it was overpowering to me. My onco nurse said it was very important to have a healthy diet with plenty of protein as the white blood cells need that to rebuild after treatment. And of course over the next couple of weeks be careful to avoid sick people as you don't want to be starting chemo (they may even make you wait) if you get a cold or flu! Hope everyone is well, Lou.",

After the second tx I felt OK Thursday apart from dizziness so not able to drive, and pretty much wiped out Friday and Saturday, OK Sunday and back to work on Monday, though only working 6 hours or so the first week back.  I took longer off for the first treatment as the neulasta pain and digestive issues were much worse.  The main issues I've had are tiredness, bad memory - I have to write down everything I need to do! - and poor concentration.  Fortunately my supervisor (and company mangement generally) are very supportive and I haven't had any problems with not being able to keep up my previous work load. As for fatigue side effects, I found I can't manage to do much other than drag myself from the bed to the couch, turn on the TV and eat 'instant' food (e.g. yoghurt, ice cream) on the Friday after TX. A bit better on Saturday, can manage a walk or small jobs around the house, then OK the next few days but needing more rest/naps. Even in the third week between treatments I'm still finding I have less energy than usual, but I am also slightly anemic - onc told me to take an iron supplement and I'm hoping that helps.",

Saw the oncologist again last Friday and decided against the TC vs TAC trial - onc really wanted me to get TAC as my tumor is so agressive and triple neg, so chemo is the one treatment option and we are not risking doing less than is possible. I did get good news that there is no sign of mets from CT or bone scan so I can officially say I'm stage 2. Onc pointed out my bone scan showed significant arthritis for my age - I said I didn't need a bone scan to tell you that - just listen to my knees! I haven't cried much since the first couple of weeks after my diagnosis - when I did it was when I had to tell other people, or when friends were just so nice to me and I was overcome with emotion (I always cry at weddings and romantic movies...) I don't know if I am really that strong, but I can't change what I am going through, so I've decided to spend as little energy as possible on being down. Well, on the practical side, I probably have not bought everything I should have - I have 2 more prescriptions to get - a numbing cream (Emla) to put on the port and a high-flouride toothpaste as I won't be able to use the flouride rinse my dentist normally has me use as it has alcohol in it. Stuff I would never have thought of.... I did treat myself to an iPod touch so I will have something to keep me entertained during treatment. I will also take my laptop (the clinic has wi-fi so I will be able to post real time!!) and a book, as well as DH for company. The clinic also has a patient kitchen with snacks and drinks and we are allowed to take our own food. I will be there over lunch for my treatments, don't know if I will be hungry, but I have bought fruit ices to eat during the adriamycin treatment as everyone says this helps avoid mouth sores.

I put the Emla (lidocaine / prilocaine) cream on the port site just before leaving home, (I covered the cream with a mylar coated dressing, but the nurse said Saranwrap works just as well!) and by the time the needle was put in I did not feel a thing! I was given more steroids, Aloxi and Emend first, then taxotere via pump, adriamycin from 3 syringes pushed by the nurse, then the cytoxan via the pump.  I didn't have any bad reactions and felt fine after the session, which lasted about 3 hours.  The nurse did say that the worst will come after I stop taking the steroids (i.e. Friday) Tomorrow I have to go back for a neulasta shot - hoping that goes just as well!  Felt good enough to go with DH to the mall straight after treatment to look at watches (he wants a new one for his birthday end of April). Took compazine before heading to the mall just in case, and another one with my evening steroid dose - so far no feelings of nausea, but after I got home crashed for a couple of hours, a little bit of pins and needles in feet, a couple of hot flashes, and feeling thirsty. Oh, and there's the red pee from the adriamycin! For those of you who are wondering about getting the port, after today, and comparing with the IVs I had for surgery, I would say GET A PORT! The recovery from the port insertion was not too bad - after 1 week the site is still sore if I rub against it accidentally, but 99% of the time I don't know it is there. I was told not to shower for 3 days after the port insertion. I do have a small teddy bear with me in the car who sits on my tummy and holds the seatbelt away from it for me! Hope everyone's upcoming treatments go well! Lou.",

I had neulasta 2nd April but didn't get the bad bone pain side effects (lower back and hips, and right knee which is arthritic) until this Wednesday.  That was the day after they told me my wbc was really low.  For treatment protocols without adriamycin they may wait to measure the wbc before giving you the shot.  I found that the injection itself was not too painful, I had a little soreness of the injection site the next day. Worst side effect so far for me has been the effect on taste - I finally felt up to having a glass of wine last night (I love wine and have a small wine cellar in my house) and it tasted like paint stripper! Well, looks like I'll have to cancel my wine club memberships for a while, and go back to drinking tea! I also got the same bad taste with Fresca (grapefruit soda) and almost as bad with beer.  I wonder what they have in common? It's now day 10 for me and I feel about 95% - it took longer than I was hoping but I should have 10 days of 'normal' before my next treatment - except for hair falling out which should happen next week. I have cut my hair short (for me) and will give it the 'buzz' once it starts to fall. Keep strong, Lou.",

The good news is that it only lasted 24 hours. Also, my nurse advised 'tylenol extra' for the pain, which really seemed to help - ask your onc or nurse if it is OK for you...  ",

As for TAC vs. A/C followed by T - my onc recommended the TAC as I'm triple neg and it gives a higher overall dose, I think. Also it is less total treatments, though the SEs can be worse. So far, so good, I am coping OK. Good luck to everyone with your upcoming treatments. Lou.",

Went to a friend's wedding in North Carolina last weekend and had a nice couple of days' break there. Got my 4th (of 6) TAC yesterday, go for Neulasta this afternoon.  So far my SEs have been relatively mild, mainly wierd digestion (5 days of constipation then flips the other way until my next TX) and messed up taste buds. I've noticed that I need to add sugar to berries and I can't drink coffee at all - just too bitter! And last night I tried some asparagus - one of my favorite veggies normally - and it was horrible.  I've also gone into temporary (I hope) menopause and suffering with the hot flashes especially since we had the air con fail in our house in NC last weekend, and the same thing here in VA this week! Air con is fixed now - but I will be asking my doc about the black cohosh as I am triple neg hopefully I will be OK to take it. Good luck to everyone, Louise.",

I am not looking forward to getting the port - I've seen many reports of it being more painful than breast surgery.  I had my lumpectomy/SNB on 3/4 and I have been sore ever since in the area between the two incisions (fluid/swelling). I still can't wear a bra all day, so I'm hoping the port heals faster than that. I was asked to consider a clinical trial of TCx6 vs. TACx6.  They want to find out if the TC works as well as TAC with less side effects - if it does that would be a great treatment advance. I still might go in the trial - there's a 50/50 chance I would be on the same treatment anyway, just not sure yet as I don't know if my insurance company would still cover all the treatments if I get TC as apparently its not officially approved.  But I've seen lots of people on other threads say they are getting TC... so maybe the insurance would not be a problem (it will cost them a lot less than TAC + a Neulasta shot each time!)   Has anyone else had issues with insurance for a clinical trial?",
