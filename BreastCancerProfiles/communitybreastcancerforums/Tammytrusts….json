      "Content": "Jul 11, 2010 05:02PM - edited Jul 11, 2010 05:06PM by TammytrustsGod Of course!  I am the strongest kid of four.  I have been through a ton and always like a dozer.  I have never been vein, or worried about my looks, but take off a couple of boobs and it makes a difference!  I am not scared because I know that I am in God's hands and on his time clock.  I do not worry about what would happen to my children if I were to die. I do not worry about my husband or family either.  I know that God knows best and I trust him. However, I had the same feelings when I got home from surgery.  I had surgery on June 8th and my first chemo. treatment on July 1st.  I am just  now feeling more secure with my looks and current physical condition.  My chest felt tight and it gets worse during the first two weeks.  Do your exercises no matter what!!!!!  The best ones that I have found I got from a book from the American Cancer Society.  They have a number to call and you can get information mailed to you.  The worse part was being intimate with my husband.  But you can and should do it as soon as you feel like it.  Not sure if you are married?  Anyway, it gets better and you both get used to it and you get stronger in you arms.  And for me it is already good again.  We really do not love people for how they look.  We love them for who they are.  If you are confident, your husband will be happy that you are happy.  If you are not, try to cry when he is not looking.(I got this advise from a girl in my chemo room).  She seemed pretty smart!  This is her second time with BC. Keep it simple at first, and you will get there!  In Christ's Love,",
