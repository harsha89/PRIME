After introductions he stated they were going to take me on a tour to go over everything and take some time to X-ray, take pictures, etc so the appt would be about 30 mins and hoped I'd been told this before hand. I had. The \"tour\" was nice and covered quite a bit. From which simulation had been chosen, explaining the process in detail. RO came in and explained the treatment plan again, dose and why she chose the simulation where I didn't hold my breath because I am a lefty. They also explained why I would not have a mold, the, sharpies, etc. explained How the were using the laser guides to line me up with the tattoos. Like AJ they also moved me with a sheet or would warn me if they needed to touch me or one would enter or leave the room. There were 3 techs -- two men and one lady. The lady tech was always in the treatment room with me. Everyone was courteous and veryfriendly. The lady tech ensured I was always covered and would let me know if they needed \"expose\" me. I had warm blankets and ceiling art and music was relaxing. I think I nodded off a few times. The RO came into the room several times until she felt everything was just right. She kept adjusting my left breast and the bubble wraps she had placed there to keep the breast propped up to reduce the chance of skin issues. She did tell me she is concerned about how the skin will fair due to the fold and will watch it carefully and make any needed adjustments. During my journey I have been very fortunate so far to be cared for by men and women we have been beyond professional, kind, patient and take their time to answer questions. I am appalled and hurt for those that don't have a decent experience during this journey. all that we go through is hard enough! Thank you for sharing your stories and experiences with us so that we know what to watch out for. Mbecause I read through this thread I paid attention today.",

One of the guy techs came back and covered me up and apologized for the oversight and indicated they covered us up not because of harm from radiation but to ensure we felt comfortable, warm and for \"Modesty\". I told him I think I lost all modesty way before starting RADs, he chuckled. By the way I had a different female tech today who left me exposed -- my assigned female tech was out. The new female tech was not as \"forthcoming with information\" as they prep'd me nor friendly. She sounded like she was scolding me for moving after taking the x-rays. I politely said, \"I don't remember moving nor did I adjust myself\". The male tech stepped in quickly and polity explained the issue as both could see I was not happy with the female tech. It showed me that the demeanor of the tech has a lot to do with our experience during treatment. The RO came in before I left and apologized. I guess the \"word\" got out quickly that I was not a happy camper. The rest of the treatment the male tech took the lead (big smile).",

My underarm around my ALND incision scars and underneath the breast look the worse. I continue the routine of protecting the skin and have a follow-up scheduled at the end of March.

I will miss seeing the techs, nurses and RO and having the security of doing something that focuses on killing the Cancer. But I am glad Rads are done. Not sure what to do with my time.

I am also a left side RAD. I went in for my Rad simulation yesterday, it wasn't bad and the techs were wonderful and funny. I received my Rads Schedule. I was surprised that my schedule was reduced from 33 RADs to 25 RADs, I knew there was a possiblity of reducing to 30 RADs; however was very surprised at the 25. I will have RADS to the left chest, underarm, and up to my neck due to the # of positive nodes. With so much territory to cover as explained in the simulation by the RO, I am surprised at the reduction to 25 treatments. Question: How many of you are getting the standard # of RADs, 30-35 vs the new shorten schedule which is usually between 4-5 weeks. I have a call into my RO. She may have mentioned this during my consultant (not simulation) but due to fatigue and chemo brain I may have missed it and/or didn't grasp the meaning until I saw it on paper. I also believe it maybe due to the fact that they never found a primary tumor and I only had cancer in the lump nodes, which is a rare presentation called \"primary occult\". The medical team scheduled me for several MRI's and US to make sure and results were negative for any cancer in the breast area that could be seen. Interesting enough the main page on BCO.org had an article discussing the shorter RADs schedules that a lot of ROs are adopting. Thanks in advance for your feedback.",

The RO also indicated the back would get affected because they also aim a small beam of rads to the back side for the clavicle treatment in my cente I specifically asked if this was an exit issue and she said no it was actually getting RADS. I have finished my first week and tired. Saw one of my young cancer buddies this morning. His Mom is so sweet. Well don't no about you but I am ready for the weekend. I am exicted as I have a 3 day weekend and feeling a little bit better but going to live it up by sleeping in, walking and relaxing and continue to repeat this pattern until Tuesday morning. TGIF and have a great weekend.",

Agree JeniferE, what does good night sleep feel like. My husband bought a fit bit and it tracks your sleep patterns. It says I get about 4 hours of \"good\" rest a night. No wonder I am so tired. I am out of Ativan so bought some Advil PM...hum even that doesn't keep me sleep all night. Saw that you are in the East Bay too. Did you enjoy the warm weather this weekend? ",

RO is concerned and watching under arm and clavicle area as they are darkening and becoming tender. Fatigue is really an issue for me and has been through this journey and Rads has been no different. I was not out of shape before dx - worked out and weight trained. So not sure why I am not fairing well with this fatigue. I have become a napper and learned to take advantage of Power naps and rest periods. LoL Quiggy, I told my RO on WednesdayI am just tired, sore and in Pain. She saw me today in the waiting room and came over too encourage me and asked what she can do to make this any easier. I said stop and her response anything but that. She asked if I had enough pain medicine and said if needed she would refill my Norco and Ativan. I told her yesterday I was almost out of both. Love her. Forgot who asked, my RO did warn me that I may get a sore throat since I am getting Rads to the neck area. My throat soreness (minor) became noticeable yesterday. With this said I am not horse just a sore throat. Counting down and can see that light at the end for the tunnel! Next up 10 years of hormonal therapy according to MO and possible ovary removal....",

Maybe not always in the forefront but a thought because this experience has totally changed me forever, but I can say for the better. I would always talk about living intentionally and on purpose before BC, but after BC I really have refined my definition of what living intentionally and on purpose means to me by re-prioritizin what is important in life. I too love the idea of leaving a dinosaur footprint. Again, thank you for speaking from the heart and sharing your words of wisdom. Thanks all for the response and input on the # of treatments. Got the answer from my RO. She is recommending 25 rads as she will increase the dosage to ensure that 25 = 28. I confirmed that I was fine with the shorter schedule. She also stated the boosts are not needed because I did not have surgery on my breast. She also wanted to ensure I stopped taking vit D, glucosamine and L-glutamine until after radiation as it is not clear how these interact with radiation. Anyone else get this recommendation to stop these supplements? Next steps, creams, soap, soft bras -- anything else? I already use aquafor.",

I am sorry that you had to join us. The ladies here are amazing. You may also consider joining a Chemo thread once you have your plan and schedule. Walking through chemo with others and sharing experiences and suggestions on managing Side effects, etc. was a lifesaver for me. Keep us up-to-date",

I am at the end of my treatment and wanted to connect with others. I still feel many SEs from chemo and my skin didn't fair too well during RADs so at home recovering. Fatigue is the worst for me right now. I worked throughout chemo and just came off work as the RADs burns just didn't bode well with me. So I have at least a month to just rest and relax. Didn't realize how much I needed it. I see a few familiar names after reading several pages of post. I wanted to introduce myself to others and say Hello!

I was in treatment for a year and had to break it out in chunks ie: surgery, chemo phase 1, chemo phase 2, radiation, etc. most importantly let your support group take as much off your plate as possible and focus on you.

I did take a suggestion from one of the posters to ware a t under the bra to reduce the friction. It works Finished treatment 17 today and met with RO. I explained my issues. She indicate most of what I was experiencing is expected at this point. She expressed reducing friction is important and went over her concerns. She takes good notes as she asked me about everything we discussed last week and what I sent via emails or called about on the advice line. Now that is an attentive RO.

I have 4 tats and the only two I can see are the two down the center of my chest. I have a nice birthmark that one is right above and at times I can't tell the two apart. T tat on top I feel as time goes on I will think it is one of many moles that I have. The two on the left and right side I have to be in an akward position to see them. So NO I don't care about my tats when the other scars are a more noticeable reminder of BC. Have a great weekend everyone.",

I switched jobs 9 months before dx. My old companies insurance plan was abysmal. My current employer covers everything, I only have to pay a small co-pay for face-to-face Dr. appts. All other treatment I did not pay a dime. I met a lady at the same center that has paid thousands. We were comparing our insurance coverage. It is night and day. I did run across a lady without health coverage and it took 4 months to begin her treatment. Wow! She was terrified and I would be in her position. Well I have 1 more treatment on Monday. Yes, I have open areas that hurt like the dickens. Using silvidene (sp?) and medihoney for the bad area. And step up the number of times I slather on aquaphor and aloe Vera each day. I have also stepped up the pain meds. Can I yell ouchie. Silver lining -- one more step to the finished line! Yay!",

An example I must be cognizant of LE -- it onset pretty early but with the insight of my RO and help from my LE PT it is being managed. I am determined to get back to the physical shape I was in before cancer, better if I can or close to it. However I know that I must take it slow and no rush. I was a pretty healthy eater before BC but will add supplements. I have a goal to run a 5K in Sept -- maybe not at my record pace but I will run. Like others this journey has changed me forever mentally, emotionally and physically. I plan on using the changes to my full advantage. Main thing I have realized I can not go back to being a workaholic and travel so much -- but that is me (big smile). I will learn to relax more and not be such a go-getter in terms of job, career, etc. I will focus more on what I love to do such as focus on Ministry and outreach to young girls and women and continue to volunteer coaching young girls and women in technology and leadership. My progress: I not only have tender areas in breast, but shooting pains underarm and in breast and restricted ROM in both arms. The silver-lining the breast is healing quickly. Just need to keep up the stretching to keep ROM in both arms. Love all of the smiley faces! We almost have a full board of smiley's. Woot! Woot! And spring is here. Hugs to all! -Angie",

Now the real reason I am posting to this thread.  The CT scan seems to be clear but shows something on my liver and the Drs to conduct another CT scan.The Drs indicate they are pretty sure it is a harmless hemangiona and probably nothing to worry about but they are being extra careful.  Has anyone experienced this?  As each of you know my thoughts are consumed with my DX but I am beginning to feel a peace if that makes since as the landscape has changed continuously over my last few short weeks since DX.  I posted in Just Diagnosed my BC was found through a biopsy of the lymph node.  I show no signs of tumor does anyone have any experience in this situation.  Should the Drs already know the type of cancer from the pathology reports? If I don't have a tumor or does that need to wait until surgery.   My follow-up CT scan is scheduled for Tuesday and my surgery is scheduled for 7/1 since they don't want to do surgery until the results of the CT are known.  I greatly appreciate any thoughts, exprience, words of wisdom and hugs you could pass along.",

The spot noticed on my liver during the first CT Scan was confirmed to be a hemangioma.  Spoke further with the doctor and surgery is scheduled for 7/11.   My DX will be given after final pathlogoy report after surgery as the Dr. indicated information might change and also because I have been labled with an Occut Primary Breast Cancer, meaning there is no tumor to be found anywhere which was confirmed through MRI. Again, I feel shy about posting on Stage IV so glad I found BCO and the support community.   Thanks again all for the support. ",

We had recliners and TV's and privacy curtains if needed. The center also had 6 private rooms. It seemed most went to the \"community\" areas once they were further into treatment on the days that I had my appts. May have been the group of people not sure. There was a patient kitchen with snacks, juice and tea and microwave to warm food or refrig to store lunch. The nurses were great. Warm and friendly. We had good discussions , great books and magazines.",

They have also setup a PT appointment for me on 8/18.   SpecialK, the explanation of your experiences with ALND post surgical symptoms are pretty much what I am experiencing.  I wore longer sleeves  (had not since my ALND since it was so hoooot) and it did help with me not waiting the two parts of my body to even come in contact with each other :-).  The numbness is present in the back of my upper arm and on my back which I was surprised.  The BS Assistant  indicated I probably did not feel  this until later as it sometimes takes a while for the anesthesia and all the numbing medication to ware off and that area to \"wake up\".   The information on each of your experiences and the  link from Carol57 is invaluable to know if I am feeling onset of LE and not the normal ALND issues.",

With this said, I am so happy to have find BCO -- such a wealth of information,support, experiences and just hope to find many virtual friends. I am just starting my journey, surgery scheduled now for July 11; chemo, then radiation.I believe I picked up from the threads that some of you worked during your chemo treatments. Can you provide your experiences - ups, downs, challenges?Not working will be a hard option for me financially and needing to support the kids. At this time I plan on working but not sure what to expect from the minor to the major. I had two co-workers that had BC; when took the enter time offbut indicated she could have worked but choose not to. The other worked the whole time and if you didn't know her you would never know she was going through chemo and radiation. I would like to get other's experiences specifically those that worked during chemo and radiation. Also input from anyone that has children and energy level, etc.I know the reaction is individual but would be great to hear your experiences.",
