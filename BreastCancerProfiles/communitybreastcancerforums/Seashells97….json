I have had 2 rounds of these drugs. I have a PET scan coming up to see if the spot on the center of my chest is cancerous. If it is then the new cocktail will be gemzar and taxol with neupogen for 2 rounds. Has anyone had any or all of these drugs before? How did you respond? To be honest, I am really scared after having read all of the side effects. ",
