I'm taking a targeted therapy drug (Lynparza). The cancer spread to my lungs. I have 18 tumors in my lungs, the largest being 10mm. Mostly, I am angry. When I was originally diagnosed, I was jerked around by so many doctors trying to push things on me that I didn't want to do. They jerked me around for so long, they ended up killing me. My cancer might not have spread if they had done something before my tumor got so large I looked like I had three breasts! But here I am, did chemo for 8 months, double mastectomy and 5 weeks of radiation, for what? Two years later, I am dying. And I am pissed off!",
