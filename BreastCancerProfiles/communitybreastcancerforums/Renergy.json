Mammo was neg but us showed things in other parts of both breasts. Bs is waiting on results of ductogram before going in, hope it's just a papilloma. Bs wants to know for sure as she will biopsy all 3 places.",

Doesn't really matter if you want to or not. The testing is almost as scary as the results. Well really the whole matter is scary. You are very brave and you fight like a girl. How do you like the new \"girls\"? I have friend who recently got her new girls and she said the expanders were the worst, but her new girls are better than her old ones. Best of everything to you.",

You have cancer, cancer does NOT have you. You have been right on top of this and you can bet your docs will fight hard for you. Don't allow anything less. My prayers are with you. Do you have family close to you? They can be a great source of comfort. I have a surgical consult next Thursday, suspect papilloma, will remove and hope nothing else is there. My 2 year old grandson gives me hope and reason to stay on top of this and catch anything bad early. You take care and eat as much turkey as you can. You need your strength. Best outcome is to get it all ....again. You did it once, you can do it again. Someone once told me when you can no longer see the bright side, polish the dull side. You are going to be fine, just some rough times ahead. Hugs to you. Renergy.",
