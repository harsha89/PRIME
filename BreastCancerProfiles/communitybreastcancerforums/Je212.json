Yeah, I know the clusters are considered more alarming......I'm not sure if they were clustered prior to the surgery or not, but they were present.  I understand why they are alarmed at the risk of DCIS (bc of ADH). If you don't mind me asking, how long after your ADH was found did they discover the DCIS?  Was it a separate portion of same breast.....or near area of ADH?  I'm just getting very anxious about the whole thing, because as you know, we are both at high risk, and I just don't know how long I can do the 6 month waiting game.  How are you doing now? In the clear at present?  Thanks for your response. Look forward to talking again.  - Jenny ",

I am new to these forums, and I am hoping to make some friends and also give/receive advice and encouragement.  First, a little of my background.  About 2 1/2 years ago, I started noticing a lump at the 12 o'clock in my LB.  I went to my primary doc, he looked at it and ordered me an US.  At the US, radiologist looked for about 8 seconds before saying \"ok, you're getting a mammo right now.\"  Which was unsettling. Lol. So, did the 3d mammo, and there was an area of spiculated distortion, and a few groups of micro-calcs superior of the distorted tissue, which was the palpable lump.  Next, the needle biopsy showed atypical ductal hyperplasia along with many tissue changes.  So, I was sent to a breast surgeon.  Her plan was of course, excisional biopsy. Pathology came back with ADH, schlerosing adenosis, duct ectasia, and intraluminal calcs.  Except the ADH, I know that the rest of those are considered benign.  Because of the ADH, I was put on yearly screenings.  I just had my first yearly follow up mammo, upon which they found post surgical tissue change (normal).  However, they also were concerned about the micro calcs (even though they were there a year ago).  My mammo report states that I have multiple groups of micro-calcifications superior to biopsy site (not very close to it).  It states that they all vary in shape and size (to my knowledge that is called \"pleomorphic)?  Anyway, after that it says they \"might\" be a result of the excisional biopsy, basically a response to the trauma.  But, they were already present BEFORE the excisional.  So I am a bit confused right now.  Anyways, they put me as a BIRAD-3, and I have to go for another mammo in 5 months to have them checked.  Has anyone ever heard of this happening, or has experienced this personally?  I am just confused as to why the calcs were not a concern before the excisional? Sorry this was so long, but I had to provide the history.  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to hearing from anyone.  - Jenny  ",
