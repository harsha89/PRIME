Tami!   i'm soooo where you are right now.   my drains have been in for 3 weeks and i getting more and more depressed.  i feel like my a$$ has fused to my recliner becaused i was told to do little activity.   my drainage is a little more than yours but i developed an infection at 2 weeks and had to go back on antibiotics so not sure if that extended my time or not.   but gosh i'm praying you get to lose yours!  i too cant wait to take a REAL shower.....and then hit the hiking trail!  it calls to me every single day!   i have an appt next Tuesday so i donned my compression band this morning to hopefully help slow the drainage down before then.   i had the same question tho.....i was supposed to get a fill next tuesday but will they do it with the drains still in?   you'll be able to tell me that when you get back here! good luck hun!      ",
