It felt like it was warm, not hot, but it didn't hurt all the time, but when I touched it, it did hurt.  I thought maybe the inside (lumpectomy) was filling in, perhaps a blood clot filling in there.  I wasn't wearing too tight of a bra for a while.  I did some reading and many recommend a tight fitting bra.  I tried it and it has made all the difference in the world for me.  It seems to support and push the breast together where it needs it and my pain has almost all subsided now.  It might be worth a shot for you.",
