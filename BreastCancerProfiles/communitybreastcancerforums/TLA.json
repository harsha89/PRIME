    "Content": "TLA wrote: I am a 39-year-old female that was just diagnosed with LCIS yesterday; the call from my doctor was informative and unclear.  He said he would be referring me to a surgeon to remove more of the tissue, which I am gathering from what I have read in some of the forums is to see if any else more serious is lurking outside of the what the core needle biopsy picked up.  I have not consulted with the surgeon yet for I just found out yesterday.  I am just wondering if anyone with breast implants has had this done or if it can even be done. I know that it was difficult for doctor to do the needle biopsy for the microcalcification was located close to the implant.  Any information helps.  For I am already nervous of this diagnosis as well as terrified of surgery now that I am older.
