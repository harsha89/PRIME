I remember getting the news and feeling like I was outside my body. Right from the get go I decided to say no to fear and to say yes to hope! I was determined to not let my mind race onto things I had no control over and to take each bit of info from the doc's as it came and process it accordingly. You have a journey ahead of you and it doesn't have to be one of destruction and fear but can be one of hope and determination to leave a legacy of what it means to be a warrior! You are stronger than you know. You can do this and believe it or not you will be a better person when it's all said and done. Breast cancer changes us, and it can be for the better! Stay strong and allow yourself all the emotion that you need to feel. There's no shame, just let it happen.",

I was very fortunate to have my husband be able to come to every (and I mean every!) appointment with me. There's so much information that will be coming your way and a lot of options thrown at you. Your head will spin. I always just felt \"tingly\" in the head! LOL! But my husband was so grounded and I'm telling you, once we would get home I could then ask him, \"ok now what did the doctor say about this or that\". Just if you have someone like that it's so good to not go to the appointments alone.",
