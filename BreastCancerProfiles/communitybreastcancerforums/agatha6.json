My first PT had no clue what it was, my second one told me all about it. Contrary to what the above article link says, she said it is lymph tissue that needs redirected because it has no where to go. She showed me how to manually drain it, she did it for me and it felt great! She said with stretching some people have a \"pop\" and their range of motion returns. Why my surgeon didn't tell me what this was I will never know.  Agatha",

Happy to hear the shooting pains can be normal. Hopeful the lump under the swelling is too. The skin is also itchy. What does everyone use on their skin post rads? I am to use sloe until the two week post rads mark then moisturizer.  Agatha",

My tumor was missed at my first ultrasound due to operator error. Also, when my tumor was found via ultrasound months later, mammogram didn't see it. They even used a small plate on the area where the tumor was and still couldn't see it. I don't say this to scare anyone but to encourage others to push for the testing they deserve based on their condition, as in dense breasts. My case was that I was breast feeding, but also had dense breasts. You can get screening while breast feeding and pregnant.  Agatha",

Dx in Feb. triple negative BC, stage IIb, almost 5 cm tumor, 3 of 22 nodes positive (2 macro 1 micro) smallest margin less than 1 mm. Finished radiation (33 days) the end of Oct. skin is still sore, peeling a little. Some swelling at one end of Mx. scar, shooting pains around there. Small lump noticed above end of scar as swelling decreased. Slightly worried as lump feels hard, previously there was a ridge of bone from my chest wall that protruded a little but can't remember how much. See onc this week.  I hope everyone is feeling good!
