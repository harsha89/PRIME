My BFF and her sons are involved in Boy Scouts and she made a Pinewood Derby car w/ a pink ribbon that says \"For Ginger\" on it and gave it to me after the big race. Friends really do rally around, it seems. My sister though, I know she loves me, but she never calls. She contacts me through Facebook? Her daughter-in-law has brain cancer and has been undergoing treatment for about 18 months now. She's in a clinical trial and the tumor has been shrinking so that's a blessing. They all live in El Paso together in the same house so maybe my sister is \"cancered out.\" Hey Susan... Thanks for informing me about the lung situation. I'm def going to ask about this as I was never told and I have the need to know EVERYTHING. My tumor was in my right breast and I don't have to do anything fancy like you... I get rather bored during my radiation! I know it doesn't take long, but I think a flat screen TV installed into the ceiling would be a nice touch.",

The girls decided that some of my hair that is coming in is  \"colorless?\" I have to agree. There are spots of hair that look like they have no pigment...lol. They also warned me about hair dye... A woman that was coming to RADS was so excited about her new hair that she colored it and the dye burned it all off... They said for me to talk to my Chemo ONC about hair dye and things like that. I see him tomorrow and I'm actually happy I'll be seeing him again. It made him happy that I was always upbeat and ready for the next round and whatever it brought. Gina, I had to look up what a seroma is. I guess it's actually pretty common. I guess your lymph fluid decided to give you a third boob while mine gave me a mild case of lymphadema in my right arm. I hope your seroma doesn't cause much discomfort for you. Rita, you and I have the same fair skin and blue eyes. Today I had 17/28 and my skin is still in good shape. I get a little pink and slap that 98% aloe gel on it before bed. I have begun getting a sensation below my nipple area that some have described as similar to when you're nursing. Oh, and I've been napping every afternoon after work for a couple hours myself except this week I'm on vacation and can sleep in and I DO sleep for 11-12 hours a night!

I don't know if I ever mentioned in this forum before, but I found it then went for a mammogram. It didn't show up in the mammo, ultrasound, or spot compression. This still bugs me. I was adamant that EVERYBODY feel my lump (No, I didn't ask strangers at the grocery store but I was tempted! ;o) ). I'm also concerned about this third week of RADS and getting burned. I have turned a little pink a few times of the 10 I've had, and I'm fair skinned. I was told not to use anything prior to treatments and the one time the NP saw that I was pink she told me to get 100% Aloe Gel or as close to 100% as I could find. Found some of that at The Vitamin Shoppe. ALSO... I am SOOOOO tempted to buy some \"I <3 BOOBIES\" bracelets on Amazon.com and give them to my closest friends to wear. Did anyone read the article about the middle-schoolers (I love teaching middle school for reasons like this! lol) who were wearing these bracelets and a judge deemed it OK for the kids to wear them at school?

I feel great now and lo and behold, my high BP that had magically disappeared for a month is now back! I guess that means I'm normal although I am not well known for being normal. About my hair... The sides and back sprouted rather quickly and seem like the hair is about 3/4\" long. The top front, back to the crown, is coming in very slowly and I just noticed some new sprouting going on there, maybe 1/8\". I look like I have male pattern baldness! It's very fine hair, looks white (or shall I say \"colorless\"?) mixed in w/ a shade of dark, yuck brown. So much for being a hot redhead! Radiation is going OK. Tonight will be my 5th official microwaving and I have only seen a slight darkening and possibly a flattening in one area of my breast. I had a second surgery after my lumpectomy and my surgeon removed a pretty good \"slab\" of tissue to get clean margins. Last time I had a visit w/ him I told him I have names for my breasts now... Pint and Half-Pint! I think I'm destined to wear sports bras for the rest of my life. However, Fruit of the Loom DOES make bras for women w/ 2 different sized breasts! You buy 2 individual sides, whatever your cup sizes are, and they hook together in the front and back! Cool, huh? I have never been very down about this journey we're all going through and I have no idea why. I guess I just battled it with humor. My main concern when I was first diagnosed was how to tell my 13 year old son (my only child). I told him I would never keep any information from him and would always answer honestly any questions he has. This is the same son who reclined the passenger seat in my car so he could hide last night when I was pumping gas w/o my wig on! Yep, children can be brutally honest!

I'm 50 years old and I spotted immediately after my first TC, just for it to return 2 weeks later 2 days before TC #2... LOL. My GYN always said I defy everything that is written in medical books... Gotta ask... This fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, headaches... Is this all common after chemo?",

It wasn't so much about me, but him. Fight this cancer with all you've got! My niece goes to MD Anderson every 4 weeks for chemo, but hers is brain cancer. She also has 3 children and is 31 years old. She is in a clinical trial and has responded well to the treatment so there is always hope. You are in my thoughts and prayers... STAY STRONG! FIGHT!

This past week I have felt like a monkey scratching right beneath my armpit where they zapped me from the right. It DOES feel like it's inside, just beneath the surface of the skin. I have ALL my doctor's appts in August, so I'll ask about this delayed reaction. Glad to be amongst all you survivors! =)",
