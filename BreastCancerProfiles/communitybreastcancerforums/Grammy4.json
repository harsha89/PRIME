Fortunately it won't be warm enough to spend too much beach time but the sun will be stronger being farther south. Thank you!!",

Now starting to curl which makes it look even shorter... No \"bangs\" yet. Ugh!! Often it looks unruly to me and I'm wondering if I should have it shaped ( not sure if there is enough for that) and maybe that would encourage more growth.Seems to have really slowed down... Anyone have a thought on this? I started going without my wig about a month ago.... To me I screamed \"Chemo person\" but my friends said it just looked like a choice to wear my hair short. I just attended a support group last week. Several women were at the same point as me and I have to agree with my friends after seeing someone else. It's very personal when you look at yourself in your own mirror....  ",

Since you have recently been through radiation I am asking your opinion on travel. I have just been presented with an opportunity to go with friends to Florida about a week post finishing. Would you recommend traveling far from home at that point? Hopefully I continue to do well with no skin reactions. thanks",

I must say I was not really tired ( especially compared to chemo tired). my worst issue was intense itching. I used baking soda and that seemed to do the trick. I was also given a product called radioguard. I used that cream 2-3 times each day. Now that I am finished, the area of the boost is quite red but other than that I am minimally pink all over and the itching and occasional pain are not bad. I leave for Florida vacation this Friday. I have purchased rash guard shirts from Lands End to keep the sun off my chest. I also have some new sunscreen. I don't plan on too much beach time as temp will only be in the 70s but the sun will certainly be different that in PA with so much cold and snow. Thank you for your help in this segment of treatment. Hugs to all still going through. You will \"ring the bell\" too. ",

I will chime in on the emotions during rads. I too am ready to decrease the number of doctors. So when the RO said she would be checking me often after rads I just cried so hard when I got back to my car. I wanted to have rads, check that box and move on. I am better now but I would weep at the drop of a hat at the beginning of rads. Now I am on the down slope and the tears are less. When I confided in the Rads nurse she said it was totally normal reaction and many have emotional upheaval at this time due to the fact that for months we were consumed with chemo, decisions, appointments and side effects and now there is a lulled in things which give you time to assimilate all that you have been through.. My MO will start me on Arimadex two weeks after completing rads. So far, I am just pink from the treatments. My place gave me a cream called Radiaguard and I use that 4 hours before treatment, right after treatment and at bedtime. so far so good... thank you all for sharing your experience. It is very helpful. Be safe if you live in the eastern part of the US. The snow is intense right now... ",

That seemed to help. I also have taken benadryl at bedtime. It seems worse through the night. Also the benadryl helps me sleep. Congratulations to those who have recently finished rads. I will join you on Tuesday!! Blessings to all. ",

I finished chemo in late November so had the month of December before starting radiation last week. I agree I was like a \"baby without a security blanket\" during the time between treatments...In fact I believe I had a tough of depression. The radiation nurse told me it was very normal and most women experience that down feeling at the same time. It is b/c we have been consumed with appointments and SE that we hadn't really internalized everything happening .. I am currently getting 16 whole breast and 4 boosts of radiation. Finished # 7 today and feeling good. Thanks for the posts. ",
