My experience is that I was hospitalized last spring with acute liver failure but I managed to survive precisely because of chemo. It saved me. What was hard is that my body was so toxic that I didn't know I was in the hospital, lost six weeks of memory and didn't recognize my loved ones. That in retrospect makes me sad, but it goes to show even with advanced directives and careful planning, you don't always have control of how or when you die. Never felt I was going to die. It just crept up, bang! My question is more about posts of people losing their dignity and being a burden their family. My partner's sister ho had lung cancer was put in a terrible nursing home because she needed more nursing care and it was so awful to visit her there. Most of the time I think it's a miracle any one of us survive hospital or assisted living facilities. No one cares for me like family. But my breast cancer is in my hips and I'm on crutches now, eventually will be in a wheelchair. We've modified the house as much as possible but I'm not sure I could die at home even if I wanted to, just because of logistics...bathroom, eating, bathing. It works now, but my partner can't just stay home and care for me. What are options for a young, disabled person really? I'd love some input (and yes I've read the death and dying issues\" thread already). It's not the moment of death, it's all the time before we die but but can't care for ourselves that I'm talking about. Thanks! Chris",

At 45 I have really missed hiking, and simply walking really. There is so much to grieve for and yes time is slipping away, how am I contributing now? Well, I'm not all the time, but I try to do one task a day. Sometimes it's just hauling myself to the doctor or my support group. A friend in group who was in her last month's was remembering what she enjoyed as a child and took up paint by numbers. I thought that was fabulous. I do some of that, I look at the birds at the feeder, I try and be a good friend and listen more. I play video games, I read, I meditate, I remember to send birthday cards now. Another good cancer friend said screw it, and rented a horse...love that! My very favorite thing is the therapy pool...to feel weightless and soothed. Some days I do stuff, some days I self soothe. But my time to win the Nobel is passed. I'm back to paints and cupcakes and I try to be ok with that. Chris w.",

I personally dont like flowers...i have to deal with them when they die. For stage 4, no books on cancer or dying or whatever...get a gift card instead. Mostly just dont disappear...many friends do because its,all so scary. Deal with your own hangups in therapy so you are freer to support her. Listen, hug and try for practcality and consistency. Give yhe caregivers support and help too! Chris PS its a nice letter, but I find it even more important to hear this in person or with a phone call. Then youll have a chance to listen. Its a courageous thing to get the feedback right away...and it is urgent after all. ",

The side effects, especially fatigue were really horrible, and I usually don't complain about side effects. It's a hard chemo, but if it works try it. It didn't do much for me and I'm back on Gemzar only. Tumor markers are declining. Chris",
