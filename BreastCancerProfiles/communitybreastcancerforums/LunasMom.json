First I'd like to say that these boards have been an extremely big help to me the last seven months & I truly appreciate all the women willing to share their stories & support. I'm 43, mom of two boys without a family history of breast cancer. I've never smoked, I breastfed some, I'm a runner & generally physically active. I started my period when I was 9 or 10 & had an ablation last year for heavy periods. Not a lot of risk factors. My routine mammogram this past January showed I have extremely dense breast so I had an ultrasound done. Long story short, I needed to have needle biopsies on both breasts & eventually a surgical biopsy on my right breast. I've been diagnosed with both Atypical Lobular & Ductal Hyperplasia. I found this forum at that time and was so thankful for all the helpful information. I had another recent mammogram \\ultrasound on the left side which now shows another cyst. Because of the terrible anxiety I went through initially with all the testing & waiting & then more testing, combined with my decision that I don't want to take Tamoxifen, & I'm concerned about my quality of life, I started the process to have bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. I simply can't stay on this merry go round of testing & biopsy. My breast doctor wants to remove my nipples along with everything else. He said there could be cancer cells lurking there which could be a problem. I don't actually have a breast cancer diagnosis at this point.... I'm trying to avoid that. My question to others is am I crazy for wanting to keep my nipples??? From my research, the chance of there being cancer there is miniscule. Losing my nipples for some reason seems so depressing to me. I'm worried about losing such a big part of my femininity. I am concerned about how I'm going to look. It sounds silly, but I kind of went into shock & panic mode listening to my doctor & trying to imagine what I'm going to look like. Any thoughts, perspective, advice would be greatly appreciated.
