Itwas 37.8 (sorry dunno what is in terms of 100s) I also had rash and what i found out that the tempreture was because i develop an allergic reaction. while i was still taking steroids on day 1 and 2 it was fine, but as soon as i stopped the steroids i got temp. it was very unpleasant - i even had to go to emergency to check if i got infection. Anyway it turned out that as soon as i got back on steroids(3 more days) and some antihestamine  for another 7 days - i was fine,- no rash no temp.  ",
