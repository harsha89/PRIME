This morning I received my U/S report showing I had 2 hypoechoic masses. One is 6 x 6 x 7 mm and the other is 7 x 3 x 6 mm. They are at 2:00 and 3:00. I have a birads of 4b. I have to admit after getting the u/s results I am getting more concerned. My sister was diagnosed at 42 and I am now 42. Plus I have 2 cousins and aunt all on my moms side that has had breast cancer. Thanks for letting me share!! Grammasue or HCP have either of you received any results back yet? SpecialK - thanks for the enouragement to reach out to get my biopsy moved up",

I have 2 spots that they said looked solid and wanted to do a biopsy. However, they are making me wait for 2 weeks to meet with Breast surgeon for her to do the core biopsy. Shouldn't I be able to get the biopsy first and then meet with her if it comes back as cancer? Should I push to get biopsy sooner? Thanks for any advice",
