I bought a couple to try on and compare.  The Gentle Touch Coz-eze is the one I think I will keep.  It has a shelf bra that will give me some support for the remaining breast.   The armpits are actually a little big on me, but I think that might be kind of comfortable since I am also having another axillary node dissection.  The one I bought from TLC is very comfortable and actually fits me a little closer.  I really like it but it doesn't support my breast very well.   I also am wondering if I could wear a mastectomy front closure leisure bra from TLC immediately post-op?  I know it wouldn't have the pockets for the drains but since I am only doing a uni-mx and have large breasts, my remaining breast will be SO much more comfortable with a bra on.  Will I have incisions in the area where the bra band would be that would rub or only across the top of my chest? If I wouldn't be able to wear the leisure bra immediately post-op, how long after surgery do you think it would be until I would be able to wear it? I know I asked a lot of questions.  Sorry!! But, I would appreciate any advice anybody can share to help me decide wha to buy.  Thanks in advance for any replies!

My surgeon says that most surgeons really don't like to do surgery on people who have had previous rads because they don't know how well they will heal.  My doctors wanted me to wait to have reconstruction since I have had cancer twice now in two years with the latest being IBC -- so aggressive and likely to recur.  I don't know when they will say ok for me to have the DIEP surgery.  But, after the way I healed after mx, makes me wonder if I should even have another surgery.

Although I have taken off at various times during this so far 3-1/2 year time period since my original dx, I am currently teaching (140 middle school kids).  I come home totally exhausted.  I feel weak a lot of the time and have the typical chronic diarrhea (from Tykerb) every day.  The fatigue is hard and working is just  wearing me out, but I am torn about what to do. My local dr says that because of it being recurrent, he considers me stage IV.  I know that an IBC dx is a pretty poor prognosis.  Everything I read (and I read a lot) says that only 25-50% of IBC patients will still be alive after 5 years.  I hope to be one of the lucky ones but only God knows. I am struggling with whether or not I want to apply for disability retirement or not.   I don't want to work up until the point that I am maybe really sick again and have no time to enjoy retirement but I also feel guilty considering doing this. Anybody else go through anything like this and have any advice for me?  I'd especially be interested in hearing from women who also take Tykerb but replies from any and all will be appreciated.  Anybody know how likely it is to get a disability retirement with a Stage IV IBC dx who is currently -- we *think* --- NED?  (Of course we are all just a scan away from that changing aren't we?) (Applying for it requires me to stop working for 6 months which would mean long term disability again and then possibly being denied.  If denied and have to go back to work, it would put me that much further from my 30 years to be eligible for retirement.  I currently have about 28 years in.   28 years seems so close to 30 when you read those numbers but the fact is that teaching for the rest of this year plus two more years is a lot of time. I am ready to not work but just not sure what to do.  Feel guilty if I quit but also don't want to regret not quitting sooner if I have a third recurrence.) Sorry for so long.  Thanks for taking the time to read. DX 4/08 IDC, ER-, PR-, HER2+, IIB, Grade 3,lumpectomy,2/8 nodes,4 AC,12 wks.Taxol,Herceptin,30 rads. DX IBC 6/09 while still in treatment.

He then took a pair of clippers and got it as smooth as he could.  I then went outside and jumped in the pool.  After that, it actually wasn't that bad.  The anticipation of it happening was much worse than it actually happening.   Same for my mastectomy.  I dreaded it and cried, cried, cried.  But, after it was done, it was ok.  Getting dressed each day is no longer any big deal.  My body has changed, yes, but it is ok. (I had a lumpectomy with first diagnosis, and then mastectomy when I had a recurrence.)  It is now 2 years since my original diagnosis and 5 months since my mastectomy.  My hair is back and of course, not as long as it was, but really cute short.  My mastectomy has healed and even though I have to wait to have my reconstruction, (I had inflammatory breast cancer on my second diagnosis), it is ok.   The beginning of the breast cancer journey is the hardest part.  It will be ok.  These things will pass and you will do fine.  This forum is a wonderful support system no matter which part of the journey you are.  Whether it be learning about pathology reports, getting through surgery, dealing with chemo or radiation or hair falling out or growing in or ............ whatever part of the BC experience you are in the midst of, there are many, many women who have been through the same thing before you who will be there to help you, answer questions, and to support you. Good luck.  Stay around these boards and let all the people here help you get through this.  It will be ok.",

I do have to have it flushed monthly but to me, that is no big deal.  I have to go monthly for bloodwork anyways so I'd be having to go to my doctor's office regardless.  They can flush it and do a blood draw at the same time. I may change my mind at some point and have it removed but not just yet.",

Thanks to anybody for any replies.",

I was originally Stage IIB IDC but was diagnosed with Stage IIIC IBC while still on chemo for the first BC dx and while in the middle of radiation.  All my doctors said no way could I have IBC after all the chemo and radiation I had and especially since I was still in active treatment.  I insisted on a biopsy and I did have IBC much to my doctors' surprise.  I am well aware --- in fact, rarely does a day go by --- that I don't realize how aggressive IBC is and that odds are someday I will be Stage IV.    Didn't mean to intrude, but just wanted to voice my concern over the statement mentioned above.",

So, long story short -- for me, other than the inconvenience and aggravation at times of the rash/acne thing (it even gets on my scalp some), the Tykerb for me isn't that bad.  I hate it when I hear how it makes some women have lots of problems and i feel fortunate that for me it does not.  It (along with the Xeloda, although my doctor thinks mostly the Tykerb) has worked for me.  So, to answer your question, not all women have a terrible time with it.  If you have to take it, I hope you do well with it. ",

I know it is part of the hand/foot syndrome side effect but it is relentless.  When I took 12 weekly Taxol treatments (Sept. - Nov. 2008) I had it to some degree but nothing like what I have had while taking Xeloda and Tykerb from July 2009 - January 2010.  I'm no longer on Xeloda but still taking 1500mg Tykerb daily.  My big toes hurt SO much.  The sides of the nails are swollen and incredibly sore all the time.  I can barely touch them.  I am wondering if it is ingrown.  Both feet are affected but it varies day to day which one is worse.  Right after I quit taking the Xeloda in January, it started improving greatly along with the terrible cracks/cuts on my hands and feet.  A month ago in March, the cracks/cuts on hands and feet started up again although not as severe.  Also, the Tykerb rash which is more like acne reappeared.  (I had it briefly last summer but then it went away.  It seems odd that it would start up again 8 months after I started Tykerb.)  And, especially, my big toes started getting really bad again.  I am SO SICK of dealing with these toes.  It hurts a lot.  When the Xeloda stopped and things got so much better, I thought, finally I was past all these side effects.  Can't believe it started again. Have any of you had a big problem with your big toes during chemo?  Anybody have ingrown toenails as a result of it?  And, if so, did anybody go to a podiatrist about it?  I am scared to go to a podiatrist but know I'm going to have to.  I'm afraid that what he might do could be very painful.  Anybody done this and can share with me what was done to help?

So --- even though everything about my case was always hitting me with bad news, the tide turned and I am now in remission.  Never lose hope.  Just take it one day at a time.  The hardest part is when you are first diagnosed and when you are waiting for treatment to start.  Once your treatment plan is in place, it gets easier and you don't think about BC 24 hours a day every day. Continue to hang out here on the forum and let the women here help you get through this.  Keep us posted how things are going.  Good luck.",

The decision rests with the insurance company that handles your employer's disability coverage, not with your employer.  It is not a fast process.   I'd say go ahead and make some phone calls to get the ball rolling before your surgery next week if you can.",
