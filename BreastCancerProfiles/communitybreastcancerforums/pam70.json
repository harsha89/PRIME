Went for my mammogram in Jan for yearly got call back saying that mamo showed questionable dense mass in right breast. Now i do self breat exams and had my ob/gyn exam in Dec and no lump can be felt. I have no other outward signs on my breasts that i have read about. I am scared that what they saw is cancer by what i have read on the internet about bc. Has anyone has this before that can give me any information. I am going today for a diagonstic mammorgram and am terrified of what it my be. I am hoping if it is bc that is it early stages.
