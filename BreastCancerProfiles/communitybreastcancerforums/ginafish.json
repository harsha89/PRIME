Had Mirena put in in December and noticed a good size lump 2 weeks ago. Doctors say it looks very suspicious and are already treating me as if it's cancer. I can't help but wonder if the Mirena is responsible. Nothing is confirmed yet, but not looking good. I am 38 years old. Anyone have any thoughts on mirena and breast cancer??
