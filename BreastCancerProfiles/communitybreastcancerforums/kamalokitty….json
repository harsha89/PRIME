So far, it feels like its bruised under my right breast, although the skin looks fine. I feel tightening where the tumor was, so my RO suggested stretching, although my range of motion is really good. It helps to do yoga, so maybe I'll add more sessions. I slather the area with Eucerin daily, but I expect the skin will be more affected in the coming sessions. The radiation sessions are very short. I am in and out in 10 minutes. They are very efficient. The hospital is 15 minutes from my house, and then I head back to the park and ride to get on the bus to work. I feel fortunate as I have read that some of you have to travel so far for your treatments. I am still recovering from my 16 rounds of chemotherapy. So glad that's over because it really beat me up. It made me very tired, so much so that I stopped working for about five weeks. I feel less tired now. I think the toxins are slowly working its way out of my system. Still have lingering neuropathy. I'm taking gabapentin and LGlutamine, but I don't think I'm taking high enough doses of LGlutamine to be effective. I'll have 16 doses of radiation and five boosts. I'm looking forward to the end of this process. My hair is trying to come in, but I don't like the way it looks. I shaved it off again the first time it sprouted, thinking it would thicken when it came in again, but no luck. It's very sparse and mostly grey. I'm used to being bald, though, and I don't mind walking around with just a beanie during the weekend. Otherwise I'm in a wig at work, which I'm not crazy about, because it's so hot and itchy. I hope everything goes smoothly for everyone. We're almost to the end.",

I am meeting with my oncologist tomorrow, and I'm just going to ask her, in real numbers, what my prognosis is. I have to know and I have to plan. I just don't want a question mark. If I only have less than 10 years realistically, then I should know that, so I can plan accordingly. I don't mean to be morbid. I just want to be realistic, and practical. As I always have been.",
