I shouldn't let the emotions take control like that! Positive note: haven't had to shave my legs in ever so long! :) Question:  Anyone having any fingernail issues with cytoxin/taxotere?  Or do those just happen with other chemo drugs?",

Flushing is mentioned as a side effect of the Taxotere, but as a thing that happens while it is being administered...so I'm not sure whether to call the MO or not.  Going to the close hospital (45 miles instead of 100 where I get  my cancer treatments) for my Neulasta shot.  If it's not better by the time I'm ready to leave there, I will make the call and find out whatever.  This is a new SE for me.  Also, I have, if not \"chemo brain\", \"chemo fingers\"....

I like to walk a lot (did a half-marathon..my 12th, just a week before I wes diagnosed. If I'm repeating myself, please forgive me.)  Today, 3 days after my 3rd chemo, I felt good that I walked for a half hour!  But I know each day will get better ... until the 4th chemo. And so it goes. But I'm sure continuing to do what we can while we can will help us get back to pre-chemo stage when it's all over. Were you cautioned any about how much to lift in strength training?  I am paranoid about lymphedema and so am being super, extra cautious with the arm on my mastectomy side when I get to the gym.  I stretch it each day with the prescribed exercises, but i don't lift as much as I did before - except for biceps work.",

I ask, because I am triple negative, so Cytoxin and Taxotere seem to be all that is available for me. (Unless the recent discoveries about the link between triple neg and ovarian cancer makes a difference.)  Also, for all of you taking Taxol...it seems to have stronger side effects thant Taxotere has had for me.  Anyone want to comment on that?",

And I hope you are feeling better today. Virginab - I haven't had the courage to go back to exercise class...I stayed with it through the first 2 chemo sessions - that seems like a long time ago!  I just walk a little at home.  Lifeonitside - I'm so sorry your a going through this breakup with DBF.  That would REALLY turn your life upside down.  I couldn't cope without my DH's help.  Although he's gone for an extended motorcycle camping trip...and I told him to GO.  He's had to put up with me for enough.  And this gives me a break from planning meals, shopping for meals, cooking meals,..when everything tastes strange. I still eat the thnigs I know I need to, and ignore the tastes.  (I also still eat the things I DON'T need to!)  I'm fortunate to not have the nausea some of you have had. My ankles and legs are SO swollen.  The MO confirms that it's the result of Taxotere, but I keep remembering that they were just like this before my open-heart surgeries because the valves were not working well.  Surgery fixed that, but I'd guess it's not an option again.  They've probably done as much repair as they can. The MO keeps the cardiologist informed, and I haven't heard from him. It's scary to think that my heart might be damaged from this chemo. The surgeon, the cardiologist, the cardiac therapists, and I worked so hard to get me back to healthy. Well, that's my complaining for today.  Thank you all for giving me a place to vent and whine, so my family and freinds are spared that.  Nat",

Well, ti catch you up to date...6th and final chemo Oct. 30 the MO said \"we'll be done\".  I reminded him that the 1st surgeon said maybe radiation because of not being able to get clear margins all around. Went in Nov. 27 expecting MO to say good-bye.  Instead it was \"the original pathology report was so ambiguous about margins, the radiologist and I have decided you must have rads.\"     Well, ok, I'm disappointed but not too surprised. Met with radiologist, he felt armpit, found a lump he didn't like.  So got marked up for rads, had the CT scan, and went in Nov. 29 to start rads.  Saw the new surgeon first, instead, and she said that the radiologist and she agreed that  the lump needed a further examination.  So, instead of rads yesterday, I had a biopsy and I'm waiting to hear that it was benign. Trying to think positive thoughts.  On a negative note...I had only one lymph node removed on surgery June 6. It was benign. After 5th chemo, I developed lymphedema in right arm and have been seeing Ot/PT for massage,exercises, bandaging, etc.  It has responded well, and am now weraing a sleeve and glove. Expensive, inconvenient, (but not nearly as much as bandaging was). And possibly forever.  It's nice and warm this time of year. Maybe I'll be over needing it come summer.  But, if not, I'll put up with it. Do my exercising in an air-conditioned gym... Still trying to think positibe thoughts.  Nat",

Susan HG - I got a LE sleeve in November + glove.  Wore them every day until late March. The sleeve was working well, but my hand still was swollen. So I quit wearing the sleeve, and the hand is doing better.  It seemed like the sleeve was keeping the hand from draining. Both are still a bit larger than the other side, and I wear the glove about a half-day each day. My support goes out to those of you still experiencing rads and reconstruction. I'm done with rads (that side is still tanned looking but doesn't hurt anymore).  Get a mammogram next month. Wonder if they'll just charge Medicare 1/2 price for doing one.  :}  Nat ",

But my energy level is much improved.  Just came back from 2 weeks at St. George Island, FL where I could enjoy walking outside, and on the beach.  Finally achieved a one-hour walk with no fatigue. Not at my previous pace of 4 mph, only did 3.8 miles, but still...so much better than when I was on chemo.  I've noticed that friends who don't exercise, and who (probably) feel guilty about that, don't want to hear my good news.  Not much support from THEM!  But DH is supportive, and my new friends on this forum always have kind words to say.

Many of you have more to go with different chemos than I take.  I think that's because I'm triple negative...which is a scary thing. There aren't many other drugs to treat me.  But I'll be glad when chemo is over. The Oncologist changed me to a 4 week schedule for my last 2 in order to give my body a chance to make more red blood cells (I think that's what for)..so I wouldn't feel so fatigued. Acupuncture....someone mentioned it...but I can't find the reference.  Any experiences with it?  I'm SO afraid of neuropathy. It would completely change my lifestyle of lots of walking, step-aerobics, etc. But I don't know much about it.  Please let me know what YOU know.  Thanks, Nat",

Headlines on my CNN home page about Cancer Research...targeting lung, melanoma, a blood cancer whose spelling I haven't mastered, and Triple Negative Breast Cancer, which they said is related to ovarian cancer. Glad they have a war on these, but I didn't need to read about a relationship of my kind of BC to ovarian.  Now I have a new thing to stay awake and worry over. DH says I'd be better off if I didn't get on the internet.  He's probably right.  Nat",

L'm not getting reconstruction, and may just stick with the knitted knocker instead of getting a prosthesis.  I've heard that it's difficult to find one small enough.  I'm 3 weeks post chemo - expected to be celebrating.  But, although the lymphedema in the right arm is responding, and I have a lovely sleeve and glove to wear, (a little sarcasm there), the legs, ankles, and feet are still so swollen and painful that it's very hard to walk, and that's depressing.  The therapist said the lymph system got so upset at the continued chemo that it just quit working. I thought I'd had every SE from chemo except nausea.  This was a surprise.",

All they can do is chemo, surgery, radiation. No hormonal treatments. But I recovered well. Well enough to do a half-marathon in May. A little slower walking than I used to be, but I got the 13.1 miles done fast enough that they didn't have to bus me in off the course. :)   So she can look forward to recovery even though she's TN and older than most on this thread. Good luck to you all as you progress. It's good to read some activity on this board.  Nat",
