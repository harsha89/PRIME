      "Content": "Yola wrote: I am 54 years old and haven't gone through menopause. I have had routine mammo's since age 40 due to high density in my breasts. This year, I was referred to a breast diagnostic centre after my routine mammogram showed asymmetry and my diagnostic mammogram showed a cluster of calcifications that were indeterminate, with a mild increase in calcifications from last year. BIRADS 4. Today I went to the breast clinic and they ran more mammograms - 3D and Spot/Magnified, and another ultrasound. The doctor came in and told me that he is 95% sure my calcifications are benign. He said they are round in shape, there are about a dozen within a cluster that is less than one inch in size. He is still sending me for a sterotactic biopsy to be sure. He believes that the changes to my breasts are due to aging. My concern revolves around the fact that the number of calcifications have been increasing over the years. I don't think I can relax until I have a benign path report in hand. I've heard so many horror stories (on this forum and others) about unexpected malignant or atypical cells found upon biopsy. Anyone have an experience similar to mine? Should I take a huge sigh of relief at this point. I'm still pretty concerned about what they might find. Log in to post a reply",

I believe they removed most/all of my calcifications and left a titanium marker in its place for future reference. I am now waiting and praying. They said I wouldn't hear back for one week so I have an appointment with my PCP next Tuesday. Feeling scared and very anxious.",
