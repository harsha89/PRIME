The Fowler-Hilliard hut was one of the 10th Mountain division huts used in WWII to train for combat in the Alps. Highly recommend this organization! They hold hikes and survivor/ patient/caregiver retreats throughout the year. They are free and the volunteers, who have cancer stories of their own, pamper the guests the whole time. They also hold day hikes around Colorado. Love their motto...\"Tell cancer to take a hike\". When I go back to Illinois it may be time to start a low altitude  chapter there :)",

Plus they invited us to hike anytime when camps aren\u2019t in session. We hiked about two miles just looking around. Maybe we need a BCO retreat so we can all get together! oh yeah- it will work for the Live by Living survivor retreat too. Let me know if you\u2019d be interested in telling Cancer to take a hike. I\u2019m glad to coordinate :).",

So good to hear your breathing is better and you are tearing up the pavement on your block. That is great news. Z-I'm glad your daughter is doing okay. A call from school is not the preferred way to get your heart rate up. The lower Ibrance dose helped reduce the fuzzy brain quite a bit for me. The last week on and the first week off it is noticeable, but not the rest of the time. Great job on the run! DeAnn- The smoothie sounds really good! I found some protein powder that isn't whey/dairy. I wonder if you are using a similar product. It is filling and it actually tastes decent mixed with iced water. (Needed to do that to avoid sugar filled Mexican pastries for breakfast this week.) Your work outs are inspiring!! Hi Gracie and Mara and Heidi! Thank you to everyone for the bon voyage wishes! It's been a wonderful trip so far. My friend went home today so now I have five days alone...ahhhhh. I did four dives in Cozumel last week. The day of the boat dive we went to 90 feet the first dive and 40 feet the second. 50 foot coral covered pinnacles rising up from the ledge. Saw a beautiful eagle ray and my favorite blue angel fish. Dove breathing nitrox rather than oxygen and didn't need a nap when I got back to the hotel that night. It has been miraculous. (I have a secret hope that the nitric boosts my blood cells and I get some medicinal value from diving). I'm now in Riviera Maya south of Cancun. Round trip walk to the beach from my room this week is over 2000 steps. They have yoga on the beach and a spa and gym which I'm using. Haven't thought much about cancer this week and I feel stronger. All this energy is either coming from the sun, the blue water, the Mexican food, the daily workouts or the fact that my ibrance break was four weeks:-/. Of course it could also be denial. When I get into my laptop I will send photos. Warmest wishes!!! Let's keep moving    ",

That one is not for me I'm afraid, but I will try the push ups :-) I'm certain that between us we could finish one triathlon!! It may be useful to track how many times we have to \"get up\" during this journey and start over on our fitness efforts. The smallest things, like a cold, that would have been 2-3 days and gone in the past, take forever to heal. Who knows whether it's due to the disease or the treatment protocols. \"Oh white cells...I barely knew ye...\" And we are off again!!!",

My eyes and brain are the only things getting a workout. Decided to do a long hike twice on the weekends since there are 500 hikes in the area. My grandson did the math and says if I do one every day I can get 3/5s of them completed during my six month stay. Hiked Ute Valley Park today and hit 10,000 steps. Had to take a nap :). It's was around 90 when I got home and locked myself out of the house. $125 dollars later I was back inside putting groceries away. Oh well...met the neighbors since I had to use their phone to call the locksmith. Now to decide on the Sunday hike ... Let's keep going!",

My three month consulting gig is done so I'm getting back to more retirement/ disability activity. Sunday DH and i hit the mineral waters at Pagosa springs Colorado and then hiked Wolf Pass Summit at about 11000 ft on Monday Morning. Grandkids arrived for grandma camp Tuesday morning and we spent the day on fossil hunting and geology at about 9,000 ft. Today was zip lining and whitewater rafting. Tomorrow will be another hike if I can get out of bed. Everything hurts of course...but it's so beautiful outside. Good for my soul I think. So good to see you all here",

My husband and daughters were with me when I got the news and we were all stunned. It's been so hard on them and we are all dreading the conversation with the grandkids who are 8 and 10. We are very close and I need to decide whether my daughter will share the news with them or if I should do it.

      "Content": "May 18, 2016 10:33PM - edited May 18, 2016 10:48PM by Iwrite Good afternoon, I've been going to Kellogg since the beginning. The North Shore was formerly \"Northwestern Memorial\" which is university affiliated. The surgeon I saw there, Dr. Yao, heads up all the breast cancer surgery at NorthShore and she came recommended by more than one other doctor in Evanston. She is amazing. They got me in for a consultation within two weeks of my initial biopsy at home and coordinated with plastic surgeons in the NorthShore system. I met with the plastic surgeon as well and felt very comfortable with him. They have the genetic testing group right there and I was able to get that done very quickly...they also help work through all the insurance maze! When Dr. Yao did the pre surgery scans and saw something else, she made an immediate recommendation for an oncologist at Kellogg. If she hadn't seen anything odd I think we would have moved forward with surgery within a month and done that prior to meeting with an oncologist. My Onc. is Dr. Ward, but the others in that practice were ALL recommended. NorthShore is one of the top breast cancer treatment centers in Illinois. (My daughters and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where to go for treatment.) They have offices in Evanston, Highland Park and Skokie so it's convenient if you are north of the City. I called U of Chicago and it was going to take a month to get my first appt. At NorthShore I had a plan and was in treatment three weeks after the initial diagnosis on October 8th. This really helped ease the fear that comes with this. My doctors downstate would have done surgery and never done added tests to confirm the situation...we have no local breast cancer specialists and I think that makes a huge difference. NorthShore is incredibly responsive to patient questions, too! Feel free to message me if you would like to know more. Kathryn",

I kept things under wraps for two years and now disclose it occasionally, if needed. I expect no one outside of metsers to \"get it.\" Actually I've been known to mess with folks when they start going on and on about trivial aggravations in their lives...\"Yeah, it really sucks that someone was annoying you. I'd hate to have problems like that.\" Feeling sick is interesting, Candy. I hadn't thought about how the weird counts impact our feeling of wellbeing, but it makes sense. Sarcasm is seldom the best answer, but some days, that and lower expectations are all I have. Living alone and being retired for the past few months has reminded me how much I fake it with others. I suspect I will continue to fake it with those I love. These days joy comes from being outdoors and soaking in all the beauty around me. Sunshine, mountains, and fresh air rarely disappoint. ",
