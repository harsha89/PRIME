It is similar to the pain people experience with the amputation of limbs. For me my skin felt scalded well beyond the incisional area. This pain had a different character than my first weeks post op pain. In talking with my doctor he explained the mechanism and prescribed Neurotin which has worked wonderfully. For me painkillers did not touch it. I think this problem is part of what is called post mastectomy pain syndrone or PMPS. As yet it is not resolved still requires medication. Best wishes toward your recovery.",
