The microinvasion is a separate entity - it may have different biomarkers than your DCIS. There is an interesting thread that I follow and that may be interesting to you - especially at the beginning. Those women had DCIS with microinvasions that are HER2 positive and still did not have any additional treatments. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/111/topic/748406?page=1 Regarding the chance of recurrance or distant recurrance, you may follow the earlier Beesie's posts - particularly those where she explains why she did not decide for Tamoxifen.
