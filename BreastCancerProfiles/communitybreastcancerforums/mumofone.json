    "Content": "Jun 11, 2013 12:33PM - edited Jun 11, 2013 12:35PM by mumofone I'm another who decided to be conservative with the surgery at first (lumpectomy) but had unclear margins and subsequently needed a mastectomy. My lump was originally estimated at 1.5cm by mammogram/US, but turned out to be larger.Â  My surgeon told me that, while there are no guarantees, there is no difference in recurrence between a successful lumpectomy (plus rads) and mastectomy. He also discouraged me from removing my healthy breast which was my first thought. I'm fairly small chested which helps, I think. Personally, I found the mastectomy healed better than the lumpectomy, but I didn't have reconstruction (and have no intention of doing that). I'm very comfortable with the route I took. Taking it stepwise was best for me. Good luck - and as the previous poster says, take your time :)",
