Take a look.  I have been on all of these and nothing has controlled my liver mets, in fact, on Taxol and Caelyx, they progressed. I was diagnosed with BC in 1999 and due to A C and Tamoxifan I had 7 years clear.  The next chemo by doctor will try is A C as he says I had 6 then and can have another 4 now (as long as my heart can tolerate it).  It is a bugger of a chemo, but 10 years later, I am sure that they have many more tablets to control all the side effects.  Today I am seeing a Professor here in Melbourne to see if I am a candidate for SIRT, I hope I am.  Its not enough, we have kids and families who need us desperately and that is what keeps me going and trying to be positive.  I look at so many people with liver mets who live well once they find the magic chemo or therapy.  I just want to be like them and I will fight. ",
