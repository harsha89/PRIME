    "Content": "char_mp wrote: Hi ladies, Yesterday morning (Monday) while at work, I noticed my right breast was sore and just assumed it was period tenderness, even though I'm still about a week and a half out from the start of my period. When I showered after work, I realized that I have a huge pimple that is \"straddling\" the line between my regular skin and the darker circle around the nipple. It seemed to have a little black dot on top last night, but I think it's larger right now. It hurts to touch. The pimple is darker than everything else and shiny and there is an uneven red patch around it with two (?) hairs in the red patch. This very well could be a pimple, and that is what I'm assuming. I tried putting a baking soda/water paste on it, but it burned my nipple so badly I had to rinse it off. Last week Thursday/Friday I had a large pimple WHAM show up on my forehead, so my body may be just acting up. I websurfed to find a remedy specifically for a breast pimple, since my skin is apparently very sensitive. I couldn't find anything that said it would work right away - I am willing to wait, I guess, but depending on the bra I wear, it can be uncomfortable. Anyway, long story short - this is not an acne post. I want to know if, from y'all's experience, if this sounds like something I should get checked out. My maternal grandmother had breast cancer (treated successfully, no breast removal) eighteen years ago, when I was two years old. My mom's first cousin is currently battling cancer although I'm not sure if it's breast cancer or not. Thank you! I appreciate it! Log in to post a reply",
