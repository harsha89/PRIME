My oncologist decided chemo should not be delayed as I was 6 weeks post op. When chemo was finished I went back in for a full AND. My surgeon was reluctant to do this but my oncologist insisted. I think there is conflicting evidence about what the right thing to do is. My case was discussed at a tumor board at the hospital and surgery was the recommendation. After chemo and before radiation was when the surgery was done. All nodes obtained were negative which was a good thing but also wonder whether the surgery was really necessary.",

An MRI picked up a third tumor in the other breast. Thus the decision was made really quickly to go bilateral. It would not have been an easy decision otherwise. Best wishes",

I was miserable too for 4 months after bilateral and then went for PT and the results of doing many different types of stretches and exercises was wonderful. I was so surprised at how contracted my body had become. I remember those feelings wanting to strip my clothes right after walking in the door everyday. It becomes very tiring and aggravating. Â ",
