TCH for treatments. I have had side effects. Lots of fatigue. Not a lot of nausea, but a dragon has taken up residence in my stomach! No real D but Big C. I have not been able to eat due to reflux. I'm still so weak I can hardly climb stairs in my house. This is upsetting. I have a huge support network and a wonderful hubby! (We think he is having \"sympathetic chemo\"!!) Just hoping that this fatigue lets up. I am an AWFUL sick person.",
