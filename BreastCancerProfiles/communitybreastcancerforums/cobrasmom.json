    "Content": "Sep 2, 2017 08:07PM - edited Sep 2, 2017 08:08PM by cobrasmom I was diagnosed in March with triple negative stage II breast cancer. Began chemo in April. Finished chemo on August 31st. I am having a lumpectomy with breast reduction and lift in both breasts. My surgery is scheduled for October 3rd. I am scared of surgery but at the same time looking forward to putting this all behind me. Radiation will follow a month later. Hoping I have little pain from surgery and my pathology comes back good",
