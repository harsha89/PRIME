It makes your cancer seem much more \"real\" and of course will make it visible to so many others around you. I was in a situation where I had to decide whether or not to have chemo. My MO said she discussed my case with a group of colleagues prior to recommending the treatment. Following are the reasons they recommended chemo when I had an Oncotype score is in the middle (23). I have a high KI67 rate (23), lymphovascular invasion, my ER + % 49 (not closer to 100), my PR + % 44 (not closer to 100), and my age (longer life expectancy). So, I'm going to have 4 rounds of chemo including Taxotere and Cytoxan, every three weeks. I decided to have it done through IV versus a port. I'm hoping I don't regret that decision. I'm just now at the point where I'm trying to plan for my appearance. Today is my first trip to a wig shop. So, we'll see what happens. I'm thinking I might need to get three - so I can be a blond, brunette or redhead depending on my mood!! Anyway, just a thought to try and put some fun in this process. gmmiph - Thanks for all the great information about what to expect and how to prepare for chemo. Knowledge is power, and as scary as it is to be facing the cancer battle, knowing what to expect so you can ask the right questions about treatment helps you make better decisions about your care.",

I've used it a couple years anyway since I have allergies and my nose gets really dry in the winter. It does help. Covered69 - so glad you haven't had an SE's yet, that is wonderful! Summer2016 - glad you made it through your first infusion. Your description of being on an amusement part ride and/or skiing for 3 hours really highlights how dizzy you felt. I was also amazed at how much water your drank during the treatment. I know I've heard hydration is really important....I guess I'm going to need to do a much better job of drinking water. I hope you're hanging in there today since I've heard that day 3 can be the worse for some people. bareclaws - I hope you're now feeling a little better after the SEs you had on day 3 and feel more like yourself and even up for working out a bit again. scaredashell07 - I wouldn't take the anxiety medicine unless it's something you want to do. That in itself can have it's own SE's...especially if you don't already take that kind of medicine. I've tried anxiety meds once or twice and did not like them at all. For me I felt worse take the meds that dealing with the anxiety in other ways. I think Jezikah is probably right that the doctors just wanted to give you the option. I'm starting to get pretty nervous for my first treatment (next Thursday), so I scheduled a massage to help me relax and may also make a point to go to yoga. Hanging_in_there - sorry you had to deal with chest pain and end up in the hospital. I'm sure that was very scary. Glad your case manager explained the difference between bone pain and joint pain. Seems like they should have done that before you had chemo though. Thanks for the tip on bringing Tylenol with you everywhere. Shell72 - glad your treatment went smoothly! Irishmom3 - glad you only had a few jitters during treatment. I hope you're not feeling to bad now that it's been a few days. scaredashell07 - I'll be thinking of you next Friday when you start your chemo. My 1st one is on Thursday... Carolg516 - Two off days doesn't sound too bad. I hope that holds true for you during each cycle. Well, it's Saturday and I'm working at the German Christmas Market (Kristkindlmarkt) in a couple hours. I hope this puts me in a festive holiday mood seeing all the people shopping, listening to some Christmas Carols, etc.",

So, far this has worked for me and I haven't developed sores. I was told to avoid toothpaste with whitening in it, any mouthwash with alcohol or peroxide. So, I switched and started using Sensodyne to brush my teeth. It was much easier on the tissue inside my mouth than the toothpaste I was using before (Aquafresh). So, I think that has helped too. I use Aquaphor on my lips for the extreme winter dryness. As far as exercise goes, I agree with bareclaws and mistyeyes, it really helps to try and move your body at least 30 minutes a day most days of the week. It does help with the gastro and fatigue. I too burp a lot and feel the gas moving around in my system when I get some exercise. This also helps offset some of the constipation you get from the various drug cocktails we're all on right now. Welcome SueIL07 and NotVeryBrave...you've found a great group of ladies that can help answer your questions, provide a shoulder to cry on and just help you \"Get Better Every Day\". Well, I made it through round 3. I am thankful to say that this is the first time I didn't have shortness of breath when they started the Taxotere infusion.....thank goodness. Maybe it's because they actually started it at a two hour drip rate right off the bat and kept it that way the entire time. Anyway, now if the rash will just stay at bay and I don't have to take an extra steroid dose pack this cycle that would be excellent....we shall see. Have a great weekend everyone. It's cloudy and gloomy out today...typical for January in IL I'd say.",

SCGirl50 - I hope you're starting to feel a little better and the antibiotics are helping with your blood counts. DizzyGirl - Glad you're feeling pretty good so far. How are you surviving our deep freeze in central Illinois? So far, I've been feeling pretty good. I worked from home on Friday and plan to do the same thing next week if I'm feeling up to it. Fortunately I have a supportive boss and I have that option. I've had just some minor nausea and have eaten small amounts of food more often like they recommend. I've also really been trying hard to drink extra liquid. I'm gargling with the baking soda/salt water mixture several times a day too to hopefully combat part of the mouth sores. I've been to the gym twice, gone out to eat a couple times and run some errands that were close to home. I am anxious about the delayed side effects I'm expecting such as the nausea and blood count drop. Today I'll probably stay inside most of the day. We're in a polar acrtic zone. Right now it's -2 degrees with only a high of 4 degrees expected. So, I plan to continue working on my Christmas cards and maybe to start wrapping some gifts. Take care everyone. ",

So, I hope you find some friends to walk around your neighborhood with you even if it's just for 5 or 10 minutes. It should really help with your mood. Anything you can do to help you feel more normal should also help ease some of this stress/tension/depression. OhHeyItsDeeDee - Congratulations on completing round one! I agree it's going to be interesting to see how the ladies trying cold capping do with their hair. Knowing myself, I just wouldn't be able to tolerate being that cold for so long. Funny thing I've heard from a few people about their eyebrows during chemo - some of them didn't lose their eyebrows until after all their rounds of chemo were done. Anyway, I'm laughing at the visual of you \"icing\" your eyebrows! Once again, humor is a great stress reliever for all of us! Jezikah - I don't think counseling is ever a bad idea. The diagnosis and treatment is enough to put anyone over the edge. Then when you add in your own plans for a family and the insensitive SIL announcement at Thanksgiving, well that certainly would be unbearable. So, anything you can do for yourself right now to help you fell better physically or emotionally you should do it which certainly includes some counseling. You were very smart though and saved your eggs......so when you do get all this treatment behind you, expanding your family is still in the cards for you! Hazel15 - I'm not having a port installed, but my MO didn't really think it was necessary for 4 cycles of chemo. I did have the nurse look at my veins to see if she thought I'd do OK without the port. If you are having more rounds or have small veins that are not easily accessible it might be a good idea to get the port. I've also heard that some chemo drugs may be harsher than others and a port might be beneficial in those cases too. I'm not positive about my last comment, so perhaps you could ask your MO that question or even check in the November chemo group to see if they know for sure if that is the case. Good luck making your decision on the port. I start my chemo on the 15th and feel like I have my countdown clock going.... Not sure if you want to make your diagnosis and treatment public, but if you do just fill out your profile and make it public via SETTINGS. As we continue on our journey together, its' hard to remember what everyone posts. Just a thougt. M0221 - Thanks for the information about Neulasta. I almost had them reschedule my chemo training...but then it was just another appointment where I'd have to schedule around work. So, in the end I just kept it the way it's set up.

I've heard that exercise can really help minimize some of the side effects. Yikes - when did you start the steroids? Certainly you were bummed with weight gain so quickly.",

I just had my second round of Taxotere and Cytoxin on Thursday. I couldn't sleep that night so felt pretty out of it (dizzy, tired,etc.) yesterday. Anyway, I did manage to drag myself to the gym and walk the track for 30 minutes. I think the walking really helps aid the digestion and get the drugs moving through your system better. I have to say it's a bummer about your taste buds and the fact that chocolate no longer tastes right. On my first round of chemo I didn't have a Nuelasta shot but have to start getting them now since my WBC got so low the first time. So, I'm kind of anxious to see if I get any side effects that people talk about (bad bone pain). What has been everyone's experience of SE's with Nuelasta? I feel much better this morning since I was finally able to sleep last night. Unfortunately I think my allergic reaction to the Taxotere is already starting up again so will probably have to start taking a 6 day dose pack of Methlypredinisolne (steroids). The good news is at least I have the RX in advance this time so maybe the horrible rash won't get as bad as before. I still have some hair left but not much. I had my husband cut all but an inch of two off all around on 1/2/17. I'm still amazed every time I comb it how much hair comes out when it doesn't seem like there is much there. I've been lucky that my scalp hasn't had too much discomfort, but my hair was already fine and not that thick. I wore my wig to work and out and about town after the new year and got a few compliments from people I didn't know too well. So, when they asked if I had a new hair style I just said yes.

It makes it tougher when the family is not in tuned with what the future treatment options might hold (or cannot accept them). Take a deep breath and try to have your list of questions ready for the MO. I see from your signature, that you have IDC so your cancer is invasive. Do you know the % of your tumor receptors ER/PR +? The closer they are to 100%, the easier it is to pinpoint your treatment. So, if your hormone receptors are say 50%, then something other than hormones also feed the cancer. Ask your MO if they did an Onco-type DX test on your tumor. It helps tell if chemo will decrease your chance of cancer recurrence over a 10 year period. Good news that there was no cancer in your lymph nodes. Did you have any lymphovascular invasion (channels to the lymph nodes) in your breast tissue. These items can impact the need for chemo. scaredashell07 - I have IDC like you with no lymph nodes positive. Even though my tumor size was small, there were other factors that made chemo potentially helpful for me. For example, not everyone's tumor hormone receptors are really high - close to 100%. So, that can be a reason chemo might be a good idea. In my case, mine were 49% and 44% (ER/PR). Also, I had lymphovascular invasion (microscopic cancer cells in the channels to the lymph nodes). So, with that even with rads (required since I chose a LX), can I really be sure all the microscopic cancer cells will be killed. I also had the Onco-type DX test done. Once again, I was kind of in a gray or middle area as far as whether to have chemo or not. So, I had to make a decision what to do. It was really tough, but in the end, I just couldn't ignore the potential benefit of having chemo if it helped reduce my chance or recurrence.",

Is your pain in you heels and toes from the Nuelasta or the chemo drugs? The other SE I get from the Taxotere infusion is shortness of breath when they start administering the drug (within 5 to 10 minutes). This of course is scary. So, then the nurses have to stop the IV drip and give me some saline and wait a few minutes before they start the IV back up. I also have to use a really slow drip rate. During my first infusion the shortness of breath was a lot worse than the last time. Since I was expecting it, I didn't get near as anxious and the nurse showed up quicker.

I've never been that much into sweets, but oddly find myself craving them more since starting chemo.

That's great news that the additional tests showed the cancer has not spread. No doubt very overwhelming and emotional. Deep breathes......inhale, exhale slowly. StayMom - my chemo starts the day after yours - Dec 15. I'm not getting a port although I did ask about it. My MO thought I'd be OK getting treatments through IV since I'm only having four rounds.

For me, the prune juice has helped stay regular and other than feeling bloated and crampy in the mornings, my nausea isn't too bad. What's driving me crazy is the rash. It started on my back Friday afternoon. Now it's spread to my arms, shoulders, hips, chest and thighs. I have a follow-up appointment scheduled for Thursday for blood work, etc. So we'll see if the MO gives me anything for the rash. For now, I'm using Benadryl cream for the itch and am going to take a Benadryl tablet too. Anyone else having similar issues with a rash? Oh, I can't remember if I told everyone, I'm participating in a clinical trial at my cancer care clinic. The study of 3,600 US patients (90 from my clinic) hopes to improve the information around the protocol to prescribe certain medicine to people receiving chemo. The study is trying to find out if an automated system should be used to help doctors determine when to prescribe colony stimulating factor (CSFs) medicines in order to help reduce a patients risk for febrile neutropenia (condition involving a fever and low number of neutrophils (type of white blood cell)). I think the most common CSF used is Neulasta. Anyway, in my test group, if my MO does not agree with the automated systems recommendation to use a CSF, she does not have to follow the suggestion. bareclaws - That's awesome news! I bet you couldn't get out of the hospital quick enough. Jezikah - glad to hear you're embracing and rocking the GI Jane look. I'm not sure I'm quite there yet....although I did think GI Jane was a bad ass! scaredashell07 - my mouth feels strange occasionally. Have you tried eating some frozen fruit or hard candy? Also, be sure to gargle with the salt/soda/water combination - it doesn't exactly taste good, but is supposed to help prevent mouth sores. Hang in there everyone. I agree with StayMom, I\"m glad I have the Christmas distraction and extra holiday activity to help keep my mind off my health.",

The APN told me that the rash I have is a reaction to the Taxotere. So, she'll need to talk to my MO, to see how to tweak my upcoming infusions which could mean a lot more steroids. Also, she said that I'll end up getting a Neulasta shot which I did not have with my first infusion. So, I am slightly bummed that now I am supposed to avoid crowds of people and was told not to go to my gym since they consider that a germ factory. Oh well, c'est la vie. ",

Had a great time with DH enjoying the holiday lights and other sights and sounds of the windy city. Several of you have been talking about icing your nails and feet if on Taxotere. I haven't heard of doing that before. I did just notice last night that the skin underneath my fingernails is starting to look a bit raged - very dry and cracking. Also, when I touch my finger tips, it leaves little indention's that don't pop right back our immediately. That seems really weird. Question for anyone who has not gone through menopause yet. I started my period right after my first chemo treatment (as expected). It stopped after a couple days (as expected because mine are really light). But then it started up again a few days later and has lasted now for 9 days. Is this normal? My MO did say that chemo would put me into menopause.....Anyway, just wondered if anything similar happened to anyone else. My hair has started falling out quite a bit the last couple days. My hair is very fine and was already thin, so I'm not having any discomfort in my scalp. I'm still not ready to shave it off but think I'm going to have to soon. So, I'm trying to decide if I should do that as part of NYE. I think my options, probably need to be one of these three - (1) shave it today sometime, (2) shave it when the clock strikes midnight, or (3) shave it sometime tomorrow as my start to 2017. I think for me it's going to be really emotional and I can't decide. Boy, I listen to myself talk about this and it sounds so pathetic. I'm glad that several of you can now check another round of chemo off your list....that's one less treatment until you get to the other side! Congratulations! Happy New Year everyone.....2017 is going to be a better year for all of us! When we get through our various treatments, we will all be stronger more resilient women!",

It was described to me as I had microscopic cancer cells in the channels that lead to my lymph nodes. So, the cancer was not in my nodes, but probably would have been if I had been diagnosed later. So, the presence of LVI is why I needed whole breast radiation and I could not have bracytherapy type radiation. Having LVI was also a reason I opted to have chemo (I was in a gray area of needing it based upon my Onco-type DX score). Irishmom3 - what drip rate is your MO using for your Taxotere infusion? Have they tried slowing down your drip rate? Because of the reactions I had with Taxotere (extreme shortness of breath), I received my infusions over a two hour period versus one hour. This really helped me and I was able to tolerate receiving it I am still having extremely watery eyes and the tears just drip down my face constantly throughout the day. I'm really looking forward to this going away. I have finished chemo (Feb 16) and just had my marking session and simulation for rads this week. I expect I'll probably start radiation sometime the week of March 20. Just a tip for everyone who has the muscle aches, etc. I recommend massage therapy. I had a massage treatment every three weeks when I started chemo. I would have it the Monday before my Thursday chemo treatment. It was helpful for some of the muscle ache issues. I'm going to go two weeks in a row this time, because I won't be able to have massage therapy for awhile once I start rads. .Hang in there everyone....one step closer!",

RoseRN1 - sorry to hear you had issues on your dry run. That is frustrating. The machines do have issues from time to time because sadly they are used so often. I have been stuck on the table like you a couple times during my course of treatments. The rads techs had to call in the engineer to help get the machine up and running again. I was fortunate they were successful though so I didn't miss a treatment. I hope your dry run goes better today. Hugs",

If anyone starts having pain from the radiation burns, you could try a mixture of half Alocane (alocane.com/) with the cream you are using to moisturize your breast/underarm area. I use TriDerma radiation cream with aloe and alantoin(https://www.triderma.com/radiation-skin-relief.htm...) It has helped me with some of the pain. I just picked up the Alocane at Wal-greens. Also, for those of use wondering about deodorant, I use Alra a non-metallic deodorant that contains aloe.

You could also consider having protein drinks for extra calories and nutrition. Your doctor is probably concerned because you have lost quite a bit of weight.
