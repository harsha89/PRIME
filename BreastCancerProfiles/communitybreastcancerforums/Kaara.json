When you have your app't you should explain how much stress this waiting has caused and that you do not wish to be \"put on hold\" like this again.  If you don't like this doctor's response, get another doctor because you will be dealing with this person through surgery if that becomes necessary.

I've learned in my research that use of thermography for detecting early breast cancers is a good diagnostic tool because it shows small areas that cannot be seen on mammogram, and there is no radiation involved.  In the future, I think I am going this route.  If something is suspicious, you still have to do further evaluation, but it is good for early detection.  Bad news is most insurance doesn't cover it, but I would gladly pay out of my pocket to get a safer test. ",

While I am not a vegan, I do follow an alkaline diet, and since starting it, I feel much better and have more energy.  I wanted my body in optimal condition as  I certainly intend to do surgery for my breast cancer, and will wait to see the outcome of the sentinel node biopsy before deciding on any radiation. My point is, the diet your friend is on is not going to hurt her condition, and can only help it, so try not to panic about that part of the program.  ",

The more information and education you have the better you will fee.  Just going on this forum has helped me tremendously in dealing with my concerns Dale Carnegie gave some advice that I swear by.  When you are faced with a challenge, prepare for the worst possible outcome and how you would handle it...once you do that, you will be able to face whatever challenge life gives you, and most times, it isn't that bad at all.

One thing I would add....doing nothing should not be an option.  If you are going to avoid conventional treatment, then you absolutely must follow an anti cancer diet and supplementation program which takes a huge committment of time and money.  Insurance does not pay for holistic or integrative treatment in most cases, and the cost of eating organic is about 30% more than eating conventional...sadly!  ",

Your treatment largely depends on your age stage and grade of bc.  Yours is low grade with no node involvement, so you have a wide range of treatment options.  I assume that you are post menopausal because you are being offered aromasin therapy.  It is the more powerful of the two recommended therapies...the other is tamoxifen, which doesn't have such an impact on bones and heart.  Do your research on both, but there is a study that I read on this site that says that post menopausal women with very early stage bc might do better on tamoxifen for several years, and then switch to aromasin for the remainder. I'm 71 and  I decided to go that route with my treatment, because, like you, I didn't like the SE's reported by those taking aromasin. For the record, I opted out of rads because I couldn't get the type I was interested in, a five day version of partial breast external beam which radiates only the surgical site.  I have made dramatic changes in my diet and am taking loads of supplements to boost my immune system so that it can fight any recurrence.  I\"m being monitored by an integrative physician who is also giving me weekly vitamin and antioxidant infusions.  Frequent follow up exams will be important and necessary. I wish you all the best with your ongoing treatment.  Once you decide which therapy you want, there are threads you can join with women who are also on that therapy and you can get advice on how to best handle any SE's.  Actually, I have found that some tolerate the hormones very well and have few if any SE's, so don't assume you will automatically have them. Sending you prayers and positive energy!  Stay in touch! ",

Did you have a biopsy?  If so, you should have a preliminary grade and stage as well as receptor status.  You should ask for a copy of your pathology report which will tell you that.  It is very unlikely that your tumor is late stage since it can't even be felt.  Mine is early stage, under one centimeter, and is HR/PR ++ HER2-, which means it is less aggressive.  It's driven by estrogen, so I was immediately taken off my BHRT.   There is another thread that you can go on called December 2011 Surgeries.  Many women who are having surgery in December are on there communicating and it is very helpful for those of us who are still awaiting that day. One thing you want to do is follow a good nutritional plan, keeping starches and sugars to a minimum, and sticking with complex carbs (fruits & veggies and protein)  Studies have shown that cancer feeds on sugar, so you want to eliminate it as much as possible.  Make sure your Vitamin D levels are at or above the normal level of 60, as it boosts the immune system.  There are many other supplements that are beneficial, but discuss that with a nutritionist.  Some of the breast clinics have them on staff and available for consultation. Keep calm and use your energy to focus on getting through the surgery and healing process.  This site is full of wonderful people who will help you through this challenge. Sending you prayers and positive energy. ",

The way I am approaching this is if I don't do radiation, there is a 75% chance that the bc will NOT recurr.  Are those 75% odds good enough for me, and will I be comfortable knowing that I have protected my heart and other breast.   With my diet and lifestyle changes which have become a huge committment for me, I think I am increasing those 75% odds by quite a bit, so right now, I'm leaning towards not doing rads.  I think the biggest disappointment was when the RO told me I would have to forego all of my antioxidants during treatment!  Why...because the antioxidants that protect the good cells in my body could possibly protect the cancer cells as well???  So, now I have to give up everything that I've worked so hard to achieve over the last three months for a treatment that at best is questionable in my mind as far as its effectiveness.  I am going to be talking to my BS further about this at my app't on Monday, and will be interested in his response.

Do I go ahead with the rads or take a risk that it won't return and pull out the big guns the next time if it does?  There are no guarantees either way,  I will have to decide over the next week, as time is running out for me to start treatment.  Does anyone know the longest time you can go before starting rads? ",

Palm at the time and nowhere near the Cleveland Clinic in Ft. Lauderdale, so they got me an emergency visit at the CC in W. Palm.  I went rushing over there not knowing what the heck was going on, thinking I'm going to miss my surgery on Monday!  The cardio guy checked me out and made the determination that I am ok for surgery, so he gave the clearance.  I could be really mad because they did the initial ekg last Monday and could easily have called me in during the week, but no, they waited until 3:00 PM on Friday to do it! Gurrrrr!!  This is the most stress I've had since the dx!  Home now and exhausted from the stress of running around downtown W. Palm Beach looking for a place where I've never been.  If I didn't have a heart attack then, I guess I never will.  Hope this is all the murphy's law stuff until I get through Monday and surgery!

Good luck on Monday...hope your results are the best! Chrissilini:  I know I wouldn't want to get a cold right after surgery.  Have your father stay away from you and wear a mask in your presence.  Not too much to ask to keep your health.  Have some good sanitizer in the house to wipe down things he touches.  Wash hands frequently and load up on vit C...that's the best you can do.  Good luck! ",

Eve...I know you're getting nervous about your surgery...I was on pins and needles.  I would revisit with my BS the exact reason he wants that other breast removed...there has to be a logical reason.  I went to my integrative physician today and of course he is not a fan of radiation.  He isn't going to tell me what to do, but he did outline a program for me to keep my bc from recurring.  I am going to take weekly infusions of antioxidants, as well as some oral vitamins.  He even suggested mistletoe injections which come from Germany (discussed in Suzanne Sommer's book Breakout) but they are very expensive (about $250 per mo) and not covered by insurance.  He's doing more blood work to determine if I have cancer cells floating around and a heavy metals test to determine if I have any metal toxicity.  Also getting a thermography test to see if other breast might have some early signs of bc growth not yet detected by mammo.  It frequently happens that we get cancer in the other breast.  I left feeling confident that I am doing all that I can do to keep this bc from returning.  I still have to decide on the radiation but I have six to eight weeks to make that decision. I am going to relax now, recuperate, and enjoy the holidays and the cruise we have planned.  This other stuff can wait until I return, but it's good to have it lined up. ",

We're getting ready for our cruise that we planned on the spur of the moment to celebrate my clear margins and nodes!  Leaving on New Years Eve and sailing for 7 days in the caribbean.  We're going to work on the art of doing absolutely nothing!  We'll sleep late, have a light breakfast, hit the gym, lay by the pool, read, or walk around St. Martin or St. Kitts.  After that, dinner, a show, and maybe some dancing, depending on how we feel.  Absolutely no accountability to anyone but ourselves...not even going with friends this time, because that can get hectic trying to decide what everyone wants to do. DGD #2 is havig some difficulty with DGGD's daddy, so I am going to let her and baby stay at our house and house sit while we're away.  This will give them a cooling off period so she can decide what she wants to do.  I don't want my precious GGD upset by any of the nonsence that her parents are dealing with. I see my BS on the 29th for a check to see how I'm progressing.  Also have an app't with my integrative doctor to give urine samples and have him draw blood for my toxicity testing.  After the first of the year, I'll start my vitamin infusions (Meyer's cocktail). Hope everyone had a nice holiday with friends and family, or just enjoying a quiet day of relaxation. ",

All the best to you....I pray your score is on the low end of the scale and that you have the a positive outcome from treatment. ",

Honestly, I don't even tell them what I'm doing any more because I don't want to hear their BS!  I just go so they can check my boobs and take my blood.  I just do my research and do what I feel is right for my body.  I hope that the accupuncture works for you...what a relief that would be.

Ducky:  We have the same dilemma with buying in bulk, but you are so right...the supermarket prices are at the gouging level these days, and it's no better in NC!  I don't have a problem now with the produce we buy in bulk because if I don't use it, I put it in the vita mix and make a smoothie to drink, or a soup, so one way or the other, it goes down.  They have a Fresh Market here...can only imagine what that is going to set me back:(  The price we pay for eating organic. Today I'm going to attempt to start an herb garden under a tree off my kitchen...we'll see how that goes.  Probably I could buy the herbs at the store when I need them for much less, but it wouldn't be as much fun now would it?

We won't necessairly lean our \"fate\" the day of surgery.  The tissue still has to be sent to pathology for a complete analysis, which sometimes takes a week, so don't be disappointed if they can't give you a definite answer the day of surgery.  Maybe preliminary if they do a frozen section.  My BS is not doing that so I will have to wait.  Just remember...it is what it is....can't change that, so begin to focus on treatment options, etc. My surgery is tomorrow, so I am working on getting my gift bags done for all the kids and friends so I have one less thing to do when I get home from the hospital.  It is keeping me focused today, which I really need!  Kids are coming over later to visit, so that will take up more time.  We're going out for a good dinner since I will not eat all day tomorrow before or after surgery.  It's better that way, so you don't run the possibility of getting sick.

If I had been as young as you, with an onco type score that high, I definitely would have made a different decision.  Only you can make that final choice about what is best for your body.  Do your own research regarding the pros and cons of radiation on someone your age with your grade and stage of bc.  Whatever decision you make will be the right one for you. As for the tamoxifen, my BS tells me that it is the better option because it not only protects the diseased breast, but the other breast as well as for distant mets.  I am definitely taking that with little or no SE's.

Today I'm having a big clean out the freezer cookout for BF's kids.  We want to cook up all of our meat left in the freezer before we head to our summer home in NC.  Too many power outages and threats of hurricanes here in Fl to leave stuff in there that could spoil. ",

My journey is long from over as I am just beginning the hard part, post surgery treatment with tamoxifen.  I am going to go into it expecting few SE's.  In spite of the recommended dose, I am going to start on a lower dose to see how I tolerate it and then step it up as I go along.  If I can't tolerate the lower dose, then I will know it's not for me, and will need to take another path. It's all a crap shoot IMHO!  I'm looking forward to that cancer vaccine seeing the light of day in time to help us all.  I think we're on the cusp of a new era in medicine...it is now being recognized that the body's immune system is quite capable of killing off disease, so now we harness that power and let it do its job!  This is the premise of the new cancer vaccine and I love it. ",

Surely you don't wish you had never gotten the mammogram.  Ignorance may be bliss to some, but it would only be for the short term.  Sooner or later you would have had to face bc, so better it be at a time when it can be treated, never to return.  Remember I said to you in an earlier post \"It is what it is\"..you can't control or change what has happened...just have the right attitude going forward, and make the right decisions for your health.  You can't do that if you're constantly worrying about all the things that could go wrong. I think the assisted living facility is a great idea for you.  It's nice to know that you have skilled help nearby when you need it, particularly when you're living alone.  A lot of people in our community in NC have gone to these type of facilities and they are very happy.  No worries!

The MO visit was uneventful...my prognoss is excellent with an oncotype score of 13, so all he recommended was tamoxifen.  I asked about Metformin and he sidestepped the issue, said he wouldn't prescribe it because it had not been studied enough, but that I could probably get it from my PCP.  A real outside the box thinker, that one:(  If I had a real need for an MO it wouldn't be him!

I've also been living with this challenge since September and it is very draining.  I've held myself together for the sake of the family and my boyfriend who hates to see me stressed out.  I've been without my BHRT for the first time in 20 years and that is taking a toll on me as well.  For the first time ever, I'm starting to feel old...well....I am 71, but I didn't feel 71, I felt more like 40.  I'm sure hoping this funk will pass soon and I'll be back to my old self. Sorry ladies...I really have no right to complain.  So many of you are going through so much more, and I should be comforting you instead of feeling sorry for myself.  I send you all prayers and positive healing energy! ",

I'm over 70 and didn't really want to have radiation, but after careful consideration and talks with several RO's I have decided to go with a shorter version.  I have the same situation...early stage, small tumor, clear margins and nodes.  I don't want to deal with this again in ten or twelve years when I might not be healthy enough to withstand more treatments. I have changed my diet and lifestyle and am taking supplements to further prevent the recurrence of bc.  I feel I'm doing all I can do, so now I am just going to live my life. ",

I still remember the prayer that my DS and DIL did for me, asking that God take the tumor away \"as if it had never existed\".  When I heard those words from my RO, it brought back that prayer immediately!  Is it possible that I have been healed and do not need rads at all...I know prayers work, but I've always prayed for others...never myself.  I have a lot of thinking to do over the weekend, before I have to begin treatments next Wednesday. ",

I felt it was an overkill for my low grade early stage bc, and I opted out.  You have even a lower stage (0) and very small, and it's DCIS..not invasive.   You are concerned about mets.  Radiation will not protect you from that...it only protects you from having bc recurr in the same breast.  The anti hormonals like tamoxifen protect you from distant mets. I wish you luck on your decision..it is never easy when we're weighing risk against QOL. ",

First and foremost, it is not a death sentence like some cancers are.  There is a 98% cure rate if it is caught early (this is why we get mammograms every year).  There have been many advances in treatments to the point that even if the disease has progressed, there are ways to keep it in remission for a long time. Getting on this site is a great first step.  Google your type of BC and read everything you can about it, the treatment options, etc.  When you meet with your surgeon, you should be armed with as much information about your options as possible.  I have watched too many of my friends just let the doctor make all their decisions for them, and they are basically ignorant about their disease and what to expect.  Is your surgeon a BC specialist?  If not, I would probably want to get a second opinion from a BC specialist.  I am meeting with my primary care doctor next Wednesday to discuss a plan to go forward, but after reading all the information, I have decided that I will request the breast MRI prescription, and have it done at a BC Center that is near our winter home in Florida.  If surgery and treatment are needed, I will be close to my family for additional support. Sending love and support your way, and wish you the best possible outcome. ",
