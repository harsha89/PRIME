Well, I'm back from everything is here's what I know: I have two areas about 6 mm each, one \"looks\" round, posterior of left breast, around 9:00, and the other very close next to it has undifferentiated borders as far as they can tell. The lesions are near the chest wall, but not right on it or anything. The ultrasound was inconclusive b/c really only the diagnostic mammogram gave good pictures. The radiologist actually came into the room and helped the ultrasound tech with the ultrasound b/c no matter what she did she couldn't get a clear picture or even find the lesions or whatever. So the radiologist explained to me that, because the ultrasound was unclear, based on the dx mammograms, that my doctor will definitely want a stereotatic core biopsy done by a breast surgeon (the radiologist has worked with my gynecologist in the past and knows his routine) especially given my extensive family history of breast cancer. He showed me my previous mammogram from 12/2013 and pointed out that, as I was younger, my breasts were very dense and fibrous whereas now that I'm older and menopausing my breasts are much clearer and are just fat and tissue. The radiologist said the lesions may have been there back in 2013 but couldn't be seen b/c of the fibrous nature of my breasts. The radiologist also advised me to be sure I get two opinions. So my doctor's office was closed this afternoon so I won't know anything else until next week. I am definitely going to get copies of everything when I see the surgeon (who happens to have his office right across the hall from the women's center where I had my mammogram done.) Any advice? And thanks for all the support so far. MerGrey Log in to post a reply",
