I cryed and was so afraid. I decided the only way to go was up the ladder and do't look back. I started taxol and advastine Oct 19th 2011 and I am on trail SL I get pt/ct every 9 weeks not many side affects from the advadtine, that one is pretty much a breeze. The taxol gave me nearopty in my feet, and I have no taste buds which stink because I love cooking and baking. My last scans were Nov. 13, 2012 and NO EVIDENCE OF DIEASE so you keep you head high because you to can be NED or stage. Never give up and if you start to feel sad STOP YOURSELF and say to yourself it isok to feel this way but I am going to live my life and not let this crap get the best of me, an go do something that will put your mind and body in good spirits. Go for a walk, make a phone call to someone e who is a positive person, go bake a cake, hug your kids if you have any, hug your pet if you have one. I have 3 small dogs and I have to tell you next to my kids the are the bes thearapty in the world, they just love you so much. Read a book, visit a thrift store, take a car ride to a park, but always try to think positive. The drs. So far are calling me a 7 time miracle, and I love it. I volunteer to feed the hungry, so I saw to myself these people are here for food so if I think I have It bad I don't, I talk only positive to all the people and give encouragement to hem all and they know that I am stage 4 and if I be be positive so can they and that makes them also be positive, sorry for any typos, it is 3 am in new York and I am so tired, I have to get up at 5 to start my day, I was 't going to type but just had to tell you to be positive. As cindella said \" even miracles take time\" so don't you forget that, g Of bless you :-) and smile, every day you wake up and take a breath is a good day :-)",
