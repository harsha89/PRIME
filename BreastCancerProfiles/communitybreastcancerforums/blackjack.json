I also had a lumpectomy in May and I started radation 6 weeks after surgery. I think it depends on if you need chemo which I did not need. I interviewed 2 rad onc before I decided which one to go to. I waited the 6 weeks because I personally could not deal with the thought of radation to my chest. I have lung issues and radation only made it worse for me. If you read more post there are women who have minimal side effect from radation and do very well. I think everone is different. I don't know of any places in NJ, but I would recommend going to a large univerity hospital who has the most up to date xray machine. You may want to ask about mamaosite if you are a canadate which is given x2 day for 5days. Hope all goes well and get us posted on your progress. Blackjack",

As I sat in the ER with breathing issues and chest pain the nurse wanted to take my BP on my left arm for comparison. I had a lumpectomy and SNB on that side. I said NO and she told me my onc said it would be ok. My poor right arm is so bruised from BP's, blood draws and IV's that sometimes I think that it maybe ok to take a random BP. What are your thoughts about blood draws on the affected side? I do wear a sleeve at times. Just your thoughts..... BJ",

We can develop reactions to rads that are given to us.  I developed every side effect there was from rads since day one. The first tx I had I developed burning in my left breast as if someone put a hot poke inside of me.... then 3 days later I developed an asthma  problem. Then to top it off I developed a rash all over the upper part of my chest and neck area. They told me that I was in the sun to much..no I was house bound most of the time because I was soooo tired and fatigued. I had to go on steroids and pain meds for the rash and burnt breast. Oh and yes I now have lung damage from rads. So, please if you have symptoms let them know asap and keep telling them until you feel satisfy with your tx plan. Everyone experience's rads differently and my case was the extreme. Just wanted to share this as the SOB and chest pain you are feeling is real. As Shirlann says: the breast cancer, the gift that keeps on giving. Have a great evening Remember be healthy..be happy Blackjack",
