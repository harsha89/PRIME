As several ladies have pointed out on these forums, if you have a lumpy first, you can always have a MX later. If you go ahead with MX, your breast is gone forever. I had a lumpectomy and then bilateral reduction from G to C and have been very happy. Only missed a week of work. Listen to your doctors, get a second opinion if needed, and do what feels right for you",

My plastic surgeon left the cancer side a little larger to compensate for that and then it didn't shrink.Â It is not noticeable in a bra or in clothes. Have you had an appointment with a plastic surgeon? My breast surgeon recommended one and we talked about what he would be able to do. They were both in the OR when I had my surgery. I had very little pain and only took a week off from work. They told me I could drive as soon as I was off pain medicine but I didn't take anything stronger than Tylenol after I left the hospital. I had the surgery in the afternoon and went home the next morning. Let me know if you have any specific questions.",
