TriciaM Trust ur Gut.  The docs are human.  If they are not ? then mistakes are not found.  I know in my job I make mistakes it is just not life or death. Port Blood Draw A trained RN/DOC/PA must draw normally a RN will do it.  If every go to the ER tell them too they can do it there also.  Or for surgery Also if you have to have surgery again DONOT remove it before hand unless you have to. Elen I love my wine to Hair loss anyone yet I have not lost any Maryah I felt the same way before chemo up until the night before My husband and I went out for a really nice dinner We had a great bottle of wine the conversation was light we came back I fell a sleep and the morning of I woke up and was great ready to go,  My husband on the other hand came unguled.  I never talk to him about how he felt about me have to do Chemo.  We always talked about the kids and me.  Looking back we need to talk about him too.  I had just started feeling good again the week before I had Chemo from my surgery and he was able to return to work full time and have his life back.  He was about to loose all of this again.  In his eyes the chemo was going to be the worst of every side effect possible.  I normally have really bad SE from meds. I have done really good.  Just know we are all here and you can talk about what every it my be from BM's to jobs we all get it.",

I take calcium 2 times a day I take vits and iron I drink a protain drink if I can't eat ( at least try)  I eat all green wise items... I have been doing this expect juicing for a while but I was a vegatrain for 11 years and still eat very little meat mostly fish that we catch and is fresh.  I make my foods at home I don't eat processed cookies and bread If I don't make it  I buy from the bakery.  I have changed something up like I don't buy milk in the glass bottles with the cream on top and I am not using honey and am not eat raw fish/sushi.  I asked about all the food stuff from The ACC and they said not unless my WBC gets really low and they but me on a no VEGGI and FRUIT Diet.  I can even do Sushi and oysters 3 days before to 3 days after chemo.  Just as if I can have my fills then for my TE. or dental work.  They have said that as along as the doseing is done right and with pre chemo meds the side effects should be small.  I must say I have had very little side effects.  I have been really tired one day but I was still able to go to a all day birthday/football party.  I have not been eating my normal amount and some days really did not eat.  But I have been up everyday makeup on dressed and going.  I am a very busy person though.  I pass kideny stones don't take pain meds and keep going.  So as I said I am a bit crazy.  I don't pretend to be normal.  I live with a kideny issue called RTA and I have had a stone all ready with my first dose of treatment.  I am sure I will have one with every dose,, I pass 2 or 3 stones a month.  I have Great local docs that are friends.  Great local hospitals that husband/friends run and work all through (navy and civilian).  I will say my husband is having a really hard time I am the one that is all ways on top of things. I always have everything under control and no mader how bad the stones get I always make sure  it fits into the families schedule. This has to be about the cancer I can't hide anything and he knows how bad it really is.  He does this for a living.  He knows what it means when they say a lymph node lite up or it is this close to the muscle and skin, there is a leason on the liver and it is ok for now.  The tumor is growing at 1 CM a week.  It looks like your family history is...Syndrome and we need more info.   I had a bad infection/rejection of a TE and had to go back into surgery and was in the hospital for over a week at UAB(5 hours a way from home) this set me back 3 weeks on chemo.  I think we all have hard times.  Times we can't get out of bed times we can't eat, when we think we can't go on.  I know I have never been as sick as I was as when I had the infection I was sleeping 18 + hours a day not eatting and hurt so bad that clothes/sheets wind hurt.  At first my husband blew it off and said I was fine I must of cought something.  So please know we are all different no one is the same the way my body reacts is different then anyone elses.  When it comes to radation I am not getting it because the my cancer protacal does not call for it at this point I was schedule for it but I do not have it in my skin muscle or lymph nodes and it was less than 5 CM and I am Pre menapause.  and I am ER and PR + my ONC is one of the top research doc for susan g we really looked to find my team of docs.  I drive 5 hours by choice. I have to run back to school then meeting for work I hope if you are having a rough day you can find something that makes you feel better I take lots of warm baths with obus oil ( from the health food store) first learned about yes in England.  I wish We could get the Migrane med here in the states  That would sure help with the aches....",

It drives me crazy and yes I can say my skin worse from Chemo.  As the week has turned into almost 2 my skin is what is showing the signs.  It first started in my finger tips.  I have the tape on from my port placement that will not let go.  It is day 9 I will beg my husband to remove it tonight as it is getting red under it.  He will tell me know that it will fall off.  The round and round of living with someone in the medical field if he just new less.  Madhatter Welcome Junebug is right There leave for this and for our family to be able to take time off the sad thing is they don't have to pay you but SS or other areas may be able to help with this part.  We are all here for you I hope you have great results. Sfrey I am glad U are great I am on day 8 and I had very little down time.  I also work from home with my own CO's  one I can do what I want when I want.  I take clients as I want to.  I Advocate for special needs children.  So I have not been taking many of those case where I have to go into IEP's  The other A friend and I hold events for Non Profits.  Are next one is in March called Perdido SpringFest it is a Fair and the profit goes to 4H.  I am lucky in regards to this expext when I don't work the CO doesn't make money and neather does the NON profits.  I am also not taking the shot I asked and my doc said he is giving me everything I need at the time of the infuision.  I feel great and full of energy no bathroom issues eating and sleeping.  So I am happy at this point.  I didn't like the feeling the night of my chemo steriods were strong.",
