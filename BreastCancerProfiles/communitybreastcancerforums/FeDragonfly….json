Today I had my \"spot\" check mammogram (microcalsifications). Became frightened when she (the same sweet lady that did my first mamo) asked me to wait so the radiologist could read this to make sure I don't need any more films. As I sat there with 4 other ladies in our designer gowns (sans bra) 2 were asked to have more films or worse (in my mind) an ultrasound. I thought to myself \" I just know I'm going to need an ultrasound. I  Text my worried praying hubby in the exterior waiting room that he probably needed to reschedule his afternoon meeting.  I kept waiting and waiting. .  . The sweet lady finally came back and told me the radiologist wanted me to see a \"breast specialist\" my heart sank. I honestly do not remember anything she said but I do know I was so thankful to have her there with me (it seemed each of us had our own private tech). Another thing I am so thankful for was the young woman (in scrubs) sitting beside me, still waiting to hear her results, says to me..... Dr.Martin is the best!! Well, it would have been Mid-November to get in with this Dr. Martin.  So, I agreed to see his partner. We walked out to schedule and see my hubby. All I could do is cry. I have said all this (Please excuse this babbling shocked crazy woman) to say this..... WHAT NOW? The sweet lady (can not remember her name) told me the surgeon may want to do a needle biopsy. If there was anything else.... I do NOT remember. I just learned my mom has been given a grim dx. with a 2-7 year life expectancy & my oldest daughter just had our 6th grandchild (he's only 3. Weeks).  I haven't told ANYONE but my hubby. I don't want to worry anyone needlessly. I just need educated..... So I can make informed decisions. Thank you in advance. I'm in shock. This has all happened so fast. I understand the need to get it taken care of earlier than later but golly..... I feel I'm in a whirlwind.  Log in to post a reply",
