My op was 16 years ago & I had a lot of itching & sensitivity over the first 5 years as the nerves healed. In the last few weeks I've been having physiotherapy on my neck & shoulder & low & behold the itching is back along with a feeling of tightness in my breast! It's such a familiar feeling & I can only presume that the physio has upset the nerves again. I still have numbness under my armpit & the back of my upper arm & shoulder. I had a lot of trouble with swelling in my arm 3 years ago too. Heyho - it's a long job!",
