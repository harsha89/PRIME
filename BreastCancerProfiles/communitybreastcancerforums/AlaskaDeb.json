One thing to think about....If you show up at the emergency room of a hospital with a good cancer center, and present with scary symptoms....headache, blurred vision, fainting etc, and tell them you have a confirmed brain met you can sometimes work it into immediate treatment as an inpatient in the hospital.  Legally, once you are seen in the ER the hospital has some culpability if you go home and have a problem, so they will want to make sure you are being treated appropriately. I have know 2 different women who have used this avenue to get treatment jump-started.  One had advanced liver mets and couldn't find an onc who would treat her because she had no insurance.  The other one had lung mets and felt her doc was dragging his feet because she had Medicaid.  Both got treatment. Just a though... Good luck Hugs Deb C",

OK...we have the beginning of a plan.... I had my phone conference with my Oncologist today.  I need to have a brain MRI, a spinal tap and a PET scan done next week.  They are going to try and get that done all in one day up in Anchorage.  It will take a few days for the results of those scans back.  In the mean time I am going to have the surgery to get a port placed here locally.  My Oncologist is petitioning my insurance company to see if they will approve an experimental drug called Avastin.  If they will not approve it, they will try and get me in a clinical trail for the drug.  It has been approved for other types of cancer, but has not received FDA approval for breast cancer yet.  If we can get the drug approved, we will start a combination of Avastin and a single agent chemo, hopefully in 2 weeks.  I hate to wait that long, but medically, it really doesn't make any difference....I'm just impatient. I am still wigged out about the possibility of the cancer being in my brain or nervous system.  I am hoping and fervently praying the MRI and spinal tap will come back clear. We went to church this morning and Pastor Randy let everyone know what is going on.  We had a giant tear-fest.  I know I will get a lot of support and prayers from everyone, but it is really hard TELLING everyone.  I hate seeing the shock on everyone's face.  It makes me feel like I have failed somehow...I know, I know...it's not my fault...but it is still hard.

I wrap at night when I need to and wear a sleeve about 3 or 4 days a week during the day. I have almost no more swelling. My new problem is in my trunk. I have had some minor swelling in my back and in the fat �dog ear� left under my arm after my surgery. In the past it has either gone away on its own or with manual LE massage. I came down with a nasty case of shingles that ran around the bottom of my ribcage, all the way from my backbone around to my belly. The shingles are almost gone (thank God), but I now have quite a bit of swelling in my mastectomy area on the cancer side. A seroma that had almost disappeared seems to be filling up again. I have a lot of general redness and some areas of the scar are swollen to the point of tightness. I saw my PCP today. He called my surgeon who is 150 miles away and we had a conference call. They are going to do an ultrasound to see what the seroma is doing. They both think the swelling is LE, but neither of them really �treat that�. My PT who is a LE expert is also 150 miles away, so I am kind of on my own. I can do massage on my arm myself, but how do I massage the chest??? I am SO sick of all the reminders of the cancer. I just want to be done with all this crap. It may be a month before I can see my PT�Any ideas for me???

I had my second spinal fluid chemo yesterday.  I can honestly say I am getting more than a little tired of twice a week spinal taps.  I also got my regular Abraxane chemo.  I am off the Avastin for the time being.  I have been having really bad nausea that was not being controlled by the regular nausea meds.  Yesterday I got a drug via IV called Aloxi (sp?) which got rid of the nausea.  Thank God for who ever discovered this drug.  Puking gets really old after a few days.  I have also been having really intense headaches when I move around very much.  I still have bad double vision when I have both eyes open, but I am getting a little more used to wearing the eye patch. This is really the most disabled I have been since this whole thing started.  I am wobbly when I walk, can't see straight and I have been forbidden to use sharp objects, hot things, or the good china!  LOL  I am a walking accident waiting to happen. Are you tired of my whining yet?  ....On to the plan.... The chemo I am getting in my spinal fluid is called metholtrexate.  I will be getting it twice a week until further notice.  After I have been off the Avastin for a few weeks I will be going to Anchorage for neurosurgery.  I will have a type of port called an Omaya (sp?) reservoir placed in my skull.  They will drill a small hole through the top of my skull and put a catheter down into the ventricles of my brain.  Then the reservoir will be right under the skin of my scalp.  That way they will be able to fill it with the chemo without doing a spinal tap. The docs assure me that it is a simple surgery....I'm not convinced yet, but I trust them and I sure would love to quit getting the spinal taps....so I guess we are going forward. We had a good time at the fair last weekend.  I was pretty sick, but I was able to take a walk around a couple of times and see the kids ribbons....they did great as always, lots of grand champion ribbons.  I spent most of the weekend resting in the camper. I'm sure I am forgetting something, but what's new?  I will try and update soon but reading and typing are hard right now.  Thank you all so very much for the e-mails, cards, flowers, meals, and mostly the prayers!  I hope my vision improves enough soon for me to respond to everyone in person, but please know all your support is very much appreciated. ",

When I got there for the PET I had to drink about a quart of the lovely barium gook, on a queasy stomach.  From there, things started to look up.  The nurse who injected the nuclear contrast was a wiz with the needle and got me on the first stick.  They gave me a xanex pill because they want you kind of dopey and calm. I took a nap for an hour waiting for all the contrast to get where it needed to go and then spent about 45 minutes in the PET scan machine. John and I just hung out in the car....actually, I reclined my seat and slept for 3 hours while john read.  The Xanex really knocked me out. My Dr's appointment had mixed news.  My PET scan showed a wonderful reduction in the amount of cancer in my bones and lymph nodes.  I would say at least 75% of the cancer is gone, maybe more.  The spot on my liver is gone too.  The only slight negative is that there seems to be a bit more cancer in the lymph nodes in the center of my chest...all in all a very good report. The flip side of the coin is that my oncologist is quite sure that the vision problems I am having is the cancer in my spinal fluid.  I guess that it is sometimes very hard to find the actual cancer cells in the fluid.  She said that my symptoms, combined with the chemical changes in the fluid and the fact that they found large cells that don't belong add up to the cancer being there.  She said about half of people with this type of mets that has not progressed very far are really hard to diagnose. SO...unless the labs come back from Mayo today totally clear, we are going to presume I have mets to the spinal fluid and start treating it this afternoon. The treatment involves getting a spinal tap, drawing out a bit of fluid and then injecting the chemo directly into the spinal fluid.  I will be doing this twice a week.  I have to go off one of my chemo drugs, Avastin, (It can cause bleeding during surgery) for 4 weeks and then they will be able to do a neurosurgery to install a reservoir for delivering the drug directly into my skull.  I'm a little freaked about the surgery, but it certainly sounds better than getting 2 spinal taps a week. So, I am a worn out camper today, and it sounds like the fun is just beginning.  Please keep the prayers and good thoughts coming.  ",

They are saying that the cancer is metastatic to the lymph nodes...that means it has moved out of the breast to the lymph nodes under her arm.  Does that help at all?

SOme other things that help me: Eat very small amounts every half an hour....even just half a cracker to keep something in your stomach. If food really does not appeal to you try some of the nutrition drinks like Ensure.  My grandma had problems with eating and we made her milkshakes with chocolate ensure and icecream.  She was able to sip those and get some calories down. Eat what ever food sounds good, even if it is not \"healthy food\".  If you think potato chips might stay down, try them.  Have you tried ginger tea?  It helped me.  Some people swear by gingerale.

I guess sometimes that causes these false images.  The X-ray scared the crap out of me when I saw it...it looked like a solid white lump in my lung...too spooky. Anyway...I guess this is just a case of being glad it was all nothing!  Thank you for all the prayers and good wishes.  Also thanks to those who sent up a prayer of thanksgiving that things are OK....I think sometimes we forget to say thank you for answered prayer....I'm still saying thanks :) :) Hugs Deb C",

We still have no real answer to what is going on.  The tests for bacteria and virus have all come back negative.  The second test looking for cancer at Mayo clinic found nothing.  The chemistry of the spinal fluid says there is a problem, but there is no clear reason for the bad vision problems.  Thank God I can still see close up, I just can't be on the computer long or it makes my head hurt worse... ANYWAY, my doc has been on the phone with cancer centers in 3 states and he thinks the most likely answer is early mets to the spinal fluid.  He said that for some reason the cancer cells sometimes like to cluster around the brain stem and cause a lot of visual problems with not a lot of cancer being present.   SO, we quit the anti viral and antibiotics since nothing showed on those tests.  We ran full CT scans; neck, chest, tummy and pelvis and nothing new showed up.  The brain MRI is clear.....so if there is something growing it is still really small and maybe just in a bad place.  Since we can't figure out what the heck to treat I asked the doc if I could just come home for the weekend and rest and he agreed.  The plan is to have a phone conference with all my doc's on Monday, get me an appointment with a ophthalmologist neurologist in Anchorage, have a PET scan early Wednesday morning, and then maybe squeeze in another spinal tap somewhere in there too.  The docs at Mayo said if we got a larger spinal fluid sample they could spin it in a centrifuge and maybe catch enough cells to get a definitive DX. So for now it is time for some sleep in my own bed.  Please excuse my typos tonight....too tired to correct.  You have no idea how much all your prayers and good wishes on all the threads here mean to me.  They got me through both nights.  I would read a few and then close my eyes and rest. More tomorrow Love Ya Deb C",

I am just so tired and disheartened.  I am on a crap-load of drugs because they don't dare NOT treat some of the possibilities, but it means I have to stay in this damn hospital.  I am trying so hard not to have my DDs get scared, and here I am scared to death myself.  I am making my husband stay home with the girls because they need at least one of us they can count on, but that means the nights are way too long here.

I went in this morning and everything just went SO well.  I got right in.  The tech did a great job and got the IV started in one stick, a minor miracle in itself with my sucky veins.  The nurse was SO nice.  I was kind of leaking tears the whole time.  She was so kind.  When the scan was done I asked if I could please meet with the radiologist and they said they would see.  They got my husband and introduced us to the doc, who is a temp contract person, so I didn't know him.  I told him I was more than a little bit stressed so he said we could read the films right then. He took us in an showed us the  X-ray that started all the problem.  You could see an oval spot right next to my spine that was clearly not there on the x-ray from last year.  He said there was no way to tell if it was in the lung or actually attached to the bone from just an x-ray.  He went through the whole cat scan with me...took about 15 minutes to explain everything.  He said there was nothing that looked even remotely like cancer.  The cat scan actually didn't show any type of structure where the spot was on the x-ray.  There IS a bunch of degenerative problems in the bones of my spine in that exact area.  The doc said that sometimes makes almost a shadow or halo next to it on a regular x-ray.  He is fairly certain that is what caused the \"spot\".  The cat scan went low enough that we were even able to look at most of my liver, which was also totally clear. What a relief!  I can not thank you all enough for the support, information, understanding, hugs, prayers, and help.  It meant the world to me last night.  All of you are going through problems of your own, but you took the time to hold my hand.  It really made such a difference.  I Love all of you Deb C",

My dad is a pharmacist and I call him Doctor Dad.  He is the one that always gets my panicked 2am phone calls when the kids are sick.  I am a worry wart and I always jump to a worst case scenario.  If my kid had a fever they were not teething, they had spinal meningitis and were going to be in the hospital before morning.  If they were coughing I was worried about pneumonia...you get the idea.... Anyway, he is always very patient with me, but he has a saying:  If you hear hoof beats, think horses not zebras.  In other words, think of the simple easy answer first. I know how scary side effects are.  Two days ago I was sure I had lung mets.  The week before that I was sure my bone mets were growing like wildfire because my back hurt. Hang in there.  There is probably a very simple not cancerous reason for the cough Hugs Deb C",

The tap was odd.  They did an awesome job and I was not in pain, but when they got the needle in it felt like someone was letting pressure out of my head....like Ahhhhh...that feels better.  I knew that couldn't be a good sign.  Anyway, since we are still not sure what is growing in the spinal fluid they have started me on a strong anti-viral and several antibiotics.  That will cover the bases until all the pathology has a chance to \"grow\" and be identified.  The earliest would be tonight, but most likely not until tomorrow. I was one sick puppy on Tuesday and yesterday, but I feel some slight improvement this morning.  I can sit up with out feeling bad. Luckily I didn't get a spinal headache at all.

I have a port that is low on my chest, just above my mast scar.  It is a bit deeper than standard and you need to use a 1-inch needle instead of a ¾ inch to get it to lock in good.  Since this nurse had not accessed my port before I told her that she needed to use a longer needle.  She gathered up all the tubes and stuff she needed for the blood draw. Let me preface this by saying that every nurse I have had says my port is awesome and easy to access.  It has always been a one-stick procedure with no problems.  So this nurse disinfects the chest area and starts poking around ABOVE my port, where the tube runs up to my vein.  I told her the port was lower and pointed to it.  She felt there with her finger and said \"no, no, no\" and started poking up higher again!  She is from another country, so I didn't know if she understood me or not, so I said it's lower than that.  Right then she poked the port needle about an inch above my port into my chest about a ½ an inch.  I yelped and she pulled it out saying \"sorry, sorry, sorry, I missed it!\"  Well DUH!  You were nowhere near the port.  Now she is sopping up the blood from the bad stick with gauze and feeling around again.  There is small amounts of blood on her fingertips, on my chest and on the needle.  She started feeling around again and FINALLY finds where the port is.  I asked her 2 times to get another needle and she kept saying \"did I hurt you, oh Shh, Shh, Shh\" Like she was trying to calm a crying baby or something.  I told her, that yes it hurt, but it wasn't a big deal, I just wanted her to get another needle and redisinfect the area.  She wouldn't listen to me.  Just then I basically sat up in the chair to keep her from poking me with the dirty needle and my regular nurse walked in, was horrified, and took over. She disinfected everything and had the blood in about 15 seconds. I guess everyone is allowed to have a bad day, but this is a nurse in an infusion center that couldn't find my PORT!  And was willing to stick me again with a dirty needle.  I just found it very unsettling and asked to not have her do anything for me again. So....what do you guys think?  Did I overreact?  She is a really nice gal, but very hard to communicate with because English is not her first language.  Deb C glassylady41.spaces.live.com/ Dx 2/29/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 27/32 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The lowest I remember my AN going is .3, but it bounced up the next day to .5 and climbed from there.  I have never been in the hospital for low white counts.  In fact (I should be knocking on wood here) I have not been in the hospital at all with my chemo. If my AN goes below .7 or so I do one neupegon (sp?) shot and that usually brings my counts up enough to do chemo the next day.  I have only had to do that twice in 5 months. If my AN goes below 1.0 I try and stick to the diet the doc gave me for low counts: no fresh veggies or fruits unless you can totally peel them, no active culture yogurt, no blue cheese...things like that.

How the heck am I supposed to move on when I am wrapped up like a mummy and have to explain to everyone I see that, no, I didn�t break my arm?? Wrapping my arm is making me nuts. Maybe I�m just not too good at it, but I either get it too loose and it slips down, or too tight and I have to unwrap the whole thing and do it over, which take 20 minutes when I have to do it by myself. How in the world do you guys keep you fingers wrapped? If I use gauze it spools off the end of my fingers if I try and do anything. If I use that non-sticky tape stuff, as soon as the swelling goes down a smidge, it comes off like a loose glove. The only thing I have found that works is to wear a large surgical glove with the tips of the fingers cut off over the gauze, but that makes my hand hot. Grrrr�.what do you ladies do? I can�t just sit around. I have to use my hand! I won�t even get measured for a sleeve until the 9th. I don�t know if I can stand this wrapping that long. If I sleep in the wrappings it makes me feel so claustrophobic I have to take an ambien to get any sleep. I can�t even sleep with socks on� I�m sorry to whine, but this is really getting me down. The thought of having to do this forever makes me nuts.

It looks like it will be about 2 weeks until I can see the ENT, so of course, now instead of thinking it is just something like mouth sores, but in my throat, I am worrying that it is some kind of mutant throat mets.  Deb C Who really needs to quit borrowing trouble..... glassylady41.spaces.live.com/ Dx 2/29/2008, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 27/32 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I think this is such a hard question because even the best medical minds DON'T KNOW the exact long term results of the blood boosting drugs.  For me, I have had a conversation with my doc and we agreed to only use procrit and neulasta when totally necessary to avoid me missing chemo, and then we will only boost me the smallest amount we need to to get to low normal levels. I was making myself crazy with the different studies that seem to say directly opposite things. ",

I also got the number for the \"risk Assessment\" office at Providence hospital.  I think that number should be listed under \"Don't sue us please!\"  The woman totally kissed my butt, but I have no idea if anything will come of it. So....no big actions, but I feel like I have done something. Since I am off my celebrex due to not taking anti-inflammatory drugs before surgery, I am having a heck of a time finding something that takes care of the headaches and muscle pains, plus when I am in pain it is a lot harder to control the puking.....TMI, but welcome to my world.

Leave to me to declare a \"hooky Day\" and then wake up at 4am!  Both of the girls are sick; Katie has a nasty cold and Carol is still recovering from the stomach flu, so I told them to stay home and rest today. I looked back over my last few blogs and they are depressingly similar: \"poor me...blah, blah, blah....this hurts, that hurts, this part of me seems to have quit working......\"ad-infintium.  Even I'm sick of reading it! My goal for today is to spend some time recognizing that, yeah, My day may not be perfect, but parts of it are still pretty wonderful. WE had a beautiful day yesterday.  It was crisp and cold and really smelled like fall....kind of like wild berries in the woods and snow in the air with a hint of smoke as people fire up the wood stoves. My chemo went well yesterday.  We did my regulard Abraxane and the Metholtrexate in the poprt in my brain.  The pressure in my CSF was normal (it was high during surgery, so we will be checking it for a while)  We also slowed down the infusion of the chemo in my head because I had been told it might help with the vomiting.....woohoo....it did J While I was getting my chemo yesterday, a good friend of mine, Denise, came by to visit which is always nice.  Unfortunatly; she also had some bad news about a mutual friend Margie. Margie's sister lives in Florida and has just been diagnosised with cancer for the third time.  I don't have a lot of details, but the tumor is large and spread in her abdomen and is interfering with her renal system.  One of her kidneys is at risk.  I will have more info soon, but please keep Margie and her sister in your prayers.  Margie is trying to get things organized so she can go down and be with her sister. I also found out that my Uncle (really 2nd cousin, but we always call him uncle) Jerry Bradford has Lung cancer.  The last I heard yesterday they are planning on removing one lung.  Please keep the whole family in their prayers. I know I owe dozens of people thank-you notes and phone calls.  Please know that as soon as I can actually write a note without such a ridiculous amount of effort I will try and catch up.  I really should get the kids to take a photo of me typing....I sit in the recliner, pile blankets on  my lap until the screen is level with my nose, wear my eye pactch on my left eye with +3.50 reading glasses over them( the strongest I can find) I set the type size to 28, stick my arms out to the side like chicken wings and practice my hunt-and-peck.....I think it may loose something in the description, but I look like a true dork ;) OK....I fear that a lot of this willl look like it has been typed by a drunken monkey.  If it is really making all my school-teacher friends crazy, please feel free to pull out a red pen......feel better?",

One thing I thought was really interesting is that there have been several small studies done that seem to show that people with colon cancer who are on Avastin have some relationship between the effectiveness of the chemo and the level of rash they get....The people that got the worst zits had the best response to the chemo!  i hope that correlates to breast cancer response....I wouldn't mind the bad zits as much if they meant that the drugs were working.  I don't think I saved the links to the studies, but I found them surfing on Google for side effects of Avastin. One other thought....I had to go on zithromax a couple of weeks ago for a bad sinus infection.  It totally got rid of the nasty zits!  That kind of lends some credence to the staff bacteria idea.  If I would have known I would have asked for a script months ago.  Good luck Deb C",

I have posted all my woes with my forms�them not fitting right, hating the bras, pressure sores on my dog-ears�. blah, blah, blah� Well after wearing my lightweight forms in camis for about 4 months and not being happy with how I look (though it is very comfortable) I decided to give my expensive silicone forms another try. I wore the things 2 days when one EXPLODED while I was wearing it! Mine are Jodee Sincerely Lite forms. They are the lighter weight silicon forms and the �skin� split open in a Y shape across the whole front of the boob and began leaking all the whipped liquid stuff out! What a mess! And of course I was in a meeting and the damn thing was practically disintegrating while I sat there�.Grrrrrrrr! My fitter is only open 5 hors a day, when she happens to get off the butt and open the shop. I was hoping to never have to deal with her again, and now I have to deal with this. Can you tell I am more than a bit angry?? Does anyone else have these Jodee forms? Have they ever broken open while you were wearing them? I have a bilat mast, so if I get something different I have to get both of them, but I really don�t want to replace this one if they have a habit of freaking BLOWING UP. I am beginning to feel like the whole industry that makes and fits these forms is a scam to get even more money out of us. I wish I was brave enough to go flat�.

I have a spare my DH is mailing me, but now I am wondering if I should leave it off for the return flight?? I have not lost or gained weight, and the sleeve still seemed to fit fine�I don�t know what was causing the pain. Has anyone got any advice? I have flown 3 times before with the sleeve with no pain or swelling.

I don't know what type of treatment you will need, but here are a few of the \"extra special\" things my team did for me... I never got poked with a needle without the area being totally numb first.  I would go in to the appointment about 30 minutes before I needed to have blood drawn of an IV placed.  They would look at my arm and find 2 or 3 places they might be going to use for the IV and they would put a numbing cream on those areas.  They always did at least 2 in case the first place didn't work they would have another one already numb.  The cream takes about 15 minutes to numb the skin, so after I waited they would give me a tiny shot of local anesthetic in the same area to numb me a bit deeper.  I never felt that little poke at all.  Then once I was totally numb they would start the IV or draw the blood....worked like a charm. I had to do chemo so that means LOTS of pokes.  Most people get an internal port placed on the chest, kind of by the collarbone.  If you get one of those, they can also use the numbing cream before inserting the needle through the skin into the port.  I chose instead to have an external Grochon catheter placed.  It was basically a little tiny tube that was inserted into my vein in my chest and left hanging out about 8 inches.  It had a little port on the end of it that the needles all went into for chemo and they could also draw my weekly blood tests from.  I didn't need any pokes for those.  It was kind of a pain in the neck to take care of because it always needed a sterile bandage over it. I also needed 2 weekly shots while on chemo.  Not everyone needs them, but I did.  My nurse gave them to me in the fat on my tummy.  At first she used the numbing cream before I got them, but over time I really got to where I didn't need it. Here is one little good thing about my cancer treatment...It totally cured me of my fear of needles!  By about 3 months into the whole process I could get blood drawn or get a shot with no fear whatsoever.  Having a real fear of needles is NOT a silly thing or something your medical team should take lightly.  It is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed by.  Everyone has things that scare them.  It is your doctors and nurses that need to find a way to help you through your fears until you can overcome them. Hang in there Big Hugs Deb C",

Since I have active cancer in my bone marrow, my doc doesn't want to use Procrit to boost my red blood cells, a decision I totally support.  The problem is that I am getting more and more anemic as treatment moves forward.  I am just barely above the threshold for getting my chemo tomorrow, but the doc assumes that by next week I will need a transfusion. I know the risks are small, but for some reason it is wigging me out!  I can't even determine why it has me scared, but I really don't want it.  I know I will feel better once my red cells are back up.  Right now I am lethargic and falling asleep at the drop of a hat....but I'm still spooked.

If you are not really interested in fishing the salmon run, i wouldn't come in July.  About the 10th of August things clear out and we go back to being a small town :) I love Alaska in the fall and winter.  If you wait until September we have usually had a good frost, so a lot of the bugs are dead.  There are also hunting opportunities in the area; everything from bear and moose to rabbits and spruce grouse.  Winter is spent skiing, both cross country and downhill, snowshoeing, winter festivals...lots of fun stuff. Look through those on-line guides and get an idea of what you would liek to do and see and that will give you a good idea of when to come. Deb C",

I have found that mornings are hard for me...I just can't seem to get going, so you may find that starting work a bit later in the day might help.

Our old camper was a 20 foot long 1971 aljo trailer.  It was a total wreck when we bought it 5 years ago.  My DH put in a whole new water system, got the furnace and stove running and I made all new cushions for the beds/couches. The layout had a couch that was in the back of the camper that pulled out into an almost double sized bed.  Above it there was a shelf that pulled out to a bed the same size.  It was perfect when the girls were little, but not now that they are bigger they really didn't fit in the bed anymore....SO We upgraded to a 24 foot trailer 1990 trailer that had a queen sized bed in a little bedroom and then a couch and a table that both make into a bed....room for everyone to sleep comfortably. We tent camped for years, so having a trailer seems like living large to us. We have several things that are necessary traditions when we go camping with the kids... We always have HoBo dinners.  You take a piece of tinfoil and put a big hamburger patty, a big handful of frozen hash brown potatoes and a couple of spoons of corn on it.  You top with a tablespoon or so of butter and some season salt, seal the whole thing up and cook over a fire.  If you have a grill on the fire, you can use that, or you can cook them on big rocks right at the edge of the fire. A few years ago we got some Pie Irons.  Basically they look like a iron sandwich maker on a stick.  You can make grilled cheese or hot sandwiches over the fire.  We discovered you can also make REALLY good hot pies.  You can either use sugar cookie dough, or the crescent roll dough you buy in a tube.  You fill each side of the iron with a thin layer of dough, then you put what ever you want in your pie....apple pie filling, fresh fruit and sugar, or our favorite: cherry pie filling, 2 squares of Hershey bar, and either a couple of little marshmallows or better yet a big dollop of Pillsbury already made cheesecake filling!  You close it up and cook it over low coals until the dough is cooked.  Turn it out on a plate and top with whipped cream or powdered sugar.  We have actually had people we don't know come over to our fire begging to know what smells SO good.  We always bring lots of ingredients so we can make lots and share Can you tell camping is all about the food?  LOL Actually, we usually either go somewhere we can hike in the mountains or go kayaking.  The girls like it when we go to a campground that has paved roads.  Then they bring their roller skis (cross country skis on wheels).  Deb C",

Quick recap : I was Dx with CSF mets about 6 weeks ago. I got double vision that got increasingly worse. After MANY tests and hospitalization we finally got the Dx of mets and started chemo into my CSF viaa spinal taps twice a week.  The vision slowly improved thought I picked up other side effects like nausea and palsey in my hands.  My \"bad\" cell count in my CSF went from 80 down to 5....good news.   The docs decided I needed a type of port placed in my brain, so last Friday I had an ommaya reservoir placed.  I was given conscious sedation and local anesthetic, which was weird.  Smelling and hearing the drill was kind of creepy. ANYWAY....I went into the operating room feeling pretty good.  I was only having a tiny bit of blurring to my vision, my nausea had been controlled with meds, even the hand shaking was better. hen I came out of the operating room I had the worst double vision yet, one of my pupils was a pin-prick and the other was huge and neither reacted to light,  both my eyes were kind of shaking in my head and would not look at what I wanted to focus on and I was puking again. 3 days in the hospital brought about 50% normalization on my pupils, but no real other changes in my vision.  I have gotten the puking back in control. SO, here I sit not being able to do any of the things I usually do to pass the time....can't read, can't crochet, can't really watch TV (I listen and then open one eye and peek at the picture for 20 seconds at a time), I can't read for more than 5 minutes at a time on the computer even when the view is set to the largest type size,  I don't dare use a knife or a hot burner.  I'm dropping everything I touch....I am SO frustrated!!!!  The tests show that there is a very small amount of cancer in my CSF>  all of the docs concur that there is a micomet or tiny amount of swelling around the C3 visual nerve that comes out of the brain.  They all feel that the vision will get better again because it did the first time. I hate that it is so hard to stay connected to all of you.  I had no idea just how much support I get here and how much I hate not knowing how you are all doing. I am just so sick of all of this!!!

My biggest problem with chemo so far has been low blood counts.  I have not wanted to use any of the blood boosting drugs because there is some evidence that when you have cancer in the marrow the procrit and neulasta might \"feed\" the cancer. My white counts are doing OK, they seem to bounce back enough each time for me to get my next chemo. My red cells on the other hand have not rebounded so well.  Twice I have gotten bad enough to need a transfusion.  Right now my H&H is about 25 and 8....really low, but not quite bad enough that my docs want to do another transfusion. I am really sick of the fast heart rate, low energy, & headaches that the anemia is causing. I am thinking of trying one or two shots of procrit....but I am scared.  Anyone out there on procrit with bone marrow mets?  Want to tell me your thoughts? Thanks Ladies....you guys ARE my experts!

I am doing OK on the combo.  I also had Taxol weekly on my first go-around with chemo 2 years ago.  That time I had done 6 DD A/C treatments first and had lots of side effects from the taxol.....nuropathy (sp?) in my hands and feet, nose bleeds, bone pain, mouth sores.....lots of problems.  This time around my worst side effect is the nose bleeds.  I still get some leg cramps and I feel tired on day 2 and 3 of each cycle, but a nap usually perks me up. The chemo is not a breeze, BUT so far it is doable and seems to be working: tumor markers are down and the vissible swelling in my lymph nodes is shrinking.  I get a CT scan in another month for more results. I'm sorry about the hair loss and having to be on IV drugs again.  Do yo have a port?  Mine sure makes things easier. Good luck and HUGS Deb C",

I got bone pain and lost finger and toe nails when I did the 12 week cycle of Taxol on my first time around with chemo 2 years ago.  This time I have some muscle cramping, but not much bone pain.  In fact, for the first time in months I'm not taking anything for pain right now.  My hair fell out pretty bad startying on week 3 of my treatments.  I cut it really short and last week finally shaved the last little bit off.  I was sick of finding hair in my food and drinks! I know how hard this is.  I still have bad days where I cry, or get really mad....but if it helps at all...this chemo looks like it is working for me.  All the visible swelling is gone in my lymph nides, the bone pain I have had for months is 95% gone.  The right side of my face was numb from the cheekbone down due to swelling in my nodes pinching a nerve and that has totally gone away.  My tumor markers are down too. I know chemo sucks, but give it a chance to work for you! Big hugs Deb C",
