I am in NOVA and seeing Dr. Kirsten Edmiston who is part of the INOVA Breast Care Center. I work in Healthcare and can tell you that seeing Dr. Edmiston was a no brainer. Honestly, I think I would see any of the docs in the practice because the entire group is amazing. The nurse navigator has held my hand every step of the way and they have really supported me. I've had many patients over the years see Dr. Edmiston and have nothing but good to say about her so when I first started down this path, I knew that's where I wanted to go. Good luck to you. While I'm still in the middle of recovery and have a long road to go, I feel so much better mentally now that the surgery is behind me. I hope you find the right fit doctor for you, it can make all the difference.",
