I stayed in the hospital overnight and was out the next morning.  I'm draining alot (over 100cc daily on the right side), so it'll probably be a while until they can come out.  Insicions look awesome and the surgeon 'spared' my tattoo!    I'm quite bruised and sore from the bruising, but as long as I stretch every now and then it seems alright.  Bonus, my back is not nearly as sore as it used to be.  That I noticed right away.  I'm already wearing a very loose mast. bra with foam padding and that seems alright.  So far it looks like I'm concave but the nurses have said all that will change as I heal.  I can't say I like the concave look, but hopefully it fills in better as the nurses said. I don't have the path. report yet, but will get that when I go in for my checkup.  ",

There was only the one tumor in my breast, which is why lumpectomy with auxillary disection was an option. My margins were clear also, it's the darn recurrance thing that ges to me.  I do not want to have to go through this again if at all possible.  Also, I wouldn't have chosen the lumpectomy if the MRI would have shown enlarged lymph nodes, which it didn't. I agree the real danger is METS, and for that chemo is in order.   Thanks for your suggestions of exercise for sleep and whatnot, but I am already back on my treadmill.  I was able to go for an hour yesterday and today, and have been doing approx 1/2 hour about 4 days prior.  I would consider walking outside, but, I live in Canada.   Anyone else out there have a mastectomy after lumpectomy?",

That is reassuring this is an option.  Not a decision I take lightly.   I have to wonder how recurrances are tracked exactly....is it tracked for 5 years?  Or would it be tracked for 3 years if a woman was in year 2 since the original diagnosis?    These are questions I'll have to write down and talk to my Onc once I meet him too.   What a crazy whirlwind....I don't even know what else to say....

Getting into see an Onc was an absolute nightmare.  I had to access our local and provincial health minister in order to get in.  The cancer clinic kept putting me off....long story short, my chemo of TCH started either 10 or 11 weeks after surgery (I can't recall exactly at this moment). In the meantime, I am ER+ at 100%, PR+ at 50%, and of course HER2+++.  Oh, and apparently I had DCIS also. Onc told me I am high risk.  No surprise.  Risk of recurrance in the affected breast is 25 - 33%.  That's pretty high.  The other breast is high risk for new or recurring cancer also.   I totally understand it is mets that I have to worry about...unfortunately.  But, the thing I can't get out of my mind is...there will be no screening after tx...a mammo once a year, that's it.  And if the cancer returns in the breast and isn't caught...then what?  Or if it is caught and has mutated further so that chemo/herceptin doesn't work...then what?  I can't do anything about mets other than exercize/diet, but this I can control.  I'd say a risk of 33% is pretty signifcant.  Wouldn't you? My Onc told me she could reduce my risk to 15%...that's 150% over a 10 year period. In light of this information - I've decided to have a BLM.  I don't want to deal with local recurrance if at all possible - heck - I don't want to deal with mets either but I don't control that. Cancer sucks, but, on the bright side, if I'm very lucky the chemo/herceptin will wipe it out.   You ladies are so supportive and a wealth of information - I am so thankful I found this site!!",

Thanks for any info you can share.  :)",

I had 2/12 nodes pos.  Am doing herceptin until March and am waiting, waiting, for a bmx.  So far everything has gone quite well, but have developed a throat/ear infection right after rads which I am on my 2nd round of antibiotics for.  They weren't going to do any additional scans for me either, but I asked for a baseline so they did a bone scan, and abd scan in addition to my chest xrays and mri. I don't post much, but read daily.  Have to say this thread is a very positve and informational experience!  ",
