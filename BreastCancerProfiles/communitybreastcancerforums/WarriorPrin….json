I'm hoping it comes back negative. The surgeon suspects stage II if we continue to see no lymph node involvement. Lymphatic and vascularity came back absent. If this IDC remains stage II and HER2- my prayers would be answered. I would only require lumpectomy with lymph node tests and radiation with pills.

I meet with the surgeon tomorrow. The results for the ER/PR/HER aren't back yet. I guess that will determine if I have to take chemotherapy. Any good news in this?

But now I'm thinking back to the last few trips to Atlanta when I was able to \" spend time\" with my dear bf and we used protection...but my extra comfort came in knowing that I was in chemo pause. But now I have all these other thoughts running through my head. I.e. 99% effectiveness of condoms...etc. I guess I say all that to say this: Have any of you gotten your periods back so soon and are my baby concerns legitimate or just my paranoia. I mean, I was there this time LAST week. I just want expecting to deal with periods/spotting for another few months. Wtf!?",

Figured I'd give you my story since we're all gonna be getting really cozy as we go thru chemo together.   Long story still kinda long: I'm 24, (turning 25 on 1/6), single, no children and am officially boobless. Before my diagnosis I was living in another city, found a job I loved after graduating college and stayed there for about a year. After a few run ins with a less than appreciative boss, I broke my lease/quit my job, and moved back home. Luckily, with the new health care policies, my mother was able to put me on her insurance immediately since I'm under 26. (Amen!) I noticed a small lump in my right breast and thought it fate that I had my yearly scheduled already within the next few weeks. Conclusion: Mammogram---> Ultrasound---> Needle Biopsy = Cancer.  So, here we are, two unsuccessful lumpectomies later and I am now recovering from a bilateral mastectomy w/ TE (12/7). Oh yeah, plus the Port which was THE MOST painful recovery ever. I went back to the surgeon and all but begged them to take it back out. (moment of weakness) I think if I had a clearer understanding of the placement I would've had more realistic expectations about the possible pain. Kudos to those of you who sailed through port placement.  Overall, me and my tiny rib cage are hanging in there with the expansion process, I'm only two fills in but the expander is only 250 cc b/c the PS said my rib cage was surprisingly small so he had to go w/ a smaller TE than planned.  I'm starting chemo 1/10 so although I will be celebrating the big 25 slightly smaller, ok I'm lying...very much smaller than before, my silver lining is that at least I will still have my hair. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about the chemo. I am not the type to sit home and I still have a pretty full social calendar ;)  I've read a few posters mention that you kinda get into a routine a few days in after your chemo rounds and can somewhat predict what days will be worse than others. Hopefully this is true b/c so far I have been able to take it all in stride and not let this rule my life. All I can recall as far as my chemo regimen (it's all a blur now) is that one combo will be once a week every other week for four rounds, and the next combo is once weekly for 12 wks. No radiation and then implant surgery after chemo.  Any words of advice is much appreciated. As soon as I can speak w/ my onco I'm going to find out (again, and write down this time) exactly which drugs I'll be receiving. Sorry I'm so vague...   :(",

As far as any damage done, there is no radiation involved w/ an MRI and if it was stopped quickly there would be no problem w/ your expanders. I won't scare you w/ the stories of what could have happened. My PS said he can usually feel the port but uses the magnet just to be sure. So if u did have any damage to the port it should be okay.  The tech should have asked u repeatedly about any metal/ foreign objects in your body prior to your scan. So I think a lot of people dropped the ball on this one. Why did your dr ask for it in the first place?",
