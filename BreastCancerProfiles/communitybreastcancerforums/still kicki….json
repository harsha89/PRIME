Yes, my doctor said that my breast cancer was caused from stress. I was in about the same boat you were in. Married 21 years to a real creep that did everything under the sun including I found out after my divorce from my daughter from a prior marriage that he fondled her when she was little. Had 5 kids I was trying to raise 2 from a previous marriage, trying to keep the family afloat and fed and him (a reformed alcoholic) reformed and keep the fighting down. The only difference between your husband and mine is mine got up one day and left. I didn't find out I had cancer til April of 08 and he left in Jan of 04 and the doc said when I was diagnosed that by the size of the one in my breast and the fact that it had spread that I had had it for about 4-5 yrs. Amazing huh? I don't have any kind of cancer in my family either. So, to answer your question, according to my onchologist and she seems to know what she's doing ....yes it comes from stress.",

      "Content": "Jul 13, 2010 08:44AM - edited Jul 13, 2010 08:44AM by still-kickin I read your post this morning, and I noticed that you said you joke about the cancer, well I do too. It gets to the point after awhile this stuff is here to stay so we might as well make the best of it. My doc says thats probably why I have made as much improvment as I have. I know when I started gaining weight from the steroids, I got to where I joked about it cause I just got tired of complaining about it. Before I was diagnosed I had fought to lose weight and finally lost 79 lbs 2 years before I was diagnosed. Then turned around with my steroid friends and gained 50 of it back. Wierd cos I wasn't really eating while on Chemo. Well, I told her (the doc) that I was going to lose weight she went bolistic on me. She said No your not fat you have just blosomed\" I said \"Blosomed nothing I went into full bloom!\" But, yes I agree with you, joking is the best medicine. Good luck.",

Just a bunch of HEALTHY women. And God will make it happen. I believe that. I know we have never met and don't know what each other looks like except for our photos. But, believe it or not this is the closest I have felt to people in a long long time. My friends have all congratulated me, but in their eyes you can see the thoughts of \"I wonder how long\" I personally don't care how long I am not going to worry about that because right now I am healthy happy and proud and when and  if it ever comes back...well I will cross that bridge when I come to it and I know that I have friends inside this screen who will be there for me. I love you all you ARE my friends. Everyone (not just us) needs to remember Every Day is a blessing and every Year a miracle. Thanks again",

My appointment is tomorrow. Well, about 3 o'clock today the phone rang, I looked at the caller ID expecting it to be one of the kids. When I saw \"Dr. Toma's Office\" on the phone I froze. All the thoughts that run thru my mind....I started not to answer it. I decided even though I was at home alone I would face up and take it like a big girl so I answered it. It was Vicky Dr. T's nurse, she said Paula, we received the results of your PET scan and I figured  you shouldn't wait til tomorrow.....It shows NO PRESENT EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY\"  You know that is as hard to comprehend as when they told me It was cancer. So, for now I can relax, go to my herceptin treatments and be normal until or if that day comes when it decides to act up again. I just wanted to share my good news with everyone. Thanks for all the support and prayers, I haven't been on here long but, I will continue to be here. Even tho I have not met any of you in person, you all are the closest friends I have had in a long long time. Remember anythings possible to get thru even cancer all you need is God, a good doc and great friends. Don't forget I will always be here for you all too. Thanks again, Paula",
