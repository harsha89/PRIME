She has an awesome team being assembled including the oncologist from her first bout. Surgery will be happening in the coming weeks after some more testing. I don't think it's Stage 0 like it was her first time around, but I could be wrong and I'm hopeful they caught it early. Lord knows she gets checked frequently enough. In the meantime we're just trying to keep things as normal as possible and I'm doing everything in my power to stay the hell away from doctor google.",

She recently had an MRI which came back normal (except for the initial little growth) and she just had some genetic testing done which also came back normal. Her surgery is booked for a couple weeks from now, so I'm just praying that we get good news Re: the lymph nodes. So far her doctors are talking about radiation treatment but I know that's premature.",

She's the type who can't not work and is always putting others before herself, so she's understandably annoyed that she has to go through this again. I know there's little I can do except wait and hope for the best, but in the meantime I'll be reading plenty of books and trying to bring some normalcy to her schedule. Icietla, thank you as well! That's very informative. Her last bout happened so long ago that she didn't remember whether they looked at her lymph nodes, so it bothered her a bit. She meets with her surgeon within the next couple days so she'll have a better idea what her treatment plan will be soon. I'm trying not to pepper her with questions and I do believe he mentioned favoring radiation, but I know nothing is ironclad this early in the game. They initially discovered this growth a couple months ago. It was such a tiny blip on their radar that they had her come back last week for some more tests, which brings us to today. Unfortunately I don't have access to the pathology report but will have more info within the week. Thank you again!",
