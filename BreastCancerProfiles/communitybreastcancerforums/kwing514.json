My sister was diagnosed with breast CA at age 46, 10 years later 2012, mother was also diagnosed with breast CA, shockingly a week later another sister was diagnosed with uterine CA. Now on 9-11-13 I was diagnosed with breast CA. Genetic testing was a must in this case. All 3 sisters tested Negative for BRCA1 & BRCA2.  Throughout my journey I keep saying, \"There has to be a genetic cause.\"",

I found the last week of treatments to be the worst as far as zapping my energy, so you may take advantage of those people, who in the beginning offered their help. This is when I needed it the most, but of course due to the timing everyone was busy with the Holidays. So I had to manage it alone. I also had very little redness until the last week with the final 2 days bringing on irritation as well. I am now coming up on 2 weeks since treatments ended and I have to say this has been the toughest part since first Dx, both physically and psychologically. I have been drained from the uncomfortable nature of the irritation/itching and the redness has spread and gotten deeper red to the whole breast area and in the armpits the skin has peeled to rawness, due to the rubbing of the skin. Unless I am able to prop my arm up and out to the side it's going to rub.....Do you know how many times your arm rubs against your body??? constantly...I have also had pain/tenderness in the area of the nipple with every little touch and breeze. At this point that has lessened a bit, so thankfully that points to healing. I use the pure Aloe gel and Aquaphor constantly, as advised by the professionals. The Rad Onc staff says this is expected and as long as the area is not oooozing, time will heal. I just NEVER thought it would be this bad for this long. I get chill bumps every time I look at it. As for the psychological aspect, since I got through Dx, biospy, genetic testing, surgery,  and most of Rads with very little problems, I had it in my mind I would be OK as soon as treatments were finished, and could get on with my life. So when I started having these problems I was very disappointed. Thanks for listening. I just wanted to let others know there may be more healing time if your body reacts the way mine did to the treatments. I wish I had known so that I would be prepared for a longer recovery time. ",
