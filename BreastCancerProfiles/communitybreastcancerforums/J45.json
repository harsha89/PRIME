The mass is about 7mm, which I thought meant small, but once they said the armpit glands were swollen, I lost all hope of it being small and contained inside just the breast :( I am so afraid to leave my child motherless - it's all I can think about.

I realize it's ridiculous that I haven't even been diagnosed yet, and I'm this scared, but this armpit node thing has made me feel so hopeless. I can't imagine why else I'd have the swollen nodes otherwise. I can now easily find/feel the swollen, sore lymph nodes in my armpit. I have been trying to reassure myself that people survive this, even when it's spread to the lymph nodes . . . but it seems like everybody you hear about, celebrities, friends, etc. always say, \"they caught mine early - before it spread to my lymph nodes\". That feels so discouraging. I am such a baby.",

I'm so glad to know that - it's such an easy thing to try and figure out all we can online only to end up more upset than ever. I will be praying for an excellent test result for you. Our minds are just a terrible enemy sometimes when we have to wait. I was amazed the other day when I mentioned my anxiety about the test results to the radiologist - she misunderstood and thought I was terrified of the upcoming biopsy itself. I had to tell her that the actual procedure didn't frighten me - just fearing what she'd find. It was odd - as though she didn't already know that. You would think she would be accustomed to the dread people have awaiting results.",

My husband's 1st wife died of breast cancer about 19 years ago. I must remember that she had the lump for a long time before they truly tested and determined it was cancer . . . and then it was very large and had spread . . . So many advancements have taken place since then - My prayer is that God would not make him go through this again with another wife.  I got some Xanax from my doc, but strangely it only seems to make me a bit drowsy - doesn't seem to help the anxiety. Perhaps I have such strong anxiety that no pill can beat it lol! I can't put into words how amazing it is to have you gals on here . . . it's like you are the only ones who get the real panic, terror, sadness. . . and it's like you are all old friends I've known forever. My fat kitty has climbed up into my face now - she thinks biting me on the nose is therapeutic for some reason.",

I had a dream that my husband, son and I were traveling through a large theme park - I believe the park was representative of our journey through life in general - anyway they went ahead of me through a glass door which locked behind them - I couldn't get the door open and was knocking, but they didn't see me and went on their way, leaving me behind. I think it was like an analogy to how these battles are ours alone to fight even though others are there with us. I have to remember I am not alone. Everyone on here is fighting alongside each other :) When I come on here, I don't feel so alone anymore.",
