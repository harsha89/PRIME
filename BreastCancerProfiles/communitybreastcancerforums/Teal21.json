    "Content": "Teal21 wrote: Hello all!  I had a core needle biopsy about three weeks ago (results came back benign ) and today I finally removed my waterproof bandage. The doctor instructed me to wait until today since she also removed most of the mass during the biopsy. It was a larger surgery. She used skin glue and steri strips to close the incision, however when I removed everything (which was a bit painful) I saw that my tiny incision was not fully closed. There was no bleeding or discharge it was fully dry, I want to say, but there is still an indentation in my skin. It seems as if the two sides of the skin have not met and fully closed.  I'm very concerned. Is this normal? Will my incision fully close eventually? Should I keep it covered longer? I will call my doctor tomorrow but I wanted to get your input as well.   Hope you guys have some advice! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
