During the treatment i felt everything the nurse said i would. When i got in the car straight afterwards to come home i felt drunk. For about 3 hrs i felt drunk, and just as happy by the way lol. Then i started feeling sick, bad, headache, tired, indigestion, etc. This all lasted for 8 days. When my nurse called she said that i must be very sensitive to the chemo drugs, just wish i was that sensitive to a glass of wine, when i was allowed it lol. My 2nd treatment is in 6 days, so dont know if its a trait with me or just the 1st one. I was also told that my hair would fall out after the 2nd to 3rd treatment. Well it started fallin out 14 days after the 1st, so i shaved the rest off, n am lovin the new look lol. Think we are all different, n may cope n feel things in our own lil way, but it is interestin to read about others n there reactions, considerin mine are supposed to be rare! ((((HUGS by the pigeon post))))",

Found about 2 days later i bunged up with no effect from natural remedies, had to get from g.p, some awful wall paper paste that made me the other way to flush me out, but quite frankly was just relieved to be flushed out lol. 1st trip to the hops today, with my new hair do or lack thereof, went well, and i find myself enjoyin my new look. just looked and the E&C is...epirubin and cyclophosphamide, yes steroids too, if your referin to the anti sickness pills, cant remember what the hospital gave me but they didnt work, had a second lot didnt work, now have prochlorperazine maleate buccal, will let you know 2nd time round if they work!

      "Content": "whitty04 wrote: I started chemo 10 days ago, E&C.  I have done so much research these last couple of days, its left me confused as to whether ive made the right decission.  I first read 'The Cancer Report' from 'youtube'. Informing of how & where cancer started, to how & where chemo started. Also many different forms of treatment & cures. Ive also read about Dr Bryznski, & hemp oil. The problem i have is that having chemo is reportedly, in this read, increasing your chances by 35% + of suffering secondry cancers such as lung, liver, soft tissue, bone, cerfix, kidney, etc., eye problems, kidney/ liver problems. Is this not a trade off? Ive been told that after my surgery, which was successful, i DO NOT have cancer, but need chemo to prevent it growing back. Then radiation on the breast to be sure, then pills to stop it feeding off my hormones. If i dont have cancer, surely to have chemo and put my body under extreme toxic poison is just asking for further cancer trouble down the line. Like wise with radiation, as we all know these drugs are Bio chems, and extremley poisonous and dangerous.  It seems crazy to put myself at such risk, and has left me wondering if it is all worth it.  I felt very ill after my 1st chemo sesh, it lasted a week and now i feel fine, with the help with yet more drugs(medications). My weight has piled on which in its self is upsetting me imensely, All for what, my nurse tells me, in the hope that we can prevent the cancer coming back, but at the risk of giving me one of many other cancers in the future. I think i too understand why a cure will never become available, (its all in the cancer report mentioned above) so having read all this information, feel now ' Have i made the right decission?', Any of your thoughts on this, and if you manage to read the report mentioned above your thoughts on that too would be of great help to me.

      "Content": "whitty04 wrote: Heyup all, Had my 2nd session of E&C chemo 10 days ago. My meds were changed to Emend, to be taken just before chemo, then 3 days after, this stopped the vomittin but still felt sick. Indigestion under control  with lansoprazole. Felt fine until 5 days later, constipation so takin movicol, nausea so takin buccal (not workin tho), ulcerated tongue usin mouth wash, bad sore throat, and a dizzy drunk feelin, tired limbs, metal taste, broken sleep, weight gain. Im unable to drive due to the drunk feelin n dizziness, cant sometimes walk as its like im actually drunk n sway all over the place. My vision went physodelic too. Im havin the meds manually injected into my hand, before my 3rd session i will have a hicks line in my neck, as it really hurt and have been told the pain will get worse without this line, now my hand and arm are quite sore too. This has really scared me this time round. Didnt expect all this to happen, n what i did expect to suffer from i thought would happen in the 1st few days like the 1st session i had.  I couldnt shake it off, or even just plod on through it all, and resorted to goin to bed so i didnt do myself any more injury by fallin with the dizziness etc. My husband and daughter stepped up to the mark with the younger children.  Im so scared. Firstly, that all this happened, so severly. And secondly, really scared to go through it all again, ive got 4 more treatments to do. Ive lost all my hair, which has gone so well with me and the children, we actually like it, and i love not havin to faff in the mornins with it. I just didnt want to be so poorly, and end up in bed. I feel very spaced out, and disconnected from the world, get worn out at walkin up the stairs, not so good. Im hopin this wont get any worse with more treatments. In fact im prayin it wont. The docs have said im very sensitive to the chemo drugs, does anyone else feel so bad? From someone lookin forward to feelin ok x  Dx 3/22/2011, IDC, 3cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 0/4 nodes, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
