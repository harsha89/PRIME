I am looking for a good on-line community where I can learn more about coping with stage iv BC from those with the same diagnosis. I read about poet Anya Silver and how involved in on-line communities she was, and how she was able to forge some valuable relationships online, but I simply don't know how to find them. MBC is a lonely place! I welcome suggestions on where we can better connect. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

I was dx at 44 with stage 1, and told I had a 6 percent chance of recurrence --and dontcha know it happened anyway in July 2017. I have been stage iv since, with liver mets. On Taxol, herceptin, perjeta and every scan shows real improvement. I am gunning for NED! I need hope that I may get there and stay there. You were so kind to post on your anniversary. Thank you. I will read and reread and reread your post! The rest of you inspire me as well. So many wonderful people living full lives despite the challenges. xox ",
