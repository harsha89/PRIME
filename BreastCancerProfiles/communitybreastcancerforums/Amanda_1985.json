    "Content": "Amanda_1985 wrote: Hi all, I am looking for a breast surgeon to help me remove a particular area in one of my breast that has been diagnosed with atypical intraductal hyperplasia (or atypia). I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and my OBGYN has suggested me that I should go and see Dr. Archana Ganaraj, Dr. Mary Brian, and Dr. Roshni Rao for more information. Has anyone in Texas ever been to one of these breast surgeons? I am currently researching their history and have found good information, but very little reviews from the patients themselves. I'd like to ask for y'alls opinions & experience to help assist me with my decision. Thanks and Happy Mother's Day! Best Regards, Amanda Log in to post a reply",
