I'm 55 (56 this month!),my husband works out of country and we're pretty much home bodies. Have a few relatives around but not close to any as we did not grow up together so no one to really chat with about this. I noticed a while back that my armpit was swollen. Didn't think much of it at the time; thought maybe I lifted something too heavy and strained my arm... no pain. It's been a month or more ago and honestly I don't know if it ever went down. Didn't hurt, so I didn't bother with it. Been fighting fluid behind the ear drum for a couple of months and after no avail, went to the doctor to see if wax was balled up or what is going on. At the same time, I asked if that issue could be causing the swelling under my arm. Doc felt and had a huge look of concern on her face. She knows that my grandmother, mother, 2 uncles, and 1 aunt all have had cancer (lung, colon, skin... and I myself had cervical cancer 30+ years ago). I have never been one to go to the doctor. One of those folk who say \"if I'm not down right sick in bed, I'm doing fine\". I had breast implants 13 years ago and have only had one mammogram since then. Waiting for a disaster I guess. So.. here I go. I have my appointment for a mammogram and ultrasound this afternoon.... Calm on the outside... a worried mess inside. Thanks for 'listening'... God Bless. Log in to post a reply",

Since the order for the mammogram and ultrasound were \"diagnostic\", I was told immediately afterwards that \"everything looks good, nothing to worry about\". Yet I'm still worried! I will request a copy of the results and tests to keep on hand. I guess I just continue the antibiotics. Once those are gone perhaps the swelling will be also. If not; testing will continue as I've found swollen lymph nodes in my groin now. Thank you ladies for your kind words. God bless.",
