Before my operation I was a Fitness instructor for Prime Movers teaching Seniors from 50 to 97. Have you ever had time to put on your favorite music and just relax and move to it? I had neck pain day and night for nearly 5 years till I learned some simple and fun exercises. So sorry to hear about your pain. I need to get better pain management for my sensitive areas at the moment. XOX ðŸ˜‹",

Can anyone suggest effective pain management that relaxed them enough to do the daily exercises effectively? 2 500mg of panadol and 2 nurofen 200mg are NOT killing the pain and pulling in my left arm from the elbow upwards!! There is also stinging from the armpit and nipple that was relocated! My left shoulder blade small muscles have become very week in just 17 days! Can't bring my arm up to the side at shoulder height!! Thank you.",
