I am having a lumpectomy on Thursday, and then will shortly have to decide. I had a mastectomy the first time, mostly to avoid the decision, but I am built so that I lost most of my lymph nodes to the mastectomy. Would like to have one \"good\" side. I keep going back to the fact that radiation causes cancer. How is the radiation therapy different from other types of radiation, the ones that cause cancer? I have had more than my share of radiation exposure, actually worked at a nuclear weapons plant for a year that has a class action award for former employees that have been diagnosed with cancer. I am five days short in qualifying for the award. I blame my first crazy tumor on wearing my iPhone on my purse strap, the new one I blame on many hours with my iPad on my lap with wifi on. There are other factors of course, but my gut feeling is very strong about this. So I am between, hell no, not more radiation! And the recurrence numbers I know will be quoted.",

I've got a big mess under my arm, inflamed scar tissue has formed a ditch, and there's sort of a tire of swelling between that and my underarm. Was told to go to Lymphedema PT, so had my first appointment this morning. She noticed some infection in the bad area, so back to the doctor, where I picked up a copy of my pathology report. The report says 0/16 nodes were tested. So I asked the CNP about it. Something about when the doctor went for the clear margins, he took the breast tissue over to the side, where there was a lot of yellow fat. I am 5'4\" and weigh 160 pounds, so there was a little fat, but not that unusual. And the nodes were blue from the injections. My tumor was not to the side, it was 2.5 cm at the 10 o'clock position just above my nipple. So now I am clearly at risk for lymphadema. How does this happen? And how did the surgeon not realize he removed an extra 14 nodes? I mean if he realized it, wouldn't he have told me about it? I guess not, because when I saw him for a followup he had gotten the report back and still didn't mention it. I just cried all the way home.

I'm supposed to go for a fitting tomorrow to get a compression sleeve and glove for traveling, and see if there is anything that can help the swelling on my trunk in my armpit. Interesting copay yesterday. Because the PT office was considered part of the hospital, I had to make a \"hospital outpatient facility\" copay of $75. And I'm supposed to go back once a week! If it were a clinic, my copay would be in the $25-$35 range. Now I've got to find another PT facility with a lymphedema specialist. My insurance is BCBS Federal.

It says that the nodes were in the anxillary tail, and that most were bisected, some were trisected. Does that sound like the fat pad? He also told me that I was still Stage II, and that seemed to be good news. The report does not look that good. My Nottingham stage is a 7-8, with a Mitotic count of 3. Guess I will be hearing more about that from my Onco too, appointment next week. After figuring that out, I'm not so focused on my missing nodes right now. ",

I will be 59 next week, it seems many of you are much younger. Because I have a history of chemical allergies and a recent diagnosis of Sjogrens, I will not have Rads and probably not chemo. I am worried about the general anesthesia, so aiming to have only one surgery. My Onco is supportive of this.

When my surgeon stopped by to \"sign\" me, my husband and I were laughing about something. Can't remember what, but the surgeons' expression was sort of like \"you don't see THAT everyday\". Right, I remember nothing after being wheeled into the surgery room and shifting to the operating bed. Out like a light. Here's a sentinel node shot story, which is the thing I was probably most worried about. It's the first thing they did. On the phone, the pre-op nurse told me it didn't hurt. The nurse that morning admitted that it could hurt a bit. In fact, she said the doctor doesn't talk much because one woman actually made him cry. Apparently, he told a woman that it wouldn't hurt, and she screamed at him. Something along the lines of \"let's stick some needles in your boob and see how you like it!\"  Actually, with the numbing spray, there was barely a sting with the shots. I made sure to tell him it wasn't bad. ",

I agree, your immune system is compromised and it's easier to catch other stuff.  Speaking of which, I'm feeling like my surgeon lied to me. Before surgery, we talked about nodes and he told me he would take 2, and if they were clear that was it. AFTER surgery, he told my husband that he took 2 and they were clear. A week later at my checkup he'd gottent he path report and he said nodes are clear, you're still stage 2, go to PT, I'll see you in 3-4 months.  Picked up a copy of my path report yesterday and he took 16 nodes. No wonder my armpit is such a mess. I have a wound between two swollen masses that isn't healing well. When the PT had me do some stretches it started weeping, so now I'm on antibiotics. That probably wasn't the worst news on the report though. Don't know what it all means yet, but my Nottingham score (SBR) is a 7-8/9. Will find out more next week, but right now my mood is very down.

Made it to Walmart yesterday. Found a big cotton camp shirt for $7, a soft hoodie with inside pockets for $7, and a soft front close bra for about $8. Score! If anyone is interested, they carry Arm & Hammer baking soda natural deoderant for $2. Most \"natural\" deoderants are a lot more expensive. ",
