Sonia - I understand a lot of what you are saying about the weird feelings.  I feel like I go between feeling disconnected from other people who haven't been through what I've been through to feeling like so many things are so trivial.  Getting upset about work just seems so insignificant to me and I would previously have described myself as a workaholic.  I guess this is what they describe as the new normal. Kim - thank you for starting this group.  I found myself coming to this group way more frequently than any of the others I joined.  I think I am going to follow your lead and pop over to the hormonal therapy list and start a sept tamox start if theree isn't one already.  If I could feel like I brought together half as many people as this group did I'd consider it a success!",

Brenda - I've started doing yoga and I have to admit I have really found it helps me.  I used to be of the mindset that if I wasn't burning calories or sweating it was a waste of my time but I have to say the calm I get lingers way past the class when it is over.  I didn't think I'd be able to shut down my brain to disconnect but I've really started to get into the whole zen mindset.  I only go once a week so the progress has been slow but little by little I am improving.  If you don't want to spend any cash but give it a try you can download yoga podcasts for free on iTunes.

I was prepared for that outcome but I really wish I had been able to have a lumpectomy for a number of reasons.  The reconstruction process with radiation can be tough.  Many PS's won't do a flap procedure if they know you are going to have rads because it is so hard on the skin.  My surgery was in May and I am finally having my exchange surgery on Tuesday (to swap the TE for a permanent implant). I wore a prosthesis from May until October until my skin recovered enough to get fills.  My MX breast is still smaller than my other one and my PS thinks I'll still need a lat flap down the road to achieve symmetry.  That totals 3 trips to the OR plus one more outpatient \"procedure\" for nipple reconstruction.  Again. . .if a MX is what will help you feel at ease, you should do what is right for you. . .just a few tidbits of my experiences.  Hope you are hanging in there. ",

If you can't tell, I am kind of in an angry phase.  Maybe angry, maybe frustrated.  I am hoping a few days away will be a good outlet for my anger.  I am also completely frustrated because I've managed to gain 10 lbs since September.  I can take ownership for some less than ideal holiday eating but this is ridiculous!

If he added the lat flat, I'd likely still need a small implant.  It would just give my breast a more teardrop shape (rather than the totally round hamburger bun look I have now).  The iron bra feeling I have is from the implant being placed underneath my pec muscle (which is what they do in reconstruction).  Switching to a samller implant and doing the lat flap would ideally give me some relief from the iron bra while also giving my some skin to recon the nipple.  I am about 80% sure I wont do it.  I said I didn't want to start over and my PS said it was more like an add on.  He told me reconstruction iwth TE frequently requires revisisions but that seems like so much work to me.  The procedure I've been reading the most about is \"Brava\".  There are several doctors who do fat grafting to smooth out imperfections in an implant recon or fill in divets in a large lumpectomy.  However, there is a surgeon in Miami who is reconstructing entire breasts with your own fat.  It is relatively new but the research I've been doing is promising.  Many women can go without implants or at least size down to a smaller one.  I have been posting on a few other threads and on fatgraftpatients.com to get informated.  My hopes are high!  Whew. . .mind dump.  Sorry for that, I've been consumed with google searches about fat grafting for the last few days!",

I also had chemo before surgery.  My BS explained it to me like this. . .your pathology report kind of has an \"asterisk\" by it since you had chemo first.  You don't know exactly how large the tumor was or whether or not lymph nodes were involved before the chemo did its job.  I've read from other posters that they had a sential node biopsy before surgery in order to be staged accurately.  My oncologist and BS were comfortable that the treatment approach wouldn't necessarily be that different whether or not the node was involved.  Every doctor is a little different, but I am guessing that is what they mean when describing the pathology reports.",

I also flew in a surgical camisole with a foob and had no trouble.  Makes you wonder if these things even work to hear how different our experiences are!",

I know a lot of people don't get a determination on chemo until they get their oncotype score.  I did chemo first but for many people the oncotype score can predict how likely they are to benefit from chemotherapy as well as how likely they are to experience a recurrance. I have also encountered a lot of people who had a mastectomy and didn't \"need\" radiaiton.  My rad onc left it up to me.  He said that although there isn't a ton of information about whether or not women who have a mastectomy \"should\" have radiation, research shows that they can decrease the chances of a recurrance by adding it. I hope this helps!  You may meet with the rad onc and find out you don't need rads at all.  I will say that although it wasn't fun going there every day, I got through it with minor discomfort. Good luck with your decision.",
