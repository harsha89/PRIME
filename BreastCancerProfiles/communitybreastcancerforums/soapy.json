Gone through a month of tests, old history of mytrial valve prolapse...no symptoms...cardiologist that did workup for my oncologist found Aortic Stenosis with 60% blockage. If he wouldn't have told me, I wouldn't have known! Again, no symptons. Have been put on anastrozole as of 10/3/12. It has shrunk tumor and I go for another PET scan in Jan. before I see oncologist. Since I am not yet on chemo. the cancer center that my oncologist works with has not contacted me after the initial orientation. I feel I am not important to them any longer, and I resent this...I need support too!! When I mention this to the nurses or other staff, I get no answers. I have so many questions, and sometimes I don't think of them until after I see the md. Like when I found out no chemo...I was in shock for some days wondering how long I had. I hope I can get some info and support here.",
