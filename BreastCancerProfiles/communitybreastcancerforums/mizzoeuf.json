Had double lumpectomy, no node involvement, clear margins and was given all the hope in the world! I had 4 rounds of taxol and 33 rads and my oncologist cheerfully told me that I was completely cured.    About a month ago I started feeling a pain in my rib so last week went for a bone scan (my oncologist basically was just humouring me because I was so worried...!) and it showed that I have spine mets. I am now receiving 10 emergency rounds of radiation to my L7 which has showed multiple lesions. I, like you, am devastated. I feel like my life has literally been pulled out from underneath me in the space of a week. I am numb. I am so shocked that this has happened to me or to anyone at this age. I am so angry that the very best I can hope for is a life of 'stable disease'.  I wish I could hug you too. I want to say how brave you are because we are brave, although I don't feel it quite now. I want to focus on all the wonderful stories that I have read in this forum. I really think that there is a lot of light out there for us, it is just hard to focus on it and believe it. I am thinking of you and sending all the positive energy I can your way.   Like many have said, you sound like a beautiful person. I wish you all the very very best and please know how much finding this thread has meant to me. I have felt so alone the last week and although I hate that there is something else feeling like I do, it has helped me.  If you would like to chat privately I would really like that. Much love and hugs xx Mizzoeuf ",

      "Content": "mizzoeuf wrote: Hi all, I was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in April 2010 and my oncologist told me I would make a full recovery. I have no family history etc etc. In March 2011 after bone scan that I requested they discovered I had mets in my spine and my sternum. I had radiation to my spine and it cleared that area. A scan in July showed no new areas of growth and healthy bone growth in my spine. I am so devastated. I cannot come to terms with this. I have all the classic symptoms of grief and the most worrying is denial. One part of me knows that this will never go away and I should be glad for each day that I wake up and can get out of bed but another part of me keeps thinking that I will still beat this. I don't know what to do. I have monthly fusions of Zometa and my onc says my tumour markers are going down each month. I have a scan coming up on 14th of November and I am terrified. I just want some hope or some advice from other bone mets battlers :-) Love, Mizz  Dx 3/23/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 0/4 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Nov 3, 2011 06:59PM - edited Nov 3, 2011 07:00PM by mizzoeuf Thank you all so very much for responding to me. This forum is the most amazing place. I feel so much better after reading your posts. I think I have found my inspiration :-) My plan currently is daily Femara (changed from Tamoxifen when my mets were found), monthly infusion of Zometa, three monthly Zoladex. I am not taking any other kind of aromatase inhibitors. I am in Ireland so the treatments may vary - another reason I wanted to come here to see if I could pick up any tips! In a lot of ways I am mourning my fertility more so at the moment I think. I have always wanted a baby. Menopausal symptoms suck but really they are not too bad.... A couple of hot flushes everyday and a pot belly that was never there before! I still work full time - that keeps me sane (never thought I would hear myself say that!) LOL!  I am starting to experience some joint pain and a lot of general stiffness so I hope I can keep the Zometa going for as long as possible. There is a lady at my clinic who has been doing the Zometa for 7 years with no progression so I am aiming for at least that! My onc has not considered chemo as yet. I think he is keeping the big guns up his sleeve. I am kinda relieved about that as I am just a year out of my last chemo and my eyelashes are still falling out in cycles!! I have a cute little crop of hair now so I'll be thankful for that. Big big hugs to you all. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I feel immensely cheered up xxx If anyone has any good tips on complementary medicines e.g. oil supplements for keeping bones healthy....? ",
