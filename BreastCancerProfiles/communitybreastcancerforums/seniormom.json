I felt like I had just been given a death sentence.  I cried and was terrible sad like I my days were over. For a couple of weeks I could not speak about it without crying. Many appointments later, not to mention lots of prayers. I told all my friends and anyone that asked. The more people knew, the more prayers I would receive. By the time the surgery for lumpectomy and lymph node biopsy on Aug. 1st, I had relaxed somewhat.  The cancer had spread to the lymph node, on Sept. 10th has axillary dissection, another cancerous node.  A total of 19 nodes, 2 were cancerous.  I keep very positive that all will be fine, and leave myself in God's hands.  I have just started on Letrozole (Femara) by late next week radiation. My oncologist did not recommend chemo, I took her recommendation.  My axillary dissection is still sore after 6 weeks, but getting better every day. I had a drain for almost 3 weeks. No more tears, if it comes back I will deal with it and I don't worry too much anymore, although it's always in the back of my mind. At some point you will probably feel the same way after the initial shock goes away.    I have read everything I can on this cancer, the more informed you are the less frightening it becomes. You will beat it just keep positive.       ((Hugs and prayers))",
