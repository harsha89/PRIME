My daughters teacher had BC last year and she sent a note home to the parents letting us know so that we could discuss it with the kids. We talked to my daughter about it and explained what it meant. The teacher returned to school in September and looks fabulous! When, I explained to my daughter about my BC, I told her that I have the same thing mrs. d had and now she is back to school and doing well and I will be too. I just have to get treatment first and the treatment can make me sick while I'm going through it. We are really open about it. You have to know your child. I know mine is very perceptive and if I was sick all the time and I didn't prepare her, she would be scared.  My husband is supportive for the most part, but then he says something stupid and I get pissed. Today I did a little PSA on facebook. Nothing maudlin, just a hey if I can get it, you can too so check your breasts and get your mammos. Well, he texted me that he was hearing thru the grapevine about my fb post and he thought we weren't living this thru social networking. Made me feel stupid for posting. I felt like I did a public service. I know many young women just like me who have the potential to get cancer just like me and who thought they were safe just like I did. Times like this, I wish I was single. Lol Oh and three of my friends scheduled mammograms today!",

I'm a nurse so I'm really very open about medical issues in general. Iam very forthright. I look very very healthy. I imagine when I go back to work( I've been out since my lumpectomy)  I will be bald. Because I am an open book, I don't think anyone will be too surprised and really? Too bad if they are. I am concerned about my 8 year old daughter. We talked about my hair loss and she really really wants me to wear a wig. I totally understand and respect her feelings and I promised her that I will always wear a wig when her friends are around or we are out together. I never want her to feel bad about how I look or feel bad about herself because of how I look or feel bad about feeling embarrassed about my bald head. To avoid all those issues, I'm just going to get a wig ASAP. Lol I imagine that as she gets used to it, she will adjust and it maybe won't be such a big deal to her, but if it is,  that's ok too. Someone on these discussion boards talks about her new \"normal\" after her diagnosis. Its a perfect way to describe this journey.  I'm interested in seeing what my new normal is. ",

I'm not sure if its because I was so wound up about having the treatment that I just exhausted myself or if its  related to the chemo.  So far, and it's only been three hours lol, I just have a little bit of a aching in my shoulders and tiredness. No nausea. I was given decadron, emend and aloxi prior to the a/c. The nurse said the emend and aloxi are long acting (like 48-72 hours long)  She said I may feel nauseous on Sunday. I am  going to plan not to be nauseous. Lol.  A couple of the ladies at chemo are raving about hemp oil for disease modification. I'm too tired to investigate. Have any of you  heard Of this?  I'm a science girl. I respect it, appreciate it, and am grateful for it, but as an adjuvant therapy, if it works, great. I will ask the doctor at  my next visit next week.  Hope everyone has a good evening. .Im going to  catch up on everyone's post and then take a nap. Or vice versa :)",

It's sad that our lives have been hijacked by cancer. My fear of the tx was so much bigger than the tx itself. The fear of the unknown was so horrible. But it wasn't bad, at all. Other than the lady next to me who talked my ear off for three hours, it wasn't bad. Actually listening to her talk wasn't that bad either. Obviously she needed to talk to someone and in retrospect, I guess I'm glad I could help. My mo Prescribed Ativan before chemo. I took a 0.5  mg and that did take the edge off.  We will get through this. This is the work we have to do to get better. It sucks definitely, but I thank God everyday that there are treatments that can help us. It's pointless to tell you not to worry, because you will worry anyway. Take heart though, you WILL get through this. ",

I am NOT a cancer girl, in my head anyway.   I'm concerned about getting a decent wig and hat. I have no idea how to tie a scarf on my head and actually i dont want to look like a grandma. Has anyone bought a wig yet? Any tips? One thing that really pisses me off is I finally found the hairdo for me, last week, and now it's gonna fall out. WTH!   I want to work throughout this process if at all possible. I am much better when I'm out of the house and productive.
