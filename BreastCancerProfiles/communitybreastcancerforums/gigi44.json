I have an hour or two and then I get a migraine and severe nausea. Luckily this round 3 I was able to just go right home and sleep. My doses are every 2 weeks for 4 rounds and can't wait to move onto Taxol, as they tell me it will be easier. I end up with nausea for 11 days and the shots cause bone pain and slight fever. My taste buds are off, the steroids keep me up, I get constipated. It is all no fun. With the first round I got thrush and mouth sores. My pharmacist suggested I suck on ice chips while chemo is delivered and it worked. I didn't get mouth sores round 2 and so far so good with round 3, although I'm only 5 days in. At this point I'm feeling blessed to get 3 good days before I go and do it again. Emotionally round 2 was tough because it was much harder. My hair started falling out Day 16 and I shaved it Day 17 which helped with tenderness. Remember every chemo journey and reaction can be different though. For me I'll be so glad to move on from AC.",
