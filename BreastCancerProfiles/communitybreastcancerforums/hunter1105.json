I'm super scared, not just for the surgery & pain but the pathology to have all the details that the doctors seem not completely sure of right now. I am having tissue expander placed -- I have cosmetic implants for 10 years now so I thought my reconstruction would be easier, but apparently not -- I still have to go through what everyone else has had to. I do have something happening that I have not read about on any of these discussion boards....my boyfreind of 4 years left & moved out shortly after my diagnosis. I'm 48 and have a 9 year old daughter I'm trying to raise by myself & no family nearby. I am a strong person, but all these things happening have made me feel so weak and unsure of everything. I want to be able to be there for my daughter so I hope my decision for surgery is the right one for me. Any words of encouragement would be so appreciated. God Bless all of You!",

Surgery may be hard, Pathology results to wait for are brutal, and treatment is a big black hole. We all have the same fears & are expecting the same miracles -- we shouldn't expect any less for ourselves or our sisters. ((Luvinmylife)) you are my soul sister it seems -- I am having exactly the same surgery as you on exactly the same day. My best support, only support is from God and my daughter (9) I am going to walk in that hospital and pray for the best for both of us so we can continue to be there for our young children. Thank you Maureen for the detailed list which shows this ridiculous disease has too many of us in hospital rooms in the next couple weeks -- I pray we all have the best possible outcomes & will continue to share so we are never alone:) xxxooo hunter1105",
