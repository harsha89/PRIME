The nurse who administered the CMF yesterday told me the last few people she had that took CMF did not lose their hair.  They had thinning.  I asked if I should order a wig and she told me not to.  Hair doesn't begin to thin or fall out after the 3rd or 4th treatment.  side effeccts aren't supposed to be so bad.  I did get a little woozy today but not bad. It only took about an hour to administer where the other is baout 2 1/2.  I am going for about 8 treatments.  One every three weeks. Hope this helps.",

I had a lumpectomy on 8/8/08, 1.2cm,stage 1, ER/PR+, Her2-, 0/7, grade 2 nodes and an oncotype score of 15.  They first called with my results and said I had a 9 so it was just going to be rad/tam.  Now I'm faced with new choices since it is a 15 and still considered grey. I am more or less being told it is a personal choice.  The 2 onc said if it was them, they would lean towards the chemo due to my age and family history.  Mom had BC.  Braca 1 neg, braca 2 was inconclusive. In discussing chemo, I have a choice of Taxatere or CMF.  I'm leaning towards the CMF since it seems less toxic.  They said it would be a dose every 3 weeks and there would 8 doses.  Still no guarantee I wouldn't lose my hair.  It would thin most likey.  I do have very thick short hair.  It is a longer regiment but they told me it only takes 45 min. to administer.  I am waitng for the result of another test, maybe it is aduvent to show me how much the chemo will truly help me.  Prayinghands...if a CAT scan is similar or the same as a CT scan (which I had) its nothing.  You drink barium, which doens't taste too bad) over a period of an hour before and the scan itself is only 7 minutes long.  I never found the tests for anything to be bad...its just the roller coaster ride of waiting for results ",

I'm now starting to worry that I won't be able to start until Nov.  How long is too long?  My lumpectomy was on 8/8??? I'm wondering if the tooth thing is sign telling me not to do the chemo?",

Mainly due to my age (46) and the size of the tumor.  Pre onco type they did chemo on any tumor over 1 cm.  Chemo only reduced my reoccurance by 3%. I know its not big but my likilhood of reccurance after onco was 9% with rad and tamoxofen.  Bringing it down to 6% sounds so much better.  You can always do a clinical trial.  That will make up your mind for you. My surgery was on 8/8 and didn't make up my mind until the beg. of Oct.  Keep in mind that people who get recontructed don't start a treatment until they are healed which takes time. Take your time and really think about it.  It may help to make a list of pros and cons. I searched for every reason to not do chemo.  Nothing convinced me 100%. I've begun CMF which doesn't seem as bad as other out there.  I'm doing great on it. Making my decision was very tough but I'm happy with it.",
