I was diagnosed with breast cancer in my right breast with involvement of nodes  in late May of 2013.  My care journey included 12 weeks of Chemo once a week, a decision to have a lumpectomy...and the pathology report from that surgery that showed me to be cancer free in Late November 2013...extraordinary outcome...had little side effects from chemo except fatigue and loss of hair:)) What made me different from many is I never felt panic or fear with the diagnosis, only a lets do this attitude and I picked an all female team who are bringing me through this experience beautifully. I start radiation next week for six weeks every day. I am taking the biologic Herceptin every three weeks for nine months and a hormone therapy pill...all to ensure cancer stays away.  Don't fear...be brave believe in yourself and your future . Get busy living and surviving this experience:))",

So when we are diagnosed, too often our first reaction is that we missed something we should have gotten that would have allowed us to avoid cancer! It's no one's fault...",

I will remain in a regime to kill the whole possibility of cancer in my bod...and my doctor told me that they do not use term remission. I am cancer free!  So grab this challenge with both hands...wrestle your fear to the ground and get on board with deciding to survive this challenge! God bless and good luck!",
