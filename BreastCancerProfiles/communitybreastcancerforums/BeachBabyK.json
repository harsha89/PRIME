I am really hoping this works out! A shorter treatment plan would be heavenly!

I am thinking about driving myself to round #2 and found like most others that Chemo day and a few days after are fairly \"normal\". The first one was not a difficult day, but extremely long (almost 7 hours for me) and I was thankful to have my Hubby pick me up at the end of the day. I am lucky though in that my treatments are in the same town and only a few miles away. I think if they were further, I wouldn't even consider it. I also have a port and that went fairly well, with just a bit of soreness and a stiff neck afterwards. No quick movements or trying to reach too much with the arm on that side. It makes the treatment day much easier, especially if, like me, not only did they prescribe the 6 rounds of chemo of the 4 drugs, but the Herceptin for an entire year. Now, hair loss. My Dr. guaranteed that I was lose my hair, so that day I came home and cut my long locks off to my shoulders. Since then, that is all I have been willing to do. I noticed that it was starting to come out a few strands at a time around Day 13 or so. Now it's coming out in bunches, and although I have the utmost admiration for those that can just own it and shave it all off, I'm just not there yet. I ordered a wig and have an appt for this week to pick it up. If you plan on getting one, you might want to order it sooner as opposed to later. As for now, I am super careful hen I brush it and and mostly keeping it pinned up. I am planning on going hat shopping this week. I knew this would be one of the hardest parts for me and that's proving true so far (at least emotionally). I think my hair represents normalcy to me and although going through treatments, I haven't been overtly public with my diagnosis and have only told a few of my closest friends in town. Once the hair goes, I feel like my diagnosis will no longer belong to me, but others will start to insert themselves, albeit well meaning. I am not fond of being a center of attention or a topic of conversation, so this part is harder to me than fighting the disease in some ways. The other struggle as I see it is time. Does anyone else find themselves counting days from/to the next treatment? I find it so nerve-wracking!!! Even with all of the other things going on in life, it seems like I am on a separate track, running along the same route, but not at the same speed as the train on the \"regular\" track. The destination seems sooo far ahead, but I can't make the train go any faster. :-( I have friends/family asking about the holidays and trying to plan and I am like \"ahhhh, I have to play that one by ear\". Round #1 went well enough, some SE, but definitely nothing tooo much to complain about, but I have no idea what the future treatments will be like! Cumulative fatigue, worse nausea, each time. My Dr says that most of his patients on TCHP only \"make it through\" 4 rounds of the treatment instead of the prescribed 6 rounds, so I am not quite sure how to take that (as permission or a challenge). Thank you Everyone for being here! It's pretty incredible to have a group of people that you know are going through the same things that you are. No matter how wonderful and supportive friends and family are, there are parts of the process that are very personal and can only be fully understood by those also going through it. Be strong and SE free!",

SimpleLife - Thank you so much for stopping by with the words of encouragement!! I have read through some of the older chemo groups to prepare myself as I started this process, but having someone tale the time to post and let us know there is a light at the end of the tunnel is so incredibly helpful!

I went ahead and scheduled #6 at the same time and I am happy that I will finish my \"ugly\" chemo 2 days earlier than originally planned! Now I just have to remember to get my labs 2 days earlier and that they are good to go for the day before Thanksgiving! Seq24 - My Potassium was low too (first concern I've had with labs-knock on wood). I now have a Rx too. Glad they were able to include it in the IV, but make sure they don't try to speed it up too much. I was low once after a surgery and they have me a bag of Potassium and it was incredibly painful (the Infusion nurse said it was because they ran it too quickly)! I ended up using my morphine drip (which I hadn't used for the recovery) just to take the edge off of the Potassium drip! Nadya- I completely understand your feelings. Sometimes you don't even realize how run down or discouraged you are feeling until you snap at someone and then you feel awful. Have a wonderful weekend Everyone!",

DennyJ - If you don't mind my asking, what type of surgery have you decided on? I originally thought it was a BMX all the way, and now I have been rethinking. I have so many questions for the surgeon and hope to be able to see a plastic surgeon before I make my decision too. I'm a beach girl too and think the beach vacation for peace of mind may be the perfect solution before your surgery. Smilethruthepain - I was thinking the same as far as recovery after surgery after going through chemo. I feel like I was so much stronger before I started chemo and would have had a much easier recovery.",

The Dr has not prescribed Neulasta for me yet, but I was speaking to the infusion nurse about it and for those of you that experience pain, she said there is a reduced dose alternative that you can ask for that may not hurt as much...just thought I'd pass that along. HopefulYogi- I have my port on the left too. Be careful with the seat belt and you might want to get one of those cushions that you attach to the belt. Also, an ice pack helped a lot when I first got the port in. seq24- I also refused to barely touch my hair in hope that some would stay longer, but alas it still falls out...and amazingly gets really tangled! I make sure to brush before I shower so that the shower isn't going to get clogged. I completely get where you are coming from. I am not a hat person and the wig I bought is very warm on my head and I'm just not comfortable with it yet. I have mostly been wearing baseball hats. I just signed up for one of the ACS classes and hope to get a \"better\" (more fitting?) wig that I will be comfortable wearing. But yes, \"it'll grow back\" it just great, but it seems like forever until it is even able to start growing back! BTW, for home I have been wearing caps that tie in back (like a doo-rag) that I found at Walmart for $2.50 ea. They are comfortable and breathe and cover my fuzzy mess. Are any of you taking vitamins or even iron? I asked the nurse about it, but she referred me to the DR, and I figured I'll just ask when I see him next Monday. Welcome JR74! Here's to a good week!",

It's the manner in which the study was done and therefore most oncologists continue with the protocol as prescribed. Herceptin will continue for the completion of a calendar year for most of us after the TCP portion is completed, but I agree Angela, perhaps they could make an exception in your case and stretch it out a bit if they think that will help. My MO told me even before I started TCHP that most in the trial did not make it through rounds 5 & 6, stopping the treatment after round 4, presumably due to the side effects. Mine have not been bad enough for me to consider stopping (as much as I would have loved to), but I undertstand it for those that have had a rougher go of it.",

I keep most things pretty close to the vest and up until the day I had the surgery for my port, hadn't told anyone but my immediate family (husband and kids).

Are you just set up for 8 treatments?

I was always partial to my boobs too, but they turned against me! :-) I still hide what I have from my kids under a hat or wrap, trying not to traumatize them to much (or at least that's what I tell myself). It might be fund to share the \"dyeing of the hair\" with your daughter. It may be a very nice transition for both of you... just don't wait too long! I consider Day 1 as Chemo day. I am on TCHP and my hair started coming out Day 13, by Day15 it was coming out in clumps :-( I haven't had an issue with ANY other hair falling out yet - I am on Day 6 of Round #2.

That eye twitching drives me a bit batty! I'll give some electrolytes a try. Dennyj- Stay positive! There is a light at the end of the chemo tunnel...and it is a bright sunshine that I cannot wait to bask in (with my hat off to get some color on my pale white head). Sam-thanks for the updates and info on the B6! I love that we have a husband here. All the best to Emily and to you! Misslil- I found that I was noticeably weaker at times and have tried to stay ahead of the nausea. Found myself a bit dizzy a couple of days to if I moved too fast... stayed closed to home those 2 days and had my son drive me to my weekly blood test. And I DEFINITELY want to keep the weight loss! You gotta come out on the + side of this with something,right? LynnC- Sorry about your results! I have BC in my family but BRCA came back negative. No other testing was done. I think as we learn more they will find more/different genes to test. Docmama- The bloody noses - Arrrrggghhh! Hoping to join the January BMX club! I want a BMX and my BS wants a lumpectomy. I see him just before Christmas, so hopefully I'll get that process moving. I don't think a final decision can be made until I speak with the PS about what they see the reconstruction options are. Hoping to check the surgery off the list in January so that I can \"push play\" again on my life. I hate feeling like it's on hold. I'm a little surprised about the early date for your surgery... most doctors seem to want to give 4-6 weeks to recover after the last chemo, but by 3 weeks out I have been feeling pretty good, so who knows? And although I am not a Seminoles fan, I am a HUGE college sports (yes almost all of them) fan and love when people sport their colors! I'll be watching the game too! Have a great weekend Sisters (& Sam)!",

I know both from my Hubby, kids, and friends' partners that they often express feeling helpless as there is not always a lot that they can do to directly help us as we go through the treatment. Just reading your words is very uplifting! Thank you for walking along this journey not only with Emily, but with all of us! When I was originally diagnosed, the Dr mentioned radiation as one of the steps, but that was also because he was recommending a lumpectomy. How many of you ladies that have had a BMX have needed radiation? Also, has anyone been advised/considered having their ovaries out too (mainly for the Her+ ladies, I guess)? I really want to be pro-active in my treatment and do whatever I can to deter any type of future re-occurrence. I do know a couple of ladies that also had hysterectomies a couple of years after having breast cancer, but each was for a different reason (BRCA positive & something else). Also, I've been told that chemo can bring on menopause...anyone heard/experienced that? At this point n my life, I'd actually consider that a blessing, but for a younger gal, that would be horrible! I know I am in for the long haul with the Herceptin chemo for an entire year, but the idea of being done with the more difficult parts sooner as opposed to later is so appealing. I figure that chemo with last through 2016 and hopefully lead to surgery in Jan 2017. Trying to look forward Hope all of your SE's are manageable and each day is better than the last!",

It's hard to tell people that you are done with chemo, but you are still having to get 1 chemo drug every 3 weeks until the end of August. I don't consider myself \"done\" until I don't have to drive to the infusion center every 3 weeks (and my ultimate goal of getting the port out because I no longer need it!). I also knew I wasn't through the round, just the infusion... the side effects were still upcoming. Don't let stories about others get you down! There are good and bad stories out there... take the good ones to heart! I hope the SEs are light! To all the Ladies that are on here I wanted to say Thank You!! You all helped me through one of the worst chapters in my life; having to get from diagnosis through chemo. You helped to keep me sane and I will never forget it! ",

The first couple days of chemo may be the only days for 2 weeks that you actually feel like eating. Once you get 4-5 days into it, especially if you have a platinum-based chemo drug, your taste buds are shot and NOTHING tastes normal, much less appetizing. There were days that I was lucky to get 500 calories in. I was constantly drinking water, but anything with flavor (like the recommended Gatorade or Vitamin water) tasted awful. Also, since I consider chemo poison, the hopes of getting the chemo out of me ASAP was always on my mind. You have to work everything through your system to do that. With less going in, there is less going out. My recommendation - Exercise, eat, drink. Do what you can when you can, because there will absolutely be days that you can't. I lost over 20 pounds during my 6 rounds of chemo and thankfully I had it to lose (could still afford to lose another 20), but I have known plenty of people that lost weight without being able to afford to lose a pound. Your chemo journey will inevitably include nausea, lack or hunger, lack of taste, and diarrhea - throwing fasting into the mix may exacerbate the situation. I understand the idea that it would help the chemo work, but the amount of treatments most people receive are more than sufficient/effective to do the job necessary. My tumor completed disappeared after the first few treatments. For most of you, chemo would be a secondary stop-gap to insure a reduced risk of recurrence. If you choose to fast, please check with your MO first and I would highly recommend that you go through your first round \"au naturel\" so that you can see how you are affected. I am still taking potassium supplements from my chemo treatments and my last one was 12/14 and some of my other counts are still low.",

For you ladies heading to/just started chemo, if you haven't shaved your hair yet, you can check out this site http://hairwithacause.com/index.html They can do extension with your own or donated hair. On the ovary-removal front...when I spoke with my MO about it he suggested (for me as I am still pre-menopausal) to delay it as long as possible as the ovaries help stave off other things like bone loss. He also said most of his patients do better on Tamoxifen than some of the AI's. Fightingirl - Sounds like the situation of thinking we all have the same journey and that we all heal the same. Hopefully, he takes the time to learn that is not the case and sticks to his original statement. Hoping for the best!  Well Ladies, I know it's a little early, but will you be my Valentine?

I had all boys (no grand babies on the horizon yet) and didn't get to play dress up with a darling girl. What a Blessing! Hoping she is out of the NICU very soon and on her way to Gowa's house! BTW, the abbreviation for the oncologist is usually MO (medical oncologist) as opposed to the RO (radiation oncologist). Welcome Lifeb4me! I am so happy if our conversations were able to help you in some way! I also completed neoadjuvant chemo before my lumpectomy. I recovered extremely well except that I developed a seroma that delayed my radiation... Hopefully you won't have that issue (if you are getting ready to climb on the radiation train. Don't apologize for being a hermit! We all deal with our diagnosis is different ways. I came here to share and commiserate as I haven't shared much with people is my life other than family and close friends. These Ladies are the best and I can honestly say have helped me through all of this! Annoyingboob - What did they find in the cranium of your's? Bet there's a direct connection to your funny bone!  Shelleybeans - Its always nice to have some handsome firemen to lighten up an evening! 3Bears & Pugsmama - hope all is well with your chemo and that your SE's are minimal!

I really want to just call it a day and tell the Dr. that I'm done. Funny thing is, I didn't feel this way when I was doing chemo. Maybe it's just the \"fatigue factor\" of dealing with one treatment or another for 8 months... who knows! I am already trying to figure out how to work tanning salon trips into my schedule once I'm done in hopes of evening out my skin tone. I am seriously dark on my right side and I am still scheduled for 13 more treatments. Docmama, my chemo sister - Never feel guilty about telling the truth. If it happens, you are not the person that got your co-worker fired, they are. We all make choices in life. Stealing from a awesome woman that just kicked Cancer's ass gets you some bad karma!! A-boob I would give anything to be at the Cabana right now with a fruity drink in my hand! Vargadoll-have that \"golf ball\" checked out! My seroma cost me several weeks of delay in my treatment. Best of luck to all of you that are progressing through reconstruction! For those Ladies finishing up Chemo, please remember that once you get through that last dose, you will still need time to process it through and to continue to take it easy and take care of yourself! I was surprised by how long it took for my body to get back to normal (especially some of the lab numbers). Blessings everyone! Keep us updated on your successes!",

Dsmom - I think your's is a decision that we have all had to struggle with! In my case, the Dr wants to do a lumpectomy (and has actually scheduled it for Friday) and I am fighting for a BMX. Not sure why I am having to fight for it, but I am hoping that when I see the Plastic Surgeon this week that she will be on my side! Vargadoll - I actually shared my diagnosis with very few people. I told my family,of course (which is so incredibly hard to do), but not too many others. If people asked me about it, I was forthcoming, but didn't make any announcements or Facebook posts or anything. I took a leave from my work and only advised them that it was for health reasons. They do not need the gritty details. To me, my diagnosis is personal, the fact that so many people can figure it out due to hair loss bugs me. I am a very private person and cancer has taken that away from me in a way and I hate it! Fightingirl - my reasons for wanting a mastectomy are multiple. I have \"very dense and lumpy breasts\" as I have been told every year during my annual exam. My MO even went around my breast during one exam pointing out all of the lumps that could be tumors when he couldn't feel my tumor anymore (it sounds bad, but it was more of a \"man, I get why it's hard to tell\" thing). I have never had a mammogram where I have not had to go back for further screenings and have had previous scares (both breasts). My Gma on one side had breast cancer and on the other had Ovarian. I also do not want to go through radiation if I don't have to as it's a one-shot deal. My cancer was also very aggressive. Also,I am 47 and have recovered well from previous surgeries. I just don't want to have to stress year in and year out more than I am already forced to do.",

I also have a blue boob (started out only as a ring around the nipple) due to the dye working it's way through. I still have quite a bit of swelling and bruising at the lowest part of my breast on the side where fluid has collected. I took a shower this morning and am feeling good. Wearing a bra (no wires) and button up shirts just so that I don't have to lift the arm up too much. Didn't sleep great, but don't think I'll need any more pain meds, unless I overdo it. Thinking of seeing a movie today as it's rainy here in So. CA and I figured I'll be sitting on my butt anyway, might as well seem something new. I hope that your sister makes it there soon DocMama and that anyone in the area that will be hit by the storms coming through are safe and sound. I know we are supposed to get a huge rainstorm (not just the regular So. CA freakout, but supposedly the biggest rainstorm in 10 years). I'm sure as it moves east it will wreak havoc too. For those of you that missed out on the Costco shirts like me, if you have time, check out Walmart.com. I found a few that I had shipped to my local store for around $6-$6.50. They are pretty thin material, but many of you will have additional layers on if you are going out anyway. The will also ship them for a fee. 3bears - I find myself doing the same thing (giving hubby updates) and I'm not sure if he thinks I'm crazy that one can care about people so much that one has never met, but he is happy that I have friends that understand things he may not be able to quite get. Please everyone in the snow and crazy weather, be safe!",

I am also a lumpectomy gal and the surgery went well and recovery was pretty easy. My incision is healing nicely and the only issue I have is that I am still pretty swollen. I hope that your surgeries go as well! Many of us were given grade/stages before surgery, but sometimes they are revised after, so don't about that too much...you'll get that determination soon. Alli - congrats on moving onto the next step! I know having another surgery already many seem daunting, but just keep checking the items that have been completed off and know you are that much closer to being done! lovesgreenthings- praying for clear margins too. I try to always be optimistic myself! Did-not-see-this-coming - Don't overdo it! Annoyingboob- Thanks for the article. I am a \"large-chested\" gal (although not THAT large) and I was told that they really couldn't \"do\" nipple-sparing for me (Although that made me question the PS's abilities more than anything else as I know other similarly chested gals that had nipple sparring with immediate reconstruction). Pyrrh & Fightingirl - Please keep up (or at least me) updated on your brachytherapy! Is it the balloon type? Just 5 days? As I know radiation is part of my plan, I would love to reduce the amount of time devoted to it. I meet my RO on Wednesday.",

Her response was \"your cancer is gone, where would we place the implant\" Isn't that the case for EVERY single patient that has brachytherapy after a lumpectomy??? I am mnore than frustrated - first the mastectomy thing and now this. It didn't help that I wasn't even moved to an exam room util an hour after my scheduled appt. Then the questions... when did you first start your period, etc. etc. ? (Please someone explain what that has to do with radiating my breast???) Ok, done with the rant! (sorry, I reeeeeaaaaallllly needed to do that!) Happy to hear from all of our surgery ladies from this week and please know that every day will get better. Celebrating drains out, showers, clean nodes and great pathology reports! Bdagal - Yay for people making you feel special and letting you know that you are valued - never forget it! Surgery on your birthday... not sure how I would feel about that, but take it as the perfect day to start your cancer-free life!! I'm not sure how big the mass the Dr plans on taking out, but my PS told me that most of the BS are good at moving the tissue around so that you can't tell that they even did surgery, so continue to be optimistic! Docmama - ahh, the quarterly echo! Hope all is well! Amul79 - The port is wonderful for chemotherapy! I never had numbing cream, but the needle insertion is just a little pinch. The line into my neck never bothered me, so if it continues, please let your Dr know! The only irritation I've had since the initial installation is that sometimes when you move the wrong way, you notice it pull just a little. Dafne - so sorry about your delay, but completely understand sticking with a Dr that you are comfortable with! Vargadoll - I was part of the Chemo in Sept thread and would highly recommend a similar thread to anyone that has to undergo that treatment. Like here, you will find ladies in the same boat and be able to ask about side effects that you have and get great feedback about how to combat them! I've never been on a cruise either.. Hubby & I planned one for our 25th anniversay, but BC decided to interfere and it got postpone until ?? Pyrrh - Sometime I think that Dr's forget that we have lives! They have their Standard operating procedure and don't want to deviate from it. This group will stay here for as long as we choose to keep it active! There are those of us that have already navigated chemo that can answer question if any of you end up having to go through that aspect of treatment (although I am hoping that you don't) ",

When I started, if I had it now, did I have it through chemo, when did I start birth control, when did I stop? Am I sure I'm still having my period? Really... yeah I'm sure! I'm only 47, is is THAT uncommon to still have a period? Will I be put on hormone blockers? How many times have I been pregnant? Number of children? I'm thinking I'll bring them to my next appointment and introduce her. It would be one thing if she was my GP, but she will be a short-term doc (and she is not even my doc, but just a stand in for the day). While giving me my exam, she notice a scar around my belly button and started interrogating me about it... I completely put her off on that one.",

I am finally starting the Rads phase of my treatment and completed my simulation yesterday. Now I get to wait for the phone call to schedule after they work out the treatment plan. So, Cowboy-up... I am right here with you and hoping to start next week with you and most likely Tamoxifen around the same time. Elem - a \"round\" of chemo is usually one treatment. I was prescribed 6 rounds, one every 3 weeks. The round of treatment for me lasted about 5 1/2 hrs (other than the initial treatment which was 7 1/2 hrs.) Of course that all depends on your protocol. Some people receive treatment every week. 3bears - you look beautiful! I wish my wigs looked half that good. I think I am just wig-averse, problem is that I am bald-averse too! Hats are my friend right now. Have a wonderful weekend Lovely Ladies! Be Well!",

After that my skin started to peel and I got a sore up at my collarbone. Shortly after I developed similar sores under the crease of my breast and at the bend of my underarm (the radiation apparently likes skin folds). Hopefully, you don't have enough treatments to get to the point of skin sores!!! If I had been able to stop at 22, it would have been a walk in the park!! 5 and counting!",

If it was just a \"friend\" making the comment, my advice would be to let it go, but as it was one of your best friends, the next time it comes it (as it seems to unfortunately whether you like it or not), I would just let him know that hearing stories about people that had cancer and died is not helpful or empowering to someone living with it. Also comparing people's journeys really isn't fair, maybe his other friend doesn't mind discussing the trials that you have chosen to go through silently. Also, that it is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life and will worry about every little twinge or pain that the cancer has returned. You have been forever changed. Maybe someone else will bring up the Big C in is company and you can share your journey and he'll be enlightened. I'm at the point, 10 months into my journey that more people are finding out about my diagnosis. I am out and about in larger groups more with Kid's sporting events and although I always wear a hat, I hate the wigs and now that I have hair, I go without the wigs, but as my hair was halfway down my back (at its shortest, never above my shoulders), it's a bit obvious that something has changed. I am honest about it when asked, so little by little my \"condition\" (as it was referred to yesterday) is being disseminated among our community. That part I hate. I don't want to be \"the lady that had BC\" I just want to be \"me\". I think people get nervous and flustered when they find out or deal with someone that has been \"sick\". They just lose their shit (I mean sensibilities), and become stone cold idiots and tend to just vomit out of their mouths without thinking. My policy now is to say what I feel at the time... for those that care, they will learn something and may treat the next person they meet in our situation with a little tact and compassion. Most importantly, WE know what WE have been through. Not even our caregivers and loved ones, understand the sleepless nights, worrying about how to care for our families when we should be taking care of ourselves, the dread for the next test, the toll chemo and radiation took on our bodies, both seen and unseen, the countless doctor's appointments, blood tests, body scans, the surgeries, the missed holidays, birthdays, etc. The fact that our diagnosis date will forever be embedded in our brains and all the rest that comes with it. WE will never minimize what you have been through. Or the strength you had to fight through it. Love all you Ladies for the strength and courage you have all shown to help others on a similar journey through one of our live's great trials. Thank you all!",

I am horrible at waiting around! A little anxious about the \"wire\" deal and dye injection, but if you can get through the rest of the package that comes with our diagnosis, that will be no big deal, right? Glad to hear those of you that have had surgery are checking in and doing well! PugsMama, the drains are inconvenient more than anything else and they help with healing. So glad to hear that you guys are having to wait for results either! My BS had me make an appt to see him next week when I'll get mine - figures as my biggest pet peeve with the medical community is having to wait for results that the Dr already has but hasn't bothered to share with you! Irony is a funny thing! Can't wait to have the cancer gone!!! Quick healing Everyone!",

Went in for a mammogram (to be used for wire and dye placement) but they couldn't find the clip that was supposed to be placed at the biopsy. Sent me for an ultrasound, no luck there either. I was told that they don't think it was placed properly during the biopsy and it was caught during my first MRI but no one listened to the radiologist that said they needed to place another one. Oy! Well, they did their best and placed the wire and did the dyed injection then I got another mammogram to make sure everything was ok. Should be heading to the surgery center soon! Good luck my fellow patients!",

For those of you with surgeries coming up soon, please try and relax- as many of us can attest to, the worrying ends up being worse than reality. DCISinAZ- A friend of mine (BC survivor) recommended that I take a pic before surgery and I did,just for me. I think it may be useful in the grieving/healing process for many people, and it can't hurt,right? Fightingirl - I knew it was something silly! It's Murphy's Law, right? So glad for the best news! 3Bears - I am so sorry! I can truly feel your disappointment! I was originally hoping for a BMX with immediate reconstruction and if it hadn't worked out,it would have been a major set back,to say the least. Please know that 6 weeks seems like such a long time, but in the scheme of things, it will end up being the blink of an eye. You are in my thoughts! PugsMama - Glad they are doing a MammaPrint! My MO didn't even do an Oncotype, maybe because they did chemo first and wasn't up for discussion. I hope that you don't need chemo, but if you do, know that you will get through it too and we are here for you! DocMama- I am so sorry to hear about your sister! That was my biggest fear when diagnosed and while waiting for the BRCA results. They came back negative, but I hate that her BC chances are now higher. I don't know how confident I am in the genetic testing yet, but at least I know that she will be diligent about getting mammograms! Stay well and as far away from your sick loved ones and you can! For all of you that are fighting to heal...keep fighting!",

Laastra - I'm sorry to hear about you having to deal with BC at such a young age. I hope that chemo is not in the picture and that after your surgery life can continue down the path that it was meant to take before BC decided to force you onto a side road. The side roads are not what we planned, but sometimes there are things you see and do on that road that can actually make your life better that you expected. The last few months, while going through treatment I have gotten closer to my kids and reconnected with some good friends. It's been nice. I've also learned who I won't be wasting much time on in the future, but I see that as a positive too! I have \"met\" some of the most amazing ladies both sitting next to me in the chem chair as well as on this board and I have shared things with them that I wouldn't share with people that I've known for years! Laughing is what has kept me sane through all of this, so I guess I'll be checking out Tig soon! Best of luck on Monday!",

      "Content": "Jan 17, 2017 12:37PM BeachBabyK wrote: The recurrence rate for a mastectomy is statistically the same as a lumpectomy + radiation. I was not thrilled with my Dr's insistence on doing a lumpectomy for many reasons, but if I had a 25% chance of recurrence, I would not have allowed it. I also did a boob selfie and when I went to find a pic they popped (haha!) up and I quickly sent an email to myself and deleted them from my phone.... just..... in.... case! Welcome newbies! Steph - I had chemo first and was blessed to have a complete pathological response, therefore the surgeon didn't have to take too much breast tissue to remove all of the effected tissue and get good margins. I had my lumpectomy on the 6th and I can't yet tell you what my breast will ultimately look like as it is still swollen (he only made one incision and removed tissue and lymph nodes through it), but I have complete feeling and no worries about losing skin. That said, I did originally want a BMX, but trusted (reluctantly) my Drs opinions that the lumpectomy would ultimately have a better outcome (the outcome weighed heavily on my decision). Remember that if you choose a mastectomy and go with implants, they will have to be replaced every 10-15 years. For me, my breast size factored heavily and the PS said they would not be able to match my current size and that nipple/skin sparring would probably not be an option. Make sure you speak with both your BS & PS about the outcome and possibilities. I truly trusted my Drs otherwise I would have been much more adamant about the BMX. Bevmomduck - Sorry to hear that Hubby had a hard time. I think having a wife with BC is so hard for most men as they want to be able to DO something and there is so little that they can do that they feel has a direct impact. They have to often sit back and watch their wives suffer and it is extremely hard. I know that having to be strong for others can be draining, but we are all here to help you be strong! DCIsinAZ - I first saw that pic on my phone and thought you posted an actual boob pic! It took me a minute for it to register! Fightingirl - I am amazed at how I have lost my inhibitions through all of this. I barely let the Dr walk out of the room before I whip off my shirt & bra! In regards to surgery...Are you still really swollen? I feel like I have a boob and a half on my surgery side! Other than that, healing is great - no pain, incision looks good. Just currently the owner of 2 1/2 boobs. :-) I would vote for a private FB page too!!",

I think we should just start a group called \"The Waiting Room\" DocMama - I have so little experience with wine but I am all for popping a cork in celebration! Glad that you have some bumps... you've earned them! I also have a seroma, and they had to drain 200 cc last week (that is what your Dr put in to your TEs combined!) Unfortunately, it has filled up again (though not nearly as big) and I am going in again on Wednesday. I need to get my girls back to where they are the same size! Not sure if you've had any SE on the Herceptin, but I've done much better this round than last one (not sure if it was just a hold over from everything or not). Keep those chins up Ladies!

Shelleybeans, I'm sorry about getting sick right after! Bad enough you were just out of surgery! I guess I'm lucky that I knew anesthesia makes me nauseous - of course I found out DURING my first C-section and I vomited in the middle of it! Hard to do strapped to the table like Christ! I agree with PugsMama... ask for anti-nausea meds, just in case! Lisabekind - listen to your gut. If I had surgery first, I would have had a BMX, but as I had such great result with the chemo, I listened to my Drs recommendations and went with a lumpectomy, but my feelings had also changed (as did the amt of tissue they were planning to remove). jrow7 - yes, if the lumpectomy is sizable and depending on the size of your breast, a lumpectomy can be close to a mastectomy. Originally the Dr had stated they would take 1/4 of my breast and I said take it all... they ended up only removing a very small amount of tissue and it didn't make much of an impact to my DDs, so it worked out. Had they still wanted to remove the 1/4, I would have bushed for a BMX. I waited to make mu final decision until I had a chance to speak with a PS so that I could get my questions answered. I recommend the same if you are unsure of what to do. For those of you needing radiation, same thing do your research and then fight for what you want. I just made another appt with my RO to discuss brachytherapy! Hopefully he is on board! Waiting on one more 1/30 check in and best wishes to our 1/31 ladies!!",

My husband was surprised I didn't get one with my lumpectomy and now I wish I had gotten one as I have had to go into the Dr's office twice to have a seroma drained (200 cc's the first time) and it is already filled back up. I think that the main thing is that you were given a set of expectations and now they have changed. That totally sucks and can be incredibly disappointing. It's one of the reasons why doctors often do not give possibilities without having all of the details. Please don't get too far ahead of the process! I met woth my RO today and HE doesn't do brachytherapy. After hearing from a couple of wonderful ladies here, I contacted my other doctors and asked for names of ROs that do... I am still waiting (it was just today), but I am hoping to get one and that it all works out. If not, I'l be doing 2 months of regular radiation.... I have no advise on the lifting thing ...you have to make sure to heal before you can take care of others. Keep your chin up!!",

Cowboy Up...what day are you starting? Glad to have someone on the same timeline to commiserate with! Love the haircut! Can't wait until my hair is long enough to cut again! Shelleybeans- eat whatever you can! Talk about gross, while on chemo one of the only things I could eat was Chef Boyardee Raviolis, but there were days that I was happy to get the 440 calories in. Get the IV fluids even if you don't need them- I did and it helped to stave off any dehydration from the diarrhea. And yes! Count each and every week off as you go... the number getting smaller and smaller is SOOOOO nice to see! Bevmomduck - you are in my thoughts daily! PugsMama - Hoping for diminished SE's this time around! Rest when you feel tired/week and don't overdo it! I got caught overdoing it one day... scared me to death and I was thankfully with family. Listen to your body! Vargadoll - Cobbler, yum! Sounds like we have a new dessert (for the still eating sugar gals) in the Cabana! I haven't decided whether or not to get the tattoos. I need to see hog big and where they would be. I really don't want a reminder of the BC, but if they are small enough I just might do it... i don't mind the tape and sharpie route too much.

I was told that it was automatic for someone diagnosed with BC (in the US) that is under 50 with few/no BC in family. Insurance covered the cost for me because of this (I later found out, that family members did have cancer, but not enough to not do the test). Win-chimed and others awaiting possible treatment protocol snow that you have had surgery- please remember that chemo and radiation also has the purpose of keeping any possible stray cancer cells from spreading as the Dr.s cannot be sure that they were able to get out each and every cell. The chemo treatment the oncologists choose is based on the type of cancer (I was triple positive) as well as the grade/aggressiveness (mine was grade 3/very aggressive). I completely understand wanting to avoid chemo- who the hell wouldn't? - but it is one of the best ways to keep down the chance of recurrence. If you end up needing chemo Ladies, please know that we will all still be here for you! I actually envy those of you sharing how much better you felt after washing your hair since surgery... I really miss washing my hair and how it felt! I'm still waiting for it to start growing again...Can I get a prayer for that?! Vargadoll - I had my lumpectomy on 1/6. I wanted a BMX, but my BS really pushed and was adamant that he didn't want to do it, he wanted to save the breast. I would have pushed but the PS didn't believe that I would have a good outcome with the BMX either- definitely not nearly as good an outcome as I would with the lumpectomy (\"because I am large breasted\"), so I decided to trust my doctor and do the lumpectomy (and raise pure HELL if it didn't come out the way I wanted). So far, so good. I think it was good for you to wait to tell family until you had all of the info. It's hard enough to share your diagnosis without having the basic answers to the questions that you know will come. Share when you are ready. I didn't tell anyone outside my immediate family until just before I started chemo. I waited to tell the more distant family until I had already had a few treatments. I just told a couple of friends just the other day after I had surgery. No one was upset that I hadn't told them sooner (and if they had been I would've explained that my diagnosis is a personal thing). How old are your nieces? If they are old enough to understand and love and support you, then yes, I would tell them. My nieces were so incredibly supportive and awesome throughout my entire treatment and understood some of the \"girl stuff\" that my sons certainly couldn't :-) I would also say to make sure to share your diagnosis (even if it's sometime in the future) with those that are genetically related to you so that they can properly assess their own risk - It wasn't until after my diagnosis that I was finally told that BOTH of my grandmothers had cancer... I had been told my entire life that there was no cancer in my family. Argh! Bevmomduck - Yay!!! So glad to hear! DCISinAZ - prepare to pee blue! bccpa - Yes, you will have days where you feel strong and then all of a sudden feel like all of your energy is gone. I think it has to do with the emotional toll that finding out you have cancer takes on you. Welsome to the Newbees!",

Dreamer - ask away and we will give you our honest take! PugsMama - Thank you for posting the freebie link. For all of out MX and BMX ladies, I believe that Nordstroms have a program where they give you 3 free bras a year. Not sure what you have to do, but worth looking into! Also MX sisters if you are having mobility problems, please ask for your Dr to prescribe PT. I have sisters that have benefited greatly and it's definitely worth asking about. Stellamonsterr - I know it can be a daunting decision, but for me the final decision came down to what the BS & PS said the best possible outcome would be. I am large-breasted and apparently that can cause problems with reconstruction (seems like it would be better, but apparently not). The amount of tissue to be removed was not great and would not make too much of an impact overall. My BS in known for doing a great job in making the breast look good after surgery, so I trusted him. I am not thrilled about radiation, but I've spoken with people that have gone through it and know it is doable and worth the reduced risk of recurrence. DocMama- There will still be some fluid buildup, but if they removed your drains, they feel that it is only as much as your body can handle... that certainly doesn't mean it will be comfortable! This lumpy gal is still so swollen almost 2 weeks after surgery that I almost wish they would stick a needle in there and drain it. I feel like I have at least a boob and a half on my surgery side. I hope that everyone is healing well and improving every day!",

DCISinAZ - sorry for the scare! Vargadoll - Yay for weights being lifted off of your shoulder! I haven't really looked into the estrogen blocking drugs yet either, although my MO mentioned he would probably have me start during radiation. So many people have different reactions, I'm hesitant to read about all of the SEs in fear that I will cause them to happen. Annoyingboob - Your pics are awesome! Always make me smile. Dafne - I hope that you are able to get on the schedule ASAP. The waiting game is the worst! I hope that your help with the scans are able to improve diagnoses for future patients! Feel good about doing something positive! Try not to get down, just check off each day as it comes. laastra - Glad everything went well! CLEAR NODES! Take it easy while you can. 3bears - I am so sorry about the expander issue. I have a feeling that I would have had issues if I had gone ahead with a BMX - just my luck. I wonder if my family name should actually be Murphy sometimes! jinmo - \"mutant uprising\" is a perfect description -I'm glad you shared it (and tried to give credit). Of course, now that gives those X-man movies a completely different meaning. I laugh when I read all of the theories of how we managed to get cancer (Did you keep your phone in your bra? -NO, Do you eat sugar?-of course, etc.) pyrrh - Watch out for those drawstrings! Isn't funny the weird ways we manage to hurt ourselves? Like when you see a bruise and you can for the life of you remember how you got it. Win-chimed - what type of cancer do you have? Some of us (myself included) have already been down the chemo road and may be able to help out with some of your questions. Becmomduck - I hope that you had a wonderful birthday! Sounds like you raised those daughters right. My kids have kept me sane through all of this. I love them more than they will ever know! Elem - Try not to get stressed! (I know it's easy to say and harder to do). The aggressiveness really depends on the type of cancer (from what I understand). Mine was very aggressive, but we managed to kick it's a$$ anyway!!! Cowboy-up - Sorry that you are having a rough time, but don't be hard on yourself! Our bodies all react differently. Glad that the Tylenol helps. I try to stay away from the Rx unless absolutely necessary. I hope that everyone is staying away from the dark place. I've been lucky and managed to avoid it, but I know sometimes you find yourself starting down that fork in the road...That's what we are here for! Have a great weekend, don't overdo, hug your furry baby and have a bowl of Tillamook!",

I have finished my year of Herceptin and have my surgery scheduled to get my port out NEXT WEEK! Graduation!!! The port was the first thing I had done and really signifies to me that my (major part of) treatment is over! Can you say FINISH Line, Baby! Whoo Hoo! Other than Tamoxifen and regular check up, this gal is living an almost normal life! I also had my mammo (ALL CLEAR!). Happy for all of you working through the reconstruction process! It's almost like Oprah stopped by and said \"You get new boobs, and you get new boobs!\" I hope it is all quick and painless and the results make you smile when you look in the mirror! So glad to hear that everyone is safe and sound and hoping that the other storms out in the Atlantic decide to fizzle and die away! 3Bears - I am right there with you on the hair thing. I have been going without a hat since my family vacation at the end of July, but I feel like a boy and of course the front is the shortest because I want it to be the longest. :-) But like you said, it's hair and I am beyond happy to have it!  On the Christmas Card list idea... If you would like to participate, please DM me your (real) Name, address, and email. I'll compile a file and send it out next month. Happy almost Autumn!!!  ",

If you are interested, just PM me your name, address and email (for delivery). I'll try to send it out by the end of the weekend.  My Dr has not recommended the removal of my ovaries or uterus, so I am going to keep them for now. I get hot flashes from the Tamoxifen (or should I say the forced menopause) and originally was given Venlasflaxine to help - which it did in the beginning, but not quite as much now. Debating what to do about it (try to get a stronger prescription, just stop taking it, try another drug to offset the hot flashes?). I will stick with the Tamoxifen for now. Please continue to post about your milestones, anniversaries, test results, good days and bad! We are still here and I still read each and every email notification to find out how you are all doing. Next month will be a biggie for all of us and I hope that everyone stops by to let us know how they're doing. Docmama - Did you do the Trial? If so, please keep us updated! Also, please post more beautiful pics! I have a frriend heading to Europe next year and she wants a companion... I'm seriously thinking about it!!! BTW, I love your hair! You look great! PugsMama- So thankful that a year later you are here and decorating for Christmas! I wasn't much into it last year either (and haven't started the inside of the house yet), but I feel truly Blessed and to have had all of you to hold my (virtual) hand through all of this! Bevmomduck - It's so hard to say what the \"cancer-free\" mark is! We (Hubby & I) determined that we are going to use my surgery date as there is no way to pinpoint that during the chemo, so I am just over a month away! And it's not negativity... it's reality and why we are here for each other! It's the reality that is different from anyone else's that hasn't been through this. Annoyingboob - Always love your pics! Thankfully, the weather in So CA is still nice and I am enjoying the \"cooler\" nights. Love to all!!   ",

I've heard that fatigue is definitely a factor, but that it takes a couple of weeks to hit (kind of an accumulation type thing). Most said that work was definitely doable. My only other comment is about the time for radiation. Although the actual treatment may take 10 min, I've heard to give them at least a 1/2 hr as the machine has to be cleared, tested, and then programmed with your info, they have to put you into the machine and get you set up, all before the 10 minutes of treatment. And that's if they work on time. I just want you to give enough time to get to where ever you need to go. I mean with my RO tomorrow (he was MIA at my first appt). I will find out my own course of treatment then and we can compare. :-)",

Please know that as horrible as the prospect of chemo is, It is just another hurdle for you to jump on the way to full health! Or you can run right through the damn hurdle, but either way, you'll get to the finish line. 3Bears -people say the dumbest things. There are at least 2 topics on here for them and they are worth reading through...some of the comebacks are just classic! PugsMama- My surgical nurse did tell me to \"shave\" with an electric razor only after surgery. The funny thing is, since I started chemo, I really haven't needed to shave...no hair growth! Fightingirl - NO ONE can understand what we are going through unless they have gone through it!! You do not share everything with any one human being. It's a burden that is hard to put on anyone. Loved ones do what they can, and it helps immensely, but the thoughts, fears, and emotions that we go through is unique to someone that is experiencing it. And each of our experiences is different! Varga - Praying for your Mom! She is one of our own! My favorite response for someone that tries to tell you why you got cancer (overweight, phone in bra, poor diet, birth control pills, etc.) is that it's caused from good meaning people trying to diagnose us without medical training... Have a wonderful weekend Ladies!!! Enjoy the game (if you watch) and all of the yummy food that goes with it!",

They genuinely care about you as a human being. As much as I hated going for chemo, I loved visiting with my nurses and other chemo sisters. There is one lady I met there that I absolutely love so much that we schedule our Herceptin together every 3 weeks so that we can touch base. I rarely got much done during chemo,,, choosing to socialize with my fellow infusionists. Shelley - I didn't have a chemo class or any type of introduction as the infusion room is actually at the MO's office in my case, but I would have had a very hard time having to walk around with other future chemo patients feeling like everyone knew why I was there. There are so many times that you just want to do what you need to do and go on with your day. Jump outta the fishbowl and flop your way to the ocean! DCIS - I had BRCA testing. Mainly because I was \"under 50 and have BC\". My test came out negative. One og my Gma's had BC, the other had ovarian cancer. Not sure how confident I am in the test, but it was nice for peace of mind. No Tamoxifen board for me... I figure I'll stay here and commiserate with my Ladies! I'd rather go through the rest of this ride with you! :-)",

I just completed #16 of 36 today and so far I have experienced no pain or irritation whatsoever. By looking at the skin, you can see some darkening of the area and I am just starting to experience some fatique (but as I have horrible sleep patterns I don't necessarily want to attribute that to the treatment). As for what happens... I get called in and change into a gown (top only off). I lay down on the machine and the techs line me up. They leave the room and treatment starts. For me, I have 7 phases (or treatment points). Each of the treatment points delivers 2 treatments that last 16-36 seconds each (yes, I count them each and every time). There is no burning or other \"feeling\" the treatment. It's just like when you get an X-ray, but for a longer period of time. They also take X-rays after every 5th treatment (with the same machine). After each pair of treatments in one area, the machine rotates a bit and starts again. You have to remain still during the entire treatment cycle. From dressing to treatment and back to dressing room, it takes about 15 minutes (yes, I timed it.) For the chemo ladies, so glad to hear that you are almost done! Hoping you are SE-free! For all of the ladies still waiting, for reconstruction, for a treatment to start, just to feel normal again, remember we are all here for you!",

Just breathtaking when you think about it! It must have been nice to have that acknowledged in such a way. 100 pages Ladies! Thank you for playing along and being there for each other each and every day! When I started the thread, I could never have imagined that we would get here and have so much fun doing it along the way! You have been some of the most supportive, incredible Ladies that anyone could ever have the pleasure of \"knowing\". I hope that someday we can all meet up and have a drink on the beach!

And I still haven't (and won't) be reading the Tamoxifen SE page either! DcBc - Summer of Susan looks like it was a success!! I was able to alleviate the night sweats by taking Effexor (no other side effects). Elem - just remember that the co-pays, tests etc. will lessen over time and there will even be times that we forget about breast cancer! BUT, we will always be close by! A-boob - If you migrate to France, you may have to get an extra room for your Sisters to come and visit!! Fightingirl - I am so sorry to hear about your interaction with your MO. Why can't Dr's realize that we are the ultimate deciders of how we choose to live our lives? He had no right to make disparaging comments! I appreciate that you respect his opinion, but he also needs to respect your's! I am one of those overthinking people that runs through conversations like that 100 times before I broach the subject, but it never goes as expected! Vargadoll - Tamoxifen took care of my period too... Nothing since Jan except for hot flashes :-) 3bears - I hope that you got some advice for the lymphedema! Sept 7 is coming up fast - make sure you let us know how it goes! Bevmom- Hope the arm is healing well! Is the wedding this weekend? Docmama! - Love this pick and the stone you picked! Sorry about the asthma, but glad that you were properly diagnosed. ... you are right though... every day is a new normal! DCIS - Hope all went well with the imaging! Gearing myself up for my 30th HS reunion this weekend. Nothing like seeing a bunch of people you haven't seen in years after beating BC and only having a couple of inches of hair on your head! :-) I haven't attended any of the previous reunions, so I convinced a couple good friends to go with me so that I couldn't back out. I decided to out myself (about the BC) on FB about 2 weeks ago to help cushion the blow and hopefully reach out to someone that may need support in the future... paying it forward for all of the love & support both here and offline. Only positives so far! Love to all! ",

Pugsmama - I'm glad you are taking a day to pamper yourself before your surgery! It always make me feel better! Fightingirl - If you find that crystal ball, let me know! Go with your gut and be confident with your decision! DsMom- That is similar to the way it was in the US a while ago. Surgery was often the first step and then the remaining treatments were figured out afterwards. Now they tend to cater the treatment to the type of cancer found. Communication by doctors (both with each other and with their patients) are one of my biggest pet peeves with the entire process. They seem to forget the anxiety that comes along with all of the tests and the process in general. Sr2295 - Let me know your date once you meet with the BS and I'll add you to the schedule. Vargadoll - I did tell my entire family about my diagnosis, but I did wait until I had all of the info. I waited to tell the non-immediate family members until I got my port in - it was more real then and closer to when something would actually be happening (chemo in my case). I really appreciate the way everyone has been here to support each other! I share more with you Ladies than I do with many of my friends, probably because you have a similar experience. Whatever the reason, I appreciate all of you and your willingness to share and support each other through all of this madness.",

For those of you heading into surgery next week, the wire and dye were just like a regular needle prick and were no big deal (for me anyway, considering the area)! The pain isn't too bad, but I was advised to stay ahead of the pain, so I took a pill (Norco) when I got home. I am using an ice pack and that helps quite a bit. I am trying to eat something but took a Zophran first as I was feeling a little nauseous (from not eating, anesthesia, or the combo). I don't have any dressing but have dermabond and can tell that I am pretty swollen. Vargadoll - now that I've done the wire, I think you'll be fine driving from the office. They place it and then tape it down. Once it is secured, you can move around with not much problem, just take care on that side (Maybe drive primarily with your other hand). I went from one building to the other with it in. FYI, once it was placed, they did another mammogram to make sure it was placed properly. They let me keep the films and I brought them home to show my kids. Oh,I see you had a couple of questions so here is my experience - They cut along the sides to minimize the scarring, the cut around the clip (well that's what they were supposed to do) only enough to cut out the left over cell remnants along with a little extra to make sure they've gotten it all. They dye lets them know what lymph nodes to take (I wasn't told yet how many they took, but I should find out next week) Then they stitch you up. I don't have drains, I don't think we need them as we do not have the same amount of trauma as a Mastectomy. I am swollen, but not too much. Reconstruction depends on the amount of tissue taken out, They didn't do that for me today, but I'll be interested to see the end results in the next week or so. As of right now, NO lifting! I think the recovery for that has a lot to do with the number of lymph nodes they take out as it would be more invasive. They didn't give me a date for lifting things, but I would imagine you would want to wait a couple of weeks so as not to open up your incision. I was told to be careful stretching and reaching with that arm for the next few days. Feel free to PM me with any questions! I'll give you the honest answers! Hope all is well Fellow Warriors! Have a healing weekend!",

To the newbies, Welcome and if I didn't get your info updated properly, feel free to drop me a PM so that I get the correct info on the schedule. I had my regular appt with my MO yesterday and he confirmed that pre-surgery I had CPR! Amazing what these drugs can do! We discussed the \"lost clip\" episode and I think he'll be more diligent about reading the radiologist's report on that account for his future patients. (Gotta love making the professionals more aware of important things). Rosebowl16, DsMom, and DCISinAZ - I hope that you are relaxing and pampering yourselves in preparation for your surgery day!",

I am sorry that you have had to go through all of this at such a young age, but glad to hear that you were pro-active! Also happy that you have made your way through the majority of your treatment! Surgery can be very scary, but there are so many ladies that can support you through it and answer your questions (from a patient's point of view). DCIS inAZ- I am so so sorry to hear about your puppy! Our's is getting up there in age and I worry that my boys will get up one morning and find him passed away. Shelleybeans - I hope that you are able to get your surgery date! I felt like the wait was so long to see my BS (it was over the holiday) and then the PS (as I was hoping for a BMX). Luckily I had scheduled my lumpectomy, just in case and only had 2 days in between the last appt where the decision was made and the surgery. If the Drs see anything unusual in any of your tests or scans, they will have you do another scan...I had a spot on my liver that led to a CT and a follow up CT in another month. They don't believe it to be anything, but I am glad they follow up as I would rather catch anything suspicious right away. Elem - I know exactly what you mean about where your thoughts go when you are around other people and how your life has changed with your diagnosis. I think that one of the main things is that people assume that after chemo & surgery, you have nothing else to do with the cancer...you are just cured and should get on with your life. In reality, I have an oncologist that I will see every year for the next decade, mammograms every 6mo-yr and the freaking out of the waiting period after each and every one, and will get scared to death with worry with each new pain or period of not feeling well. 3Bears - I hope that you had a FANTASTIC birthday! I got my dx 2 weeks before my birthday and didn't really celebrate it, but I sure plan on celebrating this year as I will be done with almost everything (I will have one more Herceptin and then port removal just after). Annoyingboob- For me the Drs said chemo first (I am triple positive), then surgery & radiation (if MX, no radiation needed) and sometime during radiation,I would start tamoxifen. I just got my referral for the RO and will call this week to make an appt but most likely not start until 4 weeks post-surgery. One of my bc friends had nipple/skin sparring BMX with immediate reconstruction and she was thrilled with the outcome. Now I have to go pick up some ice cream! ",

There was one point that I would have lived if they had lived if they had sucked out some of the fluid. I had obvious pockets of liquid, now it feels harder, different. I'm not sure they could do it now. I tried to make an appt with the RO today... they will call me back. Have you decided which type of radiation you are going to do? I'm not sure if I'll have an option, but I've started reading up on brachytherapy just in case... gotta be fully informed! Btw, my swollen boob is the right, so we would have a matched set! 😊",

Just don't overdo anything by reaching or lifting too much on the surgery side. I only had one incision (MO says that's why I have more swelling - more digging around from one starting point), but got really purple and blue the 2nd day as the fluid built up and stayed pretty colorful for about 6 days. Peed blue for about a week. Don't fret if the results aren't in right away... I got mine at a post-op appt 6 days after. I am still pretty swollen, so don't worry to much if you are too. My BS says I can try compression to reduce the swelling, but trying to wrap up your boobs are not the easiest thing. Quick healing and good news!",

Sorry that you weren't able to be there, but from the sound of it, it would have been harder on you than your daughter! Seeing your children in pain, even for such a glorious outcome is soo hard! What a treasure though! Certainly makes all of this worth it! I hope that you get to visit them both very soon. Pyrrh - so glad that the chemo train passed you by! Not happy about the info you got from the class on Tamoxifen! I wouldn't even let the MO tell me about them yet since I'm not starting until after rads. Cowboy-up: Happy Birthday!!! I hope that you get to celebrate either today or even all weekend long! The rads (for me) is just a few minutes of sitting on the table in a not completely comfortable position and counting howe many times the machine moves around. I try to just close my eyes and rest and there really isn't much else that you can do. I did get the tattoos (2 itty bitty dots) yesterday. I was reluctant as they are on my front, not my back and I didn't want a reminder... They are definitely not something you would ever notice unless you were really looking for them! Pugsmama - Oh no, no leaks! They need some type of stuff you can put in there like you use on a flat tire that blocks the hole! Be mentally prepared for the change in weight of the new TE's! I'm sure it'll be quite a change! Isn't it funny, as much as we hate the constant Dr.'s appt and cancer-related things, they are also the strangest form of security blanket! I've also noticed that the appts seem to come in spurts; some time away, then a bunch all at once.  Have a beautiful day Ladies! After today I will be 1/9th the way done with rads! (4 out of 36- can you tell I am a total numbers geek??)  ",

We just got back from a much needed family vacation and love to see so many people in a better place on their journey than when we all started here 8 months ago! I have 2 more infusions of Herceptin, then my mammogram, and finally port removal! I can't wait! (I consider the port removal as my actual graduation). I have been on Tamoxifen for 2 months and the only noticeable the side effect is hot flashes... which my MO prescribed Effexor and since then, it's been smooth sailing. Vargadoll- So happy to hear you got the all clear!!!! That's what we all want to hear! I hope everyone will continue to let us know as you have them and we'll be here for you if you have to wait for the results! Cowboy-up I am so sorry to hear about your SIL! We really don't want any new members in this club. I'm sure that you will be a much needed support system for her and she can always post here and gain a new group of sisters that have her back! Best of luck to all of you ladies going through exchanges, nips, tucks, grafts, etc. Remember if you need us, we are here... it just may take a little longer to respond! Maybe we should set up a contact list... Christmas cards, little notes, etc? Let me know your thoughts...  Love to you all!",

I am still fighting the chemo flu portion of my last chemo :-( I have updated the list and tried to clean it up a bit so that those with the same surgery date are a bit easier to identify. If I missed anyone or put any incorrect info,feel free to PM me! I do have a question for you... I told my Dr my decision for surgery (BMX) and he is really fighting me (nicely-but still - he wants breast conservation). He did submit a referral for a PS and I am (hopefully) going to be fit it to see her soon to discuss what the possible reconstruction options are, but how many of you (if any) had your surgeon try to convince you to do something other than what you decided? I really like my surgeon otherwise and I think between me and the PS, once I schedule, it's a done deal I just really wish he had said \"well, if that's what you've decided\", you know?",

The first week after my lumpectomy everything was fine, but then I just started swelling everyday and I developed a firm area (felt like I got my own breast implant - but on the side) and I finally went in today. They withdrew 200 CC's of fluid, but I feel so much better! They said they may need to drain it again in a week or so if it continues to swell. The main reason they drained it was the amount of fluid and it was putting pressure on my incision (and my boob was HUGE - at least 2x normal). I hope that your's starts to go away ASAP. Congrats to all on the continued good news! Pyrrh - I am so happy that your Oncotype was so low! I am thankful for anyone that can avoid chemo! Dafne- I am a summer girl too, but I am embracing the winter weather as it works better for my hat-wearing self and it gives me a reason not to go out as much.",
