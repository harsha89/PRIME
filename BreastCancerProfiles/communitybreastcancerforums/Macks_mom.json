I'm going through the dx Process right now. September of last year I found a small lump in my right breast towards my armpit though not in my arm pit. I went to see a breast surgeon. She sent me for an MRI. It should inflamed beast tissue of an unknown type. My breast tissue is very dense and made it difficult to see what the lump was. Surgeon told me to come back in a few months to check it again. Since then the lump went away, but just a week or two before the follow-up visit it returned. It has since grown to approximately 3 cm. To make matters worse, 4 days before the follow-up i found a large swollen lymph node in my groin. Surgeon sent me for a u/s to confirm. U/s confirmed 4.8 cm lymph gland enlargement. It concerned the surgeon so much she had already set an appointment with an oncologist before calling me. Saw the oncologist 3 days later. Of course, the lymph node had reduced itself to less than 2 cm when the onc checked it. But it has since grown and become tender and sore again in the few days since the onc visit. And now I think I've found another painful lymph node - this time in the armpit opposite the breast lump - although it's barely palpable. Short of the lump and nodes, I have been absolutely symptom free. I feel good. I eat we'll. I have no other symptoms! A chest X-ray was clear. My blood tests were \"perfect\" per the oncologists. The only family history I have is my maternal grandmother having breast cancer that spread to her lungs. I have a lumpectomy and node removal scheduled for this Tuesday. Scared to death, but it has to be done. Have any of you presented this way? I just want to see who has shared a similar story. K@ Log in to post a reply",

She recommended the biopsy for the breast lump because she felt it was acting strange and felt the excisional biopsy was the best course. Once she got the results of the u/s of the lymphnode back a few days later, she consulted with a hematologist/oncologist she works with a lot. They recommended removing both the lump and the node at the same time to get a definitive answer up front. Beesie, you bring up a good point. The oncologist did take labs to test me for what she called \"evidence of rheumatic process\". So apparently she's thinking something else may be going on as well. The oncologist seemed more concerned about the breast lump than the node. The node or lump in my armpit showed up a few days after the visit with the oncologist. I'm gonna let the surgeon know about it before the surgery. I'm just hoping for the best and trying to prepare for the worst.. Thank you again for your response! K@",
