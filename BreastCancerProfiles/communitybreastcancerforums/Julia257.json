Have a wonderful weekend!  Julia",

My PCP's on-call doc said that she doesn't prescribe antibiotics on the phone and that it could be a viral infection anyway, that it's going around.  She said I have a few days, to take acetaminophen and think positively.  At the pharmacy I picked up ColdEze as recommended by the pharmacist so I'm hoping for the best and will definitely keep you posted.  Thanks again for your kindness.",
