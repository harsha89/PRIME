Luckily I can stay on the trial cause it is working for me and I have few side effects ( neuropathy in my feet) .  just wondering",

Even though there is \"NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE\" -NED, He recommended that I stay on the protocal. oh well!! He said I should complete 2-3 more cycles since the chemo has been  tolerable. I will have another PET CT scan after that and decide again how to proceed at that time. I so badly want to be done with this, but Dr K had a great point. I am in a good place as the treatment has work and we are not sitting here discussing that it did NOT work and trying to determine what the next treatment will be. I am so VERY THANKFUL for what I do have. I have a great PET CT  SCAN results!!!!  I think I can live with that and continue with the chemo!!  LOL!! Live is good and I am so ready to EAT some great food at the Taste of Georgetown this Saturday. I know I am so blessed as I continue to be able to enjoy food and not get sick!!!  The chemo wrecks havock on my stomach, but I never get sick and throw up -- so I have not lost any weight, ~~~DAMN DAMN DAMN ~~~ however I can eat various foods and it settles the stomach. weird -- just freaking weird!!!    My doctor in the office told me that he is one the few doctors that is NOT concerned about me gaining weight while on chemo -- go figure!! Now I will have EXTRA weight to drop!! oh well!! I contunue to be Livin' and Lovin' and Smilin'!! Peace and Blessings!!!",

I have an appt with my oncologist next Friday to determine the next steps!! I think, I hope, I pray that I am done with this mess they call cancer!!!.",
