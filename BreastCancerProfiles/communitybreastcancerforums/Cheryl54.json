I was told my lifetime risk was 85%, and my choices were pbm, removal of ovaries or tamoxifen.  I did not want to do anything that would affect me systemically, and I was told the last two choices would only cut my risk in half.  The pbm offered the greatest risk reduction and had no systemic effects.  I had a great plastic surgeon, and I am thrilled with the cosmetic results.  But the best part is - no more worries!   I can sleep at night, plan for the future, and not worry if I should be spending my days munching on broccoli and flax seeds at every meal.  My final pathology report confirmed my decision -- I was filled with junky, precancerous cells in both breasts, including LCIS.  I believe the pbm saved my life.  I woke up smiling after my surgery and haven't quit smiling.  I don't mean to suggest that my decision is right for all but it was certainly right for me.",

After reading that, I really felt like I'd \"won,\" -- I got \"it\" before \"it\" got me.    So, I'm still smiling, and have no regrets, not a one.  Good luck with your decision making.  The women here are great and everyone is willing to answer questions.  You might want to check out the breast reconstruction forum nearby.   ",
