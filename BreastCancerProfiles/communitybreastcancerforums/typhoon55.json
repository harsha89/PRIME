      "Content": "Jan 20, 2010 06:35PM - edited Jan 20, 2010 06:42PM by typhoon55 Thanks for starting this thread.  I had nerve pain in my right arm for the past 6 year.  It was under control with Neurontin low daily dose.  After the BMX  (9/22/09) but during the TE expansion the pain was BAD!!  I knew it was my nerve pain back.  Neurontin didn't help, Pamelor my antidepressant did not help.  Burning, tingling, numbness down right arm (had 9 lymph nodes removed).  I thought after the exchange to implants the pain would go away.  Not quite.  It has gotten better but still there.  Numbness and tingling dropping things.  I saw neruologist today who said I'm still swollen from the exchange (12/11/09) and is giving me a diuretic to try first.  Neurontin won't be increased due to salt component.  Maybe increase Pamelor but I hate the side effects.  Will try the diuretic and see neurologist in 3 weeks.  Maybe will try acupuncture.  I even have trouble typing. BTW neurologist said NO capsaiscin (sp) cream as it will initially cause more pain before it helps if it helps.  So be careful of that cream!!! Good luck to all of us with this!!! Janet",

Saw PS today who said it could either be enlarged lymph node (since 9 were removed) or scar tissue.  He will do biopsy when nips are being done in 3 weeks if it is still there (has been there for 2 months).  I bet this thing is not helping the arm numbness and tingling. In other words be careful of people who claim they know something and they don't!! Janet",
