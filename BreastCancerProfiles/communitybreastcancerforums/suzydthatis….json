The first biopsy 'wasn't concordant' with the mammogram pictures, which means the mammogram looked worse than the benign biopsy results that I got in my first biopsy. The re-did the core and they found radial scar with a tiny bit of atypical ductal hyperplasia in the middle. So.....I'm now headed for a surgical excision of the area as they don't like to fool around with radial scars or atypical ductal hyperplasia. My hope is that they don't find anything more sinister when they do the excisional removal. Even though radial scar and atypical hyperplasia are benign conditions, they still raise my risk of breast cancer. So.....I don't think this will ever be truly 'over' for me. :-(",

The tomosynthesis scan results were rated Birads 4C, which put me in a bit of a panic. I had no palpable lump. They were seeing an architectural distortion but no solid mass. I had a core biopsy, which found nothing, so they did another core biopsy, which confirmed a radial scar and a very small area of atypical ductal hyperplasia. I'm waiting now for a surgery date to remove the dodgy area and I've been told that 20% of the time they find DCIS in circumstances such as mine. Anyway, I'm relieved that it wasn't full on cancer but I'm still at high risk. So....that's my Birads 4C story.",

I had a repeat biopsy a week after my first biopsy, which the pathologist and radiologist felt wasn't concordant with the mammogram results (which were 4c). The first biopsy said 'no malignancy noted'. I got my 2nd biopsy results on Thursday: 'focal atypical ductal hyperplasia within radial sclerosing lesion'. Nobody has explained this to me and the only info. I can get is off the net, which can be alarming to say the least. My family doc has referred me to a breast surgeon at the local breast health clinic.....I'm still waiting for the surgical consult date. At the end of my pathology report it says: 'surgical excision is recommended to rule out more extensive disease'. It sounds to me like there are some high risk things in your pathology report (as there are in mine) and they like to remove those to be safe.",
