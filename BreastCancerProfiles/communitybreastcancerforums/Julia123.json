Here's a big hug, I know it's from a complete stranger, but just wanted you to know I understand! I am going to try and work through treatments, with some modification, but as noted earlier I have my doubts about the doability of it for the whole period at this early stage! Of your two choices, I vote for go easy on yourself. Now, of all times! A friend told me that today too.  And hello and welcome to this unfortunate club Saralmom and caltax_catl....the weirdest thing happened to me with my first treatment, I was starving, and yet, everything I drank and ate during it turns my stomach at the very idea of it now (even tho I had no nausea at all during treatment). I had just ordered a big box of the Tazo Zen green tea too! Now, bleh. I very much hope this is not the same for you guys! I do remember my onc saying I might react like a pregnancy to foods.  One of these days soon when I have more energy I'm going to post my diagnosis/dates/regimen..  ",

I had a bad reaction to Decadron, the steroid, at the first treatment (extreme irritability, off the charts anxiety, almost psychotic mood swings, not sleeping, etc. -- in a similar way to how steroids make some athletes mean - apparently about 30% of patients react this way, he said he had one really large guy who was actually becoming violent, clearly a problem LOL). My reaction wasn't that severe, but it was not at all pleasant and was clearly something unusual as I've had no history whatsoever of anxiety, depression, etc. in my past - and so we went without it these last three. I have not missed it, though I have been ever so slightly more queasy, but not too much so. This last treatment was the first time I've had to go so far as to use the Compazine also.  Also like the two ladies above, I have lost all but about 10% of my hair (virtually all of this happened after the second treatment), but no discernible loss of eyebrows or eyelashes. I think I have read this is more likely to happen during the Taxol phase - but I hope not to lose all of them! Unfortunately, my onc says that due to high risk of stroke and other allergic reactions without it, I have no choice but to take the steroid Decadron again during the Taxol phase so I am not looking forward to these final four. There is apparently a version of Taxol that is specially coated so as not to require the steroid, but it is relatively new so insurance companies will currently only pay for it in metastatic breast cancer patients (not we who are doing adjuvant - preventative - therapy). he did offer other options - a regimen called CMF that, while supposedly better tolerated, lasts SIX MONTHS!!! Absolutely not! Not unless there is no other option, as I would prefer to endure 8 weeks of hell (but be finished) to another six months of purgatory, as it were. :-) Or, I could do Taxotere with less steroid, but it would also extend my treatmen by a few weeks. I opted to try the Taxol with the steroid, along with Wellbutrin and Xanax, and see if we can't get me through it with the steroid. Back to my experience with the blessedly concluded A/C - the first time was the worst, at least in part because of the steroid, but also just the shock of feeling so horrible for so many days. I don't think they've gotten better, but my coping skills have sharpened in dealing, and they've not gotten worse either. Basically though, I feel more or less like crap for about six days, then better and better each day. I am working full time during all this, which makes it hard, since works zaps every bit of energy I do have. I had to take two days off and leave early one day after the first treatment, but only one full day off these last three. I would like to now rant about presumably well meaning individuals in our lives - in my case, one good friend, and one breast cancer volunteer who is not a survivor herself - who keep asking if it's better each time, and when you say no, about the same, seem insistent it should be (or just want you to tell them it is), and then proceed to tell you a story about some 92 year old who's been through four types of cancer, endless rounds of chemo and other treatment, and who is eternally energetic, upbeat and positive, wears clown wigs to make light of losing her hair, and things along those lines. Know what? That's great, but I am not that person. I do not whine, I do mention the positive things when they are there and look for them, but I am not going to tell you I am better, wear clown wigs, or generally put on some show so that YOU can feel better. This sucks and I feel like crap a lot. That's the truth. It does me no good whatsoever for you to continually appear to insinuate that I should be handling it better. Bite me.  Okay, rant over. :-) Good luck and hugs to all of us as we get through the rest of this! I do hear that in many people the Taxol phase is easier than A/C, so I'm hopeful that it will be with me and help balance out the effects of the steroid.",

I am also triple negative though, so that other part about building back up is worrisome! I am definitely going to write this question down and ask my onc next time! I don't get the Neulasta shot anymore either though. There seemed to be a bit of confusion as to whether I should - the first time the head partner (not my usual onc) said it wasn't necessary with Taxol, this last time the nurse practitioner I saw felt I might should still get them. But, my blood counts had come back up fine from the first time, so we went without it.",

I'm the one who had the issues with the steroid on the first A/C - but the good news with Taxol was that, even tho the steroid is required to ward off reactions, at least I didn't have to take it four days straight! I felt some unpleasant effects from it, but managed through it. The worst part of Taxol so far has been rather intense shooting pains in my back/hips, starting with day 3. Anyone else experience this? Even oxycodone wasn't doing more than taking the edge off. It seems to be better today (day 4).  As others have mentioned, was incredibly drowsy after the long, grueling treatment (four + hours total), urgh. Came home and passed out by 6:30 p.m. But, as others have also mentioned, I find that I am just a bit more tired each round as they go on..my body is getting weaker....thank God there are \"only\" three left. This is all so scary sometimes isn't it? Each new symptom, drug and side effect, and then also, seeing others around you who are having worse problems at the onc office sometimes. How is everyone else who started Taxol doing? ",

All four were bad, but by far for me it was the first and the last that were the worst. With the last, it was partially the realization that I was recovering more and more slowly with each one, and the fear that I would just be a puddle in the floor by the time this was all over!  But, I just had my second dose dense Taxol (every other week X 4) this past Wednesday, and while I understand that the weekly Taxol regimen is a lower dose and even better as far as side effects, I have to say that while there are some new, different little weird things with Taxol, the truly debilitating weakness/sickness/fatigue is over after a few days (as opposed to veering ever closer to the full two weeks as time went on with A/C). So, yes, it has been easier for me so far. I realized after a yucky few days and about a week after the first one that - wow, I felt genuinely 100%. And, I would never have had the concentration and energy to be typing on here three days after any of the A/C treatments like now. :-) Mama33 - I also have the flu like aches and shooting pains down the side of my back with Taxol. It's a common side effect of it, whether you're still getting the Neulasta or Neupogen shots or not (I no longer am with Taxol). I agree with Emme, get strong pain meds from your onc. I have oxycodone that I take on those days. We should not have to suffer any more than is absolutely necessary! Say, has anyone asked their onc yet why some of us are on weekly Taxol X12 vs. every other week X 4? My chemofogged brain totally forgot to ask this question last Wednesday!  Also, anyone else losing their eyebrows and eyelashes? I noticed yesterday I was losing eyebrows - not eyelashes yet, knock on wood. And, anyone else having regular hot flashes/night sweats now? LOL I am 44 and wasn't yet menopausal, but I guess the menopause they predicted is fully in progress.",

LOL I thought A/C was going to kill me, and while Taxol has it's funky little side effects and more muscle/joint aches and pains, I LOVE that overall sickness/weakness/fatigue which was the worst part of A/C for me is far less and far shorter. They do say most people have an easier time with Taxol, so hopefully that will be you too! raerae - I hate Benedryl! Like saralmom, my reaction to it has been those crazy restless legs during what is now a marathon length treatment with Taxol, along with what I find to be an unpleasant drowsiness as compared to the very pleasant one with Ativan. I highly recommend the Ativan. I've been having it during treatments since my second A/C when I was crying from nerves before it began (my first A/C was horrible and I was fearful, so they drugged me so they wouldn't feel as bad..haha!). I didn't even know what it was before that, but now I ask for it every time, awesome stuff, so if it will help with the racing heart, absolutely do it! My radiation consult is scheduled for 7-8, ugh. Has anyone had theirs yet? I'm primarily wondering how quickly I can finish my surgery - switching out tissue expanders for implants - after it is over (I've heard everything from 3-4 weeks to 2 months). At this rate, 2010 is basically going to be a lost year! So ready for this all to be over with so I can make lots of travel plans! I've been up here mostly alone all through this, and think that once I can get to travel and see family that can't travel due to age, etc., I'll just burst into tears from relief at even the perception that I can take a few days/weeks to not have to feel I'm the one who has to take care of everything!",

I can understand why some women just take their chances with the cancer returning. :-( I also wonder if the steroids are really necessary or perhaps cause worse problems in some women rather than help?

I could stuff it, I know, but it just seems like too much trouble. Also, went for my rads consult recently and they highly recommend you wear very comfortable bras, particularly those like the soft shelf bras, so glad I already have some! Shygal: I am so sorry you have to have another biopsy! *big hug* Please let us know how it goes! I was originally diagnosed with Stage 0 DCIS, but I have a strong family history, and literally my very first thought was \"I want them GONE\". The deal I made with my surgeon was that if my BRCA gene test came back positive (and I was just sure it would), I'd have bilateral, otherwise I'd do lumpectomy. Well, lo and behold, it came back negative - but the gene counselor told me that they believe they've only identified 2/3rds of the heredity links, and that she thought a bilateral was still a good idea.   Now that I've had my surgery, and turned out to actually be Stage 3a with 8 positive lymph nodes, I'm EXTREMELY glad I got rid of both those puppies! My oncologist has also said it's a much better option if a woman is okay with the idea of it and all, simply because you no longer have to go through the mammogram process - and he says after you've had cancer, they watch every tiny speck of anything and send you for more mammos/biopsies/etc. at the drop of a hat, so you save yourself all that stress, at least. They'll test us every 3 mos and/or every 6 months in other ways, of course, but at least it's one less type/round of testing to go through.  Also, a friend of mine had to have two lumpectomies, and it ended up slightly deforming her affected breast. So, another thought for me was simply that I could have a better chance of even boobs! On the other hand, I now have to have one more surgery to switch out TE's for implants, which with a lumpectomy you might be done with surgeries. Good luck in whatever you decide, and remembering you in my prayers as you await biopsy results (no offense if you aren't a believer!).",

As others have alluded to, nothing makes you understand this experience like going through it - while I don't think I'd have been one of those who pushed someone to feel differently than they did, I also don't think I'd have really understood this in a dear friend either. After this though, I will! A part of my reactions now too are about me always being \"the strong one\", and having to unlearn some of that. I've had to learn to ask for help, and realize that it's ultimately me who has let my loved ones believe and expect me to be invincible in the past, so I'm probably a smidge more impatient with responses that still want to force me into that role right now that I should be.  And unfortunately, no, I'm told there are no other steroid options that won't be essentially the same issue, but thank you for your good wishes! Maybe knowing what is causing it will help some too, as the first time I had no idea and so I thought I was losing my mind...LOL  Caltex_Catlady - loved the \"you caught it early!\" stuff!

For me, I was already taking Naproxen (prescription strength Aleve - have been taking it for other issues for awhile), and when I called the first time they said add Tylenol to it. Phfffft.
