I thought it was strange but assumed it was \"just a lymph node\" and was fine and would go away on it's own and I'm so busy with work and kids I rarely thought about it. However, this past week I realized how long I've had it and it made that area slightly uncomfortable and within the past few weeks I also developed a small amount of clear nipple drainage from my left breast as well so I began to Google what causes that and realized I needed to go see my doctor so I did and I was sent the same day to get an ultrasound and they found my axillary lymph node to be just over 3cm (no mammo and only ultrasound was done on the area of my armpit at this point...my Dr is ticked the hospital didn't check my whole breast as requested but we have a horrible hospital here and that's a whole other story), my blood work came back saying I have no infections and my prolactin levels are all within normal range. She is very concerned and is referring me to a surgeon for a biopsy. she actually seemed really worried when my blood work came back normal which makes me more nervous. I guess I just want to know what your thoughts are since I've had it so long, illness and infections have been ruled out and my wbc came back also completely normal.. is it likely to be breast cancer at this point? I'm worried because I ignored it for so long and didn't realize it was something to worry about. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Mar 7, 2013 01:08PM - edited Mar 7, 2013 01:11PM by 29momoftwo I have been so busy I forgot to update. My ultrasound found an oval shaped solid mass 9.3x5.4x4.8 mm with \"slight posterior acoustic enhancement.\" I'm not really sure what that even means. It is wider than it is tall so the radiologist believes that that along with my age it is most likely a fibroadenoma but she wanted it biopsied and she seemed slightly nervous talking to me. A small benign looking cyst was also found but nobody is worried about it so that is good.They also found My lymph node is still enlarged but because it still doesn't have abnormal characteristics other than being big radiology won't biopsy it. Funny since that's what led to all this testing to begin with was that node. My surgeon wanted to do an excisional biopsy and she felt the lymph node should come out in addition to the solid lump but I opted for the core needle biopsy instead which was suggested by the Dr in radiology at the breast center where I had my ultrasound. I feel nervous for two reasons.. did I make the right choice with this biopsy and will it be accurate enough, was I wrong to not go with my surgeon's plan to remove both the solid lump and lymph node and test it all? I go in Monday March 11th bright and early at 8:00 and I'm terrified of the whole procedure. They said afterwards I'll have results in 24-48 hours.",

It would be awful to develop lymphedema if everything turns out normal in terms of the lump they're concerned about. The surgeon said most of the solid lump would be removed with core biopsy anyways so I guess I'm just thinking if that really is diagnosed as something simple like a fibroadenoma it seems like an awful lot to go through and so much more risk involved. But I do have that worry they'll miss something and that is a little scary. I'm just trying to not panic and take it one step at a time because I am just thankful that I seem to have good doctors and they're all on top of this. I am afraid of the biopsy procedure but I'm so ready for it at the same time. I hate being stuck in this limbo of not knowing.",

She felt the enlarged lymph node and finished the rest of the breast exam and stated that I have a thickened area in the breast with the enlarged lymph node and she referred me to a breast center for a complete ultrasound but they were unable to get me in until next Monday. She also insisted I schedule another appointment with her the same day as the complete ultrasound. I am so nervous and honestly even more scared that a surgeon with 40+ years of experience found something else she was concerned about (the thickening in only my left breast)... I had felt it too but once again, I was looking for lumps and not strange thickened areas inside my breast. I hate all the waiting, it's like being stuck in limbo. Whether it is or isn't cancer I just want to know so I can move on with my life. I'm feeling so frustrated and afraid.",

It's been enlarged for like 8 months now I think so it would be nice to know what exactly is causing that. I just can't believe all the hoops you have to jump through and the scans and all the doctors... it should be simpler than this. Something is wrong so just biopsy it all, you know? I have work and two kids and have to drive almost 3 hours every time I need to see a decent surgeon or have an appointment with radiology. I don't trust my local hospital, they were rude, didn't finish the scans they were originally asked for and I know they misdiagnosed my ex-husband's mom years ago so the traveling is worth it to know I'm in better hands.",

It took the doctor a good 5 times of going in with that giant needle but it still didn't hurt much. It was mostly pressure. I should have my results in 24-48 hours now. I'm nervous about the results but I just had to share my biopsy experience with the other ladies here who are awaiting their's.",
