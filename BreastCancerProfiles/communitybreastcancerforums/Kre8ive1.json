I only have nipple pain and a \"full feeling\" in my breast and sometimes the pain goes up into lymph node area under my arm. Doc doesn't feel like I have IBC since I have no other symptoms (redness, swelling) but I feel like what if it's really early and I just don't have those symptoms yet? But I guess it progresses fast and if I did have IBC I would have other symptoms by now. ??? I guess I just need to quit worrying like you. :)",

It has now switched to a constant \"tingling\" and full feeling in that breast. When it was quite painful before I could feel it \"flow\" to my armpit lymph nodes. My doctor doesn't think it's IBC because I don't have the classic swelling and redness. I know it progresses fast so I'm sure I would have other symptoms by now but I'm wondering if anyone else diagnosed with IBC only had the nipple pain. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
