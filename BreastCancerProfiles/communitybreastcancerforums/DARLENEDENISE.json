So, I will ride the Cyberknife again on Tuesday.  I hate this ride.  I would feel much better about all of this knowing some of my cyber metsisters are, praying, chanting, burning incense or whatever they can offer during ANOTHER episode of Fear Factor.  Next week will reveal the results of my Pet scan. I just want pansy news on these, no poop.  Send some good stuff my way, I'm over this scary stuff and am running a little low on courage at the moment...thank you!! Darlene Courage is when you are scared to death but saddle up anyway.

Things are clear as mud on the brain issue right now.  I have a previously Cyberknifed  lesion that developed extensive edema and caused my brain to shift over my left mid-line to a potentially life-threatening event.  I had just returned home from a 4 day road trip to the Biltmore Estate late Wed nite and was starting to notice symptoms.  Saw onc first thing Thursday am and had a stat Brain MRI late that night and told Friday mid-morning to head straight down to UNC ER for immediate intake.  4 hour drive, none the less.  Steroids have worked to resolve most symptoms and reduce the mid-line shift. Hoping they continue the good work.  Can't tell at this time if this is necrosis/Radiosurgery Effect or cancer regrowing in the lesion, so, we cannot make a plan until we know more.  For now, 4 weeks of steroids and then another neurosurgeon visit at UNC with more and different types of scans to try to figure it out.  I wanted to re-sect it, but not amendable to surgery.  Due to my TDM1 clinical trial,I already had a bone scan scheduled Thursday am just before I was able to squeeze in on my onc about the brain symptoms. Also had a CT scheduled for Friday am and got that done in the nick of time to be told hit the road to UNC, ASAP.  Literally out out of the scanner and on the road to UNC, Chappell Hill. Got home late Monday nite, flew to Nashville early Wed am to get news of the bone & CT scans to determine if TDM1 is working and if I will be continued in the trial.  Finally, some good news!!  After three treatments, there is no new progressions and the three liver lesions have all regressed and my ca15 tumor markers are down to 41! A chemo friend  died in the midst of all of this, so, please forgive my time away to try to decompress and regroup.  I knew this post would become a novel and was short on energy and emotionally spent. That's it for now.  I think it's enough!! LOL  I think the damn anxiety may get me before the cancer does. Sending my love and best to every one here.  Couldn't imagine doing any of this without you!! Really!! Let's stay strong...Darlene Courage is when you are scared to death but saddle up anyway.

You might be interested in knowing they fund BC research at St Johns Hospital in AZ and developed the Sentinal Node Biopsy proceedure. After John Wayne's own heroic battle with cancer, his family established the John Wayne Cancer Foundation (JWCF) to advance the fight against the illness. The John Wayne Cancer Foundation's mission is to bring courage, strength and grit to the fight against cancer. What is grit?  John Wayne put it best when he said, \"courage is being scared to death but saddling up anyway.\" Grit is bravery. A fighting spirit. Guts. Determination. It's standing up for what you believe in and taking care of the people you love. Just thought I'd share my quote and my courage.
