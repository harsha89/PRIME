The worst part for me is the area under the breast.  The only part that has not turned almost red is the tumor incision area.  No telling what the boosts will do there. The techs explained that the whole breast rad treatments used photons to penetrate deep into the breast tissue, but the boosts used electrons that mostly hit only the skin.  Thanks for your encouragement.  I hope the time until your last treatment will pass quickly. ",

The procedure takes about 45 minutes.  Expect the RO and techs to make a lot of marks on the breast area with sharpies.  They also tape wire markers onto you to enable the RO to find important spots when he reads the scans to plan your treatments.  At the end, the techs will either do very small tattos or make markings covered by tape.   My experience with mapping was not physically painful, but it was very difficult emotionally.  Try to have it at the end of the day so that you do not have to return to work afterward.  If possible, bring someone with you.  They will probably have to wait in the lobby, but seeing a friendly face at the end helps a lot.  Finally, plan on doing something nice for yourself that night like going out to dinner.  It is definitely a time for self-pampering. I hope you are healing quickly from your re-excision.  Good luck with everything. ",

My BS, MO, and I all thought I should have chemo after the SNB was positive so I did not have the Oncotype test.  I asked about chemo for Grade 1 and my MO said that chemo killed fast growing cells and even Grade 1 cells grew at a faster rate than normal cells.  No one thought of my Grade 1 as \"wussy.\"  The fact that it spread to a lymph node got everyone's attention.  All I can say is that I have absolutely no regrets about choosing chemo.  I also had a lumpectomy and rads and my prognosis is good. If I were to change anything, it would be to have had an MX and forgo rads.  Wishing you all the best, Chase2.",

It put me at greater risk for lymphedema and I do have a mild case of it, but I enjoyed the peace of mind of knowing that additional cancer would be removed from my body if it was present.  I had four rounds of TC to kill any BC cells that might have been lurking anywhere in my body.  Whether chemo for BC kills other cancer cells, I do not know.

In the beginning, usually the only physical side effect is fatigue. Some women have skin issues near the end of rads. Some women have skin that does fine. For me, my skin was red and sore near the end, but that was all. Be sure to ask your RO about what creams he wants you to use and apply them to your breast several times daily. Also, ask him about want deoderant he wants you to use. Since you are starting actual rad treatments tomorrow, you have probably already had the dry run. The treatments are just like that. The actual procedure lasts only a few minutes. Most of us found it took longer to drive to and from the rads facility than it did to have each treatment. You will change into a hospital gown and lie on the the table of the rad machine. The techs will position you exactly where they want you. They will line you up according your tattos so that the same precise area is radiated each day. It is very important to remain still after the techs have positioned you. Then, the techs leave the room and the rads machine starts whirring. If more than one field is being radiated, the machine will move around you. When the treatment is done, the doors to your rad room will open and the techs will help you off the table. The RO will see you once a week. Also, you will have Xrays once a week while lying on the rad table to make sure the proper area is still being radiated. It all sounds simple, but I found rads really affected me emotionally. Perhaps, I was already on edge after surgery and chemo. Just remember that whatever you feel is normal. Take good care of yourself physically and emotionally all during rads. Check this forum for a support group of people having rads at the same time as you. The July and August 2011 forums helped me very much. ",

Today was a good day for the procedure because I learned one year ago today that I would need chemo.  What a year!  I decided to have the port removed in his office with local anesthesia instead of going to an outpatient surgery center.  I needed a lot of novacaine to become numb, but it was painless.  I was able to keep my port for a souvenir.  That gizmo saw me through some bad times. Here is what it looks like.    ",
