Sorry for a young mother who has a great husband who has lived every second of this monster to make sure he understood also.  I love my whole family and when we talk  we say \"when we had cancer\"  since it is a family diesce",

I word of advise is stay comfortable, if it means a whole pill or two take them. I have been on pain meds since my journey began and I do not see anytime soon of coming off.",
