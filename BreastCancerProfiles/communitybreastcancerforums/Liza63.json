(yuch)  Dr. says it will go away.  Will it?  I get more tired with each treatment but am taking lots of vitamins and have cut carbs.  Has anyone's pet scan come back with activity around the scar tissue?  They did a second CT scan to clear up it wasn't cancer and it is still non-conclusive.  I am hoping hte radiation will take care of it.",
