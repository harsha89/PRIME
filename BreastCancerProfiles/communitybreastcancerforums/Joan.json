Nevertheless, the pain does not last long. Infact, the worst pain i have which is also uncomfortable feeling when i touch or check up the lump right under my armpit. I am not saying do not worry, but, definately, must have a check up and pray for the best outcome.  Best of luck to you all. Hopefully, you are be alright. :)",

Then, from that onwards, I had been having my tests down under government hospital. One of the specialists told me that I have lumpy breasts. I guess its means that i have many lumps inside both breasts. However, there is one specific lump which I have been feeling for around six months ago and still have that lump. I will be having an ultrasound soon. Well, in July anyway.  I guess that I have had many sugery before in other parts of my body. To me, surgery is very like part of my life. Sometimes, can be very stressful, as like knowing there is a bomb shell inside the body and could be exploded at any time in life. So, instead of worry about the coming ultra sound, I put myself focus on learning something new. I can't hundred percent said that to others stop worrying. Because, I still could remember the first time i had my surgery done with my breast. I was so worried that i woke up after the surgery and the first question i asked the nurse was that, Did i have BC (breast cancer) and the nurse was showing me the lump that got taken out and said to me it had to be detacted first. I knew that feeling till now, its so much worst than other operations that i had done in the past. I only can say to others dont' let this take away your future. Try to hang in there no matter what the outcome will be to you all.",
