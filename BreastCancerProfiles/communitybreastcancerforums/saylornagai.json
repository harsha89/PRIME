I have big breasts and always have a \"lump\" if you will in my right breast. So going in I told them,they did mammo she comes back and wants more of left breast. My Provider didnt detect it. Then they made me wait for ultrasound and believe me seeing that mass on the screen was upsetting. They told me that they would call in a week. They called within the hour. Its one inch and well I keep seeing there \"looks\" per say. I had my needle biopsy they seemed concerned. Still waiting and any information about experiences would be greatly appreciated.
