      "Content": "Nov 21, 2013 11:17AM lisa137 wrote: My BMX was on October 14th. No reconstruction. ALL the nodes on the left (cancer) side were removed. For those who are starting to get nervous about their upcoming surgeries, here's the stuff that's freshest in my mind that can maybe help. Firstly, I'm only a little over a month past it, but honestly, I'm pretty much over it. Taking a little longer to get range of motion back with the left arm due to the nodes being removed, but all that means is that I can't get things off the VERY top shelf in my kitchen with my left hand. No biggie. So while you're laying there flat on your back wondering if life will ever be good again: It will, and it won't take long. Read a good book (or lots of them,) watch some movies you've been meaning to watch and haven't had time, and make the best of it. It goes by faster than you think. This part of it might be a lot different for those getting reconstruction, but for me, *pain* was never really much of an issue. I stayed ahead of it with my pain meds and didn't worry about it, nor did I try to rush myself off the pain meds. Drinking lots and lots of water, eating lots of good fiber-filled foods, drinking kefir, and taking stool softeners regularly (haha) prevented constipation from being an issue. If you're not having much pain though, alternating the prescription stuff with Ibuprofen DOES help with getting the inflammation and discomfort from that down faster. The upside to not trying to \"tough out\" the painful part is that the pain meds will make you sleep a lot---which is better than thinking about how bored you are lying flat on your back and will make the time go by faster, and will also keep you from getting up and moving around and doing too much, which in turn will help you get those drains out faster. I had 5, count 'em, 5 drains, to deal with. I hated them, but they were truly more a nuisance than anything else. They grossed me out, so my husband dealt with draining and stripping them. He stripped them religiously, EVERY night, and the one and only issue we ever had with the drains was that one night he nicked one of them with the scissors while he was taking off my bandages. Turned out to not be a big deal: Check with YOUR surgeon if this happens to you, but ours told us to just wrap some black electrical tape around the nicked bit, and continue as normal. Worked fine. :) The one tip I wish I'd had ahead of time about the drains was this: The entry points for them would feel irritated---not quite sore, but a little less than itchy, and it just about drove me crazy for the first few days, especially if I moved at all. My husband fixed that problem: Every time he changed my bandages, he'd put a nice dollop of Neosporin there. Kept the skin softer and not so prone to irritation. My surgeon said it was an \"excellent\" idea. Bonus: A little extra guard against infection....and I never did get any infection of any sort. If you have someone who can stay overnight in the hospital with you, LET THEM. As I said, I had 5 drains. Having them pulled out went like this: two did not hurt at all, and the other three did. There was no rhyme or reason or explanation; it didn't seem to have anything to do with the order they were pulled out: The first one did not hurt a bit, just felt weird. The next three did hurt. The last one, which was pulled a full week after the first four, did not hurt a bit. I'm pointing that out because if you have multiples and the first one hurts, it doesn't mean the others will hurt too. They might, and they might not. BUT---of the ones that did hurt, it wasn't the kind of pain that would make you run away screaming and vowing to never do that again lol. Not agony, and it stopped hurting REALLY quickly. If I had to compare it to something, quite honestly, it hurt about like when you get scratched by a cat or dog. Pain yes, but not a big deal. Not nearly as bad as stumping my toe or hitting my head on an open cabinet door, or any of the tons of little ouches we get on a regular basis. Our solution for dealing with the drains on a day to day basis was this: My mother in law made me a belt, with 5 pouches, one for each drain, each of which fastened with velcro, and were affixed to the belt in such a way that they'd slide along it, and could be removed if/when some drains were removed and others were not. It was the *perfect* solution. Cheap and easy to make. Weirdest unexpected side effects: For the first week and a half after surgery I CRAVED sausage and eggs. I hardly ever eat sausage and eggs normally, and I'm over it now, but for that first week I'd wake up thinking of sausage and eggs and just HAD to have them. It was probably actually protein I was craving. :) Only other weird thing was that for the first time EVER, a cup of coffee would actually make me jumpy and \"caffeinated.\" I came to the conclusion that my boobs had been my caffeine processors lol. I don't know what that was REALLY all about, but it passed within a couple of days. My only ongoing issue at this point is that I still can't shave under my left arm: I can't really see it, and I can't really feel it, so shaving it seems like it wouldn't be a very bright thing to do. I considered having my husband go after it with the clippers he uses on his beard and then realized that it will probably fall out with the chemo in a couple of weeks anyway, so....meh. :) All in all, while it certainly wasn't a FUN experience, it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, especially the pain part. The worst of it, for me, honestly, was the boredom, the anxiety I developed about my actual diagnosis, and the fact that no matter how often I showered, I couldn't stay ahead of armpit odor lol.",

Life is good, and I feel great. :) For most, if not all, of you, you'll get through this without major issues. It's not fun, but it's not as bad as you probably expect, either. You've most likely at some point been sick with the flu and felt worse than chemo will be, it's just that chemo lasts longer. And for most, there will be days when you feel remarkably normal.  If I had to do it again, starting tomorrow, today I would go to the store and stock up on the following: Tissues (Nose hairs fell out, nose ran a lot. Later, on taxotere, I had \"taxo-tears\". Went through LOTS of tissues. Children's Benadryl (I kept it by my bed, and when I wanted to sleep but couldn't, and didn't want to pop another Ativan, a couple of small swallows of benadryl did the trick. Plus it's kind of tasty.  Sparkling water or seltzer water. When nothing tastes like it's supposed to, and yet you need to stay EXTREMELY well hydrated, sparkling water basically just tastes like water. With bubbles. And really, STAY HYDRATED. It really will keep your side effects from being as bad. For those in the hemisphere that will be experiencing winter along with chemo, soft hats in several weights. On the one hand, you'll tend to get cold because of the no hair thing, on the other hand, you'll tend to get hot because chemo and/or \"chemopause\" may give you hot flashes, so you'll want at least one very light one, one medium weight one, and one super-warm toboggan. Put them on or by your bed so you can easily switch them out and take them on and off in the middle of the night without having to get up. Some very wet and quick and easy to prepare foods. Chemo can give you issues with dry mouth, and for me, it made it a real chore to eat something like a sandwich. I pretty much lived on chicken pot pies and macaroni and cheese (which my oncologist said sounded to him like \"good solid food\" lol.) Soups are also good. If you're into cooking big batches of stuff and freezing individual servings of it, now's the time to do that. Choose or make a variety though, because what you LOVE today might taste like ditch water during chemo.  Your onc will most likely prescribe you several things for nausea (TAKE them. Don't wait until you are nauseous. I always took all three of mine on the way HOME from chemo, stayed \"on schedule\" with them for a day or so, and then tapered off as I became more sure my tummy would be okay. I never threw up until AFTER chemo was over lol,) From your local store, add some regular heartburn/indigestion remedies. For me, the magic trifecta was Zantac, Tums, and Maalox. My oncologist said the Maalox was a great choice because it has some laxative type properties, as well. Which brings me to: Colace or Miralax. Don't just jump in with taking those; some people have diarrhea instead of constipation, but keep an eye on the situation as it were, and do NOT let yourself become constipated. Take it from one who DID let that happen. Not pleasant. Something to do when you're wide awake at 3 in the morning, whether it's books to read, a tv near the bed, a tablet, crossword puzzle books, or a computer -- I had all of these, plus a friend on another continent who was awake to chat with me on facebook, lol. If you can, sleep when you're sleepy and be awake when you're not, and don't worry about it. For those who can't let their schedule go haywire like that, I refer you back to the children's Benadryl. :P Very comfy clothes to wear to chemo. I saw some people at chemo who were sort of dressed up, but I wore sweat pants, a tee shirt, and a hoodie every time. You're gonna be sitting in that recliner for a couple of hours at least each time, might as well be comfortable. Bonus: if you're really sleepy when you get home (and you probably will be if you take the anti-nausea meds like I did) you can walk straight in the door and fall into bed when you get home.  Claritin, if you're getting Neulasta shots. Start taking it the day before chemo, and keep taking it for a few days after the Neulasta shot. In my case, I realized that the Claritin also helped with the runny nose and eyes (of course,) so I just took the stuff all the time. Something for pain in case the Claritin doesn't do its job well enough, or if you're getting Taxotere (or I assume, taxol.) SOME people do get pain from taxotere. I did. If your ibuprofen or whatever isn't doing the job, call your onc. Don't suffer; it's not necessary. I asked my oncologist to prescribe me hydrocodone at the lowest possible dose, and he did, and that took care of the pain completely. (Likewise, if your anti-nausea meds aren't doing their job, let your onc know. They probably have something to offer you that will work better.) A \"chemo bag.\" I used a canvas bag with handles, and packed it with a book, my own fuzzy blanket (though they did provide blankets for those who didn't bring their own,) my tablet, my ipod and headphones.... and I actually think that's all. You may want to also pack it with snacks and/or drinks, but I didn't need to do that because drinks were provided to us, there was a snack machine, and my husband went out and got us lunch each time. (Bonus: He'd also bring me a milkshake to drink during the adriamycin push, so I didn't need to chew ice.) Baking soda and salt. After my first round of chemo I had HORRIBLE mouth sores. After that, I'd mix up a solution of baking soda, salt, and water in a 1 liter bottle, and keep it, along with a small cup, in the bathroom where my regular mouthwash used to sit. I rinsed with it EVERY time I went into the bathroom for ANY reason, and never had another mouth sore. Biotene mouthwash. Really does help with the dry mouth thing if it's making it hard for you to fall asleep. I also bought the biotene toothpaste, but didn't like it, and wound up just using pure baking soda to brush my teeth. And I still do. Teeth feel cleaner than they EVER did before. A thermometer. Keep a close eye on your temperature, and follow your oncologists' instructions about when to call if you have a fever. If you have to call at 2 in the morning, do it, and don't feel bad about it. That's why they have someone on-call, and that's what they get paid for. That's all I can think of at the moment.  It's probably useless to say this now, but don't be scared of it. It's not THAT bad, generally. And it will go by much faster than you think it will. You will make friends on this thread that will become lifelong buddies, so that's a big bonus.  Good luck, hang in there, lean on one another (because you all \"get it\",) and don't hesitate to PM me, or almost any lady on these boards with any concerns or questions you might have. Then, a year from now, do what YOU can do to help someone else! You can do this. :)",

Ironic that I posted about feeling so good that day, having 4 out of 5 drains out, and napping on my side, because that same night, I suddenly developed a fever of 101.5. Felt like over-baked crap. Sent to the hospital the next day by my surgeon for blood test, urine test, and chest x-ray. The fun part of this---even though thru the entire experience I was in danger of either barfing or fainting on the hospital floor--was when I went to be x-rayed. First the little x-ray tech--she looked to be about 14 years old haha---asked me if I was wearing a bra. I looked down at my perfectly flat no-reconstruction chest, looked meaningfully at the piece of paper she was holding that had BMX written on it in great big letters and told her \"I don't have anything to put INTO a bra....\" Moments later, she has me at the x-ray machine and asks me to reach wayyyy above my head and grasp the bar with both hands. I said \"You have GOT to be kidding me.\" I demonstrated exactly how high I could NOT raise my arms. A few moments after that, she's back at her little panel with another tech and I hear snippets of confused conversation....finally the same girl asks me 'Ummm...do you have a surgical drain?\" LOL What did they THINK they were seeing on that x-ray? I should have said \"nope\" just to scare them. What an experience! In any case, the x-ray was clear, the blood test was clear, and the urine sample \"didn't show enough cultures\" to give any answers, so basically no one knows why I ran a fever off and on for 3 days, felt like absolute crap, and wound up with anxiety attacks due to the entire ordeal. Just when I'd been doing so well, too! Whatever it was, it cleared up a few days later, I got a script for Klonopin, finally go the fifth and final drain out, got half my staples out, and have improved by leaps and bounds over the past week. Chemo may or may not start on Monday, depending on who wins the \"is she healed enough for a port and chemo\" battle between my surgeon and oncologist, and I'm feeling reasonably good most of the time.

Claritin for the Neulasta pain does work for most people, apparently. Start taking it a couple of days before, and for a few days after. Personally, I just went ahead and took it all the time, partly so I wouldn't forget, and partly because it helped with the runny nose I had from having no nose hairs. Claritin did NOTHING for my pain from taxotere, however. My first round of taxotere gave me pain that hydrocodone took care of. The second round of taxotere required that I double the dose of hydrocodone from 5mg to 10mg. For the third and fourth round of taxotere, hydrocodone didn't so much as touch the pain, so I graduated to percocet, which took care of it. However, some of the other ladies in my group never had any pain from taxotere at all. If you're like me though, make sure they understand that it doesn't hurt just a \"little,\" it hurts a LOT.

During the first couple of years that my husband and I were living together--but before we actually got married--I gained some weight, 15 or 20 pounds maybe, and an older lady who is sort of an acquaintance of ours saw me for the first time in quite a while and asked me \"When is your baby due?\" I wasn't pregnant (and I was 45 years old!,) and said so, and she kind of stammered a bit and then said \"Oh...I heard you were.\" Bahahaha. I felt bad for her, and I wasn't offended at all, but I DID laugh about that off and on for hours afterwards. You know, even though we've seen her here and there, I don't believe she has ever spoken directly to me since then. I love people. :) I even sort of enjoy the people who, now that I have (had?) cancer, mean well but don't really know what to say, so manage to say the wrong thing--I guess because I was exactly where they are, just a few months ago. One of my friends said \"It sounds like you caught it early, so that's good!\" Errr....my tumor was 5.5 cm., I'm IIIc, had spectacular node involvement, and my onc says it was probably there for years...lol. I didn't try to explain this to my friend: It would only make her feel bad, and you know, assuming my upcoming bone scan doesn't give me any unwanted surprises (pray pray pray,) we caught it early *enough*, right?

      "Content": "Nov 21, 2013 05:56PM - edited Nov 21, 2013 05:58PM by lisa137 Hi jab :) In my case, it was a perfect storm of bad luck, and a lack of education/awareness/vigilance in my health care providers, and in myself. I had \"extremely dense\" breasts, and my cancer type is the difficult-to-detect lobular. I had regular mammograms for the past few years, and always got the congratulatory post card saying everything was fine. I developed a \"thickened\" area --- saw it in the shower, a sort of bulge to the left -- -back in January, but neither mammo nor ultrasound showed much, if anything, so they put me on the \"come back in 6 months list.\" I could feel it. It was very obviously THERE - the mammo tech felt it and said \"It feels like a little tennis ball in there, doesn't it?!\" She also noted that it had made my left breast seem smaller than my right one. But.... nope, nothing suspicious here. Come back in 6 months! It finally did show up on MRI. Very clearly. 6 months later. So yeah. I made it to stage III because no one *told me* what having extremely dense breasts actually MEANT, in terms of making cancer more difficult to detect, nor in terms of how that factor raised my risk of breast cancer in and of itself. I am.... a little bitter, and a little angry, to be honest. Getting my BMX and IIIc diagnosis in pink-all-over-the-place October made it that much worse. I feel like the system let me down by leading me to believe that having the mammogram regularly was all I needed to do. It let me down by not saying \"Hey! You should maybe get an MRI every now and again to be sure.\" It let me down by not making sure that the mammogram and ultrasound techs were better informed and educated about lobular breast cancer, because once I KNEW what I had, and looked up the signs, it was pretty obvious. Honestly, had I known as much about ILC as I did IDC I could have diagnosed it myself. But...thank God I did decide to visit a different doctor for that 6 month \"follow-up\", and thank God that he sent me immediately---and by immediately I mean the very next day--to a surgeon who DID know a thing or two about ILC. Thank God that so far all my scans and bloodwork seem to indicate that it hasn't spread. But yeah, still bitter and still angry. I desperately want there to be more awareness about dense breasts and what women can do to make sure their cancer isn't missed like mine was. I desperately want there to be more awareness about ILC and how it can, and does, present in an entirely different way from IDC. Realistically I know that the whole pinktober thing really has saved a lot of lives, and enabled a lot of breast cancers to be found earlier than they would have otherwise. But it's not enough. It won't be enough until what happened to me is something that never happens to another woman. I did tell my oncologist last week about that whole experience, and said \"I WISH I had gone to a different doctor in the first place, when I first found it in January,\" and he said \"Don't go there. This has been in your breast, and your nodes, for much, much longer than that. The diagnosis would have been the same.\" Strangely, that did make me feel better---I had made the best choices I could have made, armed with the information that I had. It just wasn't enough information. So there's one answer for you. I won't be surprised if there are other, similar, answers, but I will be sad about them.",

After that I was so relieved that I kept falling asleep on my gurney every time they'd park me someplace. (The ativan I'd taken that morning probably contributed to that, lol.) Some sort of study really needs to be done to figure out who it's going to be painful for, and why, so that women can stop being terrified ahead of time and instead be recognized as someone who will likely feel a lot of pain, and steps take to mitigate or remove that pain. Both the pain that some feel, and the terror that others feel, need to end.",

It was extremely obvious in his case that although he's a general surgeon, he certainly knew what he was doing with breast cancer and breast surgery. I suspect that he'd be a breast surgeon if he was working in a city large enough to support that specialization, but here he just probably has to wear a few extra hats.
