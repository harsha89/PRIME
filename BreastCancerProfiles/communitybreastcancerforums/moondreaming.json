    "Content": "moondreaming wrote: I am new and wanted to share what is happening as I am VERY concerned. For the last 6 months or so I have had widespread pain/symptoms that I did not attribute to my breasts at all. In fact, my concerns were more for that of other gyn cancer or endometriosis. My grandmother passed away from ovarian cancer and my mother had cervical so it has always been a fear of mine. In 2013 I had a TVH, and left only one ovary behind b/c of endometriosis and adenomyosis. Even though I had that surgery I have had increasing pelvic, vaginal, abdominal, bowel, bladder and thoracic pain. I had a pelvic U/S which only showed a simple cyst on my remaining ovary, and later a pelvic MRI which showed a lesion on my vaginal cuff (that could *possibly* be endometriosis). So I began to suspect the endometriosis was spreading and I have an upcoming appoinment with a specialist to see if that is what is going on. While I've been waiting for this appointment my thoracic symptoms have gotten worse. I feel pressure and heaviness in my chest and get pinching, stinging pains in my armpits or in my breasts. My upper back is sore and I sometimes feel pressure and swelling in my neck (thyroid tests were normal. My breasts have been very itchy lately and sometimes feel like they are leaking although there has never been any discharge when I check. The area that is itchy has developed a few bumps that look like bug bites, although I haven't been bitten and have not changed products or soaps. There is also a mole there that has seemed irritated as well, like it is \"flaring up.\" I have also had some unexplained bruising on my breasts with no injuies or explanation. I have never been able to perform self breast exams because my breasts are very lumpy. I had a baseline mammogram when I was young and they even told me then that my breasts were very dense and difficult to visualize. Years ago I also had an ultrasound guided cone biopsy that turned out to be B9. A fibroadenoma, they said. A few days ago I found a lump by chance when I was in the shower. I saw my doc the next day and she felt it and said it felt firm, round and approx 4mm. this area is high up on my right breast @ 2:00. There was another area on the inner aspect (4 or 5:00?) that was tender and felt like a cluster of squishy? lumps. My doc ordered an ultrasound and I went for that but they couldn't see the lump the doc and I felt. The radiologist recommended a diagnostic mammogram and told me that U/S could sometimes show if there was a cyst, but wasn't always great at finding everything. I went for the mammo and they ended up taking some extra \"spot\" pictures of this area of concern, but when the radiologist came out she said everything looked \"fine\" and to just follow up with my doc and \"watch it.\" I'm guessing there must be something showing there if they took extra spot pics and if nothing showed up there wouldn't be anything to \"watch.\" I proceeded to tell her that I am concerned about all my symptoms and that I'd feel more comfortable with a breast MRI, just in case. I also recently just found out family HX I didn't know I had. My grandmother's sister had a double masectomy and her other sister had a son who had breast cancer. She scoffed at my symptoms and told me I had nothing to worry about that they didn't \"match cancer\", but that's not what I've been reading from people on here. Some don't even have symptoms. It seems there is no \"one size fits all\" scenario. Can anyone relate to my story? Am I overthinking? Should I push for MRI or biopsy? My insurance doesn't cover BRCA testing unless I personally have a diagnosis, but given this newfound family history, should I pay out of pocket? I have an appointment with my PCP tomorrow, but after what the radiologist said to me I don't know if she'll take me seriously or order any additional tests. Log in to post a reply",
