In 2002, my first mammogram came back abnormal, and I had to have a large-core stereotactic biopsy, which was quite an experience. But the results were benign. Last January this year, I found a lump, and had a biopsy on two different areas. Both were benign, and I was told they were cysts. In August during my follow-up, the radiologist who looked at the newest ultrasound said that one of the areas no longer looked like a cyst and that he was afraid that the doctor who biopsied it hadn't gotten enough tissue in the sample and that the result was a false negative. (Which meant that he thought it was cancer.) Another, more thorough biopsy of the area though was again negative, thank goodness! I go again for a five-month follow-up on Dec. 30, and though I can still feel the lump there, I know now that there's nothing to worry about.  Hang in there, and try not to worry. :) Hugs, Lisa ",

I've never had an adverse reaction or problem with the contrast at all, and most people don't, since it is cleared pretty quickly from the body by the kidneys. So, as long as your kidney function is good, there's very little to worry about. And in the case of possible breast cancer, I think the benefit of having an MRI far outweighs any potential risk if it can locate something that might be missed otherwise.   Good luck and hugs, Lisa ",

For example, an ultrasound can tell if a suspicious area is a cyst because it is darker on the ultrasound image and doesn't have any solid components in it. Or if it's a complex cyst, it might have solid components which show up on the ultrasound, but which might not be seen on the MRI. Does that make sense?",

The doctor who did the biopsy said that it doesn't look like a cyst now, so she did a core-biopsy on it and took several samples. The area measures 8 x 7 x 5 mm, and from what I saw on the ultrasound, it wasn't even and smooth like a cyst.  The doctor does feel that the results will probably be negative. She also feels that my breast tissue seems to be prone to these types of anomalies and that I'll probably have more as time goes on, but that they will be benign.   Do complex cysts turn into cancer ever? Why did it look like a cyst before and not now? I know it's probably okay, but I'll probably still be worried until I get my results in a few days. (Human nature!)  Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jul 30, 2010 06:22PM - edited Jul 30, 2010 06:36PM by Shashi11962 I had my ultrasound this afternoon, and it didn't turn out quite as I expected. I evidentially was not being seen again because of mico-calcifications, but as a 6-month follow-up on my biopsy. (The lady that called to schedule the ultrasound must have misunderstood the report.) As the tech did the ultrasound, she started asking me what the results were that I got from the biopsy, and I told her it was negative. She asked me if I'd had a reduction, and if they had said if the lesion was fibrocystic changes or fat necrosis. (They hadn't mentioned either.) Then she went to show the ultrasound to the doctor. She finally came back after about 15 minutes, and the doctor was with her. He said that he was concerned that when the biopsy was done in January that the doctor might not have actually gotten the needle all the way into the lesion in question so that the cells that were biopsied weren't from the right area, and that we might have gotten a false negative result.(He said this several times.) He said the area still looks suspicious, and that he he doesn't want to tell me that everything is normal and to come back in a year, and then find out a year later that it's cancer and it's too late. He's going to have the doctor who did the biopsy look at my ultrasound on Monday and see what she thinks. He said they'll call me on Monday and let me know if it's okay or if I need to have another biopsy. He seemed really concerned that the biopsy results might not be right, and that makes me very nervous!  And of course, I have to wait the whole weekend to find out anything!  Again, thanks for your prayers. I really need them right now! ",

      "Content": "Shashi11962 wrote: Hi everyone. I'm new here and facing yet another round of ultrasounds and possible biopsies.  My story starts when my very first mammogram in 2002 at the age of 39 came back with a suspicious area. I had to have an ultrasound, and was so scared, that I was hyperventilating and almost fell off the exam table. The ultrasound tech had to tell me to calm down. I then went for a stereotactic large-core biopsy that was an adventure in itself. During this entire time, I was terrified that I had breast cancer, and the relief when I found out that everything was negative was overwhelming. Fast forward to this past January. I found a lump in my right breast during my self-exam and told my doctor. She thought it was a just a cyst, but went ahead and did a mammogram on that side, then sent me that same day across the street to a women's breast health center for an ultrasound. A few days later, I had two large-core needle biopsies of two separate suspicious areas; both were negative. I was in the process of separating from my husband and moving out of my home, and wasn't even worried about cancer. I was just more aggravated than anything that I had to deal with this on top of everything else, especially when I had so much to do with my move. However, even after those last procedures, I still feel that lump, and when I had my annual exam with my gyn, he said that area felt thickened. But he thought it was probably from either fibrocystic disease or scar tissue from the breast reduction I had in 2005. So, I went this past week for a six-month follow-up mammogram on my right side (and my annual mammogram for my left breast). I got a call Thursday that I have probably benign microcalcifications in my right breast and that the radiologist wants me to have an ultrasound now. (They noted those same calcifications on my mammogram last year, but didn't do anything about them then.) I'm scheduled for the ultrasound this coming Friday (July 30.)  I'm not really worried, definitely not like I was that very first time back in 2002, but I'm just wondering if the areas they are seeing on the mammogram could be caused by scar tissue from my breast reduction, like my gyn said. If they are, wouldn't they have shown up before now, being as that surgery was five years ago?  Oh, and also, I've noticed some swelling of my breast on the side under my arm where those areas are. Is that bad? By the way, I don't have a history of breast cancer in my family, though I personally had early stage cervical cancer in 2007. I am, however, on HRT and have been since Dec. of 2008 when I had my ovaries removed after my hysterectomy.   Log in to post a reply",
