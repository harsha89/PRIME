    "Content": "DaughterOfStageIV wrote: My mom just finished 8 cycles of taxotere and cytoxan. In August she went on a 5 hour flight and since then her feet have been swelling every day. She has never had a problem with swelling before. Her doctor first checked for blood clots. The ultrasound was normal. She was just sent for an echo. We are waiting for the results. She said it is getting worse and it's becoming uncomfortable. She had an echo last year and it was normal so I can't imagine there would be a problem now but you never know. Anyone have experience or advice? Maybe we need to see another specialist but I'm not even sure who that would be. She is not currently taking steroids either, although she was up until about a month ago. Log in to post a reply",
