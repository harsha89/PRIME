I had an ultra sound biopsy and post mammogram so a clip could be placed to monitor it. Basically fast forward 8 months later and its grown a centimeter(3.10) and my current doctor says that because of the rapid growth she believes it may be a phyllodes tumor. My other doctor told me it was just a Fibroadenoma but now i'm hearing things like the cells are very active and irregular and I wont know if it is a phyllodes or not until its removed and sent to pathology. And if it is i will need another surgery to remove breast tissue to make sure it doesn't reoccur. I'm new to all these new medical terms but I've had two ultra sounds and wondering what BIRADS 4 means and how do I find out what level I am? I wish you all the best and I am curious to know your results! â™¡",
