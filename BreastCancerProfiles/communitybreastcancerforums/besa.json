I would also want a sit down discussion with the oncologist about all my options if a bone scan was  -3....  bone building medications, the posibility of taking tamoxifen (which protects against bone loss) vs using an aromitase inhibitor etc.",

I think Nahabedian may also work out of one of the Northern Virginia hospitals (Fairfax Hospital)  -- he has offices at both Georgetown U. and in McLean, Va.  (Scott Spear at Georgetown does implants not microvascular reconstructions.)  Chang and Nahabedian were originally Hopkins ps but now have very big reconstructive programs at their respective hospitals. I think they have more experience (been doing this for a longer time) than the  microvascular ps at Hopkins. You want someone who does these surgeries on a regular basis, multiple times/week and has done multiple hundreds, much better yet.... 10000s (these numbers are surgeries done on their own, after microvascular fellowship or other training.) A good ps should have a large group of happy customers willing to talk to you.    Arrange to talk to them and if possible see their results in person.  Cosmetic enhancement is a different skill set than reconstruction so find someone who does mainly reconstructions.  ",

Even if every single breast tissue cell in the breast could be removed (which of course it can not) an ER positive woman with invasive bc would still need to take tamoxifen or an AI to cut down on the chance of getting metastatic disease.

The cosmetic outcome of a reconstruction depends a lot on the skill of the plastic surgeon and the breast surgeon who works with him/her- shop around and get a number of opinions.  You need a plastic surgeon who does the type of reconsturciton you want in high volume and does the surgery regularly (every week).    With the right plastic surgeon - the cosmetic results of mastectomy and reconstruction can be really good. I had a problematic unilateral skin sparing mastectomy with DIEP reconstruction done locally following a multifocal breast cancer diagnosis- turns out the plastic surgeon was well trained but inexperienced.   I  went back 4 year later and did a prophylactic nipple sparing mastectomy sGAP on the other side.  They also did some work to fix my DIEP reconstruction.  For my second surgery I traveled  to New Orleans to find a really skilled ps. They did a great job. Look at the reconstruction photos on this site:  www.breastcenter.com   Plastic surgeons often recommend the type of reconstruction they are technically able to do and down play or even disparage other options.  If you end up needing or wanting a mastectomy with reconstruction my advice is to figure out what type you want first and then go to the best plastic surgeon who specializes in what you want and talk to him/her about it.  Also, cosmetic enhancement requires a very different skill set than reconstruction.  You want to go to someone who specializes in reconstruction not enhancement.",

The counselor takes a detailed family history and then, either recommends testing or don't recommend testing.  Going to a genetic counselor also, I think, can make it easier to have health insurance cover the testing.  Other associated cancers are prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer, and I some others.  Go to the FORCE web site above for detailed information.  That would be a better place to post questions about breast cancer gene mutations.  There are other mutations that increase the chance of breast cancer.  Posting here for information is good but also try the FORCE web site for more detailed information.",

Source Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD, USA. hooverr@mail.nih.gov Abstract BACKGROUND: Before 1971, several million women were exposed in utero to diethylstilbestrol (DES) given to their mothers to prevent pregnancy complications. Several adverse outcomes have been linked to such exposure, but their cumulative effects are not well understood. METHODS: We combined data from three studies initiated in the 1970s with continued long-term follow-up of 4653 women exposed in utero to DES and 1927 unexposed controls. We assessed the risks of 12 adverse outcomes linked to DES exposure, including cumulative risks to 45 years of age for reproductive outcomes and to 55 years of age for other outcomes, and their relationships to the baseline presence or absence of vaginal epithelial changes, which are correlated with a higher dose of, and earlier exposure to, DES in utero. RESULTS: Cumulative risks in women exposed to DES, as compared with those not exposed, were as follows: for infertility, 33.3% vs. 15.5% (hazard ratio, 2.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.05 to 2.75); spontaneous abortion, 50.3% vs. 38.6% (hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.42 to 1.88); preterm delivery, 53.3% vs. 17.8% (hazard ratio, 4.68; 95% CI, 3.74 to 5.86); loss of second-trimester pregnancy, 16.4% vs. 1.7% (hazard ratio, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.56 to 5.54); ectopic pregnancy, 14.6% vs. 2.9% (hazard ratio, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.58 to 5.38); preeclampsia, 26.4% vs. 13.7% (hazard ratio 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.89); stillbirth, 8.9% vs. 2.6% (hazard ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.33 to 4.54); early menopause, 5.1% vs. 1.7% (hazard ratio, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.67 to 3.31); grade 2 or higher cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, 6.9% vs. 3.4% (hazard ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.59 to 3.27); and breast cancer at 40 years of age or older, 3.9% vs. 2.2% (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.18). For most outcomes, the risks among exposed women were higher for those with vaginal epithelial changes than for those without such changes. CONCLUSIONS: In utero exposure of women to DES is associated with a high lifetime risk of a broad spectrum of adverse health outcomes. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute.).",

As snowgirl63 said there is an Oncotype DX test that will give an estimate of an individual woman's risk of recurrence (used for women with ER positive, HER2 negative breast cancer, 0 to 3 positive nodes.) A low score would indicate that there is no benefit from chemo. I was stage 2A, node negative, had a mastectomy with reconstruction and also had an low Oncotype Dx score. The recommendation for me was not to have chemo. I did take hormonal therapy which reduces the risk of recurrence for women with ER+ breast cancer by about 1/2. In the U.S. early stage breast cancer patient are given personal statistics (statistics obtained from Oncotype Dx test) for our risk of recurrence with and without chemo, with and without hormone therapy. For me this information made the decisions about chemo and hormonal therapy much easier to make. In the U.S. an oncologist is the one who usually makes recommendations for or against chemo (generally the breast surgeon does not make recommendations concerning this). Has your mom seen an oncologist specializing in breast cancer? (Also does your know the status of her tumors hormone receptors -they are called estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2) ) which would help her know how effective hormonal therapy would be for her. see last link below) http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types... http://www.oncotypedx.com/  Some helpful information about hormone receptor status of breast cancer tumors: http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/diagnosis/her...

For me personally having and estimate of the probability of what may be makes it easier for me to handle things and prepare. The factors that influence the outcome, according to this Sloan Kettering \"Sentinal Lymph Node Metastasis\" predictive model, include:age, tumor size, tumor location, lymphovascular invasion, multifocality, grade, ER and PR status and a category called \"special type\" (see link for definition of what is classified as special type.)",

I am BRCA mutation negative but do have a family history of bc. (I am considered high risk but not as high as someone with a BRCA mutation.) I did not have sentinel node biopsy on my prophylactic side. I had a negative breast MRI and mammogram. That being said I was aware of the risk that I would face axillary dissection if cancer was discovered during pathology. NCCN guidelines version 2.2015 \"Breast Cancer Risk Reduction\" (see page BRISK-5) under foot note \"bb\" (foot note is on page BRISK-6) states that \"axillary node assessment has limited indication at the time of risk reduction surgery\" I have heard of some doctors injecting isotope and then mark the sentinel nodes with clips before prophylactic surgery so that they can go back later after mastectomy and remove the marked nodes if pathology warranted it. I think that some women who have had mastectomy & reconstruction at NOLA have talked about this. If you are interested it might be worth a post on Dr. DellaCroce's \"ask the doctor web site\" http://members.boardhost.com/plastic/  BethL - mapping the sentinel node can easily be done in a prophylactic setting. There is no need for a tumor to be present. The isotope is injected near the nipple and they locate the main nodes that are drained using a probe that detects radioactivity. The radioactivity can be injected the day before surgery or the day of surgery. I think the dye can be done in addition to isotope and is usually done at the time of surgery. lemonadehk- I was under the impression that the exposure to radiation from lymphoscintigraphy was much lower - see conclusion section in link below - which talks about exposure equal to from 1 to 5 chest x-ray exposures http://www.birpublications.org/doi/pdf/10.1259/bjr...

After researching things I think he is the most experience, high volume microvascular surgeon in the DC/Baltimore metro area. (I traveled to New Orleans for sGAP surgery and revision of a problematic contralateral DIEP that was originally done in the Maryland suburbs.) I am not a patient of Dr. Chang's but from my research he would be the first person I would consider in this area. He originally worked at Hopkins but then moved to Mercy. (My take on Hopkins is that the microvascular ps at Hopkins train there, and after that tend to stay for a relatively short time and then move on.) Think about getting a copy of the latest edition of Kathy Steligo's \"Breast Reconstruction Guidebook\" - the best I have seen on the topic. It will help you decide exactly what type of reconstruction you want and also help you choose a good ps. from amazon.com or from http://www.breastrecon.com/ A pedicled tram is a very different surgery from a free tram. The pedicled tram has many more issues and is no longer even offered at Hopkins because of its associated problems. First step- ask exactly what type of tram your current ps is offering. My take on things if if it is a pedicled tram I would immediately find another ps. My advice is go to the most skilled and experienced ps you can possibly find who offers the type of reconstruction you really want. If you want a DIEP travel for it (an hour is nothing in the scheme of things). This is a decision you will live with for the rest of your life. (As an aside I am happy with the decision I made in terms of type of reconstruction. It was the right decision for me. I am very active and have no physical limitations in terms of exercise. ) (Also - if you haven't already done so listen to Dr. DellaCroce's videocast on this site.)",

The incidence of DCIS has been increasing in the past decades, and this has been attributed to increased detection through breast cancer screening using mammograms. In the EORTC study, adjuvant radiotherapy after local excision reduced the incidence of both in situ and invasive local recurrences by a factor of two and resulted in an overall lower risk of mastectomy. Dr. Mila Donker of The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, and lead author of this paper says, \"Survival after treatment for DCIS is excellent. Therefore, the question rises whether the current treatment for DCIS (local excision and adjuvant radiotherapy of the breast) is overtreatment. To answer this question, not only long-term data about local disease recurrences and prognosis are important, but also information about the prognosis and treatment in case of recurrence.\" Between 1986 and 1996, the phase III EORTC trial 10853 randomized 1010 women with complete local excision of DCIS to no further treatment (503 patients) or radiotherapy (507 patients). The risk of any local recurrence was found to be reduced by 48% (HR: 0.52, 95%CI 0.40-0.68, P<0.001) in the patients who also received radiotherapy. The 15-year local recurrence-free rate was 69% for the group of patients receiving breast conserving surgery alone, but this increased to 82% for the group of patients who also received radiotherapy, and the 15-year invasive local recurrence-free rate was 84% versus 90%, respectively (HR: 0.61, 95%CI 0.42-0.87). The differences observed in local recurrence did not lead to differences in breast cancer specific survival or overall survival, but patients with invasive local recurrence did have a significantly worse breast cancer specific survival (HR: 17.66, 95%CI 8.86-35.18) as well as overall survival (HR: 5.17, 95%CI 3.09-8.66) than those who did not recur. Thus, an invasive recurrence resulted in a worse prognosis. A lower overall salvage mastectomy rate after a local recurrence was also observed in the group of patients who also received radiotherapy, 13%, than in those patients who just received breast conserving surgery, 19%. Thus, radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery for DCIS resulted in an overall lower percentage of patients who were treated with a mastectomy after a local recurrence. This study highlights the importance of conducting long term follow-up.\"",

Now a biology lession- I don't know if you have learned about this in biology class yet (I guess I will see how good I am at explaining things): Cells have receptors on their surface.  A protein is able to bind and fit into the receptor.  It is sort of like the receptor is a \"lock\" and the protein (a hormone) is a \"key.\"  In this case when the \"key\" fits into these \"locks\" they cause the cells to grow.  Breast cancer cells can have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)  receptors.  These 3 different receptors can be blocked with specific drugs - for example tamoxifen is a drug used to block the estrogen receptor. Tamoxifen will help keep cancer cells with estrogen receptors from growing.  Your mom's cancer cells do not have these receptors so other different drugs or treatments are used.  As \"37 antiques\" said not all breast cancers are the same - and the treatment will be different depending on what works best for the kind of breast cancer a woman has.",

It would be nice to be able to change the interaction so you get what you need.  It may or may not be possible.  The idea is to get through this as best you can. ",

      "Content": "Aug 28, 2014 08:38PM - edited Aug 28, 2014 08:45PM by besa I had a \"suture granulomas\" also called \"spitting a stitch\" which fit your description. It happened closer to when my reconstructive surgery was performed (and had nothing to do with tattooing).   Not sure of the time frame in terms of how long this can happen but I think it can be within the time frame you mention.  If this does turn out to be what you are dealing with it is basically the body's immune response to an internal suture.  In my case my ps just told me what it was and didn't seem to be concerned - just asked me to keep it clean while it healed.   Consider calling your  surgeon's office now (instead of being concerned and worrying for the next two weeks) and just describe what your are seeing.  See what they think and ask them how you should handle the situation.  ",
