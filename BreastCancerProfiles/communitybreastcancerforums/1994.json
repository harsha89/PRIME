I have gone back to gp and been referred to a breast specialist for further investigation, with possible MRI. my bloods showed no signs of infection or inflammation so no point giving me antibiotics again when they were not useful. It could just be nothing but I need to know for piece of mind. My ultrasound showed next to nothing although the report says hypoechoic region (appears to be early mastitis (of which it's not)) and also that I had increased vascularity (increased blood flow) .  Just kind of a wait and see....",

      "Content": "1994 wrote: Hi, Just thought I would share what it going on, I'm sure it may be nothing serious but it's hard to know when I haven't had any testing. I noticed a pain in my left breast a 2-3 months ago and didn't even think of it.. (I have next to know breasts so change is obvious, and never had pain other than blocked ducts when previously breastfeeding) (I haven't breastfed in over a year) Then one day when taking off my bra my breast felt quite hot and swollen, I looked in the mirror and could see a very obvious circular swelling on my breast (behind nipple and around 3-6 o clock). I was a bit worried and booked into the doctorst straight away. (this is a few weeks after I initially felt pain). I was referred to get an Ultrasound which showed no lump, just increased blood flow which could mean infection(mastitis??? Even though not breastfeeding), so I was given 5 days of antibiotics. The second day of antibiotics I felt very unwell and had a temp. Was fine after that and breast pain (feels like a bruise) went away. The day after I had finished the course the pain was back instantly. Back to the doctors again and this time she gave me a 10 day course of antibiotics, pain subsided after 4 days in, and the day after I finished the course pain is back! On next visit she said she will refer me to a breast specialist... I'm just blown as to what's going on. Just want to share. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
