We do a bone scan and brain MRI and rib biopsy next week. We don't see a dr for another two weeks. I will look up the drug you are taking. I'm curious if it can work in both the bone mets and these possible lung mets. How do they confirm that the nodules in her lungs are cancer? That's great news that your medicine is working! ",

My mom was diagnosed in feb with breast cancer. Today she was told it has spread. It is on her spine in a couple places and her ribs on each side. They also found 50 nodules between both herlungs. I couldn't form a sentence at the appointment to even begin to ask questions. So I'm asking you ladies to hopefully ease my mind. Is 50 nodules common for met to lungs? On her k chart it actually says \" unfortunately\" there are several nodules on both lungs. Is this something that can be treated? My mom has never had bronchitis or anything we can think of that would explain the nodules. Assuming it's cancer, please tell me the doctors aren't going to tell us she has months to live. Years would be wonderful!",

      "Content": "Jennmadd wrote: Hello I have two loved ones recently diagnosed with breast cancer. I have been doing lots of reading trying to educate myself. I see the term early breast cancer a lot. Is treatment for early breast cancer that different than breast cancer that is \"not early\" what does this really mean? My mom has her bilateral mastectomy tuesday. We don't even have all her info yet or MRI results back. All that we know is that her tumor is grade 3 and a t4 ( because it is pushing out against the skin) If my research is correct this would automatically put her at stage lllb. Why is this not considered early breast cancer? Will treatment be that much different? I see a lot of stuff on the net about treatment for early breast cancer. Also everyone always asks \" did they catch it early\" Im so frustrated with that term. She has a mammogram 6 months ago and they were not concerned about the lump then. Any insight in this would be appreciated.

And because we are waiting for MRI results for more info I thought this one was most relevant. I'm not sure I'm grasping the post in one thread concept. I guess all my questions are better suited for her doctors. Just trying to grasp what's going on. I found very helpful information from reading posts on here and from all the responses I got. You ladies are courageous even in the face of fear. I don't think that my worries are helpful to anyone here and being that I myself am not going through this horrble disease I think I should find another site to vent. I appreciate the support your site has given me to be able to be strong for my mom and grandma. I will tell them about it and perhaps they can join for encouragement and support. Best wishes, Jennifer",

She was scheduled to have another on March 31st but it was cancelled due to her circumstances changing. She has just started losing a lot of her hair and her scalp hurts. Will this process stop now that she isn't taking any more chemo or is the damage done already and she will lose the rest of her hair? Thanks for any answers",

Very hard to do, but I think it is what we need to do. I'm so sorry about your momma and so sorry you are faced with this. You have my prayers. Please keep us updated.",
