I was diagnosed on Dec.3rd 2014 and went through a battery of tests, and felt like each time I was shoved back into that perpetual waiting room. Now, I had my mastectomy on the 30th and waiting once again on the final pathology report. I can say though, after surgery, I did not feel depressed by how I looked and although a smidge bummed, I still feel confident. I saw it as a hurdle and an acheivement. Each hurdle you leap over, the more confident you feel. Keep your sense of humor up, it is SO important and lean on your support system. Your family and friends are itching to help you. I try not to lean too much, because independence is important too, but allow yourself to \"trust fall\" into your supportive wall of love when you need it, every time. Body surf over your support and feel the waves of comfort wash over you.",

Well, I had several issues with the original Oncologist that made me uncomfortable long story short. I went to my primary doctor for a referral to a new Oncologist and one that was closer. The new doctor pointed out the positive margin right away and asked me about it. I was stunned. I didn't have a clue. She got on the phone w/ the pathologist and confirmed it was in fact positive and I had bloodwork for chemo and left with office with the plan to see the breast surgeon she uses for a 2nd opinion. I am still going to that this upcoming Wednesday the 25th. Well, I get a call back, and Doc says she spoke w/ original surgeon that did my surgery and was told it went to the skin line and he could not take any more skin? Though I was told I had a skin sparing mastectomy? Well, the thought now, is this will be taken care of through radiation w/ a \"boost\" to the area in question, unless this new surgeon thinks she can get more under surgery. If no surgery, I begin chemo Thursday, and that (should) be the plan. IDK for sure. Any experience w/ what skin line means? Today is a good day to be a good day!

The doctor came in and looked at the pics and ultrasounded herself. They measured and talked quitely. She gave me a towel and said that the Mammogram and ultrasound looked very worriesome. Since she had just ultrasounded the lymphnodes, I asked if they were normal and the doctor said yes. I was shaken up and said that is good right? She said yes it is. I said you are worried about cancer then. She said yes I am. She said there were 4 tumors that grew into one. I basically drew a blank and it felt surreal. I hadn't a clue what to ask. I was sent to another area to schedule a core biopsy. The nurse said it could be benign, or hyperplasia or cancer. She was reassuring, but also not in the room during diagnostics. The doctor that was in the room was solemn, quite and her eyes seem to tell me that she felt strongly it was cancer. What should I be asking? Any advice? Biopsy is Monday. December.1st.

The body needs to break up the clots on it's own and the blood thinners prevent more. It does hurt, but my port was acessed a little early too so that could be a part of the pain I would imagine.",

I was originally thought to have had 2.7cm via core biopsy guided ultrasound. After surgery, it ended up being 8.6cm. 2.7cm invasive, with the rest being in situ (contained). If you do not have a multi focal disease like me (multiple tumors in same breast) you may be a lumpectomy candidate. You sound like you are very strong!",

I asked about the oncotype test and he said that would be included but did not mention it taking 2 weeks. My oncologist said I would start chemo in about 3-4 weeks after surgery and I wonder if the oncotype test is a big deciding factor in a hormone positive individual. I did score a 40 in the KI-67 antigen test the one that determines how many of the cancer cells are dividing. So 60% are not and 40% are and was told anything over 20 is unfavorable. Just wondering Kristin",

I called the surgeon and he said no way related to mastectomy which was 12/30/14. He says call Oncologist. And the pain is on the left side where the clots and port are. Oncologist says not related to clots. I don't know if I should assume it IS related to the clots, or be more pushy with the doctor or give it more time to see if it goes away. AND ALL of this ONLY started after surgery.",

It may not happen to you, but it did to me, but nothing at all over the top, but worth mentioning. Shaking and jitteryness. Racey heart, and heavy compression feeling in chest. Much like an asthma attack and using a Proventil inhaler afterwards. Also, sedation! Again nothing I couldn't handle, but I DO wish they had warned me. I do not like being blindsided.
