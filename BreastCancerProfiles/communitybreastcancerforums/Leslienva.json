I'm also going to ask my oncologist about the nausea. Maybe she can prescribe something that works better than whatever was in my pre-chemo meds.  Hope everyone is doing well! Leslie",

But having said that, I probably had more good days than bad days and since it was just four treatments, it was over pretty quickly. Just don't over do it. If you're tired, be sure to rest. You'll be having chemo around the holidays, so try to order your gifts on line and be careful being around crowds because it's easy to get a cold when your immune system is compromised. There's usually a monthly group starting on here for new chemo patients so if one hasn't started, you may want to start one. Last year we commiserated with each other and ended up starting a group on Facebook. Good luck! I'm sure you'll do fine!",

I used Toppik to cover the spot in front, but the hair grew back pretty quickly. I think the women on ACT seem to have a harder time keeping their hair than those on Taxotere/Cytoxan. Your shedding four months after the chemo/cold capping was probably due to your surgery and anesthesia. I had a lot of shedding after I had to get my left expander replaced in April. There's a nausea drug they often give you called Emend that causes hair loss. I'm going to avoid it when I have my implant exchange surgery.",

I read that the average woman loses 40 to 100 strands a day normally. Fine hair sheds more. I'm at almost four weeks out and still shedding, but we have to factor in that we would shed even if we weren't on chemo. So don't panic too much!",

I've been using Toppik to cover it, but I'm hoping it's just temporary! I'm 11 weeks out from treatment. Also, are you getting bone pain from Arimidex? Several friends have had issues with it and switched to Aromasin, which is what I'm on. I haven't noticed it causing any shedding or bone pain--just a few more hot flashes.",
