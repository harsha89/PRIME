      "Content": "Ker10 wrote: Hello Ladies,  First of all this is a wonderful and supportive site so happy I came across it. Dec 20th while studying I felt a lump under my nipple, hard jagged seemed to have no end. The next day I went to see my doctor, he referred me to get an ultrasound the next day.    Waited until the 27th to get the results (because of the holiday). They came back with concerns, so my doctor referred me to see a breast surgeon to get more information.  This appointment is this Monday morning, January 9th 2012.  My symptoms keep getting worse, the bump is getting larger, I feel nausia, tightening in my chest and found a swollen lymph node in my chest while working last night.   I just got past a recent bout with mono in November and hoping this is because of the mono, but never have a swollen chest node because of it.  My body doesn't feel itself and has not for a few months, this waiting is not helping.  I am trying my best to be and stay strong until the results, but find myself weak and worried at times. Thank you for listening,  All the best, Kerri  Dx 2/18/2012, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 1/40 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

She examined me and from the ultrasound were able to rule it out as a cyst. So I am getting a core needle biopsy later this week! She has eased my anxiety knowing if it is bad she will be my surgeon! Should have the results back next week! Hoping for the best!",

The mass has to be surgically removed because of its size and further testing, but assured me it was non cancerous.  I should be getting it removed in a few weeks. Through this I realized I am not a strong as I thought I was and I would be lucky to be half as strong as most of you women!  Keep fighting and thanks again ladies. ",
