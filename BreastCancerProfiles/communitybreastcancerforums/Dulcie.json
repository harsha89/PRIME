Since then...the area has felt not quite right.....the outside of the cheek is all swollen and it has never gone down!  (look a bit chipmunky) lol A few years ago i had a biopsy on the other side of the jaw ..as they saw shades of grey in the jaw and brought a specialist face surgeon in to look and he did the biopsy ..... i have always had a lump (same side) in the neck which was biopsied too! Now I AM  a lumpy person anyway...but this thing with the swelling in the jaw has got me really worried....",
