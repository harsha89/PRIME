I have to wait to see if this reconstruction surgery will be what I can do after surgery and radiation. I appreciate the hint. Tomorrow is CT scan day, then results next Monday. Then, I can look to see if one or both be removed. This is the hardest decision to make.",

I have not taken anything today. Other than excessive drainage, I am doing well. I have not been emotional as I thought I would be. I continue to tell myself that this is God's path for me and how I can have a second chance at life. I am still a woman which I thought would be my issue of not being a woman.",

I have a follow up appointment on Thursday with the doctor, I am tired but the excersizes given feel great. Yes they hurt a bit but need to push forward. I had lymph nodes removed and this is where the surgical site hurts the most. Extra padding has helped, a mini pad. ðŸ˜Š No matter what the results, push forward, endure the pain because my life is what iwant.",

I had my last chemo treatment on 1-30, feeling blessed about that, in pain today but the doctors tell me this is the worst part of treatment. Emotions are now really setting in and scaring me.
