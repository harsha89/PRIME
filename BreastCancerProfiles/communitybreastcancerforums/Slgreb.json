I had already decided that when it really started to go it all had to go. I do not like a short hair cut and it still wouldn't help the fact it would fall out. I did better than I thought, and my hubby was by my side taking pictures for me. I used the salon at MD Anderson. It is free to patients. But I was also blessed with a free wig, cotton skull cap, bandana and scarf. They showed meÂ ways to tie the scarf and bandana, told me how to take care of the wig and just took care of me. I recommend using their services if you are a patient at MD Anderson. Live by faith, not by fear.",

From a lot of what I read I see that most have their AC (mine will be FAC) first and taxol next. Mine is the other way around. I wonder what the reasoning for that would be. I did not ask my oncologist as I had no idea about any of this until I started reading the boards. I started my chemo at MD Anderson, and will be switching to a local oncologist after my next treatment. He stated at our consultation that although it is a regimine in the standard of care that it is not their normal regimine. I will have 12 weekly doses of Taxol followed by a 3 day FAC infusion every 3 weeks for 4 treatments. Not sure what's to come, but I know God's got this. Praying for you all.
