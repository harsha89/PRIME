My first recurrence started after 4.5 years, with pain but the doctors could not find anything, After treeatment with  gemzar, taxotere and herceptine, i was improved, but now I am in horrible pain again and the doctor doesn't start anything yet. I went to a second opinion doctor and he told me that my bc has changed the pathology frpm er pozitivr, pr negative, her pozitive, to borderline fpor the three of them. He said to me to do pet scan instead that MRI and cat scan. Almots three months and I have not started anything but Zeloda and herceptine. The second doctor told me that I am no longer receptor positive, so i should start  other treatments. Anybody in the same position. limon Log in to post a reply",
