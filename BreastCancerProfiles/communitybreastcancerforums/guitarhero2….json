Thanks again for all the links you provided--I learned way more than I learned from my therapist. My therapist is not a PT, she's a Certified Manual Lymph Drainage Therapist (in fairness to her, I remember that she specifically said she is not a PT, she's a CMLDT). I called her yesterday to ask her some follow up questions and here's what she said (I'm sharing this with you because I'm very sure this is not an example of a good and helpful therapist): Q: When I wear my Tubigrip sleeve at night, my hand is swollen in the morning. What should I do? A: 1. Don't wear the sleeve at night, or 2. Wear the sleeve but buy a weight lifting glove to wear with it. (She specifically told me previously that I should always wear my sleeve at night.) Q: Can't I get a compression sleeve with a glove? A:  If you want to get a compression sleeve, order one online. Get one with 30-40 compression, class 2, and either Juzo or Jobst brands. As far as gloves, gloves are very expensive and can cost up to $1,000. Q: So I can just go online and order a sleeve? Don't you need to measure me? And isn't there an Isotoner support glove I could get (which I saw for $16 on Amazon)? A: Sure, if you want me to measure you, I can. (She then gave me guidelines on measuring myself.) And oh yes, you can get an Isotoner but make sure it fits properly. She still never talked about wrapping, and didn't in any way encourage me to come back in to continue sessions with her....which I'm not! I'm looking for a different therapist. Meanwhile, I haven't been wearing my Tubigrip at all because it makes my hand swollen and doesn't seem to help with bringing down the swelling anyway. I'm feeling very frustrated because she hasn't been helpful at all and seems so lackadaisical. I guess I was just supposed to be satisfied for the rest of my life with the three Tubigrip sleeves she gave me. Wish me luck in finding a new PT!  Michelle ",
