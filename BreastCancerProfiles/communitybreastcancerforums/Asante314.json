Its been a busy week. joyandpiece, here's hoping you get to some quilting Ruthi, & 123abc1611 The first few days post Mx I was not even awake. Let us know how you are when you are ready. When you do wake and deal with the drains, know they do come out eventually!

At that time I didn't even understand why. I asked my BS at my pre-op about PT, and she said I wold start after the drains were out. However my BS and PS are from different hospitals, (but PS visits BS facility once monthly so they can work together, old training buddies). BS is closer, but not sure which makes more sense, as I would be going to PS for fills at some point. And still not sure if it is something they mention, or something I definitely need to follow through. Guess I will put it on my list of questions when I am in the hospital. My surgery is 3-14, but my first appt w BS is 4-5. PS deals with everything except the pathology was the explanation.",

You will find a very supportive community of wonderful women, and a few men as well. As far as a second opinion, some would say if it is different and you are not significantly more comfortable with one then the other, seek a third, tiebreaker opinion. You ultimately have to be comfortable with your decision. Will you have a medical oncologist as well. Additionally, letting us know your type of cancer is more helpful for further insight. I had a lumpectomy/ excisional biopsy in May, but am now having a BMX in March followed by TE w implants. I switched breast surgeons between the surgeries because I did not like the plastic surgeon she worked with. I equally love my new breast surgeon. Both surgeons and my medical oncologist rec BMX, so the decision was made. I just had to find the right team for me. You have time, to figure this out over a few weeks, some say 3 months at most. I understand getting it over with. As my date approaches it both can not get here fast enough, but it is too soon as well!. hugs asante",
