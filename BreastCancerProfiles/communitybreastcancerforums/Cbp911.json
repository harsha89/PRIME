Right before I had my annual mammo last week I had told my mom that for some reason I was actually having some anxiety this year. It may be because I have 4 friends of mine between 35-43yrs old going thru treatment right now. I am not sure but in my gut I just felt off. That takes me to my screening where of course I would get called back because of a new cluster of calcifications in my right breast. Went back this past Monday for mag views and ultrasound. The radiologist could not determine exactly what he was looking at so he wants me to get a biopsy next Monday. My report is a BiRads 4. Shows ill-defined, amorphous cluster of calcifications with a complicated cyst with associated shadowing. Hate having to wait to find out exactly what is going on. Log in to post a reply",
