    "Content": "nursemom wrote: I am 39 years old and went for my first mammogram.  Suspicious areas were found,so I had an ultrasound and 4 biopsies the following day.  After the worst week of my life, I was told I have DCIS of the right breast with a 7mm invasive cancer in the right breast.  Because of the extent of the DCIS, a mastectomy is scheduled.  My surgeon had me get an MRI of both breasts to ensure the left breast was clear.  I have seen the MRI report that shows 2 suspicious dense areas in the left breast.  Unfortunately I will not see the surgeon until next week but am now having horrible anxiety that the cancer is in both breasts.  Is this uncommon?  And does it make my chance for lymph node involvement higher.  The surgeon had assured me that the chance for lymph node involvment with a tumor that size is very unlikely, but now its all I can think about.  Any advice would be great!
