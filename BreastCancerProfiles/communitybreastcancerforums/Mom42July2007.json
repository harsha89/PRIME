Found lump in Left Breast on June 18th, the evening before I left for a 10 day business trip to Belgium. Made appointment with Primary for July 2nd (first workday that I was back in USA), refered to surgeon on July 3rd, Mamogram and Ultrasound on July 5th. Radiologist said he was 90% sure just calcium. Surgeon called on July 6th, recommended surgery to remove lump to be 100%...surgery was on Friday, July 13th. Results came on Weds the 18th...it is cancer. So I'm 3 days into this. Did meet with surgeon for discussion on Thursday. All I know is tumor showed no clean margin so I'm scheduled for more surgery next friday the 27th. He is going to remove more tissue to try to get a clean margin and they will also perform sentinel node procedure and remove 2 lymph nodes for testing. I also have appointment on Tues the 24th with an oncologist. Surgeon said they were still awaiting results of hormone and genic testing from the tumor and that results of this next surgery would then give them all the pieces of the puzzle do determine what the best treatment path is. It's horrible not knowing....I've read through a few other posts and I just want to know what stage or type...something more then I have breast cancer. Does anyone know at waht point they can tell you what stage it is? Should the oncologist beable to tell me more on Tuesday before the next surgery? Also any from MA that might be familiar with Hallmark Health/Chem Center in Stoneham MA? So far surgeon and everyone at Melrose/Walefield hospital has been great but family thinks I should switch to hospital in Boston for better care. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
