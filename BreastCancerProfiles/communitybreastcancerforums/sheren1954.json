Had a lot of labs drawn including a tumor marker. Reality just sets in more and more everyday. He ordered a PET scan, and MUGA scan. Surgery is scheduled for Nov. 13th. He said depending on what the PET scan shows he may need to delay the surgery....checking for any further lymph node involvement. Also asked him about the insulin potentiation therapy. He says there has only been study about this and its from Uraguay. Nothing proven, and the study did not follow the participents long term. He advised against it because there is no scientific proof that it works. He recommended to me to stay on my vitamins, PC-95, COQ10, multiple vitamin, and calcium with vit D. Anything with anti-oxidates in them I cannot take when it gets closer to doing the chemo. I really like him and feel like I can trust him. That's half the battle. Will let everyone know my results...still feel like I'm in limbo.",

He told me that I have \"triple neg. breast cancer.\" Is anyone familiar with this? I know that its estrogen receptor neg, progesterone receptor neg and HER2 neg. I have a 2.9 cm mass, and 2 + axillary lymph nodes. Everything I'm reading is telling me that this is an aggressive type of breast cancer. I have had some hip pain for several months now. So, I'm having a bone scan on Nov.2  I don't think I've been this scared in a very long time. I can't find anything about this cancer on this site.",

I do have lymph node involvement and can actually feel the mass on my left breast extending under my arm. I can't finish a meal...weird, I'm not hungry and haven't been for several weeks. Is this part of the diagnosis? I can eat a little and start feeling sick to my stomach part way through then push my food away. I have to have an MRI tomorrow to see if the cancer has spread to my right breast. Then I see a radiology oncologist on Wednesday. Things are happening pretty fast and I'm really scared!!!
