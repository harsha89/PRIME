Here is my scenario: I am 24 years old, 20 weeks pregnant and have a crazy history of cancer in both my mom's side of the family as well as my dad's. About 2.5 weeks ago I came home from work and took my bra off to discover my breasts were very mishapen and looked welted. I assumed my bra was too tight and left it off the rest of the night, which really didn't do much. So at that point I just stuck to sports bras or not wearing a bra, which too did not do much. I tried applying ice packs and heat to get it to go away (worse in my left breast, by the way)...but nothing seemed to work. It is not painful. Being as I am pregnant I assumed it was probably a clogged duct and did not call the doctor until about a week later when the skin where it looks welted and like an orange peel became numb. I now have very thick skin on the inner part somewhat close to my areola that is numb. My breasts still have somewhat of a swollen odd shape. No masses were found on my ultrasound but the skin was very thick they said. My mam came back clean but now they want to do a biopsy. My skin occasionally gets a burning sensation outside of where the orange peel affect is happening, and occasionally some itching. My nipples are not inverted by any means but have kind of turned outward a little. I have a slight redness but nothing major. They have ruled out a clogged duct at this point through ultrasound and because I have no fever or any other infection symptoms really they seem rather concerned. Any suggestions?? Should I be worried? Jessy Log in to post a reply",
