We are aloud crap days. It's hard when our kids go away, I don't know if we every really see them as grown up? I have one son 20 and one 14 and I still buy school clothes and wonder how in the world am I buying stuff so big? I don't feel like I can truly vent to friends or family (I seem to need to reassure them) but on here it's different and feel like I can be honest. I am thinking of you.",

Today they came in and said it may be in my bile duct or gallbladder as well. I was eight yrs free so totally understand your numbness. We have kids close in age and will be here for them for years to come. hugs.",
