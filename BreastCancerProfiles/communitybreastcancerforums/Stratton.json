I was given biopsy report on February 27th. I then had a galatinum (?) MRI, that showed some lesions on my liver. I will be having an abdominal ultrasound tomorrow.  I also had a bone scan after biospy report at my request as I have had a lot of pain the past 6 months that I had previously written off to stress. Scan showed three hot spots. I am going for x-rays of these areas tomorrow as well. I finally met with surgeon last week and surgery is schedule for April 21. I am not sure if I will chose masectomy or lumpectomy. If I knew for sure there were spread I might go for lumpectomy only. The surgeon will not advise on merits of PET scan. The province I live in does not publicly fund them. The private PET scan clinic claims there test is conclusive for bone spread and says x-rays are not. The surgeon says nothing is conclusive. The nurse says the hospital study showed PET was not accurate for axilla spread. If I am going to go pre-surgery, I need to arrange to go out of town next week for this. I am a bit nervous about getting such a big dose of radiation and then letting things brew for the 10 weeeks or more until chemo starts. This thing has already been pierced 5 times for biopsy plus I had a dose of radiation with bone scan. On the other hand, if there is really bone spread, perhaps they should start chemo immediately??   The liver lesions could possbily be due to antibiotic induced hepatitis I suffered as a child. The bone scan reads, possible arthritis in back and benign bony lesion on humorus bone. The PET scan rep says there is not really any such thing as benign bony lesion...esp. as I have pain there and it is on same side as cancer. Any advice from reading or experience is appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
