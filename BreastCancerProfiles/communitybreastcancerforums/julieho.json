The radiologist recommendations was to keep an eye on this one and repeat ultra sound in 3 -4 months or \"alternatively\" do a Fine Needle Aspiration. I see my oncologist tomorrow for a routine follow up.  I am feeling like I want to push for the FNA.   I have a genetic mutation (not BRCA) but a rare one that predisposes me to cancer, a high rate of familial cancers and on a routine MRI done on my breast prior to my cancer diagnoses they found something that they called me back in for.  They ultrasounded it and said they didn't think it was cancer so didn't biopsy it.  6 months later, in the exact same spot after my routine mammogram they called me back again for an ultrasound - same place, the \"spot\" had now tripled in size from what they had found on the MRI 7 months earlier and the biopsy showed it was an agressive cancer and HER2 positive.  Double mastectomy, heavy duty chemo and herceptin for a year.  Not sure I like the \"wait and see\" approach.  I also have noticed that thryoid cancers grow slowly and I am a bit frightened of the FNA procedure.  I would love if any of you would share your experience. I am leaning towards asking her to do the FNA now and not wait 3 -4 months for another ultrasound.  (Report is below) Thanks - Julieho",

I have been getting annual mammograms and MRI's for five years and in the winter of 2012 was tested for the BRACA gene mutations and did not have them. Four months later, May 2012 I was diagnosed with Stage 1, Grade 3, HER2 Positive Breast cancer and underwent a Bi-lateral Mastectomy, reconstruction and chemotherapy and a year of herceptin treatments. This summer I did more testing for a larger panel of genetic screening and was just called and told that one of the genes was positive for a mutation. It is called the NBN gene. I haven't yet met with the familial cancer oncologist and genetic counselor to better understand what exactly this means for me and my family. Do any of you have any experience with these more indepth genetic cancer screening test?

The little I have been able to research about this gene mutation is that it runs in people of slavic descent - which is strange because as far as I knew my mothers family was english/welch on my maternal grandfathers side and english/german on my maternal grandmothers side. But, I am wondering now if the German in my mothers family - which were my great grandparents, so it was prior to the \"East/West Europe\" distinction were in fact Eastern European Germans. Anyway, I will find out more on November 7th when I meet with my genetic counselor and the familial cancer specialist but sometimes I have found this site to be really helpful in finding out what actual women have experienced themselves so I thought I would also post it here. I agree with you - that if you have a strong family history get a more complete genetic screening than just the Brca test. Although, like you I was negative for that and four months after found out I had breast cancer so the genetic testing helps you understand your risk, etc. but by no means is a clear indicator either way that you will or will not have the disease. Thanks for posting. Julieho",

I met with the genetic counselor yesterday and all I know is that it was a 40 gene panel done from a blood draw and sent to the University of Washington Medical Center and is called a BROCA cancer risk panel. I tested positive for what is called a heterozygous deleterious mutation in the NBN gene. This mutation is linked in studies to a two to threefold risk ratio for breast cancer vs the regular population and is also possibly linked to colon, sarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma and prostate - although there have not yet been any conclusive studies for this gene mutation in those cancer groups. I was told that because I already had a BMX when they found the tumor in my left breast and was treated with chemo and herceptin for my HER2 positive status that my follow up would remain the same. No annual scans, 10 year checks for colon cancer, annual skin checks and every three month follow ups with my breast surgeon or oncologist. If I have any symptoms of concern they would of course follow up on those. My children will be tested to see if they inherited this gene mutation but not until they are 35 years old as that is when the genetic counselor and oncologist felt a positive for this gene mutation would mean they would begin screening for breast cancers and at 40 begin screening for colon, prostate (in the males) and skin cancers. Not sure if this is helpful to you but wanted to follow up. Take care, Julieho",

We finally tested my deceased maternal Aunt who died if breast cancer and she also has the same NBN mutation that I have. Two of her children got colon cancer in their fifties, one died and so far the other survived.   What is odd is with all the breast, lung, colon, and other cancers into maternal family and confirming that two generations of us have these gene mutation they don't seem interested in studying our family, which we offered.  They keep saying well we don't really know a lot about the NBN mutation so just ask family members to be screened prior to age forty and if they have it we will watch them more closely.   Due to all of my aunts and Mom having multiple breast and other cancers and having two maternal cousins die one of breast the other of colon and now two more, myself having breast and a cousin having colon this seems counterintuitive. Very frustrating and I am so frightened I passed this mutation along to my children.  They will be screened for it when they are 35. Thanks for posting jarmick and vfay49. Julieho",

I don't know what the new A or B means in relationship to my stage. I have a horrible family history, maternal side all women in my Mom's generation had multiple cancers including breast and all died of cancer. A maternal cousin died at age 27 of breast, two other maternal cousins had colon cancers in early 50's, when I was diagnosed with breast. One died, one has survived so far. My Aunt who banked DNA and myself tested positive for an NBN gene mutation. Not a lot is known other than a mutation in this gene is linked to higher rates of breast, colon, prostate and I think blood cancer. My oncologist wanted me to have a BMX, even though it was Stage 1 because of family history, I wanted the same. I also underwent Taxol/Carboplatin and Herceptin. I had immediate reconstruction with expanders, very serious post-op infection 10 days later, expander removed - chemo, expander replaced on left, another infection, finally implants in May 2013. Very painful, hard and iron bra feeling. Developed auto-immune disease probably from the extensive antibiotics I was on for a year. Have chronic muscle and joint pain and Hasimoto's disease which is in the thyroid. I just had DIEP surgery 5 weeks ago to replace my implants that were so painful. Surgery went well but I have had constant problems with severe pain in my chest bone. I had a pre-op chest x-ray but my breathing has felt \"off\" for the last year, I have a small bump on my wrist, started out last year the size of a pencil tip and now is the size of an eraser. My mother also was diagnosed with cancer at 50, first was lung (she was an ex-smoker), they found it on an X-ray done as a \"test\" so she was operable. She then has breast cancer (a separate cancer not a metasticist) at age 53, the same age I was. Had a mastectomy - two years later she had cancer in the other breast - a new cancer again, not a metasticist. Then she had bladder cancer which was treated on and off for years, again a new cancer and finally at age 64 she had a sarcoma which did metastisize and she died at 65. The protocol now is to not scan for cancer. Wait until you have symptoms lasting more than 3 weeks and then they test accordingly. Lately on the DIEP surgery thread I have had woman after woman find out they developed cancer elsewhere and when I ask how they found it they say from scans. I feel crazy with worry about the pain in my sternum, the breathing, the thing on my wrist that keeps growing. But, whenever I raise these I am told everything is fine, but I don't understand how we know that. And, I understand that metastatic cancer isn't necessarily treated better if it is found early or not, which is why they wait for us to be symptomatic, but with my family history I am worried also about \"new\" cancers. In my Mom's case she survived as long as she did from all those cancers because they detected them all early. I also know there is a huge risk of radiation exposure (I did not have to have radiation therapy for my BC) in doing a full body CT scan but a part of me so wants to just once know I am completely free of cancer. What are your thoughts? Julieho",

I recently had another surgery to remove implants that were very painful (my body had lots of infections with them so I think they just weren't meant to be for me) I had the DIEP surgery almost three weeks ago and feel spacier and like my memory and concentration is worse than ever. I think anesthesia and pain meds triggered it and it is worse than ever. I believe as I heal physically (which I hear takes several more weeks) and emotionally I will regain at least the semi-scattered brain I had before this. Also I think the fact that we linger with fears of metasticis or new cancers it creates a lot of stress in our focus and memory. I think this fear will subside as we get further away from diagnosis and treatment and follow up surgeries etc. Finding a new normal I belueve will happen, I started getting there again and then this surgery took me back a few steps. But just keep moving forward, don't fear asking your doctor or other women questions and in time I think we will hopefully all improve. Take care Julieh",

I also have a gene mutation linked to Breast and other cancers (NBN) mutation and a really extensive maternal family history of breast and colon cancer. I have never been given a full CT or PET scan. I have been told just let them know if I have any symptoms that persist more than three weeks, such as cough, or bone pain. I also developed some auto-immune conditions post treatment and developed fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis post-treatment. I feel like I constantly have pain in places throughout my body. I get the risk of high dose radiation from these test but also feel like I would love to KNOW that I am cancer free which I feel like only one of these test could confirm. My Mom had two different breast cancers and three other cancers (not metasticis) before she eventually had sarcoma that did metastasize and become fatal. Both her sisters had secondary cancers to Breast and 1 cousin died of breast, another of colon and a third has so far survived colon cancer. My sister just had prophylactic mastectomies because she also tested positive for the NBN mutation and even though her mammogram and MRI showed no cancer when they biopsied her Breast tissue she had DCIS. I don't know if the risk of the CT is greater than the stress I live with if not feeling I know whether or not I am cancer free. I want to talk more with my onc about this so any advice is appreciated. Take care, Julieho",
