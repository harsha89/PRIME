I went into menopause after chemo and my onc said that was the best thing that could ever happen to me because I was so highly hormone-positive. I am two years out and on Tamoxifen (no AI for me because I have a very high risk of osteoporosis). The side effects stink, but taking vitamins for energy, and Tazo Calm tea and melatonin to sleep helps a lot.  If I hadn't gone into menopause I would have had Lupron shots or the ooph, just because of being so highly hormone-positive. http://www.hystersisters.com is a great website for women considering an ooph or who have had one. ",

All the more reason for us ER/PR+ gals to keep taking those AIs or tamoxifen! I wonder if the reason for the higher ER/PR+ recurrence rates is that tamox and AIs are only given for five years? Maybe we need to take them longer. As far as Stage III is concerned, I believe that women who might have been considered Stage IIb in the past are now sometimes being reclassified as Stage III. That is, it's no longer considered necessary to have fixed or matted nodes or a huge tumor - just over a certain size and/or number of nodes and you are in the Stage III area.  This has to make a difference in survival rates (as well as scaring the beejabbers out of a lot of women who are reclassified as Stage III). AI's, Herceptin,  Tykerb, and the taxane chemos were not available a few years ago and now they are making a huge difference in survival. New therapies are being discovered all the time.",

Have your doc test you for hypothyroidism. If you are hypothyroid, you can get Synthroid which will make a huge difference in your energy level. - Sleep apnea. Progesterone and estrogen protect us before menopause, but afterwards, we are vulnerable, especially those of us who are ER/PR+ and on Tamoxifen or AIs. Do you snore loud enough to warrant comparisons to a freight train or grizzly bear? Does your bed partner tell you that you stop breathing and gasp/snort for breath during the night? Sleep apnea keeps you from getting refreshing sleep at night and you feel sleep-deprived and fatigued during the day. Ask for a sleep test. ",
