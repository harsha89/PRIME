    "Content": "KRT32 wrote: About a week and a half ago, I felt some extreme itching in my left breast, went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror and noticed what appeared to be like 5 red, swollen bug bites right around the bottom right hand side of my Areola. As the days progressed I \u201cthought\u201d it was getting better because it wasn\u2019t as red, but the redness has just spread out now to a bigger area, like the size of my thumb around the outside rim of my Areola in the spot I mentioned above. The appearance is red and welty, but all one spot and not several different spots anymore. Still extremely itchy, but no pain. I am 27 and currently breastfeeding a 4 month old. I have a request in to see my GP next week, just waiting for a day and time. I also have some pretty bad shoulder blade pain on that side, but I\u2019ve been experiencing that for about 8 months now with no answers. I\u2019m definitely scared. Especially with a 4 month old and a 3 year old. Im having a hard time eating, sleeping, and just being in a pleasant mood due to me always being so worried. *sighs* Log in to post a reply",
