I am sure part of the decision to do a more complete job was to save you having to have two procedures - one for diagnosis, and then possibly one for complete removal. I suspect there will be a pathologist nearby who will examine the tissue and guide the surgeon to get clear margins, or if it turns out to be a lymph node, they will decide where else to check. At times like this it is maybe better to have smaller breasts. Another thought, if it does turn out to be a lymph node, they would rather remove it, rather than disturb it. At any rate, xanax or a mild sedative during this time might allow you to rest when you need to.",

I laid on the table, they placed me in the right position with arms over the head. They inflated the pad under me and it became my mold. They did the two small tats on the sides, measured and marked the middle, put tape over that one, then they took me for the CAT scan which is done without contrast, so it is done with you lying on a table with a semi circular band going over you. Painless, and not tight or claustrophobic. Then it is finished. They did the middle tat after my first treatment. Again, just a small dot and painless. The treatments have been short and tolerable. The biggest part for me is the daily schedule and the driving. My skin turned a little pink the second day. Gma Foley from this board told me it wouldn't necessarily get worse, and so far so good.

LindaJanette, thank you for starting the new thread.  I will definitely go over there.  I am with you girls.  I need to take off 25 lbs., and not put any weight on!! ",
