They gave me IV steroids and benadryl, said i was allergic to a anti/nausea mmed next week went for hydration IV, 2 minutes into it, saline solution only.......i passed out big time. I jsut remember getting light headed, calling the nurse.  And i woke up with every staff member surrounding me, the oncology doc, and ambulance paramedics husband saw the whole thing, throat swell up, doctor slapping my wrist, yelling wake up....so they sent me in ambulance overnight...checked everything out. said to get offa my BP med Benicar...so that was that then they my port flipped, did it in arm, with a diff, wipe for port, not numbing spray, lined tubing differant, etc....no reaction went for 3rd chemo, this week. felt light headed, called the nurse, voice got scratchy, and got hives, oh yea the last 2 ewpisodes i got hives....the one wehre i passed out i got hives bad, lost my  voice even so we postponed till next wednesday, were going to do it in my arm again,but after sitting there 3 hours, i needed a break. They did give me 50 mg oral benadryl, and a steroid shot Of course this is baffling, but they said it's happened to patients before sometiems. Anyuone have any experience with this?  Tks Log in to post a reply",
