My bi-lateral was done in 2013 and I had numerous lymph nodes removed only on the left side.  I always mentioned to my husband the tearing, burning sensation under my arm and numbness under my forearm (Maybe nerve damage).  I thought this was normal. I was living with the pain but it's seems to be getting worse. Now I am wondering since I have found out about these clip and wondering if the clips had been causing the pains all this time. It comes and goes.  I have a titanium bolt for my BAHA with little problems.  I am going to have to set up an appointment with BS to find out.  Surgeon and Doctors don't explain anything to you. You have to get your records and research for yourself. You wonder if you can find that special surgeon or doctor who has compassion for their work who cares for their patient.  Anyone found a surgeon who will remove these clips or what we can do without taking pain medication?  Between kidney stone, heart problems (doctor determined to put a pacemaker in) and this, it's a wonder a person doesn't get discourage with this life.",
