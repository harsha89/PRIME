I'm older than you (43), but after finding a small lump near my nipple that had started pulling it inward I was referred to mammogram and ultrasound that showed nothing. The Radiologist told me I was good and to come back in a year for my annual check. I wasn't satisfied SO Iwent to see a surgeon who said \"it's not supposed to be there so let's remove it\". 2 weeks later I found out that I had a very aggressive breast cancer. Trust your gut.
