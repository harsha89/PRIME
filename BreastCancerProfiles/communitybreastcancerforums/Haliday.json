It is not the radiation, per se methinks, but the pressure of the 1 hour drive each way coupled with the treatments ON TOP of work that, if I don\u2019t do, it doesn\u2019t get done. Prioritizing has never been more important. It all feels real to me and I pride myself on being a \u201cnever sick, never tired\u201d kind of person, a pride I am reluctantly letting go of Sleep is my favorite drug. . .and then we will see what happens when I start the Arimidex in June (I know, a different thread) Restful Sunday to all\u2014I plan to stay in my sticky-topped, greasy jammies all day.",

Could have just been hunger (or looking at my phone in the car). Positioning takes longer than I expected. . .I am glad they are perfectionists about millimeters but my hands fell asleep yesterday. I hope this goes a little more quickly for my arms\u2019 sakes!",

Started slathering Eucerin already with plans for thrice daily when treatment starts. I practiced the breath holding at my simulation. Will keep you informed of progress and side effects. Here we go!
