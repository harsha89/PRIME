You are doing the exact right thing by following up with a breast surgeon. Good luck!",

If your breasts are fibrocystic then they can really pop up anytime however they are more frequent in youth. I had my first at 26 and had subsequent ones show up in my thirties and one in my forties so not very unusual. Go with your gut when it comes to follow up. If your worried go see the breast specialist and put your mind at ease. That's what they're there for! Good luck!",

I think there is a big difference between cause and effect. Does this cause the breast cancer or does it effect the growth of a cancer that was pre-determined to be there anyway or does it not? The absorption of hormone systemically with Mirena is very low. Nothing compared to the birth control pill.  Same thought goes for the birth control pills. Cause or effect? There are probably many more women in this world who have taken birth control pills who don't end up with breast cancer than do. I think we all want to find out a \"cause\" for our cancer but just because you had a Mirena placed right before you were diagnosed doesn't mean it \"caused\" the cancer. Did it contribute? Maybe, maybe not. I think the jury is still way out on this and causes are probably going to remain more complicated. I have to ponder this as well because I have daughter who has the Mirena and I have other daughters on the pill but I don't want to jump to any conclusions. Just have to watch the science.",

When my PS released the sutures it had not healed so over the next six weeks I had to just let it heal from the inside out. Healed beautifully and had my exchange. Than two weeks later for no reason, the top layer of it decided to peel like a blister. Had to let it re-heal again and again it has healed beautifully. My question to you is are you sure your looking at puss or are you looking at the the white milky covering that you will sometimes see when the skin is regenerating? It sounds to me like it may be the latter. When a wound is healing open it produces a whiteish substance that is actually part of the healing process. If there aren't other symptoms of a localized infection like increased redness, soreness, streaks etc. it prob isn't infected and is just healing. It won't scab either. It will just eventually fill in with fresh tissue. It might help you to google wound healing and you can get info from that. Healing open just takes patience and it does take weeks.",
