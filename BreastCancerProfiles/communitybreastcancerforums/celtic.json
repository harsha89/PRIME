I dont know where you are but since you have insurance call a\" Breast Surgeon \" in your city and get seen. The surgeon is the best person to feel it and if need be do a biopsy . It may be just an ingrown hair that is infected which does swell with fluid and drain so the lump does down.... but you want to know. keep us updated, best to you. Christine",

Call them and get an appointment, the treatment is first quality at a fraction of the price and they also accept insurance if you should have any. They will also be able to advise and monitor any medications that you are on or need to take for the dental procedures. The peace of mind part,  is that you are at the hospital  and they have access to all meds and doctors :o) Good luck and remember you have to treat you well. It's about loving ourselves and putting us first finally. (((((  hugs )))) Christine",

Hope this helps.... of course make sure they put on the fan and you get ear plugs. Will be thinking of you in June.",

By the time I had the third treatment of AC we did MRI's and saw that the tumor had shrunk by 33 to 50 % !! I was excited since it makes for a clear margin when surgery is done. We did the fourth round of AC and then scheduled surgery. My best to you.**  I was able to feel that the tumor was getting smaller.",
