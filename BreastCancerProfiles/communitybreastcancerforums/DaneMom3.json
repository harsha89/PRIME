I have been having my mammograms annually as prescribed and for the first 2 1/2 years all was fine. I am now 44 and am more than a little concerned. I just got a call from my OBGYN's office with the results of last week's annual mammo. For the second time in just over a year I need to have a repeat done at an imaging center followed by an ultra sound. This happened about a year ago as well. I then had to go every 6 months for evaluations and all was clear? The concern is asymmetry and density? Apparently I have really dense breast tissue. I have always had fairly large breasts and have been athletic, not sure if this makes any difference tho. I guess my concern is that I have read there is an increased risk of breast cancer in women who have denser tissue? Help, any advice or information would be greatly appreciated...I don't want to go crazy getting mis-info from the web. Thank you all in advance! <3 Log in to post a reply",
