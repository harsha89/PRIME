Not sure about the other things that are stated on the reports (which I'll put at the end of this post). I also know that the sclerosing adenosis mimicks invasive breast cancer on mammograms and the only way to differentiate between the two is biopsy. I do also have dense breasts plus both grandmothers had cancer/mastectomy. My thoughts and questions revolve around being told to get another mammogram in 6 months. If this condition mimics breast cancer on mammos-I don't see the use in mammography every 6 months. I have no plan on getting biopsies every 6 months if something shows. The mammography itself can't differentiate. I don't plan on filling my life with looking for cancer. I'd rather have a better equipped test less often than a insufficient one more often. I'd have more faith in that to act on the results. Basically, is there something I gain from mammograms more often? I wish I knew what percentage of chance there was that a mammogram would catch an actual cancer in my case. Honestly I'm thinking that once a year is plenty with all things considered. I know I have an increased cancer risk but is 6 month mammos the wisest approach? I've never once had MRI mentioned to me. I don't know if there are any other options. (I've had u/s and it didn't show anything other than well defined 'nodules'. Thanks for listening to my rant. If you have any opinions on what I talked about or what some of the fibrocystic changes listed on my bx report are, or experiences relating, comment away! Procedure: Digital Diagnostic Left Breast Mammogram   History: History of abnormal mammogram, abnormal calcifications   Five views were obtained. CAD images were obtained. The exam is compared with prior studies. The left breast is heterogeneously dense. Again are numerous pleomorphic calcifications upper outer aspect of the left breast. Some of these calcifications are felt to be indeterminate in nature. These are grouped together at the upper outer aspect of the left breast.   Impression: Indeterminate Calcifications Upper Outer Aspect of The Left Breast.   Recommendation: Further Evaluation Of The Left Breast With Stereotactic Guided Biopsy Is Recommended.   BIRADS Classification: Category 4A, Suspicious.   Surgical Pathology Report   Final Pathologic Diagnosis: Left breast, upper outer calcifications, mammotome biopsy: Benign fibrocystic change showing sclerosing adenosis, cystically dilated ducts, columnar cell change, and benign intraductal microcalcifications.   Gross Description: The specimen is labeled left upper outer breast calcium biopsy. Submitted as #1 and labeled \"with microcalcifications\" are six biopsies ranging in size from 0.4 up to 3.5 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm. Submitted as #2 are ten biopsies ranging in size from 0.3 up to 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm.   Cold Ischemia Time:                                  2 minutes Neutral Buffered Formalin Fixation Time:     10 hours, 8 minutes ~Sheryl Log in to post a reply",

And then these reports have pretty much everything I'm aware of in the breast. There is probably a little more in previous 'screening' mammograms because I know they also checked another spot in another area of the left breast when they did my ultrasound 8ish months ago but they never said anything else about that so I assume that was determined to not be suspicious. I've pretty much decided to just go back in a year. I was just wanting to make sure I wasn't missing something so thouight I'd put it out here for opinions. Thank you!",

Just wanted to let you know that you're not alone on the 'I hope I get through with gut issues' front. I have Crohn's and am hoping for a good gut day when the test is done! I also have spine arthritis and a two-level fusion in my neck so am hoping I will be able to get off the table when it's over. :) I will be thinking of you and sending good gut vibes and hope you have good test results. I would let them know about the IBS before they start the test and maybe they will have suggestions/can work with you to help you be more comfortable with it. Sheryl",
