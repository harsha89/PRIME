My symptoms are so constant, not related to cycle, and do not change if i am happy/sad etc. I am trying to believe that it is not cancer as i have had all the imaging, and have no clinical presentation... but it must be SOMETHING! Obviously it's hard for the doctors to diagnose as its just based on things i am \"feeling\" and nothing that they can see or feel. i had to push for all tests so far(and pay for them myself) as the doctor said i didnt need any tests. But to have abnormal sensations in your body for months is very stressful and draining. I know no one on here can diagnose me, but just need to get my feelings out a bit! Thanks for listening! ",
