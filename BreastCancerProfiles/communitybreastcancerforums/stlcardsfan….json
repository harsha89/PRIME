PS's seem to all have different opinions. It seems the use of an underwire bra is mentioned a lot for support of the implants while the area heals and scar tissue forms to keep the implants in place. Anyway - lots of good info on the bra thread  - FYI it is on the Breast reconstruction thread.",

Still on every 3 wk Herceptin and heard that can mess with how fast hair comes back. I am also taking the biotin everyday and that seems to be helping as well. It sure is making my leg hair grow quick! When should I start the mini trims? I have a few areas which seem poofy and longer than others, but not by much. I guess I am hesitant to cut to much off since I have been without hair for so long.  ",

I lost about 90% of my hair, head was buzzed to about 1/4 inch, the stubble that was left fell out over the next few days, and I also used duct tape to get rid of it. The ends were dead so it didn't hurt. It may sound weird to duct tape your head - but it worked, and is easier than using the lint roller that I started with. ",

I am at the point now that people probably think I cut or wear my hair this short on purpose. I am due to renew my drivers license in April, I sure hope my hair grows a little more before then. Brows/lashes - for me, the inner part of the brow hung on, but everything else fell out by the time chemo was done. I had surgery after chemo, and since I was home for 6 weeks didn't wear makeup the first few weeks home. When I did finally get prettied up, realized I didn't have very many long eyelashes left. But, instead a lot of very short new ones.  9 months out - eyelashes all back.",

It happened to me and I used a electric razor and shaved it off, after the third time it stopped growing. It is now back to what I had before everything fell out. I also stopped the Biotin when the facial fuzz started. I am back to taking Biotin to help my fingernails. I never had an issue thru Chemo, but within the last two months have noticed that they are dry, cracking and have ridges in them. Any one else dealing with this after Herceptin is done? It is interesting that it is only my thumb nails and pinkies that are affected. My toenails are all fine, and I did ice during taxotere. ",

Top not as curly.  I still don't do anything to it in the morning, just wash, condition and let it air dry. I kinda foof it up and let it do what it wants. With the humid weather that St. Louis has had a few times this year, I see even more foofyness. Approaching 1 year PFC. Top is 4 inches, sides about 3 1/2 inches.

I am back at work after 6/21 surgeries, and decided no more wig (aka hamster) just to hot, and my head is actually covered. I am fine around the house topless, but feel more comfortable with a cap on when I go out. So, going back to work, decided to wear ball caps - good price at Walmart $2.50 each and they have multiple colors. They are solid with no sayings or designs. Why do people feel the need to tell me that I really don't need to wear the caps. That my hair looks fine. I mean, what business is it of there's? I know that they are trying to make me feel better - but comments like that really don't help. Even my boss (he is a male) told me to bag the hat. I mean, he has more hair then me for crying out loud, and I told him that! Anyone got a good comeback for me?  I too have that lovely peach fuzz on my cheeks and forehead. I shaved once, but it came back. I guess I need to shave it again.  edited to add - removed the double post below - sorry about that. ",

Granted, not much happened the first 3 weeks as the Chemo was still in my body. At about 5 to 6 weeks I noticed some stubble on the very top of my head. In June when I went in for surgery, my whole head was covered with very short stubble. I went back to work in August wearing a baseball cap. In mid-Sept no more cap, and have been topless ever since. Hope this helps. The hair on top of my head is growing faster than the sides and back. The front part by forehead is growing the slowest. My bangs are about 2 inches long.

Since I did chemo first - it was gone in Jan 2010. When I went out for surgery in June 2010 as still wearing a wig to work but ditching it as soon as I walked out of the building. In August when I went back to work, wore a baseball cap. My head was covered but it was still very short. By Sept - the cap was off, and I have been topless ever since. I am at the point now were it looks like I cut my hair this short on purpose. And of course there are the random pieces that stick up every which way. I still haven't had a trim - that is probably going to start in Feb. I just have a hard time going in and getting a haircut or trim when I hardly have any hair to begin with.

Plus, I am after all a baseball fan! Christine47 - I did the same thing. About 4 to 5 weeks after my last Chemo I figured maybe something would be up there. I would look every day very carefully for evidence of regrowth. I mean, the more you check the faster it grows right?!   What started first was sparse, and then the stubble popped thru. I could tell immediately the difference when I would rub my head. I to wanted something up there when I went in for my surgery. I wore my pink STL Cards ball cap up until they wheeled me in to the OR. They had the cap ready in the recovery room. I wore it as they wheeled me to my room for the night. My work ID badge shows me with long shoulder length hair. Daily reminder of what I used to look like. But, quite a few people at work have commented on how much they like my shorter do - I am of course, growing it out back to how it was.  ",

I was given the option of doing myself, or driving in the next day to have them do it. I chose to try it myself. It really wasn't that bad. It is a very small needle, and I did it in the stomach - lots of cushion there . The nurses on my first chemo day showed me how to do it, and had me practice on a round ball. I had given my dog allergy shots every 20 days for 3 years so it didn't seem like a big deal to me. The trick that they told me was to inject slowly so it would not burn.  Also should note that some dr's don't automatically give the Neulasta shot (due to the cost), and tend to do a wait and see how people react to chemo, blood levels and all. My dr gave it automatically, and based on how my levels tracked, very glad he did. I consider myself very healthy and active, but chemo sure does a number on your body. The actual administering of the chemo drugs is painless, especially if you have a port. The se's usually start a few days later, and vary widely from person to person.  It also helps to have a good thermometer at home. Important to keep track of your temperature during the early part of each chemo cycle. I also kept a daily journal of se's. Just a notebook that I wrote things down it. Brought it with me to each appt to refer back to when dr asked me how I was doing.  Sorry, I will stop now, didn't mean to hijack the thread. I just like to help. ",

It hit me after round #2, and onc put me on OTC Prilosec until about 3 weeks after my last Chemo. Stomach bloat was also very common on this one, and seemed to be gone by about 7 to 8 days after each cycle. As odd as it sounds, some form of exercise actually does help with the fatigue. I would walk inside on a treadmill at a slow pace. If you are giving yourself the Neulasta shot - I was told to inject very slowly so that it doesn't burn. It also should be warmed up to room temp before injecting - package says about 1/2 hour.  The most critical days for TCH were days 7 to 10 of each cycle, that is when body immune system is at an all time low. If someone was coughing or appeared to be sick around me, I headed the other way. Similar timeframe for the other every 3wk chemo combos.  Good luck to all those starting this week!",

FYI on the steroids - they are part of the pre-meds to prevent nausea. I was on decadron - they gave it in IV form on day of Chemo, and then I took for 3 days after if pill form. I for one did not gain any weight on this chemo. Nor did I lose. Just wanted to mention that steroids are part of treatment due to the nature of chemo and really help on the nausea front. Definitely talk with your doctors if you really don't want them. Overal TCH is very doable - just make sure to ice your fingernails and toenailss when they give you the taxotere. Will prevent you from losing them or getting the discolored nails. I did, and all my finger and toe nails made it thru chemo just fine. Didn't lose any of them. The oncology nurses gave me ziploc baggies full of ice chips. My DH helped keep them on my toes for the 1 hour infusion. Hope this helps and good luck! ",

They are 100% and very nice. website is www.franceluxe.com. click on the \"good wishes\" toward top of page when website comes up to read more about program. I got one and it is very nice. Unfortunately, as I had no hair during the winter, it just wasn't warm enough and so I didn't wear it. Free to the first person who pm's me. It is 100% silk Batik silk print design, mainly pink in color. Check it out and let me know if you are interested. If this color isn't your thing, then definitely check out website as there are many others to chose from.  To add on to Liz's comments. Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash. I used it all thru chemo (3 times a day) - no mouth problems. Colgate sells a super soft toothbrush that I used all thru chemo. I just made sure to dry it out between uses. Also, nasal spray if nose starts to get dry, and to prevent nose bleeds. But, since it is so humid out, this probably won't be a problem for many!  ",

It helps you sleep as drowsiness is one of the side effects. Dissolve under your tongue for faster results. This is one of the anti nausea drugs too, but has duel purposes. Water - I drank at least 8 cups of liquid each day, all thru chemo. So, that was 18 weeks. I alternated between water, skim milk and gaterade diluted with water so it wasn't so sweet. Make sure to get the Emla cream for the port, and put on at least 1 hour before the poke. I never felt the poke, and still don't. That cream really works!  Neulasta shot - gave this to myself. It is a very small needle, and hardly hurt. I was not about to drive 35 minutes to get it, takes all of 15 - 20 seconds.   And just a friendly reminder, if you had lymph nodes removed, don't let them measure blood pressure on that arm. If nodes gone from both sides, then request a thigh measure. It is what I do! ",

Everytime the Port is accessed like for blood draws, etc, the first tube of blodd or sometimes the first two are disgarded. Has the heparin in it. Before the port needle is removed - like when chemo is done - you should be getting a saline flush followed by a heparin flush. The heparin stays in the port and prevents it from clotting. The tubing that you are feeling near collar bone is completely normal. For most it goes over the collar bone and into a vein in the neck. Yikes is what I thought when I heard that. Hope that helps!",

Should be gone in a few more days. It was the worst after the first one, and then not so bad for the next 5. Lack of energy - there is your Fatigue. For me after # 1, it hit on days 4 to 5. By day 10, felt pretty good. This combo never gave me nausea, it is on the milder side in that aspect, unless one has a very weak stomach.  As young mom mentioned, duck tape really does work for the loose hairs after the shave. My hairdresser did the 1/4 \" buzz. Looked like the Demi Moore style from GI Jane. Then over the next few days, the majority of that stubble fell out, or came out via duck tape. My scalp was not 100% hair free. There was about 10% hair coverage, and what was left did actually grow all thru Chemo. Once the real hair started to grow after Chemo, then this remaining fuzz was cut off. On the TCH regimen, day 18 was shave head day for me. It was falling out in clumps. Eyebrows and eyelashes hung on until #5. Good thing was no shaving of the legs or underarms for about 4 months! Always look for the positive. I never heard if anyone wanted the headwrap that I have. Also be sure to check out the website if that style is something to your liking.  www.franceluxe.com  Click on the \"Good Wishes\" link.  Will continue to read and post to help all of you as much as possible. Have the most knowledge of TCH of which I was on. Still on the H till Jan 2011. You guys will be fine! Onward and upward back to health! ",

They get a little worse, and happen a little earlier with each treatment. But, for me, ended earlier too. What I found to be helpful is jot down each day how I felt, etc, and then used that for comparsion during each cycle. By # 3 , I knew what to expect and for about how long. It helps to with the Chemo brain. for early shavers, when the stubble starts to go, duct tape or lint rollers work well. After a few days it is done. For some, myself included, I had about 5% hair left, and that grew thru treatment. Once chemo was done, and real hair started to grow, I cut the fuzz was cut off. The first few days after each Chemo cycle are most critical - ie when most of that stuff leaves the body. so hand washing, flushing toilet, etc very important. Hope this helps!",

For those on TCH chemo - T = taxotere, C = carboplatin and H= Herceptin - I can answer questions related to that, as that I what I had. there is also a TCH thread that has been going for over 2 years, lots of good info there. jsw19 - get the Port. With the amount of Herceptin, it makes it so much easier. And it can be used for the frequent blood draws and saves the arms. Tips - Emla cream for port - numbs the area and you don't feel the needle go it. Drink water/liquids - as much as you can, and then drink some more. Very helpful to get the stuff out of your body after each treatment. Eat small meals throughout the day, helps keep something in the stomach. Don't be surprised if you get chemo induced heartburn - it does happen. Happened to me. there are lots of meds to help with nausea. If something doesn't work, tell dr, and get something else. Neulasta shot is not a big deal. I injected myself after each Chemo and had no problems. Some have mentioned that Clartin helps with the se's from this also. And remember - while Chemo is not something we want to do - it is something we can do to beat the  nasty BC, and that is the ultimate goal!!! Here to help in anyway that I can. Feel free to pm with any questions. ",

Things I have learned that may be of some help. Never got a cami for the drains, just wasn't worth if for the 2 weeks or so that it would be needed. Instead, used some white surgical tape to create tabs on the drain tubes. One tab pinned to sports bra, and the other tab pinned to inside of button front shirt. Worked great. Panty hose used to hold up drains when in shower. I looped thru the bulb tabs and then hung around my neck. Took another panty hose and tied around my waist so that the tubes were not dangling to much. Walmart sells awesome sports bras for not much money. A pack of 3 for $10. The cup area is big enough to hold the chest area firmly, but not to tight. I was told to get them about 2 inches more than what I normally wore pre-surgery. The brand is Fruit of the Loom and they are front hook. The elastic is also covered in fabric so it does not rub on the skin. They can go in the wash as well. Rather than get poofies - sanitary napkins work to fill the cup area, and they are cheap. I have plenty since I am now in surgical menopause.   A little bit of lotion on the fingers makes it very easy to milk the drains. Your fingers just slight down.  Good luck to everyone still waiting, and good healing to all those who are done. ",
