    "Content": "May 2, 2018 05:03AM - edited May 2, 2018 05:07AM by Patartist Hello Everyone, I have an AC question. I had 12 taxol to start with, and now completed 2 of 4 DD ACs. The Taxols wereno fun but I'm finding the ACs much harder. This time, 4 days after the infusion, my heart was beating so hard I could count my pulse just lying on the couch listening to it. And my heartrate was (for me) fast, at 70 rather than in the 50's. I called my MO nurse and was told to just wait it out. It is better, now a few days further out. But I'm worried about my next dose. Did this happen to any of you? I was hoping for a repeat echocardiogram. Did any of you get one and was it useful? Thanks",
