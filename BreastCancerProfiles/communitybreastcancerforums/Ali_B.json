My story -- on Weds 8-12 I woke up with a terrible, localized pain in my left breast, around 5 o'clock, just below nipple.  It seemed like I felt a small lump (breasts are lumpy, maybe I imagined it?) Yesterday I called my gyne, who got me in with a nurse practioner a couple of hours later.  By that time the red spot had grown. NP said probably an infection.  I am 47, pre-menopausal, and haven't nursed in like 17 years so I understood the statistics.  She gave an \"immediate\" referral to a breast diagnostic imaging center, because their office doesn't do U/S.  I had to \"push\" her to get an rx for an antibiotic, but had done my research and knew I needed to treat or rule out infection for this red, growing, excruciating spot.  Very interesting, this breast diagnostic center let you pay $50 to meet with a radiologist and get an immediate diagnosis so I agreed to that rather than play the waiting game. Thur afternoon I had U/S, mammo and rad consult.  The Radiologist felt very certain that it was an infection, not IBS.  However, from the way she responded to my questions, I wasn't sure she had SEEN that many cases.  For example, she said my entire breast would be red, not that half-dollar (still growing) spot.  She made other comments that didn't sound completely accurate. HOWEVER, she was rather concerned about calcification in a different part of my breast.  I saw the mammo film.  From my untrained eye, it looked like maybe thin rods, stacked on each other, EXTREMELY white and bright, and a pretty large area, easily 3 or 4 cm. So, she is pulling my last mammo film from Nov '08 to compare.  I can tell you I was shocked by the size and density of this calcification. I have an appt with my physician on Weds 8-19, unless I hear from this diagnostic center sooner.  (It is their standard practice for lumps -- examined by NP, RAD and now MD.) So now I wait...
