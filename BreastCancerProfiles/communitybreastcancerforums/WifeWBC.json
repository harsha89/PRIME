    "Content": "Jan 19, 2018 02:44AM - edited Jan 19, 2018 02:49AM by WifeWBC I am no expert, but what the OP describes sounds an awful lot like De quervains tenosynovitus. Trapping of the nerve in the wrist bone area. Extremely painful, but often temporary (few weeks). Perhaps exacerbated by swelling in arm and in particular the wrist. Not sure how the two would be treated together. Assume the swelling has to be reduced. If arthritis is chronic, then the trapped or bruised nerve might be chronic too. Worth looking up. Old thread",
