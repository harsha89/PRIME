My sister was diagnosed with innumerable brain mets (largest about 1 cm) in Jan 07.  Her original diagnosis was April 06 with bone mets (also innumerable) from the start.  She is Her2+++ and ER-/PR- (although it appears that the cancer morphed to ER+/PR- after neoadjuvant chemotherapy of TCH + Zometa).  It also appears that her cancer forms in sheets, not clumps. In January and February of 07, she did 20 rounds of WBR.  Following radiation, she started on Xeloda and Tykerb.  So she is now about 11 months past the initial brain mets diagnosis and she is really doing very well.  There are no lasting effects from WBR or the brain mets.  Her brain MRIs continue to show at least stable and probably continued improvement.  It took some time for her hair to grow back but by the end of summer she was no longer wearing scarves or hats.  It did grow back in kind of a strange pattern but now completely covers her head. She has four children (5, 6, 10 and 14) and she has been able to care for them throughout.  I remember how scary the original brain mets diagnosis was.  But, really, almost a year past, and it seems much more manageable.  She REALLY is quite well.  There are several studies indicating both Xeloda and Tykerb are able to cross the Blood/Brain Barrier.  Please feel free to contact me via PM if you have any questions.  I read the board but do not post often.  Best of luck to you for continued healing and hope.  Amy",
