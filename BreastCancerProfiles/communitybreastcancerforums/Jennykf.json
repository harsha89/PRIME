I am in search of shoes she can wear - as for the sores in the mouth - she is actually taking certain vitamins for them, which unlike the mouthwash has actually made the sores go away rather then just help them not feel so bad...I will get the name of them and let you know ( they were prescribed to her by a Hollistic Oncologist that she sees along with her regular Oncologist)",
