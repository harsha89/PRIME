Any of u guys had any experience with IT topotecan? ive read about a lot of women on xeloda but i dont think moms neuro onc is in favor of it as the only form of treatment for the LMD (even tho my mom previously went into remission when she was on xeloda) my moms been fighting this crappy disease since 1989 and it keeps coming back to haunt us :(",
