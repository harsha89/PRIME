I haven't had the (dis)pleasure of the \"it's your fault you have cancer because you haven't taken Jesus Christ as your savior\" warped version of Christianity. I have been hit by the scorn of the spiritual-but-not-religious former friend. She was a big believer of positive thinking. Of note: --\"I am a true believer in the mind body connection.\" \"I don't believe in Western medicine.\" \"Some people are not evolved enough (and wise like me) to see the truth.\" Etc... Is it wrong to feel insulted when western medicine is keeping me alive? Is it wrong for me to scoff at her evolved wisdom when she needs my help moving her canned cat food from her kitchen because she is \"allergic\" to \"feathered creatures\"? Thankfully she had another friend remove her down pillows. --When I mentioned that I found comfort in these boards, she was horrified. \"You shouldn't be dwelling in all that negativity!\" Talk about missing the point. --When she asked with a smile if I was cured, I told her the truth. The medicine is working for now and that is good, but someday it will fail and I worry sometimes about what form that failure will take. \"Oh.\" By mutual decision, my friend and I have parted ways. She seemed to believe I was wallowing in grief and perpetuating my own illness. My other friends seem to be amazed at my general cheerfulness, go figure. My form of positivity includes not burying my head in the sand. It makes me feel better to have a better understanding of what may come. The form of positivity that her \"spirituality\" advises is just false. I refuse.",

I have just started on the path of trying to help myself with the depression, finally getting on anti-depressants and seeing a therapist.  Don't have much advice on that since I am at the beginning of that journey.  I have been stage IV  for almost two years now.  There have been both physical and emotional ups and downs during that time.  I can tell you that when I am physically facing challanges, starting a new medicine, having tests, facing surgery, I usually can emotionally rally to get into the fighting mindset.  My lowest emotional times have been when I get good reports of no progression strangely enough.  I get in the whats the point, there is nothing but an inevitable decline for me...sob, cry.  Hopefully the therapist will be able to help me with that.  The point being,  this disease sucks.  It sucks when things are going bad, It sucks when things are going well. When things are in transition, it makes things even harder. Being depressed about it is natural.  Focus on something positive every day even if it is hard.  I know it will be hard being a visitor for a week but focus on the fact that your friend is there for you to help you transition. Sounds like a keeper.  I wish you all the best. Susan",

I was 39 as well, a few days from my 40th birthday.  I have been on hormonals exclusively in that time, first tamoxifen, which only worked for a few months and then I had my ovaries removed around Thanksgiving 2010 and have been on Arimedex ever since.  I wanted to let you know that hormonals can be very effective.  I had a pretty large tumor, over 5cm.  My most recent scans show a reduction of about 90%.   I was advised by my oncologist brother to visuallize the battle at stage IV as a marathon rather than a sprint.   I always think that Stage IV is upside down from the earlier stages. In earlier stages you suffer through the most aggressive treatment that you can stand and then it is over and you are a survivor. A sprint.  In stage IV, the doctors in general seem to start with the least toxic treatments (hormonals when you are er+) and then move towards to the chemos after the hormonals fail. You start out with the survival stage, living your life as best as you can with the cancer hopefully as far in the background as you can get it.  It is really, really hard, especially at first but you WILL find your way. You should talk to your doctor(s) more about the mascetomy and reconstruction to see what they have to say.  My doctor wanted to keep the primary tumor in order to have a better barameter in terms of how the cancer is reacting to the medicine.  I agreed and am happy with the decision to avoid that surgery.  I consider it my early warning system and it gives me a sence of security.  I know that alot of people feel the opposite and want to purge all of the cancer from their body.  It is a personal decision. I agree with the above post to question your doctor about all of their treatment recommendations and get a second opinion if possible. I wish you all the best. Susan",

Scan if there are any changes to either symptoms or tumor markers.  My markers did rise on the one time that there was progression.  My markers are currently holding steady at 12-13 for over a year.  I have no symptoms.  I see my oncologist every three months and she feels me up, primary tumor, nodes and liver.  I am bone only and the cancer barely shows up on the scans at all anyways.   It is odd because everybody here does get scans regularly.  My last scan was in November of 2010!  At this point I am comfortable with the no scan decision but I do ask her every three months when I see her.  I do not feel that my doctor is unresponsive.  I know if I e-mail and tell her that I have some unusual pain or fatique she would schedule a scan the next day.",
