Did you use something like a sunburn Solarcaine? Did your doc approve the 5% lidocaine cream? Were you able to put it on both your nipples and your chest area? Can you buy this OTC? Some else mentioned a Menthol Gel, any brand name suggestions? Of course it would have to be odor free too. Thanks.",
