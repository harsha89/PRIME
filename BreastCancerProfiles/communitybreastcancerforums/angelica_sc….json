I've been trying to stay busy (or asleep) but it's hard to focus when you're wondering about your future. I'm about halfway out of my mind worried about these blotches, hoping they'll fade again during my evening nap, and praying that the results come soon, with good news. I just can't imagine what else this could be. ",

      "Content": "Nov 2, 2018 01:04PM - edited Nov 2, 2018 01:04PM by angelica_schuyler Happy to report that the punch biopsy came back benign, but wondering if I should have more testing done. The pain/heaviness/discomfort under my left armpit is unnerving. I also have been having night sweats and armpit odor on the affected side, which some folks on the board had as symptoms of cancer. I also read on here that IBC can be extremely hard to diagnose. I'm concerned that perhaps multiple punch biopsies should have been done to test a wider area, or that should have another ultrasound or an MRI to specficially look for IBC. My symptoms haven't changed. Should I be satisified with my results or push for more certainty? Thanks for reading and any help you can provide. ",
