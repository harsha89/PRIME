      "Content": "Jan 10, 2013 04:16AM Elcee54 wrote: Hi Everyone, I started chemo on Nov 13th but just found this forum.  I was diagnosed with ER+, PR-, HER2- ILC and took letrazole to postpone surgery until after my daughter's wedding in August.  I had a second mastectomy (first 14 years ago for extensive DCIS) and bi-lateral expanders in early September.  When my brother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year, I did a lot of research and have been working with a nutritional consulting group, Nutritional Solutions, on diet and supplements.  They base all of their recommendations on research, your blood work, your cancer, your therapies.  The amount of material they send is a bit overwhelming (I couldn't look at it for days), but their consults are amazing and I've been able to incorporate many things over time.  I ate well to begin with, but have made major changes in my diet to make sure  that it is anti-cancer: anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenisis, no sugar of any kind, no white flours, mostly organic, no processed foods, just a bit of organic chicken, high in protein since chemo can waste your muscles (I use a high quality whey powder that I add to my morning hot oat bran with ground flax and blueberries).  I wasn't sure how my onc would feel about my taking supplements, but I do take Vit D (high doses), omega 3, zinc, selenium, l-glutamine, astragulus (a Chinese herb - my decision - onc doesn't like herbs), and a great product called Greens First (15 fruits and veggies and many other super foods and probiotics in a tasty green drink).  She didn't want me to take Vit C and E since they are highly anti-oxidant and the research on anti-oxidants and chemo suggests problems.  These nutritionists have a slightly different take on it, but I decided to try to get more food-based vitamin C and E and forgo the supplements.  (I would never, never take supplements on my own without being under the care of qualified nutritionist who has lots of experience with cancer patients -there's too much you can do to really hurt yourself) I also see an acupunturist once a week and he alternates between a stomach treatment (I dont' have a great stomach and have some acid reflux) and an energy treatment.  He is starting me on high doses of Acetyl l-Carnitine to try to help avoid neuropathy.  I try to walk every day and do gentle workouts with a trainer once or twice a week for balance, strength and stability.  I'm also in  great place mentally, which also helps - my theme song is \"Put on a Happy Face\" for those mornings when I just want to cry and so I sing it at the top of my lungs in front of the mirror, dancing (my kids think I'm nuts), watch funny movies and laugh a lot with my girls.  I also see a great therapist. So why the long story?  I have already had four rounds of AC with a shot of Neulastim a day after each and aside from being more tired, having chemo brain (but less when I get more sleep) and losing most of my hair (I live overseas and have never heard of Cold Caps) I have had no side effects.  I do take Prilosec twice a day for my acid reflux but have had no nausea (well just a bit but an acupuncture needle in my ear did away with that) or other stomach problems, no pain except for a bit of back pain with the Neulastim which didn't need pain meds, some early attempts at mouth sores that I helped to ward off with salt water and brushing after every meal and an herbal mouth rinse that my acupunturist gave me. I work with three oncologists and all are amazed at how I'm doing but none want to read the nutritional materials I have.  Too bad, I'm convinced that everything I'm doing (plus I'm sure some good genes) are really helping me. I just started my four rounds of mega Taxol this week and yesterday when my hands got red, swollen and the skin was painful in places and rough I decided that finding a forum and looking for others who have had this issue might be good for me. And for me to share what's gone right with me.  I'm very nervous about getting permanent neuropathy - I think that's been my biggest worry all along.  And I pray that this isn't starting to happen after my first Taxol treatment.  The onc said if it happened it probably would start after the third treatment and that they might have to put me on a different form of Taxol which causes a more dramatic hair loss (just learned in this forum that it could be permanent!) would like to know what others are doing to avoid this problem. Good luck to everyone and what you are all going through.  I have not been able to closely follow all of the threads on the 50 pages, but I can see that we are all just trying to cope with the situations we find ourselves in, offering support and advice and there is nothing more important than knowing you are not alone. For those trying to cope alone (I'm also divorced but my kids are young adults), I found the Lotsa Helping Hands website very useful.  I have friends who accompany me to chemo in shifts (some take a few hours off of work once a month or so), friends that walk with me, friends who cook for me.  My kids are terrific but it's just too much for them to do everything.  Rally  your friends to help  you.  This website let's you organize everything! Blessings to all,  Elcee",
