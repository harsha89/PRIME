At the time of my surgery, the tumor board drs. discovered calcifications in my left breast.  In hindsight, I could possibly be looking at a recurrence of BC so I feel I made the right decision for me.  It is a personal decision and one that you have to be comfortable with.  Good luck with your decision.",
