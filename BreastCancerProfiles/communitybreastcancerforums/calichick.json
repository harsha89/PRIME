I couldn't remove it so that I don't bother the steri strips. I will try again with another hot shower. It's like duct tape! Thanks again...",

I am still sore...had my biopsy on Thursday...unfortunately I gave them a challenge...my calcification clusters were deep in the tissue and my boobs were way too thin to handle so it was a bit difficult having to put some rings on me to thicken up my boobs to do the procedure. Nonetheless, it got done...the staff was awesome and i am just contemplating on how to remove these bandages when they look like they've been stuck on with crazy glue? And I don't want to removed the steri strips along with it. Has anyone else experienced this? How did you guys remove the bandage without squirming? Any help appreciated! Thanks!
