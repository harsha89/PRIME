I am trying to keep my mind off of it, to watch movies and just breathe.  I don't feel good from having surgery yesterday, and all my mind can think of is how let down I feel by everyone in my life for walking out the second day.  It's just, I feel in my mind I should just be grateful they were there yesterday...but I'm not.  I'm upset. Sorry for the rant...just am glad there are people on here to listen.  Thanks to everyone on here for all the kind words you've already given me, and I'm praying for you guys, too.

Hope you're going to get some sleep today, Anne.  I'm with you on the exhaustion!  Even though the meds make me groggy, if I do sleep it's not seeming to be \"Good\" sleep...restless. ",
