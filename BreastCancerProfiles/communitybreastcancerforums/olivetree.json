    "Content": "olivetree wrote: Hi everyone, I'm writing to share a close family members recent experience as this forum helped me a lot over the past two months when I have been worrying and researching constantly. I told myself that if we received good news I would share it on here and not be one of those people that disappears suddenly. My family member discovered a 1.6cm lump in her breast one day, which was palpable. The doctors reassured her that it was probably nothing but she was scheduled to have an ultrasound just in case (she is very young so a mammogram would not have been very effective.) The results of that came back as concerning due to the shape/surface area of the lump, which promoted them to do a core needle biopsy. The results from that came back as normal. What concerned the doctors at that point was that the findings from the ultrasound and biopsy were discordant, so they scheduled her in for an excisional biopsy where they removed the lump and surrounding tissue. Four pathologists then failed to diagnose what the lump was, saying that it was suspicious but that they could not rule out/confirm cancer. Eventually an expert pathologist diagnosed the cells as being sclerosing adenosis, uncommon in women her age and very difficult to diagnose due the extreme similarity between it and cancer cells under a microscope. We feel incredibly grateful and lucky. She is scheduled to have a breast MRI in a few months to check the scar tissue after her operation. I wanted to share our story and hope that it might bring peace to someone who is in a similar situation - at every stage of diagnosis it seemed as though it was going to be the news we had feared most, but this was largely due to the long process/difficulty in diagnosing her benign condition. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps. XXXXXX Log in to post a reply",
