Moisterize moisterize etc. X 10.  I use very thick creams like aquaphor and put inspector gloves on my hands and socks on my feet.  you can order the gloves on the net, about 8 dollars a dozen.. They can be washed every day. At the beginning hand and foot issues shouldn't surface but probably will later on. I play professionally as an organist/pianist and have maintained my hands over 13 cycles.  they are a bit stiffened as the skin tightens and swells a bit.  I soak my feet about 2 X a month and rub off all the accumulating dead skin.. and then moisterize times 10. I've needed lots of rest.. at least an extra hour day, and a daily nap has been a godsend for me.  I take fish oil for joint aches and a pain med.. hydrocodone.  I try to take as little as possible but find that days 10 to 14 a bit challenging and now am up to the maximum dosage.  My onc. offered my stronger meds but i declined.. i'll save them for later. i try to eat extra protein.. my appetite has been fairly low and food just doesn't taste all that good.  not bad, just not good.  if i were to skip a meal, i wouldn't notice.  AFter my last few days i have to indulge in a bit of binge and stock back up.  My weight has been stable. about the gloves.. i like the nylon because they don't shrink and stay white when you wash them.. (in the laundry with hot water and bleach.. the cotton work for a while, and then need to be thrown away.  I use silk gloves when i play the piano.... kind of pricey tho at 8 bucks a pair and have to be hand washed. http://www.grainger.com/Grainger/inspection-gloves/hand-protection/safety/ecatalog/N-b1m",

All the cards are making me much more hopeful that I'll accomplish quite a few more things.. and my kids are absolutely blown away that I've gotten so many.. I don't cater much to the finesse of manners and thank you cards, but have always responded to gifts.. i am my mother's daughter.   I might have to remove yet another boob, if my brain can stand it.. that will bum my husband out altho i have no idea why he likes the remaining one at the moment.  I should have let him nurse when he asked. it's kind of a bummer to acknowledge that i need housecleaning help.  i already yell at my kids enough.. they have plenty of work to do.  i don't want to rob them or their childhood by making them slave away or instilling good work habits or ethics. (they do have daily chores and help me on fun projects)  I still am making money because son # 2 drives me to my jobs for which i pay him a percentage.  getting a paycheck is such a nice thing.  My husband lets me partially own his company for being the office.. it's not that there is any cash in that transaction. well one shouldn't talk about money in polite company. peace and love, apple - .....

I don't go 'out' to often but had wonderful tickets to an opera, to which I went alone.  I got out of my car, and my beautiful wool hat was ripped off my head along with the scarf ... it went flying down the street at 35 miles per hour.. No way could I catch it so i went to the opera bald.  One of the coolest experiments ever.  I got free tickets for the rest of the season.. (bought anonymously) .. people let me cut in line.. praised me for my bravery.. I wouldn't do it again on purpose, but being bald is not all that bad and really only lasts for a while.  facing baldness again in a week or two.. sigh. The American Cancer society offers some for free.. ask at you onc's office for some local links.",

      "Content": "Dec 17, 2011 05:44AM - edited Dec 18, 2011 04:35AM by apple Very interesting post and past Mary (I am a Mary too).  My son wants to be a fireman - He says 'how does a doctorate in literature compare with the opportunity to actually save a life'?  that must have been awesome to have been so impactful with your 'patients' .. to get them to where they life can be saved, to actually save them. I remember when i had my major seizure.  it was quite a doozy and there was a woman in the ambulance who kept asking me questions without a smile on her face.. She was focused, demanding and relentless in her quest to keep me conscious.  She asked me my name, She asked me what year it was.. She asked me the names of my children.. I struggled to answer correctly.. She asked me who the 23rd president of the United States was.. I remember sitting up and saying .. the 23rd?  the 23rd?  who would know that except some bitch of a paramedic?\"  She then laughed. .. I laughed too.. I can't believe I was so rude. (it's Benjamin Harrison btw.. the least known president in the history of the US).  I have thought a lot about her.. what it must be like to work in the middle of a nite in a mini hospital, flying down the streets with the sirens blaring, the adrenaline, the triumphs and loss.  I have suggested to my son that he investigate being a paramedic.. but he has fire on his mind and is into body building, strength, etc., and has said no thanks. I'm quite impressed with your choice of a master's thesis.  You've had a life filled with a broad scope of experience.  I knew a family who had come from Vietnam... I cooked with the women.. They were actually royalty of a sort, but had plenty of awful stories of death, unfairness and dying. I certainly have had my fair share of family tragedy (3 of my siblings have cancer) 3 of my inlaws have died of cancer,  I have a brain damaged brother, a brother that committed suicide after schizophrenia and a Down's syndrome brother in law.  Life really is unfair for some.. they just don't have the chance to be comfortable and happy and that just rankles me something awful (falling into old Kansas vernacular). You'll most likely live well beyond 5 years.  After being here for a while, it seems so many, even with fiercely oppressive mets are 'doing well' and enjoying life in whatever manner they can grasp. For me, bringing happiness and help into other people's lives has been the way I've been able to be happy... music volunteering etc.  You seem so competent tho.. I can imagine a 'happiness clinic' for the challenged run by you... or something like that.. maybe a visiting visitor (a fairy of happiness (like Mary Poppins) who has a list of those needing cheer... funded by someone like Ellen DeGeneris.. she certainly seems the generous sort).  Want me to write her for ya?  We could all sign our names. I am soooo fortunate to have had my 3 kids and I'm sorry you don't have that opportunity.. However,  a nice little doggie sure would be fun to have around.. to train, to cuddle with and walk.  Maybe you have a dog... anyway, just a pet for companionship and motivation could bring a little happiness. I sure wish you the best.  That was a very important post to read for me.  I am in the midst of quitting my long term accompanist job.  I started my group, directed them. grew them, played for them.. It's a volunteer job - I make my music money elsewhere, but the cost of my meds means i really need to use my Sundays wisely.... I could be makeing 200 bucks rather than nothing and have a LOT more time for other projects.. it's really a no brainer but so hard for me to leave my friends and the certain joy I get from making great church music.  I tried to quit in November, have turned down 2 job offers (I had sent out resumes) but agreed to stay till Christmas.  I hired my awesome director.. and the church pays her.. (kind of grossly unfair, but hay).. She was a seargent in the military, has a doctorate in choral conducting and is a 6 foot, amazon type, Northern European, blond beauty.. (think Darryl Hannah at age 55)..   she is a commandant.. heh... (i certainly don't mean heil)  and has become sort of something like a best friend, altho being friendly is really not part of her persona. good luck Mary. chin up.  maybe your life will be different as it goes on, .... you can still be happy.

I've lost 13 pounds in just 3 weeks and i have an onc. visit tomorrow.  So i sat on the sofa.. my son works at a bbq joint and brought me some ribs.. i rarely eat those, but ate them all then a huge bowl of Greek yogurt with very intense raspberry jam i made last year and froze.. yes froze.  absolutely delish... I am thinking of having some toast with butter, or half and avacado with salt.    I could eat toast with butter and avacado.. that would be a pound i bet, all in all.  I still am not skinny but don't even want to go there. every day lately it takes me an hour to eat a small bowl of cheerios.. i drink veggie and fruit juices, almond milk, a couple bites of dinner when people are watching and that's it.  and a beer for the extra 100 calories LOL. i should write a poem about eating on ativan i could eat fish in a can, on a divan i could eat eggs in a pan, perhaps some bran, i could eat fish from the Sea of Japan all in the plan because of ativan.   i could do this once a week and get some rest at the same time.. it's a win peace and love, apple - .....

My daughter is now totally in charge of decorating and she loves it.  I don't.. it's too much trouble altho i do put up a bit of sparkle by wrapping the unfinished columns with a tinselly garland and make red and green desserts.  Last Christmas I did really well in the gift department.  I thought it would be my last Christmas and wanted to make it a bit special.  I think I am going to start shopping.   We primarily shop at garage sales and I found great stuff last year.  too bad I can't drive.",

I give them this look like 'touch me again and I'll punch you'.  Fortunately my closest associate (director) senses this completely and I think is like that herself.  Unfortunately one of my singers totally does not get this and is always coming up to me and practically seems like she wants to smell me.  Finally, I just told her.. Alice....!  I have immunity issues and am supposed to maintain at least a 24 inch circle of privacy.. She looked at me like I was nuts but now doesn't come so close.  She's a real dear tho.  So, I've felt kind of bad.  Anyhoo...I really appreciate that you took the initiave to contact her sister Judie.  Thank you so much.  .  She has a person to tell.. should something bad happen.  I prefer to just kind of retreat if I am sick.  My husband does not understand this part of me/myself but well, I'll let him slide cause he is such a nice guy.   I don't know how many times I have told him 'no.......... I really don't want my feet rubbed at this time'.  Maybe later. ",

June i think you will be fine.. i work with a flautist.   surgery will not make your ribcage or lung capacity smaller and you will be able to lift your arms just fine.  you might have a rough year.... but you'll get thru it...   i would certainly plan on continuing to play professionally.  music has been an absolute godsend to me.. a very positive force.  I have continued to improve at the same rate and I haven't missed a single note as a working pianist, except for immediately after my surgery.  Chemo didn't affect my playing altho sometimes i felt a bit poorly. I am also a springboard diver and coach.  Diving requires that the arms be fully extended above the head with flexibility past the vertical.  I only had one side done and have diligently concentrated on physical therapy.  It took me about 6 months for me to be able to stretch my arms past my head.  I am very pleased with my 'scar' and did not have reconstructive surgery.  I have resumed diving and plan to compete again.  (Masters). ",

(i'm hoping for you). i would not be a bit surprised if i do lose at least a few by the time I'm done.. oh yeah - keep your nails VERY short. (off to lubricate mine before i retire). one thing i do if my fingertips get injured is wrap them with strips of coban (an excellent stretchy bandage).. you can make little fingertip covers that way.  you could probably ask a chemonurse to give you a sample of the end of the rolls which they throw away.  (it comes in many colors).  i can play with my fingertips totally bandaged  - they a real functional.. the tips kind of come off because they don't adhere to the skin, but you just put them back on.  i start with a strip vertically,  about 1/2 inch down from the top of the finger, them make a bend at the top and wrap and stretch about a 3 inch by 1/2 inch strip.. it will self adhere.  i'm sure that is clear as mud.  i will take a picture when i find my camera which is probably lost in mr. apple's work truck.",

Pain?  I found out my sister might have almost bungled this job for me...I know the cantor (Ann) who sings at this church kind of.  She sang at my dad's funeral about 5 years ago and I've heard her sing a LOT.. she's great.   When my mom died, I mentioned that we could have Ann sing for the funeral.. We were undecided because my mom hadn't even died yet.   My sister went ahead and called Ann and asked her to play and gave the songs that she chose. My mom had already chosen songs, a priest and a cantor and left instructions in an envelope.  (that's my mom heh).   I think my sister then called up  Ann (I don't really  know what she said -  but I know she said something super negative... I'll find out later).  and I think she told Ann that I didn't like her singing and had chosen someone else to sing..  Ann sent me an email saying she hoped that there were no hard feelings between us and she was sorry, and that she hoped we could still work together in spite of my feelings.. it's all fishy.   I am really interested to see what she is sorry for.  I'm thinking my sister told her that I had said that I didn't think she was any good or something like that to cover up the fact that she asked her to sing and my family had already gotten someone else.. it's confusing to me presently. nice sis .. huh?  - my sis has ALWAYS been a bit bonkers. peace and love, apple Diagnosis: 5/10/2008, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 4/9 nodes, ER+, HER2+",

She treats all patients and 'owns' many stage 4 bc patients.. She cried when I asked her about ones she has lost so I sense that she loves us.   she said.. \"losing someone to this disease is my biggest sorrow\". It makes me nervous that she is so pleasantly surprised when my results are good.. she really is so excited with good scans. suggesting, that an ongoing 'questioning' relationship is a worthy goal. ",

There was one word on every heart.. something to the effect of 'You are my everything'.  I wasn't offended but i was laughing so hard... and he was so hurt.  He is so miserly it's funny... you know, Go out and buy gift already.   He is generous with the poor tho at Christmas time and I admire that. My brother once bought me a purple rug.. very cheap and large enough to be UGLY.  hopefully I lost it in the move, but I may have to put it somewhere and put wet boots on it.",

My name is Mary Stevermer.  I'm 52.  In May of '08 I was diagnosed.  I found a tumor in my left breast.  It was really quite large.. almost 5 cm.  They scheduled me for immediate chemo.. 4 rounds of the red stuff and 4 rounds of another, whose name escapes me at present.  I breezed thru chemo and heard that I responded remarkably.  I knew my cancer was fairly advanced at the recognized onset and have never asked to see my actual diagnosis.  I should be about IIIc.  After chemo I had a radical modified mastectomy.  I didn't ask about.  My surgeon is great.  He asked me if I wanted to see pictures of what it would look like and I said no.  He was surprised but went along with my wishes.  He came to visit me after the surgery to take a look.  The hospital conveniently had a little makeup mirror in the food tray device.  He took off the bandages and I was a little surprised to the incision that went from the breast bone up into my armpit.  He did a fantastic  job.  .. even with staples it looked excellent,.  I remember shopping the day after my surgery for groceries. I ran into my nurse friend who couldn't believe I was out.  I told her my arms were intact.  anyway, except for the pesky drains, I had no problems.  I am now almost finished with the 30 rounds of radiation.  Recently, my surgeon found that my supraclavicular node was hard -  biopsied it and found that it was cancerous.. and I then found a lymph node in my right armpit the following week.  I suppose I'll be moving on into the stage IV forum.  Tomorrow I have a petscan  - hopefully they will find where the cancer has mestasticized.  I'm nervous but glad that we are aggresively pursuing this demon.. Perhaps later this week I will ask for my formal diagnosis. I'm a working pianist.. I play at church,.. I have a choir/ensemble and have joined forces with a fantastic director..I also teach, play for competitions as an accompanist and also for ballet classes.  I haven't skipped a beat, literally.  I hope I am able to continue to play for a long time.  I have 3 wonderful kids, ages 9, 11, and 14, and a great husband and extended families.  I'm am well supported and generally cheerful.. Here's a pic of me when I was just bald. my hair is returning slowly.. I imagine I will lose it soon again.  Y'all are a great source of inspiration to me.  I am really glad to know you all are here.  I've cried at your stories and danced with your joys. Here's to a New Year. peace and love, apple - ..... Mary Magdalen Dx 4/10/2008, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 4/9 nodes, mets, ER+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Interesting you should mention denial Sherri...  i think that sometimes i'm in denial.  I refused particularly to read about side effects and suffered none.  however, after perusing the forum I realize I had quite a few.  I'm kind of retarded or compulsive about focusing on what i choose to focus on.  Since this summer it's been Rachmaninoff's Corelli Variations.   Housework be dammed.  (A gorgeous piece if anyone is into classical).  Have a listen to the opening theme at You Tube. http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=GC6xtbUQWiQ",

I just want to let the doctor's worry about it, do my best thru treatment - learn piano literature, take care of my family and prepare for their future.  I will ask her when I see her..I promise.  I'm surprised that you all know your diagnoses so thoroughly.  My surgeon has plenty of Dr. Downer in his communications with me so it's not like i don't have a clue. I am fortunate to be in a large metro (Kansas City) and I seem to attend a well thought of cancer center. ",

I am a pianist organist at a big church(St. Jo's Shawnee) and a St Peregrine's statue is one of the lovely things I got from parishioners... I should be fully cured, I've had so many novenas, Masses and prayers offered up. Lisa, the meningiomas have sprung up since this last May and one is fairly sizeable, appearing to cover the top corner of my forehead.  It's rapid growth and encroachment that shifts the brain makes them think it is not benign tho they mentioned they thought it should be.   the onc and radiologist guess however, that the surgeon can remove it totally.  They said they very rarely see this type of thing.. and it hasn't been biopsied.  the surgeon is working me in this week, so it's all a bit rushed.  After Tuesday, I will know how the mr. brain surgeon will proceed. about the nodes.. they too sprung up during treatment.  they originally planned for me to do a hormonal but will chemo the system instead.  my poor doctors (radiation and oncologist) were really quite upset.. appearing together to discuss my future with me.  kind of chilling, but they are both such dears. thank you so much for the warm welcome.  I'm so glad to there are others who face similar huge challenges.. we still haven't told our kids and I suppose the next few days will be hectic.",

It's been good for me.  Do check out the big Xeloda thread.  We have lots of fun while we complain.  I think the first thing to do is figure out how to take it so it does not cause an upset tummy.  I personally find i can just eat 30 minutes before taking it.  I often eat a bit of breakfast.. take the big X, then eat a bit more..  i have never had any discomfort altho some women do get nauseaus.  I eat whatever i serve for dinner and Cheerios for breakfast.  Altho, the hand and feet issues take a few cycles to surface it is never too late to start slathering on creams (aquaphor rocks, but just about every serious cream does) and wearing inspector gloves (nylon, sold by the dozen for 8 bucks on the internets) to bed to keep your hands nice and soft.  Some people try the fancy schmancy aloe gloves and socks from Kohl's... i am on a budget. so my husband tells me.  best of luck.",

Prepare for a nice  rush, not really sugary.. just nice.  There are many minerals.. it always works for me.  I had bad cramping on Femara.. so much that i kept a bottle in my car. I drink it in hot milk, coffee or water or swig it straight.. pretty delish. from wiki: \" The third boiling of the sugar syrup makes blackstrap molasses. The majority of sucrose from the original juice has been crystallized and removed. The calorie content of blackstrap molasses is still mostly from the small remaining sugar content.[2] However, unlike refined sugars, it contains trace amounts of vitamins and significant amounts of several minerals. Blackstrap molasses is a source of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and iron; one tablespoon provides up to 20% of the daily value of each of those nutrients.[3][4] Blackstrap, often sold as a health supplement, is also used in the manufacture of cattle feed and for other industrial uses.\" Does anyone remember burning magnesium in chemistry (high school) class? edit:  you might not want to swig it on an empty stomach particularly if you are sugar sensitive.",

      "Content": "Sep 22, 2011 09:21AM - edited Sep 22, 2011 09:25AM by apple I hope posting in this forum helps for you.  There are many kind, caring helpful women (and men) here for each other.  My heart goes out to you.  Even tho I am doing 'well'.... I am so in love with my daughter - age 12 and it breaks my heart that she might lose me well before age 21.  As Agada said, you are stronger than you think.  .. and I agree with the possibility of exploring anti depressants.   Being under pressure is really hard on you... and an antidepressant can make one so much more efficient and able to work.   I'm really sorry you are out of school and not doing the things your friends are doing.. that sucks.  Being with your mom is so important tho.  I don't think I would want my daughter to leave school but then, I don't live in another country.  I find these days with my children very rewarding and wonderful.  They are respectful, helpful and loving, knowing that i may not be with them.  Your mother must appreciate you so much. Be sure to take care of yourself, eating lots of apples and other fruits.  Sometimes a little fruit sugar is just the thing to get one out of the doldrums of depression.  Not eating can be particularly stressful as it affects one's blood sugar levels for some.  I do best myself with a fairly even schedule of eating, work and rest. I am amazed that you are the responsible one.   warm wishes to you and your mother.  Please stay in touch and feel free to pm me.  As to God.. well, let's hope he (she?) gives you strength.  I am religious and non religious.  I was born Catholic and am very involved in the music ministry.. Yet, if I were Jewish or of another religion I would be comfortable.  I think God transcends our categories and is of help in even bad times.   Sending love and prayers and wishes of support from your community. ",

We spent days, editting, starting over, writing outlines.  We had to stop because he would get emotional and he wouldn't to project peace and happiness.  If I had the opportunity to help someone again I would bow out and suggest hiring a professional who knows how to do such a thing.   since then I have talked with people who have that sort of business.. they record and create memories, legacies.  You may consider doing that.  In spite of the difficulties, those tapes are the treasured favorite possessions of his daughters.  I marvel how they watch them and are able to laugh and that we even had the foresight to include ways to make them laugh. i wish you peace on your journey and pray for you and your family.",

After all, if your onc. doesn't have an opinion that she is willing to share... eek. that would scare me.  On the other hand, SHE brought it up so maybe she has an opinion but doesn't want to be 'blamed' if it is not helpful. There are so many women here who thoroughly research and are so great in explaining things. you could post your question in other forums.. like the 'chemotherapy forum'.  Personally my uneducated guess would be to go with the words 'curative intent'.. that sounds good... very hopeful.   Even if a complete cure were not achieved, you still could have a very good result.  i.e.  there is a spectrum of result that may or may not include a cure.  To me it is interesting that the onc. proposed this.   chemo only lasts a bit of time and the result could help you last longer...

He absolutely adores the family tho.  He looks so funny now because we must shave him so closely  (and we are not very good at it) because of all the burrs we grow outside for him.   The beginning of burr season is hilarious.  His coat is usually about 2 or 3 inches long, and he'll come home literally covered with an armor of burrs.  by the time we cut that off he looks pathetic.  He appreciates that we help him tho.. i am his worst enemy.. he sees me coming with a scissors, brush and comb and slinks off.   hoping some real happiness returns to you Sheila.. depression is very hard to deal with.  Today is my be good to people who drive me bats day.  putting them all together on one day seems a little easier.",

My sis just had a baseball sized tumor removed from her liver that was benign.  Her surgeon feared the worst.  He privately told me to prepare myself, that she might not even make it thru surgery.

I could hardly swallow my neck nodes were so cancerized.  Femara works for many people but not me.  I so quickly resolved when I changed to Faslodex, which worked for a while. and now I am on Xeloda which seems to be working super... I hope that Kimberly rebounds quickly.. and good wishes for you who contemplate and support.  peace and love, apple / Mary Diagnosis: 4/10/2008, IDC, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 4/9 nodes, mets, ER+, HER2+",

I had gained 10 pounds.  I totally eliminated salt from my diet and it went down immediately.. my onc. also offered me a script for a diuretic but  I never filled it.  I read online that cranberry juice was quite excellent (with no salt on anything)  in ridding the body of extra water.  i drank that too.  I think water retention is a side effect of taxol.. obviously you / she has contacted the oncologist.  if it lasts another day or so, you definitely want to call the oncologist again, because that swelling can be bad for your heart to handle..

I never get horny.  I do love the warmth of my husband and would do anything for him and love him deeply tho.  I wish we could hire a concubine for my husband.. but he loves me deeply and could never even entertain the thought.. i would be so fine with the idea. I have found a few things.. there is a perfect amount of time between sex nites that lets him come rather quickly without going on forever..   I find if I get him horny for a few hours ahead of time he comes quicker.  I apologize for doing the sex duty thing.. i just don't have it in me to pretend to be the sex kitten.. we talk frankly and he understands and is grateful for what i do do for him.. (have sex at all). Do read the thread 'The solution to painful intercourse!!!!!!   right here in this forum.  Do feel free to further discuss.  Men think totally differently than we do... a frank discussion before you put on the wig and try to be what your husband wants may be in order.  I wouldn't be mad at him for just being a man.. believe me.. they never change, but seeing things from your perspective may help him.  I remember sitting down with my husband and telling i simply couldn't have sex daily.. it was stupid.. I am 55.  you think that sort of thing would kind of start dissipating. i sincerely wish you a resolution to your problem and send you big hugs. ",

It was emailed and facebooked immediately.  I was inundated with donations for house cleanings, casseroles and casseroles and cards..  My own mom was so cool with the information.  She calmly said she was sorry and carried on without undue sorrow.  I am prominent in my church community as THE musician and me dear pastor announced it from the pulpit!  egads.. I was sooo embarrassed. I am a pretty private person and was somewhat assaulted with the onslaught of sympathy but having been taught to be gracious, I was.  I have been blessed with great support.

I used peroxide.  REMI hair is gorgeous, not like mine, but very real looking.  i added streaks, and painted on degrees of lightness using both a paper towel (bounty) and a toothbrush.  kind of cool.  this link has some of the same styles.  (the roots will never show  because they don't grow). http://africanamericanwigs.net/shortstyles.aspx I also discovered WET AND WILD eyebrow kits. They are no longer available in store where i live, but at 3.99, I'm going to order a lifetime supply.  each kit lasts about 6 months.  http://www.nonpareilboutique.com/makeup--eyes--eyebrow-enhancers--wet-n-wild-ultimate-brow-kit.htmlt here are all sorts of ways to apply the eyebrow and it stays on, looks totally real as if you had hairs. I have both kits and make a blending of the colors.  They are kind of dark and take a bit of experimentation.  Unless i scrub the eyebrows stay on. I have hair now.. i feel the same, but it is so nice to appear healthy.  I really am bothered by the sympathy i see on people's faces.  eyebrows REALLY help one look normal and this next time I'm going to wear a wig in public.",

Melissa now has blond hair to her shoulders, and is doing well. We live very close to the school.. about a block away.  Sometimes I hear them pray for me  and others over the loud speaker in their morning prayers \"We'd like to pray for Mrs. N----- -, (Melissa), Mary  S-----------,  (me) Gene and Klara's mother, Giovanna M-------, Mikey and Patrick's mother, and Donna H---------, Michelle and Anna's mother.\" ....  we all have breast cancer.",

Fortunately, I am openminded and do serve them to my family... growing them and having cans.  I eat them too, but not with pleasure. i pretty much love all vegetables and really like celery, sauteed with potatoes and garlic in olive oil... letting everything get nice and crunchy brown before stirring. I parboil the potatoe slices first to use less oil.",

I am often surprised that my kids have no idea how the housework gets done.. i guess they think everything somehow magically goes back into place, clean, polished and orderly.  My kids are learning (i bribe them by giving them dollars) that putting away stuff really helps mom.  I guess I suggest  when you are visiting, to just straighten things up, sweep, do the dishes while you visit. .. just a few little things. Treatments after a while are  fatigue-ing and it is hard to keep up with all the work that maintaining a living space entails. Offer to take her to lunch.. establish a way to communicate daily.. just a few words, tell her you love her every time you leave.  If you can get pass the 'taboo', offer to rub her feet.. I tell you, nothing feels so good to me, altho my sons are absolutely horrified by the idea.  Bring her little things.. a rose, a sandwich, a bit of soup.. things like that,   Ask her if she needs anything from the store.  Altho I am still working and am really not impacted physically too much, the last thing i want to do, is go shopping in the cold weather.  Make sure she has a comfy place to rest.. a reading light, super soft blankies and nice pillow.. maybe near a tv. Like pq2 wrote.. the last thing I want is for my kids (ages 12 - 17) to give up anything in their lives.. I want them to be happy and do the things they are supposed to be doing as if their mom were not sick.  . I try my hardest to teach them how to be happy and to steel themselves for their upcoming grief. Best of luck to you.  Feel free to participate here.  Your mother herself could enjoy this forum.  There are many women from many different backgrounds and of different ages.  Does she live alone? Chances are good that treatments will work well, and she could live for many more years.  I used to think I'd be dead in a year, but years later, I'm still here and quite functional.",

I am a former smoker and remember running into a newly graduated md in the emergency room.  He was so quick to suggest that I had asthma or COPD during a visit.. i was in there for nothing related to breathing.  in fact, i think i had taken my son in for an ankle injury and had laughed when he asked my  then, 12 year old if he smoked.. and I volunteered that i didn't start smoking till i was 21.    he was such a newby.  i do not forgive her arrogance.  there is a way to discuss issues without judgement.. but also realize she was sharing frustrations with her peers who probably too shared her exasperation with  fixing something that didn't need to be broken in the first place. I don't really care to share the insurance pool i share with the nonresponsible but i do... and that's ok.  We're all human. The comments above have nothing to do with the causes of cancer and I'm sorry if they imply anything controversial.",

At the end of life, if this is what it is, I found that asking the parent what THEY wanted was important.  Surprisingly all of them wanted special things that we never thought of.  My dad wanted to visit with a colleague from the 60s, my mom had a funeral file with EVERYTHING outlined.. the songs, the readings, the presider, her dress.  (we vetoed her dress by the way... it had really deteriorated and she was much smaller.  my mother in law wanted perfume that she had always wanted.  Simple things to give them really.  A funny story.. my dad had been in a near coma for about 3 days.  I was holding his hands and telling him how much he meant to me.  He hadn't spoken for about a week.  Suddenly he opened his eyes and asked 'Do you have a car?\"... I said yes and he said 'Why don't you drive it home!\"  He had Alzheimers. .. very difficult he was, but I still loved him.  I don't know that now is the time for levity, but dying is very much a part of each of our lives and happy death  after a happy and fulfilling life is the most we can hope for. May peace be with you as you go through this sad time.    *still praying for a miracle\"",

If it grew rapidly or slowly is beside the point that it may have very likely contributed to other cancer cells proliferating... particularly since you mentioned the Paget's disease.    I myself am stage IV.. I certainly don't think from any fault of my own... my diet and lifestyle were great.  Do visit the alternative thread.. There is a whole section of this forum dedicated to those who eschew modern medicine totally and 'go natural or altenative'.  It is one thing to be proud of one's choices and another to 'claim victory' too soon.  I don't see anything wrong in extending a kind invitation to the alternative theads. Joy - isn't that a bit too much information .. to assume that an innocent question will me bet with a 'fight'.   anyway, if there is going to be one.. maybe it could be in the proper natural therapies area.  One doesn't usually see the post after post after post after post link thingy in this area.  .. and that's good.",

I think one the reasons for the isolation of us stage 4 gals is that our plight seems hopeless for those who face less advanced disease.  I know for myself, I am reluctant to offer anyone hope because I am an example of one without 'hope'.  Still my life is my own and very enjoyable and fulfilling at this point.   We face issues the early stage gals dream of and fear, and it is best to face the future with confidence and courage. When I was first diagnosed in '08, I received about 50 cards.  They really helped.  Now I am so used to my situation.  I receive cards and look at them with wonder.. 'Why would Betty (age 90) send me yet another card?\"  She is the only one that does wish me well tho, and she holds a special place in my heart for her thoughtfulness. One thing I would suggest is to perhaps focus on the later stage gals who face major issues.  Sometimes one needs a card shower.  I get the idea that you'd like to pair up gals with gals.  That is nice too.  It is very thoughtful of you.",

EGO contemno lemma.. something like that, and I don't really remember. .  I got to skip the dreaded peas that nite.  I was the oldest of 9 kids and my mom would open a can, put them in a pot and cook them for 20 minutes till they were grey... she'd give each of us a tiny spoonful.  We stuck them in our mouthes and swallowed them with milk.  ick. English incorporates words form the silk road, the pacific,  I find it fascinating.  I've made a little money as a English major.. writing for patent lawyers and grain publications.. I hated it.  Anyway, conspicuity is a wonderful word but we certainly don't want to hear it.  You should have seen what they said about my brain mets.. I'm not even going to share. Wishing the best for you Ann.... just trying to take your mind off your troubles",

As to coping.. well, I am going to try to get as much fulfillment, influence and enjoyment out of these years as I can.    maybe someone can help you clean your house so you can sit down and play cards or something with your kids.  time is important.  you know, you have to prepare them to cope with suffering.. while it is hard, it's pretty interesting.  Suffering is a part of life and tools to enable kids to cope are very valuable. and btw.. be hopeful!!! you could last many many years, even to see her graduate and give you a grandkid.. you never know.",

All of a sudden his room is NEAT.. books put away, clothes folded, the bed made and I can tell he is trying in school. He had his first tournament yesterday. I couldn't go. but he won 5 of 5.  All he said when he came home is that he did ok and wanted to eat.  Later his coach called and basically said.. \"OMG - your son is such a champ.  He doesn't even have wrestling shoes, is pretty fat for a wrestler and not only did he win every match but beat the senior state heavyweight champ in the back room.  I saw it.   The state champ apparently wanted to beat his butt and teach him a lesson. .. but no.  Gene pinned him like he was a butterfly and he's a freshman.. a freshman!!\" I have no idea how Gene learned to wrestle.  When he was born, his breast plate stood up, one side over the other.  The doctor said he probably would grow into himself and it would straighten out and probably it was an indication of a large upper body later on.  He is 14 and growing out of his size 14 shoes.  Why do i have to have this friggin cancer.. ?

She waved an apology and I waved back.. I remember this man looking at me with absolutely wide astonished eyes.  I thought I was pretty cool, driving like a racecar driver and not reacting under pressure.  I still say idiot. I absolutely hate it when when people ask me how I am.  I don';t like sympathy.. i usually feel fine.  i hate the heartfelt furrowed brow, and deep tearing eyes of the empathetic.. I don't like sharing medical info.  I don't like gossip.  I kind of left my church community over this.  I couldn't go anywhere without the 20 questions coming at me.  When I made my business cards a couple years back I made a little card that said I'm doing good\" I don't talk about my cancer EVER Nicely centered in Green, Bold, Garamond font #18 on a greyish background.. Word got around and  people really didn't bother me for a while.  It didn't last long tho in the long run, and I figured the card was a bit too attention getting because I got a LOT of casseroles.  that was nice.  I generally love people and the positive things they share.. it's just so darn embarrassing being the sick one.  I don't even feel sick.. it's just a pain in the arse... all the appointments and hairloss and stuff like that and I really don't like talking about it with the same ol' same ol' eyebrow raising people who take pride in their empathy and compassion.

Your mother probably has hers... getting her to be able to discuss them and project them may be difficult you might visit the 'Aging Parents Anonymous' thread.  there are many who face similar issues and you'll find support, comfort and LOTS of laughter there..  I'll try to create the link.. if it doesn't work you can copy/paste into your browser. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/79/topic/766411?page=7#idx_210 or go to the forum (from the index) Complementary and Holistic Medicine and Treatment:   and find the main thread there.",

Here is my original thread on this seizure.. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topic/767630?page=4#idx_116 I saw the neurosurgeon and here compared MRI slides and CT scans from 2008 and this last month and concluded the meningioma is growing very slowly.. just 2 cms in 2.5 years.. from 25 to 27 cms.. (maybe those are millimeters.. I am math challenged.. bigger than a flat walnut I think).  The concensus seems to be that it would be unwise to remove the meningioma at this time.. so no surgery. My brain is so damaged and my drugs are soooo strong.  I can't drive, everything is different..  Still I can still write and play the piano, and work... I am just soooooooooo loose and sloppy.. my thinking is a bit hallucinatory, not unpleasant and my eyes are a bit whacky.. things aren't exactly flat for instance..  my arms look floppy and fat.  I have never had fat arms. I am really enjoying writing and will compile the anecdotes and essays I've been storing in the computer for my kids, etc. I really have been fascinated by these mental changes and have been posting updates on facebook for friends and family.   My memory works in a different way now.   you can be my friend if you wish on facebook..

They work really well for me when I can't think of real English words.  - I know they can be irritating tho, and maybe I'll be fazing those abbreviations out as my brain improves.)  My brain is working pretty well, but for instance, the last 2 weeks are a bit of a blur.   I don't remember some things.. I do remember other things tho, like how to play music so I am looking forward to directing my mental recovery with things like practice.  I love that sort of thing.   People are being so nice.. sending food, taking me garage sale=ing and shopping.,  My onc. seems to think I am responding well to Xeloda.. altho I am very interested in trying to determine how Xeloda's methods of attacking cancer may have contributed to this seizure thing.

Still it is all very cool and I've already been exposed to the dregs of life. We've been doing botanical gardens, beaches, tidepools, aquariums, naval stuff. and the kids are having a blast.

We've been in SanDiego since early Monday.  2 growing huge boys 17 and 14, mr. apple, and me and the girlchild (12). I got to visit with my old roommates and best friends.. They basically are government / science interface of Scripps.. sooooooooooooooooooooo incredibly special.. and super super interesting.  I've gotten to spend some excellent time with them the air is so incredibly comfortable, cool, dry, warm, no pollens, clouds and sunshine every afternoon.  the kids were genuinely interested in maritime and military things (omg the air craft carrier), We absolutely adored the botanical gardens and tide pools.  so many cool plants... incredible bamboo and tree specimens.  It's been a chore logistically coordinating everyone and their caloric intakes.. (i could eat one bowl of oatmeal, a slice of cheese and a couple apples in a few days and be totally fine).. soooo this morning we are going to go pig out on steak and eggs or something like that and pop on the train and vegetate till early Monday.  I haven't had any steak in years and it sounds pretty good. The train was actually very comfortable and afforded great conversations and card games. .That was my report.  I hope you enjoyed it.  I'll be 'seeing' you soon.",

No one wants to do chemo.. no one.. but  am I ever grateful that it has worked for me.. I'd be long gone. As to the disservice... i think those who want to eschew chemo are early stage.  I think most people seriously facing this beast would rarely consider choosing to opt out.   I do cringe every time the subject appears.. For some reason, it really makes me feel bad, mostly because they are so proud to be cancer free.  It always doesn't work that way. So is it a problem..?  Perhaps.  I tend to think so, especially when misinformation is shared.  However, many of the alternative treatments I employ, and they can be helpful.  Eating healthily, exercising, taking some supplements are good to embrace.. Coffee enemas and 100 pills a day pushed by the silicone Barbie, \"napalm-grade stupid about cancer*  \"Suzanne S. ...  no thanks. As a non-newbie, I just don't engage in that discussion... (except for now).  I do wish the alternative - hate modern medicine gals would be less exuberant in their support of not embracing modern medicine and less enthusiastic about whatever cancer cure makes the news, researched or not. oh well.    There are controversial  threads that have been banned from appearing in the active topics list.  If it is a perceived problem - that could be an option. * hat tip to scienceblogs.com and 'Orac'  a brilliant yet funny, researcher, doctor, and  blogger..   peace.",
