I don't know what the surgeon will say about doing the immediate test, but I am going to request it. By the time they get around to doing the biopsy I will have all ready waited at least a month....nerves are running a lil thin. It is my understanding that they still send the specimen off, this test only lets them know what they r dealing with. Also, I haven't told my mom or my child and I would like to know asap in order to prepare them if need be. Good luck today!!!!!",

Mine is only suppose to take 2 working days, but I live n a smaller community...will have to travel about 30 miles to have it done. Gives us more time to pray about it! You can still keep in touch until then if u need someone to talk to. Hope u have a better night tonight and can get some rest! God Bless yaÂ ",

I do intend to request the test at the time of the biopsy and it is known as \"frozen section\" or \"cryosection\". Please keep me updated on how you are doing and what ur results are and I will do the same. God Bless",

I hope that the burning sensation has quit went away and u are cofortable now. What type of procedure did u have done? they are going to take me to the OR, give me goofy juice, take me to xray and put n some type of wires that will identify the section for the surgeon to biopsy...then take me back to the OR and put me under to do the surgery. I have told anyone n my home, but my husband, but sounds like I may have to spill the beans and wont be able to hide it. (We are n the same time zone...) Have a wonderful say Sis and take it easy!",

She said results will take 2 working days. I figure will be middle of the next week, so hurry up and wait some more. I believe with my whole heart in prayer and I was visiting a church this past weekend in another state and they prayed sooo good for me. Meant more to me than any Dr. visit could, cuz I believe the Lord is still in the healing business. What is the good word on your end? Please keep me updated also.",

I am suppose to know by Wed. Take good care!!",
