I was diagnosed over Labor Day with IDC on my left side. I am a 4th generation on my moms side with my mom and her 2 sisters being diagnosed in their 60's. I am however am 39 and a mom to 3 kids under the age of 9. This has been like a bad dream. My family is BRCA neg. just an odd family cluster. I feel blessed to be alive and they caught it early but I hate that I am going through this. I have been trying to stay positive but my healing has been going very slow. Live for them: I had the same surgery as you bi lat with direct to implant skin/nipple sparing. My pain was out of control. I still have 2 drains in 3.5 weeks post op. I too think the Tatas are ugly. My left side was really bruised and had a lot of blood pooling. The nipples have survived and my right is starting to look better, but my left developed necrotic tissue under the nipple. I might be having surgery on Wednesday to remove the dead tissue/ skin. I find that with the direct to implant the swelling and muscle contractions have been very bad. My new foobs feel like hard boulders that hurt. I now have nerves regenerating and that is not fun. This has been a long process that is not over. I know one day it will be and I will be able to enjoy the rest of my life. My docs are fabulous and I am humbled by the outpouring of encouragement I have received. I find that I have says that I am just sad. It's hard to look in the mirror and feel alien things in your body. I really want these last 2 drains out and want the hardness to ease up. But for now I know I'm not alone. But ppl who haven't gone through this don't understand what we feel. To those of you who haven't had surgery. Good luck and you will get though it! ",

But in all seriousness im happy you are doing well!! I will be officially 4 weeks post op tomorrow and my ps keeps putting off tidying up some necrosis which is good more and more skin keeps pinking up. My whole left breast peeled 2 days ago like a sunburn and wow it looks better all the gross skin came off. The last 2 drains are really awful. I can actually feel them through my clothes where they wrap up to the top of my breast and it's very painful since my nerves are alive and well there. Trying to stay strong all of you ladies make it possible, I was having a hard time tonight and knowing thT there are so many of rave strong women on here made it a little bit easier!",

As a result my blood had a hard time returning to the area under my nipple my doc said they call that area the triangle of death with our type of surgery. It looked awful, it looked blue/ purple then eventually turned grey and blackish ( starting necrosis) he had me wash and gently massage the skin to see if any of the skin came off he didn't want to excise it if he didn't have too. So it finally peeled and m large part of skin is now reduced to a quarter size which is good news!! Wherever you feel uncomfortable ask your doc why mine was great about explaining unfortunately for me 10cc is very low and I'm around 15 still so im still stuck with them. I go back tomorrow and Monday its my one thanksgiving wish!!",

Frill: sorry to hear about your experience, stay strong and positive! Live4them: It may sound weird but you might be able to release some fluid by massaging your breasts? Good luck! I too get very sore after during the day I felt good. My doc told me I was doing way to much, For those of you who are more recent out of surgery, stay ahead of the pain. I know my docs gave me more when I ran out. I also found that muscle relaxers helped more than the pain meds. It is still difficult to sleep at night! Wishing all of you a nice Thanksgiving no matter how you spend it, I know even though this diagnosis has not been easy for any of us, I have a lot to be Thankful for! But I will not be cooking!!",

My 2 year old says momma has 2 boo boos and pets me my 8 yr old was very curious looking at the drains etc and my 9 yr old says eww get away! But they have been wonderful to me.

Did your plastic surgeon offer to write a prescription for after your procedure for garments etc. we have a special store that I went to that got a prescription for me for 2 camis and 2 bras which all had pockets and came with breast pillows in case I only had TE. It was all covered. The brands were Amoena, gentle touch and ABC www.americanbreastcare.com. There are stores online that will except the prescriptions too. If you do go direct to implant order a size up to accommodate the swelling! Almost 4 weeks out my favorite bra is one my ps recommended I found on Amazon. It's from playtex called Zip zip hooray. I almost returned it before surgery b/c it was huge now it fits great, super soft. I too freaked out the day before, I just kept telling my self you will get through this, you will be alive. You will too! At least it's cold now and easier to hide our lovely drains! My ps told me I needed to name mine today since I've had them for so long!",

I too wish I had given my mom more support when she went through this! To all of you on this chat thank you for being brave and sharing your stories, for as much as my friends and family want to help, no one quite gets it the way we all do. Hugs and prayers to everyone as we continue to heal and get better!",

I see my ps tomorrow I am hoping the last drains come out and I am going to talk to him about the hardness. I coached a soccer game for my 8 yr old she plays travel and I couldn't wait to get home I feel like I was being dug into and tight. I'm having a hard time with the inner part by my sternum. I keep hearing it will get better so trying to hang in there. I'll also find out tomorrow if I need surgery on Wednesday to remove the dead skin.",
