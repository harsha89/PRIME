Immediately after surgery I would not have believed I would be feeling this good this soon. Thanks for all your thoughts! Garcias-I am sorry to hear your news! I have been through chemo and am willing to answer any questions you have about it. It is doable-not desirable-but doable. I ,an aged to work most days through it. I had a tougher time with the hair loss then I thought I would. The good this is once it's over you do stopp stressing about it. I wear my wifg to work and no one knows it is a wig. I bought it before I lost my hair to match color and style. Lots of people to say cut your hair short first but I didn't and my wig length is past my shoulders. Big hugs to you I know this is tough to swallow! CLC-bandage comes off today...not sure if I will look...ugh! I believe my 7yo daughter will want to look though! LOL To those of you coming up...the wait was the worse part for me.",

My onc said I would but will continue on with herceptin for twelve more treatments. I don't want to have it removed if I don't have to. Just curious. Thanks!",

I don't think I will mourn the loss of the breast but am anticipating looking horrific. So I guess anything short of that I will be pleasantly relieved, right??? I guess none of us know how we will feel until the time comes. You are wise to have a good idea in anticipation however. Often times our anticipation is more pessamistic than the reality, so let's hope that the outcome is not as bad as we are anticipating! Maria_Malta-I am there with you about feeling spaced out! I have this nervous-anxious energy that I am not sure what to do with. I want to do everything only to be immediately followed by wanting to do nothing!

So, now I will be faced with delayed recon and a uniboob until that time. If there is one thing I have learned it is that I am not in control of this and it does no good to have a plan. I keep telling myself that LIVING is what is important NOT how I look, scars, boobs, etc. Still struggling though!",
