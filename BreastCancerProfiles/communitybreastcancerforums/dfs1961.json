I am beyond thrilled and overjoyed. My husband, myself and my children were a nervous wreck. The breast surgeon was convinced it was IDC. My tumor is 3.4cm. The surgeon and I even talked about treatment, surgery dates, etc. I was already looking at wigs as he told me that chemo was unavoidable due to my age (42). I still need surgery to remove the lump. I will do it in November as day surgery. This ordeal has affected me in so many ways. I still can't believe that I don't have cancer. I won't believe it until the lump is removed and biopsied again. I went for a long walk today in the beautiful New England weather and kicked piles of leaves while listening to my music. God is good and I have wonderful angels watching over me.",
