    "Content": "crazypenguinsfan wrote: I had a mastectomy with SNB 7 weeks ago, everything has been great, lessening pain and swelling in the armpit until yesterday in the middle of the night. My family packed and I helped drive to SC. In the middle of night at hotel my armpit started to swell and get really really sore, it woke me up. I took ibuprofen all day yesterday to help deaden pain. Today I was feeling weird so I took my temperature and it is 101.5 F... I have a call into my doctor, but, just wondering if anyone has had a random virus and had their armpit swell like this? I have the typical fever symptoms, lethargy, generalized muscle pain, headache. Just wondering if because of the recent SNB that maybe my armpit nodes are all screwed up and will blow up in response to random infections? I am calling the doc just in case I have infection due to mastectomy since I did go swimming at YMCA for first time on Tuesday.... Just curious if anyone has experienced anything like this! And, it sucks to feel crummy on the first days of vacation :( I was so looking forward to this! Steph Steph Log in to post a reply",
