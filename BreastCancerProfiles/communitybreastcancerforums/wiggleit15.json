It could take a while for things to balance out. I've been dealing with breast pain that sounds very similar to yours (the burning up to the collarbone) for about seven months now and it started not long after I stopped breastfeeding. Even though I think my case might be related to hormones, I am still concerned and can understand where you are coming from. I'd recommend consulting with an OB-GYN and pushing for an ultrasound. I've had two and both showed a small nodule in the painful breast (benign looking) but i'm still under 6 month monitoring, which has eased my mind a bit. Breast pain is usually a sign of a benign process but not always so it is best to get checked!",

An ultrasound or MRI would probably be the additional testing that would be recommended. I know that I got a letter from the radiology place I went to saying that I have dense breasts and that some things can be missed (though it didn't say \"extremely\"). I think form letters are usually sent to women with dense breasts after a mammo but I guess it really depends on how the letter is worded. I agree--if you are in doubt, just call. Good luck!",

Also, have you mentioned that kidney pain to an internist? I'm not dismissing your breast issues because I have similar pain in my left breast but luckily the breast surgeon I saw is pushing for six month monitoring of a complex cyst so I feel ok waiting and pretty confident nothing crazy is going on. I do think that it is strange you are having that let down feeling in your breast. SInce nothing is showing up on scans, maybe give it another few months and if it continues consult about the breast again? Has the doctor who ordered the exams suggested anything? I've had a lot of similar symptoms to you and have run through a whole gamut of testing--endocrine, autoimmune, you name it. If you aren't feeling well then I think it is definitely worth it to continue trying to get answers. I agree with inks that some of your symptoms (the temperature disregulation, weight change, cravings) could be thyroid related but you won't know unless you test!",
