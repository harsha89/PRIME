I was diagnosed shortly after my annual mammogram in November with stage 0 DCIS. I had all my scans and biopsys done. I decided on a double mastectomy to reduce the risk of reoccurrence. When I went in for surgery Jan 28 they were shocked to find a 4 cm mass and 9/15 nodes positive. That was the worse day of my life. You go in stage 0 and come out stage 3. I have had my 4 rounds of AC and 2 out of 4 of Taxotere. Everyone keeps saying stay positive but that is so hard when you are getting your butt kicked by chemo. On top of it all I freak out at every ache and pain that the cancer has spread. I just keep praying everyday that this all works and I can watch my kids grow!",
