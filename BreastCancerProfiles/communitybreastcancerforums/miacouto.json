By that time TMs were low but since January they started to go up while she is on Femara. Her CA 15-3 is 120 and CEA was 8.75 and last blood test was 7.35 (went down a litle, hope?). Her onc ordered a PET scan which came back negative, so what's going on with her? I'm scared that Femara is not working but last CEA gave me some hope. Onc says if CA15-3 keeps going up he will put my mum on Xeloda even though PET is clear! I would like to hear your opinion on this....do you think TMs up could be tumor flare?? I wish...

My mom is on Xeloda since June 2012 ( 7 months now) and it's been stable, TMs have been in the 60's for months now and very. very slowly are coming down. Now onc says she should stop for a 2-3 month break. Do you think it's safe? Did any of you been in a similar situation? Her blood work is fine and she feels fine.

What I can say is that she lost weight ( 5 kgs so far) since she started the treatment (she has done 4 cycles so far) and SE are worst compared to xeloda. I'm not sure intravenous navelbine would be better but I could guess that it might be. There was a doctor that my mum consulted before she started oral navelbine, which was completely against this oral form because of the toxicity. She told my mother that her patients usually lost a lot of weight on that drug. Anyway, my mum decided to give it a try and I can't wait for it to be over. All the best for you.",
