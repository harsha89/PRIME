Her post was loaded with fascinating information! Your post prompted me to dig out a book I have titled \"The China Study.\" Based on what you've written I believe you may find it interesting. There is a companion documentary to it titled \"Forks over Knives.\" Another interesting documentary is \"The Ghost in Our Genes,\" it's by Nova and is available on youtube. I plan on re-watching it this weekend, I remember it being very compelling. There's always another side of the story and I've seen negative comments about The China Study, but nonetheless it is interesting. It's always a good to research the opposing opinion of any idea. Best wishes going out to everyone, the strength and positive outlook of people here are inspiring. This community has actually made me decide to live life a bit differently - do something good for my physical and mental health each day that I wouldn't have normally done. Even if it's as simple as trying to actually get those 9 servings of vegetables and fruit a day, having a smoothie, spending more time with our pets, passing on that last glass of wine I'd normally have, going for a walk and marveling at nature instead of being in a perpetual hurry, obsessing about a clean house, worrying about what other people think of me or being overly concerned about work! It snowed yesterday and last night and it's beautiful. I'm home from work, we live steps away from a stunning park so a walk is definitely in the cards today. Time to stop and smell the roses. Our dog will be thrilled!",
