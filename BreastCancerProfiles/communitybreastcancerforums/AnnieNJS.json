    "Content": "AnnieNJS wrote: Hi all. I had an MRI guided core biopsy on 11/25 and fortunately got benign results. Had lots of bleeding during the procedure and developed a 3cm hematoma which my BS called \"huge\". They say it will likely go away on its own but my BS says that if it doesn't he wants to remove it eventually. Have any of you developed a hematoma of this size? If so how long did it take to go away? If it did not go away did you have it removed ? Thank you in advance!! Log in to post a reply",
