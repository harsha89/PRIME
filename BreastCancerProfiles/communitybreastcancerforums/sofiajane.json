I also consulted with a PS in Chicago who would not do surgery. I know of the reputation of the NOLA surgeons but I never considered I would have nerves they could \"unbundle\". I will give them a call. Did your insurance give you any problem? Sofia",

      "Content": "Oct 18, 2010 09:59PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 05:58AM by sofiajane I have read this thread with interest and I think of all the amazing women who have to deal with cancer and then continued pain - I had my mastectomies and reconstruction from TE in 2007. It has been almost 4 years and my pain bio is identical to you. Only difference is that I cannot stand clothes on me. I cannot wear a bra and really suffer in the Ohio winter when I need heavier clothing. Maybe that difference is why I was diagnosed with RSD. Of course my breast surgeon thought I should go to an orthopedic doctor since I may have a disc problem! I drove home and thought, \"Wait, I didn't have neck surgery!\" Had PT, reiki, Lyrica, percocet, etc. Primary sent me to Cleveland Clinic for Pain Management. Had several blocs, none worked. Then sent to Pain Rehabilitation since I was addicted to percocet. Never did understand why that was such a problem when compared to the pain I was in. I offered to stop the percocet cold turkey when the pain went away, no deal. So now I am on lots of meds, none for pain and I am in trouble. I made an appt. with my PS. on Thurs. I am going to insist that he remove my implants (which are beautiful). I just feel he could look in there and help me. Maybe the implants are causing discomfort. I guess I am desperate for help. Tell me, don't you think there is a chance he can help me? Didn't some of you receive help from your PS? I don't know what else I can possibly do. Before surgery I exercised every day - walked 7 miles and took 3 yoga classes a week, sometimes swimming. Now I am returning to exercise, but why did this have to happen to us? I find it hard to believe these surgeons didn't know. I'll stop now.",

I am having much trouble with my neck (constantly feeling the need to stretch it), my chest, and my arm. I am seriously considering removing the implants and read with such interest that you had problems with your neck. Actually, I don't know of your history and wonder about the problems you had with your neck. So glad I found you. Thanks, Sofia",
