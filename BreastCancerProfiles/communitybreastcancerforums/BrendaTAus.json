I was told I was OK! by the Doctors Side kick 2 weeks before finding out the truth from the Breast specialist. He told me I had 3 negative aggressive needed surgery ASAP but changed it to Chemo as the lump was 10 cm. I was shocked only because I was told it was ok! before. but you know what you can fight this horrible thing if you think positive you will get through this. i was more worried tell my family worried how they would cope with it. but they do and if your strong they are strong. but you need to rest as well let them step up take on board things you use to do don.t be shy to ask for help. you will be surprised how many people will help you get through this. my family live in the UK I live in Australia but they all are there, in their own ways. SO STAY STRONG don't afraid you can and will kick this. Good luck love to chat more if you want to. god bless.",
