      "Content": "Momma-Scott wrote: A few days ago I recieved a letter from the radiology clinic where I had my mammogram done a couple of weeks ago. This is only my second mammogram ever. The first one I had done because both my doctor and I could feel a small lump in my left breast. The mammogram just showed dense breast tissue. After this years mammogram, the letter I received said that there were some areas of concern that would need to be evaluated, and an appointment was made for six months from now. I called my doctors office, and the nurse (not mine because the nurse and doctor are on vacation this week) said that my results showed benign microcalcification clusters in my right breast. I asked her to have the doctor give me a call next week. I usually wouldn't get stressed out, but I was diagnosed with Lupus 12 years ago, and recently found out that my daughter and I both have a genetic heart condition. I am just wondering if this is something I should worry with and maybe ask the doctor to order a biopsy, or just wait the six months and wait and see. I still have the lump on the left side too. I am not sure if it is a coincidence or not but the last two weeks my breast have been so tender I can hardly wear my bra. Log in to post a reply",

This year showed the microcalcifications on the right breast. Nothing showed up on the left (I assume.Â I plan on checking with the dr. next week when I go for a visit and also ask for a copy of this year and last years report). So, basically it is the microcalcifications they have said to wait six months. I am having the ultrasound done Thursday next week. I am still not sure what it will show with the calicifcations, but we will see.",
