My DH bought me some gatoraid and I've managed to drink some, eat an apple and some almonds. The dietician and my clinic said I should consume 100g of protien per day to aid with healing. That would be hard even without the nausea. I find that during the day, maybe because I am eating little bits, the nausea isn't so bad. But at night it is worse. I'm going to try keeping some crackers by my bed. I was feeling pretty rough this morning, but I forced myself to have a shower and get going, and I do feel better. I've pasted below a getting ready list that I read on a thread a while ago. I didn't by all that stuff becuase a friend of mine who went through this five years ago wisely advised me not to buy until you suffer the  se. Thanks for the tip on green tea - I'll ask my oc nurse today.  May 23, 2008 11:19 pm, edited May 24, 2008 06:05 AM by rockrock wrote:Chemotherapy Tips I'd been collecting pointers from this thread and others which my friend Miki graciously compiled/organized for me, and I have tried to update along the way. As with all things chemo, everyone is different. What works for one person (or one therapy), may not work for everyone. My \"chemo bag\" Ask them to put together a small make-up type bag (say 4\"x4\"x6\" or smaller) that you can move from purse to backpack back to purse or whatever that includes some of the stuff that's good to have on hand when you're out and about: digital thermometer, Tylenol, toothbrush, toothpaste, Breathsaver-type lozenges, chapstick, unscented hand lotion, eye drops, antibiotic ointment, Purell sanitizer or handwipes, Saltines or animal crax, Kleenex, thin cap to ward off any sudden chills. And maybe a maxi-pad in case of any port or drain mishaps. (Why this stuff? Important to ward off mouth sores, avoid fever/monitor temp, chemo dries out eyes, mouth, skin; lack of nose hairs causes drippy nose.) Pre-Chemo/Things to ask about \u2022 What sort of antiemtics (anti-nausea meds) are you getting? According to American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, everyone should be getting Emend (for nausea), a steroid (dexamethasone aka decadron is the most common), and a medication like Kytril or Zofran (the Aloxi you may get in your IV at chemo is in the same family of drugs). Drugs like phenergan and compazine are NOT considered sufficient but might be used in addition to the others. Possible side-effects A description of the functions and side effects of common chemotherapy drugs is available at www.chemocare.com. General care \u2022 Drink a lot of fluid, preferably water. \u2022 For moisturizers, you probably want something as scent free as possible (e.g., Aquaphor is recommended). \u2022 If you get a manicure or pedicure, bring your own manicure set To keep your overall health up \u2022 Make laughing and relaxing as important as cleaning! \u2022 Support your immune system with iron- and protein-rich foods (but check with doctor before taking supplement) \u2022 Careful with protein bars (or any other foods) that contain soy if you are ER+ \u2022 Closing the toilet seat before flushing will dramatically reduce distribution of bacteria in the bathroom. \u2022 Replace the shower curtain liners. \u2022 Get soft, seam-free (or as seam-free as possible) hat for sleeping-in \u2022 Wear latex-gloves when cleaning to avoid nicks and scratches Metallic taste \u2022 Use plastic flatware instead of metal \u2022 Biotene mouth wash (and/or toothpaste and chewing gum, lemon/lime cordial, Breathsavers mints) \u2022 Oasis products were also mentioned Mouth sores \u2022 \"If you get mouth sores, there's a little cocktail you can whip up with liquid benadryl and Maalox.\" \u2022 I put lemon or lime drops or slices into my water glass - \u2022 Someone recommended Vitamin C supplements but my dietitian said \"No Vitamin C supplements for women with breast cancer EVER.\" (I posted her explanation elsewhere.) \u2022 Change your toothbrush frequently \u2022 Eating a popsicle or ice chips or something else very cold, while being given adriamycin Hairy tongue * Frequent cleansing with combo of water, baking soda and salt is recommended, * Sucking on lemon wedges to re-encourage salivary glands, * Brushing one's tongue with a toothbrush, hydrating with water. Cytoxan seems to mess with the salivary glands. Port care \u2022 The nurse may clean the port by injecting Heperin into it. A horrible taste can sometimes be avoided by holding your nose while the Heperin is injected. \u2022 A numbing agent may make entry in and out of the port less painful.* Pain/aches \u2022 Specifically if you are going to be getting Neulasta, Aleve was recommended as a pain killer for aches. The poster suggested taking one 30 minutes prior to the Neulasta injection, and then regularly for 2-3 days after. \u2022 Tylenol is the first pain killer of choice as it has the fewest possible side-effects (I was told \"No Ibuprofen or aspirin.\") Sleeplessness \u2022 Ambien CR \u2022 I'm nervous about \"sleep aids\" so the nurse recommended I take a Benadryl. Acid reflux/indigestion \u2022 An H2 blocker such as Pepcid or Nexium Constipation \u2022 Prune juice \u2022 Colace (docusate sodium) is an over the counter stool softener to have on hand. \u2022 Senekot-S is a gentle laxative with a little Colace added in. \u2022 Eating active culture yogurts (e.g., Activia) is recommended by some \u2022 Snacking on things like prunes or dried apricots can help \u2022 Lots of water helps here, too. \u2022 A square of chocolate ExLax the night of chemo, and another one the following evening. Then gallons of water and tea. Eat Activia yogurt every single day. The secret, the poster suggests, may be taking taking something at the same time as the chemo before things can get really bottled up, so to speak. \u2022 A cup of coffee when I\"m in caffeine withdrawal seems to help! \u2022 Avocadoes (eaten straight out of the skin, w/ a little salt, pepper, & olive oil) are helping me out! Diarrhea \u2022 Imodium is good for stopping this \u2022 Key worry is dehydration, so keep drinking water! \u2022 Stay away from sugary things, as refined sugar can aggravate diarrhea \u2022 From a dietary perspective, you can try the BRAT diet: Banana, Rice, Applesauce, Toast, which is often very helpful. \u2022 One recipe offered: o 1 Green Plantain (not banana) Usually Spanish stores or grocery have o 1 garlic clove o Olive oil o Boil the plantain and add a pinch of salt; mash it and add garlic and olive oil (note from Miki, I'd be very cautious about how much olive oil). \"Nether Region\" Care \u2022 Another tip - keep a squirt bottle by the toilet and rinse your self off with warm water after urinating for the first week or so. The chemo often burns on the way out, causing discomfort. An old water bottle or ketchup bottle. If soreness is still a problem, take Uristat or AZO - both over the counter. These are analgesics which help with the burning and pain. But remember to have yourself checked out if you have bladder symptoms, because lowered bloodcounts can lead to bladder infections. \u2022 If you wind up with diarrhea, I strongly recommend the flushable moist wipes; they really help with general soft tissue irritation. \u2022 The first few days after chemo, I use moist wipes to try to prevent discomfort. Hair loss (A/C around 14-19 days after first chemo) \u2022 Hair net! \u2022 You may want to get a silk or satin (very soft/smooth) pillowcase for when your hair begins to fall out; scalp may be sensitive. \u2022 I got my long hair cut short pre-chemo. No clue how to style short hair. My \"stylist\" said my I should style my new short hair with the tips of the fingers applied to the tips of the hair (rather than my hands). \u2022 When hair starts to fall, a lint roller helps to remove lingering hairs.

It is scary to not know what the chemo will do to our bodies, and our lives. I have finished one, and feel a little better. It wasn't so bad. But today I got my period and it doesn't seem normal. So now I'm waiting to see what will happen next? With regards to the arm port, I have a pic line in my arm. I don't know if that is the same as what you're getting. I'm not going to lie and say I love it, but I know I can handle it. If you feel like crying cry. Don't think this means your weak, it just means that you are expressing the emotions that you are feeling - that's a good thing. I do cry less, because I feel I'm on the journey now, and there is nothing I can do but travel it the best I can. If I cry, oh well. Maybe tomorrow I won't cry.

I went first to get my pic line in - had to wait over and hour.  Then down to oncology, saw my nurse and my oc, and despite my incision openning up on saturday, and leaking out about  cup full of old blood, and still dripping a bit, I was given the go ahead.  I have to say that the nurses/staff were wonderfull, most people were upbeat. I even went out for dinner last night becuase I didn't feel so bad. I did start getting nauseous at about nine at night. I'm on ondansetron (SP?) for nausia, and I take it every 12 hours. I took one at about 10 pm, went to bed. It wasn't the best sleep. I'm afraid to lay on my left breast for fear of leakage and now my right arm has the pic line and it was a little sore. I woke many times feeling a little sick, but fell back to sleep within ten to 15 minutes. I was feeling ok this morning. My DH helped get the kids ready for school, but I was good enough for the five minute walk to the bus stop!! I't is now 9 am and I still have an hour to go before my next pill, but I feel OK. I had some PB&J on toast for breakfast, and am drinking some green tea with ginger ( ginger is supposed to settle the stomach). So far not too bad. I need to start a regimine for rinsing my mouth. I was told to rinse about four times a day to help stop sores. All and all, I think the worst part of last night was waiting for sickness to start. I'll see what today brings.

I couldn't look at the meds going in and was sick to my stomach on my way out. The nausea is pretty bad. This was my last treatment of 5FEC and my next three are Docetaxel, which is supposed to be easier. I hope all of you are doing better than me today. Rinna ",

I'm planning on going to the look good feel good next week. I'm glad you talked about it, because I wasn't sure if I should go or not. Now I'll go. BTW, my birthday is June 26, and I'll be 41 - so happy birthday. I don't think I'll be feeling too great because I get my next treatment on the 22nd. I'll probably celebrate the next week.

I have not lost a pound since starting chemo, but my Onc said he didn't want me to loose weight during treatment. I am surprised though, because I have been eating much better since my diagnosis.

That brings me to another question - body hair. Should I go there? My arms still have what seems like a normal amount of hair. I've still had to shave my legs (although only once in the last three weeks). Eyebrows and lashes still in tight. Even some pesky chin hairs holding strong. Does anyone know when these will fall? I'm happy if the brows never fall, but I don't want to be too hopeful. Mouth sores: I've been drinking water with lemon wedges. I haven't had any sores, but don't really know if this is making a difference. I've also heard that peach tea helps with thrush (don't know where I heard it).

Now that it is summer holidays are here, I don't even have to use the days. Unfortunately for me, I had real complications healing, and it too three months from surgery to get to chemo. Because of that I will have to go on long term dissability during rads, and thus suffer a pay cut. I still am happy with my decision, as I have more energy for my family.

The incision area from my lumpectomy has been open since May 30. They'v'e tried everything. For the last three weeks they put me on this VAC machine, which I have to carry around 24/7. Now the problem is that the adhesive has caused the skin on my breast to rash and blister. So they've taken me off it for two days, but they are planning on putting me back on tomorrow.

I'm not sure, but I think that the more removed is related to a higher risk of lymphedema. I live in a small town and the local surgeon did the node dissection, and I had never heard of sentinal node biopsy until after the surgery. Does anyone notice how BC seems to be on the TV and in the media all the time? On the one hand it is good that it is prevalent and there is a ton of research, but sometimes I'd like to go a day without thinking about it. I wonder when I'll get to that point. Maybe when I go back to work, and my life seems to be back to normal. I went for genetic testing on Tuesday, and should get the results in about four months. Has anyone done this? My mother had ovarian cancer and I had BC at 40, so  I was a candidate for testing. I guess if I come out positive for the BRCA gene, I'll have to look at more surgery. I wish I knew now, because I am still trying to get my poor breast to heal from my lumpectomy that was done in March!!!! Seems silly, if it is going to come off anyway. Also, don't know if I'd need the rads if the breast was removed? Rads will start when the wound finally heals. Hopefully in a couple of weeks. Suzie: are the hives common SE for rads; Deb: so sorry about the financial strain added to the strain of BC. My prayers are with you. Rinna ",

Just waiting for the wound to close, maybe in the next week or so, then wait a couple more weeks for healing, then get my five weeks of rads done. I only have to go Monday to Friday. I find out on Monday if I can get the rads done at a hospital thats about 40 minutes away. If that clinic is all booked, I have to go to Toronto, which is about two hours away. That would suck.  Good Luck to all the Junies as soon we all will be done with this chemo crap. Rinna ",

I think the Docetaxol is the same as the Taxol that many of you are on, but I didn't have to to 12, and I think you guys do it weekly. It was the worst for me. I barely made it through the three. The body aches were awful, and the taste buds were gone - I couldn't eat a thing. I'm so glad it's over. Seems like we all get about the same for rads -  five or six weeks. Mine start on the 18th of November. I was hoping for sooner because now I'll go through Christmas. I finished my chemo on Sept. 14, but my wound from my May surgery still isn't healed, so I have to wait two more weeks, then we should finally be good to go.  Also didn't know that the tattoos are permanent. I went two days ago, and they did a scan, then put four tattoos on (small as a freckle, but they look like black heads). Then they used a sharpie to  make an x on my other breast and then put some clear tape over it. That has to stay on until my first rad apt. It already itches and the skin around it is getting red.  Good luck to the ladies on the taxol - it sucks, but my body has recovered. I actually went to the gym and worked out yesterday - first time in ten years. When this is over I'm seriously getting into shape. ",

I drop an egg into the soup so that I get some more protein as my hemoglobin is down. Does anyone know when the taste buds can return? I get hungry but then can't eat. Oh, and when I do eat I can be sure to need a bathroom about an hour later. Everything is going right through me. UGh. I do have soft fuzzy hairs growing back on my head and legs, and I just finished my last docetaxol a week ago. But at this rate I won't have hair for months. I got a wig when this all started and I love my wig. Unfortunately for me my wig is steam sensitive and I practically ruined it steaming some beans for dinner on the weekend. My DH brought it back to the store and they managed to fix it for only 45 dollars. I was so upset when I wrecked it. It is the only way I feel I can go out without the world looking at me as different. I so want this to be over ladies. ",

I was given six rounds of chemo, but 3 FEC and 3 Docetaxel.  I finished that two weeks ago. Yeah! I am finally feeling better, and it is great to know that as I do feel better I am not going to have to go and get knocked down again. My challenge in front of me now is beginning a thing called VAC  therapy because this little 2cm hole in my breast refuses to heal. For the entire 18 weeks of chemo the hole has been packed by a nurse every other day. I can't believe it is still there. Now, instead of another surgery (which they already tried), I am going to have to be hooked up to this machine which continually pumps and sucks out saline and in the process speeds healing. More tubes and troubles. But I need to be healed before they start the 25 rounds of rads that I am supposed to get. Ugh. They are hoping that with the VAC, I may be healed up in about a month. Wish me luck. Suzie: I am amazed at the ladies here who have worked through treatment. I went on leave in March, and I won't go back until I feel strong. I teach grade one, and that requires a lot of energy. I also did not want to be in a school, with it's millions of germs, while my defenses were down. I have two small children, and taking care of them was enough. I wish you all the restfull time needed to get your body back. I know I can't wait until I feel that I have a good supply of energy again.  Hair: I have a little bit of white fuzzy hair that grew about 1/4 inch and then stopped. Is this the kind of hair I'm going to get? Does anyone know when the real stuff will start growing. How about the lashes and eyebrows. Also, since I lost the lashes, my eyes will not stop watering. I can't even wear eye makeup to help with the no lashes thing, because my tears wash it away! Diane: Good luck on your labs. I know how desperately we all want to continue so we can all finish. ",

Even the atmosphere is much more relaxed than the chemo suite. At the hospital that I go to the Radiation building is separate from the hospital (which is undergoing a huge addition), so I don't even have to go to the same waiting room.

First a few more hairs than usual came out when I ran my fingers through my hair. Then I got to occasionaly group of 20 hairs. This started for me on about Friday. By Monday  I didn't feel like I could brush my hair without loosing it all. Then the hair hurt like it does if you've had a tight pony tail in all day and take it out. That is what it felt like when I would bend the hair or it would blow in the wind. And for me, it then started to come out in clumps, especially at the front where my bangs were. I've just returned from the hairdresser. I'm lucky because the lady who does my hair does it out of her home, so it was just her and I. I don't think I would have liked a whole bunch of strangers watching. She buzzed it to nothing, and then you really could see where it was bald and where it was still holding strong. I have dark hair and obviously a pale scalp, so it looks like a four o'clock shadow. Although I certainly don't like how I look, I am glad that I took control and the hair thing is done!!!! Just the stubble to fall out. My hairdresser styled my wig, took a little of the bangs.... And her next costomer did not know it was a wig until I told her!!!! I look better now than with my dead old hair on my head. Now I just need to practice tying those scarves and convince my hyper - conscious seven year old that I do not look like a pirate in them! HeHe I recommend the shave once it starts to fall. You feel like you're in control again.  Rinna",

The seroma should be absorbed into the tissue and resolve itself, and many surgeons don't mind a small seroma, because it helps keep the shape of the breast while the tissue grows in and fills the void. However, I had complications, the seroma grew too big, and forced the incision open. That happened to me at the end of march, I had to have a second surgery to close it, (resulting in some disfigurement) and it opened again with the same thing. I went through six rounds of chemo with an open wound. I am now on what's called VAC therapy, as the wound is still not completely closed, and am waiting for this to finally heal before starting rads.  All that being said, my surgeon and a second surgeon both say that my situation is not normal. My only warning would be to watch it carfully. They can get a ultrasound doctor (don't know the correct term)  to drain it if it swells too much. I wish I had been more proactive when my swelling started. Good luck to you.",

They also had to re entire the tumor site to get a larger clean margin. Again, the sloshing sound, but this time it did not go a way. I told both my surgeon and gp, but they seemed to want to let it play itself out. About three weeks after the second surgery my incision opened and about 2 litres of fluid exploded out of me. Not a very pleasant experience. I then had about five weeks of home care waiting for the wound to heal. My OC was impatient because chemo usually starts within 12 weeks of initial surgery to remove tumor. So.... four days ago my gp convinced my surgeon to do a secondary close on the wound. They stitched up the wound from the inside so that there was no remaining cavity, then closed the inicision site. Well, yesterday I bent over to pick up someting off the floor and felt a 'pop' in my breast. Then today the sloshing sound is back. Has anyone had any similar experience?

My gp did say some fluid is normal, that as long as it isn't blood I'm ok. He checked for swelling again today, and there is a little, but I am also 'pmsing' so that is normal for me. He is a great guy and said to come in any time, if thats what I need to know that I'm ok. I think that you could have that lump removed if you want to.

I just finished my second treatment yesterday. About two weeks after tx1 my hair started to fall. I put up with that for about five days and then went to buzz it. Now I have a very stubbly head. You can see some bald spots, but mostly stubble. I am regretting the buzz, because it looks like a lot of stubble. My question is, in about two weeks from this treatment with the rest fall? The stubble hurts, and I don't want to shave because of cuts.... I also shaved my legs a couple of days ago and I have stubbly legs..  Any advice? Rinna ",

He (and another surgeon I later went to for 2nd opinion) told me that it is sometimes a good thing to have some fluid because it helps the breast keep it's shape. He didn't drain it. About two weeks later my incision opened, and at least a litre of dark red fluid came out, and my breast was deflated. I had about 6 weeks of homecare packing the wound (ordered by my oncologist, not the surgeon who sent me home with some gauze and tape lol). At that point my family doctor advised that I do a secondary close, as it was nowhere near healed, and I was waiting to begin chemo and rads.Two weeks after that surgery (during which I lost about 20% of my breast) the incision opened again. I started chemo the next day, and had an open wound throughout all of chemo. I've now been out of chemo two months, and the incision is finally closed, and I will finally start rads on monday.  Long story I know, but after the second close I got two more opinions, and it seems that seromas usually resolve themselves. No doctor can predict which way they go. I could spend a lot of time being angry that my surgeries had complications, that my breast isn't as pretty as it was after my first lumpectomhy, but  that won't get me anywhere. Now, that surgeon also did a hernia operation on my with no complications. That being said, I didn't like his post op care and felt he could have shown more concern for my situation. I wouldn't go to him again. But I don't believe he committed malpractice.   I know it is frustrating to think - if he had only listened to me. I felt like that for a long time too. After some research I've come to realize that no surgery is without risks and sometimes things happen that are out of our control Good luck to you, and let us know what you decide. ",

I think I may have been lucky in that I didn't have to make the choice. My only advice to you is get all the facts first, read read read. Talk to the ladies here - they know so much.

I keep thinking that I'm about to come down with H1N1, as I did not think the aches could still be related to the chemo. Now I am sure that they are, as I have no other symptoms of being ill. Do you know how long these aches can last? As I said, they are very minor, so I don't want to get medication, just would like them to go away.  I also had severe watering eyes. I too could not wear make up - very distressing when you don't have eyelashes, so your eyes already looked washed out. For me, that SE has almost disappeared. I wasn't informed of this as being a SE, and my family doctor kept insisting that it was seasonal allergies. I knew that it wasn't as I have had seasonal allergies and this was different. My eyes did not feel irritated at all, but the water works would not stop. It is soo frustrating when people think that you are crying. Sunglasses were my best friend. My hugs to your wife. Perhaps you can tell her that about two months out these SE's are all but gone for me. I hope the same happens for her. ",
