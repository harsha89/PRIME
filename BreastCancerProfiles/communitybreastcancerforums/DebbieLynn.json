I see the rad onco for the first time this coming Wed Sept 8th. this site has been so very helpful with post op. instructions that where not given after surgery . Someone dropped the ball with me . I still have not had a Ct PET or MIR scan , not to sure whats going on with that. I asked the Med Onco. about it , he said I didn't need one .  I don't like that at all and will mention it on my appt. with the Rad. Onco. Well Thanks for listening . Debbie",
