I had a spot check compresssion test completed and then was told to that I needed to be seen in six months for futher review. It has been six months and I had my ultrasound completed.  It showed that the clusters were stable, but it was recommended to have an ultrasound completed again with my regular mammogram.  How concern should I be about the calcifications and is it usually recommended to have continuing ultrasounds given every six months? I would appreciate any input of someone who has been through this before? Log in to post a reply",
