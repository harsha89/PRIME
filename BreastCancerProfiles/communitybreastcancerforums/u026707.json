    "Content": "u026707 wrote: I'm 26 years old nearly and up until 4.5 months ago, was breastfeeding. 2 weeks or maybe 3 ago, I discovered around the top of my areola some slightly larger pores/follicles to the rest of my breast on both sides, no raised, ridged or thickened skin really, and it hasn't become any worse in those weeks. I'm stressing about the orange peel skin symptoms but as I've said, no thickening skin to see and in the light of my bedroom here, my breasts look normal. I have health anxiety due to the loss of my previous baby to kidney disease. Up until now, I've had every disease going so never know whether to trust myself but I am truly in a state. While these pores are slightly larger, you can only REALLY notice them in good light. For example, they look really prominant in good day light but sat here in my bedroom with the light on, not so easy to see, if at all. I went to see my GP who thought it was just breast feeding stretching my breasts then when they have reduced, some pores are bigger (it wasn't the best lighting in his room). Also, when you look at some pictures of normal breasts, other women seem to have them sometimes too. What frightens me is that IBC isn't always well known about and also, my GP checked for lumps and it doesn't normally have a lump. I have no redness, pain, swelling, nipple retraction to date. This panic originally started with a tiny red lump that went away in a day and a bit with sudocrem, so I think it was an insect bite. Either I have IBC or I really need to go on anti-anxiety meds again but I couldn't really think of anyone better to ask so thank you for your time if you could answer. Log in to post a reply",
