I guess it would be preventative wise?  But DCIS is non-invasive.  I think you will know more once you have the genetic test results. You might want to go over to the DCIS area and ask if any women are being given the anti-hormone drugs for their non-invasive DCIS. The invasive part of your cancer is the dangerous part of the cancer (I know you know this). I had a very, very large area (7cm) of high grade DCIS as part of my cancer.  I had all the bad \"markers\" for the DCIS.  And the DCIS showed 10% PR+ but ER-.  I was never put on any anti hormone medication. Maybe I would have been had I shown a higher ER+.  But I always thought that DCIS was treated differently due to it's non invasive component.  I suppose non-invasive doesn't make much sense as clearly it became (as did mine) invasive somewhere in there. But your invasive cancer, like mine was, is ER and PR- and Her2+.  I was treated with the TCH combination.  It has been a little over 2 years for me. I am soo sorry you are going through this with a seven month old!!  I know the worry you are experiencing very well. But really, I am seeing very long term survivors with very bad Her2+ cancers who have gotten Herceptin. There is much more hope than you may realize. You are going to be OK!",

Hopefully THIS will reassure you.  When the radiologist saw my tumors there was no doubt in her mind that they were NOT cysts. My pain was not every day but did get worst close to my diagnosis.  I remember sitting in a movie theatre three days before my mammogram and holding this breast because I was getting these deep pains in it. Good luck.  Remember, they do tend to \"over do it\" when they find anything.  Most of the time it is NOT cancer. ",

I hope that you have received the information by now.  Calcifications, if they are cancer, are usually DCIS.  This is non-invasive cancer and the best kind to get IF you do end up with cancer.  It is not capable of spreading to other parts of the body and is contained in the milk ducts. Be very happy that you went and got your baseline mammogram when you needed to and didn't wait.  I am very positive that if this IS cancer, your cure rate will be 100%.  Good luck and let me know how this works out for you.  I also nursed both of my children, for three years each.  They are now 8 and 5.  I also have no family history of breast cancer (all the women live well into their nineties on both sides).  So I did not rush to get my mammorgram at 40.  In fact, I waited until I was 44 and I had symptoms that brought me in.  Boy do I kick myself now for not taking it more seriously and getting at least an ultrasound at 40 (I was nursing until 42)...and for sitting on a script for a year at 42.  I had just turned 44 when I finally HAD to go in.  Good luck!  The waiting is hard.  While waiting, I just thought I do not have cancer until they call and tell me I do.  Even though I left my mammogram knowing quite sure I did.  The radiologist made quite sure of this. She insisted that this WAS cancer and that she couldn't think of anything it could be OTHER than cancer. Good luck!  It sound like you are in sensitive hands and I have a good feeling about this....reading your post.",

I don't think Herceptin works if you are not Her2+.  I believe that all breast cancer tumors have some Her2 on the surface, the Her2+ women just have a lot more which makes us Her2+. I'm sure someone will chime in with better facts and figures than I am putting in here but I would recommend a second opinion. It seems that clinically you are a triple negative.",

Though they are not that old, my mother is not in the best of shape and my father needs constant mothering from my mother.  However, I really feel is it hard if not impossible to tell people NOT to come.  I think it is part of the \"horrible\" aspect of treatment.  My best friend from childhood who also lives in another state really wanted to come after I had my surgery.  And that would have been fine.  But she would have brought her husband, who I barely know and her two young children.  I like kids, but didn't want any extra around after surgery.  I told her not to come, that I was not in any position to FEEL I needed to entertain (even though she insisted I didn't NEED to entertain)...the thought of extra kids needing to be disciplined (even if they are perfect) was just too much for me.  I think she should have come on her own. But she didn't.  I just told her no. It sounds as if having this person is going to be too much for you.  But it also seems you have no choice.  I understand. The only advice I will give you is to make sure you sit around and really do nothing.  Don't clean, don't cook...do nothing. Get magazines....books and hide out in your bedroom to avoid all stress (if only we could do this when we're not getting chemo when unwelcome visitors make a call)  Make sure you are sitting and reading and relaxing. The visit will be over before you know it....and please let your husband take care of all the details regarding the visit.  You need to take care of yourself right now.  Good luck!",

But I sometims just get agitated that there are soo many restrictions on this arm.  I was also very worried about flying, but had no issues.  I did wear my sleeve.  For me, the triggers seems to be just not wearing the sleeve, and lifting things (which I do all the time).  I am now considering giving up gardening...tooo much lifting of buckets of weeds and rocks and more worries about dirt and cellulitis. Before I had my surgery, when I was a stage I cancer, I really didn't understand how disabling lyphedema could be. My surgeon told me it was something I did not want to have, that I was still young, that I had young children and that this could be a very disabling condition if I were to get it.  It just didn't register.  Now I get it.",

My nipple would not invert when my arms were down, but invert when I lifted my arms up.  And when I bent over, it seemed as if it was inverting, rather than going foreword.  I also was NOT able to pull it out as easily and as much as the other non-inverted nipple. It was almost like it was \"stuck\" on something.  I don't think my inverted nipple had anything to do with my tumor though.  It was not attached to it, and my tumors were small.  I believe it was the extensive DCIS that was causing the inverted nipple.  Let me know how you pass this nipple test.  To answer your question-no, a breast cancer inverted nipple wouldn't necessarily STAY inverted. Mine was subtle. Compare it heavily to your other nipple.",

Another month later, chemo TCH six cycles followed by 33 radiation treatments and one year of Herceptin (given with chemo and after chemo) Close to 19 months since diagnosis at this time. RBC is still low and WBC is also a bit low at the moment. Yes, I think it is possible to be stage IV and have no symptoms from the start. I \"felt\" fine while this cancer was growing in my body. I also think its possible to actually be diagnosed at an earlier stage when in fact you are really stage IV if there are no tests to clarify this. I also think its very possible to be a late stage with no visible cancer but also be stage IV because the growth is too small to detect at the time of scans. All any of us can do is hope for a long, long remission that brings us into old age. There is no \"cure\" for breast cancer. There is no cure for cancer.  But most of us will have this long remission into old age. I hope all your scans are clear! ",

But there were \"tumors\".  Well I woke up from surgery with two positive nodes and then the next day after pathology, there were two more.  At the time, I felt that because they were the sentinel nodes, this was good but later I realized that the sentinel nodes are really the same as the axillary nodes. I know, it is very horrible to adjust to this news. But you will find ways to cope.

But if everyone in the office becomes aware of your situation, than you WILL be seen differently and treated differently.I would ask yourself what your reasons are for keeping it secret, and how important this reason is to you.  What I don't like about the video, is that it is being created by the PR department at your company.  WHY are they creating this video?  To help, raise awareness of living with difficult life situations..or to somehow tie this into \"living with difficult situations and staying on course\" as it pertains to working in a corporate environment...etc....WHAT is their motivation?  Who are they trying to get this message to?  Is the message of \"stay the course\" in difficult situations being used to motivate employees?  You said their idea had changed...what was the original idea?  I would really look hard at the motivation behind the video, what the message is in the video and who the message is directed to. It seems that you are protecting yourself in some way by keeping your situation secret because you don't want to be viewed differently. And as they have asked you twice, there is some form of pressure being put on you to be a part of this video. I am getting the impression that you are reluctant to do the video. Another potential con, is that after telling your story and having a massive flood of everyone knowing, that this may be overwhelming for you and that this is not fair to you. I say this only because you seem to have a wish to keep it private from the general population at the office. If everyone already knew, then this would not really be a con if a video came out.  My last question (Sorry, I too am going on an on here and I hope I haven't offended)...are all the stories in the video coming from the office?  If the answer is no...then this would be a very, very large con for me... Something I would like to add....I  was a big fan of the Sarah Jane chronicles.  I remember one time watching it as I was being treated for breast cancer and thinking \"God, wouldn't it be soo nice to be as old as Liz stadlander and look that incredible and be healthy\"  I was simply blown away when I read that she had passed from breast cancer (what I am assuming here, her privacy continued regarding WHAT type of cancer she had, into her death, but I searched hard to try to figure this out and then came to this conclusion).  As shocking as it was to read this, it also gave me great hope. The simple notion of seeing her looking gorgeous, living and working and then hearing she had passed was all I needed to give me great hope for the future. Although I am not stage IV, I think my perspective may help you.  I hope you agree. Good luck with your decision!",

I read an article on this and thought I had copied it to paste here, but it didn't work.  I didn't like reading worse prognosis in the article though.  I thought it was a bit mis-leading and made it sound like this combination was really bad.  I was told that having ER+ PR+ was the best type of breast cancer to have, as it is slower growing and usually not as aggressive and has the benefit of tamoxifen. This only means that your cancer acts more like a hormone negative cancer, more aggressive.  It doesn't necessarily mean that you have a worst prognosis. It's not good to have hope taken away by reading the words \"worse prognosis\"-not written by you, I am saying reading this in print in research.  Your treatment will just be more aggressive. You chances are as good as an ER+ PR+ cancer in my opinion. So don't lose hope!!! The article also claimed that being ER- and PR+ was clinically not possible and would likely be caused by an error in pathology. I had this (two different pathology reports) and was told that clinically I am PR-.  The article also claimed that the ER+ could also be an error if you are PR-.  I assume this would mean that you are a low ER+. How frustrating this can all be!!!!I will try to locate the article and paste it again!  ",

I have known women who got this scare (at the same time I had my diagnosis, which was very clear to the radiologist before any biopsy.... soo clear, that I called everyone and let them know I had cancer before I even got the results back), had a surgeon biopsy the suspicious area, and it turned out to be benign.  This has happened numerous, numerous times to many women. You could call the radiologist and ask them what made your lump suspicious for malignancy.  Either way, the end findings will be the same. Take a deep breath, and just wait until you know more.",

I have also done this when gardening and have pain that sounds like what you are experiencing. It took some time for it to go away. I also think that mets are more likely to show up in the upper half of the arm more than the lower portion. If the pain radiates to your neck or jaw, then I would want to rule out having a heart attack as these can be symptoms of a heart attack for women (not trying to scare you).

We are told to just live our lives and not worry about it coming back. Because if it does, we will realize we wasted all that time worrying when we could have just been living and that worry will not make it any less devastating if it DOES come back. Perhaps \"it's gone\" and \"your cured\" is your brothers way of wanting nothing more than a full life for you. They really don't know any better. Not really always fair to us, but much better for them. I sometimes think there are aspects of this experience that we have no choice but to experience alone. One of them is the worry of a recurrence.",

      "Content": "Mar 19, 2012 10:41AM - edited Mar 19, 2012 10:48AM by kathleen1966 Hello, and sorry to meet you here!  If you want the most aggressive treatment then go with AC (adriamycin/cytoxan) every 3 weeks and then 4 cycles of TH with Herceptin.  THAT is the most aggressive regimen.  Now having said that, you are aware of the potential affects that adramycin can have on the heart, and that some oncologist are concerned that using it with Herceptin (which you know also can cause heart issues) is a double whammy for the heart.  Add radiation to this, and that will be three things that could potentially be bad for your heart. Adriamycin also can have the late effect of causing a secondary leukemia in the future, though this is rare. The TCH combo (which I did) is only slightly less effective than the ACTH combo. Taxotere also does not have the same effect on the heart as adriamycin does.I handled it very well with little side effects but others have had more of a hellish experience with Taxotere (not to deter you, but more to say that Taxotere is no walk in the park so you don't see it as less powerful than Adriamycin). I believe the difference is not significant in forms of one being better than the other. But one HAS been shown to be slightly better in terms of recurrence.    As Carboplatin is also an alkylating agent, I believe it could also rarely cause leukemia so doing the TCH does not get you out of this long term very rare occurrence.   I also read  that dose dense chemo is very affective.  I was never given this choice. I had orginally been set to receive the ACTH combo, as it was thought I was going to participate in a clinical trail being offered.  When I decided not to do the trial, I received the TCH combo. At the time, I did worry that I was not getting the most aggressive treatment. I was never included in the decision process. Studies also say that using Herceptin with chemo is most affective.  There are soo many factors to figure in!!! If you do the TCH combo, you will get Herceptin the entire time, if you do the first one, you will not get Herceptin with chemo for four cycles or you will get it in the second leg of your chemo treatments?  When I received radiation at the mastectomy site, I asked about the heart.  They said that they are soo good now at aiming the beams (better equipment) that they are not concerned with the heart or lungs as they used to be.  Despite this, my ejection fraction went down to 45 during radiation.  I still got Herceptin.  I asked if it could have anything to do with the radiation and the oncologist wasn't really sure either way.  But....it went back up to 55 when radiation was over..... Good luck with your decision. How is your heart at the moment?  If you have a low normal ejection fraction, and treatment brings it lower, this could affect your getting Herceptin. I would factor that into your decision as well. Getting the Herceptin is very important in your treament plan.  I think any treatment we have can have a long term impact on our future health.  I have a friend who was treated with adriamycin for stage III breast cancer nine years ago.  She does have congestive heart failure due to this treatment.  She is no longer able to work, but otherwise is leading a full life and has survived her stage III cancer!!!. I have lymphedema which will be life long. The uncommon heart effects from Herceptin are thought to be temporary and go away after treatment. Herceptin is relatively new though and they really don't know the long term effects yet in my opinion (and I'm not a doctor). The uncommon heart effects from adriamycin are permanent but not common.",

Some stage IIIa is considered early stage.  That would be possibly a large tumor with no nodes (over 5cm alone will put you in stage IIIa with no nodes) or an over 5cm tumor with under four nodes.

I think it is easier for the plastic surgeon to do it this way and that is why they are suggesting it (easier to make the match). I would'nt do it because I wouldn't want to sacrifice the feeling of the only breast I have left.  I feel normal on this side. No numbness, no nerve damage and no lymphedema.  And what if the breast fails?  Then you will still not have good options for that side. Yes, if it comes back on your good side, you won't have the option of taking fat from the belly to make a breast. But only if the cancer is soo advanced you would need a mastectomy.  You could get an implant, and then have an implant on the other side added to look more matched?  I would think that with close screening, a breast cancer will be found in the other breast early and will be dealt with via a lumpectomy.  That is how I see it for me. I hope this helps.  I am also considering the DIEP two years out here. I hope this helps.  What are your worries regarding this decision?",

I have no idea why I will go off of Herceptin in September.  We already know it got in the lymph nodes.  Is this \"pre-metastatic\"...likely but also maybe not...again a crap shoot.  There are women on here (coolbreeze comes to mind, hope its ok I used your name!) that had no nodes and ended up with metastatic disease.  So, I suppose it is only 100% curable if it is NOT invasive, that is stage 0, pre-cancer DCIS.  The rest of us, it is a bit of a crap shoot.  I think that chemo is capable of killing microscopic cancer cells (and I am contradicting myself now a bit), because they have not taken hold and grown to large numbers, which then grow into a tumor in an organ, etc....and are than essentially immortal. Because thats was cancer is, immortal. It has the capability to live forever until its host dies if not treated or controlled. I do not mean to offend or hurt by implying that women with metastatic breast cancer are hosts, I am just saying that this is how cancer treats us.  It is a bastard and it doesn't seem to care that we are women with important long lives to live, with children and husbands, dogs we love, gardens we want to plant, grandchildren we want to spoil, places we want to visit...the list goes on and on and on.....  Personally for me, I hope that surgery got all the cancer cells and that chemo was useless for me, as there was no reason.  If this is not the case for me than I expect it to be back at some time and I am just hoping for a long, long remission. When I say long, I mean enough time to see my kids grow up, go to their graduations and weddings, possibly meet a grand child and then have some time to rest and possibly read a book in quiet. So a very long time for me. And maybe a lifetime...that would be a blessing and I would see it as almost a miracle.... I have no idea how this will all end.  I have some idea of how it will end but there is truth in saying none of us knows how long we have. I hear this comment over and over from women being treated for metastatic breast cancer.  In the past year I have been treated for breast cancer I have lost one friend to pancreatic cancer, another friend to a heart attack and a young family member to suicide.  I am still here so you know what I am saying.  We just don't know. I love that you have thought soo deeply about this issue.  And it makes absolute sense what you are feeling and the conclusions that you have come to make perfect sense to me. ",

The difference between the two in terms of outcome is only slightly in favor of the AC treatment. Normally, they might go in for a second surgery if the margins were not clear but I think its good that they will do this after the chemo. That way, you will know for sure if it worked. Good luck.",

I menstruated for the first three months of chemo, the entire time. It stopped the day they sent me for a pelvic ultrasound to make sure everything was normal as my uterus lit up on a PET scan three months previous. They attributed this uptake to menstruation. Other than some thickening, all was fine. I had no periods for 10 months with all the menopause symptoms. Then my skin started to look nice again and menstruation resumed. And BOY did it come back with heavy, heavy bleeding that was more like hemorrhaging. I ended up needing to have an ablation (and the pathology came back with no issues).  Then I went for a couple of months with no period and then it returned again.  Now it is very, very light and normal. It took a very long time to get to this point. I will never know if things would have evened out without the ablation.  I am 2.8 years out at this point. I was very surprised that my period came back as I will be 47 soon but I was very happy to see it return. I hated how I felt and looked when I got a peek of menopause. But also, I don't think real menopause comes on as suddenly as it does with chemo. So I think that what you are describing is normal. It really takes a long time for EVERYTHING to get back to almost normal.  ",

I was told vinegar and water.  I never needed it.  My fingernails are fine now, though they did seem to slightly separate and looked as if another fingernail was growing underneath them.  Now my eyelashes are another problem.  I seem to have lost them on my left eye.....again....not all of them but enough to make putting on mascara impossible. And I am five months out from chemo here.....",

      "Content": "May 11, 2011 07:50PM - edited May 11, 2011 07:52PM by kathleen1966 I had/have a stressful life.  But, my grandmother lost three babies, almost lost a son to polio, my grandfather got polio and was out of work for a year (she did not work) and then he died when she was in her early fifties. She also had a nervous breakdown after losing her third child (she was RH-) and was in bed for nearly a year.  She also lived through the depression and grew up poor.  She is 93 and still going strong.  She had a lot more stress than I do and did not end up with Breast Cancer. In fact, no-one ever in the history of my family has ever had breast cancer and the women generally live to be well into their nineties. I am a family anomaly now.I have met women who are convinced stress played a part in their cancer.  Stress can depress the immune system and we need a good immune system to fight off cancer. So maybe it's not the actual stress but how we handle the stress. I wish they knew why this is happening to women and some men. ",

He also has a lot of friends at school and has had numerous visitors to the house. But he likely has OCD sprinkled with a bit of ADHD and there have been times I worry about Bipolar as well.  It is in the family. We will get through this next hurdle and I know there are others who are going through a lot worst.  The woman on here who's husband has a brain tumor comes to mind and I believe there is another woman on here who battled cancer with a disabled daughter.  Then there are the women battling stage IV.  I admire them all. This is life I suppose.  Thanks!",
