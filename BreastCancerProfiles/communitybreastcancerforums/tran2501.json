I had also found a lump in my right breast about 3 years ago. I had a core biospy done and they confirmed that it was a fibroadenoma, it was less thatn 2cm at that time and wasn't giving me any troubles so I decided to leave it. I had another ultrasound about 2 weeks ago, and the fibroadenoma has almost double in size, so the doctor reccommended that I have it surgically removed. I'm also quite concerned with how the surgery will go and whether or not I'll be left with an indentation - IÂ also have small breast and my scars don't usually heal that well. Hope you have a speedy recovery. I would really appreciate it if you let me know how you went with surgery and recovery.",
