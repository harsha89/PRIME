    "Content": "Npreece wrote: I am currently going through chemotherapy. I have not had surgery yet...My breast tumor is 4 cm and I have at least 4 lymph nodes that are positive. My arm hurts from the shoulder...sometimes down to my wrist. It comes and it goes. I have noticed that my shirts are also a bit tight on that side too. I told my doctor that I thought it was lymphedema. He didn't agree or disagree. I do get relief from raising my arm above my head and from massaging it lightly. Should I be concerned? Should I be doing therapy so this doesn't advance? Has anyone else experienced this before having lymph nodes removed?
