Breast cancer can hurt...it did for me!  I have triple negative BC and because it grows so fast your body doesn't have the chance to \"buffer\" the tumor so it hurts.  I was told by a mammo tech that I was \"too young, did have a history and oh BTW breast cancer doesn't hurt\"  It's a damn good thing I didn't listen to her!!  Please go see your doctor, that is the only way you will knw for sure what is going on.  Chances are you will be fine, I know it is scary but ignorance is not bliss when it comes to this disease.  Please, please, please go see you doctor. ",
