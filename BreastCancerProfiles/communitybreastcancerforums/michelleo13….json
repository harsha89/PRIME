All-in-all things went very well. The nurse had to try three times to get the IV in, which is odd because I've never had an issue with that before. That was the hardest part. No issues at all with the pre-meds or the Adriamycin. I got a bit of a headache with the Cyclophosphamide, but that seems to be going away now. Had to wait at the clinic for a half hour after tx to find out where/when I get the Neulasta shot tomorrow. Nothing had been booked. Turns out a nurse is coming to my house to give it to me and she'll teach me how to do it myself. (YIKES!) The most painful part about Neulasta is the cost - $2,800 Cdn per dose. Thank God my husband and I both have drug coverage so it will be fully covered. So I'm home and feeling okay. I'm actually feeling a little hungry. I ate some blueberries and a Fibre1 bar in the chemo suite...trying to keep the fibre intake up! Tomorrow morning I have an appointment for a CT scan. I hope I'm not feeling too nauseous or I won't be able to keep the yucky contrast solution down. Must go now and drink some more water!",

My4pumpkins, I was the same. I didn't think the hair loss would bother me, but I cried more the first day I had to wear that darn wig than I have throughout this whole experience.

The Dexamethosone and Benadryl made me sleepy so I dozed on-and-off all afternoon. I had no issues at all with the Taxol infusion. It was 5 hours but it went by pretty quickly. My new wig arrived today. I ordered one with a large cap and it's much more comfortable than the others. Who knew I had such a big head!! LOL Taylor, happy birthday to your daughter. My oldest is 11. She's been a big help to me through this whole experience. Actually, both of my girls have. I find they help keep life normal for me - they keep my mind off what's going on. As far as staying positive is concerned, I tend to be a positive person generally. When I have a bad day, I think of my friend Cathy who passed away a few weeks ago. She had to go through all this s%$t with no hope of a cure at the end. When I think about that, my situation really isn't all that bad! Got to go now...the kids will be  home shortly! Have a great SE-free evening everyone!",

They tested them during the surgery and the surgeon removed 6 additional nodes while she was in there. They were all clear so it appears the sentinel nodes did their job and the cancer didn't spread any further. This seems to back up what Ellen is saying. It seems odd for them to go back in afterwards and do more surgery to remove additional nodes.",

Capinva, sending you a big hug!  I think the horrible taste is the worst. I want to eat all the time to get rid of the taste, but nothing tastes good. I find I have 3 or 4 days before each infusion where the taste goes away and then I want to eat everything in sight but the rest of the time is yucky! Jenn, you give me hope that this will improve when I start Taxol next week!! Summergirl, interesting thing about milk...I\"m normally a milk drinker but can't stomach the taste of it right now. Edyem, I'll have to look into whether Super Papaya Enzyme Plus is available in Canada. Sounds worth a try! Robyn, the blurry vision is making me crazy! I need new glasses but think I'll wait for a while after I'm done chemo as my vision is all out of whack. Have a great day everyone. Good luck to all having chemo this week, and minimal SE to all!",

Glad to know the blurry vision isn't just me. I was getting worried! I haven't noticed any nail issues. Oddly, my nails seem to be growing faster than normal. When I did the Look Good, Feel Better Class they suggested massaging the cuticles with cuticle cream every day so I've started doing that. Islandgirl AC #3 wiped me out too. I find the same thing, I go from feeling yucky to feeling almost normal almost instantly. So far AC #4 has been a bit better - hopefully tomorrow will the the \"back to normal\" day. Summergirl, look after that cold! My daughter had a runny nose on the weekend and I was so paranoid about catching something.",

Mind you the cancer centre is a 10 minutes drive from my house. If I had any distance to drive, I'd feel differently. Deb, I think there's a lot of guessing going on as far as cancer treatment is concerned. I made the mistake of asking my ONC last week \"So when this is all over, how do we know if it worked?\" I think I knew the answer before asking but thought I'd ask anyway. Her answer was \"We don't. We don't do scans or anything but we will monitor you closely for symptoms.\" Given that I basically had no symptoms before diagnosis, this was not very reassuring! I guess that's the reality we'll all have to live with once our tx are over.",

It actually went better than I thought. Grimbol, hope your CT scan went well. Summergirl, you will be fine! Together, we will all get through this! Kasi, so glad you're feeling better. Michaela, it does feel good to have the first one out of the way! Ipswichmom, plastic boobs - LOL! Kids really do say the funniest things. My eight-year old DD first told me that I'd look funny with no hair. Then, when I asked her if I should get a blonde wig, she said \"well that would just look stupid\". I wasn't sure what she thought of my new short do, but the other day she told me that when my hair grows back I should leave it short because it looks really good. She's pretty stingy with the compliments, so I was happy to hear that! Welcome, Eekwine! Ybrooker1 is right. Once the intiial shock wears off, a sense of determination kicks in. Everyone keeps telling me they can't believe how calm I am about everything. I have my moments, but I'm just trying to stay focused on getting through this and being well again. With all these Irish folk on here, we'll have to plan a St. Patrick's Day \"Cyber-party\" for March 17, 2012. By then, I pray we'll all be either at or nearing the finish line on this journey. A glass of Guinness always goes down well on St. Paddy's Day!",

The first night was the worst for me so far. Day three today and other than feeling tired from lack of sleep last night following the Neulasta shot, I'm feeling pretty good today. I also managed to give myself the Neulasta shot with the nurse's supervision yesterday. I plan to self-administer the next 7 as well. Much easier than hanging around waiting for a nurse to arrive. Summergirl, Happy anniversary. Hope you had a great dinner! Here's to a better sleep tonight! By the way, for any of you who are looking for a way to help ease the anxiety of your cancer journey, I strongly recommend you check out the following website: www.healingjourney.ca/ It's an excellent program developed by Dr Alastair Cunningham, a professor at the University of Toronto who has done extensive work with the Princess Margaret Hospital. The website contains workbooks you can download and links to MP3 files that you can use to practice relaxation techniques. It's really well done. It has helped me cope and has reduced my stress level significantly.",

Mind you, I've otherwise been very fortunate as far as S/E go. Other than some intermittent nausea, today is the first day I haven't felt relatively normal. Madismommy, OMG $5,000 a shot for Neulasta. I saw the claim go through my insurance and it was $2,800 per shot. Interesting that there would be such a difference between Canada and the US. LindaF, thanks for the advice on the hair shaving. I've been wondering about that. I had mine cut short last week so I think I'll just leave it at that until it falls out. Welcome Diana! Hope everything went well today for you. Chrys, I didn't think I could self-administer the shot either, but it really wasn't all that bad. I injected into my stomach as there's more fatty tissue there! :) vtEllen, here's wishing you lots of WBC production. I was told to take my temperature twice daily and anything over 38.2 C, go immediately to emerg. SO far it's normal, but YIKES! Kasi and Madismommy, I hear you on the hair front. I'm not particulary in love with my hair but I still dread losing it! Had a funny email last night from a (male) friend from work who is balding. He said, look on the bright side at least your hair will grow back, unlike mine. Then, he emailed me a picture of his bald head. It made me laugh out loud!! Chrys, free parking! That's great. At our centre, it's $10 for anything over 2 hours, but oncology patients can buy a monthly pass for $35. I bought a monthly pass on Monday and I've already recouped my investment. Crazy, huh! Welcome ukgirl, we are on the same regimen. I started Monday. I'll add you to our master \"roster\". Ipswichmom, my biggest fear with self administering the Neulasta is that I'll spill it! That stuff is liquid gold!! Must go now, need to put my head down again. Don't forget to PM me your email address if you'd like a copy of the Aug 2011 master chemo list!",

This afternoon I went to visit my dear friend's mother who is a 15 year breast cancer survivor. She had lumpectomy, node involvement, chemo and radiation and is doing great today! Very inspiring. She has also done a lot of work in the theatre over the years and has a whole collection of wigs. She got them out so I could try them on. We just howled! She even had a curly blonde Dolly Parton wig! In the end, there were two that I really liked so she let me borrow them for as long as I need them. I like the one so much I think I may wear it instead of the two that I bought. I should have gone to visit her first! Meholly, I think the nurse misinformed you as well. They told me to expect hair loss around the two week mark. Today is day 10 post 1st AC and I still have my hair. I don't think it is growing much though as I colored it three weeks ago and would normally have visible roots by now, and I don't. I also have noticed less stubble on my legs and underarms. :( Kasi and anyone else having treatment tomorrow (sorry don't have the list handy on my iPad), good luck!",

I feel like I could work one week out of every two, but my job just doesn't lend itself to that type of schedule, so I'm off for the duration. Oh well, as long as they keep paying me! :) Madismommy, I agree with you...there seems to be WAY too much BC going around these days, and lots of it in younger women. Is our environment that toxic? I know I am taking more time to read labels on all products I buy now, personal care, food products, etc. That's not hard to do but we can't stop breathing!! Welcome Becca13...that's a tough choice to make. CMF is more treatments and goes on for longer, but not losing your hair may outweigh that! I'm not familiar with CMF at all. Seems to be a new combination. Welcome sweetpea223! Our stats are very similar, except mine is triple negative. Jendon2004, I also don't sleep for the first 2-3 nights after my tx. Think it's the steroids. Summergirl, you're a Christmas baby!! My sister was born on Christmas Day and I always feel bad that everyone gets so wrapped up in Christmas they forget it's her birthday! Does that happen to you too? Welcome Lowrider54, hope you get some answers soon! For me, it's Day 2 post 2nd AC tx. I'm feeling pretty good. I had some mild nausea last night but I took some extra meds and that seemed to take care of it. I didn't sleep hardly at all last night which seems to be the pattern for me.

I feel very fortunate that I've been able to tolerate the chemo well so far, but I also realize that could change with every treatment. The worst thing for me has been fatigue in the 3 to 4 days after tx. With my daughters back in school this week, I'm planning to get out for a long walk every day to see if that will help. I've also got some new yoga DVDs to try out. Jenn and Dianamaps, I also went to the fair on Friday. My girls love to go and I didn't want to disappoint them.

I'm expecting this will get rid of the 10% of hair that's still hanging around on my mostly-bald head! I still have my eyebrows and lashes, althought they have thinned a lot. I will be having 30 rads after I'm done chemo. My last chemo should be Nov 15 so I expect I'll see the RO toward the end of November and then start rads mid-December. Hope to be done end of January. Kasi, I totally agree with you...I want this all to be over so the sooner the better! Kasi, I also have some dark spots on my skin and hate to go anywhere without makeup. My wig is short so at least I just put it on, comb it through a bit and it looks half decent. Oh Carol, your beautician story made me laugh out loud. Fugly disease...too funny! Sad, isn't it? I just keep telling myself it'll be over soon. I think I'm going to book a spa day before I go back to work when this is all over! Deb, I've heard different things about rads. I've heard that it makes you tired, but I've also heard that after chemo, it's a piece of cake. So I'm not sure what to expect. My short-term disability benefits run out on December 31 and it looks like my rads won't be done until end of January. It seems like a lot of hassle to do all the paperwork for long-term disability for a matter of a few weeks as I expect to be back to work soon after completing rads. I was wondering about suggesting that I start back part-time in January while I'm doing rads. Not sure if I should be pushing that or not. I'm not getting any pressure to go back. My boss has been awesome and has told me several times to take all the time I need and focus on me...work will always be there!",

It has been a rainy, dreary week in Southern Ontario. Looks like it may clear up for the weekend which is good. Just found out today that my ONC has left early for her maternity leave. She has twins due in December. So, my next appointment is with the Chief of Oncology at the Cancer Centre. Should be interesting....I'll have to make sure I get all my questions answered by this very knowledgeable lady while I have her attention! Theresa, having young kids at a time like this can be a good thing and a bad thing. It's hard not to worry about them and how all this crap affects them and you worry for their future. On the other hand, they do have a way of forcing you to keep life normal and carry on with day-to-day activities.",

Good luck tomorrow Grimbol, allformy4 and jmull Had my 3rd Taxol tx today. Unfortunately, I reacted to the Taxol again. It was short lived and they gave me extra meds and were able to get the Taxol into me. Only one more tx so hopefully I'll get through it. My short-term disability benefits run out on December 28. At that point, I estimate I'll be 1-3 weeks into 6 weeks of rads. They sent me all the paperwork to apply for long-term disability but it seems such a waste of time when I expect to be done treatment and ready to return to work in late Jan/early Feb soon after finishing rads. As I expect they will do a gradual return to work anyway, I was wondering if I should suggest I return to work part-time during rads. Ellen, how are you finding things now that you've reopened your store? My job isn't physically demanding but it is very mentally demanding...lots of deadlines, need to make quick decisions that impact lots of $$ on short notice, etc. Not sure what I should do.",

I haven't had anything like that in my cocktail.  I have Dexamethasone (Decadron/Dexasone), Ondansetron (Zofran), and Stemetil. They seemed to do the trick last time. The ONC gave me another prescrption for some other anti-nausea meds but I haven't had it filled yet. I'll see how this week goes...if necessary I'll take the Stemetil more often. Oh the hair front...I took a look in the mirror this morning and mine is definitely a lot thinner than a few days ago. I ended up with 4 wigs...two that I bought and two that my friend's mom gave me. To be honest, I'm not totally in love with any of them, but 3 of the 4 look pretty good...maybe I'll have a different look every day...blonde, redhead, brunette. Or maybe I'll just skip the wigs and wear scarves!! Guess I'll find out this week! Summergirl, so glad to hear the S/E are under control. Enjoy your walk on the beach.

I have 4 Taxol after my 4 AC and I've heard from some people that the hair on your head starts to grow back on Taxol but you lose your eyebrows! Yikes! Madismommy, I worry too when I hear about people whose hair doesn't grow back. I understand it's very rare but with my luck... Even the info they gave me at the hospital before I started chemo says \"Your hair will usually grow back when you are finished treatments\".

Jenn, I hope all is well with your husband. It's very stressful for them too! My husband broke out in a rash right after my first chemo. His doctor thinks it's stress related. MaryjRN, glad to hear it's not shingles but hope you feel better soon. For those who have started Taxol, how long was the infusion? Mine is booked for 5 hours! I usually get a flu shot every year. Will have to ask my ONC about that. Some weird side effects for me today today on Day 2 after AC #4 - heartburn, hot flashes, and red puffy-looking face.",

This morning my daughter and I went to the funeral of an 11 year old boy from our church who died earlier this week of a brain tumour. He was such a fighter. When he was diagnosed 3 years ago, they gave him 6 months and he lasted 3 years doing very well until the last few months. It was so sad, though. My daughter sang with him in the youth choir at our church. I have to admit, she held up better during the funeral than I did! Cancer really sucks, especially when it takes someone so young! We need a cure! Missey, the radiation oncologist told me to make an appointment with him for two weeks after my last chemo and then they'll map out the schedule. I know it will be 30 treatments but don't know yet when I'll start, probably mid-December as I'm done chemo on November 15 provided everything goes to plan!!!

Ellen, just wondering how your hair is doing as I know you didn't shave your head before starting chemo. Do you still have any hair? Just wondering because I also didn't shave and have about 10% of my hair left, mostly at the back with a few longer strands on top. I'm wondering now if I need to shave it before it starts to grow back or I'll have new hair growth amid the old stuff and it will be a bit of a disaster.",

I also have a CT scan this morning, the day after my first chemo (someone didn't plan that very well). I was really worried last night as I was really nauseous when I went to bed. I feel better this morning but can't take one of my meds as it has to be taken with food and I can't eat until after the CT scan. I'm drinking green tea with ginger...hopefully I'll be able to keep the yucky stuff down so I can get this scan over with. Welcome Koalakid! Don't rush back to work unless you have to. I've been off on medical leave since the day before my surgery in early July. There are times that I feel guilty like I should be working, especially when I was recovered from surgery and waiting to see the ONC. My job is pretty stressful so I think it's best if I just take the time and return to work when tx are all done! Luckly, my boss and company are very understanding so I'm not feeling any pressure to return. Madismommy, have an awesome time at Taylor Swift. It's fun to do that kind of stuff with your kids. I took my DD (then 9) to see the Jonas Brothers a couple of years ago. It was amazing - she was in awe! 56,000 screaming fans, most of them hysterical girls. It was definitely the biggest concert I had ever been to in my life, so I'm sure DD must have been blown away! Doddlebug, good luck with tx. Moms are great, aren't they? I went to Toronto to see Billy Elliot on Saturday and my Mom wanted to come to my house to do laundry while I was gone. I told her that I could manage the laundry without any help and I'd prefer she come over when I'm here so we can visit!",

I think the red devil name is strictly due to colour, and the fact that you pee red afterwards. I drank a ton of water the day before and the day of, and my pee was normal colour by this morning. The Neulasta shot is usually given if you are doing dose dense A/C (every two weeks instead of every three). It helps to build white bood cells as your body doesn't have the longer recovery period between chemo doses. I am also in good health but this is the regimen that my ONC recommended. You can ask your ONC about it. Good luck on Thursday!",

I haven't done any aerobics yet. The University of Waterloo has a well-fit program for chemotherapy patients. I'm going to ask the ONC about it next time I go. Dianamaps, we had a news report last week about some chemo (and other) drug shortages here in Canada. Taxol was not on the list though. It hasn't affected my treatments yet.

However, there will be lots of people there who don't know as I was diagnosed two days before school ended in June. I guess whatever I wear on my head I'll look different than I did in June so I should just not stress about it. So, this weather is crazy!  On Friday and Saturday, it was 34 degrees C (about 93 F) and yesterday it was 14 (about 60 F). That's way too much of a temperature swing in two days.

He made it about half way but had to stop when his cancer returned. Sadly he died and wasn't able to finish his run. This was over 30 years ago. Every September, Canadians keep Terry's spirit alive and Terry Fox walks are held all across Canada to raise funds for cancer research. Over $550 million raised to date. I'm so proud of my kids' school. My DDs Grade 3 class raised over $600 and my other DDs Grade 6 class raised over $1000.

I imagine with the 4 DD each dose would be much stronger so that may case additional hair loss. Who knows??? Ellen, thanks for the compliment. I do like the new wig much more than the others and the large cap is so much more comfortable although still a littile itchy! I have been avoiding cameras for the most part but I did get some pictures taken with my new Great-Niece on the weekend. Couldn't resist a photo with the baby for my scrapbook! I've also been trying to follow some of the advice in the AntiCancer book where I can. I've been using almond milk for my smoothies, eating more veggies and fruit and trying to buy more organic stuff. Will take a bit of effort but every little bit helps, I think! I've also been drinking lots of green tea; adding turmeric to soups, stews and sauces; and eating 2 squarest of dark chocolate every day. The hardest part for me is cutting down on sugar. I have to admit I love my chocolate and candy! Eliminating alcohol hasn't been hard because I honestly haven't felt like drinking at all since my diagnosis. I do love my white wine though so that might be a tough one too!  Jennifer, sorry to hear you're having a hard time with the Taxol. I'm on Day 3 and so far it's not too bad. I don't have the metalic taste the way I did with AC. I have a bit of numbness in my fingers but no body aches yet. I keep waiting for it to hit me!",

They had finished the pre-meds and the nurse had just started the Taxol IV. I got up and went to the washroom and felt fine. When I got back to the chair, I started to cough..probably because I wasn't breathing properly. The nurse heard me cough and came over to see if I was okay. I hadn't even had a chance to answer her when I felt the heat rising from my chest all the way up to the top of my head. It was so weird! The nurse saw that I was red as a beet and immedidiately stopped the IV. I felt fine again wthin a couple of minutes. So...they paged the ONC who said to give me some more steroids. Then they started the IV again very slowly and I was fine. It just made a long day even longer. I arrived at the lab at 8 a.m. and just got home about 4 p.m. When I see the ONC on the 31st before my next tx, I guess she'll tell me the plan for next time. The nurse said that since it was a mild reaction they would likely just give me the extra pre-med and drip the IV slowly and monitor me closely for a reaction. Hopefully that will work and I can get through the last two tx. I'll have to ask about the compression sleeve. I do fly occasionally for work so I don't want to run into any issues. No Taxomifen or Herceptin for me as I'm a triple negative gal! I seem to only have hot flashes in the morning and then they go away. Very strange. Have a great evening everyone!",

My only comment on the Tamoxifen front is that it's a bit of a good news/bad news story. For me, it's not an option as I'm triple negative. While I'm glad that I'll be done with all this after chemo and rads and not need to have deal with any more drugs and their side effects, I can't help but be a bit anxious that there's nothing else that can be done for me to prevent recurrence.  That's why I signed up for the Denosumab clinical trial but I don't know if I'm getting the drug or the placebo but the extra montoring will provide some peace of mind.. But, as Ellen said, we have to believe that everything we're doing wiill kick cancer's A$$ and we will prevail! We will get our lives back and we'll be stronger than ever because of this experience.",

Funnily enough, since my tx on Tuesday, I've slept pretty well. Mind you my husband is sick so I've been sleeping in the spare room to avoid his germs. Maybe that's the secret!  All4my4, no in my case my STD benefits were 100% of my pay since I've been with the company for a long time. LTD will be a reduction but it won't be for long so that's okay. Jmull, interesting point about the Neulasta vs. Taxol causing the body aches. I had very little side effects from Neulasta during my AC treatments, but have had the horrible aches and pains since starting Taxol. It's hard to know what's causing it. Luckily, I've avoided the neuropathy so far! I'm on Day 3 post Taxol #3 and feeling great. I expect I'll be feeling crummy by late tomorrow or Saturday though!",

I feel it in my feet some days but so far my hands have been okay. I didn't find the S/E for Taxol #3 to be as bad as Taxol #2. With #2, I could barely move on Day 5 because I was in so much pain. This time, it wasn't bad. I'm wondering if it's because I received the study drug (or placebo but I'm thinking it's the actual drug) with tx #2 and not with tx #3. I'll have to see what happens with #4. TSB1, congrats on the return to work! I miss my co-workers a lot. I go in for a visit every couple of weeks and go out for lunch with the girls. It helps me stay connected with what's going on there. I weighed myself this morning and have lost 5 pounds since last week. That's very strange since I've been eating quite well. For those with burning tongues, if it turns into mouth sores, ask your ONC for a prescription for Magic Mouthwash. I had mouth sores after my 3rd AC tx and it cleared them up within a day.",
