Started 50k one a week for a year and a half (creeping up to but not yet in the bottom range). For the last 6 months I've been taking it twice a week and will have labs drawn in January. I want to get well into the middle range prior to tapering off or stopping. I had no idea that the level was so low - never gave it a thought. Bizarre the things that happen as we age. Patty",

I wish I could offer some enlightened thought here, but I'm not able to articulate it tonight.   If you are just a year out, everything might still be so raw - like opened exposed nerves.   I'm thinking about joining a support group or talking to a therapist because not being sure of the future, loss of control and trying to figure out if I did anything to cause this OR if I am continuing to do things that will harm myself or my family are a little bit overwhelming for me to handle. Anti anxiety meds help as well. Other people on the boards will stop by and off encouragement, support and listening ears.  It seems like for some people (myself included), it will take a few years to assimilate everything that happened and to calm down mentally. I pray a lot too!  I just realized I've covered all based, I take anti anxiety meds, do what my Doctor suggests and PRAY!!!! Patty",

Hug whoever you want to, try to get outside, look at something beautiful and for a few moments find a little peace.    Many will tell you it gets a little easier as everything irons out and you have a plan - it did for me.  Plus anxiety meds are perfect.  I was worried that I would feel different & the only thing that happened was my tears didn't flow as much when I looked at a card or heard a country song!
