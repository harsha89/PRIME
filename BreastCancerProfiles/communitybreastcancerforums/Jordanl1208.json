Thank you for the prayers and kind thoughts. I think my mother is embarrassed to get a second opinion so knowing that it's okay feels good to us all!",

      "Content": "Jordanl1208 wrote: Hello everyone! My mother went to the doctor after feeling a lump and then she suddenly had a mammogram, ultrasound, and needle biopsy all on the same day. During the biopsy, the doctor said that the mass had rim enhancement and that it was a solid mass and was basically talking to my mother like she had breast cancer. He was saying things such as I believe we caught it early, etc. and when my mom asked if there was a 50/50 shot he didn't answer and turned around to finish his work. My mother got a call a few days later from the doctor who was in complete shock. The doctor said that he would have bet money that it was cancer from looking at the mammogram and ultrasound and that he was in complete shock when he saw it was benign. The doctor said that it was a breast infection and she should see her PCP for it. My mother is in her 40s, not breastfeeding, and has never had cancer. My mom's sister just beat breast cancer last year. My mother is also very confused because the mass is solid so how can it be an infection? She has only read about infections causing abscesses, which are fluid filled. We want to be able to accept the good news and move on but something doesn't feel right for us. Any suggestions or input or anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much and God bless. Log in to post a reply",
