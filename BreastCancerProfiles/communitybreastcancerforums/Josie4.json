How can they not cover it? 2. WEIGHT.... I haven't heard much discussion about this. Has anyone lost or gained (if you don't mind sharing.) 3. Ug.... Do I invest in a wig or not? I've heard of people who buy one then never it. Is anyone just planning to wear hats? I have young kids. Maybe I ought to wear a wig for them? You ladies are wonderful. Thanks for the support, Josie",

Only one week out of the month when I know I'll be feeling well and WBC should be up. I'm always wiping kids noses and slobber and when photographing babies in the buff, I'll occasionally even get peed on! My MO did NOT want me to be in contact with any kids body fluid. Not because I could hurt them, but because they shed some of their vaccinations through their body fluid for several weeks after being vaccinated. Has anybody been warned about this? I will cancel all sessions if there is a serious risk to me. Any thoughts? It sounds like many of us are starting our second and third treatments his week. Yay us!!!!! It almost feels like I can see he end of this \"ride\" being possible. Take care, josie",

I'm trying to plan extended family portraits since I'd love to still have my own hair. I plan to cut my hair short and send it in to have an \"underhair\" made. You can check it out at www.hatswithhair.com. When did you all notice the texture of your hair changing or major shedding start? I look forward to getting to know you all... Josie",

I did a lot of housecleaning, caught up on some work and went on a bike ride with my kids. I think I'll be feeling normal for a good 9 days until I have rx 2 and I'm so excited about it! WaveWhisper... It's good to hear you being feisty... It means that you are feeling better too :). I watched the movie \"Living Proof\" yesterday. It was about the man that developed Herceptin. While I'm not on Herceptin, it made me really have a deeper appreciation for the women who signed up for new trials. Some were taken off the drug even though it was WORKING for them, simply because they had to document/prove that the progress stopped when the drug was withdrawn. Anyways, I am so grateful for the women who made our treatments today possible. Ckk: my MO said that the WBC levels can drop as quickly as they rise. I'm glad your MO proactively put you on antibiotics. April: thanks for the recipes. I think we'd all love to have someone like you to cook for us and take care of us during chemo! Your mom is so lucky to have you. Have a wonderful weekend ladies! Josie",

Please know that even though I don't write words of encouragement to each of you, I have read every single post and I think of you all daily. I have learned so much from you all andi too am sooooo grateful for this group. For some reason, links don't show up on my iPad, but when I get on my computer, I'll figures out how to sign up on the Facebook page. I think I'm on the same schedule as Ckk, Wave and LeAnne. I had my 3rd chemo on Monday. Im now 5 days post tx. WOW... This was a much tougher one for me. My MO said that there would not be an culmative effect..\" but she was sugar coating it.... On Day 2 I was slammed with major fatigue. I slept for 20 plus hours a day for 3 days. I had nausea for the first time too. I tried acupuncture for the first time (for bone pain) and I swear the pain wasnt nearly as bad as last time!!!! I'm going again on Monday and I will definitely go on my next round too. Amazing! I'm hoping to make it to three of my kids sports games today. Actually, I WILL be there... I'll just probably sleep all day tomorrow to recuperate from it. Is anyone else sensitive to NOISE? Everything is so magnified to me right now! Maybe I'll bring some ear plugs. Yes, Im getting rid of all non paraben free products. The link that someone provided has been great. I don't mean to become a fanatic, but .... I have. I also tossed all of my Teflon pans. Did you all know that drier sheets coat your cloths in carcinogens? All drier sheets are now in the trash. I also buy mostly organic food and plan to rip all the grass out of my yard to start my own garden (buying organic is expensive!). I am also off all refined sugars, milk and red meat. I am much healthier because of BC! I've lost 11 pounds since diagnosis. By default, my family will all be healthier too. Have a wonderful weekend everyone! Josie",

So, I've been wondering about followup.  What kind of followup are you all getting?  Besides medication, are any of you getting frequent scans of any kind????  How do we KNOW that the chemo worked?????   I've been worried about that lately.  I want proof!  :) Have a good night, Josie",

Ok.... have any of you concidered having your portrait taken as a bald woman?  I know this sounds crazy considering I won't even let my kids or husband see me bald, but I really wanted to do this.  I figured that I should have at least a few pictures of me being bald.... for the memory..... and I want them to be nice.  I want to at least feel beautiful.  SO...... I did it today!  I was kind of nervous because I felt naked!  I also felt a little silly, but I think they turned out kind of cool.  I'll share some on facebook when I get them.   Does anyone know if I share them on facebook on our private group.... will it show up so all of my friends can see?  I hope not.... most of my friends don't even know that I had breast cancer and am going through chemo..... I'd hate for them to find out by accidentally seeing my bald pics!  :) Goodnight all, Josie",

I was busy wrapping p obligations, doing laundry, getting the house in order. It was so nice to read back on all the posts to get caught up on all of you. It especially warmed my heart to read thy you all remembered my last chemo date and shared your well wishes with me. Thank you! Chemo went well. Appnt with MO went well. Wave, thank you for sharing your MOs recommendations. Mine said: -follow up appnts and labeork with her every 4 months -she will do breast checks. No breast tissue, so mammograms aren't worth being exposed to radiation. -annual MRis instead -I will start Tamoxifen next month. I will probably get my period back while on Tamoxifen. She warned me to use protection , as it would be bad to get pg. yeah it would!!!!! We are all so right on with the side effects. My thigh muscles have been so weak! I thought I wasthe only one! I went on a bike ride with my family on Saturday. I couldn't make it home! My legs gave up! My hubby had to ride ahead and pick me up. One day post last tx, I am nauseated and tired! It hit a little earlier than I expected. Oh well, I'm prepared. I had my last Neulasta shot today. I go in for acupuncture tomorrow morning. YES, I'm a believer! I will turn to acupuncture for any future aches and pains! I also JUST started experiencing these miserable hot flashes and they are just as you all describe it to be! I strip down totally naked and rip off my night cap several times a night and PRAY that my hubby doesn't wake up to see me (I still haven't let him see me bald or shirtless!). It's a good thing he's a deep sleeper.... Haha I've managed to keep most of my eyebrows... Please let them stay put! My lashes are thinning, but I still wear mascara. I just bought an elliptical machine. I'm still down 8 pounds, but I feel flabby. I'm feeling tired and useless right now, but it's exciting to see the light t the end of the tunnell. I will get back in shape so I feel better. My biggest passion is gardening! I've got 12 fruit trees that are starting to produce. I'm now taking out most of my grass to start my raised garden boxes to grow organic veggies. I need a little more strengh to start that project.. But I'm getting there! We did it/are doing it ladies!

We got a little lap dog right before I got BC. It's so wonderful to have a pet to stroke and hang out with you when you don't feel well! Jam pus, welcome. I had a bMX with tissue expanders on 11/17. Chemo started on 12/19. I barely felt well by then. The warm breasts would concern me. Make sure that you are really healing well before starting chemo. Food wise, I don't have cravings yet. I need to remember to eat smaller more frequent meals though. I seem to experience more nausea and heartburn when I eat a full meal. Originally I was going to cut my hair short a few days after Christmas but now I'm scared. My first treatment was 7 days ago. I want to cut my hair and send it in to www.hatswithhair.com to have a halo made with my own hair. I figured I should cut it before it starts to shed. My scalp is getting a little itchy.... Not sure if it's getting ready to shed. The hair thing is freaking me out! I'm trying to make it less of a big deal for my kids. I asked if they wanted to be the ones to cut my hair and they jumped at it! They want to give me a Mohawk and shave out heart shapes. They also want to color it. (They are 11 years old.) Is day 10 too premature for this? Will I be shedding by then?",

Yes, we are on the same schedule. Are you a little scared of number 3? I am.... Hoping the culmative effect doesn't hit us hard. Lisa and Ckk, so glad you are happy with the old caps! Heatherb8.... I know what you mean about the need for help and that $40 was worth every penny to get something done that you physically couldn't do. However, I guarantee you that if the mother of the four boys knew that you were going through chemo, she'd be having those boys shovel your driveway more often as an act of service. I think you or your hubby should tell them what you are going through. Maybe hubby could just thank the mom that her son helped out and casually mention that he helped on a day that you were struggling from chemo side effects. I mention this so you don't have to shovel your driveway as often and most importantly to give that family the opportunity to help you out. Every kid needs the opportunity to serve. Since we are sharing our stories of how we were delivered \"the news\"..... I had gone to my OB for my annual checkup in Sept. He never felt anything.. I hadn't either. He told me to come back next year, when I turned 40, for a mammogram. The following month was breast cancer awareness month and a mammogram place was offering super cheap mammograms. I just decided to get one because it was such a good deal. Never in my wildest dreams did I think they'd ever find anything. The radiologist called me the following day as I was in the car with my 11 year old daughter. I pulled over and took the call outside of the car. I didn't tell a soul, not even my husband for a full day. I just couldn't believe it. Looking back, that was super unhealthy. I thought I had received a death sentence. That was only three months ago....... Seems like forever ago! We've all been through soooooooo much these last few months! Have a good Sunday! Josie",

      "Content": "Dec 21, 2011 09:24AM - edited Dec 21, 2011 09:25AM by Josie4 Had my first TC infusion two days ago. The treatment was uneventful. It was odd to be the absolute youngest one there. I'm 40 and every other pt there ranged from age 60-80. Several were expressions their sadness to see such a \"young one\" among them. I had a headache that night and a mild one the next morning. I'm prone to headaches so I wasn't surprised. It was manageable. No weird pains or metallic taste. I haven't hit any fatigue yet but suspect that to come int the next day or so. I was worried about constipation but milk of magnesia took care of that in one dose. Momof3boys.... I plan to cut my hair super short a few days after Christmas (it's about 4 inches below my shoulder right now.). I just can't bare to let it fall out all over the house. I had a little \"pow-wow\" with my kids to re-explain things. Between the 3 of them (11 yr old triplets), they had about 15 questions and they were ALL about my hair. So... This made me decide to make sure I don't shave it before Christmas and it also persuaded me to get a wig. I was just going to wear a halo and hats but I don't think it's normal enough for the kids (I don't normally wear hats.). So,I found a nice one at a local wig shop. I'm sure I ould have found one cheaper online.... But it was nice to try them on and it came with an eventual head shave, wig cut, style and they will \"steam\" it so it is a little straighter and not so puffy. WaveWhisper..... We had the same tx day. Hope you are doing well. I thought of you on the 19th. :) Happy holidays ladies.... Thank you for all of the support! Josie",
