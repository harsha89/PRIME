      "Content": "jomako wrote: So, mammographs in April and May at two different facilities showed a group of microcalcifications. After a stereotactic-guided core needle biopsy in May, the report contained the following addendum: \"Multiple additional deeper sections were performed on all tissue blocks and only rare additional microcalcifications were identified. Imaging and histology are benign and concordant. Please note, despite the core tissue specimen radiograph showing complete removal of the small group of numerous calcifications, only rare microcalcifications were seen on histology.\" Don't ask me how that is concordant, because I am unable to explain that given the, you know, actual definition of concordant. Numerous calcifications on the core tissue specimen radiograph is not concordant with rare microcalcifications seen on histology. When I called in May upon reading the addendum, the radiologist stated that he was unable to explain why pathology only found rare microcalcifications, but stated that he was sure that all of the microcalcifications had been removed at the biopsy. A follow-up mammogram was scheduled in November. So, 6 and a half months later, the follow-up mammogram showed no microcalcifications. Since I was puzzled and I like to have a copy for my records, I obtained a CD with the images, and that seems to be correct - I do not see any microcalcifications (a titanium marker was placed after biopsy, and I can clearly see the numerous microcalcifications on the original mammogram from April). The ARNP I seem to be assigned to told me that there were only a few microcalcifications showing on the original radiology report, which contradicts the actual report. She was pretty much useless to me as a source of information since she apparently wasn't able to comprehend the report. So, has anyone had the experience of microcalcifications dissolving or disappearing? I was on a high dose (50 mg) of prednisone last week - I wonder if that could that cause something that perhaps looked like microcalcifications (if there is there anything benign that can look like microcalcifications on a mammogram) to seem to disappear. I've been going to a NCI cancer center, but am looking at switching to another facility after today's experience. I am completely unimpressed by the ARPN's \"explanation\", and there is another well-respected (though not NCI) facility associated with a different university about 90 minutes away. I don't know what went wrong, but the only explanations I can think of were that there were never numerous microcalcifications, the microcalcifications are hiding behind the titanium marker, the pathology department is inept and numerous microcalcifications were removed at biopsy but not seen on histology, or the microcalcifications have vanished.

Very often, a large facility such as MD Anderson is accustomed to working with patients from out of town and coordinating care with local doctors for the convenience of its patients. It might be possible to get the best of both worlds - a cutting edge diagnosis and treatment plan that is coordinated with local facilities. I've benefited from coordinated care from the Cleveland Clinic and my father received care directed from Duke University while residing in Florida. It is very possible that something similar is available through MD Anderson - it certainly doesn't hurt to give them a call and explore the possibilities. Best wishes that you receive the most effective care possible.",

He wasn't receptive to answering my questions, only did 3-4 breast biopsies per month, expressed some concern over getting a sample since the calcifications were in such a small area, and had never heard of the subcategories of the BIRADs 4 classification. My experience at Moffitt was very different. They classified the imaging that I had done locally that showed microcalcifications in my left breast as a BIRADs 4B. They also noted some asymmetry in the imaging done on my right breast, which they felt was a possible cyst, so did further mammography to make sure it was nothing to be concerned about. It was difficult for the technician to get the imaging because of the location of the area of concern. When she finally got it, she called me over to the monitors to show me what the area looked like on the screen. It turned out to be completely benign, but I am glad to have clear imaging of it in case it turns up on future mammograms. I loved how open they were to sharing information and educating me as a patient! Everything was centered on the patients - someone was on hand to get you a cold water bottle if you felt thirsty or a warm blanket if you were chilled. The staff at Moffitt does everything they can to keep you comfortable and things running smoothly. My biopsy is scheduled for Monday. While the procedure should be under an hour, the nurse and doctor warned me to be prepared to spend about 3 hours at the facility with all of the prep and recovery time. The doctor explained the procedure in detail and did not feel that getting the calcifications would present any particular challenge. They hope to have results for me by the end of the week, and I am to call next Monday if I haven't heard from them. No more local mammograms for me, no matter how convenient it is to get it done on a Saturday. Knowing I am getting top-notch care and accurate information makes the drive to Moffitt well worth it to me. I am still anxious about the upcoming mammogram, but I now feel like I am in really good hands, which helps immensely! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "jomako wrote: Does anyone know if they will proceed with a breast biopsy if you have an ear infection? I was diagnosed with an ear infection and did a 10 day course of antibiotics, which cleared up all of my symptoms. The day after I finished the antibiotics, the feeling of pressure and tinnitus returned. After several days of gradual worsening, I went back to my doctor's office. This time I saw a different doctor since it was a Sunday. He is very new to the profession, doesn't want to prescribe an antibiotic, and said he thinks a bulging eardrum is normal for me. He diagnosed me with a middle ear effusion and told me it will go away in a few weeks, but follow up if I develop a fever or severe ear pain. For what it's worth, my immune system is not normal, so it generally doesn't do a great job of clearing up anything on its own. My condition is pretty unusual (about 1 in 10,000), so it would not be unusual for a new doctor to be unfamiliar with how my immune system operates. I am scheduled for a diagnostic mammogram on November 16, after which I fully expect to be scheduled for a biopsy. But now I am worried about this stupid ear effusion, as I am not sure I trust the second doctor's opinion. As of now, I don't have a fever or significant ear pain, but my ear does feel a bit tender. The tinnitus and feeling of pressure in my ear has been consistent since finishing the antibiotics. I'd rather not go back to my doctor's office for a third visit over this ear, especially without symptoms of an acute infection. But I also don't want to risk a delay in scheduling a biopsy if it is needed. It would be just my luck to develop symptoms of an acute infection in a week, too. Am I worrying over something that isn't likely to affect a breast biopsy, or do you think I should mention my concern to my doctor's office? I've been waiting six months for this mammogram, and hope to finally get some answers on what is going on with these microcalcifications. Another consideration if there is going to be a biopsy is that I'd kind of prefer to get things taken care of before a new financial year begins with my medical insurance, as I've now met my deductible for 2016.

I explained the very different diagnoses of the previous two doctors, my worsening symptoms, and told him I thought we needed to come up with a better plan. It was great - he was able to look at the diagnoses of the other doctors and explain what he thought was the best course of action. He doesn't see any signs of infection that the first doctor saw, but said since that doctor is very reluctant to prescribe antibiotics, he was shocked that he did so and believes there must have been clear signs of an infection at that time. While he agrees with the diagnosis of the second doctor, he thinks that part of the treatment plan he gave me (an antihistamine) might have inadvertently contributed to my worsening symptoms. He gave me a prescription NSAID for the inflammation, wants me to discontinue the antihistamine and take a decongestant instead, and doesn't think this will limit my options if a biopsy is needed after my diagnositic mammogram. A follow up is scheduled in two weeks, but if my symptoms get worse, I am to return right away. While I hated having to take the day off, I think it was a good decision. I recognize that I am extra anxious because of the upcoming appointment, and seeing a doctor that I trust completely helped to relieve a lot of that anxiety. He is great about referring to a specialist if he thinks things are beyond his expertise, but I could tell he felt very comfortable with our current plan. I greatly appreciate the responses that I received. I am feeling much more confident as I head into my appointment on Thursday, even though I kind of already know that there won't be any clear answers at that time. It really is stressful to have the diagnostic process stretched out over such a long period of time.",
