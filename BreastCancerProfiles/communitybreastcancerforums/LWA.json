      "Content": "LWA wrote: Hi, My lumpectomy is scheduled for TOMORROW and I'm now wondering if I made the right decision; I am planning to have intraoperative radiation during the surgery. I just read a thing in the New York Times from two weeks ago (I searched NYT for \"breast cancer\") that says there is double the risk of recurrence with brachytherapy, as opposed to conventional radiation, which makes me think that even going beyond brachytherapy, to IORT, might not be a wise idea? I'm a little panicked now because there are only a few business hours left today to decide whether to go forward or not. I guess the question is whether  IORT is just as effective long-term as conventional radiation, and maybe that just can't be known, because it's too new. I've left a message for my surgeon, and also had my RO paged; I just spoke to my ob/gyn and of course she has no idea what to do; this isn't her area of expertise. Would I be dumb to go ahead with IORT? I was hoping to do lumpectomy this year because my insurance is changing on 1/1 and it will cost a whole lot more then, but maybe I just need to delay surgery and think this over?

Are you saying someone says it's not actually true there is double the chance of mastectomy with the brachytherapy as opposed to conventional radiation? Thank you for writing and thanks to all! I am back home and feel great, I must say, particularly as compared to the hysterectomy I had on 10/27/11, which, at least in terms of the surgery itself, was much more of an ordeal. Of course, must see what the pathology report says. I spent yesterday freaking out about the IORT and, belatedly, called my RO this morning, the day of surgery, to see how many years the medical center has been doing IORT. The answer: four months! And how many DCIS patients they have used it on: 10! Well, now 11! :-) (I actually asked him a bunch of questions when I met with him last Friday, but somehow omitted to ask these two very important ones.) Nonetheless, I'm comfortable with my decision. My RO is lovely and said I could change my mind about the IORT right up to the moment they put me under, and he also said I can come in after a couple of weeks and we can discuss doing three weeks of external radiation in addition (no need for the boost, because I had it today) if that would put my mind more at ease. Meanwhile, my surgeon says why the heck would anyone have external radiation after IORT--part of the point is to avoid the external radiation. But as we know, the recurrence risks are not identical, and IORT/brachytherapy don't treat the whole breast, which might be a plus for some and a minus for others.",

The consensus seemed to be that two or three days of recuperation would be good, so if one were able to have surgery on Thursday, maybe taking Thursday and Friday off work, resting over the weekend, and returning to work Monday might be a reasonable plan.

By the way, I did end up working from home this week (lumpectomy and IORT was 12/20), but that was mainly because it was extremely slow at work; didn't want to sit in a cube twiddling my thumbs for eight hours. I could absolutely have gone to work this week. I've continued to feel quite fine except for that one strange day after surgery, and I think the sensitivity of the site is abating (though I'm not planning to bump it to find out for sure :-). However, in the past couple of days, one of my eyes has become very dry and itchy, which I suspect is a side effect of the radiation, so I wish I'd had some eye drops on hand; will acquire some next time I go out.",

(And I guess some say it's all to the good not to radiate the whole breast, depending on the situation, to avoid a chance of damage to heart or lungs.)",

Suddenly feel very strange and headachy, which I pretty much expected, though I felt so great yesterday evening, I was thinking I might get off lightly. At my initial visit with my RO, I asked, \"Is this going to be like six weeks' worth of external radiation side effects all at once,\" and he said, \"Yes, but it will be about half that.\" I do also recall reading that the effects would start at such-and-such level and then get stronger over however many days. --Linda",

Completely unrelated to this, I had a hysterectomy at the end of October, and the day before that surgery, they called to say they had found something in my mammogram that needed a recheck, and here I am. (That is to say, I no longer visit hystersisters several times a day; now I visit breastcancer.org several times a day. :-) Thank goodness for such online communities!) When I first got the news, I was told I'd have a lumpectomy, radiation and five years of tamoxifen. I was most bummed out about the tamoxifen, but two of the three surgeons I interviewed said that with a relatively low risk of recurrence (pending the post-surgery pathology report), it would be a reasonable choice to skip it, thank goodness, and I was able to move on to worrying about the radiation. :-) No one told me to get a bra, but I do only have underwire bras and I'm fairly large-breasted so I paid for a one-day delivery from Amazon of two front-zip sports bras, and they fit nicely but were extremely itchy, so I'm hoping I'll be OK in my underwires, or that I can put my hands on a sports bra if needed without too much time and hassle. Hoping I feel well enough on Saturday to go away for Christmas, about a two-hour drive from here; friend will be driving.  Anyway, just mainly wanted to say hello, and a general thank-you for all the great information, kindness and good cheer I have found here! Oh, I did decide to eschew soy (as well as dairy; I was already vegetarian) and to dial down the fat in general a bit, and was really pleased to see at the store yesterday that my favorite brand of veggie sausages (Field Roast) is made with wheat gluten and contains no soy. (I know that opinions/research re soy are all over the map; I'll feel more comfortable leaving it alone, I think.) --Linda Age 49 at diagnosis.

The surgery itself has caused almost no pain whatsoever if the incision isn't disturbed. I've taken four Tylenol total, and don't think I even needed those. The incision site gets itchy fairly often, and if it gets bumped in any way (generally by me when I'm blowing my nose), the pain is excruciating but brief. I felt splendid when I left the hospital on surgery day, but the next day, had several hours of feeling very strange and awful (woozy, dizzy, fatigued, alternating hot and cold). However, the next day I felt fine again and that has been the case every day since then. I've been drinking eight glasses of water per day, not pushing myself, and have had two massages with people who specialize in moving lymph and/or clearing the body of anesthesia, which were both nice. cycle-path's advice sounds sensible. I think you may very well find that a week is plenty. I'm planning to go back to work tomorrow (though I do have the option to work from home, which I might do not so much because of the lumpectomy and IORT but because the week between holidays can be awfully slow). Oh, by the way, I wish my surgeon had told me to go get a sports bra or two before surgery, because I have totally needed them and ended up paying Amazon a small fortune for one-day delivery of two front-zip sports bras. After surgery, my breast looked extremely strange--weird shape, nipple flattened--but since I'm not an underwear model, I didn't really care. Nonetheless, I was pleased when I saw yesterday that my breast looked pretty much like the other one again; it must have been post-op swelling, in part. Keep us posted, Lisa75. I hope your meeting with the surgeon goes well. Linda",
