    "Content": "melanieschuele wrote: I am helping a friend with a situation that I did *not* encounter in my own breast cancer experience. She had a mammogram a year ago that showed what appears to be a small mass. She had a core biopsy and first received a call to say that everything was fine. Then a day or so later she received a phone call from the radiologist's secretary (she's never talked to the radiologist post the biopsy) that the biopsy needed to be redone. I went to an appt. with her last week. The breast surgeon said that the biopsy \"didn't fit\". When pressed for more information, this is what I could discern -- the pathologist said the tissue that was biopsied was all fat. And if indeed she has a mass, then the tissue should not have been fat -- e.g., maybe it would be fibrous tissue or something like that. So now the breast surgeon wants to do an excisional biopsy. He would not really say that the radiologist has messed up the initial biopsy and not gotten tissue from where he should have -- but that is what it sounded like to me. My friend does not have health insurance and has paid $3000+ for this initial biopsy that is inconclusive. The next step will be more expensive because she will have to have general anesthesia, etc. I am wondering if anyone can share any similar experience. Thanks!Â  Melanie Log in to post a reply",
