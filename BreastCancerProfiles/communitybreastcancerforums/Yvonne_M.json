I prayed and processed the surgeon's demeanor and maybe yes he did have a bad day and maybe he was just trying to come in with an attitude of it's all good, no worries, let's move on. When what I needed was a hug and advice. So, I know that's not where to get it, that is what this board is for. I will go in next week when I see him and have a big smile and hopefully bring some light into his world. This will be interesting to see how he reads my Pathology report this time around. I need to find myself an Oncologist too, our Dermatologist recommended one and no way am I asking this surgeon. :) Prayers for all the surgeries continued. BG49TN, yes this was my surgeon. On the drains, I know right? My dh & I have been making jokes ever since yesterday. Well honey, I'm gonna go for a run now and just let the drains fly all over the place, cuz hey it's fine, don't worry about it, we're not measuring the fluids. Might lift some weights today too! Scottie, not sure if said, the hoodie is a zippered hoodie. 80+ degrees and I'm wearing a hoodie.. Come back cool weather. Oh I found another one in my closet that is lighter weight and has inside pockets to probably put a cell phone or activity tracker in and that is holding my drains good too, don't have to turn that inside out with the tags showing. :) So if you guys have any of those. Got mine at WalMart a couple years ago. Goldie, I'll check that link out, thanks for posting and your tips. My fluid sounds just like yours! So we are both on the right track then. The lady that works at the front desk told me yesterday that it may flow more then less and to not be concerned (at least someone in that office was kind, LOL!). Fight on!",

If you mean the preop just before surgery, well that is pregnancy test, lots of questions with a few people, putting the gorgeous hospital gown and socks on, getting the iv in (I have no veins so that it always a pleasure with them trying to find mine).

      "Content": "Mar 9, 2017 12:48PM - edited Mar 9, 2017 12:51PM by Yvonne_M Hi Ladies, My left Mx was done on Tuesday the 7th, they booted me out really fast that day; surgery at 11, out by 1:30.. I could have used 10 more minutes, but they must have needed the post op room or something. I am thankful I was home though with my hubby and pups. Got sent home with measuring cups, and whatever clothes I was wearing, no bras or anything like some of you. I slept in our love seat with ottoman and a whole bunch of different size pillows. Pretty much just napped on and off that first night. Last night I slept but was a bit more uncomfortable so moved up to our bed with my donut pillow on my neck and lots of other pillows. Little tougher to get out of bed, but it felt good to stretch out. I've been wearing my hoody inside out so I can use the pockets for my two drains. The drains, gross! I've been doing that myself and at first I was so nervous, but now it's easy. Not sure how to dress for the public when it's 85 degrees out. It's so much easier when you can wear bulky hoodies, a loose top and yoga pants in private. I am still trying to figure that out, so you guys have so many great tips for that. Keep 'em coming! Saw my surgeon this morning to take the itchy bandages off and he had terrible bedside manners. Every question my husband or I asked he made us feel like we were idiots and that they were dumb questions. I held back the tears. This was an emotional day enough getting to see me under those bandages, then to throw that in just was not good timing. Some of the questions I asked: * Do I need to wean myself off the Hydrocodone to transition to Advil? Why would you need to do that, do what your body tells you, I don't know how you feel, you're not going to get addicted * What types of exercises if any should I do for after care? Do whatever you did before, what did you do before? If you go to the gym go to the gym, run, do pushups. I said no I mean should I do some shoulder shrugs, etc. Do whatever you want. Go back to your regular exercise. (I have to disagree you guys, I am going to ease into this with stitches and drains coming out of my body) * Does the fluid in my drain look OK, is it the right color? Of course it is why wouldn't it be. (um cuz I have never done this before) * Should we continue to measure the fluid and how often? I guess so, whatever you want We asked some more things, but at this point I was putting my head down and holding back the tears and my face was beet red. I'm usually smiling and laughing, so I hope he saw that and nips it in the bud for his next patient. So aside from that, I am happy to say that I supposedly am healing well, fluid looks right and I go back next week to maybe get them out, they want the fluid to be down to 25cc in a 24 hour period, last 24 hours it was 207 for 2 drains. Oh and to get the wonderful pathology report of how far this cancer has gone, lymph were checked too. One step... Question for those that got bandages off for Mx; is it just the stitches and the clear tape stuff? (I forget what their called). Or do you have them covered? They seem so out in the open not covered. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I've been reading all of your posts and continued prayers for all you warriors. Yvonne",

      "Content": "Mar 19, 2017 02:55PM - edited Mar 19, 2017 02:57PM by Yvonne_M Hi ladies, I'm so sorry I haven't posted, I'll try and keep this under 3,000 words. I've caught up on all your posts and have been right there holding your hands virtually even if you didn't hear from me. xo Mast on 3/7; sent home 5 minutes after surgery in the shirt I came in with, gauze and tape + 2 bitches, I mean drains. Some of you haven't had any issues with them and I'm so glad for you. Mine were super painful, oozing out the top, still draining and thankfully around 20 on 1 & 5 on the other. Bandages off on 3/9 and left with Steri strips, and the drains. I think I told you all this, my BS was an ahole and I was on the verge of tears, etc. I was ready for my next appt which was Drains out on 3/16; I yelled Kelly Clarkson when took them out and it just keep on hurting. (Oh BS was MUCH BETTER on this last appt, very much like the man I met, although I still disagree with some of his opinions. I am listening to my body on certain things). Instantly my con caved chest (formerly known as my breast) swelled up on the top portion and became hot and red. He said if it doesn't subside in 4 days, call and he'll rx me antibiotics. Today is Day 3 and the redness/swelling is just now going down, thank you Lord. I would rather not go on antibiotics. Referred to Oncologist to discuss my Path Report (Stage 2, metast to 1 of the 4 lymph nodes); appt 3/23 Sleep, I have been doing A LOT OF SLEEP/NAPS: First couple nights, the Love seat with Ottoman with lots of pillows placed everywhere it felt good, then days forward, moved to bed with lots of pillows (wedge, fluffy puppy pillow, horseshoe neck with air control and bed pillows put wherever they felt good. How I am dealing with Drains out that are still draining: maxi pads or mini pads with 3m Transpore tape clear. I've tried so many different things and this seems to work the best. I was taping it under my arm pit, but why? it's not going to leak out of the top, unless I stand on my head and that is the area that hurts the most to remove it, so it's open there. A couple nights/days I have been wearing an ace bandage just for coziness and then a real soft top. Sometimes, I tape a maxi pad over my Steri stitches on my concaved chest for coziness. I've been sick with a nasty cold so that has added to the fun. Drugs I was on Hydrocodone and now Advil. I haven't had Advil for 12 hours, so far so good. That's 3,000 words. Praising God for all the victories, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant.",

Maybe tomorrow I'll crash and be back in bed all day, but for today, VICTORY! Molly and BlueBird, prayers for you as you head into surgery tomorrow. Now about DiV, I can't get this girl off my mind today. So I have been praying my head off for her. Amazing woman of courage! We're all going to hold her up!

When I first got thrown into this cancer world I thought \"there is no way I can do all this, get to the end of all this mess.\" However, with a little time, I realize that its not one big leap, its the small things accumulated together which will result in the big things :) This brings me peace as grace is only granted for today, tomorrows grace will come tomorrow! How are you doing with your surgeries? How was the lumpectomy vs mastectomy?\" Pinkskies, Exactly! I need to apply that in every situation as well. I tend to look at the BIG mess or situation. When we moved here a year and 1/2 ago, We sold our home in one day and had to be out in 30 and we didn't know where we were going! Sounds easy but it was NOT! Found a place to live a week before we moved. Anyway, so God started to show me to just look at one box at a time, fill that up or donate and then to the next one. Unpacking was the same. I learned this lesson which now I am applying to this new journey I'm on. One thing at a time. My story; I had a huge lump that I put my head in my handy sandbox hoping I wasn't feeling it. I'm not a doctor person, last time I went was in 2000 for a broken thumb, so I HAD to go. Finally with God pushing me constantly, I went. Doctor is so kind and said don't judge yourself for the past, you are here today and we are going to deal with this one thing at a time. So got the Mamm, Xrays, etc and we decided to take the Lump out and biopsy it. Came back with my dx and my two choices were partial Mast and then radiation for several sessions or complete Mast, no radiation, we went with Mast. and that is on 3/7. I am finally feeling almost 100% from the Lumpectomy, so it's been like a dress rehearsal for this next step. When I got the results from the Lump, we jumped right in that day and scheduled the Mast for ASAP and then realized we were rushing too much, we needed to process, pray, process, pray. Now I feel like I can do this on the 7th. Armed and dangerous. Sorry so wordy. I'm praying for you girl that you get clear direction on what is right for you and you have peace about it. :)",

When she said start walking after surgery, she just means at a slow pace,right? I know just walking a little bit I got dizzy, but knew I needed to get things moving. Just curious. I don't know, you'll know what you need to do and go by how you feel. That's what I'm learning on Day 5 post surg. 2Fun, I almost took pictures, but went with the same thought as you, don't want that out there, but that's just me and my modesty. Can't believe how many people have seen my boob the past couple months. LOL! A real breakthrough on my shyness. I love what your daughter said!! Thanks Sitti! We'll see how my surgeon is this week at our followup and results day. Gosh, I'm praying I see the guy I saw when I first met him, he was so kind and loving. If not, it is what it is and I can only control who I am. Scottie!!! You take it easy! And drive safe! :) I need to get some tops too, like you, I have the same issue. I looked in my husband's closet and the button up tops are just not gonna work for public. Do you all have Oncologists? I don't have one. Have any of you had any leakage from the tube that is coming out of your body? I had some last night and want to know if this is normal.",

Also we have been taking Mucil (Kirkland's version) for years now once a day at night. Should I bump that intake up before surgery? Nayda, I am SO SORRY about the loss of your FIL!!!
