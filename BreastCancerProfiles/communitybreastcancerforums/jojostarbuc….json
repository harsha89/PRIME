In talking before the exam, I let her know what was going on and what my gyn had done. She did a breast exam, said that other than the enlarged breast and nipple, there was nothing, no massing, no thickening, no skin change, nothing that worried her, except my left breast was suddenly much larger than the right. After consulting with another doctor, she said she did not want to \"step on any toes\", but she really wanted a 'non and with contrast MRI', and got it scheduled for 8 last night. It will probably be monday or tuesday before anything comes back. The technition would not say anything, only wished me good luck as I left. jojo",
