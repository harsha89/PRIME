I didn't catch what the Cytoxan dose was.. I also do not have a port and my veins are doing well. The 3 weeks in between seem to really help, although they did choose to use a different vein today to \"mix it up\" lol. I'm really glad you started a post for TC x 4... It seems like most of the women on here are on AC-T although maybe it just appears that way, or maybe they just have more side effects since it's a harsher regime?? Who knows, but I am grateful!! -Keely",

I know they are trying to be nice, but I was trying to explain to someone who I know thought I sounded ungrateful... I have no boobs/nipples, no pubic hair, and no hair on my head. Everything that I identified as being female is jacked up. She said, \"yeah I guess having just ONEof those things happen would be traumatic...\" And seemed to understand.
