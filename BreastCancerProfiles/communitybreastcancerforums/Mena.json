It takes a while to adjust to this new living-with-cancer. And that's what you're going to do. Live with it. It's not easy and harder for some of us given our life circumstances, but you have always been so upbeat and optimistic and kind and gentle and helpful. Now it's time to let us help you. First, get another opinion. Get two. Do what makes you feel like you are doing everything you can. Have your cancer tested again to see if anything has changed (ER/PR/HER2). This does happen. I am so sorry. You will grieve the loss of your health and that is perfectly normal; don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You are such a fighter! Mourn this news and then you will get on with tx and life! I don't think you have to tell your girls you're dying. You're not God and you don't know what's really in store for you. It's another battle that you will fight galantly and with good humor once you adjust. I've been living nearly 4 years with mets, Deb! And you know my personal life has sucked since that dx, but here I am. You can do this. You will grieve and cry and probably lose sleep for a while (took me about 8 mos!) And then you will pick up and live one day at a time, as we all should. Please check you pm's and know that you will now form bonds stronger than the ones you've had (and they are plentiful, right?). I'm just so %^^%$#( angry at this disease. You need to talk to metsters and refuse to give up, which I know you will when you're world stops reeling. I will pray for you and I understand every thought you are having. Many of us do. Lean on us now, Deb. You deserve it and we owe you! Love, Mena...xo",

As a seasoned metster (3-1/2 years), I've learned that you don't fix what ain't broken! You need to hold whatever you can in your arsenal. However, trying a different hormonal just might be the kick you need; but I'd stay with the Abraxane, too. You can use Navelbine when they know for sure that Abraxane is not working AT ALL. I've had Navelbine...a kinder chemo for me. It didn't work, but we had nice conversations...And Femara gave me over 14 months of \"shrinkage\"... Being comfortable with your care is half the battle, no? I wouldn't settle for convenience. Is there anything convenient about mets? Nope. Just chalk it up to the ordeal we endure, much as it sucks. Good luck to you. I'm anxious to see what you do...Mena...xo",
