The days are filled with tears and constant worry and wondering. The waiting makes is worst. I'm not sure how I will determine whether it is scar tissue or cancer; but what I do know at this point in time is that my Doctor wants to begin chemo to shrink the mass before surgery. I will be emotionally scarred if after the chemo therapy I find that it was just scar tissue. Wish I could know for sure. I'll keep you posted and thank you again for taking the time to respond to me. Sarah",

      "Content": "sarah73 wrote: I recently developed an inverted nipple after my pet stepped on my nipple. I went for a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy because radiologist suspected cancer. The radiologist who conduced my biopsy said it could be scar tissue in the nipple duct. But the biopsy came back that it was cancer. I've just gone for an MRI to determine margins so breast surgeon can decide whether to do a lapendectomy or masctectomy. Aside from the obvious nervousness and anxiety ... I am constantly wondering if the biopsy is absolutely accurate and what they are seeing is cancer and NOT scar tissue left from the explantation surgery done 15 years ago. I remember the Doctor telling me that she had to remove more breast tissue when she did the explanation with this breast that I am having problems with. I cannot find any information on this particular situation. Does any one know? I will be seeing my Doctor in a week but am looking for a possibiility that the biopsy is really showing scar tissue and not cancer. There is no lymph node involvement. Log in to post a reply",
