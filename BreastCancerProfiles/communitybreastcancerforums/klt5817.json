I had the first of four TC sessions on Thursday June 15th. I only had general weakness, constipation, dry mouth, achy joints during the first four days post chemo; totally manageable. However, on the evening of the 4th day, that Nuelasta med must have kicked into 6th gear suddenly because my body felt like someone taken a baseball bat and hit me all over (I did take Claritin 10mg/day since day 1). The bone pain did went down on day 5th but then my ears' drums started to hurt due to loads of histamine that the drug caused fluid to accumulated. I quickly double Claritin's dose to 20mg and had to take Mucinex D to drain the sinus as well. After bloodwork last week, my MO told me my lymphocytes count was so good that he will lower my Nuelasta dose in ½ to help with the bone pain and reduce histamine. However, I do have to come in to the infusion center to get the shot 24hr after chemo, because the dose of auto-injection device cannot be adjusted. I'll let you know how that works out after my 2nd chemo on July 6th.  As I was curled up in a fetal position on my sofa on the eve of day 4, my 19 yrs-old son read me the following poem. He said it helped him during his basic cadet training at the Airforce Academy last year. It inspired me as well. So, I would like to share it with you, my virtual sisters:  \u201cInvictus\u201d by William Henley    ",

My RBC is still 12% below normal range so he said to take it easy, light to moderate exercise only. He said it may take 3 to 6 months for my strength to return to pre-chemo day.  DH and I went to Colorado Springs last weekend to see our son. So my legs' muscles are still sore from walking up the hills. However, I was rewarded with such a sweet FB post from my son that include a quotation so I would like to share it with you, my virtual sisters:  \u201cHey mom! Thank you so much for coming out. I know it wasn't the easiest thing physically to fly out here, and I'm sorry I couldn't be there for most of your treatment. But you have been and always will be the greatest inspiration to me! I just want to share a few words from a neat little book, an old gift from my 7th grade humanities teacher.  \"And someday, in eighty years, when your a hundred and I'm a hundred and thirty-four, and we're both so kind and loving we're nearly unbearable, drop me a line, let me know how your life has been. I hope you will say:  It has been so wonderful.\" -George Saunders  Love ya mom! And by the way, you look absolutely gorgeous!\u201d  I continue to read your posts and keep you in my daily prayers. Wishing all of you peace, strength, and happiness. ",
