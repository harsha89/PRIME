My cancer has not spread and a couple of the lung tumors are shrinking.  My lung mets were originally found in jan 2007 on a routine scan.  They had continued to grow with chemo (cmf and carbo). At the end of August I had more chemo and a stem cell transpant (clinical trial) and now they are shrinking!   They can't be sure if this is a result of the chemo, transplant or both.  I don't care.  I fnally got a good scan!

I knew there was trouble if he was calling himself.  He told me that they found a blood clot in my lung. Geez what the heck...what's the next problem going be? I have been having pain behind my left knee, so they think the original clot is there. Yesterday I noticed that my left foot was swollen.I'm thinking I am geting lymphedema and cursing that.  I am having an ultrasound on Wed so they can confirm where the original clot is located.  The treatment is to put me on blood thinners.  I will be giving myself injections twice a day until the pills they put me on kick in.  I guess it's a good thing that I had a CT scan scheduled before I had a pulmonary embolism.
