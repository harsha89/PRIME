I was seeing a general surgeon who did not do reconstruction. I asked him about removing both breasts and he wouldn't do it. He said insurance wouldn't pay. He did an excisional BX in the ADH side and said it was taken care of. So a UMX on right was scheduled for 4/11/16. The week before the scheduled appt I went for a 2nd opinion to a BS in Memphis who told me insurance has to pay for BMX under my circumstances. She told me more about my condition and choices in one visit that I had been told in 4 months. Yes it took 4 months from first mammo to scheduled surgery date. I was feeling a little unsure with first surgeon and chose the second surgeon and reconstruction at same time on 4/19. Glad I made that choice.",

The pathology team decided the nodes were positive as a result of the prior surgical biopsy. I don't mean to imply the first surgeon was inadequate. He did what he was experienced at doing. I just went for a surgeon who was experienced with breast cancer surgeries and a PS that was the same in her field. And they worked as a team.",
