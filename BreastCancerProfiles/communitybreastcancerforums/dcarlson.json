My screening mammogram was abnormal and I was scheduled for ultrasound and followup mammogram. Followup mammogram was no cancer detected. Then today, I got a letter saying that my ultrasound had detected 2 separate cysts on right breast 1 upper right and 1 lower  left along with referral to a surgeon. My question, I never had a core biopsy done is the referral for that or am I going to have to have an excisional biopsy done? Log in to post a reply",

The alloderm helps provide more support and even if you have to go with tissue expanders at first the final results after the real implants are put in look wonderful. As far as the reason why two surgeons are needed? The oncology general surgeon does the actual removal of the breast tissue sparing the nipples in the process. The plastic surgeon puts in the Alloderm or other support substance and then places either tissue expanders or actual implants depending on the patients needs. If tissue expanders are placed, a second surgery is needed to remove the expanders and place the actual implants. In smaller breasted women tissue expanders can be used to make the breast larger and in larger breasted women, the tissue expanders enable the larger implant to be placed on the operative side to match the other side. The breast surgeon needs special training to learn how to dissect the tissue without harming the nipple but for the plastic surgeon there is little difference. ",
