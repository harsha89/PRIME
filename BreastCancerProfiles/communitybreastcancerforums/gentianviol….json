If you look for a different manufacturer be sure to see if the carrier is PG or azelaic acid. Good luck, I hope this helps.",

Previous to this last meeting, when she was stage III, she would tell me how she hated people whining to her about insignificant things.  I did understand her perspective as one time when my DH was complaining bitterly about a cold, I lashed out at him with, \"So, do you want to trade places with me?\"  My reluctance (to tell her my fears or anger) is that her problems physically, mentally, and emotionally are, in fact, more significant than mine.....at least at this point.  In every other way I treat her the same.  Again, thank you for taking the time to share your personal experiences with me; I send good thoughts to all of you.  Barbara",

A question was posed about having a pet theory of how each one of us got BC.  My personal one is this.  In April of 2009 I was operated on for a burst appendix.  I entered the hospital on a Friday night with severe stomach pains and they never operated until Monday night, by that time it had burst.  I spent 9 days in the hospital with all kinds of antibiotics, no food except ice chips, and various injections to keep my blood thin.  I left the hospital with a case of the shingles (which made the incision for the exploratory surgery a piece of cake) and finally recovered from the shingles about three weeks later.  Almost two months to the day later I began to lose massive amounts of hair.  It was tellogen effulvium (a result of the severe stress my body had gone through) and of course that added more mental stress to my life.  And almost two months later my hair just stopped falling out, a typical reaction of this condition.  Four days later I found the lump in my right breast and all of you know the road taken from that point on.  So my theory is that my immune system was totally out of whack and had been since the onset of the appendix misdiagnosis at the hospital.  I now fervently hope that my immune system is up and running and will prevent any little floating cancers from growing.  Do others out there feel that the immune system is one key to breast cancer? Thank all of you for being there for me, for understanding my thoughts, fears, and hopes!  I return to this site often when I need my fix of understanding.",

(I did not do chemo because of my age and the fact that my oncotype score was an 11.)   Everything was okay for the first three months but the following three months I developed increasing hip and knee pain as well as tendonitis in my right ankle......oh, well, that put a stop to my tennis.  At six months I went off the Arimidex and was put on Aromasin.  I only lasted two weeks; it felt like someone was holding a blow toarch to the bottoms of my feet.  That put a dent in the belly dancing enjoyment.  However I am now on Tamoxifen and although I still have a bit of hip/knee pain, I , at least, have less days that I limp.  I dearly miss my old life when nothing hurt and I felt safe.  You would think at my age that I would get over feeling this loss and be grateful that this happened at this time in my life (children are adults), but many days I just want to again be naive about breast cancer.",

My local oncologist was more realistic and didn't encourage me to think I was cured.  Then slowly I began to understand what it really meant to have cancer and I was deeply saddened by this education.  I do believe the mind is a strangely powerful instrument and I do want it to propel me towards a future without a recurrence.  Yet there have been many times in my life that I strive so hard for something that the opposite seems to occur.  And other times that I just barely maintained a focus and had the most positive results.  So now what??  Do I just barely maintain a focus and hope that it works or do I put all my energy into striving and just hope it doesn't come back to bite me in the butt?  You wouldn't think this was such a struggle yet it is on my mind continuously.  I guess basically I believe that I am not cancer free but that my immune system is working hard to keep it all in check.",

I have no measurement on it as I was told it was seen in the frozen slide during the surgery and that when that melted they had no way to measure it. The rest of that node and the other 13 were negative. I did not do chemo (oncotype of 11), had rads to the full right breast, and am on tamoxifen. I do have some lymphedema in my upper right arm and the front and back quadrant of the surgical side. I no longer wear a bra because it causes edema in those quadrants; however it is not so uncomfortable that it limits what I do. It is a hard decision but I rest just a bit easier knowing that the rest were negative.",
