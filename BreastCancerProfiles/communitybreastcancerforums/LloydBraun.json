She has had a lump for 3-4 months and there are lumps in the lymph nodes. I am just uncertain as to what the timeframe is for \"early detection\" since the breast tissue in younger women can allegedly hide cancer due to its firmer nature. I am hoping someone can fill me in. Greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. Log in to post a reply",
