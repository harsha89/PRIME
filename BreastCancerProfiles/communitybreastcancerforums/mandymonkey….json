I have a fibroadenoma, it's a benign (not cancerous) breast tumor. The one I have is about an inch long. I don't need to have it removed, it's not dangerous in any way. I will have another ultrasound in six months or so, just to see if it's grown. Fibroadenomas are thought to be caused by excess estrogen. If it grows much more, we may think about having it removed. But it's totally fine to stay in there. I'm so very relieved. I got on my knees in the bathroom after the results and just thanked the Lord.Â  :) I was pretty scared. But I loved to hear the radiologist say the exact words I wanted to hear: \"It's not cancer.\" And I praise God because we only had to pay half of what we originally were quoted! God has blessed us repeatedly through this whole situation. He blessed us with a closer bond between me and my husband, Scott - he really supported me and we were so much closer (not that we weren't already), God provided that extra money to have the doctor visit and ultrasound, and God blessed us with a lower price than originally quoted along with a favorable diagnosis! I am so thankful.",

Three weeks ago my husband noticed a pretty large lump in my left breast. We think we noticed it because I've lost weight - and wouldn't you know it, I lost it in my breasts first. I went to the doctor and she said I have about a 3 cm lump and ordered a mammogram and sonogram. I will be going to my appointment for those proceedures on the 15th of this month. I have to say... I'm pretty nervous. Can anyone tell me what it could be? It's smooth, doesn't really move much and feels firm. I don't have any pain associated with it, and no other symptoms to speak of - just the lump. I've been through a complete menstrual cycle - with no changes in the lump, so I don't think it has to do with that. Any ideas? I'd really appreciate some feedback. I don't have too many people to talk to about this. I haven't really told my family yet. Log in to post a reply",
