As I read your post, I got teary-eyed remembering how life-changing it all is in those first days and weeks. I was diagnosed with IDC last November, and while it's been one of the hardest, craziest years of my life, I've also experienced more blessing and joy than I can describe. One of the most helpful, strengthening things I've done is to prioritize time with life-giving friends--just a few safe dear ones who are happy to be with me in the yuck, who remind me of who I am, and who make me laugh! Those hours of sweet friendship have helped me through the dark days--and tanked me up for the days when I haven't had bandwidth to be around anyone. I'm praying that you'll be surrounded by a few of those kinds of friends right now and in the coming months. So glad you found BCO too. <3",
