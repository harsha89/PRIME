Basically I found a sore hard spot above my right nipple and when I pushed on it greenish/yellow discharge came out. Freaked me out so badly and I was sent for a mammogram and ultrasound of both breasts. Mammogram looked clear and I do have dense breast tissue. The ultrasound showed a duct with 'debris\" in the same spot where I was having the tenderness. I was told that I have duct ectasia and it would resolve. Shortly after the discharge ceased and I have had not had it since even if I push on the area. The area is also no longer sore or tender. So what brings me back is that the past few weeks I am getting this deep aching and somtimes burning pain. It is not unbearable, more bothersome. The odd thing is it is on the same area on the top of both breast, the spot where you can feel the flat part of your chest/ribs and your breasts start. It then wraps around to the side of each breast. Same exact spot on both sides. I have worked myself up and have convinced myself they missed something and now it has spread and that is why my ribs hurt as well. The pain is not constant, it comes and goes. Any ideas of what this could be? Not sure if I should go back to the Dr to request another mammogran and US. I am a female age 37. No history of breast cancer in my family. Thanks for any input!
