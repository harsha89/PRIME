I do understand you are anxious and scared at the same time, wondering if the cancer has spread. I am IDC also, stage 2, and had to wait months before my Mastectomy. I really do believe at your stage in this, your going to be fine waiting until November 12 and have this taken care of. Not having a lumpectomy. It seems so long from now, but it will be here before you know it. Just be patient. You will get there. God Bless, Kaloni ",

Some say it reduces BC risk. I am boggled. Anyway, I think I am going to be more concerned about my Mood Swings in the long run. My emotions have been up and down everyday for 2 weeks now. I am going nuts! One minute, I am happy. And, the next minute, I am sad. Good Lord! I might as well be committed. I am already taking Effexor-XR 150 mg. I do not think it gets any higher than that. Also, today, I took 2 Xanax pills, and a Vicodin tonight. I normally do not take Pain killers to give me that happy feeling, but I am now. This is not good sweeties. I do not want to get addicted to Pain killers all because of this darn Menopause. I have been looking for Alternative Medicines and Natural Supplements to just give me that extra boost for the moods.I did read on St.John's Wart, and I wonder if that would be OK to take with my Effexor and Xanax?

And, it is worth the drive, believe me. I am 41. I was dx with IDC back in March 2006, and started my treatment there. All the doctors are wonderful, there. And, nurses. My original Doctor moved to another state. So, I have a new Breast Cancer Surgeon.  Her name is Dr. Khakpour. She is great. I had my last surgery on May 1, which was a Hysterectomy. Besides the Hotflashes, I am doing wonderful now. And, I have to thank Lee Moffitt for that. It is very true,that it is a wonderful place for \"Miracles\" to happen. Good Luck. If you have any questions or just want to talk I am here sweetie. My email is kkelley39@yahoo.com or you can PM me here. God Bless, Love,Kaloni  ",

I do have some sad news though. My Breast Cancer Surgeon, that did my Mastectomy, had relocated to another state for a real good opportunity at another Cancer Hospital about 3 months ago. Today, I found out she was diagnosed with BreastCancer herself, and, is now going through Chemo. Of all people, I am thinking here. I never imagined this happening to her. A blessed Angel that cares and helps people like us with this horrible disease, gets struck herself. Please say a prayer for her. She saved my life, and, many, many others as well. Yes, of course, I gained 3 pounds. So, Weight Watchers here I come! I will try it and see. Maybe, I can get down to 120 again. Not! Well, my sweeties, I will catch up a little here. I will talk to you soon. Bye. God Bless, Love,Kaloni",

I move into my own little place on Oct 10. I wonder if I am going to be OK. I am worrying about what if's, and, I know I shouldn't. I am having my bloodwork done Sept 11.

And, I am reading a little and catching up some. Yes! I have been extremely busy here. I finally moved into my own little place, and, I am still slowly getting everything in its place. That is not counting the decorating part. Ha. It is really nice. Cozy and Peaceful. I am on the lake here, so, I go out back and feed my babies which are cute little ducks. They have their little babies waddling around. They are just precious. My back deck is huge and Mike came over and planted some beautiful plants for me. Today, I have the day off, so, I am going to work on more stuff inside, and, try and sort through. Ha. It is getting so close to the Holidays, and, I am all ready starting my baking. I am doing some yummie Sugar cookies for now. I love a Plain Sugar cookie. It is just enough for me. Ha. I hope everyone is well. Sue, You keep letting that sun shine in on you. You know what? Some days are still very hard for me. And, Shirlann, thank God for the Anti-depressants! They do me wonders! I take Effexor-XR and, it is some good stuff. On my days off, I pop a Xanax pill to daze out a bit. Ha! It helps calm that overwhelmed feeling I get so much. Yes, I suffer from Post-Traumatic Syndrome here. Ha. But, I feel so blessed to be just right here. Just sitting here at my computer. Melody, I still pray for you, and keep you in my thoughts. You hang in there. It will get better. I call these times in our life, \"Hurdles\" and, that is exactly what they are. They come and they go. And, we just wait and try and get through it all. And, that we do. Well, It is early here, and, I think I am going to put some sugar cookies in the oven. I sure get started early dont I? Keep Your chins up and keep smiling, because, your so special. And, I will check on you sweeties real soon. God Bless   Love,Kaloni    ",

Our cancers were very much alike. But, I was a Stage 2. And, 1/6 nodes. I have studied alot about my own IDC, but, I have not learned a whole lot about the Triple Negative breastcancers. I am all done with treatment and all now. I am just recooperating from my Hysterectomy I had on May1. Yes, Menapause is slowly creeping up to me. Ha! They say Black Cohosh is great to take for the Menapausal symptoms, like Hot Flashes. So, I am going to be taking that. Other than that, I do want to learn more about our Triple Negative Cancers. So, I am back to my studying. Ha! Well get some rest. And, do not get too drunk silly. Especially, in a gay village. Ha! Bye sweetie.

I have been trying to read this whole page of posts, and trying to clean by lovely birds beds. Mr. Tweet and Miss LilySue. Ha! They are definitly spoiled rotten. Jane, That is just awful about those animals. If there is a way you can take that dog in and give him a loving home. Do it! I am such a animal lover. In my beginning years in college, I wanted to be a Veterinarian. But, I could not handle the cirriculam. Plus, having to put an animal to sleep or seeing one really hurt, was just to emotional for me. I was watching Ellen one day, and there was a man on there.Him and his wife live in Peurto Rico, and they rescue dogs that live on the Islands there, and on the streets. And, they give them temporary homes, and feed them and nurture them to good health. They then, find them good homes here in the US, through the adoption agencies like the Humane Society and SPCA's nationwide. I think this is so sweet of him to go out of his way for these dogs. They are truley special people. I think the website is called Island Dog out of Peurto Rico. It is an Organization he has there, and you can donate to these animals. I will look it up and give it to you. Well, I guess, I will read some more here. Ha. Take Care. God Bless, Love,Kaloni The website is. www.islanddog.org   ",

I wish I could build a special place for all the animals that are homeless, or that are living under bad circumstances. Maybe. I would like to start a website to see if people will donate for a fund to start something special for the animals. I would love that. And, Sue, you hang in there lady. Your going to be fine. Yes, it could be from heavy lifting. Be careful with that, as well. I have to be careful still with my left arm, where they took my lymphnodes out. Did I spell that right? Ha! You know Lymphedema can still occur, unfortunately. So, just be careful, my sweetie. , God Bless,  Love,Kaloni    ",

Well, I am making it short and sweet here. I just want you to know I love you all. God Bless,   Love,Kaloni  ",

You think you are not strong for some reason. But, deep down, God has given you strength to get through this. I did it! Your going to do it too! You leave this in God's hands. Talk to him daily and he will be right there with you. He will guide you through this. You are getting there each day a little more closer. You just hold right on. Believe me, You will see that tiny light shining through and it will only get bigger and brighter. God Bless, Kaloni ",
