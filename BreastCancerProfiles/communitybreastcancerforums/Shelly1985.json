He said it was just fibrocystic breasts. I am less convinced. The antibiotic my doctor had prescribed did nothing other than take the redness away but has since come back twice but resolved on its own. My lump still seems to be growing. The pain had decreased but suddenly it's back with a vengeance. The lump is so large it's poking out. Saw the OB/GYN last week and I felt for the first time that someone was kind of listening. He poked and squeezed the lump and is sending me back to the breast surgeon but said it didn't appear to have any of the markings of breast cancer. He said they may do a biopsy but they don't like doing that due to risk of infection. Still waiting to find out when my appointment is.",

I have visited this site frequently in the last year since my breast problems began and everyone seems so pleasant and helpful. Mostly I just need a way to get all this out so I can stop stressing so much about it. I feel like my family is tired of hearing about it so I've given up talking to them about any issues. That hasn't stopped my concerns or anxiety though. My problems started almost a year ago. I noticed my left nipple was swollen and remained hard all the time. The entire nipple/areola area was sore. There was also a few drops of clear discharge. I brought it up to my doctor at the time (I attend a Family Practice Residency so the doctors are only there for 2-3 years) and he blew it off without even doing an exam. I ignored it at the time and assumed the doctor knows what he's doing. The pain continued but usually only severe for about 3-4 days at a time. I payed attention to the times it was hurting to see if there was a connection to my period, but it happened at different times during my cycle. A few months later (around February of this year) I discovered a lump about the size of a pea near my nipple and noticed the areola around the area of the lump hard darkened and still remains that way to this day. The doctor finally agreed to look at it, but didn't perform a breast exam or feel it at all. Again he said it was nothing. In April I brought it up again and instead of examining it, he ordered an ultrasound for both breasts. By this time the lump had doubled in size. When I went for the ultrasound, they only did the left breast and said my breast was dense but they didn't see anything. I wanted to believe there was nothing to be concerned about, but I broke down leaving my appointment. Clearly there is something there and I'm having pain, why is no one taking this seriously? The doctor I was seeing finished his residency in June and I saw my new doctor in July. Luckily, I got a woman doctor this time and at my first visit with her she performed a breast exam (finally!). At this point almost my entire left areola was dark brown (my right is pink) and the skin above the lump was extremely thick. I would get these pain were it felt like my entire nipple area was tightening and it would hurt very badly. She believed it was due to my hidradenitis suppurativa under my breasts and decided to wait and come back in a month. During that time, the areola became extremely dry and the skin peeled off within a weeks time. I noticed discharge on my nipple (thick white) but it didn't leak out. She said this was normal. By the time I went to my next appointment, my areola was swollen and raised from the rest of my breast and there was an area that was red spreading from it. She diagnosed it as cellulitis of the breast and prescribed me antibiotics (Clindamycin) for 10 days and referred me to a breast surgeon. I'm almost finished with the antibiotic and am seeing the surgeon tomorrow morning. The swelling and redness is gone but the breast lump is still there. Sometimes the lump is more prominent than other times but is visible. From what I can tell, it is about one inch long and about a half-inch wide. I already suffer from anxiety and all this is not helping. I try to remind myself that most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but I just can't seem to get my mind off of it. I'm hoping for a biopsy tomorrow so I can finally know for sure if it's something I really should be concerned about or not. Sorry to write a novel here, but I really needed to get this off my chest (no pun intended). Log in to post a reply",
