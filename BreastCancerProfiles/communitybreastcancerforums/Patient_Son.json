      "Content": "Oct 21, 2012 06:37PM - edited Oct 21, 2012 06:39PM by Patient_Son After 6 hours the hospital contacted the surgeon who called us back.He told us that in her particular case shouln't be a problem because the amount she was bleeding since beginning was not much.Since i read a lot before the surgery  I knew already about the drainage I followed someone advice to buy a cheap measuring cup and measure the amount  of blood drained and the intervals time to make sure she was not bleeding above normal.So he told me that as long as she get no fever,no swelling in the area where the tube was inserted or suppuration she should be alright until tomorrow that he reschedule her visit. Again thanks everyone it's a great thing to have forums like these because I know is very difficult for patients and even worse when things like these happens and you can find the answer and or comfort here.I don't' consider myself a super son I'm in a way repaying all she did for me through all these years  even until not long ago when I came back from Iraq she dealt with my situation adapting back home and dealing with my PTSD and all that. I'm the one proud because she has accepted things with so much strength  and with a positive attitude even when she knows the worse is yet to come.There have been 1 or 2 times where somebody had to take my place because not everyday is a sunny day is been 6 years and I still my bad days but I learning to deal with it and indirectly she has helped me because her condition is way worse and she still with a smile in her face.Sorry to burden with my situation just sharing my mom experience. And for those of you dealing with cancer don't give up life is to pretty and worth fighting for.",

I bet there are lots of woman who just be diagnosed breast cancer that may require surgery and like my mother they are worried.In every surgery thers's risk i myself was worried but after seeing how fast everything has happened and how \"well\" it turned out how fast she healed how fast she is on her feet again that whoever is reading this and its going to get surgery is not as bad as one may think. Of course I'm talking as a relative and judging  by the way I see how she was before surgery and after.Before surgery she was very depress almost not wanting to talk to anyone and now she is feeling way better you can tell just by looking at her face.It's difficult to assimilate  that part of your body will be removed but your life will be saved and with toady's technology and advancements in medicine you can have reconstruction on very same surgery however is not recommendable until treatment is done in case cancer recurrence.Thanks you all for your support thanks for caring and keep the good work.This forum serves  a very special purpose bringing  knowledge comfort and hope to all the people suffering from breast cancer.",

Is this something I should run to ER right now? There is no way to contact the surgeon until Monday.The area where the tube was inserted bleeded on few occassions before  I would say less than 5mls and inside the cointainer maybe 50 mls every 12 hours or so.Right now without the tube it bleeded less than 10-15 mls and it stop.She is worried but also she told me that she feel so releive because it don't hurt cause nothing is pulling the tissue.Any advice I would greatly appreciatte.Please bear with me English is my second language and the reason i wrote is because she don't know English.
