Suddenly feel so aware how much this has all changed me and that I have obviously been feeling very angry but have suppressed it in order to get through the early stages and to reassure my friends and family that I'm 'fine'. I want to feel like me again or atleast feel like a more relaxed and happy new me, but my head is still reeling. So I'm going into the radiotherapy feeling a bit battered and bruised emotionally..can anyone relate",
