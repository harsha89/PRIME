      "Content": "Jun 28, 2012 06:40PM - edited Jun 28, 2012 06:49PM by Melrosemelrose HAIR  (I know that this topic is not an easy one for us but here we go!!!) As each of you are well aware of, hair is affected by the chemo.  this is just a very quick read on hair loss just to give you a brief idea of what to expect.  Handling the hair loss is very personal and so the decision is up to each of you as to if and when you cut your hair and how much you cut.  There are no written guidelines as to how much to cut or when to cut.  It is what you feel the most comfortable doing.  Whatever you decide to do, take control over the hair before it takes control over you.  I know you won't understand that statement now but you will later. What to expect:  Most people experience scalp pain about a week after the first chemo round.  The scalp can become very sensitive, tingle, itch and even be sore.  The hair loss may begin within 14 days after the beginning of chemo.  It will come out a little at first and then the hair loss will increase.  Please be aware that when you wash your hair when you are in the shower, you will become very much aware of the hair loss.    What to do:  Once the hair loss increases, the hair will be everywhere.  I used a lint roller to get the hair off of me, my clothes and my pillow and bed.  This is the time when most decide to cut the hair short or have it cut very very close to the scalp.  Just remember the decision is up to you as to how much to cut because it is a very emotional time.  No matter what you do, just remember you are still beautiful now matter how much hair you have on your head.  There are lots of options for head coverings--- hats, scarves, Buffs, wigs, etc.  It's just a matter of personal choice.  You can contact the American Cancer Society and attend a Look Good Feel Good session to get a make up session and can even get a free wig.  Also the TLC catalogue is a great source for headcovers, wigs, etc. There is a chemo board thread called Hair, Hair, Hair that can also be a great support and resource for you.  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/707348?page=527#idx_15793 The rest of the hair:  Loss of the eyebrows, eye lashes, leg and arm hair and down south can also occur.  Sometimes it occurs during the chemotherapy or after the completion of chemotherapy.  My short hair story:I opted to cut my short bob to a very very short boy haircut about 2 1/2 weeks after my first treatment because I got so annoyed with the hair everywhere. I was the one who took control and made five little ponytails of the longest sections of my bob and clipped those ponytails off myself.  It was a very liberating experience for me since I took control and did the cutting myself.  My husband used his trusty electric clippers with a 1 inch guard to clean up the sides and back so I now had a cute short boy pixie cut.  I opted not to shave my head and glad I did not.  I recently had my fourth round of chemo and have not loss all of my hair.  I have a thin veil of hair with stubs growing.  I'm glad that I did not shave it since some of the gals on one of the chemo threads I'm on wish that they had not shaved their heads.  It was my decision before I started to have to not shave my head close because I wanted to see if the chemo would take out all of my hair and felt that the transition from having waist length hair in February 2012 to being bald by May 2012 would be too much for me. Wishing each of you the best!!!  You can do this.... because you are each stronger than you know!!!!",

Lauren423- chemo brain is being forgetful and absent minded and unable to concentrate and focus after having chemo.  I've read in various places that it is real and not just something we all say as an excuse as to why we forget and/or confuse things after starting chemo.  Not only are we having the actual chemo infusions but also the pre-med drugs right before the chemo is being administered as well as anti- nausea drugs and any other drugs that one feels she needs (ie anti anxiety meds/ sleeping meds). ",

After the first treatment, keep drinking the fluids to help flush the chemo out of your body.  I know you may not feel like eating but try to eat 5-6 small meals every day.  A fed tummy is a happy tummy.  If your side effects start to escalate, call your onco to get some help asap.  Doesn't matter what time of day it is or what day of the week it is, just call.  They really want to help you get side effects under control and expect you to call.  GOOD LUCK ON THE FIRST TREATMENT!!!  WISHING MINIMAL SIDE EFFECTS FOR ALL!!!!  YOU CAN DO THIS.  Once you get through the first one, you need to say out loud \" I AM DOING THIS!!!!\"",

How to keep a happy tummy during chemo-I almost forgot to tell you that you should try to eat 5-6 small meals rather than 3 big meals day.  Keeping something in your tummy constantly will help.  In short, a fed tummy is a happy tummy.  You probably need to take your anti-nausea meds with food since those drugs on an empty stomach may cause nausea.  Trying to figure out what to eat was starting to make my brain hurt so thank goodness the oncology navigator gave me that cookbook I mentioned above.  Drinking liquids is very boring and sometimes just plain untasty.  I sometimes put an orange slice in my water to help flavor it.  I also just add cut up fruit to my water (strawberries/berries/grapes). Eating watermelon and grapes can also help add fluids to your body.  You can also drink gatorade.  I sometimes drink decaffinated ice tea.  I also fill up two 32 ounce Nalgene bottles so I just drink out of two containers.  For some reason the idea of drinking multiple glasses of water seems undaunting to me and keeping track of the number of glasses is not easy when one isn't feeling well. I had a one inch pixie cut at the beginning of my 2nd round of chemo.  That following week, the hair really started to go.  I tried not to panic about the hair loss.  I used a lint roller to get the hair off of my neck, back, etc., my bed, my clothes.  Yes, there was plenty of hair in the shower drain but after a while, the hair loss subsided.  I never have lost all of my hair.  I have sparse hair all over my head and now heading into the 5th round tomorrow.  I have some stubbies and some peach fuzz.  I don't know if that new growth will fall out after these last two rounds but at least it gives me hope that those little hair follicles are trying awfully hard to make hair again!!!!  I have a wig from the American Cancer Society ( it was free through its Look Good Feel Good program which you can check out on line) that sits in a ziploc bag.  It's too hot to wear it and plus it just isn't me.  I wear hats, caps, bandanas and Buffs.  As your hair goes, just remember that you are beautiful no matter what!!! HUGS to each of you and hoping for minimal side effects for all.!!!! The first infusion is an anxious time but you will realize how doable chemo is and that you can do this!!!",

Jennifer404 & swimmom01- The hair is very personal decision and choice that each makes with chemo.  There is not right way or wrong way here.  Whatever you decide to do, always take control over the hair before it takes control over you.  I can't explain that statement very well but I believe each of you will know what I mean when you reach that point.  I never shaved my head or had my hair clipped close to the scalp.  I've had a self/at home short short boy cut.  That occurred after my 2nd treatment and because I got annoyed with the hair being everywhere.  I made the 5 little pony tails and snipped those pony tails alone.  It was quite liberating and it controlled that hair being everywhere.  Yes, my hair has fallen out and I now a thin veil of hair all over my head.  I've scant wispy bangs and scant hair on the nape of my neck.  I decided before I had chemo that I would not be shaving my head since I wanted to see what the chemo regimen would actually do ( self science experiment) and felt that going from waist length hair to absolutely no hair was going to be a little too much for me.  I love how my head feels now with what hair I have, peach fuzz and some new stubbie growth.  My DH and DS rub my head and I tell them it's for good luck.  It is reassuring to know that those little stubborn hair follicles are trying to get on with growing hair despite that mean old chemo.   I have a free wig from the American Cancer Society Look Good Feel Good program and that poor little wig is having abandonment issues sitting in a zip loc bag.  I usually wear caps, bandanas, Buffs and straw fedora hats.  The wig just isn't me but the other head coverings are.  No matter what action you take, just remember that you are beautiful no matter what!!!!

Let's keep our fingers crossed that everyone's side effects will continue to be minimal.  My first one was the worst and since then, they were not as bad.  However, one never knows since the side effects are cumulative.  I did notice that my eyes are tearing more; but not surprised.  Taxotere is also called \" Taxo- tears\" for a reason.  I also noticed that my burping has gotten better too.  I had a bout of tongue sores but rinsed several times a day with 1/4 teaspoon salt + 1/4 teaspoon baking soda + 1 cup of warm water solution.  I made a new fresh cup of rinse every time I rinsed my mouth.  I do have this burned tongue sensation that starts a few days after the chemo and lasts for at least another week afterwards.  It also signals that my taste buds are on vacation.  The texture of foods change and there are foods that I don't like to put in my mouth during that time because of the thick greasy feeling I have.  The week before I have my next round of chemo, I feel much better and less fatigued.   I can tell you that the fatigue factor has gotten more obvious to me after each round of chemo.  I know it is partial from the chemo itself and my body's ability to recover is taking a little longer.  I know my onco is watching my red blood count since it has continued to decline with chemo.  Fortunately, one can help that with an iron enriched diet.  I stopped using my sonicare toothbrush until after I finish with my chemo.  I spoke to my dentist before starting chemo and he as well as my onco said to use a soft manual toothbrush to avoid any microcuts/microabrasions to my gums.  Just want to avoid any means of infections during chemo treatment.  For Those taking A/C on 3 week regimen- Please don't feel like there is something not right with having dose dense chemo.  I know of at least one gal on the boards who is receiving her A/C chemo every 3 weeks like you.  If you go the chemocare.com website (which is the website founded by Scott Hamiliton, the former Olympic ice skater and cancer survivor) and read about your chemo regimen, you will find that the nadir period for both of those drugs begin during the 2nd week after the infusion and the recovery period for both is 3 weeks.  Here are the 2 links http://www.chemocare.com/bio/adriamycin.asp http://www.chemocare.com/bio/cytoxan.asp You will have the opportunity to give your body the chance to recover in time for the next round and you won't be heading into that next dose dense chemo before your body has recovered.  Most dose dense receive Neulasta or Neupogan shots the day after their infusions and are told they will receive them before they even start their chemo.  Although I am not on the A/C regimen, I did not start getting a Neulasta shot until after my 2nd round of chemo.  I developed a spikey high fever and was told by my onco that I would thereafter receive a Neulasta shot to help prevent that situation from reoccuring.  My onco doesn't give the Neulasta shot unless the patient demonstrates the need for one.  Hope this helps, ladies!!!  Wishing easy times this week for those in the Big Girl Chair this week and minimal side effects!!!",

According to the clinical trial, one takes the Claritin (10 mg) once a day for 7 days beginning the day of the Neulasta treatment. I had my first Neulasta shot with my 3rd round of Cytoxan/Taxotere and took the Claritin.  I did not experience any bone pain.  The Claritin doesn't help everyone but it is worth a try since from my understanding the bone pain may be intense.  I'm now heading into my last chemo next week (6 of 6 rounds of Cytoxan/Taxotere) and no severe pain from the Neulasta shot that I have received since the 3rd round.  Just remember to ask your onco about trying the Claritin before you take it. I get my Neulasta shot in the tummy where there is some tummy fat.  In fact, I ask the nurse to give it to me there rather than in my arm.  It hurts less going in and I don't seem to have any post injection pain.  The nurse gives the shot to hold in my hand to warm it up before I receive the injection.  She then, slowly injects the shot which to help with injection pain. I've also read on the boards that you can take one Tylenol and one Motrin combo every 4-6 hours to help with the bone pain.  I do not take any Tylenol or Motrin or Advil after I get my chemo but I am cleared to take Tylenol or Advil by my onco.  Again, always ask your onco about what OTC pain meds you can take before you take any. Wishing minimal side effects for all!!!",

Please try to be easy on yourself and not be angry at yourself. Do yourself a big favor and do not consult with Dr. Google.

Do not hesitate to ask your doctors for anti-anxiety medications. If you feel you need them, ask for them. Give yourself breaks from the situation by distracting yourself.

Here is the link for Chemo info for newbies thread which is a great place to start get some helpful tips about getting through chemo, a shopping list for things to have on hand at home, wigs, and port info.   http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topic/785189?page=1#idx_1 You may want to read up on your chemo regimen by going to the BCO main website and looking up the individual chemo drugs that you will be infused with.  Here is the link for the chemo section: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy/ For additional info on the chemo drugs and side effects, you can also go to chemocare.com which is website founded by Scott Hamilton, the former Olympic ice skater and cancer survivor link: http://www.chemocare.com/ .  The Oncolink website (Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania) is also helpful- http://www.oncolink.org/index_ie.cfm I was given a copy of the cookbook, Eating Well Through Cancer by Holly Clegg and Gerald Miletello, MD by the hospital cancer center where I'm being treated.  This book was a great help to me since it explained what I should eat the days leading up to chemo, what to eat after chemo, what to eat if I had certain side effects and shopping lists/pantry lists.  It just helped having something readily available to me and didn't require me to log on to the computer and search for some quick help.  I also bought a cookbook, the Cancer Fighting Kitchen by Rebecca Katz which has some great recipes and pictures. Wishing you the best of luck!!!!  Just keep coming back to the chemo boards for support and help.  Hugs to you!!!",

As for the OTC medications to have on hand for constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, etc., that is your choice.  The shopping list for chemo newbies is helpful but you don't have to purchase everything on that list.  The list is to help you get organized and also helps you think about how to handle some of the chemo side effects.  I did purchase a lot of the items on that list but it also turned out that I didn't need most of them.  I felt like I wanted to have them on hand in the event I needed them rather than run to the drug store in a panic.  I also kept those items in a separate bin so I and my family would know where those items were.   I did make sure I purchased an extra thermometer and placed it in that bin since for some reason those things seem to disappear at my house. Just like your onco said, please try to refrain from getting info from Dr. Google.  There are some good sites out there for info (like this one) and then there are others not so good with not so current information.  As for being triple positive, it means that one can have in addition to chemo and radiation,  hormone therapy (ie Tamoxifen, Arimidex) and targeted therapy (ie Herceptin).  You read more on these therapies in the treatment section of BCO.org- here's the link: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/ I know it isn't easy to stay calm and not to get anxious about the upcoming chemotherapy.  If you are feeling really anxious and having trouble sleeping/eating, do not hesitate to call your onco to get some medication to help you.  You do have plenty of time to get prepared for chemo and for your next appointment with your onco.  You may want to write down questions to ask your onco at the next appointment so you won't forget to ask them.  By the way, what chemo regimen are you having?",

Decadron is an anti-nausea med so it will be in your system before you have the chemo round. Not everyone has a port put in.  If you want one, you may ask your onco if you can have one installed.  The Herceptin infusions are for one year and will continue after you finish chemo.  (I'm glad I have a port because my veins just bury themselves when they hear nurses coming!!) Hope you have calmed down a little.  HUGS!!!",

I fortunately was given two cook books that helped me through the 6 rounds of Cytoxan/Taxotere. The first book is Eating Well through Cancer by Gerald Miletello, MD and Holly Clegg and the second book is The Cancer Fighting Kitchen by Rebecca Katz. The first book has meal plans, recipes, shopping lists and helpful tips as to how to handle certain side effects; the second book had great pictures and recipes and helpful tips. I ate 5-6 small meals and tried to eat for nutritional purposes rather than for comfort. I ate rather bland meals the first two weeks after chemo. A few days after chemo, my taste buds would go on vacation and thankfully returned the beginning of week 3. I kept a food diary which helped keep me on track and also record what foods I handled the best when. I also found out that I could not tolerate butter and salt during chemo. Just didn't like the taste or feel in my mouth. I hope your favorite foods remain your favorite foods once you finish chemo. I am lucky that I gained very little weight during chemo and my taste buds returned with no problem. Wishing you the best!!!!!",

I hope you asked the onco to prescribe some EMLA cream (lidocaine cream) that you can apply an hour before you go in for a round of chemo.  The EMLA cream will help numb the area so you won't feel the poke.  Most likely, you will need to wait to use the EMLA cream after the port suture has healed a little since EMLA cream can't be used on newly sutured skin.",

Drains- Drains are one of those necessary post surgical things that people find troublesome.  Before your friend is discharged from the hospital, make sure she is given written instructions for \"stripping the drain line\" and how to care for the drain and that she is shown how to care for the drain.  It is not a difficult process and very doable.  Usually, the drain needs to be emptied several times a day and the amounts recorded in the log.  This info will help the surgeon determine when the drain should be removed.  One of the most discussed things about drains is a drain holder.  One can use different things as a drain holder -- the drain can be safety pinned to clothing, the drain can be placed in a fanny pack or small purse with a long strap, an id neck cord or purchase a special drain holder or camisole with removable drain holders.  I opted to purchase from Target for $29.99 front zip Champion athletic jackets that had inside pockets.  Lymph Node Biopsy- You won't know the extent of that procedure until the surgeon removes and examines the nodes during the surgery.  Like Chrissy said, one is sore after that. Post Op care - I would think how much attention your friend will need post surgery will be dependent upon how long she stays in the hospital and the extent of her surgery.  I know that I was instructed as well as given written instructions on how to care for myself after I was released from the hospital.  I also asked a lot of questions of the nurses and surgeon as to what I should do and did not wait for someone to tell me.  One should also be mindful of other post op side effects such as constipation, nausea and diarrhea.  I avoided constipation problems by drinking prune juice/apple juice and eating Sunsweet Ones individually packaged prunes.  As for nausea, I was given a motion sickness patch behind my ear when I was being prepped for surgery.  I did not experience any nausea post op. Chemo & Radiation - I get the feeling you want to prepare yourself and your wife as to how to care for your friend as she moves forward with her treatment plan.  Read the BCO main sections first and as your friend continues to heal and approach each new phase of the treatment, she/you should visit the individual forums (Chemotherapy/Radiation) so all can learn from the personal experiences of others and also get great support. Herceptin- I'd read the BCO section on Herceptin so you will understand that being HER2+ means a patient has one more weapon in her arsenal to fight cancer.  I'm currently in a Herceptin clinical trial and would not be receiving Herceptin as a standard chemo protocal but for this trial. Wishing you all the best of luck and glad to know there are such wonderful and kind people willing to help a friend in need.  Positive healing and calming prayers, thoughts and energy!!!",

I was also given a copy of a book \"Eating Well Through Cancer\" by Holly Clegg and Gerald Miletello, M.D.  That cookbook has easy recipes and recommendations during and after treatment, menus, shopping lists, etc and just made my life easier.  The book has taken the guesswork out of what to eat when I'm dealing with side effects.

As for what to ask the surgeon, here is a link to the main BCO website \"Questions To Ask Your Surgeon About Mastectomy:  http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/mastectomy/questions.  The BCO.org website is a good source of information to help answer a lot of your questions that you may have. As to order of physicians, it is personal choice.  My oncologist led the way for my mastectomy and everything else (chemo/the no rads decision).  She is the one who recommended the second breast surgeon I had since that breast surgeon was more experienced than the first and one that she works with on a regular basis.  The second breast surgeon only does breast surgeries whereas the first one I had did other types of surgeries.  At the time I met with my oncologist, the pathology report of my lumpectomy was not totally in but enough was in that she knew what my tentative treatment plan would be.   If you feel more comfortable seeing an oncologist first, then do so.  As for the pathology report, those identifiers will be revealed once what is removed is analyzed and examined by the pathologist.  The breast surgeon removes the cancer and the pathologist analyzes what is removed. As for not having a recent mammogram.... try not to focus on what she hasn't done but simply what she is now doing.  We can't go back and look at the what-if's and just really need to focus in a positive way about moving forward.  The oncologist may order additional tests such as a PET scan, CT scan to help determine if there are other places in the body that the cancer may be.  These tests will help give the oncologist more information in formulating your Mom's treatment plan. Sending you and your Mom and your family, lots of HUGS and positive calming and healing prayers, thoughts and energy.  I know there will be times of emotional ups and downs ahead and patience may be hard to find at times.  It is one day at a time, one step at a time.......",

I had a prescription for Latisse but never filled it.  My bottom eyelashes and eyebrows started to fall out around round 4 and were gone right after round 6.  They did grow back within 4 weeks after round 6.  Lashes and brows can fall out after one finishes all of the chemo and may fall out several times during the first year.  The lashes and brows are on a different growth cycle than the head hair is.  I've read that some use the Latisse throughout the chemo and some have waited until finishing chemo.  You may want to ask your onco what he/she thinks.   I didn't use the cold caps and just let my hair go.  I wanted to see exactly what the chemo was going to do to my hair.  It didn't all fall out; I was left a very thin veil of hair.  At 4 months PFC, I now have a very short short boy hair cut.  Some people have even asked me where I had my hair cut.... lol.  I tell them I had the most expensive hair cut and skin exfoiliation treatment that I've ever had!!!! Wishing you the best and always post if you have more questions.  You can even private message me if you want.  ",

FOR THOSE ICING NAILS DURING TAXOTERE INFUSION: Always clear anything you want to do with your oncos.  You will need to clear it with your onco about icing since not all oncos will allow icing during the Taxotere infusion.  At the suggestion of my onco, I am using clear nail polish on my nails to help keep them strong and also icing the nails to help prevent nail damage which is a side effect of Taxotere.  She suggested that use Sally Hansen Strong As Nails Clear Polish but I switched to Essie polish since it doesn't chip as much as the Sally Hansen brand.  Essie polish costs more but for someone like me who never used nail polish before chemo, the fewer times I have to apply polish the better.  I don't mani/pedis but some do.  I'd rather avoid the germ issue at nail salons and taking of a chance of getting nicked.  ICING : Process- I let the infusion nurse know that i'm icing so we can coordinate when I should start the icing. Once I know when I'm going to start the infusion, I put the ice bags in the bottom of the Neoprene bags.  I put the ones on my feet first and adjust the ice bags so my toes nails are covered.  I then put the ones on my hands on and adjust the ice to cover my fingernails.  My husband helps me with this process. GOOD  LUCK!!!!!!",

Go to the BCO.org section on Radiation http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/radiation to read up on rads. It is fine to read/educate yourself on the next phase of treatment but again try not to overwhelm yourself.  It is one step at a time; one day at a time.",

There is some discussion about whether to wear a hand glove or gauntlet when wearing a sleeve on the Step Up Speak Out Organization website. The rationale for wearing the hand gauntlet with the sleeve is to help prevent the possible fluid buildup in the hand/fingers that may occur from wearing only a sleeve. As you will discover, deciding whether to wear a sleeve/hand gauntlet/hand glove is very personal choice. Safe travels.  ",

What Leaf said to you is true.  One does always want to know what the possibilities are if the diagnosis is breast cancer.  If it is, you can educate yourself with just enough knowledge so you know what would happen.  However, just a word of caution that you don't go too far and get too ahead of yourself.  What does this mean... if you want to read up on  breast cancer and treatments in general, go to BCO.org main website and read up there.    You will find good information and questions to ask your doctors.   Once you and your doctors know more information about your situation and a plan of treatment is formulated, then you will feel a little calmer about things.

Also, I am curious as to whether you know about icing your nails to help prevent nail damage from the chemo.  If you aren't, let me know and I can post some info for you as to how to do this.",

Please do not think it is a sign of weakness to ask for some anti-anxiety meds; you have a lot happening and may need some calm. I know it may feel like everything is happening so fast and somewhat overwhelming. Hang in there..... the initial phase of fact finding and testing is not easy but keep pushing forward. I hope you have someone going with you to your appointments and tests. It is wonderful to have that emotional support with you plus an extra set of ears to hear what the doctors are saying to you. As i recall, I remember seeing the doctors move their lips and heard them say words but some of the things they were telling me I just couldn't comprehend. It was like they were speaking a different language. Sending (((HUGS))) and lots of peace and calm. Keep us posted. We are here for you.......",

Take care of yourself and try not to be super duper Super Woman/Mom while on chemo.  Yes, you can be Super Woman/Mom but your body will let you know that you have done too much if you try to do everything yourself.  Don't hesitate to ask for help from family and friends.  Continue to eat well and rest whenever you can.  After the first round of chemo, you will have an idea of how you may feel after each round of chemo.  Wishing you the best with your upcoming chemo.   HUGS!!!!",

Each of you probably have busy households and need lots of energy and calmness to move forward. It is good to have your spouse/significant other go with you to your appointments. Sometimes one does not hear everything during this appointments. it just helps to have another set of ears to hear what the doctors are telling you and also to give you much needed support. Take a note pad with you to write down notes during your appointments. Ask for copies of your reports and test results and keep those in a file folder so you can keep track of that information. You may want to jot down questions on that note pad before you go to the appointment so you can ask the doctors any questions that have come to mind. If you don't understand something that is discussed during one of your appointments, ask the doctor to explain it until you understand. I know what you are going through is not easy and at times hard to comprehend and accept. Hang in there. Wishing each of you the best . Sending many hugs, peace and calm as you move forward.",

Because of the large size of the removed cyst, a masectomy was the best way and probably the only way to get clean margins.  I did not have any recon because I developed a breast infection in the left breast (the problem breast).  It was a blessing in disguise that I didn't have to make a decision about recon since at that time, I was overwhelmed with everything.  You might want to ask the surgeon about your surgical and reconstruction options and recovery period.  Sending you lots of hugs and positive, calming and healing prayers, thoughts and energy.  As everyone will tell you here, you are not alone. ",

You can also pin those drains to any shirt/top you are wearing.  You can ask the nursing staff to give you some while you are in the hospital.  they usually pin the drains to your hospital gown. If you are allowed to take a shower after surgery ( I wasn't allowed), you can use one of those ID Badge lanyards to hold the drains. Regular clothing:  Front button down shirts are the easiest to get in and out of.  Finding them is sometimes a problem.  If you can't find any in the women's dept, go to the men's dept.  No over the head clothing during your initial recovery b/c your doctor may not allow it and you will find that it may be too painful to do so.  I usually wear athletic clothing while I'm lounging at home because they are easy to get on and off.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.  Happy shopping!!!",

Glad you found this website and posted. I know you probably thought as I did, what the heck and how did I end up here. There are no real answers for some events in our lives..... just that things happen and we just have to try to do our best. As for deciding what surgery to have, that is such a personal decision and not an easy one to make. I consulted with 2 breast surgeons and an oncologist before my unilateral mastectomy ( UMX) and was told the same thing..a UMX best for me and that I didn't need to have my healthy breast removed. I had a lumpectomy aka chunkectomy which removed the inital BC and had the UMX to get clean margins and to get other possible problem areas in that breast which were discovered during the MRI I had a week or two before my UMX surgery. I was also told during one of my oncologist appointments that radiation would probably be necessary even with a mastectomy. A final decision for for radiation was made post surgery and towards the end of of chemo rounds. My medical case went before the hospital tumor board several times during my active treatment. I did not have any reconstructive surgery and don't plan to have any . The decision to have or not have reconstructive surgery is not easy....just as difficult as deciding which initial surgery to have. For me, I did a lot of soul searching and thinking about my age (56 1/2 yrs at diagnosis), how I felt about my outward appearance and how I might feel about my body after surgery. and what I was willing to physically withstand. Try to remember that your decision will be the best one for you and only you since everyone is unique and different physically, emotionally and spiritually. Wishing you the best and hope you find some calm and peace.",

My chemo is tentatively set to start on Tuesday April 24 assuming all of the tests coming up this week go fine.  I will not receive the Neulasta shot right after the first treatment because the oncologist wants to see my SE's are.  As everyone has told me, prepare for the worst and hope for the best.  I've made some forms to keep up with my blood counts and daily side effects so I can keep track of things plus shopped for this trip to chemoland.  So I am ready.  I'm on two other April chemo threads so I'm travelling with a group of gals.  I plan to update my profile this coming week.  Again, you gals are the best chemo thread!!!!!!!!  Thanks and I will keep reporting back here with updates on my progress. ",

( no evidence of disease).  Yes, what Holeinone told you is true..... If one is triple negative, at this time there are no additional hormone target therapies ( ie Tamoxifen or Arimidex).   No matter what it will always be your own choice to decide whether or not to continue with treatment.    I agree with Holeinone about getting a second opinion and perhaps having an discussion with your onco as to his recommendation for the 3 remaining rounds of chemo and ask the questions as to what factors have been considered in determining your treatment plan.  The other thing to know is that there are some here who do have neoadjuvent chemotherapy, surgery and then additional chemotherapy so don't think that your treatment plan is unusual.  Wishing you the best and keep us posted.",

I'm now almost 6 weeks PFC and my hair is making a comeback!!!!  I have fuzz plus regular hair now!!!  The regular hair is still super short, at least 1/4 inch  plus more sprouting everyday.  The eyebrows and eyelashes that fell out towards the end of my chemo have started to come back too!!!!  Believe it or not, I still have some of pre-chemo hair.... not much but those hairs are just mighty.   I started taking Tamox about a week ago and haven't had any major side effects.  Have #8 of 17 Herceptin only infusion coming up next Tuesday.  Just so glad that I'm now what I call maintenance ( Tamox & Herceptin) and continuing to recover from the last 6-7 months.  Again, congrats on finishing with rads!!!!  Have a great trip to Tanzania and safe travels.    Hope to see you post on the Living Life Hang Out.  Here is the link:  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/7/topic/789387?page=8#idx_233 ",

I'd be crying too if I'd had been poked so many times for the nurses to find a vein.  I have a port thank goodness because my veins just hear those nurses coming and they bury themselves deep!!!  This past Tuesday, the infusion nurse had to do quite of bit of port flushing and getting me to move around to get my port going again.    Sorry about your father in law.....

Yesterday was not a good day for me.  I woke at 4:30 am from a dream that I had a fever.  Yep, I really did have a fever around 99.5.  So I took some tylenol and kept taking my temperature to see if it would go down.  Unfortunately, it didn't stay down.  I went back to bed and go up around 8 am so i could eat breakfast and take more tylenol.  Got the chills and then the fever started spiking up past the 100 mark.  Called my onco and she told me not to worry and she called in some anitbotics for me.  After I finally got the right ones (I'm allergic to penicillan), I took them and the fever dropped.  I\"m at the end of the 2 week mark after the latest infusion which means my WBC is at its lowest point.  So today, I feel fine and hope with the help of the antibotics and taking care of myself this coming week, my blood counts will be recover enough to have my next chemo on next Tuesday (June 5).  Just glad my onco didn't tell me to go to the ER--- I've visited the ER on a Sunday after my UMX surgery and it was not fun at all.  All I could think about while I was there is that I was in a germ incubator and didn't want to sit close to anyone. Stayshiny- I fulfilled my hot dog craving last week.  I normally don't ever eat them but gosh the hot dog lunch was so tasty!!! Janie - Sorry your 3rd treatment got you!!!!  Glad to hear you are on the mend!!! onvacation - Hope things are calming down for you!!!  I know you have your infusion this week so I hope you have stayed well!!!! For everyone who has just finished- Happy Dance!!!! For those almost finished - YAY!!!!!  For everyone who has more treatments - We are getting through this---- it isn't we can do this---- we are!!!! As always, minimal side effects for all and a great day!!!!",

I always felt awkward having lunch with them when they talked and complained about menopause.  I never had anything to add to the conversation since I wasn't there yet. Lezza13- right after the #2 round, I ate cheese sticks, small chicken sandwiches, a scrambled egg anytime I wanted and mac n cheese.  My husband got baked chicken from Whole Foods and I would slice off chicken to make myself a quick half sandwich.  I'd eat a few almonds,and walnuts when the mood hit me.   I eat bananas, blue berries and oranges everyday.   I found that just eating soup wasn't enough for me so I decided to stick with foods that would keep me fuller.  My WBC counts are good so I can eat just about anything ( no raw shushi)  I also eat sherbet when I want something really cold.  Basically, i eat a lot of little meals and try to not think about how everything tastes.  I can tell when the taste buds are going but I just eat whether I like the taste or not. It definitely is a mind over matter thing when it comes to food. I've got a few cancer cookbooks that have helped me figure out what to eat and when to eat what if and when I have side effects.  The pictures in one of the books are great which always gives me ideas of what I might want to eat. I've also bought a few food magazines just for the pictures in hopes that these things will stimulate my interest in eating.  Weird, right....?  No rain here yet but wish it would!!!

Karmil710- My pathology report from my first surgery, a lumpectomy which was really a chunk-ectomy (partial masectomy) stated that the HER2 was a +1.  Score of 0 and +1 in the HER2 are considered negative.  My oncologist is the one who explained the HER2 score and also told me about the clinical trial.  Her research coordinator answered my questions about the clinical trial and let me know that at any point in time, I can drop out of the trial.  I am on the BCO thread for the Herceptin B-47 clinical trial but not much action.  This trial started in January 2012 so it is fairly new.",

I just found out that I will be one of the Herceptin B-47 clinical trial to receive the Herceptin.  I will receive it starting next week with my chemo and will do so every three weeks until I have taken the Herceptin for one calendar year.  My oncologist and her staff are pretty excited about it since I'm sure it makes their participation in the national study a lot more interesting.  I look at it as making a very small contribution to breast cancer treatment research and hope it helps future treatments. I have one more test to take-- PET scan which is this Thursday afternoon.  I am praying and hoping there isn't any other sign of cancer in me.  I was supposed to have it this past Monday but the insurance refused to pay.  It got resolved today after a phone call from my oncologist.  My echocardiogram results came back good and the blood work just showed elevated cholestral.  I guess I've eaten too many egg and bacon breakfasts the last month in hopes of putting on some of the 14 pounds I've lost since February.  So it's back to my usual oatmeal which and whatever else that one should eat and exercise to prevent high cholesteral numbers.  A year ago, I had normal cholesteral numbers and eating the oatmeal regularly and a lot more active than I have been the last few months.  Easy fix-- no biggie. Each of you are constant reminders that I can do this and move forward.  Thanks again for sharing all the good and not so good experiences.  I know I am ready.",

My mouth got funky after my first infusion and I started doing the baking soda(1/4 tsp)/salt(1/4 tsp)/water (1 cup)  rinse after every time I ate.  It really helped.  Hope you have a good day!!!!

I would take a nap whenever I could.   As for the steroids, if I remember correctly, I think I had to take them twice a day..... one in the morning and one in the evening.  I would take the morning one with breakfast as early as I could so I would take the evening steroid as early in the evening as I could ( 12 hours between the doses).   If you are still struggling to get some sleep, you may want to chat with your onco.  Hope the sleep fairy finds you soon!!!",

Everyone reacts differently to chemo and so it is hard to predict what side effects you may experience. Hopefully your side effects are minimal and manageable. You may want to check out these 2 cook books that I used while in chemoland. The first is \"Eating Well Through Cancer\" by Gerald Miletello, MD and Holly Clegg. This book has recipes and helpful tips about how to handle certain side effects . The second is \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen\" by Rebecca Katz. That book has tips and recipes. FYI-Rebecca Katz has a Facebook page and website. You can also visit the Chemo section of the BCO Discussion forum and check out some of the threads on Cytoxan/Taxotere. Here is a link to one of them: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/69/topics... I know it is not easy to wrap your head around all of the information that you want to know at once. Too much info at once can become overwhelming.Sending you peace and calm as you prepare for your adventure in chemoland. Melrose",

The part of the pathology report that has the estrogen, progestrogen, HER2 was released after that. I went to see an oncologist to tell me about the particulars of my pathology report before I went to see the BS for a followup visit after the biopsy.  He was out of town the week that the full pathology report became available and I didn't want to wait two weeks after my biopsy to go over the results with him  Sending you positive thoughts and hugs.",

I took my anti-nausea drugs like a good little girl and never had any nausea issues.  I figured that my onco and infusion nurses had way more experience with chemo and know the first line of prevention for nausea are those anti-nausea drugs.  That is the main reason I took them plus I just don't like having that yuck feeling. 4.  As for diet, yes I made changes.  I ate small meals 5-6 times a day.  A fed tummy is happy tummy while on chemo.  Having food in the tummy helps prevent nausea.  I also was given a cancer cookbook called \"Eating Well Through Cancer\" written by Holly Clegg and Gerald Miletello, MD.  That book has chapters on what to eat before chemo, and what to eat when you have certain side effects (constipation, diarrhea, etc.)  It also has recipes and shopping lists which help take the guess work as to what to eat.  Since I'm participating in a clinical trial, I also maintained a daily diary of the foods I ate and the drugs I took.  It made it easier for me to figure out what I eat and ensured that I did eat and help me make sure I took in enough fluids.  I usually ate bland foods a few days after chemo--- my white meals of mashed potatoes/baked potatoes/ mac n cheese/ baked chicken/ baked fish. Just remember you don't have to super duper woman. you can be just super woman while going through chemo.  Hope this helps.",

Shirts- Finding button down shirts are not always easy to find in the women's dept.  Head to the men's dept for shirts if you can't find any you like in the women's dept.   Constipation- I have managed to not have this problem post op and during chemo.  I eat Sunsweet Ones (really moist individually wrapped prunes) and drink prune juice/apple juice.  I know the idea of prunes that usually comes to mind is yuck but they really do help.  I haven't had to take any OTC meds for this. Please go to the Surgery section of this forum for more tips and also refer back to the main information section of this site.  You may want to join the May 2012 thread and visit the March and April surgery threads to get more practical suggestions.  Wishing you the best.  You can also private message me if you want.  Always willing to help and support those on this journey as many have done for me!!!",

Heatherb8: After reviewing the data of a previous Herceptin clinical trial, researchers determined that some of the participants were not HER2 what I call true HER2 positive.  They were +1 which is considered negative.  The researchers found that some of the +1's benefitted from the Herceptin.  So the B-47 clinical trial purpose is to examine that aspect.  It is my understanding that  HER2 +1's do not receive Herceptin.  The trial is looking for 3000 participants.

Thanks to each of you for posting your SE's and leading the way for me.   Have a wonderful weekend!!!!!",

Ki-67 is a protein in cells that increases as they prepare to divide into new cells. A staining process can measure the percentage of tumor cells that are positive for Ki-67. The more positive cells there are, the more quickly they are dividing and forming new cells. In breast cancer, a result of less than 10% is considered low, 10-20% borderline, and high if over 20%.",

For everyone in general- Minimal side effects and have a wonderful week!!! Thanks for all of the kind words.  I'm getting a Neulasta shot next Wednesday after my #3 round on Tuesday. I'm planning to take claritin to help with the bone pain.   Just glad I can get the Neulasta shot to help prevent that spiking fever I had on Sunday even though the bone pain from it is no fun.  I knew that once that fever started to get over a 100 and started spiking upwards, I had to call my onco asap.  I'm on antibotics now and I feel pretty good.  Glad my energy level is up and able to keep moving.",

I got up out of bed and sat in my desk chair which seemed to help.  I also drank some really cold iced ginger ale which helped a lot.  I burped a lot and I mean a lot. I think I had heartburn but too tired, too druggy and not feeling well to figure that out.  I went back to bed after a few hours and woke up Friday morning feeling really groggy from the Activan I had during the infusion.  I was offered the Activan to help me keep calm so I said \"YES\".  No constipation or diarrhea---- just crazy burping.  The second infusion, I had less burping and felt tired on Saturday this time.  I also ate more protein (chicken, eggs) that time and kept my tummy fed and hydrated.  Started to lose my short bob hair on Day 15 after the 1st infusion.  That following weekend, I took the scissors to it after making 5 short pony tails to be used later if I want to make a hair halo.  There are instructions on the chemo forum somewhere.  My DH got his trusty electric clippers with a 1 inch guard and cut and cleaned up what I had done.  It was a very short short boy hair cut.  I have yet to shave my head bald since I am curious to see what hair (aka Elvis) goes and when.  I haven't lost any more hair in a week and heading into Round 3.  Since I am in the Herceptin B-47 clinical trial for HER2 (+1)'s, I have to document everything ( side effects, food, temperature) so I can provide as much info as I can to my onco and her research coordinator.  One big science project here.... lol I know it is amazing that so much has happened in a relatively short period of time.  I'm glad things keep moving forward for all of us!!!!  I used to say I can do this--- now I am doing this.",

I had the same chemo as you are having-- Cytoxan/Taxotere.   I would get my chemo on Tuesday.   I felt fine the first 36-48 hours after receiving my chemo.  On Friday, the 3rd day, I would start to feel the downhill slide.  I usually drank ginger ale and lots of water and rested as much as I could.  I would rest over the weekend and would feel okay by Monday. ",

As for eating, I tried to eat 5-6 small meals.  That way, I always had something in my tummy which made me less likely to experience nausea.  I also had two books to help me figure out what to eat and probably can be found on line at Amazon or Barnes & Noble Eating Well Through Cancer by Holly Clegg and Gerald Miletello MD ( has tips, how to deal with side effects, recipes, shopping lists, menus) The Cancer Fighting Kitchen by Rebecca Katz- ( tips and great pictures and recipes) As for the Neulasta shot, I had those beginning with my 3rd round of chemo.  I had the shot administered in my tummy since there was a little fat and not as painful as it would have been if I had received it in my arm.  I also took regular 24 hour Claritin the morning that I would receive my shot in the afternoon.  I continued to take it for 7 days which is the protocal for the current on going clinical trial on the taking of Claritin to help the bone pain from the Neulasta.  Just remember that your wife's type of chemo may also cause muscle aches and joint pains so one cannot always assume that the Neulasta is the culprit for aches and pains.  As for the hair, this is a very personal thing.  One does know that the hair will most likely go but until it actually begins to happen, the reality of the event can be upsetting.  It is the most outward evidence to others that one is not well.  We all have our hair stories here and we each dealt with the change.  I wore bandanas, Buffs, baseball caps, and straw hats purchased from Target.  I had a fee wig that I received through the American Cancer Society's Look Good Feel Good program which I decided not to wear because it was too hot.  You may want to check to see if there is an upcoming program for your wife to attend.  They also have a makeup session where one receives a free bag of makeup and can learn ways to tie head scarves. As the two of you travel through chemoland together, please continue to come back here for support and help.  Both of you are not alone and there are plenty of wonderful people here ready to help you.  Wishing you the best!!!",

I know it may seem like an inconvenience to travel to a major hospital with cancer center or a major cancer center, but you will find that the medical staffs are more willing to help schedule everything together and not have you drive back and forth.  At the hospital I am going through, it has a cancer cemter and oncology navigators to help introduce the patients to the cancer center and help patients get additional help with keeping track of their medical information, social services available and other things.  The staff makes an effort to welcome every patient/family that comes through the door feel comfortable  and know that they are there to help the patients.  Every time I have had schedule appts with several different doctors, efforts are made to have the appts all in one day.  I hoping you find a place like this because your mother,you and your family will benefit greatly from feeling comfortable with the medical team and the surroundsings. ",

You may want to start a notebook to help you keep track of the medical info that you are collecting as well as have a month to month calendar so you can write down your appointments for doctors and any additional tests.  Yes.... you  can ask for copies of any of your test results.  If you have time, make a lists of all of your doctors, closest 24 hour pharmacy, medications, prior surgeries/hospitalizations, food/drug/substance allergies.  You will find having all of this information handy will make it easier when you are filling out forms. You may also want to visit the main BCO.org section on Treatment and Side Effects.  Here is the link to that section and you can read up on what is a treatment plan and the components of a treatment plan ( Ie surgery, chemo, radiation, hormone therapy, etc.) http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment.

For the mouth blisters-- rinse your mouth several times a day with a solution of 1/4 teaspoon baking soda + 1/4 teaspoon salt + 1 cup of warm water. Make sure you make a fresh batch everytime you  rinse. For constipation- Sometimes the anti-nausea prescriptions (Zofran) can cause constipation.  You can try to eat foods that help prevent the constipation.  I ate for breakfast a bowl of rolled oat oatmeal plus banana, blueberries and wheat bran and milk.  I also ate a few Sunsweet Ones (which are individually wrapped prunes that are sweet and moist) after each meal.  When eating more foods with bulk, one needs to make sure to drink plenty of fluids. To help you figure out what to eat when dealing with certain side effects, you may want to check out these two books--- Eating Well Through Cancer by Holly Clegg and Gerald Miletello and The Cancer Fighting Kitchen by Rebecca Katz.  I have both of these books and found them extremely helpful.  The first book has great tips, food menus, shopping lists and recipes and is divided into what to eat before chemo, how to deal with certain side effects ( constipation, diarrhea, sore mouth etc.)  The Cancer Fighting Kitchen book had wonderful pictures and good recipes.  Again, these books were very handy to have on hand, especially when I needed some immediate information. As for the Neulasta bone pain, are you taking a regular 24 hour Claritin (OTC med) the day you receive your Neulasta shot and for 7 days afterwards?  The Claritin may help prevent the bone pain from the Neulasta shot.  There is an ongoing clinical trial about the taking of Claritin to help prevent the bone pain--- http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01311336?term=claritin+neulasta&rank=1 . Ask your onco about taking that.    I told my onco about the Claritin and how the clinical trial.  She gave me her approval to take it and fortunately, I didn't experience any bone pain.  At the same time, just remember that one can have muscle aches and joint pain from the chemo itself. Hope you feel better soon.  Keep us posted!!!!!",

I switched surgeons ( the first one did a lumpectomy) and have no regrets.  Another reason I switched surgeons was because the oncologist and the breast surgeon both work out of the the hospital system where my cancer center is.  It has made it easier for me to go to one medical complex with one hospital that has access to all of my medical records/tests.  It is one day at a time and one step at a time.  The waiting part in the beginning is hard and patience is hard to come by.  It feels like hurry up and wait.  Patience will become your friend as it has become mine.  When you do learn more information, please refrain from googling.  That is a lot of information out there and it will just overwhelm you.  Once the treatment plan is in place, your mom and you will feel better.  Wishing both of the you the best!!! Don't hesitate to keep coming back to the boards for help and a place to let out feelings. ",
