Well here's my story, and I welcome any input and guidance you can share. I met this amazing OB/GYN when checking why I had 3 bladder infections in one year. When she heard I was high risk for breast cancer she asked why.....I told her I had ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia) in both breast, she asked why I hadn't had prophylactic double mastectomy. I was somewhat surprised at her question and my response was that I'm being monitored and have been classified as a high risk patient. She continued to point out to me that the second breast lump that appeared in Sept. after my mammo in July, which detected ADH in right breast, but didn't show anything in left breast. Then all of a sudden I had a lump the size of a grape in the left breast. My surgeon at the time sent me for an ultrasound, I was told it was just scar tissue from previous lumpectomy 4 yrs earlier, so just leave it and monitor. Since I was going to be having the ADH removed from right breast in October, I requested that my surgeon take out the lump in left breast. Well it ended up the left breast lump was full of ADH as well. OB/GYN nicely said, \"And you're counting on early detection\". Next question OB/GYN asked or assumed was if I had genetic testing? Again, I had to answer, no. So I'm in process of seeing if I qualify for genetic testing, basically for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutated gene. Then she asked/assumed if I'm getting my moles checked regularly, again I answered, no. Just had app't with dermatologist who said I needed two moles removed, pathology report shows dysplastic nevus, basically a precancerous condition that increases my risk for melanoma. So my challenges are figuring out what's the next move. I go for my MRI/mammo Dec. 6th; have telephone consult to determine if I qualify for genetic testing; then will see OB/GYN for follow up on all data collected. My focus is to take one day at a time, collect data and then make an informed decision. Log in to post a reply",
