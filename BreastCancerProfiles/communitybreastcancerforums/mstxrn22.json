The radiologist read it on the spot and all in the same day she had the ultrasound and biopsy. So, she had the results by Thursday. Her appointment with the oncologist is Monday morning. I'm very glad this is moving so quickly. It's small (or so she's been told) at 7mm. She doesn't want to tell anyone herself, she just wants people to already know and to not treat her differently.  She told my sister, who told me, I told my brother, etc. I can't imagine how hard it is to make those words come out of your mouth...I have breast cancer. I came home from work yesterday after my sister had called me and just sobbed (and ate a whole pizza and a lot of ice cream!).  At this point, I'm not afraid of her losing her life, as I know this is so treatable. I don't want her to suffer or have pain. This is all so surreal. I think the whole family is still absorbing this news. In my head, I'm thinking (or hoping) the doctor will say lumpectomy and radiation. I don't think I'm even willing to think about mastectomy being an option for her, or her having to endure any chemo. I don't know if I should be scared or what. I do feel very sad. She says she will do whatever she has to do and is willing to go through whatever she has to to take care of this. She said last night was the first night she's slept all week. She's in good spirits so far, just is anxious to see the doctor on Monday to ask questions and find out what her options are. I'm in Texas, she's in Mississippi. She said my dad is being so nice to her it's sickening, but my sister is also there to support her. It tears me up that I'm so far away. I bought her some sappy card to send, but not sure if I should. She said someone gave her a brochure about \"it's okay to be angry\". She said she's not angry, so she thought that was silly because it's not like she's got inoperable brain cancer or anything that's threatening her life in the immediate future. Thanks for letting me let this all out. I suppose things will feel better once we have a definite plan of action and know the path we're going to take. Any words of advice or comfort would be appreciated... Also, for me and my sister...we are 33 and 31...when does this mean we should start having mammograms ourselves?  Log in to post a reply",

I cried more this weekend than I have in a long time, so my eyes are tired today. My fiance was out of town when I got the news, so that was hard, too...hearing the news without having him present for me. He's back now and all is well.  She had her first appointment with her oncologist today.  He says this should be just a blip in her life. He plans on doing a lumpectomy this Thursday and taking a couple of lymph nodes. If margins are clear and lymph nodes clean, then they will do 6 weeks of radiation. Glad to know it's coming out in just a few days. I'm mailing the sappy card today, Sherry, with a funny one to follow very soon. :-) My mom has always been my hero...just more so now than ever before.",
