    "Content": "sweetaerobabe wrote: It looks like I am probably gonna be having a bilateral mastomecty with SNB within the next couple of weeks, I would like some input about the drains. Honestly, I think that is scaring me the most. I read comments about \"stripping the drains\"? But I have no idea what that means. How much is involved in taking care of these drains? I will be meeting with a PS, but needing chemo and radiation, Im not sure yet what will be done, if anything at the time of surgery. I would greatly appreciate and tips, tricks and advice you lovely ladys can offer me.
