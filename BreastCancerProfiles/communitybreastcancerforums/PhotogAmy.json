Also, if I want to keep thee girls' lives somewhat normal, I don't want to turn the main living space of our home into a hospital.  Also we have 2 full bathrooms upstairs and just a half downstairs, so they would be easier to get to.  My husband and my mother are thinking I should be on the main level, and not be \"tucked away\" upstairs.  They are thinking it will be easier to see and help me there.   ALittleBitBritish, do you think you would have been as comfy there with all that going on, or is it relatively quiet at your house? ",

I can turn our master bathroom into the draining station and leave the other 2 BR's for family and guests. I am hoping I won't need it very long, too. But while I need it, it'll be nice to have my own space. Even if it turns out I'd rather be downstairs, I can always change it later. I'd rather be in a quiet room wishing I was downstairs, than downstairs in all the noise, wishing I was upstairs! Thank you all!",

I am having an electric recliner delivered tomorrow and I was wondering if anyone has heard whether it is better for me park myself on he main level of the house with everyone else or put it in our bedroom.    We live in a condo and the main level has an open LR/DR and that's it other than the kitchen, bathroom and laundry.  So, being on the main level means being right were everyone else is. I'm wondering if I would be in the midst of too much daily noise (we have 2 little girls turning 5 & 7), or if it would be better so I can be near everyone, especially when people come to visit.    The kids will be partly in school, out with friends, or sleeping.  We also have a finished playroom in the basement and and they are old enough to find and do quiet activities when asked.  But, if I will want/need to sleep all the time maybe I should let them have the main level and put myself in my bedroom.   Any advice?
