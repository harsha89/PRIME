He wanted me to continue now with 4 Taxol rather than operating at this time since he thinks the tumor can shrink some more with the Taxol. I'll be having surgery in November it looks like. I asked about my survival expectations and he said somewhere less than 50% over ten years due to lymph node involvement and the original size of the tumor. That didn't please me too much but a lot can happen in 10 years research-wise and I could be one of the 47% or so who do survive. Also, I am ER positive so I'll be treated with estrogen inhibitors for several years after radiation. We discussed removing one breast or two and said it would be up to me but that an MRI would tell us more if anything is happening in the \"good\" breast. That blister I have on my chest didn't seem to be anything to worry about. You know how it is. Anything can cause concern when you have bc.

I finally heard from the onc and the news sucks!  Twenty-one of 21 nodes were positive.  Everyone was surprised since the tumor shrunk so nicely.  The cancer in the nodes did not respond.  The hospital tumor board is meeting on Tuesday to discuss treatment options - radiation or radiation and oral chemo (Xeloda I think).  There was cancer in 3 of 4 quadrants of my right breast which the MRI did not pick up for some reason but the bs thinks he got all of that.  I don't know how they'll monitor for spread to other areas now that those nodes have been active all of this time. I'm very upset since I believed the chemo was shrinking the nodes too.  I feel like I did at the beginning of this trip - very frightened.  Even worse, I feel like I went through a lot for I'm not sure what?  I know I'll settle in to some kind of rationalization eventually but for now I cry every time I think about this mess.

Finally, a volunteer called me after about 5 weeks of my calling and left a number where I was unable to leave a message. After 3 more calls to the hospital social worker who referred me to the program, the volunteer called back and spoke with me for about 15 minutes. I said I wanted to speak with her further. She said sure and she'd call back the next week and never did. I was wondering if any of you out there have had similar experiences. I was in a crisis early on (in June) and really needed to reach out to someone who had been through the ordeal and lived to talk about it. As a former mental health professional, I can say that this is totally unacceptable. When someone who is vulnerable makes repeated attempts to get help which are ignored, something's very wrong with the system. I have informed the social workers at the hospital about all of this. If it happened to me, I suspect I'm not the only one. Dx 5/23/2007, IBC, 6cm+, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 21/21 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Happy, healthy new year, everyone.",
