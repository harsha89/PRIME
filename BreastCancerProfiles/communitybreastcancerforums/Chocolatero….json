So that is how I based my decision- I only want to do this once. 2nd- I want to be normal and put this behind me and now have it drag on for ever. I looked into multiple methods and found that since I had a c sect some were off the table. Looked into moving the fat around with outsider expanders but the thought of general anthes 5 times is to much... So I went out of my area to doctors who do skin sparing and nipple sparing. I am a size 36 A and I was looking for replacement versus sizing up. So  the 1 step is only up to size c and skin has to be in good condition (not sure how they assess this). anyway it was a 5 hour operation with alloderm to hold the implants and silicone to create the new breasts. The doc told me that if cancer was close to the nipple (they would take the nipple). The chest muscles are cut and that is what hurts, the incisions are underneath and there a 4 drains... does that help- take care",

Diabetes drug metformin could help lower breast cancer risk Wed, 30 Nov 2011  A new study from South Korea has found that the diabetes drug metformin could help to reduce the risk of diabetes-associated cancers, such as breast cancer. The research offers further evidence supporting such benefits of long-term treatment by metformin, which is taken by patients with type 2 diabetes and helps to prevent cardiovascular complications. The team examined if cancers originate from adult stem cells and how many types of chemicals can enhance the growth of breast cancer cells, by growing miniature human breast tumours, called mammospheres, in culture dishes. This activated a stem cell gene, before the mammospheres were exposed to both natural oestrogen and man-made chemicals that can promote tumours or cause problems for the endocrine system. The oestrogen and chemicals resulted in the mammospheres increasing until the introduction of metformin, which radically lowered the amount and size of the mammospheres. Study leader James Trosko, from Seoul National University, commented \"People with Type-2 diabetes are known to be at high risk for several diabetes-associated cancers, such as breast, liver and pancreatic cancers.\" He added \"Though we still do not know the exact molecular mechanism by which it works, metformin seems to dramatically affect how oestrogen and endocrine-disrupting chemicals cause the pre-existing breast cancers to grow.\"  ",

If you are in part of the country that is cold you don't have to worry about appearance at this time- I am sure you will look fine.  I am sorry that your mom died so early and yet you have the courage to go on. The surgery  will probably ensure that you will live a long happy healthy live without worry. Your ca is so small with no nodes so it looks really promising.  As time goes on you will figure out whether you want additional surgery or are happy with your self as is. But for now you have  a family and you are recuperating. In a few short weeks you will be out and about going back to your pre-c life raising a child which is amazing. Back to school and work- rest while you can.  Take it one day at a time- enjoy your life. It will be great. Peace. CR",

Good luck I did drive myself home and did go to work the next day and used ice for a couple of hours take care!",

My mom who is alive and a breast cancer survivor for 16 plus years had the following. Two cancers- one invasive ductal and the other a spindel cell carninoma- highly aggressive cancer  (was considered maybe fatal) plus other lcis....Treated with a unilateral mx and chemo of the 90's. Today 16  years later she still takes evista and remains NED. So I guess the theory is that a bad cell could find a home. Interestingly, my 2nd opinion MO (super specialist) indicated that with my own stage 1.... if I could not handle the hormonals I could have my ovaries out and that would be good enough- I just started fareston leaving tami... My own MO disagreed and would like me on medication for as long as possible... So my conclusion is they don't know, and the tests cannot detect anything until its to late (reoccurance) so we are all a work in progress. Hope this makes sense. Chocolate",
