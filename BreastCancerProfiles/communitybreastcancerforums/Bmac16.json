I feel like I did when I went through the first round of chemo, waiting for something \"bad\" to happen LOL! Going to look for \"supportive\" camisoles this weekend. I started back at work part time this week and no bra isn't an option.",

Breast was totally fried and I was concerned about the scar under my arm from lymph node removal. RO told me to keep using the lotions/cream for 2 weeks and all would be good. She was right, 2 weeks to the day, everything looks great.",

I'm also dreading how bad this may be as I'm very light skinned. I hadn't heard large breasted women get a larger dose. Not good news for me. I have been using an aloe product twice a day and so far so good.",

The only place it is sore is under my arm around the area my lymph nodes were removed back in December. So far no blisters but the RO recommended neosporin as well as the aloe gel just in case. She said although radiation is over, my skin will get worse before it gets better. I'm so happy to be done with 24 weeks of chemo and 6 weeks of radiation, to all of you still going through this, you can do it!!",

I will see what this week brings.",
