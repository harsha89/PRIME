I have had constant pain in this breast since july 2017. Doc has given me tamoxifen and said wants to try shrink it as very tiny and any surgery would lead to radiotherapy. So we will see how this goes as back in 6 weeks. As i said I get constant pain in this breast and maybe 3 weeks ago its was into my ribs and on my back.. right behind the breast. Very tender to touch. I spoke to him and he said it was unrelated chest wall pain. Anyway the last few days the pain as been really bad and have jusy noticed a huge bruise on this side. I havent injured myself at all. Anyone wonder of this is all related. I dont want to see like a drama queen and keep harrassing him but im getting scared now. Log in to post a reply",
