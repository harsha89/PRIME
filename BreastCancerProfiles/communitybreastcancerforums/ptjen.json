I have never liked short hair and figured I should give myself a chance to get used to it. Turns out, I love it. It is so easy to take care of - so I may keep it short after it grows back. My hair is basically white and has been for years (I found my first gray hairs in high school) so I figured there was no way it would come back in any unexpected color as we are warned. I don't know where the hair follicles would find any color! But my hairdresser said that it could still grow in with some color. That would be neat even if it's temporary.  Fimi: I'm sorry about your bone pain. This is my 4th day out too and I've been feeling aches and pains in my legs all day. I wasn't sure if it was from the Neulasta or just general aches. I decided to take Tylenol - it will hopefully help either cause. btw...my understanding is that it takes about two weeks for hair to fall out after TC starts. I asked my onco if it was 100% that it would fall out and she said that until recently she would have said yes, but she has one patient who didn't lose her hair - she doesn't know why.  Colleen:  Lainey's suggestion is a good one - but I wonder who is co-ordinating the people who are sending food. Perhaps a word to that wonderful person would help.  For all of you who are going through this at the same time you have to deal with peri-menopause, I am so sorry. But please take care of yourselves. Your hormones will play havoc with your emotional well-being and if there was ever a time when you need to be the one in charge, this is it. If you need help, please talk to your doctor. I waited too long when I was dealing with it (several years ago) and really paid for it. Please - take care of yourself!",

I've been reading a book entitled \" What Helped Me Get Through\" and there is advice from an oncologist who said that in 20 years of working with people, the ones that did the best were the people who made sleep a priority. I have always had sleep problems but I am trying to make sure I get my rest right now. But it's really hard if your body won't listen! If the pain has subsided for this shot, can I expect to be done with it until the next? P.S. Check to see if there are books, magazines, etc. at the hospital for you to take out. The American Cancer Society drops off books at the local hospital cancer center and you can just take them and return them when you're done. The one I'm reading is from them.",

My onco said I was on the tipping point of either and I really wanted that potential 2% benefit offered by the AC/T. I had a last conversation with her just before my tx and I couldn't believe I was actually saying I was going to have the TC. I felt like I was chickening out and was going to regret it. Actually, the opposite has happened. It now seems like it should have been an easy call.

I really wanted that extra 2% benefit the more aggressive treatment gave, but it was at too high a cost (cardiotoxicity). So I started the TC and two days later, so far so good. The tips for starting chemo have been incredibly helpful and I highly recommend anyone about to start to check those two discussions out. I do have a question though - I am very tired but sleep is NOT coming. I lay in bed tired as anything, but I am not sleeping. I went into this with almost no sleep the two nights before chemo but I understood that - I was still researching and preparing and stressing for chemo since I didn't have to decide which I would have until the day of. Now that the stress of the decision and the unknown of the first treatment is over, I don't understand why sleep is so hard to come by. I know I can call my doctor and get something for it, but there is already so much stuff in my body, I hate to add another.  Any thoughts?",

I know SE's will be cumulative but it was all manageable this time. Glad I had the Zofran and Imodium. And my Dana Farber oncologist and chemo nurse were wonderful! I had an incredible Friday. I've been avoiding dealing with the prosthesis - but the cost of seeing the woman at the hospital (this was at my local hospital in Maine), who was keeper of an incredible selection of hats and scarves, was also having a prosthesis consult. So I went today and had a wonderful friend that I don't see enough of come with me and we had a ball. The hat/scarf woman didn't even let me tell her what I liked - she just showed me everything! Then she proceeded to urge me to explore outside my comfort zone. I came home with a collection of absolutely beautiful hats and scarves that I am looking forward to playing with. The real surprise was finding a prosthesis (which I actually did before I got to see the head stuff). We did the insurance paperwork then she showed me all sorts of bras. I was astounded at how beautiful alot of them are.  She measured me and then had me try on the bras we'd selected. Then she brought a prosthesis out one at a time to get a good fit. After each one, she had me put on a light robe and had me look in the full length mirror. The fourth one was it. I looked in the mirror and totally unexpectedly, started to cry. I never saw it coming. I hadn't realized it was an issue. Before my surgery (mastectomy), I just saw my breast as my enemy. I wanted the cancer gone. After the surgery, it was just this ugly, uncomfortable place that I had to keep clean and put antibiotic ointment on. I hadn't realized that this 58 year old, overweight, gray-haired lady was even thinking about it. I'd been wearing zip up athletic jackets and loose pants, flat shoes (b/c I just didn't feel solid in my usual higher shoes). Turns out the prosthesis doesn't just make your clothes fit better (they do!) but it balances you and keeps your shoulders aligned.  I had also assumed that the insurance company would only pay for one and if I got it too soon I'd need another that I'd have to pay for (b/c I've so totally changed my diet that I am losing weight and I always lose weight in my boobs too). But I found out that if you have insurance coverage, they cover another prosthesis if your size changes b/c of weight. They also have ALOT of donated ones for people who don't have insurance.  I guess the thing I wanted to let everyone know was that I HAD FUN! I still can't believe I am saying this. That shopping for a prosthesis and hats and scarves for when I lose my hair would be - or even could be - fun. But it was. Alot. ",

I plan on getting a bunch of \"cancer sucks\" pins to hand out!  mary5454:  I was having alot of itching and scaliness. My onco said that sometimes it's the cold, dry weather rather than (or on top of) SE's.  Anyway, I started religiously using extra moisturizing cream (I used the unscented, Trader Joe brand) and I've soaked in Aveeno oatmeal bath - double packs. I also use gold bond powder after a bath or shower. The improvement has been wonderful.   I've had good luck with gold bond powder on my scalp - I rub it on my head every morning before any hats, scarves or wig go on my head. No itchy scalp any more.",
