My tumor markers were elevated at my last appointment May 2nd and a PET scan showed 2 questionable areas on my liver. The biopsy returned positive and so now I start chemo next week (which I didn't have last year). Found this site from a news article about a 17 year survivor so that gives me hope. Any tips or suggestions would be welcome! Beth Log in to post a reply",
