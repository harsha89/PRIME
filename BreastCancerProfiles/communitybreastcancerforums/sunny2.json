I look forward to my post that says, \"it's back!\"  Until then, blessings to all.",

I finished with Herceptin in Oct 2012 and I could not tell that it stunted my hair growth at all.  Could it have contributed to this mess though?  Oh please, somebody, tell me my former locks will return!!!  Funny, people would say during that time of baldness...\"Oh, your hair will come back and be more beautiful than ever\"....hmm, hasn't happened yet.",
