I dont get sick anymore, but still have major stomach issues all the time, its like a upset stomach or something, and it seems to arrive when I start taking steroids, how long does it take for these to leave your system? I am still very fatigued as well, like I find it hard to even get up and walk around, I ususally just stay in bed/couch all day wath tv, etc.....Is all this fatigue part of the chemo, because my counts look very good...:) Thanks",
