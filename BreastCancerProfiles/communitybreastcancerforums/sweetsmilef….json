My heart goes out to you. When my first husband passed away at the age of 44, my kids were 8 and 12 respectively. At that point, I had to be the strong one in the family. Today, my daughter is married, my son is in a wonderful relationship, and I have remarried to a terrific man. I hope you get tons of support from your family, your friends, and all of us here. I wish you solace and healing, and hope that the rest of your radiation treatments go smoothly.",

I'm sorry to hear that you have had such serious allergic reactions too. Well, at least we are raising the consciousness of our medical professionals about the various SE's, even the outlying ones that are rare. And we are digging into the deepest reserves of our grit and determination to get through all this \"stuff.\" The good news is that I have just one more week to go - my boost starts on Monday, and my breast looks like a crime scene, all marked up with surgical markers, \"X\" marks the spots and tagaderm transparent circular stickies all over.

One woman whom I hadn't even met was crying for me. I am so glad to be finished... and yet I'm not. The radiation nurse warned me against pulling off the marker stickers, since my skin is so tender from the radiation, it might tear off the skin as well. She suggested when I shower with Dove, to gently massage the edges. So those \"X' marks the spot stickies will be on for a while longer. Also fatigue, so I hope this will be a restful weekend. At times, my nipple feels like a knife is stabbing it, and the prescription lidocaine doesn't help. If I'm home, I'll use the aloe vera gel from the refrigerator. Congrats to all who have finished (or are almost finished with) treatment, Lojo100 and speedyteach. And to everyone who is still going through treatment, I wish you all strength.

I am a survivor, yes. But having cancer is affecting me profoundly. I know whenever I go for screens in the future, I will be anxious. And even past the five year mark, there are never any guarantees. At least today I was able to gently roll off several of those blasted clear markers in the shower. My breasts are more asymmeticial than ever, with swellings, dips, tats and small scars. None of it is terrible, but it definitely is a reminder. By the way, you would probably appreciate that several times during this whole process, my son asked if I would like to visit him and his girlfriend for cat therapy. Two mostly all-black cats, Clementine and Oscar. Their company was very relaxing.  Strength and fortitude to all you ladies!",

Before getting dressed after the treatment, I slathered Aquafor on my breast. When I got home, I spent 30 minutes icing it, following the suggestion of some wonderful person on this site. (dip a washcloth in ice water, squeeze it out and hold it over my breast until it warms up; repeat until the water in the basin gets warm. Well, I did it for half an hour, and then it was dinner time and I was starved.) I had practiced the Deep Inspiration Breath Hold. The radiation therapists would tell me to take a deep breath; I never needed to hold it for more than 15 seconds, and a few times, they told me to breathe deeper. Afterwards, they told me that they needed accuracy within 3 millimeters to avoid my heart. Actually, this reassured me. In the evening, I used an ice pack occasionally, and used Calendula cream before going to sleep and first thing in the morning. I know that skin reactions may take a week or 2 to develop. My skin is quite fair, and I am trying to be prepared. Also ordered Miaderm from Amazon, to have in reserve. My breast surgeon and RO are both female; yesterday the 2 radiation therapists were men. It felt a bit weird, but I just went with the flow. They were professional, however I would have been more comfortable with female radiation therapists.",

Unfortunately, mine was another stark reminder that I am still not over the side effects of radiation. The treatments have heightened my sensitivity to fragrances, which can lead to asthmatic attacks. Someone used an aerosol deodorizer in the bathroom, and when I went in, it just overpowered me. I held my breath, but still, nothing helped. Went into a full-blown asthmatic attack. Not pleasant at all. It takes hours to recover. And no, inhalers or nebulizers don't help, since it is not actually asthma. (How many of you have even heard of laryngeal hypersensitivity?) A question for all of you... at 2 weeks out from the final boost, how many of you are experiencing sharp stabbing pains? My boost was focused on and above my nipple, and well, ouch, major ouch. Skin looks like a prickly heat rash, but at least no blisters or open wounds. Lidocaine jelly 2% doesn't help, nor did the advil or Tramadol. Saturday afternoon, the pains came about every 15 minutes for a while. I think I will call my RO soon... but it seems to me she has given me most of what is already in her arsenal. Any suggestions? Be well and be strong, my dear friends.",

After being post-menopausal for over a decade, the hot flashes are coming back. Even last night, when I was icing. I wish I could have them during the radiation, when the room feels like it's 60 degrees and the fan is blowing. Emotionally it's been a rollercoaster and an effort to stay on keel. At least so far, no radiation burns. I use Aquafor immediately after treatment, Calendula cream in the morning and night time, and sometimes, aloe vera gel made fresh from aloe vera leaves (thanks to my wonderful cleaning woman, Maria!)

Before I started radiation, I bought a bunch of men's tee-shirts, and wear them without a bra after I apply the Aquafor. Plus a pullover and a drapey sweater. I'm relatively small, so there's little \"bouncing\" but I like the effect of a waterfall sweater or long vest, giving lots of camouflage. Good luck with the rest of the radiation sessions! ",

I have a sensitivity to artificial fragrances. One of the radiation techs had used a powdered shampoo that was scented. I smelled the scent before, but went through the treatment. By the end, my sensitivity was triggered, and I had a full-blown asthmatic reaction, which lasted several hours. (Earlier in the week, when I had a haircut, the stupid owner of the salon was spraying a scented aerosol all over the salon, and that triggered a bad reaction as well.) So even though my sensitivity has been under control for a number of years, it seems to me that the radiation has affected my ability to tolerate artificial fragrances. Read, no longer able to tolerate. Since it's not asthma, asthma inhalers don't work either. So they finally brought over a basin filled with hot water and a blanket, and it helped a little. I had to wait for my DH who was on his way to pick me up. When I got home, I sat in the bathroom with the shower running. The steam is about the only thing that helps me. I feel like my whole body has been through the ringer. Slept for about an hour after dinner, and will probably go to sleep again soon. I will definitely need the weekend to recover. I called my RO when I got home. She said she had never heard of such a reaction (I said there was always a first time for an outlier reaction) but she would investigate. Wishing everyone else a calm, restful and restorative weekend.",

My DH and I are headed to Mexico in 2 weeks for 5 days of R&R, Playa del Carmen, and I will bring long-sleeved tops and cover-ups and SPF 100. The good news is that I am finally starting to feel more like myself. No sharp stabbing pains in almost a week, and today we actually went out and had a fun day at a holiday crafts festival. Fun hadn't been on my agenda in months. My nipple and areola are no longer bright red, and the radiation burn is fading. And yes, the awareness of what I have been through is finally hitting me, like PTSD. Before, I did exactly what I had to do, went to every doctor, every appointment and surrendered my life to their requirements. Now at times, I feel so grateful that my eyes just well up... and I never felt that I was dealing with a life-threatening situation, either. Thanks to all of you out there who have shared this ride... dodgersgirl, catlady, utjoy, 70charger, among others, who have inspired me and amazed me with your courage and insight.
