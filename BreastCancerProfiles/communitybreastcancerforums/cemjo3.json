But at the same time it gives me comfort in a strange way to know that my experiences are not alone, even as strange as my situation gets.... Anyway, I saw another surgeon today that agrees that something is going on, but thinks that we should take the wait and see approach. My (R) breast has a small thickening under nipple and My (L)nipple continues to have very sporatic \"rust\" colored discharge that nobody can produce. I was told to wear breast shells (normally used to help nursing Moms with engorged breasts)to see if I could collect the discharge, I've even been told to try a breast pump to see if I can express some of the liquid. I have not done this step as I no longer have a breast pump, and do not want to purchase another one. Does this make sense? This surgeon was supposed to have all of my films, and met with a radiologist to review everything before meeting with me. Although his first suggestion was to have an MRI done, which I have already done. He said that he was not impressed with the films and that we should wait 3 more months to do them again. I thought he was talking about the findings, but he was talking about the quality. The insurance company will not pay for another set until it has been six months. Agrees with the first surgeon that the ducts should be removed, but wants to determine which one first. I don't think that I ever prayed as hard as I did today that he could make the discharge happen. I'm starting to feel like maybe they do not believe me...and as always the appointment left me no closer to answers, but to more tests, and my least favorite saying, you are really to young for cancer anyway. (This time thankfully not the surgeon, but the nurse who was scheduling my mammogram and ultrasound for October.) Sorry for the rambeling, but thanks for listening! Log in to post a reply",

I got a call yesterday via voicemail at work. It was my doctor and the message said she had some test results and to please call her. When I called back she said nothing news showed up. Which was good new and bad because it did not help determine the cause for the left nipple discharge, she is suggesting a terminal duct excision. Any thoughts? Also she said the right side area that she was VERY concerned about appears to be just extra density. Now I know that I am \"young\" and that my breasts are fairly dense, but can an MRI tell that much? Mammo, Diagnostic Mammo, ultrasound and surgeon all think it is something suspicious and MRI says density. So she is just leaving it at that. Should I to? I am so appreciative of this board as all of you have gotten me through the last few months. It just seems I end up with more questions than I had before.... Log in to post a reply",

It was noisy and my headphones popped off one of my ears, but I just closed my eyes and thought about the shopping I was going to do after. (sad part is this was a \"date\" with my husband. He was able to take the whole day off from work as was I so we used it to our \"tomb\" plus they had cool air blowing on me and talked to me quite a bit.. Wishing you luck!",

Problem is she does not nor do I know what duct is causing the discharge, so she wants to remove all the ducts. I am not excited about this. I also asked her about the right side lump, and she again said that they think that it is just super concentrated density. But should continue with follow up. This was the first time follow up was reccomended, so I asked what she meant and she treated me like I should already know all of this, (but SHE never told me) she said that I should have mammograms every six months for the next two years. I left her office with her office would callme with an appointment for an ultrasound on the left side and then my surgery date. Friday I went to another breast specialist at another facility and she said that she does not recommend the surgery yet. She wants me to come to her office every two weeks so she can produce the discharge, and then do a ductogram, then the surgery. I asked her about the right side, and she said that she did not get to see the films, (even though I confirmed with her office that they had everything) but the MRI was fine so she to thought that it was density, no need to follow up with mammo's until I am 40 because I am to YOUNG for cancer. I wanted to punch her lights out. I am so frustrated and feel like I am out of options. I hate that my boob leaks for no reason, and I hate knowing that I have some sort of lump in my other breast, that granted may very well be density, but HOW do they know! Any thoughts on which direction I should go, or what to do now? I am going to request a copy of all the tests for my records, but the mammogram facility told me last time that they can not make copies....Is this true? Thanks for the help! I am going to go out and enjoy this beautiful day and celebrate with my youngest as today is his 5th birthday, and yes he reminded me of it at 3:00 this morning! LOL Log in to post a reply",
