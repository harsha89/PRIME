Unfortunately our summer of fun, sun and adventures turned into crutches, MO trips, scans, rads and procedures.  I am also paralyzed with fear and sadness when I think about my girls distant future and what I will be able to share with them. Now, more than ever I am living in the present and it is important for me to pace myself, take a nap, lock the bedroom door for 10 minutes. Accepting and practicing that certain messes or mishaps disappear with an easy turn of my head and to continue to stay engaged with those that matter most.  To iamstronger, I also had trouble letting friends, old coworkers and family in on my little secret. As it turns out I feel a little lighter on my feet after once those were aware. I will admit it was a relief when my mother spoke with my daughters teacher (my Harper would have let it out of the bra- I mean bag eventually saying or wearing our pink \"Annie's Army\" shirts to school :-) ~~Wherever you are, be all there....
