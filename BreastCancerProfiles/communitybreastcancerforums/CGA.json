My good friend (my heart) was diagnosed four weeks ago with Stage IV triple negative IDC.  She has mets to the ovary, uterus, omentum (all removed as they thought it was ovarian to start) lung (\"lungs are filled with it\"), brain (too many to count according to neurologist), spine, stomach and liver.  She is getting WBRT now.  She is fading before our eyes.  She also does not seem to grasp the severity of her condition (maybe the brain mets or WBRT??).  Her husband has asked that she have chemo after the WBRT.  He was told that it was useless, but they are going to do it.  Is there really such a point?  Will chemo do any good? Will it shorten her life? and will it make the rest of her time so unbearable it isnt worth it?  She is 52.  They never found the primary tumor.  Thanks for your help. Log in to post a reply",

Thanks again!",

Its the question we have all been dancing around, but it has just seemed to take over in the last two weeks.  I'm not sure she has two weeks left.",

I am all for anything that kicks this cancer's butt.  As for denial, there is alot of that going on right now.  I think I have it too.  We were with other friends today and they couldnt believe how bad she looks.  I think she looks beautiful. A As for a second opinion, she and her husband are just not there.  Thanks again, you all just amaze me!",
