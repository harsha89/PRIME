I had to drive an extra 1/2 hour in traffic to go to another doctor but I couldn't be around toxic negativity while I'm fighting for my life. Thank God I had a brilliant surgeon who talked to us for a half hour about Ibrance and other treatments afterward, hope and enjoying life. It relieved my fear and fortified us for what lies ahead. If you cannot get another doctor than talk with him about how he made you feel and allow him to apologize it's so important for you to feel good about your treatment.  Support, Tanya",

All I could do was pray for him my DH handled everything else. I kept the kids away at the end he deteriorated quickly. I pray your dog is better today. They are so much more resilient than we think. Enjoy your grandpuppy. Oh and I went to see Thurgood Marshall movie and then ate at PF Changs. One just opened near us. My daughter and I shared an appetizer meal and desert. Mae your race pictures are amazing and the fact that you had a nice pace is a reward in and of itself. Thanks for sharing. Lynne NH can't wait to see drink umbrella pictures. I'm happy that you were able to enjoy the warmth and sun. I looked at my xrays of my hip bone yesterday. Florida hospital has a patient portal. Big scary words which all mean cancer in my hip bone but it has shrunk. So I keep on taking Ibrance. Someone said that they feel pangs and pain at night and hot flashes and attribute it all to the Ibrance working. I like that scenario. I'm adopting that Mantra. ",

When you retire I hope you can enjoy your free time as much as possible. Retirement is something we plan for but not this rotten cancer to go with it. Micmel your description of \"scan\" deserves an \"A\" in English! I had asked my Onc if the 125mg Ibrance had a cumulative effect, as in each cycle we feel worse and he said no. Do you agree? I kind of got off the optimum cycle last month due to infection I had to take the shots faslodex on Wednesday but not the Ibrance until Sunday after I had completely finished my penicillin. So, now I completed my pills Saturday and will resume them this Wednesday. In my mind this is going to suck in advance. 50's enjoy enjoy enjoy. It looks amazing. Lot's of exploring for you guys to do. My cousin arrived from Hawaii and we've been working on ancestry stuff. Digging through pictures and making up stories. Trying to reach out to older relatives to get more names and stories. I've been pushing myself out of my comfort zone and not sleeping as much. We went for acupuncture treatment and that always makes me feel energized etc. It reduces my hot flashes too for a night or so. God willing when she (my cousin) leaves to go visit her niece in Ft. Lauderdale I'm going with her. It will be the first time I get to meet this side of my family. Too many miles and not enough time. I agree Micmel about the staying on hormones after the 5 year mark. I remember when my Onc took me off of it. I was happy actually bc SE are real. But that happiness came with the price I'm paying now. Also after the 5 years we should have scans at least once a year. Who knows when the cancer came back in my body? I was having Mammos every 6 months and blood work. That didn't see the cancer in my ovary and bones. For the future follow up care needs to include everywhere cancer usually goes not just breasts. Mae and Micmel I will be with you on the 14th for the gut wrenching, mind blowing, anxiety igniting, emotion controlling, terrifiingly paralyzing. Energy sucking, life altering,body poisoning,muscle weakening , ugly scarring and disfiguring, fear with every breath. Effing scan and MRI. Praying that these tests have magnificent, encouraging, uplifting, miraculous cancer busting destroying results. Much love, Tanya_Djamila ",

They're right in Orlando but it's an hour and 1/2 drive without the sometimes awful traffic, so we decided to rent a room and see some relatives Friday and the others Saturday and then drive home.

I cannot believe the difference it made. If it does the same job then I am very pleased. Someone posted on the Ibrance thread that there have been studies done that suggest that 75 and 100 mg do the same thing as 125. Of course who wants to find out that 125 worked and 75 didn't. Too high a price to pay. The study suggested that even 25 mg works!!! I wish they'd find a cure and put a move on it with the research. Imagine the QOL on 25?

I had a partial mastectomy so I\u2019m always lopsided. I used to be self conscious and now I don\u2019t pay attention to it at all. I\u2019m 60.

Some days I keep reminding myself to be productive, grateful and content. Mae I thank you for sharing that doctor appt story. My oldest sister is coming to visit me next week and I have an appt with the infusion room blood work and faslodex shot so I\u2019ll not invite her for that PTSD experience. It\u2019s our reality and people don\u2019t look at us like that. If they could see our insides and not only our outward experience they would all barf. MJH I\u2019m sorry about the sugar discovery. I think for all of us we have heard that we cannot eat sugar bc it feeds the cancer. Ugh and then we crave it. I hope you can get the perfect medicine for yourself. I\u2019m happy you had your 70 degree aquarium day. Waving at you Mag moving day will be exciting. Minnie yes I can still walk without pain. I\u2019m just finishing up physical therapy which has been really helpful. Left hip btw Have a good weekend grannax blueshine runor and big anyone else I forgot. Tanya ",

My husband and I went to Naples when we first came to FL for a getaway and we went to Tiger tail beach or something like that. I always miss my children or grandchildren when I'm on vacation with my husband. I often think of what fun we'd be having if they were with us but it's so much work. Rest and relaxation is wonderful. I'm happy the weather is behaving for you. ENJOY! Mae those pants look like a crayon box all laid out. Beautifully colorful. I'm sure you'll enjoy your upcoming FL vacation in Destin. Micmel the shoes are classy and comfortable. Someone called them kitten heels. So cute. I lost my nerve and strength to wear heels after the 70's platform high heeled life. lol Grannax being with my grandchildren is wonderful. Five of them currently live two houses down and across the street. They play basketball in the cul de sac and my dear granddaughter checks on us daily after school. They are a tonic. Magda congratulations on getting the house and closing in 3 weeks. That's excellent. You're a strong woman moving forward and changing takes Viking strength. You got it. Keetmom my prayers are with you. Beginning a new treatment regimen is filled with unknowns. We are all here for you. MJan I hope your scan results are posted for you soon with great results. Minnie I'm sorry to hear about your sciatica. All the walking I did with my sister this week reminded me of my dear hip. Leapfrog I intend to read your blog. Divine I loved the artists date lesson that your son shared with you. I intend to try it soon. Anyone I missed have a lovely day. My DH will have his last day of work Thursday. Friday morning they're having a party for him at school and then that afternoon we're off for a 10 day trip to Dubai and Saudi Arabia. We'll see if this retirement works for him. It's the third job he's retired from. Tanya",

That is a nice amount of weight to gain and you need it to fight. Prayers for your treatment outcomes to be great this time. Lynnwood 1960 thanks for the reminder of our justifiable feelings.

Mae you're a mess with the roach stickers. I hate roaches especially the monster New Orleans type. We have palmetto bugs in FL and they are creepy to me but especially if they get inside. Lynne NH happy you got sleep. I had to look up dexamethasone and realize that its' a steroid. I also didn't know that fart machines are a thing. Gracie M- so sorry about the Ibrance not working and the loss of treatment time. I'd be ranting too. Big B you are a diplomat.

Micmel I hope you get your scan results and that they are steady as she goes NED. I'm happy that your DH was home with you for a bit. The graduation was wonderful. I went to one ceremony and a large family lunch. I'm ecstatic for my grandson and all the promise that he holds. I watched him step into manhood with some tools that will help him keep his integrity and zeal for learning. I was super duper sad to leave. He was offered a job with an apartment during the summer. He was also offered a teaching job but will continue to interview and try to get a job offer which includes continuing his education.

Micmel I\u2019ve been wanting to share a story with you about my former neighbor from many years ago. I think she had the same religious affiliation as your DD and SIL. Her and her husband raised two sons the boys were a few years younger than me. They were all standoffish and did the neighbor wave thing. Her husband was a sheriff and usually drove the car home. One horrible evening he tried to beat the train and didn\u2019t make it. His widow showed up on my doorstep one day after the funeral and poured her heart out. She said that she had endured with patience some of the rules that she didn\u2019t agree to over the years but loved and fellowship led with her congregation. Apparently some people (sinners) would be given the silent treatment t for whatever offense but she said she would always smile or wink at them to let them know they weren\u2019t alone. Apparently after her husband so tragically died she needed something repaired at her home and called the temple. The head priests wife called her back a little later and told her that she hoped she wouldn\u2019t be calling on everyone\u2019s husbands to fix things now that her husband was gone. (Widow shaming) - if there issuch a thing. That\u2019s when she came to my door and became my dear friend. She had never worked all those years and. Now had to do everything. She still held her religious beliefs to the end of her life but she left the people who were in her congregation found her voice and made a beautiful independent life for herself. I am hopeful that your DD will see the parts that concern you and make decisions based on her heart using the values and love that you and your DH have instilled in her. Tanya",

Today when I ate it for lunch it was awful. I guess I have to stick with fattening food because taste is really important. Gracie the Ibrance and faslodex has gotten rid of the tumor that I had in my spine, belly, and ribs. The lesion I have in my hip is still there but it has shrunk from 20 to 5 and I'm not due to have scans again until April I think. I also had radiation to the hip and spine, and am hoping that all of the tumors are being obliterated. The Ibrance is not as bad as the Taxol, Taxotere and Adriamycin cocktails that I endured in 2003. The SE's from these were severe but I only took them for the 6 cycles and then radiation. We are all hoping and praying for good results. I hope that you find better treatment options. Until something better becomes available we're stuck with these treatments. We're all managing, however not like the Julie on the commercial. Much love hugs and hope sent your way.",

I thought about making pumpkin muffins but yesterday was pill 21 and the thought of standing in the kitchen makes me weary. Sorry about your car loss. I hope you get something better this time. Our PET scan results are why we have so much angst before we go. You encourage me when you speak so matter of factly about the results and forge on. Blueshine I'm happy you had time with your grand baby too! Micmel I'm so happy that you're feeling a little better. DH being there is probably a huge force behind your wellness. I'm glad that you're off of Ibrance for a break. You need to be strong to fight this flu monster. It has a bad reputation. Minnie and 50's girl I cooked the mohlokhia the way my friend did. I also cook it separately. My DH likes it on top of his rice. It reminds me of okra because it has a type of consistency like that. I found it in a middle eastern store or maybe the store said Indian spices. It was in the frozen section. Make sure you get the chopped one. It tastes salty only because of the chicken broth. i do sometimes add a few pieces of chicken to it. I'm trying to eat more of the things I need like fiber and vegetables that have iron content that could make a difference in my low iron. I even started eating beets again. I always liked them but only realized recently that they detoxify the liver, increase stamina, help the brain fog. My acupuncture doctor recommended some of these nutritional changes rather than all the supplements that I try to take. I went to acupuncture Saturday and got a vitamin B-12 shot and a list of things to eat for breakfast to prevent me from eating tea and toast breakfasts. Mae have fun cooking! I made a turkey breast yesterday and it was delicious. I hate cooking the whole bird bc it's just the two of us here. Wednesday I see my ONC I have to get my list together of questions. i want to travel a little and called the office to see if I could get a vaccine for travel and he said he'd get back to me Tuesday. Ugh! My DH said i seem too out of breath and tired for travel. Since this MBC I don't foresee any time when I won't be having some SE's from medication. My list will include reducing the dosage from 125 to 100 or less because I seem to be getting progressively tired each month that I'm on this 125 Ibrance. Gracie M my ANC was 1.6 when I started my last round of Ibrance. I started tired so now I'm finishing it like a rag doll. 8 treatments down. I hope everyone has a wonderful rest of today. It started out warm and breezy and now it's raining here. Tanya",

We all have figured out how to deal with the toxic people in our lives, reminds me of the song 50 ways to leave your lover. So far we have: 1. Don\u2019t engage 2.

I ventured out by myself to return a shirt and felt really sick, dizzy and faint at the store. Thank God it passed and I was able to drive myself home. I finally found a way to describe my lifetime treatment regimen to a friend. It's like taking birth control pills forever. I don't share these type of experiences with my DH because I don't want him to worry and I want my freedom too. I slept very well for the last two nights because the weather was cool. Today I woke up at 6:45 and went back to sleep around 9 and didn't wake up until 11:30. I feel super lazy when this happens. This medication sucks the life out of me. I'm happy it's working though and I can sit here and enjoy a perfectly gorgeous day. Mae Good luck with your race this weekend. I walked to the corner a few days ago and thought I'd have to call an Uber to get back. Gigantic hot flash took my breath away. I would love to race walk again. I remember the hard breathing and the will to finish the race with whatever pain, hill, breathlessness was going on. It was wonderful to run with all of those women. I didn't enjoy the run as much in mixed company - sometimes men are too competitive. Run/walk for all of us Mae. Chelle G - how old is your daughter? I remember when I was first diagnosed Stage III my daughter was 15. I was devastated that she had to live with this pain. She always kept a brave face in front of me but confided in her sister how scared she was. My DH was wonderful and stayed home with her, (when she also refused to go to school). Allegedly she was being home schooled but in all actuality she lost that year. She couldn't do it and we couldn't force her. I always used to help her with her homework and I just had chemo brain and too many side effects doctors appts. aches, pain, exhaustion. The school was good about extending and she finally finished all of her work after my treatment was done. I enjoyed her company at home but I really wanted her to go to school. I pray that your daughter will be fine and that you'll reach a compromise that she is comfortable with. Micmel you make my day daily with your walmart, grandpuppy spider fear pics etc. I hate scans too. The anxiety prior to the appt. is enough to make me faint. But then somehow we all muster the strength to do it. This time cancer is Stage IV. I thought I was done with this monster and I'm grateful for the time I had without it. Sometimes for fleeting moments I feel that I don't have these tumors but a twinge of pain or dizziness or some weird thing that's going on in my body reminds me with a quickness. There's a cancer pamper party tonight at the local cancer hospital. I haven't decided whether or not I'll attend. I guess I'll see how I feel this evening. Take Care All, Tanya  ",

I prayed so hard for God to give them some ease and He has. And now another test. I read my PET scan myself yesterday, not just taking the doctors word for it. I saw these words 'uptake FDG\" or something like that. I googled it and it said that the sugar dye substance still shows where the cancer areas were. It's all frightening and unnerving. But still we move on. Thank you Micmel for the sleeping pill advice. I just take it nightly now. When I don't take it immediately I end up staying up way past any normalcy and then sleep late and hard the next day. I submit to the nightsweats and anxiety and just take the pill.

We all window shopped and reminisced about the Fit 2 Run store where we picked up our shirts for the marathons which seem like that happened decades ago. The distance between health and sickness .... My activity is based on how I feel each day with the constant of being tired. I'm cranky and I take it all out on my DH and then apologize. I feel so bad that I do that.

My onc said in a week or two and I'll go with the 2ish bc all of these tests are hard. They all tell a story of our insides. I'm happy Keetmom that Emma doesn't have to get scans for 6 months.

Claudia you're my 26 round hero. Gracie I'm happy you got that Ibrance year and now you'll see what's next. I really hope it did its job. I hate the thought too of taking sleeping pills but i took it twice since (Wednesday last week) Micmel suggested it and I fell into a great sleep and didn't feel hungover. Then I didn't take it for two nights one night I slept well the other Saturday night not at all. Finally yesterday I fell asleep early 8:00 and woke up by 10:00; by 1:00 a.m. I just took the pill. My doctor warned me to be careful bc I would want it all the time. But really DUDE how much time do I have again? I would like to sleep at night and be somewhat productive during the day. Lynne I hope your cold is getting better. It sounds like the doctor prescribed you everything except chicken soup. I've been eating vitamins like candy trying to avoid germs, running holding my breath from coughs and sneezes lol. I know it doesn't work that way but I do hold my breath and move. Keetmom your Wisconsin snow song is chilling. I hope you are staying warm. My trip to Dallas was exciting and fun. It was my Ibrance off week so I had some energy and surprisingly pushed myself to try to participate in every event. Two of my DD are married to two brothers. My eldest DD lives across the street and is divorced from one of the brothers. My son was married and has two children and his ex wifes brother is also married to the sister of my two son in laws. Make sense. Anyway I went to see the cousins of my grandchildren and ex inlaws who we were friends with for years and love to death. MY DD was married for 17 years. Our ex inlaws we have been friends with for almost 40 years. We have two grandchildren in common both in college. I know it's confusing but we all actually love each other and had a great time with food and luncheons, dinner, etc. My other dear friends from Atlanta, Baltimore and Cincinnati joined us. Dallas was freezing but we didn't catch any snow thankfully. No one mentioned cancer and they all said that we were in their prayers. Nice not to have the cancer pity for an entire weekend.  ",

I was reading a lot about QOL on another thread and survivors reducing their Ibrance to 75mg with the same results. I'm going to ask my doctor about this also before I destroy my ability to make WBC. Also someone said there is a study to see if 25mg works as effectively. I can't even imagine how that would affect my QOL. We'll be back at the gym and running races. I know I'm 60 but I did so enjoy running. Going to PT makes my muscles feel like they want to be busy again, but then the fatigue hits. ITanya",

I intend to support the women's march or any march if gun control is part of their platform. We should at least start with banning assault rifles. I don't think anyone needs that to defend their home and property. This is not what our fore fathers were talking about with a right to bear arms. This doesn't make sense. This did not occur near Tampa but really I don't care what state or city these are all of our children. Part and parcel of our society. Innocent victims. My mom was watching TV in NY and she called because I have two grandchildren in high school and she just saw FL. I feel for these families and their entire community. It wasn't my grandchildren this time. I'm finished with my rant now. Big B I hope your DH gets well soon. I will miss you but I completely understand the priority. Just drop a line when you need to. Take care. Grannax your caddy is my smile for the month. So necessary lol. Minnie I'm sorry that you're in pain. I dont know what works for pain without so many miserable side effects and sometimes I don't think it really works. I was told that cannabis in FL is not paid for by insurance and I went to one doctor and he wanted a $275. consultation fee. I have to find another way. It's a state by state regulation here because it's not federal yet. So there's still a chance for a rip off. MJH I hope you are well today. Lynne Man You're a mighty woman. I had taxotere before and it was a strong medication. I think they must have modified it some compared to 14 years ago. I pray it's working that's the most important part of what we go through. We will go through anything, even trials to be here and live our life and leave something for someone else. I hate poor service when we go out. I'm going to try a movie tonight and to avoid the food fiasco and movie time I'm going to try cinebistro. I heard the food was OK. Mae love your getaways. Thanks for sharing it's like a tonic - for real. Micmel the bouquet is perfect. I love the jewelry too. Lynne 50's mothers and grandmothers wish for the same things. Blueshine great news!! Gracie I hope the patches work or ointment or something. I am also going to ask my ONC about paliative meds. He has his expertise in oncology and hematology not pain. Take care all Tanya",

I had three of the five of them live with us when they first married. Two of their x spouses I no longer speak to. My eldest sons x wife was married to him for 9 years and then told him two of the children he'd been supporting for the past two and a half years were sired by his best friend. Somehow I managed to wrestle a 10 inch kitchen knife out of his hands which allowed him not to be an inamate. My middle daughters x managed to dump her on our doorstep 17 years after marriage with 5 kids. We've had our share of toxic people. Somehow over the years we've gotten past these horrors and kept our marriage alive for 39 years. As the time passes I don't take their heart break to my heart. I try to be calm and give advice only when asked. My x son in law who dumped the kids and wife claimed a few of them on his income tax so yesterday my daughter found out when she got a notification from IRS so now she'll have to fight with the government to get money. My husband started to get angry but really why bother. Some people just suck and they are around to test us. I'm happy that my daughter is safe and loved and she has a job and lives across the street from us. She was a pain growing up but now that she's 34 she's lovely and a true fighter. She'll get her tax return but not right now. X son in law will eventually get whatevers coming to him. In the meantime I'm gonna do some gardening with DH. Tomorrow I get the medi port and I will not be awake thanks to the bloody stories and creepiness of the tent over the procedure. I had one before 14 years ago. I pray it works and I won't have the nurses fishing for my veins twice a month. Have a good day all. Tanya",

Keetmom I hope you are resting and don't have any more scares like that. Thanks for letting everyone know so quickly that you were OK. We all worry about each other. And I pray for us all. Holmes 13 my husband kinda shushes me when I talk about death. When I get good scan results he lives in the fantasy world of you're not dying. It's very hard for him. He lived through the losses of both parents, three siblings, he has one brother left who's 84. My husband is 68. It's emotional for him. We've been together for 39 years. Mae Thanks for the Woo Hoo. Popcorn at Micmels daughter show and a front row seat is the ticket. It's all a learning experience now for them. Congratulations on your last day June 29th!! Enjoy the peace. It's bittersweet though. I definitely mourned the loss of my work family but I am grateful for the freedom. Runor I'm with you on moving out with dignity and also I'm sure we don't want to end on a more heightened negative note. Lynwood 1960 Thanks for the congrats and celebrate I did. I'm exhausted now. I celebrated with my husband and friends a few nice dinner outings and last night a family dinner, simple and sweet. Micmel thanks for the congrats and I swear all of you ladies know how the scan results are. Everyone else just kinda gives a hug and back pack but you ladies are jumping up and down with me. I'm happy your daughter is leaving and it looks promising for reconciliation. Grannax Aubrie is a star. You guys look great. I would've been crying through the entire performance. Elle on Wheels congratulations bright eyes! Big B thanks for the parachute float in. I pray your scan results will be wonderful. I hope your day went well today. I know you're in a caretaker role now shoulder surgery must be debilitating. Stay strong. Blueshine I like the advice to compromise with DD. I think in all of our adult difficult relations there is a degree of compromise or there is friction. 50's girl thanks for the congrats. Why did Bon leave? I don't leave a legacy of the wonderful things that you have been blessed to keep over the years. We found some interesting things that my Nana left but they didn't come with stories sadly. My siblings divided things and for some reason is was nauseating to watch them do it. I'm not judging them but I took a shovel that my Nana used to garden with and it broke and is gone. I have Nana's pictures and sage advice that lives in me. I love the sentimental valuable things that you have and the stories it makes me wish I had kept something more. MJH thanks for the TJ bouquet. Your flowers are gorgeous. I love the wicker basket flower planters. How do they hold up in the weather. What do you do to care for them since they're antiques. Love the landscaping. Thanks for sharing Maine it's lovely. I've never been to Maine. Cape Cod is the farthest north I've been on the east coast. I've been to Canada and New York border. Love your tourquoise cruising machine. Minnie Welcome home from Ireland. Hope you had a wonderful trip. Lynne NH your roses are beautiful especially juxtaposed against the white fence. Katy K I had similar concerns about my husband and what he would be doing after my demise but I don't live in that dreadful future. I'm living to the best of my ability now. I don't expect he'd enjoy being alone and I know he'll miss me. I hope he'll not dwell on the end and rather focus on the time that we spent living our lives to the fullest in sickness and in health through hell and highwater. This weekend, God willing we all go camping. My son and grandson, brother, DD and her five kids, hubby and several other families. We rented 7 cabins near a lake and hopefully will do fishing, kayaking, horseback riding, field day activities for the kids, bonfire, you know camping delights. After we return home,God willing June 25th my DH and I leave for NY. Family reunion for my moms side in Washington DC and then July 3rd we go to visit my uncle in Morocco. He retired there 30 years ago and I've visited him once. Since his only sibling, my dad died 2 years ago I've been wanting to see him and kind of say good bye before one of us leaves this earth. He has a large family there but rarely do any of us in the US visit him. He's also not the kind, gentle fun loving soul that my dad was so I have to get prepared for the personality. ugh. My mother will join us for the Moroccan trip. I'm praying for good health in all of this. Goodnight strong ladies Tanya",

That's another part of love. I want my children/grandchildren to have the inheritance that we both worked for. I think and trust that he will make intelligent decisions but I have written a will just in case. I am comforted by the hope and prayer that we will be reunited in heaven.

Re potted a dying plant, cleaned pool filter, laundry, cleaned a bathroom woo hoo, and then read a book on the porch. I ordered an instant pot. I hope it gives me the incentive to cook some healthier meals in a quicker amount of time and then I can throw away all of my pots. lol I can dream. Big yes they caught the serial killer. He looks like he, of course, has mental illness. I briefly caught him on the news today being arraigned in (what looked like) a bullet proof jumper. My DH and I both agreed that putting a bullet in his head would be a fitting punishment and wouldn't waste taxpayers money for the court case, jail time and lethal injection. Deep sigh feeling so sad for the families who lost loved ones and were traumatized for almost two months. Micmel I'm sorry that your grandpuppy was like that. He must've been miserable. I think I'd be in the fetal position in a corner too. Life's messes... Ladies maybe I missed a post but Micmel shared some feelings about intimacy that she was having. I'm no expert but I really want to be supportive since I think I went through this 13 years ago (at age 46) when I was thrust into early menopause with one less breast than I was used to. My DH was very supportive and we talked about everything what hurt what didn't. He was patient and kind. Eventually I accepted myself, welcomed and embraced my new me. I still loved him and did want to share intimacy with him again. I knew that it wouldn't be the same because we both had changed. \"Just like me\", is a product that you can order online for vaginal dryness. Even after all the pain and suffering Micmel, I swear you can enjoy your husband again. In 2012 my DH had a stroke and once again this marriage had to weather another storm and wait until we were able to resume that part of our relationship. When cancer came rearing it's ugliness again in April 2017 and I had a hysterctomy in June I really just wanted to say can we just be old celibate buddies/roommates? But he always is affectionate reassuring and patient. I hope I haven't offended anyone with this post. I want our marriages and relationships to be as fulfilling as possible for the rest of whatever time that we have. Much love all",

No comparison to my last 10 years of bone density reports and no appointment recommendation. I felt like once he found out that my BC is Stage IV he didn't feel like it was worth it. Yuck. Maybe he didn't feel that way but his actions made me feel terrible. I went into his office and handed the botched report and asked the receptionist to put a note on it and tell him to compare my bone density to my previous reports and not to the \"adult mean\", and recommend an appt. date, not necessarily with him but when it is needed again.

But I am not allowed to use heating pad on my back anymore he said heat and massaging places where cancer has grown can stimulate it to grow again. Has anyone ever heard of this? Dogs in snow are the best. They always play like they've never seen it before and get hyped up. Tanya ",

It frightens me but then there is always a post to follow with encouragement to live each day fully.

Lynne 50's...so concerned to hear of your progression. I hope your appt. goes well and you can stay on the meds that you prefer. Changing anything in this fight is scary. Happy you got to ski. I never did it but watched my DH and children do it. I was pregnant so just observing the fun, standing at the bottom of the mountain - smiling. Micmel I'm so sorry that you are ill. Did you call your DR.? Sometimes they prescribe the tamiflu and it will reduce the amount of time etc. Get some rest. Being sick on top of cancer is awful. Eat and drink well. I've been reading everyone's posts. The beautiful picture that MJH shared is indeed a tranquil spot. I imagine that spot as it goes through the seasons each change more breathtaking than the next. Thank you. Mae you always have dinner plans for cooking. So I'm going to take your motivation and go make some chicken soup for myself and my DH. He loves to come home and smell food. Yesterday I went out with my DD and my two brothers and their mom. We ate at a local restaurant and just had normal table conversation. The food was delicious and we all tried each others dishes. It was a loving gesture by my family and it made my day.  Tanya",

For all of the gun owners I chime into and admit that my family of marines-dad and brother, navy-uncle, husband army sergeant have their share. My father was an avid hunter when I lived in the north. As a child I made bullets with my brother on the weekends. Unfortunately, our society today is fraught with multi-layered issues surrounding types of weapons, screenings etc. I imagine anyone could purchase weapons that have nothing to do with a hunting licensed father trying to bring home a buc or moose. I\u2019m proud of our children standing up for what they believe in and finding their voices. I hope the frozen tundra melts mercifully by Wednesday. Grannax and runor I need to put my will in order now to avoid my children not getting their inheritance. It\u2019s mainly the house but I\u2019ve seen and heard so much about the in laws and relatives at the time of death I wouldn\u2019t put it past my family and or some new wife. Grannax and big b home thanks for sharing your stories.Take care of yourselves these events are so traumatic. The scene you painted so dark and eery I don\u2019t know how you had the guts to get out of the car. Scan day tomorrow-terrible nights for the past few days ugh! I went to see about medical M but there were large fees insurance doesn\u2019t cover it. Is that how it is everywhere? What\u2019s a fair price? They wanted $275 for consultation. Has anyone joined the taxotere group lawsuit? I did over the weekend. Hair loss that is permanent on your head eyebrows and other private areas allows you to be a candidate and it has to have occurred more than 2 years ago. Have a wonderful day all. I pray you all sleep well without anxiety and pain. Take care Tamya ",

Lynne NH your daughter is gorgeous and I think they could do a magazine cover with those pine trees and snow with the boots. It's a real action shot. Thank you so much for sharing. Keetmom I am praying for and with you. I have no words really to say. I send you comfort and pray that radiation or chemo will get rid of those mets. This whole entire cancer thing is so frightening too me. Every scanxiety and call from the ONC just waiting. May God bless you and your family. We are here for you. Sending you hugs and sincere prayers. Micmel the days fly by and then you'll be in surgery on a vacay from Ibrance feeling strong. Your grand puppy is past enormous now. Do you still take him for walks? he looks like he'd take you for a walk. 50's girl I hope you're soaking up the warmth and sun with this Chamber of commerce weather we're having. Enjoy. Mae enjoy Netflix. I hope your husband doesn't have too much discomfort. You make beautiful meals all the time so I'm sure you can feed him through this one. Men love good food. MJ good luck with the scans today. i hope you get your results soon and don't have to sit fretting and worrying. My ONC appt went off well. We brought food a nice hot meal to the infusion room. My bloodwork was drawn with one stick (still no port). And the infusion was also one stick. I got my DS a warm blanket and she slept through the entire thing. I even left and went and got my faslodex shots in another room and came back and she was still asleep. lol . She left her phone plugged in and we had to pick it up the next day. Yesterday we went to Anna Maria island which is my favorite beach. Mostly families and regular people. White crunchy sand not too many people on a Thursday. Relaxing and beautiful. I needed this visit. ",

After three surgeries on my spine and a full hysterectomy this past year; sometime in July 2018 I started being brutally honest with people who asked and answered the question, \"you're alright now? in remission? you can beat this you did before right? I started answering with the truth which is such a horrible answer that people look at me mouth agape as if I just dropped an \"F\" bomb. NO I'm not alright. I have MBC there's no cure, I take strong drugs to kill tumors. I take nuclear medicine for a PET scan. I have a port. I'm going to die I just don't know when. There's no cure just medicine to prolong my life, maybe. Now what was it you wanted to say? Tanya",
