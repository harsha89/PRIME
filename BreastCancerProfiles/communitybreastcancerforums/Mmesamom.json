I was told two weeks but my appointment last Thursday (two weeks) was cancelled because the results hadn't come in. This Wednesday I received a phone call saying that genetic results were talking a long time and that hopefully would be back by Tuesday. we are waiting for the results because if it is positive, I will have a bilateral and if it's negative I will have oncoplastic surgery. Today I got consent papers from the plastic surgeon saying that i was giving consent for a bilateral reconstruction with expanders. My questions: does a longer genetic test result mean positive results? Will the surgeon send out the papers for insurance reasons or any other reason besides that being the surgical plan? Will I be able to get through this without losing my mind?
