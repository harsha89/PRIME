    "Content": "diapermaker64 wrote: Has anybody had breast swelling and soreness after lumpectomy and radiation?  I still have swelling and soreness over a year after surgery and radiation.  I had two lumpectomies, 33 rads and did develop mild LE in my arm.  Could the swelling and soreness be from LE?  My surgeon says it is edema from the surgery and it takes a while to heal if you have had rads. How long will it take for this to heal? Would having breast reconstruction be an option to get rid of this? I currently do lymph drainage myself on my arm but it doesn't seem to help my breast. diapermaker Dx 11/20/2008, DCIS, 5cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER-/PR- Log in to post a reply",
