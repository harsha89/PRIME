She has recently had a liver resection and has been off chemo for about 2 months now. Her hair is growing back very fast, BUT... it is growing very curly and thick, AND straight up! Also, her hair is mostly white and when she has tried to color it, the resulting color doesn't really match -significantly!- what was in the box. She thinks it is because of some chemicals in her hair from her old chemo. So, without further a do, here are her questions: 1. Did your hair also grow back much thicker, curlier, and straight up? 2. If you tried coloring it, did you also have a problem with the dyes? Please share your story about hair growth with us and give us any advice you have. We look forward to thinking about less... serious matters, such as hair troubles.  Some days, it is kind of nice to talk about this rather than medications and test results, isn't it? My mom is the one who has BC. Sometimes you're the windshield, sometimes you're the bug Dx 8/14/2009, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, 1/1 nodes, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "May 27, 2011 03:02AM - edited May 27, 2011 03:47PM by cati13 My mother just had a liver resection.She is Stage IV with mets in liver. This is her second time fighting cancer. First time, she was Stage II with one lymph node. It took 10 years for BC to return in August 2008. Since then she has been doing chemo every week, with one week off. She has been working full time. Before surgery: Her tumor had to be decreased, via Taxol and Avastin, until it was 3-4cm long. She had a PETscan, and she had her blood and heart checked out to see if she could sustain the operation. She had to be 6 weeks without Taxol and 4 weeks without Avastin in order to be ready for the surgery. Surgery: The surgeon took about 1/3 of her liver out (I don't remember which lobe). She was in surgery for 4 hours. The doctor also did an ultrasound of the liver to look for more tumors, which he didn't find. He also checked a spot that had shown up in the PETscan, which turned out to be benign. The incision was in the shape of an L from the bottom of the rib cage to the right.  After surgery: she went straight to the ICU. She was talking and making sense shortly after admission. She seemed optimistic at that time. She has been there for 4 days now. The most important issue has been the return of her liver function. It took 2 days for the doctor to say that the liver was stable and seemed to be working properly. He was also looking for signs of hemorraging and/or infection which he didn't find. Everything has been going well and if she continues to be stable, she will be moved to a room this afternoon - day 4 after surgery. Mentally, she has been having a hard time. She was in a lot of pain and we had to ask the nurse to increase her pain meds via the epidural. She was also feeling claustrophobic in the ICU. The worst perhaps was that she was very thirsty and she wasn't allowed to drink water. The nurses provided her with a small, wet cloth to suck and relieve her thirst. This, however, was secondary since she has been doing well medically.   I will post more of her recovery in a few days, so that others can see the full picture of such surgery.   Also see for more info: http://csn.cancer.org/node/163302 Best wishes to everyone fighting cancer. Your courage is admirable. ",

This is how my mother, who is stage IV, coped with it when she was told her cancer had returned after 10 years. She had liver mets and just had surgery done to remove the tumor. Many women with Stage IV live for a long time now. She focuses on living strong until there is a treatment that definitely controls the disease. Make sure you have a good support network and I wish you the best.",
