To answer you, YES, UNFORTUNATELY THIS WAS A BREAST CARE CLINIC!  SHOCKING (but I have to take some resp.  I was warned but I really did not want to give up this surgeon....also a breast surgeon, it's all she does....she is lovely).  OK, I feel like I have taken enough time.  I will call Monday first thing.  I will post as this progresses.  Thank you very much.",

Saw surgeon and now have waited almost a month for today when I suppose to have two kinds of biopsies, core and stereo tactic. God the emotions and anticipation..... Took day off, arrived.  First the ultrasound, too many cysts radiologist decided not to biopsy (not even the one surgeon ordered a biopsy on), I was then moved and prepped for the stereo tactic, lots of trouble as the area of microcals are too close to chest wall and, according to nurse, \"he's probably not going to do this one either, you'll need surgery\"  A lot of pain with pressure from machine on breast.  Radiologist kept ordering more pics. then back and forth to mammograms.  He came in (abruptly) and said the mircocals are layered.  I asked to see what he was talking about (he got all annoyed).  He showed me and said \"benign\"  AND, you have Fibrocystic (sp?) Breast Disease.  I'll tell your surgeon.....He walked me to the door and shut the door once I was just outside it.  I was left standing in a hallway, with no one around, in my hospital gown, without my key to go and get my clothes.....AND I have left a lot out, he was horrible. The experience shocking and all I could do was cry.  I wanted to be happy but I do not know what to feel.   I need help.  I called my surgeon but she is off until Monday.  I don't understand what I am suppose to do now?  NO BIOPSY and after all this scare I am just suppose to drop this?  Will she tell me what to do next?  I have EVERY risk factor, under 50, my mom had same kind with mastectomy, I've had no kids, never breast fed, my microcals are all funny shapes and sizes (appears to be in situ) one outside cluster.  What do I ask the surgeon.  Should I request the surgical biopsy?  Should I wait?  And the layered part, is it always benign?  Anyone?  I feel so lost and I want to feel happy but I am not settled and I am shocked at how this was handled. Am I over reacting? Why do I feel so bewildered when I should be jumping for joy?   How should I communicate with my surgeon?  Has this happened to anyone?  Thanks for listening and for your help.  Log in to post a reply",

Much peace in your journeys.  Carrie",
