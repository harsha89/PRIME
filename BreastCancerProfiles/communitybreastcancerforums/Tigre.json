So you guys are it. Of course, it's possible that I am still living in the state of denial. Or that something else is making me feel so terrible...As it is, my lower back--esp on compromised side and my neck--sometimes the shoulder area are Painful!! I am rebounding--very gently--and wearing the (old!! and only!) sleeve. I recently purchased a camisole that is stretchy and snug which I am wearing at night. I see maybe a little progress. Please tell me I can feel better. You have No idea what I am up against in my Story...! If this IS a 'flare', can I expect any relief? I am even being careful not to eat 'inflammatory' foods...I do have pain meds for this and long time post chemo arthritic-type issues which help but recently it is a 4 hrs span and then I am in them again!! What really tipped me off was my Bestie (double mastectomy/reconstruct 3-2 years ago and has had a lot of this) suggesting that the pain that was moving around in upper right back to shoulder (so that you could Not touch it!!!) might be lymphedema. I groaned at my own lack of diagnostic skill about this and put on my sleeve. The next morning the terrible shoulder pain was some better. It seems to move around a lot, tho, and all of it is much worse in the morning when I first get up. In fact, some mornings, I have trouble when I get up even standing up straight. That seems to be a pointer as well. :/ After sitting up awhile with a warm hot log and a cup of something and pain meds, i can start to move. I am 61 and for this far out in pretty good health otherwise. I have lost almost #40 this last year of cancer/treatment gained weight that would NOT come off. (THM--Trim Healthy Mama came into my life and saved it...I have about 20 to go. Would like to feel well enough to 'cook'!!) Wow. Even reading me further convinces me that we are on the right track. So. An additional concern. I am flying to the West Coast (from Eastern KS) for 10 days between Thx and Christmas. Any wisdom for compression tees, sleeves, newer (please, not expensive!) sleeves. Leggings?? And how about anyone discovering that it might or might not help to wear the stuff for a period of time after arriving to destination. thanks for the replies, ladies...for some reason, I was surprised. And touched. Been feeling a bit alone with all this lately. Thanks again. T.",

I had 5 different malignancies in rt breast (multi-focal presentation), a sentinel node biopsy when it was still a \"study\", rad mastectomy with tram-flap reconstruction followed by chemo. They decided against radiation due to the high number of places and told me they would make it up with the chemo. (arrgh) My tumors were Estrogen-pos, so they wanted to shut things off as quickly as possible. (That was not fun). Anyway, just a framework...Am pretty sure I am dealing with what I have read described as and called 'truncal lymphedema' and what in the hey (where, who, anything!) do I do now? I am wearing the sleeve pretty consistently until I feel better (this is not the first time I have gotten to the point in my denial where I am miserably uncomfortable) and a shaping camisole. I am faithful and gentle with my rebounder which I believe strongly in...But remember! When I was diagnosed/treated, they didn't hardly want you to use your arm for much of anything. But I moved away from that thinking over time tho I have always been careful. One problem is...I am not a big sweller. By that I mean that even with severe broken bones, I had all the color, all the pain, but rarely enough swelling to notice. I may have been dealing with this for some time....? Any input, shared info/experience would be appreciated! Thanks--- T. Log in to post a reply",
