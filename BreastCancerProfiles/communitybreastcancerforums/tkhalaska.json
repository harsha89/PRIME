I am sorting through the 8 types of non-malignant conditions that were present, there may be a recommendation to go ahead and do a surgical excision just to be on the safe side, and I am perfectly OK with that!",

I don't think I would let this go just yet. I find it concerning that a provider would document \"9mm spiculated hyperdense asymmetry\" and then say \" never mind\". Please speak with them and arrange some further testing, like an ultrasound and MRI. If you do not feel that your provider is responsive to this, then get a second opinion. I have a 10 mm spiculated mass that is only visible on MRI, and is not seen on either mammogram or ultrasound and also cannot be felt. I am awaiting my biopsy results today. This may all come to nothing, and I hope it does. However, the other option is deal with something small and early now, or something larger and more extensive later.",

It was discovered that I do not have Brca 1 or 2 but do have MSH6 mutation, which is associated with a lot of other cancers but not necessarily breast cancer. Because of this history and finding I have a yearly MRI and mammogram, so an exam of some sort every six months. I had my MRI last week and a spiculated mass 10mm x 11mm with mixed kinetics was seen. I was told it is rated Bi-rads 4. There was no unusual structure or activity noted in the lymph nodes. I am having a mammogram and ultrasound on Thursday and am seeing the surgeon on Friday for a consultation/discussion. I have been an RN for 30 years but never in oncology so am preparing and reading up on types of mastectomies. Log in to post a reply",

I have had two false positive mammograms in the last 3 years. In August I had focused studies and US on the left breast that came back OK, the current mass is in the right breast. The fact that this is an MRI and the spiculated nature of the mass is what has me worried. I actually researched the credentials and experience of the radiologist who interpreted my study, and out of the practice of 14 MDs she is the one I would have chosen. I am considering in the event this too is negative I may just have a prophylactic bilat mastectomy given my family hx, genetics and frequency of alarming test results. I am very thankful, though that my providers take this very seriously and that since my right side was clear in August and the mass is small that if it is Ca we have caught it early.",

The ultasound is showing a mass although it measures smaller than the mri. I am seeing the surgeon later today but it sounds like I will have an mri guided biopsy, will have to ask what all this will entail.",
