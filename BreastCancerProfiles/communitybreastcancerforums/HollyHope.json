Blueberry: thank you for sharing your oncotype score.  I am scared of it still even though my MO said it is absolutely a range they see. Below is the link for the organization I'm donating my hair to.  It's been highlighted and color treated.  They prefer non-chemically treated hair 8 inches or longer, but will accept any in good condition. http://www.childrenwithhairloss.us/donate-your-hai... Below is a link I came across for some super cute hats and they are so SOFT and comfortable.  I ordered the gray one and it is well worth the price and came super fast. http://www.etsy.com/shop/GypsyLoveHeadbands?section_id=7321667&ref=shopsection_leftnav_3 Here is a picture of my Tuesday haircut that I am becoming more used to and not as sad about.   You other beautiful ladies inspired me to post is as I think you all look fantastic.  I feel like this is such a great supportive group of ladies even though we just 'met'.  I am grateful for you all!

And Linda - your haircut story is the sweetest!! There are angels all around us. Sharon - your wild ferret comment made me laugh!  I found that a lot of the wigs I tried on had WAY too much going on with the hair in my face and just too much of it! Shellbell - sending positive thoughts your way and hoping it isn't as big of a deal as you thought.  Same for you on Thursday Janet.  I found the whole day to be very uneventful other than being sleepy.  The next 4-6 days were a little fluish feeling for me and then I snapped back to normal.  I pray it is goes smoothly for you both and hoping you are about to turn a corner too Nana! Cold - I am so glad to hear your feeling better!!  Enjoy your SE free days and hopefully round 2 is better now that you know what to expect. Well today is the day!!  I'm shedding so tonight after work my sister in law is going to buzz my head along with my son (10), daughter (7), niece (7) and nephew (4).  My kids were so excited about it this morning, so how could I not be excited along with them.  I've started to notice that without nose hairs I'm getting a drippy nose.  I'll be needing the warmth of my wig and scarfs as it's only now getting into the 60's and 70's here in WI.  My blood work from yesterday showed an increase in my white cells so - yay - I don't feel as vulnerable to infection!  When the nurse called to tell me I also told her about my mouth sores and she ordered me up the Magic Mouthwash and I have to say it's nice.  A lot better than the baking soda/salt wash I was doing and it really helped with the pain.  Have you tried that yet Jen?   Hugs to all my new friends and wishing you all something to smile about today!

Nana - good luck with the cut tomorrow.  You are beautiful now and I'm sure you will be just as beautiful afterwards.  As with all you ladies, I would love to see pics.  I agree with Cold that we have some gorgeous women on our team! Kite - I'm truly sorry you're back here, but glad you posted.  My daughter is 6 and she also was worried about me being bald and her being embarrassed.  Their honest feelings are so normal at this again as it's hard for them to process the bigger situation.  I just really involved her in the process and she even ended up helping to buzz my head.  I was a little unsure of her reaction when I picked her up at daycare with just my new hat on and it didn't phase her one bit.  I hope that will be the case for your children as well. Swissmiss - I hope you start feeling better about your hair. I get it!! Today I commented on a friends Facebook status and I saw my old profile picture of me with long blonde hair.  I was a little shocked and said to my husband that I no longer knew who that girl was.  The picture was taken less than a year ago. :-( Footballnut - You are so CUTE!! I love your haircut.  And I'm with you on the weight gain.  I've gained a few pounds that I'm not real happy about.  I googled how much cc's weigh today on my phone thinking that would make me feel better.  My new boobs are about a pound each, but then my husband reminded me that I no longer have the weight of the old ones.  Oh well!!! Sunshine - sending strength your way my friend (for chemo and the hair situation)! Merg - you can bring pretty much anything with you.  I like my smart phone (and charger)!  And of course the hubby.  Today I slept through over half of my treatments (about 1 1/2 hours).  My Onco center has a fridge if you want to bring snacks, but they also have some things there. Mmtagirl - I seriously thought your wig was your pre haircut photo!!! It looks so great and real and your beautiful facial feature really pop in the shaved photo!  I have noticed that with every one of you ladies.  Interesting how having hair actually distracts from our natural beauty of our faces! ",

It looks like most of you are all getting through.  It's hard to believe we began chemo back in April now. I am happy to report that my last round of TC was 6/9 and can share that my energy is really back a month later.  I was wondering how long it'd take, but I'm really starting to feel more like me again :-) Next up is TE to implant surgery 8/25...yay!!  I hope you are all able to enjoy a little summer. Hugs!! Holly",

I copied your saying a few posts back about putting your crown on and walking away like a boss and posted it to my facebook - I LOVED it!!  I remember so many days just wanting so badly to feel like myself again and have the energy I did prior to my surgery and chemo.  I was worried it'd be different or less than I had before - I really hope to give you all some encouragement when I say that it's slow, but day by day you start feeling a little better.  There might be a few set backs, but I promise it really does happen!!! :-)  Congratulations to you also on almost being done!!! AND THE NEW CAR!!! You look fantastic! Now I just need to get used to these chemo induced hot flashes - whew!!! I used to be such a freeze baby (especially here in WI), but oh boy....I've become a furnace.  Kudos to you ladies who have \"been there, done that\" through menopause (or from chemo) and I know what I'm talking about! ",

I started back to work this week and I'm tired, but I can do it.  Compared to where it was, it's so much better now.  I really does get easier and most moments I am feeling really great.  Just those darn hot flashes sneak up on me.  I'm sure I'll get used to them eventually.

I think we're so on trend here ladies! :-) Swissmiss, Apple and Jen - I actually felt better after shaving my head.  I knew I had to do it or I'd be also have a mess of hair all over.  You may be very surprised by how you end up feeling.  For me it was like taking control over my situation, not the other way around.  It was very positive.  With that being said, I KNOW how HARD it is though and I wish I could give you each a hug! Nana - your story is so sweet!  I really love hearing things like that.  I'm sure she was with you at that moment. :-) Linda - YOU CAN DO THIS!! We all believe in you and are here for support!  I had round 2 today and so far I'm really sleepy again and my taste buds are off.  My MO said to expect the same SE's this time around and that fatigue was cumulative, meaning it would just keep getting worse with each treatment.  So instead of turning a corner around day 5-7, I can expect 7-10 days this time.  Boo - I hope that's not the case. I just had to stop by though for a quick check in/update with my sisters.  Hugs and prayers to all of you and the wonderful medical professionals taking care of us! xoxo, Holly",

I'll also share that about 3-4 weeks after my last chemo I went through a really 'blue' phase of just feeling down and depressed.  It really surprised me!! I mean here I was, all finished with chemo and cancer free and I was feeling down and sorry for myself.  What the heck was that?!?!?  I guess I was just so focused on each \"next\" chemo treatment that there were some feelings in there that needed to come out.  Anyway, I share in case it happens to anyone else.  Thank God it was short lived - maybe 3-4 days. Congratulations Nancybel!!! Yay!! and Cold on Friday!! :-)",
