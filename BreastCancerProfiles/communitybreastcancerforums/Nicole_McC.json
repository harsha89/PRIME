But back to my point, sorry for digressing.  Everything that I have read about or my doctors have told me is that I being triple negative and the aggressiveness of the growth that I have do not have a very good prognosis.  I even had the genetic testing done and they could not find a link as to why I got breast cancer.  So I am right with you in worrying if I will have to go through this all over again.   ",

It is VERY devasting to find out the triple negative results.  As my loving DH told me, I can't do anything the easy way....LOL!!!  and  he is right.  I can't do anything the easy way, I guses that is just who I am.  LOL!!! As crazy as it sounds, being diagnosed has put my life a little bit clearer in my \"eyes\".   I take each and everyday and appreciate it as if it were my last.  If anything, cancer has taught me to NOT sweat the small stuff.  And laughter is an EXCELLANT tool in recovery.",
