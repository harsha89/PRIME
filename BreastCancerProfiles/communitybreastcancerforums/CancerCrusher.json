This past week my throat has started hurting, The area being treated is my neck bones so my doctor warned me about the throat pain before. Im drinking a lot of coffee, tea and soup to help it. Im not worried cus I know its a normal side effect but I am just wondering how long I should expect the pain and difficulty speaking? I don't want to wait. Addie the Cancer Crusher!
