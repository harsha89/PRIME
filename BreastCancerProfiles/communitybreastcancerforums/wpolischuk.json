I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, 7.5 cm tumor, positive nodes, ER+/Pr+  grade 3. I had a mastectomy, axillary dissection, AC/T chemo, radiation, 2 years tamoxifen, 3 years aromasin.  I was 41 when I was diagnosed, premenopausal. Before I went on aromasin, I had a hysterectomy and oophorectomy which put me immediately into menopause. I am now 49 years old and cancer free. So it has been over 8 years now.  I  had scares of recurrance during my first 5 years post-dx .. I had several bone scans, a head CT, chest x-rays, abdominal ultrasounds. Everytime I was terrified. But now, I can say, for the last 2 years or so, the fear of recurrance has subsided. I am almost complacent. I rarely think about it.   I feel great. I lost over 40 lbs, people say I look great, the fatigue and chemobrain has subsided and am I living a full life. So, does the dread ever go away? For me, I never thought it would, be it did. It started to fade once I was only going for follow-up every year and I stopped taking aromasin. It was like it was over I thought. I still go for mammograms on my one boob, and I look after myself. But, the elephant in the room has shrunk to take just a small spot on the mantle, and not fill the enter room. It will happen for you. Just breathe Wendy  ",
