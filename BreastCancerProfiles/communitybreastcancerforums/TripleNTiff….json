Maybe that's telling me I talk to much? lol I'm so happy to hear your u/s went well. That's wonderful! Thank you so much for the exercise advice. I will start those regularly. I do exercises now but probably not as often as I could be doing. I get my CT scan on 11/5 so I will update ASAP. Praying its exactly as you said and just a funky bra or something. I've not had breast reconstruction or started it. My BS felt that implants 'could' interfere with the radiation treatment. Plus, I'm not sure I want the surgery. I've got two littles who need me at home and they both love to be in my arms a lot. Plus, it's so hard to find help during downtime after surgery. Thanks again, Debra. Praying for you, Tiffany",

I feel lost in a sea of information but yet could not find the info that I needed ha :) I am only wearing a BMX bra right now, a friend gave me, without the forms inside. Just to keep things from rubbing or irritating my staples/stitches. I go Friday to have staples/stitches removed. I anticipate the drains coming out then too as I am hardly having any fluid there now. Will definitely check out the bra fitting in 6 weeks as you suggested Ariom. And, BayouBabe, we have a Joanne Fabrics here. Thanks for that suggestion and the insurance info. I was able to get procedure codes so I can call my insurance company today and find out how much they will pay so I won't be too suprised when I finally do go to purchase one. Again, thank you ladies so much and have a blessed day! Tiffany",
