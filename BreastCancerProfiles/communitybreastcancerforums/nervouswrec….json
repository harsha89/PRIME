Each year I go for a mammogram of my left breast and then a follow-up with my surgeon and each year I am freaked out. This year they did the mammogram, then did spot compressions, then did an ultrasound (I was totally freaked out by now!) and I was told I have 2 minimally complex cysts and 1 simple cyst and that I should return for a follow-up ultrasound in 6 months. This was on Friday and I am being consumed by my thoughts. I do trust my surgeon when he says it is fine to wait 6 months but my mind keeps going to the absolutely worst places. Last night (always the worst time for thoughts) I had pretty much decided I should go get a left mastectomy too. I know I am so lucky, why can't I get a hold of myself?",

Every time I have to go for a mammogram on my other breast I am a nervous wreck. Last time I went, they had to do additional images and then give me an ultrasound which revealed 2 or 3 small cysts, one of which was minimally complex so now I have to go for another ultrasound in 6 months. I am starting to wonder if life would be easier and less stressful with another mastectomy. I think it would be nice to be not have to wear a bra and prosthetic because I am not comfortable with the lopsided look in public. I met my husband AFTER I had the first one and he has no problem with it although I must admit I would definitely miss the sexy sensations that I have experienced since meeting him! Any thoughts would be appreciated!",
