I finally got to go to the Dr today. My lump is 3cm wide and 4cm long. I have read some scary stuff online, seen pictures and watched videos. Until now I haven't been able to discuss my situation with anyone that has been through it. The reason it took so long for me to finally get in was because I was waiting for my health insurance to kick in before I had it checked. I lost my job on Nov 17, 2011. I did find a United Way program in my city where they provide free mammograms. Took a month to get an appointment. I ended up having a complete physical. I had to have a clinical breast exam before they will send me for a mammogram. So now...I'm waiting again! I found out from the nurse practitioner today that the program will go as far as the mammogram but they may not have the funding to go further. I have never in my life done anything like this and am totally at the mercy of these agencies. It's bad enough I had to go through a charity organization to get the medical attention I needed. I am usually the one who gives not recieves. Now, when I start a new job (and I do have prospects) I won't be able to use the insurance because it will be considered a pre-existing condition. If I had known this from the start, I never would have gotten anything going until I had insurance again! If I refuse the mammogram and cancel all attempts, will it be pre-existing or can it be I just got a physical and go in when I am insured? But if I do that and they want my medical records they will see I have a lump. I have been depressed not only because I found the lump but because I lost my job right before the Holidays and now I may not be able to get treatment. Has anyone else gone through this? Or known anyone who has? There is no telling how long it will take to get the mammogram. And all I heard was \"You have to get this seen about right away\". Apparently, from my view anyway, this isn't as important as everyone made it out to be. I have gone into a dark place. I have buried 2 of my children and I never thought anything could unnerve me again but this has. I am ready to take my chances and say forget it. Every turn I make I run into a brick wall. Any advice? And thank you for any answers or suggestions!",
