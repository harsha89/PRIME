So there's always some reason for me to want to keep on trucking .... I'm guessing I will know when it's time to peacefully bow out.  I can't imagine it being anything other than peaceful ... I am not afraid of the dying part, just hate the thought of leaving those that I love.  I hope my onc is honest with me.  He has been my onc for 27 years so I think he will.  ",

My prognosis was pretty dreadful at the time and I remember feeling pretty bummed that the kids would be losing me but I'm still here 24+ years later. The kids are now adults and have been an important part of my fight to survive! None of us know for sure how long we have. Enjoy your pregnancy and your life!! Glenna",

I liked all of your names except I don't know how to pronounce Rhiannon or Ione so those might be tough for teachers, etc. So much to think about when naming a baby. We adopted and two of our three were foster children who came with names so I didn't have a choice. I remember when you first told us you were pregnant ... how overjoyed we all were for you.

Well beyond the 31 days of breast cancer awareness month, I am aware. Getting up from my desk at work, my joints are stiff and achy, a side effect of the hormone therapy I will be on for 10 years. I hobble like a woman beyond my years until my hips, knees and ankles are warmed up and the discomfort dissipates. A colleague asks, \u201cDid you hurt your leg?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m okay,\u201d I reply with an embarrassed half-smile. Beginning with my first stiff steps out of bed, I am reminded. Sitting on a mat, I pull up a compression sleeve and hand garment. With 21 lymph nodes removed from under my armpit, the lymphatic system in that area has gone from a superhighway to a two-lane country road. To help prevent swelling of my arm and hand, I wear compression garments during physical activity. When I join a new yoga class, the instructor looks around and peacefully inquires, \u201cAny pain or injuries?\u201d I ignore the question, not wishing to draw attention. She zeroes in on me, glancing at the compression sleeve, and whispers, \u201cAny injuries?\u201d \u201cSurgery, radiation and lymph node removal.\u201d I turn my focus to my breath and attempt to clear my mind. I am grateful that my \u201cchemo curls\u201d have a Shirley Temple bounce to them and that growing my hair back has not been as awkward-looking as expected. \u201cI love your hair! I wish I had the guts to cut it off like that.\u201d I recognize the intentions behind these compliments, and I am always grateful for them. But I am reminded. When I arrive early to receive a monthly injection of a pellet in the subcutaneous tissue of my belly to suppress my production of estrogen, the nurses decide this would be a good learning opportunity for a new nurse. The needle used to insert the pellet is large and can be difficult to administer. As a result of the switch in nurses, I wait longer than anticipated and miss an activity I had planned to attend afterward. I ask to speak to the head administrator at this world-class New York cancer hospital. Nothing will change if people don\u2019t speak up, I figure. In reality, it\u2019s a buildup of frustration after more than two years of constantly waiting for oncology teams that are overworked and understaffed. The administrator meets me and kindly advises that I not schedule anything for at least two hours after an appointment time. I find this unacceptable, yet I realize that no matter how hard I try, my life for the foreseeable future will be dictated to some extent by medical appointments. I step out of the shower and glance at myself in the mirror. My left breast sits slightly higher than my right, a result of the 28 radiation treatments to my chest wall, supraclavicular lymph nodes and breast, and it is cooler to the touch than the rest of my body. A keloid scar, under which the port used to administer my chemotherapy once sat, is visible over my right breast. Below, a belly that resembles an early pregnancy bump greets me, the result of weight gain after I was thrust into chemically induced menopause at the ripe old age of 26. This new body still surprises me, and I am aware. In January, I start a new, full-time job. Intermittently, I begin to experience dizzy spells. Knowing that the aggressive form of breast cancer I was treated for likes to spread to the brain, worry creeps in. I mention the symptoms to my oncologist, who reassures me that it is probably a case of my doing \u201ctoo much, too soon.\u201d But she orders a brain scan to be sure. I don\u2019t tell my family, choosing not to (hopefully, fingers crossed, knock on wood) unnecessarily worry them. Instead, my boyfriend and I go get the scan on a chilly winter evening after work. It\u2019s clear, and I breathe a little easier the day I receive the results. I am acutely aware. At work, while discussing our organization\u2019s 401(k), a colleague innocently asks how much I contribute. Caught off guard, I reply that I don\u2019t. She takes the opportunity to elaborate on the merits of investing while young. I respond that I\u2019m aware of that and contributed healthily to my previous retirement plan. I leave out the part that I don\u2019t contribute because I\u2019m not convinced I\u2019ll be around to enjoy the fruits of my financial prudence. This is what my breast cancer awareness looks like. Not just in October, but every day I and countless others who have been diagnosed are reminded, made aware. It\u2019s not rosy, it\u2019s not always bald and smiling, and it\u2019s not over once our hair has returned and our cheeks lose their steroid puffiness. With the world awash in pink, I\u2019d like to change the conversation around awareness and share this information: Despite the promise that \u201cearly detection saves lives,\u201d the actual number of Americans dying of breast cancer annually has been around 40,000 since at least the year 2000. In fact, close to a third of all diagnosed early-stage breast cancers go on to metastasize \u2014 that is, return as incurable \u2014 with people in that group having a median survival time of 18 to 24 months. And even with all those pink ribbons, only about 2 percent of research money goes toward metastatic breast cancer. Taking inflation into account, the budget of the National Institutes of Health has decreased by more than 20 percent since 2004, which has a direct impact on the grants that the National Cancer Institute doles out as well as on young scientists deciding whether to pursue careers in research. So, this month, I encourage breast cancer awareness to be translated into action. Perhaps this means donating to such organizations as Metavivor, a volunteer-run Maryland-based nonprofit that directs all of its donations to research. Maybe it\u2019s being a more informed consumer of pink products: How much of a product\u2019s profits are given to breast cancer-related charities, and what are those charities\u2019 objectives? And action doesn\u2019t have to mean spending money; write your elected representatives to vote for and support medical research funding, or deliver a meal to one of the 162,000 women living with metastatic breast cancer. I am grateful that I was diagnosed with a disease that garners so much \u201cawareness,\u201d when many other diseases are given so little. But now is the time for action.

I do talk about it openly and get lots of support from friends, family, and church. I have had many people over the years say really stupid things to me but I can't let it get to me when I know they are saying things out of love and most of the time, people just don't know what to say. I've said some dumb things in my lifetime that I didn't know hurt people until later. I didn't intend to cause pain but I did. I find that I am constantly teaching people about stage IV cancer. My daughter honestly believes I will lick it because I've tried to teach her to be more positive in her life (talk about negative nelly). So, this she chooses to be positive about. I understand her reasoning so can't be upset with her. She doesn't want to lose her mama. Anyway, I have melt downs, I have fears, I am not always positive. I don't believe being positive cures cancer but it does help me to feel better, happier, more fun to be around so I choose carefully who I dump on when I'm having a bad day.

So many times I have said idiotic things that I wished I could reel back in. I truly didn't mean to say something hurtful, or stupid, or inappropriate but honestly, sometimes we don't know the right thing to say and in our attempt to say something, anything, we say the wrong thing. I do have some pat answers when some of those stupid things are said to me. I think there's even a thread with responses floating around here someplace, i.e., \"No, I'm not strong, your hero, brave, etc .... I have NO CHOICE.\" Although I do believe there are some hateful people out there I think most people mean well and if they knew what they were saying was hurtful to us in anyway, they would be mortified. I guess I'm just glad that people care enough to try to say something. We all have those people in our lives who can't face our diagnosis and just walk away.",

I know there are non-Christians out there who may scoff at this but it could be looked at similarly without the god reference, I.e., in the back of my mind I keep thinking there's something still that I need to do. Sometimes I think it is with my adult kids since they still seem to need me. Sometimes I think my mom needs to go before me to keep her from the grief of losing a child. I don't know and I'm just rambling. Sometimes I just look at dh (unfortunately an alcoholic though highly functioning) and feel he is my unfinished project. Whatever it may be, I think it is good for me to still feel I have a purpose, especially since i did retire on disability. It just helps me to stay positive. When my kids were really young I was driven by the need to see them get older. I would be so busy with them during the days that I never had time to get sad. But oh, those nights. I would lay awake and worry about everything I could possibly find to worry about. I would cry and ask my husband the \"why me, what have I ever done\" questions. The questions that have no answers because shit just happens. I would get it all out of my system and awake to start another mommy filled positively sunshiny day. I think because I've had such a good, long run that my kids think I WILL live forever. No matter how I explain stage IV to them, they hang on to the fact that I've beaten the odds before and I can do it again. I think that the day will come when I just don't want to fight it anymore and I worry that they will think I've given up. I don't want them to see me that way. I would like to be strong up to the end but know that at some point it will be out of my control. Ah, the ramblings of a cancer patient who can't sleep because of the worrying. Forgive me ....",

My mom made me this fruit salad back in 1987 when I had the big guns (5FU, adria, methotrexate, cytoxan) and I loved it. Drain a can of pineapple chunks. Mix a package of vanilla instant pudding in with the pineapple juice. Then put any kind of fruit you like in and mix it together.

I sometimes wonder how long it had been lurking in my lung. I think shortness of breath goes with the territory. I stay pretty busy but usually have to rest even after getting showered and dressed. Pacing myself is the key. Work a little, rest a little, play a little, rest a little. My pain is in the lining of the lung.

I'm celebrating 5 years this month and am feeling good, traveling when I can, spending time with family and friends. Although I spent some time getting prepared for the \"what-ifs\" I am finished with that now and concentrating on living. I have been on aromatose inhibitors (like aramidex), faslodex, xeloda, and am now on my 4th chemo. My doctor keeps telling me there is plenty in the arsenal. I understand where you are right now, honest, but as time goes on and you adjust to your treatments, things will start to look up. There are many women on the boards who have been around for a very long time. My lung mets are now stable (not growing) and I'm hoping my next scan will show NED (no evidence of disease). NED doesn't mean cured and it doesn't mean I can stop chemo but it is a very good sign that the chemo is doing it's job. And who knows, maybe a cure is just around the corner. I'm 62 and won't give up!! Glad to see this thread is active again!",

I took it for about 5 years after my first bout with BC in 1987. I had chemo induced menopause (best SE of all) when I was 38. I really didn't have bad SE's though some mood swings (menopause or tamoxifen?) and of course, weight gain. I've gained about 40 pounds since 1988 but everyone says I carry it well! Of course I've gone up and down a few times and changed sizes a few times as well, but hey, I'll take weight gain any day over nausea!! After tamoxifen I was on femara for quite a number of years. I think I did have a break between the two but it was so long ago. Diagnosed with mets about a year after stopping the femara. I often wonder if I had stayed on the femara would I still have gotten the lung mets. Does no good to wonder at this point. I put my energy into having as much fun as possible. It sounds like you have a lovely life! I just came back from spending time at my mom's in Florida. They have 10 acres next to my step-sister who has another 10. She has 6 horses and it is nice to sit on the swing and watch the horses in the field. Having that much land would be too much work for me. I used to love to mow and work in the garden but I do have breathing issues now and just can't do it anymore. Taking a slow, easy walk is more my speed! Your son sounds like a wonderful young man and you sound like a very proud mom. It sounds like he comes to see you whenever he can. How far away is his university? Alesia, how are you doing? Sounds to me like your cancer is pretty slow growing though I'm not a doctor or nurse. It didn't show up in the other lung for 8 years. I would think that was a good thing. Sounds like you are getting good treatment. I know how scared you must be, but believe me, you aren't going anywhere anytime soon. You will find lots of information on the threads and lots of support. Because you are so new, you might want to start your own thread. You will probably get more responses that way. Sometimes people forget about some of these threads that have been around awhile. Also, if you read something and want to ask questions of someone, click on their name and you can send a private message. We are here to help you so don't be afraid to ask!! Hugs to all!",

The best thing is the good news I got from the pet scan I had yesterday. For those who remember, I had a ct scan right after thanksgiving that shows nodules in my liver. Onc and radiologist diagnosed it as liver mets. Pet scan says NOT .... No lights showing anywhere other than some new growth in the lung so ONC would have changed my chemo anyway. I am still in a bit of shock since I was thinking the worse, of course. I never even thought that those nodules could be benign, and I am usually so positive. I guess dealing with this thing for 6 years has dampened my optimistic spirit a bit! Yes, Mrs, M, CT was how I was originally diagnosed with lung mets. I had chest pain and thought I needed a cardiologist. My onc was more worried about lung mets and was right on. I also have been on a fentanyl patch since the thanksgiving incident. It was pain the day after that sent me to the hospital and the reason the onc ordered the ct scan that showed the liver nodules. My pain was so bad I just kept popping oxycodones and was really worried when they didn't touch the pain. It had previously been well controlled by oxy. It is also in the rib area. Onc has said it is from the Cancer being in the lining of the lungs but also said this last time that it could be caused by the nodules in the liver pressings against the diaphragm. The fentanyl patches work most of the time but I occasionally add an oxy",

If you aren't comfortable with the doctor who replaced your original oncologist, try to find someone else. It is better to have a doctor you have confidence in. You will feel less scared when you know what you are dealing with and get started on a treatment plan. We're here for you. Let us known how the biopsy turns out. The procedure is not difficult ....

It was a constant pain but bothered me mostly at night when I would slow down activity-wise. I felt like I might be having heart problems and asked to be referred to a cardiologist. My Onc at the time suggested she was more worried about Cancer recurrence and sent me for a ct scan. She was right, unfortunately. That was May, 2008. I had the fluid drained one time and have never had the problem since. Pain yes, from pleural effusion, no. Hope you can get to the bottom of the problem and relief from the pain BTW, Brenda, I checked with my chemo nurse today. I was on carboplatin April through November and started abraxane on dec. 17, 2014. I was confused because when I was sick from August - October with bronchitis/pneumonia, I was taken off chemo. Counts weren't good enough for quite a while. When I started up again he put me back on the carboplatin. For some reason I thought it was a new drug. After Thanksgiving I ended up in the ER with lots of pain and had a ct scan. At that point there was progression and he decided a change in chemo was needed and abraxane was it! Looking at my list of treatments its no wonder I was confused! Up on my decadron high tonight. Hope I get some sleep! Do you start Friday?",

I was first diagnosed with bc at 37 and am now 65. My recurrence was in 2008, eight years ago. I though stage IV meant I was near death but my doctor said I could live ten years or more. Of course I didn't believe him, but here I am. I am also ER+ pr+ her -. You can see from my history the many different treatments I have been on, My oncologist had me on hormonals for the first three years then chemo for the next five. He has just put me back on a hormonal to see if it will work for me again since I have been away from hormonals for a number of years. Believe me, I look forward to the break from chemo. I do have coughing spells from time to time but not as much as I would expect with having lung mets. Mostly when I lie down to go to sleep. I end up sleeping on several pillows so that I am at an angle. I like werther's caramel candies and carry them I my purse to help with the coughing. My biggest problem is from shortness of breath. I can't walk and. Talk at the same time, sometimes I have to rest after doing even the most simple chore. Stairs are difficult. But I carry on. I spend as much time as I can with my grandchildren and my friends and family. My sister prays for a miracle for me. I think eight years is pretty miraculous and I am not even close to checking out! Who knows how long we will live? No one, really. But they keep coming out with new treatments or theories about different ways to use the old tried and true drugs. We may still be corresponding in in five more years ... Let's go for it! my best wishes to you, Maedchen, and all of us with lung mets!",

I can sure understand your cynical feelings. My onc has always been more upbeat than I am and I am pretty upbeat. Whenever I have progression he says things like \"we have plenty of weapons in our arsenal\" and changes my chemo. In the beginning he said I could live 10 years or more with BC mets. I didn't believe him then, but do believe him now. I'm 65 and I know he is older than me. I'm worried he will retire ... He's been my doctor since 1987 except for a time period when he went to Singapore to open a Johns Hopkins Cancer clinic. He was gone for a number of years but I was in remission then. Anyway, I digress. I believe in abraxane (or any chemo from the taxane family) and I believe in you",

I actually thought I may have had a stroke and went to a neurologist. Wasted a lot if $ on MRI's when my onc probably would have known right away what it was. Robin, get the best onc in your area. Very important to believe in the doctor who is going to be keeping you alive for a very long time! Definitely hormonals for as long as they work. I did them for three years before moving on to chemo. Changed when the side effects became unbearable or there was progression. There is a lot of stuff out there. I'm six years out and still trying new chemos! Delirium, I'm only a day behind you. My next treatment will be dec. 26 and the next Jan, 2. Today went well but I am having trouble sleeping ... Could be because I had a nap today when I got home. Sorry you got kicked off your trial but more sorry that the MRI showed progression! I am having the pain problems, too. That's what put me in the hospital. I couldn't get it under control. Thought I was going to go crazy! Namaste, sorry your Cancer came back so soon after your surgery. I was on tamoxifen and femara for many, many years. My onc thought I'd had enough so took me off. Wasn't long before the lung mets diagnosis. I often wonder what would have happened if I had stayed on the meds. The only major problems I had were weight gain. I also have had neuropathy since my first bout with Cancer in 1987 and don't know if that lingered because of the chemo or the hormonals. It isn't bad bad and I've gotten used to it. I did tamoxifen again somewhere in my 3 years of hormonals. I do feel like they are easy drugs compared to some of the other hormonals but we are all different and others have had lots of side effects. Jab, yes to the pleural thickening and calcification. Sorry you had to join us. I love your quote .... Something for all of us to live by!! Sky lotus, yeah for the xeloda working on your brain mets, too! Any regression is a good thing.

June 15-22 back at the beach with my sister, her 3 granddaughters, my grandson, and a niece. My son and his family will join us for a couple of days. Then sister and all the girls are heading to Niagra falls and Stratford Ontario. We will see Romeo and Juliet at the Shakespeare festival. As soon as I get home from that a good friend from high school is coming for a short visit. In July heading to finger lakes region of New York for a wine fest. Mind you, this is while getting chemo 3 Wednesdays of every 4!! My slogan is \"have immodium, will travel.\" After the wine trip I think I will relax a bit!!

Just got back (yes, off again) from taking son and grandson to Busch gardens and water country in Williamsburg, Virginia. Busch gardens is a huge amusement park with lots of rides and shows. We rode ALL the roller coasters. It was great fun. I'm probably going to have back pain today but it was worth it to see my grandson having such a good time. I'll try to post a picture later. Sorry for all of you with migraines .... I can't even imagine. I feel very lucky to NOT have that problem. I've had a few in my lifetime and the pain was unbearable. Hope they lessen as you adjust to the meds. Off to spend the day with my grandson. E We have him til Sunday night.",

When I had it in 1987 I also had adriamycin and vincristine with it! I had it every week for 16 weeks and it was pretty rough. The 20 years cancer free made it worthwhile!!",

Back to chemo today.  Rode every roller coaster and forgot all about my pain!  LOL! Carolben, you are doing the right thing by hanging on the couch when you feel the need.  Listen to your body!!  And no guilt, ever!! I can't believe they didn't weigh you, Carrie. They always weigh me before every chemo and the dosage depends on the weight. I have had to have dosages reduced a couple of times due to low counts. Blondie, I totally understand your decision to end treatments.  The time you spend with your family is so precious and it is important for you to feel as good as possible.  I think we all need a break from chemo from time to time.  We just need to feel normal. I've been hearing good things about the abraxane, Brenda.  Hope the SE's aren't too bad and it kicks that stuff out of your lungs!! Scary stuff, Surfdreams.  I always worry that I'm going to run out of protocols but my onc says there's plenty left.   Yeah, CarolSue, keep hanging with the stable boy!

Skylotus, hugs to you.  Hoping the rads do the trick and zap those brain mets.   Beckers, Sadly I have no advice to give.  I do have cancer in the pleura and it can be painful.  I take oxycodone just about every afternoon and evening and clonazepam to sleep.  I hope things go well with your mother.  I've been receiving treatments for 6 years and am doing pretty well.   Never heard of metastasectomy.  Will have to research it.  My onc has told me over and over, no surgery.  He says the cancer is already out of the gate and surgery on the lung might cause me more harm than good.  I did have a right lower lobectomy in 1989 for a primary cancer.   Hope I didn't miss anyone.  This is always the first thread I come back to when I've been away.  Hugs to you all ....

My ONC knew right away something was up since I rarely complain about pain. He admitted me to the hospital. I had a ct scan and got the results on Saturday. 4-6 new nodes on the liver, suspicious for liver mets. Two of them near the surface of the liver and pressing against the diaphragm (which was the cause of the pain). My onc prescribed the fentanyl pain patch which is really helping! Will be getting some more testing and will be changing chemos. I have to get the carboplatin that I had on Wednesday out of my system before starting the abraxane on dec. 17.

Hopeinfitcher, getting a second opinion is as simple as finding another doctor and making an appointment. Of course you should ask around as to who would be a good oncologist to go to. Insurance companies don't seem to have a problem with paying for a second opinion. I see you've been a member since 2009. Is something going on with your current oncologist that has made you feel you need a change? Best of luck to you!",

Everywhere you turn someone is giving you advice about this or that. I think in the end you just do what feels right for you. I took tamoxifen and femara for about ten years following my first bout with BC. My gyn told me she thought I could quit as the research at that time said 5 years was the recommended time. Wouldn't you know, within a year of stopping I was diagnosed with mets in the lungs. Goes to show, you just never know! And we are all so different!

Always such a pain to keep everything neat and clean and then to be prepared to run out for a few hours! Best of luck with the sale. Karen, hope your lungs improve everyday. I have had to learn to live on diminished lung capacity and while it is doable, I do miss being able to run and play with my precious grandchildren. The vacation wore me out because we did so much walking and I was determined to keep up. Got the PET results today. Not exactly what I hoped for but could've been worse. Onc says the tumor is stable but with insignificant progression. I read the report and it seemed a little more than insignificant to me (looked like the tumor had more than doubled in size) but he is always positive with me and I do so appreciate that. I'll have a CT scan next week so he can better determine the sizing and then go from there. He would like to keep me on the low dose taxol because it is so good to me in terms of side effects. Just a girl, it's okay to have bad days. We all do. It is easier of course if we can stay busy and keep cancer out of our minds, but that just isn't always possible. I was at the hospital from 9:15 to 3:30 today .... kind of hard to keep cancer out of your minds when you are living it so often. When the weather is bad and you can't get out, immerse yourself in a book (maybe one that doesn't talk about cancer) and get involved in someone else's life. That always helps me.

We call it having a relationship with the stable boy or dancing with the stable boy in our humourous moments. We are happy to be stable! NED is no evidence of disease. I was NED once, I think when I was on taxotere, but the SE's were devastating and I had to stop. NED means no evidence of disease ... CT's can find no cancer. It doesn't mean we're home free because all of us who have stage IV understand that we can build resistance to a chemo and have to start something new which may not be as effective .... then growth may begin again. We're not home free. I know of some women who have been NED for long periods of time. Then there is Progression ... we don't want to see that. It means the tumor/s are growing or new tumors are appearing elsewhere. This usually means a change in the treatment plan. So, we are very happy to be NED, happy enough to be stable, and not so happy when there is progression. Please, anyone who wants to add to this or clarify/correct any of my statements, please do so!

Getting CMF now, two weeks on, three weeks off. So far, so good. I take the cytoxan by mouth for two weeks starting the first day of my chemo and get the methotrexate and 5FU by infusion. Just had the second infusions Wednesday so I'm on my decadron high and having trouble sleeping. Leaving tomorrow for a 6 day wine tasting trip in the finger lakes region of upstate New York. This trip was planned when I was on my old chemo schedule but I didn't want to cancel since we are going with another couple. Once again, have immodium will travel! Looks like I've packed an entire pharmacy! My onc told me to enjoy the wine!! adnerb, I've been on quite a few different treatments. I started on the hormonals and got some years out of those, they like to try those first as they are pills you take at home and obviously easier than chemo chemo, if you click on my name and go to my profile, you can see what I've been on. I will try to edit to show what worked, if I haven't already done that. The ones I know didn't work was faslodex (if that's the shots) and xeloda, although I can't remember if I was taken off because of side effects or progression. Taxotere kicked butt, as well as adriamycin (doxil) and taxol. I didn't get a long run on gemzar and I'm pretty sure that was because of progression. Easy to do chemo, though, so worth a try. The thing is we all respond differently. My onc keeps telling me there Is plenty in the arsenal and now I'm finally believing me. When I first got the mets diagnosis I didn't think I would be here now, planning a vacation for next summer! Then my granddaughter was 1 and now she is 6 and has a baby sister. I fully expect to be here in 10 years!! Best wishes to all for a great week! I know I will have one, in spite of that pesky mustard gas (cytoxan) that leaves me with such a bad taste in my mouth!",

Had taxotere before that. It's the taxotere that took care of the lung mets and I assume the effusion. Do you get the neulasta shot? I'm going to pray that you get your blood counts up so you can get back to chemo. Blessings, Glenna",

I picked a hotel that was in the \"rent by the hour\" part of town. You could hear through the walls. Needless to say, we checked out and found a very nice hotel not too far away.

I hope your scan gives you good news. Woodburns, the ixempra will be after halaven. I hope I stay on halaven a long time. I would love to have a long run. My onc often leaves details out when he gives me reports. i always request a copy of the report and usually have questions. Well, what about this, what about that. He usually says that is nothing to worry about. I think he wants me to leave with hope in my heart! I'm sorry your bone lesions are back. As far as I know, I only have one in my left pelvic bone. I get zometa every 3 months. I think our husbands have a hard time because they are not in control. I try not to express my fears to my husband because he will want to fix them and he can't.

As soon as I found out my onc was back, I switched to himself. He went to a different hospital so I switched. He is 70 now and I pray his wife spent him out of house and home and now he can't.

Well. After 37 days he's been through detox and is ready to get his life together. I'd like to see that in my lifetime. He has ACA insurance but had to get it reinstated after getting out of jail. Hopefully we can take care of that tomorrow and get him in to rehab. I don't like babysitting a 33 year old. I've been reading lots on an Internet site about heroin and what a hard drug it is to overcome. I pray he can do it. He has two sweet sons who need him in their lives. I took Ritalin to get me through the day and now can't sleep. Go figure! I want to live long enough to see him get along with his life. He's such a caring, sensitive guy when he's not going down his bad road. Challenges, challenges. Keeps life interesting!! Warm weather this weekend now that is something to get excited about!

Was able to go to a couple of meetings yesterday and out to dinner last night with my husband and some friends, slept well, even on the decadron. Sometimes I want to feel some se's to know the chemo is doing some good but then again, it is nice to go about my normal activities. Am taking miralax to keep things moving but that's about it. Onc has upped my fentanyl patch to 50 from 25 and that has been a tremendous help. Maureen, no problems with heartburn. How is it going with your hair? Is it starting to grow back on halaven? Sometimes that happens. Soccer Mom, how are things going with you? You're about a month ahead of me on halaven. Is it going well? Cisco, did you lose your hair? What I read said 50-50. On some chemos I lose mine and on others I didn't. My hair grew on navelbine so I'm hoping to keep what I have on halaven. Re drinking, the literature says no or minimal alcohol. My oncologist has always said drink red wine becaus of the reservatrol (sp?) in it, but I haven't asked him specifically about drinking on halaven. I usually don't drink during chemo weeks anyway, figuring the liver is already working overtime. During my off weeks I usually indulge in a glass or two a night but haven't decided what I'll do this time. The pharmacist at my chemo center did ask me if I had had drinks the night before when my liver counts were high. That did get me thinking that maybe I should do without. Hoping to hear from some of you on halaven. Am guessing the holidays have kept everyone too busy for BCO. I go in spurts myself. Happy new year! Glenna",

You would not have any regrets if you got one. Thanks for the explaining the INR! I've had neuropathy since 1988 but it hasn't gotten any worse than it was then, I'm lucky with all the different chemistry I've had that it is still pretty mild.

I guess maybe it's because I've been doing chemo for nearly 5 years .... You think?? I do think the halaven is easy as far as side effects. As long as I take miralax the first two or three days after treatment I am good there. No nausea at all. Poor appetite but that's been going on a while and I can't blame that on Halaven. I promised myself on Sunday that no matter what I was going to eat three meals a day. Hoping that may increase my energy level. I have a big trip coming up during Easter break with my 11 year old grandson and have to have energy for that. I do have a prescription for Ritalin when I need extra energy but try to use it only when I really need to. My pharmacist cautioned me when he filled it as he was worried I would lose even more weight. We are flying to Jacksonville to visit my brother and his family for a few days then he and I are driving to Sarasota to see the Orioles in some spring training games. Stopping for a couple of days to visit my stepfather. My mom died last summer and he misses her. My sister will also be at my brother's house and she is taking her granddaughter to Kissimmee to see the Atlanta braves play. I'm looking forward to the trip but told my husband to discourage me from planning anymore big trips for a while! Maureen, sounds like you have a super busy work schedule. You and Suzanne amaze me. Glad you were able to take off early today, Suzanne, and do hope you get your needed rest. I understand your fatigue! I did two loads of laundry today and felt that was a big accomplishment! Have a great rest of the week! Blessings, Glenna",

Do you remember your other chemo and what you had on the trial? I've had lots of different chemos. I think you can see them when I post. I was hoping I wouldn't lose my hair but a couple of weeks ago it started coming out. A lot came out, then it stopped. So I guess I've got half a head of hair. Very, very thin. Can't go without a hat or wig. Strange that it just stopped like that. I had a cat scan today and get results tomorrow. Goes without saying I'm hoping for good results. In my heart I feel it's working because I am having some side effects. Specifically major fatigue and minor constipation. I feel tired all the time. Was your original cancer in your right breast?

The decade on they give me as a pre treatment usually causes me to lose a night's sleep. I generally try to take a nap as soon as I get home, knowing I will probably be up all night once the decade on kicks in. If I don't get to sleep too early I ask my husband to just let me sleep. Even if I wake up at 3 in the a.m. It's better than losing a whole night. I have no nausea but do get constipation with halaven. Always better than the big d in my book. Will look forward to hearing how you do. Have really had no other issues. Had the liver biopsy yesterday and woke up at 5 this a.m. With pain. It has pretty much subsided with a couple of oxycodone. They will be sending tissue samples for testing to see if I qualify for targeted therapy, I am praying for that!! I'm sure it will be weeks before I hear anything. I am hoping the halaven knocks your liver lesions right back down and that you respond BIG TIME to being back on chemo.",

Patty leaves tomorrow morning so life will be a little more normal. She's been a great help with my son, since she has 23 years in AA. I am used to getting on line at least every other day or so.

Suzanne, glad that you have had some good days. I'll be thinking of you tomorrow as you do your chemo. I do hope it isn't difficult for you and that you have a good weekend. We went to see the movie \"Race\" today about Jesse Owens life and the olympics in Germany during Hitler's reign. It was a great movie, though having been a runner in my earlier life may have contributed to my liking it so much! Just good to get out and do some normal things. I was thinking I started another round next Wednesday but I don't go back dor my 4th round til March 9 and 16th. I do like having two weeks off. Will try to visit friends next week and finish up some household chores. I'm starting to feel good myself and am getting my appetite back. Hopefully will put on a couple of pounds before my next treatment. Haven't gotten any results from the genome testing but expect that to take a while. Starting to get sleepy so will say good night.

I hope that halaven is good for you if that is your next treatment. I've never done the Palpo but it sounds like it's really hard on blood counts. Maureen, glad you are feeling better and enjoying your week off. Are you two weeks on and one week off? My schedule is two on and two off. I really start feeling well in that 2nd week ...

Hope he has it worked out. So, Maureen is on cisplatin /Gemzar, Phyllis you are still on halaven. Suzanne, are you still on Halaven? I'm usually very positive, Pollyanna-ish, but lately have been really tired and spend a lot of time in bed. Sometimes sawing logs and sometimes just reading or watching t.v. I don't want to say I am depressed, but maybe I am, just a little. I usually want to get up and get busy doing something. Right now, I just feel like I could care less about anything. Don't know if that's because of being in limbo about my next treatment or just tired of treatment! LOL! Being able to see grandchildren is the only thing that is giving me pleasure right now. I am thankful for having friends here that I can say whatever is on my mind to. It helps. Hubby doesn't want to hear it when I start my \"what ifs\". My sister loves me too much and I don't feel I can talk to her because she gets into an emotional state just thinking about losing me.

I believe that is probably our most common experience, no matter what chemo we are on. Don't think there is anything we can do to change it either ... Like you say, it's one of those 3 month things we have to put up with for life. I hope those aches and twinges you are feeling are nothing but anxiety and that your scans give you good news! I've had a good weekend though very tired. Took a nice long nap today which is unusual as I usually have trouble sleeping no matter how tired I am. My bff is visiting from Houston, TX and between she and my husband, I have been pampered all day. We started watching a show on Netflix last night (have already forgotten the name but \"Frankie and somebody\" about two women whose husbands are law partners and leave the wives for each other. It's pretty funny and right now, funny is good. It is good to laugh. I remember reading Bernie Siegel's book \"Love, Medicine, and Miracles\" back in the 80's when I had cancer the first time. He talked a lot about how laughter is good for the immune system. It felt that way tonight. Guess I need to start finding funny stuff to watch and try to get away from all the crime shows! If you watch the news, it seems like the heroin problem in this country is just growing and growing. My son is staying with a very good friend this weekend and has checked in with me several times. I think he is doing well and wants me to know he's doing well. Just praying things work out this week as far as getting him into rehab. Woodburns, sure hope this treatment is one that works for you. All we can do is keep trying and hoping for that one that works for us. I'm hoping the results of my genome testing gives me some more treatment options. Talking about the night sweats and the smell .... I didn't notice any smell at all but next time I'll pay more attention. What I noticed was that both times my nightgown was totally drenched. It was weird that I didn't remember taking my gown off or anything. My husband is turning the heat way down down and it hasn't happened during this round of halaven. Sorry I've gotten long winded. Didn't mean to write a book. Sometimes my keyboard doesn't work well which tends to keep me writing shorter amounts. Tonight it worked. Sorry for you all! Ha! Ha!",

I had my treatment on Wednesday along with the zometa infusion. Sleep cycles totally screwed up with decadron. I took it easy today, just because I could. Suzanne, I do love how fast this treatment is. Even with the zometa I was out pretty quickly. Made a few calls today about having a wig made. May not be an easy thing to do. Sounds like one cutting won't be enough and I cannot ask him do it again. My husband said to go buy a wig that matches his hair! It was such a sweet thing for him to do, I hate for him to think I couldn't do it. My younger son is getting out of rehab on Monday and moving into a halfway house. Hope and pray that goes well for him! It is a good location and close to lots of job possibilities. Good weekends wishes for all! Glenna",

I talked to a wig maker who suggested a halo .... A type of wig that you wear under a hat or scarf. Makes it look like you have hair. It doesn't take as much hair to make one and it is way less expensive. I think I am going to go that route. I took my son shopping at sam's club for food and then dropped him at the halfway house. He looks good and has a positive attitude. A friend picked him up and took him to a meeting tonight. Thanks for your good thoughts. I am really feeling good about this. He even wanted to go see his sister before we went. They don't always have a good relationship. A good sign, I think!",

I do understand that day will come for each of us but just hoping to put it off. Maureen, triple Drats again! I know we all were hoping for good scan results. I am also in that heavily treated phase but my doc keeps saying there's more we can try if I fail on halaven. Combination of flu and chemo must have been horrible for you. Did your doc all about options? Enjoy your week off and prepare for your next Poison! Suzanne, hope all is well with you and your treatment last week didn't cause you too many problems. I saw my doctor today. The results from the genome testing were not what I was hoping for. My cancer doesn't qualify for targeted therapy. The good news is we know we haven't missed anything treatment wise. My doc sent the results to the specialist I saw at Hopkins, to see if there is anything he is missing so we will wait to hear from her. I am also set for a cat scan when I get home from Florida to see how the halaven is doing. He said there are other options suggested by The Hopkins doctor when halaven starts to fail me. The testing was worth a try but I am definitely feeling disappointed. I'll put my Pollyanna outfit back on tomorrow! LOL! On a nice note, My daughter brought granddaughter Delilah over this afternoon and I got to babysit for a few hours. It was lovely. It's hard to believe she will be two months on Friday. And I am still here and having time to get to know her! I'm hoping to sleep in spite of decadron. Took my clonazepam so will give it a try! Blessings, Glenna ",

After seeing me today and telling me my cat scan was stable, he reviewed it with the radiologist who convinced him that there was progression in the lung. Therefore, he is recommending I switch to a different treatment: Ibrance combined with fulvestrant. He will speak with the specialist I saw last fall at Johns Hopkins to confirm this as a possibility for me and call me on Monday. Peripheral neuropathy and low blood counts are major side effects but he feels I will continue to handle those well. He said I have super nerves! Ibrance has direct activity on the cancer and also works to make the fulvestrant work better. He said he will probably start me on a slightly lower dose because of all my bone marrow has been hit with over the years. He had already decided to give me an extra week off because of my fatigue, so I won't have treatment until the 13th. I am glad for the mini break.

There is a smal group here, though sone Of is have ender our time on Halaven we continue to visit the friends we have made. Last night, I corrected my chemo list. When I was adding in the abraxane I noticed that I had been on abraxane before - from December 2014 through July 2015. I'm not sure my onc realized that as they have had a lot of computer issues at the hospital where I go. I called him today to let him know but haven't heard back from him yet. I certainly hadn't remembered. I had the 2nd treatment yesterday, so he may want to change my treatment to something I haven't tried yet. I have done well on the taxanes and was just glad to be getting back onto one of them! Of course if I could get another 7 months I'd be happy! Jennifer, one of the major side effects for me as been lack of appetite. My doctor wrote a prescription for megace which is supposed to help increase appetite. Have taken two doses today and do hope it helps me to eat more. I do drink an ensure milkshake with ice cream and fruit almost everyday and also eat a cottage cheese/flax breakfast mixture that bestbird recommended. It is from the budwig diet. I find I eat more if I eat smaller portions often during the day rather than trying to eat a large meal. Sleep cycles being disrupted by decadron is always a problem for me, hence the middle of the night posts! LOL! Suzanne, so glad the Gemzar went well for you today. Sounds like a fun weekend planned for you with your grandsons. You are wise to plan activities where you get to watch!! Going to the beach with my husband this weekend for some needed fresh air and sounds of the waves crashing on the shore. One of my most favorite places to be. Glimpsing the wild ponies or Assateague is always a bonus! Prayers for everyone to have a great weekend. love, Glenna ",

I once had a Hickman catheter and that tubing came out of my skin and had to be cleaned and rebandages every few days. I would not ever want to go back to that. Also had to flush it with heparin. The port takes no care. The nurses access it for my bloodwork and leave me hooked up for chemo. It doesn't hurt at all when they put the needle in. Honestly, I don't feel a thing. Some people get anxious about it and apply topical lidocaine before they get accessed but I have never needed it. They do flush with heparin after chemo before they pull the needle out. And no, that doesn't hurt either. I reread my last response to you and where I said I hate getting stuck I meant in the arm ....not the port! I hope others will respond to you. I know the pros and cons of ports discussion has been had but don't remember which thread. I do think it would make your life much easier!",

That's good news as far as I am concerned. I met with a specialist last November at Hopkins. She recommended the new biopsy. There's always a chance that the cancer is different. Either way, she thinks I should be looking at targeted therapy down the road since I have gone through so many chemos. She had another recommendation but I'm having brain freeze again and can't remember. I hate when that happens. Hope chemo goes well for you tomorrow. I like how fast the infusion is. Do you get decadon as a premed? That usually keeps me up at night but I'm feeling like I could sleep tonight. Hope so. Smart to take off Friday. Why push it. That will give you time to pamper yourself. You sound ready. I always coat my finger and toenails before chemo too. Don't know if it protects or not but worth a try! Will be thinking of you",

He wants me to start abraxane since I have had good results with the taxane family (other than side effects). I've read over the abraxane thread (which is even shorter than the halaven thread), to find out what to expect. Sounds like nausea could be a a problem and that is something I haven't really had to deal with at all. I usually get pre-treated at the infusion center and never need to follow up at home. I will definitely be prepared for that though, after all I have read on the abraxane thread. Suzanne, hope you were able to get that dentist appointment in. That baking soda regimen sounds easy enough to do. Is it still helping you? I thought I might give it a try. Maureen, how are you doing on the cis/gem combo? I had Gemzar but not in combination with other drugs. If I remember right, I did have a pretty good run on it, Oncologist decided to hole the Ibrance/faslodex in the arsenal for a later time. Phyllis, hope you become the halaven star!! At least one of us needs to get a good run from it! Hope this finds you all feeling good and looking forward to the weekend! Blessings, Glenna",

I don't think I've heard of rigors before but that is what happened, about 20 minutes after treatment. I was still in the lobby and able to get myself back up to the treatment room where the nurses pounced on me. Demerol and Benadryl got things under control. My entire body was shaking/convulsing and my pulse ox was in the 60's, heart rate 162, experiencing severe shortness of breath, lasted about 20 minutes. The decision was made to keep me. Waiting 48-72 hours to see if it is an infection. If so, they will probably remove my port. If not, they will assume allergic reaction to abraxane and change chemo again. Being treated with heavy duty antibiotics in case it is an infection. Whew, it's good to just feel typical chemo crappy. On the good side of things, the hospital food is pretty good. lol",

I know those black areas aren't supposed to be good, but then some of them are supposed to be there and how do you know what is what. I know that sometimes I read my scan results and I think this sounds really bad. I go to the ONC with questions and he tells me everything is great. All the things I am worried about, he is not worried about. So, your fear is real and justified and we're all freaking out with you but we're hoping for the best because we all care for you so much. You've been through so much the last few months and of all people, you deserve a break today!! We'll all be logging on to see how your appointment with the oncologist went. If it's good news, we'll celebrate with you and if it's not, we'll rally around with support, hugs, and news about whatever SE's you might expect from your new treatment. We want to see you bragging about your son's h.s. graduation .... Love Glenna",

I was so busy with work when I got my stage IV diagnosis that I didn't take the time to surf the web. I know it would've been so much better for me had I found you all earlier. I honestly spent a couple of years thinking death was the only alternative. I'm now coming up on 5 years, still going strong, have gotten used to living with chemo, and still treating every day like a birthday. When I think back on some of the wonderful women I have met here who helped me find purpose, I have to smile (and yes, sometimes through the tears). Sometimes I go back to zoh's husband's blog and just seeing her pictures gives me a lift. She was such an inspiration to so many. Every so often her sex thread pops up and I think of how she just shared so much of herself to help others. I wish I could be more like her but I am one of those who just sometimes have to take a short break. I have the hardest time when we lose a sister who is still raising their children. I want to scream about the unfairness of it all. If just one thing I say helps someone, there is purpose to my being here. So many of you have helped me without even realizing it.

This summer I have been to the beach, to Kentucky for a family reunion, Florida to get my mom settled into a nursing home, and leave Friday for a two week trip to Norway. Yes, the article made me uncomfortable. Read many of the comments and some of them made me uncomfortable, too! My oncologist told me upfront that my cancer was incurable but treatable. I am not NED, have had slight progression along the way, but without chemo I would not be here. I would not know my 31/2 year old granddaughter at all. I feel the patient should be given all the facts, all the possible side effects, and be allowed to make that decision for themselves. I have had decent quality of life most of the time and would gladly choose chemo again. P.S. I'm sure my insurance company would have preferred I not respond so well to chemo! LOL",

I think cancer makes me feel I deserve that. Granted, I don't party everyday but I do see friends if I can, treat myself to lunch out, a glass of wine once in a while, dote on my grand kids when they come over. I have learned through al-anon to take care of ME. I didn't do that before stage IV but I do it now! I'm a celebrating kind of person but I will add that I do sometimes have my pity parties. We all have our down days and I certainly have my share of those. I find a soak in the tub with a glass of wine helps .... Or just sitting on the beach wrapped in a blanket enjoying the sounds God placed at the ocean! My onc gave me a gift when I went to him in 2008 with the recurrence. He told me I could live 10 years or more .... That stage IV can be maintained, and that there were plenty of weapons in the arsenal! I've gone through a number of treatments and for various reasons have had to make a change. And guess what, he was telling the truth, there are plenty of cancer fighting weapons in the arsenal! Happy Birthday, Chris, and many more!",

Leading normal lives is what we all want. I worked for 3 years with mets and treatments but retired in June. I am so glad that I did. I now use my energy for fun things instead of on my feet all day working, then coming straight home to sleep. It was fatigue more than anything. I also didn't think it was fair to my students that I took 1 week off every 3 weeks for chemo. If I had small children that I Wanted to spend with when I got home from work, I wouldn't have had the energy ... Or patience for that matter.

Things were probably done very differently then than they are now. With the 2008 recurrence, my onc called me when he got the pathology and I called my DH. I also fired the BS for reasons other than him telling my husband first. He totally botched the biopsy, told me I couldn't feel pain when I did feel pain, and wouldn't let my husband in the room when I was screaming in pain. He was a real arse!!

I think I read on here somewhere that loss of appetite happens because the liver pushes against the stomach, leaving less room for food. I also find that food just doesn't taste good right now. Just started megace which is supposed to increase appetite. Sure hope it does. I feel like I'm starting to disappear and know I need to eat! Lots of folks here I recognize from other threads.

I just had my second Ixempra infusion yesterday. When speaking with my oncologist I mentioned my left leg was bothering me quite a bit so he sent me after chemo for a scan. Called last night to tell me the tumor in my iliac bone was growing and recommended a round of radiation (5-10 treatments). I've never had radiation so am a little apprehensive. Will see the radiation oncologist Monday morning, I haven't seen the ct scan report yet but he didn't mention the liver mets so I'm assuming they are stable. Sure hope this Ixempra kicks them to the curb. Holeinone, my onc doesn't put much stock in the tumor markers. He rarely orders them and says they just aren't a good reflection of what is going on for everyone, they definitely aren't for me. LFF, sticking with the xeloda sounds like a good plan. I wish I could have gotten some time out of it. All we can do is hang in there and hope we have a little bit of luck with each treatment! Other than that, I'm just so sad about what is happening in our country with all these shootings and I pray for sanity. I'm not a gun person myself and understand those who enjoy hunting and shooting for sport but sure don't see why anyone needs these ar type guns. Hoping these riots don't last all summer and we can restore some order in our cities. ",

I also remember reading where someone on one of the threads was given megace as a cancer fighting drug. I was planning to research that but never got around to it, it has helped my appetite a lot and I have gained about 12 pounds or so in the last month to 6 weeks. I feel a lot better. I'm also on arimidex now so feel I will put on some pounds because of that, I wish you could get Dani to drink the ensure. I was so afraid about the weight loss and looked so gaunt I thought I would waste away. Now I tend to grab an ensure when I head out in the morning and really like it, I'll see what I can find out about megace, Support groups can be really good but I'm thinking separate groups for those with mets.

It was the first time I had lost a friend here, on BCO. Since then, there have many who have joined the angel list. I feel sadness everytime but more so when it is a young woman with children. And yes, I do get more anxious when someone dies. Especially during the periods when it seems there are several who go in Very short periods of time. Sometimes I take a break from BCO but always come back because of all the support I find here. I've lost a lot of friends here but I have made many also",

Sometimes I get phone calls or short visits. I think being on the prayer list serves as a reminder that I'm still here, still receiving treatment, and may be a card or visit would be nice. The occasional dinner doesn't hurt, either. LOL, Laurie, I do respect your right to decline if I suggest that I am praying for you. And I totally understand that privacy is important to many of us and having our name on a list could be disturbing. I have been in my church since 1981 and am known by all. It would be difficult to keep my cancer private. I don't believe when I pray that I am trying to control breast cancer and believe that most who pray do so because they have kind hearts. Sassa, I politely disagree with your statement that other's feelings are immaterial .... That's not been my experience at all with people who care enough to pray for someone.",

The day the BS got the results, his office called my DH at work and told him the bad news and to make sure he came with me for the appt. I don't know how my husband kept that news from me and wish that he had told me in the privacy of our home. I could've had questions for the BS instead of sitting there in total shock. Anyway, the procedure for that BS was a follow up appt whatever the news. Prayers coming your way, Glenna",

He said when I stopped abraxane last year it was due to peripheral neuropathy, not that it wasn't working. Also I was going to Norway and asked for a chemo break. He still thinks it is a good course to be on now, at least until the neuropathy gets bad. I'm good with anything that kills cancer cells though I do find abraxane rough compared to some of the other chemos I've tried, so, glad to know I'm not the only one who hides my iPad when I take my naps!

Wish I could say that for other mets! After complaining about a lot of pain in my left leg a scan showed a 3\" tumor on my iliac bone. My oncologist has taken me off Ixempra (it was obviously not doing much if that tumor was growing so fast) and has started me on arimidex again. I have been off hormonals for 5 years and my onc is hoping they may work again after the long break. I was hoping the Ixempra was going to be the drug that got me to NED. Oh well, I've been stage IV for 8 years and am just happy to be around to try new things! Plus having a break from chemo after 5 years is not an unwelcome thing. Have been reading this thread frequently since I have it bookmarked as a favorite. So glad to see it is staying active.

Would he have told you or continued his activities if he hadn't thought he was \"caught\" and needed to tell you? I'm thinking I would feel that the past 16 years of my marriage was a \"lie\" and that betrayal would be very hard to accept. However, forgiveness is one of the tenets I try to live by and I would probably do my best to forgive. That's not saying I would necessarily stay in the marriage. That is a decision only you can make. It is not the same thing at all, but my husband is an alcoholic and I find that having stage IV sometimes leaves me feeling \"trapped\". I know I could leave (and we have separated in the past) but after 39 years together and al-anon, I have learned how to live with him the way he is. Other than his alcohol addiction he is a good man in so many ways. If I were younger, if I didn't have stage IV, if he were abusive, if, if, if, ..... I might leave the marriage. I pray you can find answers for yourself in this mess that he has created. The last thing you need is something besides breast cancer to worry about. Again, my heart goes out to you.

My dad had a credit card and was in his last few months, dying from throat cancer. He needed a reclining chair. I talked him into putting it on his credit card.

Very aggressive chemo through a trial at Hopkins after mastectomy. Then a separate lung cancer in 1989 (never a smoker). Surgery, no chemo. It took me 10 years to really feel I had beat it. Worried at every check up. Hated when they moved my checkups from every 3 months to every 6 months to every year. Totally thought my chest pain in 2008 was heart but found mets to lung. I was shocked. Thought I was home free on cancer. (Ha, didn't know about these boards or I would've known we're never out of the woods). I've been through the AI's, then taxotere (kicked butt) then a 3 month chemo break and now on gemzar for maintenance. I was NOT comfortable during the 3 month break but when I was scanned there was NO progression. I was more than ready to start chemo again. When my ONC told me I could go 10+ years with mets I didn't believe him at first. Now I do. So many women here who have and it gives me hope. So much good advice here and so many who feel that same anxiety when not on treatment. We are not alone in this! My onc is suggesting chemo for 9 months with a 3 month chemo break as long as I'm stable. That is sounding good to me. I'm trying to take some trips when I'm on a break. I'm now two weeks on and two weeks off the gemzar so plan something fun for that week before I start again and I know I'm feeling my best. Retired on disability last June so am able to travel a little. We never know what the next scan will show so I believe we should live life to the fullest while we can ... and if it's 15+ ..... GREAT!!!! I think as long as you're having monthly blood work and maybe ask for an appt with your onc in two months to help you feel you are being followed you will be okay. Enjoy the break and do some fun things to keep your mind of the big C. Sorry this got to be so long. Blessings, Glenna",

She said they would have to remove the port. It is a power port and I have had it for about 5 years. The problem is my weight loss. When I had it put in, I was probably about 160 pounds. I am now 114. So, I am freaking out. I sent a picture to my sister who is a retired hospice nurse. She suggested I call tomorrow and talk to the nurse about getting a smaller replacement port.

I do recall a reduction in dosage at least once due to low counts. Sorry, but chemo brain and the fact that I haven't kept a chemo journal doesn't allow me to help very much.

Hopefully the next one will be the one that works for you. I did taxotere and had to quit because of the side effects. Am now on taxol and it is doing the trick, at least for now.

Going to Ireland in November and looking forward to a long visit in Florida with my Mom in October. I understand the grandchildren thing.

It was, but not because of the cancer ..... Because he never made honor roll again! LOL. I have lived long enough to see him graduate from high school, serve in the navy, get married, and have his first child with the second on the way. I still cry at special events and milestones ... I think because I appreciate each one so much and am so happy to be witnessing each one. Cancer does terrible things to all of us but it does give us a greater joy at life's special times.

I bought a wig in a style I'd always loved but couldn't wear b/c of my natural curly hair. I got lots of compliments and will probably still wear it on a bad hair day! I mostly wore baseball style hats, though, and had one to match just about every outfit. My school had a tea for me when I retired and everyone gave me a hat. It was cool!",
