NO RISK FACTORS...age 52...no family history of BC...large families with longevity...breastfed babes at 21 & 23, late period at 15, early menopause/ovarian failure/zero estrogen at 36... But recent diagnosis of ADH and IDC (microcalcs on screening mammo)....SURPRISE!!!... WHAT????... 5 yr. risk of only 0.9% compared to ave. of 1.4%....that means 99.1% chance of not getting BC... Anxiety/depression issues for years, major anxiety over this, BUT...found the more I read & the more knowledge I acquired, the less anxious I have become about all this...not sure if that helps any of you, but it sure settled me down.  Don't fear the statistics....just as I was so unlikely to get BC....any of us could just as easily have the good fortune of being on the \"good\" side of the statistics too!!! ",
