My dr says we will wait for the results of the u/s and go from there. I know that the u/s is just the beginning and will need a biopsy. I keep thinking it is going to be weeks before I find out what it is. Breast Cancer is so unbelievably prevelant in my family. Almost every woman on my mother's side has had BC at least once. My cousin was diagnosed at my age (27)... The waiting is driving me crazy so I understand what you are feeling.",

I just moved to a new city to escape a 4 year abusive relationship. I have no job and my insurance is about to lapse. I am frantaically looking for work with benefits... I was referred to a doctor from a friend and met with her last week. I am scheduled for an u/s Thursday - not that the u/s is going to tell me what it is... I too have a very strong history of BC... My cousin was diagnosed at my age as well. I am freaking out and feel completely alone! I am finding that reading posts and stories is helping, but I can't get out of my head. Everything is going through my mind... I keep thinking that I have lost 30lbs in less that 3 months - originally thought it was due to stress and now I am wondering if it is connected to the lump... Roller Coaster Ride doesn't even begin to explain my feelings.",
