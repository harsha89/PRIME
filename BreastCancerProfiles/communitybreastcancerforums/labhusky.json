Sorry, my head is spinning, and I worry a lot.  I probably will have to take a pill but I can handle that.  But how long, like 5 years again but not tamoxifen because the surgeon I would get something like aroma based (sorry I know thats not the right spelling).  Are they any good?

Hang in their Purple, you are just like the rest of us believe me!!!",
