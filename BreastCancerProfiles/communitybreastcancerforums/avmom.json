Like hugz, she says that the water acts as compression, so no garments are necessary. I'm off for vacation next to a lake at the end of this week, and am hoping the water is wam enough to swim every day. Best to everyone",

As I recall, it was at least three months after my last treatment before I had even a shadow of fuzz on my head, which sounds much the same as you. By six months post chemo, i had what looked like a cheap buzz cut, and occasionally went out with that \u201clook\u201d. I wore headcovers and scarves, mostly. I wore a wig for about a year, if I wanted to present myself \u201cwith hair\u201d to the outside world. Others have their hair grow back much more quickly. I\u2019m three years out from diagnosis now, and have a short haircut. My hair came back in a \u201cpatchy\u201d way, and I still have some thin spots that show if I grow my hair longer than a pretty short style. There are still days that I wear a wig, if it is very cold. My hair isn\u2019t really enough to keep my head warm, and it is soft and easily disturbed if I wear a warm hat, and having smashed down hair isn\u2019t suitable for my job. If I am wearing a \u201chair hat\u201d (wig),no one expects me to take it off, and frankly, the sensation of having shoulder length hair just feels right some days. I didn\u2019t wear wigs much in the summer, but I do live in a cold climate, so that was a never a huge factor for me. I had no/sparse eyebrows for a long time, and I\u2019m pretty good at filling them in with cosmetics. I never had thick eyebrows, so I think that\u2019s pretty normal. My eyelashes did grow back, but slowly. It could take a while, but it sounds like you are on the way. Best wishes and gentle hugs as your rads start",

      "Content": "Aug 13, 2015 10:24AM - edited Aug 13, 2015 10:25AM by avmom Hi Tamkay, I finished 4x dose dense taxol in mid June, after 4x dose dense AC. I had a lot of gastrointestinal side effects from the AC, so I'm glad you had relatively few SEs. Overall, I found that the Taxol was easier than the AC. I continued to have fatigue, which increased with each round, and my tummy was still not very good, but it was much better, as I was nauseated for the entire time that I was doing AC. It was mostly acid tummy, and I controlled that with OTC Zantac. That has resolved completely now. Food didn't taste like much during Taxol treatment, but it was better than the awful taste in my mouth during AC. I did have some peripheral neuropathy from the Taxol, and although it has partially resolved, I continue to have issues, particularly with my feet. Your MO will be monitoring this closely, and sometimes your dosage will be adjusted if the neuropathy escalates My eyebrows and eyelashes continued to disappear throughout Taxol treatment, and for a few weeks afterward, but my eyebrows are coming back pretty well. My eyelashes are a bit behind. I started to grow hair on my head about 7 weeks pfc, and now I have about a quarter inch of hair. Here's a pic I took last week:  I'm not much of a picture taker, but you can see that there's a bit of fuzz growing back. Infusion days were longer for Taxol than AC - the infusion goes slowly. That said, the Benadryl that you get made me pretty sleepy, so it didn't seem so long, as I usually had a nap during the infusion. I had Neulasta the day after each infusion, and although my blood counts dipped some, I never needed a transfusion. I hope that sharing this gives you some comfort in starting your Taxol treatments. As reactions to chemo are so individual, your mileage may vary, but it is doable. Best wishes to you. You can do this!",

Right after diagnosis is just about the hardest time - so much uncertainty, so little to hang on to, just the knowledge that things are going to be different. Once you have met with your surgeon and oncologist, and have a treatment plan, the path forward seems to be easier to navigate. Treatment is available, and is effective for many, many people. I found the time between diagnosis and the start of treatment excruciating. It seemed that I would never sleep again (spoiler alert, I did sleep again and during treatment I slept a LOT). Just knowing there is a plan was very reassuring. People would ask me how I was, and for a while, all I could answer was, I breathe in, I breathe out. About a year after my diagnosis, a friend was diagnosed with stage II estrogen positive BC. \"Breathe in, breathe out\" became a bit of a mantra and a running joke between us. Sometimes we would just text each other with the initials, BIBO. She went through treatment with flying Colors, and is doing well,as have many others. I am happy to lend you some confidence that you will, too. BIBO",
