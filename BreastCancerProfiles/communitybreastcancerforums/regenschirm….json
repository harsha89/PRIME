But we are having on going discussions about ddoing tissue expander first and finishing step later. Some of this will be determined by my MRI in two weeks.

I couldn't sleep at all for the first couple of weeks. I listened to music took walks. Once I had a game plan, I entered warrior mode. My story is similar to yours. I have three young boys. Found a lump in a self exam. In my case I have multifocal disease. I just finished the last round of chemo and have a surgery date scheduled. A friend of mine pointed out two positives (won't say good because it isn't it just all around sucks) to doing chemo first: you will see that your cancer responds to the meds and if there has been spread you are hitting it hard up front. In my case we are hoping for a better surgical outcome by doing chemo first. You absolutely can do this. Baby steps still move you closer to putting all of this in the rearview. Just remember to breathe.",

PLan to have ovaries out at the same time. Premise for this is that we don't know how much of the cancer is dcis vs invasive multicentric disease. Most important thing is to fight the cancer.

Got my post chemo MRI results yesterday and was disappointed that the effect wasn't more dramatic. Doc says we won't really know what is going on with me until the surgical path comes in. So hard to wait and be calm with uncertainty. We don't know how much of my \"non mass like enhancement\" is invasive and how much dcis. Overall dimension went from 5x6 to 4 x5 approximately. Also overall signal intensity went down. So now I wait and try to do things to be healthy and recover from chemo.",
