I am trying to relax while also thinking of what questions I want to ask doctor tomorrow at the same time & it all feels like too much. I keep jumping ahead so far in the future & trying to remind myself I don't know much to do anythingwith right now.",

      "Content": "skv0123 wrote: Good morning. I'm feeling really anxious this morning due having a biopsy & getting results tomorrow. The radiologist said he saw a 17x11x15 mm lesion after a call back, ultrasound etc.,in right breast at 9 o'clock. I feel guilty as a felt a lump about 3-4 months ago. But, I have fibroids & dense breast.My dr felt it & \u201cwasn't concerned\" due to it moving, being tender & I had just stopped HRT that I took for 1 year. But, she did emphasize not to skip my mammo & to go as scheduled which I did, but I'm beating myself up that I should have done something sooner, shouldn't have tried HRT for a year. It was extremely helpful but i stopped 8 mths ago due to cancer risk & here I am. I meet with breast surgeon tomorrow to get results & talk plan. I can't decide if I want to get a second opinion about plan but guess I need a first opinion first :) & feel overwhelmed. I'm sad and scared. I have 2 teens & don't want to tell them. A good friend was recently diagnosed. Thanks for listening. SKV Log in to post a reply",

I do not want to wast emotional energy on that BS (not breast surgeon :) Met surgeon today. Path tests were not back. She told me based on ultrasound pics she would recommend removal with lumpectomy no matter path results. Lump was 11mmx17x15. She told me path results will be back by end of week & if positive (as she suspects) she recommend genetic testing which will take approximately 4 days due to history of colon & some prostate cancer in my family. if any genetic testing comes back positive for breast cancer it may influences my decision of lumpectomy (with radiation) vs.mastectomy We are supposed to travel to Portugal in 10 days for 10 'days. BS said \"go & have fun. Let's get all test results in, explore your options & we'll plan surgery end of June or early July.\" She offered small doses of estrogen blocker to ease my anxiety if path comes back estrogen positive & discussed compression socks etc. the majority of me agrees & knows 10 days of travel won't make a huge difference & I can't make informed decisions for about 10-14 days anyway. But, the other part says stay home, plan surgery, investigate, prepare, Thanks for listening & feedback.",
