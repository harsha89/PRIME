I used to be extremely healthy, but within six weeks from my DX, I have learned the hard facts about my cancer, that is HER+. I also noticed that although the chemo did not make me terribly sick, there are small uncomfortable side effects. I cannot imagine having it again after my present treatment is over (5 more times, 15 more weeks to go). I have not started my radiation yet. I heard that it can damage my heart. I wonder if I should consider mastectomy. Here are my questions: 1) Will my BC return after mastectomy? How can it return if I don't even have a breast? 2) Do I still need radiation if I had mastectomy? 3) The pro and cons about reconstruction. 4) The cost of reconstruction if it is not covered by insurance 5) The effectiveness of reconstruction. My bra size is 34-B or 34-B. My breasts are small but very noticeable on my athletic XS body (I am under 5 ft tall, and weigh 106). Will my reconstructed breasts look as nice as Angelina Jolie's. I know I sound silly and vain. But this is a valid question. Does it take $$$$ to get her breasts? Or most plastic surgeon can do it? I admit vanity is one of my worst vices. However, at the age of 67, it's a bit hard to change my character. Yes. Sometimes I say to myself, as an old woman, why does it matter to look nice? On the other hand, it's sad to lose my figure, which is still attractive even today (my lumpectomy is not very noticeable.) I think cancer patients or older ladies should still be interested in their looks.
