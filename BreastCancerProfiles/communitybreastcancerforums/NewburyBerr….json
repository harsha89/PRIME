It is very firm and tender at this point from all the poking and prodding. I'd had a mammogram in March 2014 which the results were dense breasts but normal (including my silicone implants).  Once I felt this lump I called and had my MD's office feel it. They immediately ordered an ultrasound which I had yesterday.  The woman doing is was a breast cancer survivor herself. She could NOT find the lump on the ultrasound and called the radiologist in who also could not find the lump.  Both could distinctively feel it but when they applied the little wand nothing was showing up. I am now going to research the breast center at Lahey Clinic in Burlington, MA for an appointment to be seen and determine what my next steps are. I'm hoping they can do an MRI to rule out cancer. I lost my younger sister 7 years ago to cancer. It wasn't breast cancer but I know how they can \"miss\" things in the medical world and I don't intend to allow that to happen.  I am happy to have found this forum.   Any tips from the greater group are appreciated.    I'm 43 years old.  Have 2 kids.  Had Mentor Implants 2 years ago and a revision 1 year ago to sew stitches for more of an internal bra.  Had blood work done in March and CBC was totally normal. Everything was normal bloodwise. Thanks!",
