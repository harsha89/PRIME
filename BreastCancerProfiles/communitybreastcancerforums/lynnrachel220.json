I was so scared to find a lump almost on my nipple that felt like a frozen pea. It is hard and appears to be movable. My mother assured me that its fine and I shouldn't see a doctor. However, I felt that something just wasn't right. So, months later, I made an appointment with my Gynocologist to check it out. She wasn't too concerned but ordered a sonogram just to be sure. The doctor who did the sonogram said to not worry but wanted to do a biopsy just to make sure it is not cancerous. Today, I got the biopsy and the doctor said that she thought that the lump was hard. I'm just so scared that it could be cancer! Log in to post a reply",
