I\u2019ve noticed about 6 months ago, my breasts look like they have open pores... (kind of like when it\u2019s hot outside and your pores on your face seem enlarged) these \u201cpores\u201d seem to be worse on my under boob, I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s normal; as I do have large breasts. I also have this red rash under my breast (like bursted blood vessels) munch breast do not hurt. I do have children and have breast fed for short period of times before. I am truly just concerned and have schedule an appointment for the end of january. FOr anyone who has been diagnosed with IBC, what were your earliest signs/symptoms?
