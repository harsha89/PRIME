It sidelines me, and since beginning mammography and learning I'm high risk (frequent surveillance), its really affected me. No fun. Thank you MTWoman for the info and wisdom. I'll also add that breast screening and elevated breast cancer risk both typically start in our 40s....which is also when we often start into perimenopause and all the fun hormonal swings. Anxiety is a huge symptom of perimenopause, even for women who have never had anxiety before. So it can really be a double whammy. Awareness does help. For me, I didn't at first recognize that I was dealing with anxiety. I actually just really though that the world was ending and there was certain, impending doom around every corner. (So my first irregular mammogram call-back was a whole lot of fun...I knew it was the worst case scenario.) I still deal with anxiety....but it is at least somewhat helpful to now recognize it for what it is.",

I am almost never on this forum, but happened on today and your post happened to be on the top--and I so, so feel you! I'm 43 (mom of 5 ages 17-5) and went for my first mammo last summer and got the dreaded call back--diagnostic mammo and US followed, and they found a \"thingy\" that was inconclusive, \"probably\" not cancer, but not totally sure. Doctor said to come back in 6 months and we'll take another look. No big, right? I mean with all the push for early screening, we KNOW this happens. They find stuff. Which leads to a lot of additional testing which mostly always turns out to be nothing, and sometimes early stage cancer, which may or may not ever threaten our health...yadda, yada. Nothing to worry about, right? SO wrong. I was a freak. It was a HUGE anxiety trigger for me, and I was incapacitated. Couldn't eat, Was a crying basket case. It was embarrassing, as I could hardly function. Perhaps some perimenopausal anxiety? (Ya think?) But the reality is that breast cancer is a huge anxiety trigger for many of us because it hits us close...we jump from zero to worst-case scenario in a nanosecond and the emotions run super high, especially during our 40s/50s when we may not have the best emotional resiliency to begin with. I know that none of that likely makes it better for you, but I just want to say that what you are feeling is so common. True, some women handle the uncertainty better than others, but today, that's not you. And its OK. Don't be tempted to beat yourself up for being upset. This is time to have grace and compassion on yourself, and to give yourself a freaking break. :) Its OK to be emotional and scared, even though statistics are way, way on your side that everything is going to be just fine. All that said, in my case, my doctor (a breast surgeon and specialist) suggested a blood test for me at my 6 month followup, since the thingy was still there, no change, but still visually inconclusive. The test was called Videssa Breast by Provista and you can google it. It is a test for protein markers that are present when breast tumors are present, and it is a good \"predictive negative\" test....meaning that if its negative, its negative. But if its positive, its still likely negative, but then a biopsy may be in order to rule out cancer. In my case, the blood test was negative, and it saved me the angst of a biopsy. (Although it did require 3 weeks to receive back results.) So this could be something to mention to your doctor? Anyway...big, big hugs. Oye...I so know the anxiety and it sucks. Its going to be OK. Sending love. Shawna",

Yes, he's up on the latest, but my understanding is that the test is available not, and not part of a trial. I won't post the link, but you can Google the company's website by typing Videssa Breast. <3 ",
