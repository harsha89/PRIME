Aimee I have the same problem that you noted about anxiety, I'm not normally an anxious person but as I breath I can see my chest heaving in the glass and metal of the machine so I breath quicker.  THEN, I think I'm twitching and moving during the treatments, the techs have sworn to me that I'm not moving.  I've elected not to take drugs so that I can drive myself to treatment but told my RO about the anxiety and she recommended that the techs talk to me via speaker during my 4 \"shots\"; this has helped greatly. The chemo was difficult with the various side effects but the actual infusions didn't bother me at all.  My last chemo was March 1st and I'm finding that the runny nose, weight gain from steroids and twitching eyes have finally subsided--chemo brain is still heavily evident LOL. Radiation fatigue is nothing for me compared to the chemo fatigue.  The radiation fatigue seems to hit every couple of days and is not a constant. So far my skin is doing OK, the only problem is that I have a dry spot on my back that is hard to reach.  My treatments are at 1:00 so I shower in the morning, do not put on any cream or deodorant until after treatments.  Fortunately I don't have an odor problem despite the hot flashes.  RO said the skin issues is not dependent on how you react to a natural sunburn; it's a factor of the creams, deodorants, soaps and if you're prone to allergic reactions. I hope everyone does well with treatments and planning!",
