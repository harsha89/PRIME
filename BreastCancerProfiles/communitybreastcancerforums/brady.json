Now that I've found out that the aromotase inhibitor (that is a 5-10 yr followup to chemo and radiation) also has the effect of hair loss. So right when I was rejoining my feminine life - boom - more rockerchick looks in my future. Thanks for allowing a place to also curse the treatments. I feel (based on good evidence) that if we can just survive 3 more years, that technologies will change everything and the current approaches will be classified along with stirring the brain with a stick to cure migrains. Best of luck to you. Sometimes a healthy anger is better than a sickly surrender. :)",
