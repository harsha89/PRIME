Finished radiation the middle of February and in August the suroma felt like a golf ball in my breast. Had surgery to remove it and scar tissue from radiation. Had a drain at that time for two weeks. Healed fine, and felt much better, when six weeks later after my shower, I sprung a leak. Was put on antibiotics for ten days. Now here it is almost ten weeks later and Still draining. Only now it stinks! Back on antibiotics! Was told that the radiation has compromised the healing process in my breast. I see the surgeon again tomorrow. I pray he has a solution to this. I pray for all of you to find a solution to yr pain. Hang in there. Thanks for all your input. Nice to know this isn\u2019t so uncommon. And that we\u2019re not alone.  ",
