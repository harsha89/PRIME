I had a tissue expander placed & had 2 drains. One drain was removed 1 week post op. I thought the second drain woul come out week 2 but no such luck. I was pretty bummed about it but am taking it all in stride. My pathology reports came back clear with no invasion & my nodes/margins were clean/clear. Hopefully, the remaining drain will come out at the next visit & expansion will begin. I'm grateful but am emotionally all over the place! Argh.........not sure what's wrong with me or what to feel. The tissue expander feels odd & at times painful but I really can't complain. This has been an interesting journey thus far & I'm just getting started. Thanks for reading",
