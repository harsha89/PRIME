I am a 38 year old single woman - never married, never been pregnant,  history of cancer in my family (both parents), on birth control since age 18 for very bad periods, for about 10 years after which I just stopped using them.  Anyhow, about a month ago I had to see gynae for annual check-up.  Asked him if I should go for a mammogram or ultrasound (breast pains for the past 6 months at about period time) - he said \"No...no need to\" 2 weeks after that visit, I went to my GP for some painkillers, as the breast pains (left breast, outer quadrant) were killing me (so to speak).  He asked me if I do the BE's and of course, I don't. Uhm, yeah, very stupid I know now!   He did, and found 3 lumps in my left breast - probably benign he said (he's my younger sis' GP too and she has a history of fybromalgia.  Already had 1 very large cyst surgically removed.  For my breast pains etc : Most probably mastalgia he says...Anyhow, he booked an Ultrasound for me.  The radiologist's office said they can do both mammo and U/S considering my family-and personal history.  Mammogram showed nothing, except some minor calcification.  Technician then did U/S.  After what seemed like forever prodding and pressing, she called the Radiologist.  He did the same - more prodding and pressing...Anyhow, this was the diagnosis : R/B 3 lumps, 1 x 6.1mm small oval-shaped benign appearing lesion in the 10 o clock position of the right breast, probably fibroadenoma - (Hey, there's nothing wrong with my right breast!  I don't have any pain there!)  Anyhow, this is the comment they wrote to my GP.  \"Short-term follow-up U/S within 6 months recommended to confirm stability of the lesion to be repeated every 6 months thereafter.  Annual mammogrphy also recommended. Routine follow-up is recommended with these films available (they gave me and GP copies) for comparison.  Please note that any clinically palpable mass should be managed by its own merits despite the above findings.\" My GP said nothing to worry about, but I really should go for the U/S every 6 months and examine my own breasts every month.  But he does NOT recommend a mammogram again - he does not \"believe\" in them. (EDIT to read : \"does not believe in annual mammograms)  Now, why am I feeling \"stupid\"? - Because it seems like no-one is taking my concerns seriously!  I mean, I know that these \"lesions\" are probably benign, but it's SCARY.  I keep looking (probably shouldn't) at the U/S picture the radiologist printed for me (indicating 3 larger lumps and the one small one he mentions and marked off) - it looks different than the other 2...and it SCARES me!  The Radiologist took my hand and smiled and said to me : \"Nothing to worry about Miss, but talk to your doctor - see you\".  My GP says: \"We'll monitor it closely, but nothing to worry about\"  Uhm...yeah!  I worry!  What am I supposed to do for the next \"couple of months\"...I am a PA and events co-ordinator and planner - I have lots to keep me busy during the day...but alone at night, lying with my arm folded under me and feeling the little pea-sized thingamyjigger isn't easy...  I have been reading some posts and comments on this site for a couple of days before I decided to join.  I know there are a lot of compassionate and knowledgable people here.  Please tell me they (my GP and radiologist) are right and I have nothing to worry about.
