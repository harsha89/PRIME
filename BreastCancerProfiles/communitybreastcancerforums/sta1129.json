There was a slight change in my nipple at the end of rads, but at that point I assume it was part of all the other stuff going on. All of that stuff has or is healing - the change is still there. It's like a quarter of my nipple is a zit - slightly swollen, slightly different texture and color. Anyone else have this?

Amber, I also have some dark hair follicles, so I'll ask about that as well. I started noticing them at the end of radiation, and asked someone on my way out the door. They said it was normal and would go away. Some have, some haven't. I hadn't thought about the dye. Since you're a nurse, let me brag about my nurse and the SNB dye. It was her first day back after breast cancer treatment, and I went in really anxious about the pain of the nipple shots. I had been with a friend when she had her shots, and I could not believe the pain she had. My nurse came in first thing and told me about her experience (also painful) and said it was because the radiation people insisted on putting on the numbing stuff and then didn't give it the full hour to take affect. She pulled out the cream and said that if I was with her we would put it on right then and see if being fully numbed when I went up decreased the pain. She was a genius. I have gone back and thanked her, and passed on the advice to others when they tell me they are going in for surgery. I refer to her as a saint. ",
