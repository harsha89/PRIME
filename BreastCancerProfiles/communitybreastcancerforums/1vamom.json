Lungs have been the worst, as I am tied to an oxygen line I can't escape. I luckily have lots of \"family support,\" but am still at a total loss as to where to start thinking this thru. And actually feel completely alone, and like I would do my family the biggest favor by just getting \"out of their way\" quickly. I have been in chemo since January, with most of an idea about the \"plan,\" but still feel completely out of control of EVERYTHING. I don't have much faith in counseling, am a pretty private soul, and have met before the one counselor I believe is provided by my insurance co, and really wasn't impressed. I am in such a fog, am completely energy-free and lethargic, and end up wondering why I am not \"doing better\" at this, for lack of a better term. Also, feeling awful for feeling so awful, as my conditions could be a million times worse than I feel like they actually are, when I take the true measure of it all. Such a back and forth, and up and down from day-to-day. Then figure that is to be expected, and the cycle starts anew. I really just can't seem to get much of a grip on any of it, or how I feel about any of it, or how I should feel, or anything else... Recent chemo (Gemzar) seems to be doing it's job, and I think it's driving me nuts just sitting around from week to week waiting, or whatever it is I am doing. Thanks for listening, I don't really have anyone who just wants to listen to me cry. Reading back, all I think is geez what a whiner, and try to tell myself that's o.k. I have a great cat who's totally freaked out by it all...",

I spent several years(!) not wanting to waste anyone's time with what I thought was an infected milk duct.  Turns out I have cancer, and now am facing chemo to try and shrink this lump before they operate, which I probably wouldn't have had to do before.  Not trying to scare you into anything, and best of luck tomorrow, but please don't feel like you are wasting anyone's time with anything that concerns you.  Again, best of luck tomorrow, and every woman here hopes you are just wasting time and that this will turn out to be nothing.",

I would never dream of offering medical advice, as I am not a doctor. But to think that my good wishes would not only be ignored, but they would offend someone? Why are my thoughts,fears, and good wishes not respected because I have not been at this as long? Aren't those who have gone before us those we are here to learn from? Barbe had it right with sand box mentality.  I feel like I'm in high school and at the wrong lunch table.  Sorry to any I've offended in my quest for knowledge about this disease we share, and I'll sign off 'til I know my place.",

And shouldn't look to any of you \"Stagers\" for information? I don't see a category for \"Had a really crappy miscarriage at the start of all this, now can't start Chemo till my blood levels are better, and can't have any surgery until Chemo is done, but still freaked out, and looking for information i could possibly use later\" I think this is incredibly selfish, not to realize that if you post here, someone is going to come along looking for info and may possibly peek into someone else's threads. But, that said, I absolutely respect anyone's need to privacy and respect. So, if I am seeking knowledge, I will stick to basic threads, and not worry about, or comment on, anyone's cancer that is \"worse\" than mine. ",
