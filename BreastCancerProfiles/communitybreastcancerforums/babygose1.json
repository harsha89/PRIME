She has several variations of prosthetics that she wears, and says they aren't comfortable. \"Heavy, unwashable, they hurt her scars, don't look real, etc.\" I was wondering if other people who've had mastectomies experience the same things, and what would you do to make it better if you made them? I am an art student and want to surprise her with a pair that I made myself. Any advice or input would be greatly appreciated! Stay strong! Log in to post a reply",
