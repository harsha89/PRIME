I am not aware of any CDK 4/6 drug that is approved or fast track for Her2 Positive patient. There are three (palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) CDK 4/6 drugs that are approved for Her2Negative. There are two positive abstracts about using themfor Her2-Positive, so I am planning to talk to her Onc about off label use. PI3K mutation implies sensitive to Affinitor (Everolimus), but that didn't seem to work for her. I am hoping SYD-985, Margetuximab, and particularly DS-8201 will be approved soon. But right now, the worry is why her count continues to go down a month after radiation. Thank you all for reading. Nguyen",
