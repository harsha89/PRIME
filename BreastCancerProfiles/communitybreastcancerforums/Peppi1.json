It's my understanding that after a certain age, a fibroadenoma that is growing is usually removed. As you age, it should get smaller if anything. So the fact that it's getting larger is just a little red flag. I apologize, but I can't recall now after which age it should shrink and not grow. The size of mine is monitored. Plus if it's growing,  I think it can block the view on imaging of a potential cancer...so it will help future imaging tests if it's out. Wishing you all the best.",

There are also clinics for those at high risk for breast cancer where patients with no cancer diagnosis are seen by oncologists. I have seen some other posts by you on that come across as though you are irritated or as if you are making a point to be disagreeable. If you don't think having ADH or ALH or being high risk for breast cancer is a big deal...it seems odd that you would continue to read these threads.",

I was not given the option to just monitor the lump. It had to be removed to make sure nothing more serious was in there..but I am also told that most of the time they do not find cancer. I keep telling myself that part! I also have a very strong family history of breast cancer, so that raises the odds for me.  Wow..that sounds quick for a lump to grow..is there any chance it's swelling from your previous biopsy or something?? I hope it turns out to be something like that. You look very young in your photo..I hope they take it out and you get a clean slate and can forget about all this!! It is nervewracking..isn't it??",

So the Dr. the receptionist put you through to was the radiologist or your Obgyn? You may consider calling your Obgyn and letting her/him know what your thoughts are since that is the person that ordered the tests. It's always good to follow through if you feel uncomfortable. You don't want to walk away with a question mark. At the very least someone needs to explain to you what exactly was seen on the mammo..what it means ect..Sounds like no one really has done that yet (?)....It's so important to have a radiology facility that you have confidence in ..and once you find it..stick with them for each screening or whatever else you have done...let us know what happens...",

You are certain, right??? It think if you go to the Breast Center to get their opinion you can accomplish 2 things. One..hear an expert tell you all is well to further ease your mind..and two, you can follow up there if there should be any issues down the road that need to be checked out. They will have your past records. The important thing is that you trust your Dr. First time around it can be hard to do that. I use the Dr.'s my family members have used..so I have much faith in them..I have seen them in action, I know they are good. I trust them.
