Today is the first day I have felt decent. Side Effects - nausea (thanks for the zofran); metallic taste in mouth; headache (felt like my head was going to explode); insomnia ( last night first night I really slept as they prescribed ambien for me yesterday); strange food tastes (like being pregnant); skin, lips,Â and hair very dry; lost 7 pounds which I did not need to lose. They say the symptoms can be different each time.Anyone know? 2nd treatment on 22 Dec",
