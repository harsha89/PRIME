My DH has to try to guess what the heck I'm talking about because things come out jumbled or I can't remember what I was going to say. Eyesight downhill too in the 4 months since I started chemo. I thought brain mets but had brain MRI found nothing. Doc says most likely side effects since only 43. Sorry your going through this. I have been a waitress forever I don't think I would remember what table to bring the food too now. No tips for me!!!",
