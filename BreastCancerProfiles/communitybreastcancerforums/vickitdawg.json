Today after they finished the test they said everything is ok. I for one do not believe them for the simple reason I have no insurance. So on my way home I stopped by my gyn and she looked at my breast and said this is swollen and warm along with the pus. She called the hospital and they said that it must have been a fold in the breast I say bull crap........So my doctor thinks it a breast infection caused. So she wants to doctor it for 14 days after that I am going to see a Breast Specialists. I think they saw no insurance and said everything is fine. I sooooo angry",

The Tech's say it a problem with the machine, same machine that took the picture of the left with no problem. Should I be worried or is this just a tech problem? Also since I am a 44 yr old women that has no children could this cause problems. This is the first mammogram I have had and I am really confused... Log in to post a reply",
