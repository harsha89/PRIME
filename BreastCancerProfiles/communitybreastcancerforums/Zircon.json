Over eight months and I still had it. Recently I had a flu and eight days later my breast was red,hot,and seroma very swollen. My bs started me on antibiotic and so far I have had two needle aspirations. Changed antibiotic as well due to bacteria/staph infection. I am moving in the right direction ,but still have a noticeable abscess/seroma which has not gone away. Wondering if this should be lanced or have third needle aspiration. Getting discouraged and now I\u2019m told to see an infectious disease doctor. How did your seroma clear up. Thank",
