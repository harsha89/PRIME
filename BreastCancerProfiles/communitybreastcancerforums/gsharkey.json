I find it very helpful to read others going through the same thing. I am having a lot of hip pain since starting on exesmatame but not sure it's the med or the mets since I have mets in my pelvis. I know that I have read a lot of people's forum that have hip and knee pain. I try to stay positive but we are all scared of the unknown. I would love to hear from other women going through the same thing.",
