    "Content": "FairyDogMother wrote: I had an oncotype dx conducted and the results came back with a high score in the low reoccurrence range, which means I won\u2019t benefit from chemotherapy. Given my age, family history, and Ki-67 of my tumor another oncologist ran a mammaprint test. The mammaprint results showed a need for chemotherapy. Has anyone else had these two test done and come back with conflicting results? Which test is better for someone under the age of 40?
