For me, there has been an upside to this experience (in addition to you guys) in that I was kind of in the doldrums with my life.  Somehow this horrible experience has kick-started me out of that.  I feel, right now any way, that by God, I'm going to live!  Do what I love most - while I can - right now.  I don't know if I have a couple of good years left or 20 - who really knows?  It has also given me an awareness that initially made me intolerant of trivial issues that now makes me notice the trivial issues, but smile right past them in a knowing way.  Like cutting through fluff and concentrating on what matters when I can. I'm sure this feeling will come and go.  Some weeks feeling emotionally stong about it, and others just downright scared.  Anyone else wake up around 4am alone with your thoughts?  Now that's a scary time of night :). Usually started with a mild hot flash <g>. Anyway, it is nice to know we are not alone on this physical and emotional rollercoaster.  I'm so thankful for all of you and that we have each other.  PS:  The Donny and Marie concert sounds great - I had a crush on him too!!",

It all feels so surreal.  To know that I'm facing this AGAIN and its more scary this time since it is IDC.  I have an MRI scheduled for 2/7, pre-op on 2/10, surgery on 2/18.  He said to expect a call back after the MRI for more biopsies.  That they often return false positives, but that if there is anything else suspicisous, they might as well get it out.  Do you guys have any thoughts on mastectomy vs. lumpectomy?    Looking forward to trying to put this out of my mind until Monday... not sure I can.  Trish",

I had mistakenly thought that with DCIS I had all the time in the world - only to find out here at the end that they say you should start 6-8 weeks from surgery.  Shorter if you have IDC etc.  I'm trying not to second guess myself for the rest of forever.  The way the rad/onc explained it to me was that the statistics they provide us are based on women (at least for DCIS) that started treatment within 8 weeks of surgery.  He said some patients suffer complications or infections from their surgery and have to wait longer.

Deb, glad you found us.  This is an incredible support system. Julie - sorry to hear about your friend.  So glad you met her though.  Interesting how some people can make an impact on us even if you just know them for a short while. Sorry to hear so many of you with skin problems - that's the worst part.  Sorry you are still struggling with it. Claire thanks for your post, I enjoy hearing from someone who has pushed on through like you have and with big time physical events.  I have a horse and hope to compete locally before the end of the year as a goal.  I kept riding through treatments as best I could - even in the heat and humidity. My own personal experience the last half of this week has been a return of the fatigue. It has to be the rads (last one was 8/11) - nothing else makes sense.  Had been doing great - felt normal and whammo.  Trying to ignore it and push on througth.  I just want to know that i'm not psyching myself out - that it is not in my head.   So if anyone out there still feels really tired after they finished, chime in! That, and I found out I had a basal cell cancer on my forehead!  2010 I guess is my year for cancer.  I know it is not serious per se, but my heart skipped a beat when the doctor personally called on Friday to tell me... you know how that goes!  (gulp)  I have a nice 1.5 inch scar on the middle of my forehead.  It will fade to a thin white line in 6 months.  ..sigh.... minor compared to the rest of this year! Off my whiny soapbox now...  Happy Labor Day Everyone! Trish",

Spendy - I'm a bad eater too - I need to work on that and more exercise.  I thought the tattoo idea was a hoot!  What will you get? Karenlen and Spendy, nice to you know feel the same way about wondering what this has truly done to us.  Its like no one will give you a truly straight answer on it.  Online either. Kim - sorry you are feeling the fatigue now.  Mine is better, but still up and down.  I almost have euphoric days and then a slow day or two - but its getting better overall for sure.  Plus I am trying to ignore it.  But it is just like you said, you know you don't have your usual stamina.  Some evenings, I just hit a wall, know I'm done for the day and go to bed.  Thanks also for the comment about skin cancer.  I think you are right.  When I went for a second opinion at Duke, they mentioned it.  One of my sisters had both BC and melanoma (caught early) so I'm seriously on the lookout.

There is another person who did a wonderful post here on what her excisional biopsy procedure was like.  Definitely find it and read it.  She was right on.  I promise you it is not bad at all. ",

What seems good about your situation is that they are moving you through the process quickly.  I had to wait what seemed like weeks in between steps.  At one point, I had to wait a month before my excisional biopsy (performed this past Friday).  It was during that month's time that somehow I came to better grips with it all (at least so far), but the first 6 weeks was a huge huge roller coaster ride.  From what I have learned, 25% of ADH cases might turn out to be DCIS.  DCIS has like a 98% cure rate with lumpectomy and radiation.  11% can turn out to have IDC.  Even if we are lucky and only have ADH, they will monitor us closely every 6 months, and look at family history and other factors to determine risk.  They might suggest we take tamoxifen, etc.  All things we wish we didn't have to think about!  But here we find ourselves... I have found these boards to be extremely helpful. Just hearing what others have to share that have also gone through this is invaluable.  You don't feel so alone.  That and once I met with the surgeon, who is also an oncologist, at least I knew what the plan was. He took alot of time to answer all my questions.  I hope you will have a similar experience and like your surgeon. Hang in there....Keep us posted on how things go. ",
