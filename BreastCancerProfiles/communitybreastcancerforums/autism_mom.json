So this is not to denigrate your cousin but if she doesnt do breast regularly its possible she missed something.

Now this is the part where I really get lost because there are positive and negative numbers but basically less than 1.5 is normal, 1.5 to 2.5 is osteopenia and you just have \"thinned\" bones, and greater than 2.5 is osteoporosis where you have \"porous\" bones.  So I guess osteoporosis is bones like swiss cheese, and osteopenia your bones are melting.  Not literally, but thats how I explained it to my dh...lol.  So I've got melting bones but according to my fav. IM doctor it would be \"very unsual\" for a spontaneous fracture to occur with just osteopenia.  Here's to hoping I'm very unsual!",

Anyways, I went to the dr. and got an order for dx mammo and ultrasound, plus a rib xray.  I had those done on Tuesday and got results for xray back today but not mammo and ultrasound.  Said I have a corticle rib fracture.  Okay...I had absolutely no trauma.  Did nothing to injure myself.  Didn't have any bouts of coughing or vomiting. So now I'm just a bit freaked out.  Does this sound like BC with mets to my ribs???? And here's the problem.  I am GOING to go to a breast specialist regardless of the mammo and ultrasound results, but have a vacation planned with my 3 kids and hubby next week.  How long can I wait to have a dx and start treatment?  I doubt a week will make much difference, but just thought I should check with some people who have been there...done that.

Anybody know about rapidness of bone mets?",

And I didnt even go to the Houston facility. Finally had my appt. today. I loved the dr. I saw. She ws not too happy with how my right breast looks. It is not swollen but there is a bright pink rash on th top and outside of it that actually showed up yesterday. There is also bruising (not self inflicted from poking and pushing. I showed them the two self inflicted bruiss in the axillary area..lol). She said she doesnt really think Ibc because there is no thickening but brought up ibc several times without prompting. I decided my strategy was going to go in and let them look and give an opinion before I brought up any of my theories. So she did a skin punch biopsy (which my kids think is super cool and my dd is hoping to get the sample back so she can keep it in a jar) and said if it doesnt show anything she would provably do an mri if my symptoms are persisting by next appt. She also sent me straight to the imaging center for a repeat mammo and ultrsound which of course still dont show anything. She also has me set up with one of their internal med drs tomorrow after my dexa scan to address the spontaneous rib fractures. So all in all a pretty productive visit. I feel like I am finally in competent hands and they will keep working to uncover the problem. She did talk about trying antibiotics if all else fails but doesnt believe that it is an infection. The only bad thing is that the strange breast texture (dimply..wrinkly..I dont even know how to describe it) was on hiatus for the appt. I may have to try getting some pics to show her. Thank you all for the wonderful support so far. I promise to keep you posted.",

I seriously feel like I should make a commercial for these people.  But first things first.  I went for my DEXA scan (who knew what a simple little test that would be) and managed to weezle the report out of the tech.  Turns out that I have osteopenia at the ripe old age of 40.  Oh well, I knew I had a lot of risk factors.  Then had an appt. with my new favorite internal medicine guy.  He walks into the room about 45 seconds after I sit down (always a plus) and we start talking.  This guy already knew my whole history...including things I hadn't ever even mentioned to the.  He actually studied my case before I got there and without even looking at any notes was discussing the entire new history and a bunch of old stuff that he thought my be relevant to my current problem.  I was completely in awe.  So bottom line...he took my cd from my rib xray (which also had my previous mammo and ultrasound on it) and said he was going to go over it with the radiologist to see what they could figure out.  Meanwhile he ordered additional blood work and a bone scan to see if my ribs are the result of metastasis.  I dont know how accurate those are but he said it would show if they were due to cancer.  Hes going to talk with the bs and radiologist and said he will call me within 24 hours to let me know what our plan is.  I went and got my blood work done, and went home.  As I'm walking in the door, my phone is ringing.  My bs is calling to tell me the results of the skin punch biopsy are in.  I said, well that was fast and she told me that the pathologist called her to discuss the case when he got the sample.  It's so weird.  These people have really got their s*** together!!!  Anyways, the result is that it doesn't show \"cancer\" but it does show inflammation so she is going to get a breast MRI.  I didn't have to ask or beg for any of this stuff...all the stuff I wanted done.  So I still don't know anything really, but man alive am I impressed with my \"team\". ",

I took the advice of everyone on here and got an appt with a breast specialist/surgeon. I just happen to be lucky enough to live close to an md anderson cancer center wich according to all on the ibc forum and others is the top for ibc dx tx and research. But also mayo clinic and i think fox chase (i had never heard of that one). You should go to the ibc forum and post question for best centers. I dont think that forum is as active so might take a bit to get a response. If ibc is what it is a month is too long to wait. I didnt need a referral either. They had a special clinic for undiagnosed people. Probably the other centers have that kind of thing too. Just wanted me to bring whatever films I had. And just to note...most of the posts are from people like us who have ibc symptoms but who didnt end up having it. I think Ive only seen maybe one who ended up having that dx. Also...it can happen but it is exceedingly rare for ibc to be bilateral. Dont know if that helps with you worry...it certainly hasnt for me . . lol",

First, before I left i saw my PCP who ordered a DEXA scan, did some basic blood work including a SED rate (forgot to ask for the thyroid dang it!) and referred me to a breast surgeon.  Well, I made the appts. but the bs couldn't see me until Aug 3rd which I thought was a little far off (she is out of town).  But MD Anderson called me back and I have an appt with the Suspicion of BC clinic?? on Monday the 23rd.  DEXA scan is the 24th and haven't heard back about my blood work yet.  While I was gone, my right breast started to get what I am guessing to be the peau d'orange look to it.  There are still alot of broken capillaries all over but no bright red rashy looking areas.  The shape is also very distorted if I look down, but not as much if I look in the mirror.  The nipple actually looks to be pointing towards my right arm.  The pain is much better unless I wear a bra, bathing suit or even a tank top with the little built in shelf thing.  So I have been going \"commando\" for a month now.  So this breast DEFINATELY does not look right but I don't know if it will be noticable to anyone but me.  Problem is...now the other breast is acting up.  The first thing I noticed was the broken capillary redness.  Then while I was in the shower I noticed a big swelling under the left arm and some \"lumps\" in the area right above the breast, close to the armpit.  Then within a day or two there were multiple bruises on the breast and lymph nodes areas but the bruises were light a pinkish, orangy-yellowish color.  And I have what I can only call a \"disappearing areola\".  The areola is literally blending into the color of the skin (where the broken capillaries are).  Okay...also, when I got my mammo films back and took a look at them, the right breast is CLEARLY much larger than the left.  This was not the case on my last mammo.  Plus, I'm no radiologist, but I swear there is skin thickening, especially in the area of the areolas. So questions: Does anyone have experience with MD Anderson Suspicion on BC clinic and what do you think? Does anyone have experience with having symptoms in both breasts (I am thinking IBC or ILC here...) Has anyone had this mysterious disappearing areola phenomenon and had it mean something? Will the DEXA scan show if there is a malilgnancy or does it just show bone thickness (have tried to research but still can't tell)  And btw, these rib fractures do not feel like they are healing.  Keep having flare ups of pain, etc. I am going out of my mind.  I feel like an idiot...like I am somehow conjuring all of these weird breast changes and the doctors are going to just laugh at me.  In a way, I am almost glad for the rib fractures because maybe it will be what makes them take me seriously.  Sorry for the long post.  I hope somebody will have some answers.  Thank you.",

Thanks again for your response.",

I dont know about the abnormal paps unless you have endo implants on your cervix. Also it is extremely rare but it is possible to have endo implant in the breast through the lymphatic system. Maybe the two (three really...considering your urinary sx) are related and maybe not. Im just really glad you are seeing a doctor on Friday. ps...PDD is a tricky one. You get to have all of the symptoms and none of the assistance for therapy. At least thats how it is in Az.",

When you have a constellation of symptoms they can all be related. Anything from hormonal abnormalities to endometriosis (I had urinary problems for years with my endo) to cancer. Now that you will have insurance I urge you to make sure your gyn follows up on ALL your symptoms. If he/she gives you the impression of being 'blown off' find a different gyn. It doesnt matter how you dealt with this in the past...only how you deal with it in the present and future. Good luck and please let us know how it goes on Friday.",
