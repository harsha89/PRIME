I did take the rest of the week off so hopefully will be ok by Monday so can go to work and at least get a game plan going with my supervisor on what we can do to make the transition go easier.  It looks like there is a hiring freeze on so no real hope for a replacement until July.  Oh well, I keep telling myself, one more to go.  LJ13 - a special thanks for the story about the apple.  It did make me laugh and not feel nearly so bad about the \"eggs\".  Did you know that they are one slimy mess to clean up?  I had the carton out to hard boil some and didn't realize that the carton was so close to the edge of the counter and as I was pulling eggs out of one side, it got unbalanced and, you guessed it, it crashed to the floor with about 4 eggs in it.  Well, I had 2 in my hand, my mouth forming the words, Oh S**t! so I figured what was half a dozen and threw the other 2 on the floor too.  Blessings for a very loving and patient dp as she was right there helping with the clean up.  My hands don't work right, no strength (try opening 3 splenda packets vs 2) and I have determined I am a WEENIE!  But I will get stronger and it is such a comfort knowing that everyone here is so supportive.  The darkness is lifting some though from the weather today, you wouldn't know it.  I am kinda enjoying the little bit of storming and thunder.  I always liked sleeping when it was raining.

Welcome Billsgirl and CathyCA.  You have found a good place for info and support. LJ13 - Sorry about the stats but there is a lot of info out there about triple negative.  And don't be scared about the statistics for that either.  There was a Mayo study that said that something like 35% of triple negative women NEVER received chemo and I'm sure that affected the numbers some.  If I can find the link, I will try to put it in here later. There is also a good article at breast cancer watch digest.  If you google it, you can get the link.  The link wouldn't work when I tried to put it in here.  Keep your head up.  I know it is easier said than done but being positive sure helps how you feel. Ok my port is in and it really wasn't bad except that my nose seemed to be a good leverage point?!?  Really though, it went well.  It is on my right side and my neck is sore and it is hard to turn my head to the left but that might be because it was in the same position for a while.  I am back home and am going to be lazy the rest of the day.  Possibility of storms this afternoon and I love to sleep during storms.",

I am feeling fine except a little foggy headed (slight headache).  Have eaten a little bit and still ok.  Going to keep taking the anti nausea at least for a couple of days? just to be sure.  If anyone knows if I should go longer, please let me know.  I have received more valuable information from the girls here than from anywhere.  Thanks to all!

I have decided that I might make a little scrapbook out of the chemo experience and will print out the pictures and funny and inspirational stories and poems to add to it.  Hope that is ok with all the authors. Glad that quite a few were able to have a decent V-Day.  My partner was sick so I was staying away from her.  Think it was a stomach bug brought on by food and stress as she is better now.  But I was not taking any chances.

Anyway, sorry to cry about it and only 2 more to go.  Trying to throw all the se's out there for anyone that will also be doing the Taxotere. I will be trying to catch up and sending some shout outs.  From what I have read so far, some are having a rough go of it, either from treatment or things in daily life.  My prayers are with them even if I don't shout out individually.  There have been so many times that I have been down and just coming here and reading something someone else wrote, has made all the difference.  Thanks to everyone.  Be back later today to post some shout outs.  In the meantime....((((HUGS))))",

Carol - As far as the port goes, I was told I have to keep mine for a few months and the dept that put it in will take it out.  I am also confused about the \"address list being snail mailed\".  Is that for the secret pal thing or so we can keep in touch or did I just really miss the boat.  I don't have any problems at all with it.  Just think I missed the post that talked about it and can't seem to find it. SuePeet - I had a Power Port put in and haven't really had any problems.  It is under the skin so no problems with water or anything once the small incision heals.  I would prefer it over a pic line for sure.  The only real downfall is having to be poked through the skin each time but there are creams to deaden the skin.  They also don't knock you out to put it in. Not sure if that was an issue for you. Well, I read the directions for the treadmill last night so am ready to go.  How far?  I'm sure it will be short for a while but at least I will be doing something.  It looks much bigger than it looked in the store and has all kinds of cool bells and whistles. Hope everyone if having a cool day.  I am looking forward to Friday.  Headed out of town and hope to do a little trout fishing on the river.  Trying to get my mood back up and back to having as normal a life as possible.  Also need to get strength back for the Race this year in October.  I know it is not far but heck, it would feel like 50 miles right now. Catch ya later......back to work",

LJ13 - Thanks for the encouragement regarding the leg pain.    It is so horrible sometimes and while I do have pain medication for it, I think I have been taking it long enough that it really doesn't last very long anymore.   I am hanging in there.  I drag myself to work everyday and put my feet up (sometime with shoes, sometimes not).  Thank God I have an understanding employer. The megadose Vit D is a once a week pill if I understand my doctor right. D1 - I am trying to build up on the treadmill,  just hard after being at work all day and wanting nothing more than the pain to let up.  I will keep trying though.  It might help with the swelling.  I am almost wishing the toenails would just go ahead and go so the soreness there would go away too.  WAAAAAHHHHH!    Ok, got the boo-hoo out.  I can go on now.  Hope your LE issues are going well.  I pick up some fingerless gloves on friday to help my wrist and hand.  Not too bad and I want it to stay that way. Better get back to it. Thanks for listening.",

SheShe48 - Great pics and neat scarf and medal.  Sorry it took so long for a shout out. SISKimberly- thanks for letting out your feelings.  Sure made the rest of us able to share also.  I hope things continue to move along with you sister.  And where were you when I was going to school?  Your little experiment sounds awesome!  I wish I would have had someone like that when I was going to school.  And I love the poem.  One of the best metaphors I have read in a while.  (at least I think it is a metaphor) I guess I better get back to work.

And I'm sorry but it was a page back about the eyesight change so I can't remmeber who was talking about it.....  I never thought about it possibly be caused by \"straining\" but I am struggling to get a pair of glasses I can see out of again.  Using readers and an old pair to get by but the new ones I just got are not going to work so back they go on Friday.

D1- I can never thank you enough for all the good recommendations and hints to survive all of this.  You are the bomb! It is the end of day 5 post treatment #1.  My worst days were day 3 and 4 and it was fatigue, weakness and lack of appetite. If that is how each one goes, I can't really complain (I might whine some though).  My next treatment is the 25th provided blood work ok.  Going to try to work full days all week this week.

Kimberly- great poem once again.  Are you feeling better?  I think I have my next treatment before you this time (the 25th) Jenny- I had my port the day before I started treatment.  I am glad that I got it as I only have one arm they can use and my veins are not that great either.  It really isn't so bad once you get a week behind it.  I will ask for the EMLA cream next time though.  The sting doesn't last long but there is enough to deal with to not be comfortable.  You and I will be having treatment the same day.  You will be in my thoughts and prayers. Vettegal - looks like you start on the same day that I have the 2nd treatment.  Hope you are feeling better and ready to go.  Will keep you in my prayers. D1 - the foot rub sounds great but where I am, no one is allowed in the \"chemo bar\" except those having \"chemotinis\".  Next time, I think I am taking a DVD player or my laptop to watch a movie.

I hope everyone else who had treatment today did fine and is feeling well.

D1 and others that are suffering from neuropathy, I just read an article in the March/April AARP magazine that says L-Glutamine in specific doses may help prevent numbness, tingling and pain in patients receiving Taxol for bc.  You could probably read the article on line at www.aarpmagazine.org They also say that B6 can help with redness, pain and peeling of the palms and soles in certain types of chemo.  To those with treatments, hoping all goes smoothly and with no se's. As for me, I'm bummed that I am missing work.  While I am normally suffering from constipation, today it is the opposite.  I could only work half day yesterday and am missing the whole day today.  This fatigue sucks (did I say that already) Well, gotta go (literally) Catch you later!",

Anyway, I bought the first season of \"Dexter\" today.  What a weird series but I saw the pilot and really liked the concept of the story.  Will probably watch during treatment friday. Speaking of friday.....looks like there are a few other that will be joining me.  I am pretty excited to be having the LAST of the Red Devil.  No more AC for me and on to Taxol.  I know, whole new beast but I am ready to fight it. I am exhausted and that just never seems to get better. But there are some on here that are suffering se's much worse than me and I keep praying that they will recover faster each time. Will touch base again tomorrow and try to do more personal shout outs. Be well.",

Love the pictures that everyone has posted.  Still dealing with small issues related to dp's mom passing but for the most part, everything is returning to normal.  She will be missed.  I can't remember exactly who was saying that they were trying to approach their parents to get wills, etc in order. (Tina maybe?) Sorry my brain isn't working today and afraid if I go back to look, will lose everything.  I don't have an easy answer for you.  When it was my grandparents, it was actually easier than I thought it would be and they were really receptive to the discussion.  The thing that I found to be most important though was making sure you understood what their wishes were in regards to extraordinary means.  The possessions part can be worked out in most loving families, but when it comes down to having to make the decisions about feeding tubes and resuscitation.....it is best to have a living will.  Sorry about the morbid topic but it is a neccessity of life and too few deal with it til too late. Ok, my hands have had enough right now.  Will try to check in later.",

One question......Is there anyone else out there that just can't seem to remember things because their brain is too full?  I can usually recall almost anything but this last week has been horrible and I haven't even started chemo yet.

I will be right there with you Friday for our first new adventure with the new drug (T).  I'm a little apprehensive but thanks to Tina, a little less so.(Ativan is helping too) Thanks Kimberly for the positive thoughts.  You truly are a \"SIS\" in a lot of concepts of the word. Tina - you have taken so much of my anxiety away about the Taxol.  I will be reading every word you write this week.  Thanks so much. And to everyone who is giving me recommendations on where to travel, thanks.  I am going to start travelling whenever I can when this is over.  Will start with short trips in my state and then venture onward. The only thing is I have no desire to travel outside of the good ole USA. Time to eat a little something and soak in the tub.  Check in tomorrow.   ((((HUGS)))",

No family history except maternal grandmother and she did not die from that (car wreck).  History of thyroid and autoimmune problems is all I had.",

All is well though here and no more expected for a few days.  This has been an incredibly dangerous spring weather wise. Thanks D1 for confirming my \"normalness\". Goodnight Jewels, going to watch Moonlight and probably doze off on the couch til dp comes home.  She is at a martial arts seminar (4th degree black belt Taekwondo).  Why people pay to have people beat them up I will never know but I did learn to love watching the Mixed Martial Arts.

I'm sorry, but there is just something about the words \"hoot in a box\" that cracks me up.  Thanks for the chuckle this afternoon. Hope everyone is off for the long weekend whether to be lazy or having something planned.  As for me, I will be floating on the White River Saturday with my dp and a guide trying to catch brown trout.  I will of course let all of them go if they will just play the game with me for a bit.  I am definitely a catch and release fisherman most of the time.  Only keep what I can eat that day and usually don't do that either. Well, the weekend is almost here.  Hope everyone continues to improve either as they are finished or nearing the finish line. ",

Have a question.....has anybody else been diagnosed as vitamin D deficient?  I think you are supposed to be 32 or above, I am at 8.  Been reading and there are alot of studies going on about the connection to breast cancer and recovery from BC.  It also has been noted to help with pain.  I am still looking it up and reading about it.  I am going on mega dose D once a week and am really hoping that it does help with pain issues because I am sure not doing too well in that category right now.  From my hips down, it seems I am always hurting or burning or feeling so over fatigued that I just don't want to do anything.  Sometimes it even affects my shoulders.  Haven't been on the treadmill hardly at all.  My calves and ankles are swollen.  Will be asking about that at the LE clinic but that isn't until Aug 5th.  Was just wondering if anyone else was having vitamin D issues or was aware of the studies.  From what I am reading, everyone should be checked. Looks like lunch is over. Catch ya'll later!",

I printed it out.  They kind of scare you about that but I have been wanting to do light weights.  Your schedule seems to be a slow and steady one that might work.  The last line about painting and raking kinda sounded like you were maybe speaking from personal experience? Rainy here today and trying to stay awake at work.  Still taking meds for the neuropathy.  Anyone else still having any problems with that?  And did anyone find something that helps with that besides meds?  It is really my only side effect that is left (remnants of chemo brain but so much better I can live with it).  I have found that as I got further in my treatment plan, my pain threshold plummeted.  Before, I could just about handle any pain but now.......  Still looking for Tai Chi class.  Will work on that tomorrow as I am off and going to be around the house anyway.  I did find someone that specializes in Oncology massage though and am planning to call and schedule that as well.

One more thing........I WANT MY PORT OUT!  Sorry to yell but I am really just wanting it gone.  The lump is like a constant reminder and I want it gone.  Looks like it won't go until after January sometime.  UGH!

One good thing for me I guess is that I don't have to worry about the hair loss.  I lost my hair about 3 years ago due to some weird, rare, autoimmune disorder so I am used to the wigs, doo-ags, etc.  Just have to wait and see what happens with the eyebrows and eyelashes.  I didn't lose those then so maybe they will be stubborn now too..  Who knows, maybe this will make my hair grow back!  Wouldn't that be a hoot?!?!

Trying to make it through the day at work today but not sure I can go to the end.  I am so tired.  I guess if I am going to have any se's, this is an ok one to have. Sorry I am being a little selfish today.  Feel like if I could sleep for a week, I would be ready to go. Hope those that were struggling with se's are doing better. (((((Hugs))))) to billsgirl and Amy that were starting today. I will try to get more caught up later. Hey Kimberly----how are you doing?  You sounded like you were doing well. I was wondering about a couple of things..... Is there anyone else that decided against recontruction after bilateral mast, and how are people handling being so tired at work?",

Hope everyone is relatively se free today.  I never really had a relapse except for fatigue. Looks like friday Feb 2nd will be my next attempt at treatment #2.  Hopefully my ANC will come up.  Thanks to everyone that helped me understand that.  After #2, I will be taking the Neupogen and Procrit injections so hopefully that will keep my treatment plan on schedule. Well, looks like lunch time is over. Catch ya'll later!",

PaLady - Love the pics.  You look good with the balditude and personally, I like the shorter hair better and the wig is awesome on you. D1- Like the new FUBC translation though I will probably be thinking the other more often.  I won't wear it to church. Paula - Glad your treatment went well.  I thought I was the only one with \"foghead\" from the Cytoxan.  The steroid kicked in good this time and I hope I can sleep tonight.  Was hungry when I got home and had a sandwich.  Feeling ok and will stay on top of the anti-nausea meds.  Hope your weekend is se free.  I start Procrit and neupogen injections tomorrow.  That should be interesting since I give them to myself.  Fortunately, I have no fear of needles and used to work in the veterinary field so am familiar with all of the shot giving and drawing blood.  I guess I am an animal too so should be ok.  Lidocaine gel will be my friend also. Sorry for the minimal shout outs.  To those not feeling well, hope all is better soon.  Sorry to hear of the muscle spasms and lack of compassion from the oncs.  Is the Claritin not working to help? We are blessed more everyday.  We will get through this and we will get through this together.  Sleep well gems.",

Not much time but wanted to shout out to D1 about therapy......Your therapist is pretty much right about the being a safe place to get things out.  Think about how long you have kept things inside.  You won't get them all out over night.  You do have to build a relationship with the therapist for sure but my best advice is talk, talk, and talk some more and get as much out as you can.  You may not think you are getting resolution soon enough, but you may surprise yourself by some of the things that come out.  You might also look at group therapy.  I never thought it would work for me but I actually found it easier to talk when I realized I wasn't the only one feeling the way I was. And I wasn't so bothered by the silent periods that seem to be in one to one.  I always felt like their wasn't feedback.  There is, but it is hard for me to talk about things anyway so easier when it was a group.  Just a thought.  I have been thinking about going back myself to deal with some issues as I recover and am not being patient about it.  Not sure I was much help but hope so. Will try to catch up and do some more shout outs later. I am truly Blessed to have been a part of this message board and am so thankful to D1 for starting it and everyone for contributing and helping each other.",

SISKimberly - sounds like we are having some of the same se's.  Neuropathy, feeling like I am 90 years old after sitting a long time and the GI tract problems. I had reached a point where my gut was getting back to normal but this month has been real bad.  And some depression but I think that is from chronic pain in my legs and trying to quit taking pain meds. I am sick of taking medicine and haven't had a beer or glass of wine in over a year.  It is long overdue. Legs get to feeling like I would imagine restless legs is if I don't take pain meds.  And I am hoping that my onc will agree to let me get my port out.  Tired of that reminder too. Anyway, I will be thinking about you Thursday as you see your onc.  I will be giving mine an earful Friday. Joan - Of course you can enjoy your own room.  I usually do the same but think I am bringing my partner since she has never seen Vegas. Well, the Lady Razorbacks basketball team is actually going to be on TV so I will catch ya'll later!  Oh, and check out my new signature......it reminded me of all of us. ",

I was happy to be able to get to work today and actually stay until 2 this afternoon.  But now I am pooped and ready to get my feet up.  They are not quite so stinging today.  My hands are not painful anymore but now are peeling.  And what is it with my eyes?  They are so watery and burn and all around my eyes is tender.  Woke up this morning and my eyes were crusted shut.  Sorry gross.  Using eye drops but doesn't seem to help with the weepiness.  And it is mostly when I have been at the computer too long or reading.  Well, 3 more to go so I am thankful.  And I am thankful for everyone here that always has a good word.

Vettegal, you sound like you are doing much better today.  I enjoyed a quiet evening too and am getting ready to enjoy a cup of coffee.  Think I will be trying to drink alot of coffee this week in case my taste buds change.  I would surely miss my coffee.  Your hubby sounds wonderful and Oscar is very cute.  My kids are on the furry side too! To those who started last week, hope you are still feeling well or feeling better anyway.  To those starting this week (((((HUGS))))). Hope you breeze right through it. Happy New Year all!",

I haven't caught up yet on all the posts but sounds like most are doing well. Thunderstorms and rain here today, good for sleeping, not good for the tornado victims trying to get their life back together. Will be lurking today and try to catch up later. Oh, and add me to the triple negative list.  Hope everyone has a terrific Tuesday.",

I am nowhere caught up with messages yet.  Will try to read more later. Hope everyone is keeping the se's at bay this time.",

Tina - Thanks for the reassurance about the Taxol.  I think I will do the Claritin also.  Is it just the regular Claritin? And not the \"D\"?  And please keep me posted on how your se's go.  Hopefully none for you. I have my first Taxol on Friday the 14th. SIS Kimberly- I also love cinnamon on my applesauce.  Quite the treat and is good for you too. As for more time between infusions, I will still be at every 2 weeks.  But if I can hang in, that will make me done at the end of April.  Thanks for the encouragement.  It really does help.  As gross as it may sound, I didn't have hemorrhoids before I am sure I do now.  Catch 22, you want to poop but oh no you really don't.  Some days, I pray for diarrhea.   The snow was beautiful and I was able to get some pictures but it is sunny today and most of it melted.  Think it is supposed to get up to 60 or so for a few days. Julie- Lurk away.  I was doing that for a week.  I understand about the energy thing as I have none.  I tried something different this morning and am going to try and do it more often....I have been so consumed by my life WITH cancer that I have forgotten what it was like BEFORE cancer.  And I was getting really depressed these last few days and thought that if I can't concentrate on what it was like BEFORE, then maybe I can really DWELL on what my life is going to be like AFTER cancer.  I appreciate a lot more now than I did before and no more, someday. There is only now.  There are things I want to do and things dp and I have been wanting to do but never seemed to have the time.  The time is coming.  Anyway, call it meditation or whatever but those thoughts in the morning are sure better that having the first thought be about cancer.  Hope you are feeling better very soon. D1 - Sorry that you are suffering from the lymphedema probs.  I have been so lucky so far.  I am seeing my surgeon again on Tuesday and am going to have her really look closely to make sure there is nothing developing.  May also find out about getting a sleeve just in case I fly.  You have been such an inspiration to all of us.  I really hope that there comes a time that we can find a place in the middle and actually get to meet as a group.  Maybe everyone could start putting their state with there name so we can see. Most do but there are a few that do not.  Anyway, we all love ya and hope that now things can start going your way with less worries.  And yes, I am ok.  Thanks for asking.  Was just down in the dumps a little longer this time.  Took me longer to dig out.  Oh, and I have been taking Ativan and it really seems to help keep me at a more even keel.  A little loopy but I will take it.  Oh and one last note, it is probably a good thing you can't pick your nose. KathyL-  In regards to fearing you wouldn't get published....the reward is in getting it out of your head and then seeing what you can do with it.  I have always teased myself with the thought of getting published one day. But look at all that we have written in a short time.  So I say, WRITE!  You can always edit later and maybe submit somewhere and be published.  There are several writer mags that have small contest and then there is always the big writing challenge in November where you try to write a novel in 30 days (50,000 words).  You can check it out at http://www.nanwrimo.org/              Pretty cool.  I have never finished but this year I think I may have a lot more to say.  So as they say, write and then write some more but don't edit til you are done or you will never get done. Well, I have rattled on trying to make up for what I have missed.  I love you all and there is one thing I would like to hear from everyone......where are good places for short vacations in the US?  Interests would be easy hiking, bird watching, astronomy and other outdoors type stuff.  Like eclectic shopping and coffee stops. Just something for me to think about doing after all of this is over.  I already have Montana in my sights for some really cool telescope time. TTFN Deb",

D1 - you are right about warm water, anything that is warm just makes my fingertips sting.  Did you have any problems with the bottom of your feet?  Mine is mostly just my heels so I tippy toe sometimes around the house. Paula - Glad you are doing ok after the Taxol.  I also find it has less tummy problems than the AC. Jennifer- I have had 2 ChemoAngels since the beginning and they are great!  The cards and little gifts always seem to brighten any day. Hope the rest of the Jewels are doing well.  I just keep telling myself that this will be over soon and can start trying to get back to normal. Will check in later.",

Thanks for listening and thanks to all that gave me shout outs to hang in there.  I am trying.  Just glad that it is March Madness and I can get my fill of not the men's and women's b-ball tourneys.

Paula and KathyL - my treatments are going to 3 weeks apart. New dates are April 3rd, April 24th and May 15 as of now.  If changes, will let you know.  I was really wanting to get done with them but don't want to suffer permanent neuropathy either and since only 3 left, was a little more willing to go along than I was at treatment 1. Some of the redness has gone away and the swelling is going down.  Didn't have to wake up to take pain meds so that is good.  Going to try and go to work tomorrow and finally earn some money.  And get off the couch.  I never thought I would be so excited to get back to work. D1 - I think Duke women play tonight or tomorrow night.  They made it to the 2nd round and should do ok against Arizona State. Carol - We are each spiritual in our own ways.  You do not have to be in a special bldg to have a relationship with God so you talk to him whenever and wherever is good for you.  He listens to the prayers no matter where they come in from.  When I played golf, I prayed ALOT. Julie - In answer to your question, my onc said they would be following up with me about every 3 months for probably the first year or two with exams and scans, then out to 6 months and so on.  Will probably get clearer details as I reach the chemo finish line. Maz- I know I haven't really piped in much on your news about your BFF.  I was so sorry to hear about it and will pray for Val.  I don't know what I would do if it was my BFF but it is comforting to know I could come here and rant and rave and blow off steam. Hope you know that too. Paula - Sorry I won't be on the same schedule as you anymore, I kinda was comforted by the fact that we were doing the same thing and on the same days.  I am ready to be done too.  And I wish I had your \"guts\" to go topless.  I have been without hair for about 3 years and I still grab a hat or hair whenever I leave the house. PALady - Hope the toenails hang on and don't remain painful.  I can sympathize on the foot pain.  I can't even wear regular shoes right now.  They are a little too tight due to a little swelling.  Well, I guess I will give the hands a rest.  Love all the Jewels and hope the se's stay far, far away from everyone.",

Been lurking but wanted to shout out to Carol, Maz and Wendy for their day at the bar.  Hope it goes great. Dana - So sorry to hear of all that has been going on with you.  You are one of the strongest people and your faith just helps keep me going alot of times.  Someone shared this with me and I really liked it and thought maybe you could enjoy it to. PS..Someone sent this to me today and I wanted to share it with you. Smart\" God Make haste to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer . . . Psalm 70:5 Recommended Reading Psalm 116:1-5 Advances in the field of medicine never cease to amaze us. Currently, research is being done on an advanced delivery system of medicine to the body using nanoscale particles. Scientists and researchers hope that by using these tiny particles, the presence of drug molecules will increase wherever they are needed in the body and wherever they will do the most good. In essence, they hope to create a \"smart\" way to deliver medicine directly to the sick cells in a person's body.* While we must wait for this technology to be available, we have a \"smart\" God who is able to target exactly where we are hurting or in need and deliver His healing to us right now. The Bible says, \"Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need\" (Hebrews 4:16). Trust God in your time of need, for He loves you and cares deeply for you. He is longing to help; He knows exactly what you need and what will do the most good for you. Believe it and be comforted! Where there is pain, there is healing. Where there is mourning, there is dancing. Where there is poverty, there is the kingdom. Henri J. M. Nouwen Sis Kimberley - it is always good to hear from you again and glad you are coming back to brighter days. Maz - all I can say ....(((HUGS))) Paula - Congrats on the award. Would also like to see the link if one comes up.  It is always very special when someone takes the time to go above and beyond to let you know you are cared about and respected. Sorry for the limited shout outs.  Been lurking.  Not liking Taxotere at all.  Bone aches, fatigue and just overall air headiness are horrible.  I know I only have one more to go but that still seems a long way off.  My hands are peeling, feet will be peeling, feel like someone hit me with a hammer......repeatedly.  I went to work yesterday and lasted 5 hours.  Not going today.  My thoughts are so out of control and lost I have no concentration.   This time has been the worst so far.  And did I mention the bone pain???? ANNOYING and painfull.  To top it off, my coworker gave notice so is leaving before I even finish treatment.  There are only 3 of us in my office right now so of course that is going to make me want to suck it up and be there everday.  BUT not today. I know that there are others that have suffered alot more than I have and I truly do pray for everyone here that it will get easier and be over soon.  I just needed to get it out of my system.  People tell me that I am looking good and doing very well.  While I think I have aged 10 years on the outside (eyes and skin), how do you explain what is really going on on the inside?  It is so hard to describe what they can't see.  Don't get me wrong, everyone has been so supportive, my partner, friends, work....I guess it is just me.  I realized the other day that I have not cried once since I was diagnosed.  How weird is that?  Heck, I didn't cry WHEN I was diagnosed.  My surgeon almost did but not me. OK, think I have purged for a while now.  Sorry so long.  Wish I was more support for more people.  I can just keep trying. Love you all and all are in my prayers.",

Carol - Would definitely like the list by snail mail.  Will it include B-days that are know or just get them from the header here? SISKimberly - Your trip sounded great.  I LOVE Sydney Poitier.  He is one of the best actors and people of the last couple of generations.  It is great that you were able to get his signature.  Pictures look great too. Cathy-CA - I thought I would like the companionship of the gym (and I do) but I also like that I can control the climate and what I wear at home. Since I have not had reconstruction yet, I do get a little self conscious in some situations.  That is getting to be less but still sometimes. Did anyone else use ChemoAngels?  I just wanted to say that it was a really great program to have a couple of people sending you cards and little gifts every week while in chemo.  Mine is over now and I will miss them. Fortunately, I can still keep in touch occasionally.  They were the best! Well, better get back to work!  Catch ya later.",

I was wondering if anyone is going to the \"Cure, Patient and Survivor Forum\" in Dallas?  It is Nov 1st and 2nd.  I think I am going to check it out.  Sounds like alot of good info.  If anyone reads \"Cure\" magazine, some details are in the current issue.  Subscription is free for first year for patients. At work, so will check in again later.  Hope everyone is doing great and getting back into the swing after a short week.",

Still wiped out from the RFC but it was worth it.  I hear some of you talking about toenail woes.  Anybody still waiting for them to fall off?  My big toes look like they are separated from the nail bed but haven't budged as far as falling off.  Look ugly as hell but thankfully are not too painful. Carol - I really enjoyed yoga when I did it too but it really has a lot to do with who leads it and what kind it is.  Right now I am looking for a Tai Chi or Chi Quong class.  Slow stretching type movements too. Oh, and my work schedule just changed to every other Friday off (jealous yet?)so I can look forward to 3 day weekends every other.  And best of all, my Fridays are the ones after Thanksgiving and Christmas this year.  Since we already get those days off, I get extra vacation days added for those days.  Sure will help me build my time up again. Kimberly - Hope you and your sis are hanging in there.  We are all praying for you. Carla - It is really rough for you right now.  I am hoping you find the strength that you need for you and your girls.  Prayers your way that God shows you a way out. Guess I better get back to work. Catch ya later!",

And while I AM salivating for the Bellagio buffet, I doubt I would be able to afford to stay there.  Mandalay Bay is looking better and better and I don't mind walking, just a little slow some times.  I have also heard that there is a shuttle that runs in the area that is like $5 for a 24 hour period.  Sounds good to me and eliminates need for rental car.  I am figuring we are not all going to be spending 24/7 with each other anyway.  Sounds like there are a variety of interests like trips and dinners and gambling or no.  Will be nice to have a central hub and meeting place though.  Think it will vary with what different people can afford too.  As for me, a nice hotel is great but I don't plan on being in the room much so as long as is clean, I am ok.  Would rather spend my money at the outlet center and the slots.  YES, I am a \"slot puppy\".   Just my 2 cents and you know how much that is worth.  Love ya all and every time I get a quarter in change, I am thinking of this trip!",

I will be trying facebook this weekend to see if I can become technologically advanced. And I believe the Aladdin is now Planet Hollywood.  The casino has been remodeled, not sure about the rooms. Well, imagine that, time to get off work.  Will check in this weekend and let you know whether I am an FB'er or not. Go Cardinals!!!! ",
