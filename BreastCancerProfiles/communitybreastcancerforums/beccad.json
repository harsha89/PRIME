I am not liking the new darker color that I seem to have along with the gray sideburn thing that seems to be going on here.

Oh, I did see the bone scans images and I did not see any bone involvement,  ( not an official report, just a Nuclear Medicine Tech. seeing her own images!)  The tech who did my injection was a very sweet girl who may end up working for me on a part=time basis, and the tech who did my scan, was also very kind and caring.  I did not know what to expect from them since they are  at a huge facility in our area.  The thech at the PET Imaging place I felt was not as compassionate. That may just me and my expectations,though.  Oh, btw, at our weekly sit and stitch last night, I was suprised with an impromptu B-day party, and a friend who's DD has 1 year out post surgery, and chemo, brought wigs, hat, scarves and othe goodies for me to try before spending lots of $$$ on those items.  Plus lots of hugs and emergency chocolate was brought to me.  Now I need to hope that chocolate is not something that will not taste right to me when chemo starts next week.   Becky",

Oct 5: mammo, sono, (go back and scan 2 more patients), Core Bx. Oct 8: preliminary path report,  Invasive poorly differentiated ductal Ca, with lymph node involvement. Oct 13.  Meet with Breast surgeon,she recommends chemo, mastectomy, more chemo, with radiation. Final path report later that day, triple negative,  Oct 19: Meet with Oncologist,did lab work, we will get port inserted, and start TAC. Oct 20: (today) PET scan. Oct 21: Meet w/ general surgeon to discuss port.  ( I talked to her at work the A.M.)  Oct 22: ECHO, bone scan, bone survey, EKG  Oct 24:  HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! Oct 26: Port Insertion Oct 27: Start Chemo. Not looking forward to this, but want it GONE.  After seeing the Oncologist I am feeling better and thinking that we may be moving ahead.  I think this may sound like it is moving fast, but I can't imagine not knowing who to turn to or to put on my team.   Any suggestions of what I can do to move this any faster?
