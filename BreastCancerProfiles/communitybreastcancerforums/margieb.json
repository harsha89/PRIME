I'm not sure if this is the correct forum for my questions, but after reading through most of the posts, I have come to the conclusions that y'all probably know more about this journey that any of us. I was dx in July of 2005. I found my own lump. It was 2 cm, had 3/22 nodes, ER/PR+, Her-. I don't remember what grade is was. I had a lumpectomy, followed by 6 TAC chemo doses, and 33 rads. I was then put on tamoxifen in March of 2006. I had a PET/CT scan in August of 05 BEFORE chemo. Two places lit up, one in the liver and one in T-4. I had a biopsy of live (which nearly killed me) and it was B9. I had other liver issues from a gallbladder surgery, so my onc/surgeon felt it was from that. But after all my treatment, my next PET/CT was normal. Nothing lit up. That was in May of 06. Then I had my normal onc visits and another PET/CT in Jan of 07. All was clear again. In June I had a bleeding episode and went to Gyno, had a biopsy of uterine lining and transvag ultrasound. My lining was 9mm, which 5mm is normal. My biopsy was normal. He said ovaries looked a little enlarged. He wanted me to consider a total hysterectomy. I went to my scheduled onc appt. in July, and she said to hold off, and let her see if I was in menopause, because it was her plan from the beginning to change from tamoxifen to arimidex after 2 years. When she called me back about blood work she said my tumor marker had gone way up. It was the ca2729. She said I am always high, and it had gone up in January, but I had a normal PET/CT so she didn't get too concerned. But it was 60 something in Jan and now it was 120. So she ordered a PET/CT scan. Two places lit up, she said a bone in my shoulder and at L-4. Now she wanted me to have a bone biopsy on my shoulder. When I went in to do it a week later, the radiologist came and told me, he reviewed the PET/Ct and didn't want to do the shoulder it was too invasive, but he was going to biopsy T-4. I flipped out because onc said it was L-4. He said that it was a transcription error in the report to her. So I broked down and cried. Well the biopsy report was B9. My onc called me and said she is going to proceed as if it is b9 and not considered mets. My ovaries were significantly enlarged on the PET/CT so she wants to proceed with the hyster and start me on arimidex. She said this would be the protocol if the biopsy was positive, so she feels I am covered either way. So my hyster is tomorrow morning, and I am so nervous. I know that we all have more trouble dealing with the unknown. I can handle things better when I know all the facts. My questions to y'all are this: 1. Have any of you gotten false/neg results from CT guided biopsy? 2. Any of you have bone met and arimidex work to stop progression? If so, for how long? 3. If my ovaries have cysts, that could cause tumor marker rise, according to onc. Has this happened to anyone? I know we are all different, but would just like to hear from someone who has been there.
