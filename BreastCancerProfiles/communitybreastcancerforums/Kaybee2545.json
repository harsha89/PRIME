I have never had any kind of surgery or health problems, so this was all very new to me. I was really scared of the anesthesia process, etc. My surgery took 4.5 hours which seemed longer than I would have expected. It took me a long time to wake up after, close to 90 minutes. It amazed me how much work could be done and have no pain or awareness of it. They had oxygen on me and it took me awhile to be able to open my eyes once I started to wake up. I had asked for any possible nausea medicine beforehand based on a friend's experience earlier this year when she was sick for a full 48 hours after this surgery. I was terrified of that because I am susceptible to being carsick, etc. My cousin told me to just ask for everything ahead of time because they may or may not give it to you. It was probably around 5pm when they moved me to my room. I wasn't really in any pain, just not able to move a lot, but I was comfortable. I still had my IV and oxygen going, so getting up was a pain. I finally made it to the bathroom with someone watching, but I was able to get up without help (very slowly!) and she said if I was comfortable myself after that I wouldn't need to call anyone. I held off on additional pain meds because I really wasn't feeling much, but by around 11pm started feeling some soreness, so I asked for something so I could sleep. They gave me one dose of morphine, but wanted me to stick to pain pills after that. I was home by 1pm the next day. The pain has not been intense, more just soreness. I have been trying not to take too many pain pills because of the constipation. I spent nearly an hour in the bathroom yesterday, sorry for TMI, but get your Colace or milk of magnesia ready! I was thrilled that I could get around by myself. My husband was planning to stay home for the week if needed, but I told him yesterday he might as well go back to work because I was able to fend for myself. I wasn't even sure if I'd be able to empty my own drains, but it has been easy, just a pain to have them. I managed a shower yesterday which other than trying to figure out what to do with the drains, felt great. I look scary, but I had looked at enough \"after\" pictures that I was prepared. I don't really have bruising, but I am very lopsided at the moment and one side is lumpy. And of course the stitches from the incision. I had tissue expanders put in and they were able to inject some saline, I'm not sure how much, but they were able to get more in the right side. I can use my arms more than I thought, just not for anything heavy. For anyone that has breastfed, the way I feel now is if I were breastfeeding and became engorged. Just like my chest is exploding and tight. It's not really painful, though, just more uncomfortable. I am not sure if my experience is normal or not. My two friends who had this done are close to my age and found it to be much more difficult, so that is what I was prepared for. I don't believe either one could get up without help for a few days. I did have a mini-meltdown for the first time this morning because I've been telling everyone how great it went, how thankful I am, how well I'm doing, etc., and it's really not that easy as I'm making it sound, so when my husband was leaving I just started sobbing because I do just feel useless. We have 4 kids and he is responsible for getting them everywhere right now which is really hard. We also work together, so he has to pick up my slack there as well. I just sit in front of the fire all day reading or on the computer and while I know it's what I should be doing, I feel really bad like I'm being lazy. Sorry so long, but just wanted to share my experience! Hopefully when the drains come out I will be feeling more human. That's the other thing... I'm not sure if I am supposed to just do nothing so not as much fluid drains and I can get them out sooner? I believe more activity increases the output, so I'm not sure what is best. My first appointment is Tuesday, and I'd love to be rid of them then!",

I think I annoyed my anesthesiologist the day of surgery because I was concerned about nausea based on a friend's experience and the way I get motion sickness. My cousin had advised me to ask for every anti nausea med they had, and the pre op nurse agreed with me. The anesthesiologist kind of blew off my concerns and said the meds that were included would be enough. I didn't really argue, but when the nurse came back, she asked if he had given them to me. I told her what happened and she was annoyed. She went and got me a pill and a patch. When I saw him again 5 minutes before the surgery, he had heard I had taken the meds and started telling me all the side effects of them and why he doesn't recommend them. I guess he thought I had gone behind his back which really wasn't the case, but I didn't like his passive aggressive attitude. Oh well, I got my way anyways, but I agree in taking care of it ahead of time. And I had no side effects that he mentioned whatsoever! Prayers going up for all of the surgeries coming up next week and MKTCA today. Grandma3x, you asked how I'm doing today. I went in with worst case expectations, so I feel like I'm doing well. You can definitely do this. I do feel like I am blessed to not feel as much pain as most people, just going by this and my childbirth experiences, so again, I don't know if I'm the norm. My mom has had a mastectomy twice, 20 years apart, but without reconstruction and says she never had any pain, so it may be a genetic thing. The last pain pill I took was last night and I wasn't sure I really needed it, but wanted to be able to sleep. The most pain I really have now is from the drains pulling at my skin a little, but it's not horrible, just super annoying. I think a week with the flu would be worse than what I have experienced. (of course long term I'd rather have the flu for a week and be done). I was able to help get my 5 year old ready for bed last night by changing his clothes and brushing his teeth. I just have to be careful not to lift much. Even opening the microwave is tough. A shower is an event that takes forever to get drains situated, clothes off, etc. But I can do all of it without help, so I'm honestly enjoying the peace and quiet during the day which I never get, I normally work full time and I have 4 kids. My drain output has dropped dramatically from over 100 each side just two days ago to about 50 yesterday, and on pace for 30 today so I'm really hoping that I can get them out Tuesday. I'm going to copy a friend's experience who had a preventative bilateral mastectomy done last year with immediate reconstruction (not expanders). I was basing my expectations on this account and another friend who sounded similar. Other people, like my cousin, who has stage IV breast cancer told me it would be a \"breeze\" and I'd be surprised, so I really didn't know what to expect. I even called my doctor's office trying to get a hospital bed approved through insurance and they thought I was crazy that I thought I would need it. Her story is below: I saw that you are having nipple sparing surgery, lucky you! My breasts were too big for that. I was a DD before, now I am nice perky C! That is certainly one of the benefits for me. In order to go bigger I would have had to do tissue expanders which would have meant 2 surgeries and with Jacob being 6 months when I did this, there was no way I wanted a second surgery. If I ever decide to get it done, I will go back and they will make a nipple by putting tucks in the skin and then tattooing it, but as of now, I have no plans to do that. The day of my surgery I went in first thing in the morning, they did the surgery. Timeline for that day is a little bit iffy but I want to say I was in my room for lunch, but maybe not. I had a morphine drip that I could use when I felt I needed it. While I was there, I didn't feel the need to use it all that much. Don't get me wrong, it was super painful, but just laying in the hospital bed it wasn't all that bad. They only kept me until noon the next day. THAT I think was the hard part. I felt like an extra day in the hospital would have been awesome!!! So\u2026.Home\u2026.yeah, not as fun. Luckily, Jacob was in daycare during the day so that wasn't an issue. I obviously couldn't pick him up and that was for almost 2 months. I could sit with me but that was about it. I couldn't stand up straight and when I walked it felt best to cross my arms over my chest and kind of hold them in. I couldn't get up and down on my own. I needed help. After about a week or so, I could get in and out of a recliner by myself but not off the couch and certainly not out of bed. I couldn't get off of the toilet either. That was the worst part. And I will be honest, sometimes I even had to have Tommy wipe for me. That didn't last much beyond the first few days that I remember. It was a LONG time before I could get out of bed on my own. For the first probably month I slept on my back with my arm either by my side or crossed over my chest. Sometimes I would prop one side of my back up on a pillow just for something different. Eventually, I was able to kind of roll to my side and then sit up, but that took a while. They gave me percoset and as long as I stayed on top of it, I didn't have a ton a pain when just sitting, it was when I was trying to get up and down that it was the worst. But let's talk about the stupid bra!!! I HATED IT! It clipped in the back and zipped up the front between the boobs. It was one of those things where it was super painful when you unzipped it but once the girls were free it was kind of like an ahhhhh moment. I would stay unzipped for about 20 minutes or so. Tommy had to redress the incisions for me so he would take of the old, put on new and then zip me back up. HOLY MOLY was the zipping up awful. I found that if I pulled it tight for him to just zip, it wasn't as bad. They recommended I take arnica tablets which I did, and I also but the arnica gel to rub on but never needed it. They told me the heeling process would be about 2 months. I didn't believe them. I should have. I am not one to sit around and do nothing and that is what I did for literally the first month. During the second month, I got super depressed. I just wasn't bouncing back as quickly as I expected myself to, but it was certainly right on schedule. I cried a lot. I am not going to lie. It was really hard. My mom had the same surgery about 25 years ago so it was helpful that I had her there. I am fortunate that I was having this done as a preventative measure and not because I was diagnosed. We have a very strong history in our family and I had my first mammo at 30. I also had bilateral cysts which were super painful most of the time and I had super dense tissue. There were lots of times right after the surgery where I had said to myself, had I known this is what recovery was going be like, I never would have done this. But a year later, I can honestly say I am happy I did. My scars are still ugly and gross and nowhere near fading and I have no nipples, but I have a little piece of mind that breast cancer is no longer something that might be in my future. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask. Even if you think it's too personal or anything. I mean let's be honest\u2026once you have to have someone wipe for you, there's pretty much nothing left that might embarrass you anymore\u2026LOL",

I also felt more justified in my BMX decision, but like you, concerned about what to do with ovaries, etc. in the future.

I have mainly soreness. Every time an area becomes less sore and I think I'm \"home free,\" something new pops up. I now have the armpit soreness that I didn't have any of the first week. Strange how our bodies work. This was not the plan at all, but I actually drove to my appointment this morning by myself. My husband was supposed to take all of our kids to school (3 different places) and come back to get me there by 8:45. He left early to make sure, but snow was coming down and it was slower than expected. Rather than have to cancel my appointment (I really wanted those drains out!) I decided to drive because I really felt okay. I wouldn't have gone if it was far or on a highway, but I was okay with a short distance. I don't plan on venturing out again any time soon, though. Just spending my days while kids are at school in front of the fire, watching the snow fall. It's not a horrible thing, I won't lie:).",
