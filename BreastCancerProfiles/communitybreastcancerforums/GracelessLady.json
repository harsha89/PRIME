So, a little background: diagnosed this May at age 41 IDC in R breast, stage IIA, grade 2, 1/3 sentinel nodes with micrometastasis, ER+, PR+, HER2-. Had a lumpectomy with bilateral reduction in June. Just had my 4th round of TC. And here I am. The chemo plan was to \"get to 4 for sure, but 6 if we can.\" \"We\" (I) am feeling done with chemo. I know people have probably been through a lot worse, but my body, mind, spirit want to leave the chemo behind. My oncologist said it's up to me. He says there's a \"small, incremental improvement\" to going to 6, but ultimately it's my choice. I'm just feeling soooo worn out; the effects are really getting to me. And there's still a lot ahead of me: radiation, most likely induced menopause/ovary removal, hormone therapy. So, wonderful as you ladies are, I know you can't make the decision for me. I would, however, love to hear about your experiences, thoughts. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
