Two of my aunts died from cancer and one was diagnoseed with breast cancer last year, so my doctor told me to have an ultrasound. I was diagnosed with multiple fibroadenomas in both breasts, with the largest one being the one I felt and measuring 20mm in length. They haven't been causing me pain or anything, though my left breast seems to have the larger lumps. I have been concerned lately as I've started to develop pain in my left breast near to my armpit and close to the largest lump. It's probably been going on for the last week and feels like a dull burn or ache. I originally just thought it could be caused by my period, but that doesn't usually give me tenderness.

I'm 26 and have 14 fibroadenomas (about to see a specialist about one of them) and several have grown rapidly in a short time. As far as I know, our hormone levels can affect fibroadenomas - they often grow and shrink around our period. Perhaps the fact you're no longer taking oral birth control will affect them. Please don't feel stupid. For any person, finding something growing can be scary. It's perfectly legitimate to be concerned. If there's good reason to remove the growth, and if surgeon is recommending it, it's probably good to go that path. Try to stay positive and stay off Google - it doesn't help.

I also read that it's possible, but rare, for a FA to become a phyllodes. I don't know if that's what happened with me, as my first biopsy on it was this year and the previous two U/S I had said it was for sure FA. Really wishing you all the best.

It's almost doubled in size (according to my self-exam). Maybe I've just become really hormonal and things are growing. The doc wasn't sure if it was a fibroadenoma - she said a cyst could have started to grow, or it could be another kind of tumour...anyway, I am looking forward to having an answer, whatever it might be! The sister in charge of our convent is very supportive of me, and I feel really blessed by that. My family has a history of cancer, not breast though - two of my mother's sisters passed away in their 30s from cancer, one had a cancer scare a while ago, and my mother has very dense breasts so has regular checks.

I can really understand you - you hear that something is benign and just get on with your life as normal! I've always heard that fibroadenomas can't (or very rarely) become cancerous, but I really do want to be sure about this one. My last US was three years ago, so I don't exactly know when the fibro started to change. This year has been the biggest change as I've noticed a new lump growing so close to the old lump it really does feel like it's growing from it. This new lump has grown quickly and is visible through the skin, and if the two fibroadenomas are measured together the whole thing would be 6cm. So many things are happening in my life right now - this, possible new job (interview next week) and preparing for vows with my order. My superior told me that this health problem will not prevent me from making my profession of vows, which I was really happy about! I am going to the doctor today and I will ask her for the biopsy. Honestly, thinking about having a biopsy does make me a bit nervous, but the radiologist did recommend it and I do really want to know if it is OK.",

She said that even if the result is normal, she wants me to see a breast surgeon as I have multiple tumours (and several new ones since my last scan three years ago). Most were confirmed as fibroadenomas. She said it is unusual for a young woman to have so many at once (11), and multiple new ones in such a short space of time. I asked her what her opinion is about the problem lump. The U/S was unable to confirm what it is. She told me that she really wouldn't be surprised if it's atypical. I really appreciate her honesty, though it's hard not to be anxious at the prospect of tests and possible surgery, and uncomfortable at the thought of someone looking at my breasts (as a sister, this is even more awkward for me). I just feel really tired by everything happening so fast, in the space of one week. Almost every day this week I've been doing something medical. And I honestly didn't expect it to be such a problem in there. I think I just need a bit of a breather, to accept that while I'm trying to stay calm, something serious is going on. I think tomorrow I will ask for the day off to relax, sleep, cry (not because I'm sad, but I just feel so tense!). Even if no one answers here (and it's okay if that's the case), it's really helpful to vent. I actually shared my situation with one of my sisters today (no one else knows besides my superior) and she really did help - she had breast cancer a while ago and so does understand. I'm also aware that I need to prepare for the reality of telling my very caring but naturally protective parents that I am not well (especially my lovely but worrying mother).  ",

For me it did look like one lump, but she documented it as two. When she did the doppler (?) test there was a lot of colour and she asked me if I've ever had any of my lumps biopsied (no). She got me to hum a lot during the scan! She was really good considering that I counted at least 12 lesions in my breasts. I pick up the results tomorrow and will go back to the doc to find out what's going on.",

It turns out that my fibroadenoma was not a fibroadenoma at all, but a phyllodes tumour with some abnormality. I was VERY surprised as every single test I have had, including a core biopsy, had suggested fibroadenoma, but probably these things can't really be confirmed 100% until you see the whole thing. I did read somewhere that fibroadenomas can become PT (though rarely). The surgeon said it's very good we removed it! She asked me just to keep an eye on the area and go for repeat screening as it can come back, especially as they did not leave a big surgical margin (only 5mm, probably because she thought it was just fibroadenoma). I am quite relieved. And relieved too that my suspicions about it being one lump, not two, were confirmed. Sometimes I really felt that I wasn't taken seriously by doctors regarding my concerns, probably because it wasn't cancer, and here I did actually have a problem.",
