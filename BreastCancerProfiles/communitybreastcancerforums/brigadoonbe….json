Sep 12, 2007 03:51AM Angelflight wrote: Hi ladies, I'm from the chemosabe march cruisers.  Finished my chemo about 10 weeks ago. (Taxotere, Adriamyacin, Cytoxin) or TAC.  Your questions and concerns are valid ones, but don't be so terrified.  I actually breezed through chemo with little side effects. Emend is not given too often these days although it's one of the newest of the chemo drugs for anti-nausea.  Most insurance companies will not cover the cost of it since it's the most expensive.  Decadron will do just as well and is covered in almost all cases. We were all terrified the first time in the chair, but I had no problems whatsoever.  Made a lot of nice friends there as well and we passed out jello and munchies to all the others around us.  We always had our own little party, and took an ice chest with lunch and drinks. You can get up and walk around and to and from the bathroom as well.  You just unplug and your pumps are battery operated too.  We even went outside sometimes for an hour or so. Take a blanket if you want to sleep although most centers have those as well. Here are a bunch of great tips and if you start on them right away you can curb some of the problems you'll encounter after chemo starts. Get started brushing your teeth with Biotene Toothpaste as well as using Biotene Mouthwash in place of your regular toothpaste.  It will keep you from getting the mouth sores so many before us have gotten.  If you do get mouth sores, have the onc write you a script for Magic Mouthwash.  I say prevention is worth a pound of cure. Stock up on Senekot.  The first few days after chemo you will usually be constipated.  If you just take one every night before bed you won't have a problem. Stock up on Emodium.  Usually after the constipation is over you will follow with diaharrea.  The Emodium will work wonders for most, but those who can't control it have your onc. give you a script for Lotrimin.  Also yogurt with active cultures is a big help. Just one a day is enough. Be prepared for your hair loss.  Most of us never knew that when the hair would start to thin it would hurt.  That's the time you want to do a final buzz.  Besides it keeps you from shedding like a dog everywhere you go. Most of us don't recommend wigs unless you absolutely have to have one.  They're scratchy, itchy and hot.  Scarves and cool hats are much more comfortable for going out.  Ebay is a good source for scarf lots if you need some. Be prepared for weight gain.  Yes I said weight gain.  The steroids you'll be taking for the anti-neasua will work wonders but not without it's price.  Expect anywhere from 20-50 lbs before chemo is over.  If you're one of the few who doesn't gain that consider yourself one of the lucky few. Expect lots and lots of sleepless nights.  Have the onc. write you a script for Ambien.  Most of you are probably already experiencing lack of sleep even before chemo; it just gets worse. Don't be afraid of all of the medications you'll be taking.  It doesn't last forever and all of them serve their purpose. Be prepared for metallic tasting drinks.  Some say flavored waters work well although one time it will and the next time something else will work better.  Drink at least 64oz of liquids per day if you possibly can.  It will help flush the chemo faster and you don't want to encounter bladder or kidney problems. That includes, jello and any liquids you drink, not just water. Don't be afraid of your port hurting when they insert into it for chemo.  I never had mine sprayed or used a cream and never had it hurt once.  The nurses are experts in doing it.  Some people complain they can see theirs more than other people.  Consider yourself lucky as they say the closer they are to the surface the less problems. Taxotere and Taxol are notorious for causing water retention or nails turning dark.  Never happened to me and some say they put their hands in ice water during chemo to prevent it.  It's your call. I can tell you this.  When I did my chemo I was petrified the first time.  But I only had a bad bout with diaharrea once until I found out the yogurt was my cure.  Other than that I had a little fatique once in a while and that was it.  Can't say that's what will happen to you, but know it's possible if you don't dwell on it all the time. Hope some of this will help you ladies. Good luck, Angel   I do have one question for anyone.  Does anyone here experience urgent need to urinate as a side-effect?  I am sure we all drink a lot of water but when I am standing (working around the house) I suddenly know that if I don't get to the bathroom right away I will not make it.  It doesn't happen when I am sitting or for some reason when I am out.  Weird I know but thought I would ask.  ",

Swissmiss -  Perhaps you are dealing with post-nasal drip.  I have read that we lose nose hairs as a part of the hair loss side effects.  Numerous have complained of a dripping nose and having to constantly dab with a tissue.  To my mind it wouldn't be a huge leap to having the mucus drip at the back of the throat.  It may be a response  by the parasympathetic nervous system or one of those other nervous systems.  I use a neti pot when I have a cold and I rarely get a runny nose or nasal congestion.  Might be worth a try. If you do it is important to use distilled or boiled and cooled water. I have two pots and clean one in dishwasher each day. (I should have more so I wouldn't have to remember so much.) Day #8 in the chair DONE!  Now on to the week's cycle.  Wading into the abyss. CHARGE!

We have all lost so much.  I wrote this poem right after I had my dmx and DIEP..  It expresses the losses I have felt and have to work through in unguarded moments -   Do you know me? Come here you say. Come across the expanse of sheet that never gets dirty and share my blanket. Come into my arms and let me hold you. Who are you asking? Are you asking me? I don\u2019t recognize me when I look in the mirror, when I dress, when I touch myself. I bind myself with the veil that keeps it all in. All the fear. All the unknown. All the changes I am getting to know. Will you know that it is me? Will you recognize the me that is part of the changes? The me that never changes? The me that you have known so intimately? Can you tell me if I am still there? When I make that journey across the white expanse and feel the familiar engulf the new me I begin to feel a little of the old me. The tears come and I wish to know for you, am I still there?  ",

I am sure a walk and a couple of accomplishments will make me feel better.  That is my goal. Thanks for listening. ",

We have a fun thing happening in our family tomorrow.  Our son, DIL and SuperGrandson live down the road.  They just bought two, that's two, Great Dane puppies.  We are all so excited.  Like having new babies come  home.  That will tide me over if I ever get to hold them ;-)    ",
