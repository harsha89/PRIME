This morning when I woke up my ribs hurt so bad and I can't get a deep breath. I still feel feverish, too. Is this out of the ordinary? I had a Zometa infusion when I was in the hospital a couple of months ago, but I was so sedated I remember nothing about it, so I don't know if I had these same symptoms or not.  I have read that you can't take aspirin with it, but can you take Tylenol? I am miserable. Even getting a little headache. Dx 1/1/2014, Stage IV, mets, ER+ Log in to post a reply",

Since I am doing better this evening I guess that's okay, but I couldn't imagine a doctor closing down his whole office, giving his nurse and secretaries the week off, and not having someone available to help his patients if need be. This is a small town, but I still can't imagine not having a backup doctor.",

I have spinal mets and have Zometa infusions each month, but the doctor told me my sciatic pain is caused from my herniated disks (I have three of them). I take Fentanyl 25 mcg patches (down from 75) and when the pain is bad I use Lidocaine patches on my bulging disk. It helps. Most of the time the Fentanyl takes care of the pain and I can walk and stand for longer periods of time. I have heard that Zometa can cause pain, too, but it also helps to alleviate spinal mets. I'm sorry for your pain. I know it's inconvenient. Oh, I also take Anacin once in a while and that takes the pain away. I don't like taking pain pills. Most of them make me sick. You should check into the mildest Fentanyl patches. Hope it gets better soon.",

Fortunately, my friends seem to understand what I'm going through. Since I have been bedridden there are so many things I would like to do, but I am just unable to do them. I am getting better, though. I try to stand up three times a day. Yesterday, I actually walked to the living room, a big victory for me.

The first thing I noticed with itching and burning. Broke out in blisters. Mine were painful for the first few days, but soon the pain subsided. After the blisters dried up and burst I had scabs that went away in about a month. I can remember I felt like I had the flu for a couple of days. My doctor gave me Prednisone (which I'm allergic to), so I never took anything for mine. I did use calamine lotion. I have heard that you can use any type of Listerine and even though it burns the first time, it takes the pain away for good. I didn't do that at the time, but I have heard it works. You can have shingles more than once, too. My Mom had them on her shoulder and back and was in terrible pain for three months (crying pain), but she didn't have any lasting nerve pain from it. I hope you can find something that will  help the itching and burning. Just do not scratch. It can be pretty miserable.",
