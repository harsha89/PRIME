In 1971 it was found to be a teratogen when given to pregnant women.  My mother took it before conception and through her pregnancy with me on the advice of her doctor in 1951.  A new study shows DES daughters as having a 2.5 fold increase in breast cancer after age 40.  All of this, the family history, and the fibrocystic breast disease tends to make a me a little paranoid, you know?  Anyway, enough about me.  I really appreciate all of your help and advice.  If anyone else has anything to add, please don't hesitate. Thanks again to all of you.  Be strong, and be safe.  I'll let you know what happens. Anne",

I have been weighing all my options, and think that going through with the procedure would alleviate most of the fear and this sense of impending doom that seems to follow me around.  Can anyone who's done this, let me know how it worked out for you? Thanks so much for listening.  I can research like mad on the internet, but somehow talking to someone who's already been there seems like a more intelligent and personal way to assess everything logically.  Bless you all.  Log in to post a reply",

I realize that I'm not in the same league as the rest of you on this site, as I've not been officially diagnosed.  I still have a choice.  There is nothing even remotely brave about anything I'm considering - it is in fact the 'no brainer' easy way out.  But I'm still terrified.  The really courageous souls are all the women and men whose stories fill this website.  The ones who never got to make a choice and were forced into this situation.  The sheer compassion and strength that flows from everyone here is just astounding.  Thank you once again for sharing such a personal part of your life.  I really appreciate it.  I wish you every happiness now and in the future.",
