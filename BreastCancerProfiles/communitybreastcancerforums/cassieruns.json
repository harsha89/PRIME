This may come across mean to some but I believe in tough love. Put yourself in your daughters positions. Would you want them to ignore such a problem? You need to grow up and face whatever it is. It's extremely selfish of you to do what you're doing to your family. So many of these ladies have tried to help you. Be gracious and accept their help. You avoid answering many questions and therefore many are thinking you are an imposter. Quit being such a drama queen and get some help. If not for yourself, then for your family.",
