What's really strange to me is that although I've asked, I still haven't gotten a straight answer about how large my DCIS was. I asked for a copy of my pathology report, but it is pretty much unintelligible to me in terms of determining measurements. I know that the cells were non-comedo. I think the margins were fairly large. But I also think the actual area of DCIS was larger than 5mm. Hmmmm.  I have an appointment on Tuesday to get things set up for the radiation. I've already signed the consent forms. But I'm just having these feelings of foreboding. I am on disability for narcolepsy and exhaustion has been a part of my daily life for years and years. It really scares me when I read about people having severe fatigue for months or even years after treatment. I can barely work part-time now. Plus the treatment is for my left breast, so I worry about my heart and lungs. Ohh, I hate having to make all these decisions. I realize I'm lucky that it's DCIS rather than invasive cancer, but this roller-coaster ride is crazy! Before my lumpectomy I was worried that I should be having a mastectomy, now I'm worried about overtreating.  Oh, well. Thanks for all the helpful feedback, and best of luck to you all.",

I started off rads with a cold and a cough, so when I continued to have trouble with those for a while I didn't worry about lung effects. But it has been three weeks, and every day I seem to be having that shortness of breath that comes with asthma, and an unproductive cough. I had fairly mild asthma prior to DX, but now I'm using my inhaler more than ever. The scary thing is that it doesn't seem to be working as well as it used to.  I haven't mentioned it to the doctor, because I've been thinking it was the cold. Also, I'm afraid of seeming like a hypochondriac! Does/did anyone have a worsening of their asthma during rads? If so, was it temporary? They are taking chest x-rays once a week, so I figure if there were anything really wrong (like fluid, etc.) they would see it.

The first few days were rough, because I had pain right away--just what you're describing. I was so worried. I thought, if I'm having this much pain after #1, what will it be like at #33? But it seems as though my body has adjusted to the treatments (bodies are pretty amazing!) and pain hasn't been as much of an issue. I seem to have more discomfort at the beginning of the week, then easier in the middle, then small discomfort toward the end. At the end of the weekend, I feel the pain has diminished and I'm ready for another week. And the pain I'm talking about isn't that bad. So, hope that helps you to relax a little. The first two days were the worst for me. On the second day, I even had pain in my ribs and back on that side. But I think the body adjusts, and maybe our stress levels go down as we get into the routine. Keep us posted on how you're doing. NancyD, did they do treatment on you today with the blisters?

      "Content": "Oct 22, 2008 11:58PM - edited Oct 23, 2008 12:04AM by redheadace1 Hey, there. So I went to see my oncologist Tuesday. Before I even met him, at the beginning of all this, I heard people rave about him. One woman told me, \"He is a saint.\" Well, after Tuesday, I'm inclined to agree. Even though he was running an hour and a half behind, it was ok, because he and his assistant spent at least an hour with me! I went in with a whole long list of questions and concerns about the Tamoxifen, and my boss (who is an MD) went with me for support. Just in case any of you is dealing with any of these issues, here were the things I asked about, and what he said: Concerns about Tamoxifen: I have a huge fibroid that may or may not need to be surgically removed. I asked whether the Tamox would make it grow. He told me that Tamox does not make fibroids grow, but that they can appear to be larger because the tissue that surrounds them sometimes thickens. I have vasculitis in my legs; I was worried about clotting. He said that clotting is more of an issue for older patients. I have severe depression and am reluctant to go off Wellbutrin.  He said that Wellbutrin might interfere with the Tamox, so I'd probably have to switch to Effexor. I have a lot of testosterone. He said the Tamox would have no effect on that. I have narcolepsy and severe fatigue. In fact, I'm on disability because of it. The fatigue will definitely be an issue with the Tamox. I also have a tendency toward high blood sugar and high cholesterol. He said the Tamox would not effect my blood sugar, and that it probably would improve my cholesterol. He discussed all of this patiently with me, admitting when he didn't know something (so rare for a doc to do that), and checking into things for me. Ultimately, he was concerned about the possibility of mood change and the fatigue. He told me he thought I could manage it if I was closely monitored. You all can see what a physical wreck I am! So many issues to consider.  After we discussed all this, I asked him if he thought I should take the Tamoxifen. He told me that quality of life issues are very important, and that since I had a very low grade, small DCIS that was completely removed with lumpectomy, he wouldn't push me to take the Tamox. However, I have enough of a family history that we decided to do the BRACA testing. If the results come back positive (which I doubt they will), he will want me to take the Tamox. If not, it's up to me. We're not sure that the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks in that case.  So, assuming the test comes back negative, I could conceivably choose not to take the Tamoxifen. The problem is this: I'm the type of person who, if I don't take the Tamoxifen and have a recurrence, will pound my head on the wall and berate myself for not taking the damn stuff! Argghh. What do you all think? I think what I might end up doing is checking into a low dose of Tamox, if I can (someone posted a study about lower doses being just as effective, but I forgot to ask the doc about that). Then just see how I do. If things get rough, I can always quit, right?  Anyway, I have a month till the BRACA test comes back and I see him again. He says there's no reason to rush the decision. So I guess I'll just read and think and listen to what the people on this board have to say. I'm probably going to put this post on the general DCIS board as well, to see what kind of feedback I'll get. So many decisions to make! I'm glad to be done with rads, though. But my breast has been hurting more since I finished. Really sharp pains. Anyone else having this? V--I'm glad to hear you're doing so well. Sorry for the long post! Hope everyone has a great finish to the week. Thanks, Ace  P.S. I thought this was encouraging: He told me that in the near-decade he'd been practicing here, no one had died of a blood clot or contracted uterine cancer as a result of the Tamox. ",

I just heard from one of my college profs and he said he's known several people who had to take it and they did fine. And I've been hearing that from other women on the boards. It's a tough decision. Maybe you could just do a trial run and see how you do. I think that's what I'll end up doing. You might want to check out the feedback I got on my DCIS thread, \"Skip Tamoxifen?.\"",

Congratulations to you and Nancy 258 and all of the other girls who have finished. I'm doing well except for occasional stabbing pains in the ol' boob. My energy seems to be coming back. I need to go back and read over what's been happening with you all. I've discovered a new obsession: cooking! I was so intimidated by it before, and now I love it. It's so calming and I really enjoy the sensation of doing something healthy and loving for myself (or my friends--so far none of them have died from my efforts!) Hope everyone has a spooky weekend. We will light up the night with our glow-in-the-dark boobs! ",

I had quite a bit of discomfort Thursday night (my third treatment) and was worried, but yesterday and today have been fine. When I thought back, I realized that on Thursday I forgot to put the Biafine on after treatment. Also, I realized that I do much better with a snug-fitting bra, because otherwise my nipple rubs and gets really tender.  Last night my girlfriends and I went out to a festival and got temporary tattoos. It was a nice, fun thing to do for myself. Mary, welcome to the group. Keep us posted on how you're doing. I'll tell you one thing, those of you who do chemo and then do rads are my personal heroes. And those of you who have mx then chemo and rads, well...your strength amazes me. Here's to a relaxing weekend. Cheers, Ace ",

Please don't feel guilty! I didn't have a mastectomy or chemo, and it's still been hard for me, anxiety and energy-wise. Texan--My CT appointment took about a half-hour to 45 min. I then had another appointment that took a while because they did several xrays and marked me up all over (again--they'd done that at the CT appointment) and wrote on me for quite a while, lining the machine up exactly. Then they did the first treatment. After that, they tattooed me and wiped off the other marks as best they could. That appointment took about an hour and 15 minutes. I think some people get their tattoos or marks sometime before the first treatment in a separate visit. But I got mine the same day I had the first zap. Hope all goes well for you.  I also wanted to mention to everyone that I found some aloe gel that has only 3 ingredients: aloe, sodium carbamer, and methyl parabens. It's called George's Always Active Aloe, and I got it at the health-food store. The website is www.georgesaloe.com Cheers!   ",

Orli--Welcome. I DEFINITELY felt the first treatment, although I didn't notice a smell. I know I've read about other people noticing that smell, though. I think the first couple of treatments were hard and painful, but then the body seems to adjust. EmilyJane--Yay! I hope your boosts go well. I know what you mean about getting your privacy back. I don't have the ink issue too much, as I have the permanent tattoos. Roberta--I hope you can relax a bit this weekend and get your mind off things. I know how hard that is, though. Keep us posted on the ovary situation. I will be sending you good thoughts. I wanted to tell you all about something really sweet my boss did for me. He drew a big flower on a large piece of paper and divided the petals, stem, etc. into 33 sections. Every day after treatment I color in another section. It's a nice little ritual--kind of like an Advent calendar. He was really embarrassed when I pointed out that the center of the flower looks exactly like a breast! But I guess I've got breasts on the brain . Hope we all have a restful time this weekend with our family and friends. And Sharon, I hope you get a chance to get in touch with the folks back home, and ease your homesickness.  Best, Ace ",

I had a cold when I started rads, and it's definitely an energy sapper.   Susan--I was scared about rads, too. Thought I would really burn, as I am a redhead. But my skin never broke. It just got really red and my nipple was sore. I guess skin tone isn't really a predictor of how we do.   Nancy258--Hope your boosts go well. I found them to be a little tougher, painwise, but then again maybe that's just because of the cumulative effects of the rads.   Sharon--I feel for you, missing your family and all. I don't know if I would have been able to handle it without my family and friends. You're doing an amazing job!   Princess--I'm so excited for you! Tuesday! Can you believe it? You know, all the techs and my friends kept saying how fast my treatments went. Not for me! It seemed like forever.   Roberta--I was using aloe leaf that I kept in the fridge. It was very soothing. I never tried putting my regular cream in the fridge.    Kristy--Hurray! Congrats on being 2/3 through!   Midsumm--Enjoy your time at the spa. That sounds dreamy. And you are my personal hero for doing such physical feats during rads. I was pretty much a lump (still am).   Rose--Congratulations! I know what you mean about the happy/sad thing. I feel a little melancholy today, after the high of finishing yesterday. I'm worried about the choices that still lie ahead--like the Tamox and possible hysterectomy. But I'm trying to just enjoy being done. Slept in today; that was nice. Keep us posted on how you are, ok?   Holly--Woohoo! So glad you're done!   Dancemom--Have fun at the wedding!   Kathi--Great picture! Our boobs will light the way to a better world!   PattyK--Hope you feel better over the weekend. Have you tried Ibuprofen for the pain? That helped me a little on my bad days.   Janloy--Don't feel guilty. I see from your picture that you have your hands full. I didn't have chemo, and I don't have kids, and rads were still really hard for me. And as for driving 40 minutes--if I'd had to do that every day, I'd be completely exhausted. I spent the whole time thanking God that I'm only 15 minutes away from the cancer center. Be good to yourself (I command thee! :>).   Thanks for the congratulatory wishes, everyone. I had a good morning yesterday.  A friend met me outside the cancer center and gave me a present, then helped me carry in the cake I brought to thank the rad team. Then I went to my favorite cafe and met a few more friends. Got some flowers and hugs. I'll do my real celebrating on Sunday.  A friend is having a little party for me. I'm spoiled! One of the best things, though, was that my Mom told me she was proud of me. That meant a lot. I have a history of not handling things real well, of breaking down too easily, but I saw through this ordeal how much stronger I've become over the years. It was nice to have it validated.    I think we're all pretty amazing!",

      "Content": "Oct 20, 2008 04:29PM - edited Oct 20, 2008 04:30PM by redheadace1 Hi, girls. I knew I could count on you to be supportive and understanding. I feel a bit better today. I had a little gathering with a few of my friends last night, and they brought me healthy food to take home. I got a big bulb of fennel, which my friend Nancy says is really good to eat to recover from radiation. So I chopped that up and have been munching on it.   Makraz--I can understand your anxiety about your kids. I think it would probably be infinitely harder to deal with this disease if I knew there was a possibility of missing out on my children's lives. But I guess we have to remember that the prognosis for BC is much better than it has been in the past. How old are your guys?   Susan--I don't know if my cancer center has a counselor, but I'm actually going to put a call in to this counselor who was recommended to me by my doctor. I think it will help to have someone to talk to over the next few months--to be able to talk freely, and not be concerned about worrying friends or family with my fears. As far as the Wellbutrin goes, from what I've read, some practitioners think it interferes with the Tamox. I was on Celexa before, and it was working (not as well as the Wellbutrin), and I guess I could switch back to that if I had to. It's compatible with Tamoxifen.    NancyD--I can relate to what you said about no one person knowing the whole of what you've been through. It's true. And know one knows what it feels like from the inside. I'm sure the empty nest thing will be bittersweet, but hopefully you can take some comfort that you did a good job raising your kids, and they will be there for you later, even if they're not living with you.  I hope you're healing up from the rads.   Kristy--I'm glad you got a chance to get some comfort. It does feel good to just get a hug now and then, with no advice or verbal reassurances or cheery platitudes.   Kathi--I guess you and I will be talking more about the antidepressant/Tamox transition. I'm sorry to hear that you had such a hard time with your mom. It must have been rough--a lot of inconsistency and uncertainty. I had some of that with my dad.   Rose--I hope you'll be feeling better soon.   Midsum and Nancy258--Thank you.   Thank you all so much to for the hugs and well-wishes. I don't know what I would have done without this group. It's clear that we need to be able to talk to others who have been where we've been, to get some real understanding. I am sending you all hugs in return. I'm hoping we'll all keep in touch over the months as we deal with Tamoxifen and other things.   I have my oncology appointment tomorrow. I'm armed with plenty of questions about the Tamox. I'll let you know how it goes.   Hugs to you all,   Ace    ",

I said, \"Maybe it's just my imagination,\" and he said, \"I'm sure it's not your imagination.\" I was stunned. I've had a lot of bad doctors during my lifetime, very dismissive. So I was prepared for the same with him. He suggested it might be muscle pain (I don't think it is), but he also said that many of his patients experience a sensation of heat from the very first treatment. And he just reassured me that he would be keeping a close eye on things. I was so relieved that I bawled in the parking lot for five minutes afterwards. Not sure where all those tears came from! Sheesh.  Kristy--good luck with everything. I'm using a prescription cream, Biafine, and no deodorant for me on the left side for another month or so --not even Tom's of Maine or a deodorant crystal. People will be giving me a wide berth! I had a bath this a.m. before my tx at 9:30 and by the time I drove over in the 85 degree heat I was a bit smelly. I apologized to the rad team. Oh well.

I was feeling pretty sore, but then my boss (who is an MD) gave me some pure calendula gel to put on my breast. I was a little reluctant, afraid it would interfere with rads, so I decided to just use it on the weekend. It helped SO MUCH after just one application. I was amazed. So I feel ready to tackle another nine treatments. Had to do a little bit of an attitude adjustment this weekend--had to fight down some anger and \"Why me\"s, but I think a lot of it was just pure fatigue. I felt like a fussy infant! Just needed to sleep it off.  Here's to a good week for all of us! ",

The rad onc thinks I need to because I'm only 44 and have a longer time to be at risk.  I guess a lot of us will be keeping in touch with each other on the hormonal therapy boards. ",

When she told me about my DCIS, it was like my mind just went to some kind of blank place. I wasn't really hearing. And it didn't sink in until I started researching options. Waiting is so, so hard. I, and a lot of other women on this board, found it to be one of the hardest things. The unknown is so....unknown; when we don't know what we're up against, it's hard to know how to fight. Sometimes getting a treatment plan down, and starting treatment, can actually help with the fear or numbness. You're so young to have to deal with this. I'm sorry. I will definitely have you in my thoughts and prayers over the next few weeks. I'm glad you have some good support. I was fortunate enough to have my boss (an MD) and my close friend (an ER nurse) with me during some of the tough meetings. As far as having more kids, I can't see why not. But I don't have kids, so I'm not really in the know about that. But knowing what I know now about breast cancer and the amazing treatments that are available, I'm optimistic that you'll see your son grow up. The day I had my onc appointment, a woman from Reach to Recovery came in and gave me a big bag of freebies and literature. She is a Stage IV survivor, and she is so vibrant and alive and healthy. It was so comforting to see someone who had been to that place and was back and thriving. So keep your hope. In the meantime, you will find support on this board that you won't find anywhere else (except maybe a real-time BC support group). You won't be alone in the trials and decisions and (believe it or not) joys that are ahead of you. Keep us posted on how things go Monday. Ace ",

I want to take my nipple off and stick it in a drawer somewhere until this is over. This is one time when having sensitive nipples isn't a plus ;).  So, I had this funny thought yesterday when I was getting my x-rays. Right before they do the x-ray, I can look up and see a perfect shadow of my breast on the machine panel next to me. Does everyone know what I'm talking about? For some reason I get giddy and embarrassed when this happens. It's like actually seeing that shadow reminds me that I'm lying there half naked--whereas when I'm just lying on the table looking up at the ceiling I can sort of forget about my breasts. Anyway, this time that Cat Stevens song, \"Moon Shadow,\" came into my head and I starting thinking \"Boob shadow...I'm being followed by a boob shadow----boob shadow,  boob shadow.\" I felt as if I were on the verge of uncontrollable giggles, but I managed to control it. Jeez. The crazy things that go through my head when I'm lying on that table....!  Hope everyone's Friday is great, and here's to a restful weekend. Cheers, Ace ",

I was at a party last night and one of my friends said, \"I'm so glad it's all over. I was so scared.\" But it's NOT all over. Now there's the Tamox and the worrying and the possible surgery on my uterus. And I'm going through this terrible baby-ache. I was sick for years after I graduated from college (undiagnosed narcolepsy and severe depression) and I just never got to a place where I was healthy enough to have kids. And I love them so. I'm very maternal. Now I'm 44, single, and I'm starting to really KNOW it. I'm not going to have them. I probably couldn't handle them even if I did have them, because I'm so exhausted all the time.  I've been working part-time as a nanny with the same little boy since he was 1 year old. His mom is one of my best friends. I used to get down next to her belly and talk to him when she was pregnant. He's 7 now. He's the love of my life. But I'm not his mother. And he's getting older and soon won't need me anymore.  I'm just so scared. I've had health problems all my life and I never caught up. I never had a real \"career,\" because I was sick for so long after school. I don't know what kind of work I'll be able to do with the narcolepsy. I'm broke. And now every twinge in my radiated breast reminds me that I had cancer. That it could come back. I don't want to flunk this \"test.\" You know, the trials of adversity. I want to emerge from this experience stronger and more positive and with healthier habits. And sometimes I feel that I have. But not today. I'm worried that I'll keep not exercising enough and that I'll keep eating things that are bad for me and I'll keep living in fear, and the cancer will come back, and it will be my fault. My friends keep saying how well I've handled this, how strong I've become. They are my lifeline. But they're not in this body, with this brain. And it's so hard to go through all of this without a mate. When I was younger I had several chances to marry, but I wasn't healthy enough emotionally. Since the breast surgery and the possibility of upcoming surgery on my uterus, I'm holding any interested men away. My femininity and sexuality feel so compromised. I hope this isn't too much. I needed to talk to somebody. If I ever try to talk to my friends about still being scared, I know they will say \"You will be ok.\" Or \"You have to think positively.\" They say that partly because they so want me to be ok. And I don't want to worry or scare them. I thought it might be better to talk to you all, to just get it out in writing. Can anyone else relate to what I'm saying? I'm worried about the whole Tamox question. To take it or not? I guess I'll have to go off my Wellbutrin (from what I've read). I have pretty severe depression, and Wellbutrin has been like a Godsend. Oh, brother. I'm sorry for dumping. You all have been so supportive throughout this whole thing. I wish there was a way we could all get together in real life. You're all strong and positive and supportive. I'm proud to know you.  Thanks for listening. Ace ",

My best friend is waiting for biopsy results and is convinced that the news will be bad. I'm worried, too. The thing is, she has a tendency to self blame that, in its intensity, is enough to cause serious psychological damage. She is already starting to talk about how she deserves to have cancer. She is overweight and rather sedentary, and her diet is not great, because she has very little money for food. So she says that because of this, it is all her fault if she has cancer. This self-blame and terror she is experiencing has a lot to do with trauma she experienced as a child, and also from having to watch her 30-year-old husband die a slow and horrible death from metastatic brain cancer. She has an intense case of survivor guilt, and because of this she has never treated herself well or taken very good care of herself. She is getting triggered all over the place having to deal with the possibility of cancer. I was wondering if any of you have any advice on what I could say to her to convince her that she is not to blame. I just read a statistic that said that 70% of breast cancers occur in women whose only known risk is age. That kind of thing is good, because it's a \"fact.\" I think that statistics and facts would help me convince her that she should not blame herself. Also, you might have dealt with the self-blame and found a way to help yourself through it. She has had such a difficult life so far. It shreds my heart to see her headed down this dark path of self-loathing.  I had DCIS in 2008, and this community helped me so much. I am so grateful, and I would be very thankful of anything  you might have to say, Blessings, Candace Dx 6/08, DCIS stage 0, Grade 1, ER/PR+, 0/0 nodes, lumpectomy 7/24/08, finished rads 10/16, thinking about Tamoxifen Log in to post a reply",
