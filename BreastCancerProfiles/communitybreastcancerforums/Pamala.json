Hearing about these female celebrities who are choosing to have DMs, regardless of the diagnosis, is freaking me out! From what I read, Amy Robach doesn't even know what type of bc she has yet--and she's deciding on her treatment?! Of course, I'm assuming that because these women are celebrities, they're seeing some of the best doctors, which makes me worry that DM *is* the best option and something I should have done! Feeling anxious yet again!",
