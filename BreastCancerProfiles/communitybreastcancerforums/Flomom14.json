Then a year later, I felt a lump while visiting our freshman daughter at college, and was diagnosed wit breast cancer again. Started chemotherapy on December 1, 2016 with A/C every 2 weeks and just finished that round on January 15, 2017. Lost my hair on December 18, 2016 15 days after my first treatment and 2 days after my second A/C. Just started Taxol on January 26, 2016 and have 11 more weeks to go. Personally, I just really want my hair back - having a hard time with the hair loss. Still have my eyebrows and lashes but was told that may be temporary. My main problem after my last A/C and my recent Taxol is my eyes won't stop tearing, I just have drops flowing out of them which is making my eyes red, crusty and sore - has anyone had that problem while on chemo? If all goes well, I will finish Taxol mid April and will have my bilateral mastectomy in May/June. I am also an elementary school teacher and have been working through all of this, just missing a day a week for chemo now with Taxol - will see how long I can make it because the chemo fatigue is a lot to deal with as an elementary teacher, at least for me",

First week of May was a blur between pain meds, discomfort and sleeping. Worst part was opiod induced constipation due to anesthesia and pain meds - stopped pain meds immediately after that low point. Question for anyone who has had the BMX yet, I am numb from my right elbow to my left armpit. It feels like I have an elephant sitting on my chest due to the expanders. I had 4 drains, 2 removed last week and I am hoping for the rest this week; however, has anyone had swelling and how long will the swelling last? And has anyone had discomfort with the expanders, it feels like I have two boulders in my chest and haven't even begun the saline filling yet I was also fitted for my surgical corset/bra before surgery and would advise sizing up with one then go regular with another, I was so swollen after my surgery that when I left the hospital, I could not get the surgical bra on at all. Other than exhaustion and I still have one t-rex arm on my right side, I am doing pretty good going into week 2 post surgery.",

I was Stage 1 ERPR+ Her2Neg in right breast in 2015; had lumpectomy and radiation. Finished radiation October 1, 2015. Rediagnosed with breast cancer, same spot known as a local recurrence, on October 1. 2016. Finished 16 rounds of chemo on April 10th - AC then Taxol. I do not have the BRCA gene. Having a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction - very nervous about what it's going to look like when I wake up. My hair started coming back, so now it looks like I have a receding hairline versus being bald. I may need radiation again in my neck/clavicle for hard to reach lymph nodes since my breast cancer spread a little - but trying to negotiate out of that and they won't know until I have my lab results. Thanks for starting this thread - and my insurance covered 2 zippered camisoles with drain pockets which is what I got for after surgery. Is anyone packing anything in particular for their hospital stay? As long as I can type, I will let you all know how it goes..",

However, my hair is coming back on my sides and back, but my top has hair with some bald spots. Will all of my hair come back, or am I also going to have a receding hair line to deal with. Fighting breast cancer for a second time and now I fear being permanently bald, boobless and worrying about having a tree trunk for an arm. But right now, the vain person in me just wants hair and it to come back evenly, which it isn't. Not to mention my hair is really gray - I am curious to know if the gray is permanent because I was brown before the chemo",
