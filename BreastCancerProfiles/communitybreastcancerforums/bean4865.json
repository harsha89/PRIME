I just had a biopsy done the other day by my obgyn because of the tamoxofin. He said you are at risk of developing uterine cancer on tamox. Has anyone had this happen? I'm a little nervous waiting for results. Thanks,  Bean4865 Kathleen Browning Dx 10/25/2007, ILC, 2cm, Grade 1, 0/17 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Had some issues during the night with major heartburn but am taking pepcid now. My question is when will the big side effects start? I feel like a sitting duck just waiting. I've heard that the first few days are not too bad but around day 3 it hits. So I guess maybe tommorrow. I am dreading it. I see alot of people who say TC is doable. I am a sitting duck. I know everyone is different but if you could just give me some insight of your experiences I would appreciate it. P.S I am drinking water like crazy as I have heard this is very helpful. Kathleen Browning Dx 10/25/2007, ILC, 2cm, Grade 1, 0/17 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "bean4865 wrote: I wonder if anyone can help. I have been wearing my wig for 3 months now. I have gotten alot of compliments on it. In the beginning some people thought it was my real hair. It does look alot like my hair, but the problem is it is starting to look ratty. The top and sides are fine but where it rubs against my clothing in the back of my neck it is a mess. It just looks like friz. When I look up and then put my head back down the hair stays up in the air. I hope this isn't to confusing. I am starting to get real self concious about this. Does anyone have any suggestions. My friend told me to maybe have it trimmed. I don't know what to do. It was not a cheap wig either. I never expected this.
