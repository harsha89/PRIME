Never even knew there was this catheter treatment..like MHP70, am doing it the old-fashioned way, on my back, right hand up, for 33 sessions.Will be asking the onc. about it though about the facing down position as it seems to reduce toxicity. Did anyone have a sort of a heavy ache in and around the breast after the CTscan and tattoos? Please keep us posted on this and Pomegranate,please convey my good wishes to your sis.",

I just came back from my first rad..not bad, was quite scared though of the unknown.Anyway i did ask the onc about the thyroid shield and he looked puzzled, then explained that the rad would be done at particular angles so it really would just affect the breast and not the lungs or thyroid etc.The whole process took about 20 minutes,as they had to take pics and do some more measurements. Joan, it does feel so emotional,for some reason I felt like bursting into tears when the onc started with his briefing.BTW, he also said that the fatigue would probably hit me after the 2nd week of rads. 1 down, 32 more to go!!",

I see the doctor on Tuesday, just hope there is no infection--the skin  affected is mostly under the arm and under the breast.

Since my boosts started after rad 25, the area has had some time to heal, and it's getting better, so hang in there....there is hope at the end of the rad tunnel. I have been asked to see the oncologist on 23rd Feb, that is almost 3 months after my last rad.I wonder if this is part of the Canadian protocol? Good luck to all of you, can't believe will be done with the rad in just 2 more days.",
