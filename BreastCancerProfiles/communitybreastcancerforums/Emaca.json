I had a call back from a routine mammo for more views and ultra sound and the radiologist came in after viewing films and spoke to me. He then took another looks on screen for live view and gave me his input. Final results came from my Dr. a few days later where she was more comfortable with me seeing a breast surgeon. Good luck, Hope you get good news quickly. ",

I was there at 7 am...in preop I had my IV then a little sedation, I could not focus so I closed my eyes and asleep I was. I remember waking up in recovery for a quick bit but kept dozing. Then I went to step down and they let me sleep more, but they started getting me up. I was home a little after 130. My incision is about 2 inches and they painted on an adheasive dressing that is water proof. I spent the day in bed. Ice and sleep! Been drinking and had a few crackers about 4 and white elbow macaroni for dinner. Back to bed at 8! Have not needed any pain meds (yet) hopefully stays that way. If I may say so, this was easier than the core needle biopsy (did not like the sound of the pulling biopsy unit) I was good being asleep! Keep us posted tpappwill23 ",

I assume you will be followed a little closer. Good luck ",
