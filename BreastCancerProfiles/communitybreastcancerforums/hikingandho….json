You go, girl! These are THE most supportive ladies I know - we've all walked the road - most of us were inexperienced about the process and yet every time we asked for help, there were others who responded who knew the next steps. I'm so proud of you for looking us up and that you found your voice (I concur about your PA). You have every right to ask and to ask again if you didn't understand. Remember, the health professionals are working for YOU - they are hired BY you to take care of YOU. That's their job. You are not hired by them to be their patient. If they are not doing their job to your satisfaction, you need to be able to state your needs. Wishing you fatty benign tumors - Stacy",

Your hormones are really kicking it up at your age and you may start to have cyclic breast changes coinciding with your period. I did at your age - painful lumps in my breast or under my arms that went away when my period started. As a mom of an 18 yr old girl - I would tell her I was proud that she knew her body enough to recognize a change. Then I would ask her where she was in her period. If her period had started and the lump still wasn't resolving, then I would strongly recommend a visit to the doctor just to double check. Either way, a doctor will be able to talk to you about what's happening to your body and find ways of possibly dealing with it. Good luck to you and I'm so glad you asked someone - even a virtual community - for help!",

Nights and mornings are the worst - everything hurts just to move but, once I get up and move around getting my day started, it fades. However, if I sit driving for awhile or sit at home for awhile, I feel like the tin man needing oil. I'm a very active person and am a contractor (home maintenance and repair). I have neuropathy in my hands and feet -my feet feel like blocks of wood. My hands feel like I have gloves on. All of that is a chemo left-over. My Onc and I discuss this every time I go in and we evaluate what we're doing each time. I'm now on Exemestane which has a the SE of joint pain. If it gets to be too much, I'll switch to Tamoxifen. The joint pain and neuropathy was supposed to go away after chemo/radiation but there is a possibility it won't. ",
