    "Content": "Piperdad wrote: My wife was diagnosed in late 2009 with Stage III-B squamous cell breast cancer.  Carboplatin (chemo) reduced the tumor significantly, and she had a mastectomy follwed by radiation and more chemo.  Two months ago a PET-scan identified a single, small (11 cm) nodule in her lung.  She had lung surgery last week, and the surgeon identified the tumor as a squamous cell.  We won't know for sure until next week, but it quite likely that this is a metastatic process and not a primary lung cancer.  She is home recovering.  My wife is otherwise healthy, 57 years old, and generally quite upbeat.  Obviously this unexpected setback is upsetting for both of us.  I would love to share with her success stories of anyone out there who has survived this disease long-term.      Log in to post a reply",
