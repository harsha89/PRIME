      "Content": "Feb 7, 2017 02:53PM theresa45 wrote: I recently (Nov 2016) completed proton radiation therapy to nodes in my neck, axillary and a node in my chest, all on my left side. My nodes lit up on PET/CT, but none were \"pathologically enlarged\" (largest was 1.2cm). I had a biopsy of the chest node (hilar node) which confirmed breast cancer. I had esophagitis (trouble swallowing due to radiation) that lasted about 10 days in the middle of my 6 weeks of treatments. My esophagitis was very tolerable and temporary. I have some swelling above my collarbone as a result of the radiation therapy, but I also had 5 neck nodes surgically removed which put me at a greater risk for lymphedema. The lymphedema is minimal now, but I'm concerned that it will become worse. I have not had a post radiation PET/CT scan because my doctors want me to wait 4 months for inflammation from the radiation to clear. My radiation oncologist is optimistic that the cancer in my nodes will be eliminated, but who know what the scan will reveal outside of the radiation fields. My oncologist believes that radiation to cancerous nodes can extend survival in Stage IV patients who have limited or no other metastatic lesions in other locations. This is not standard of care. Not all proton centers will treat Stage IV patients and not all insurance plans will cover it. Some proton centers will cover or discount the cost of proton therapy when insurance companies stall or refuse to pay. I was treated by Dr Giap at Scripps Proton Center in San Diego, CA. Dr Giap is a dedicated, caring physician. In the end, my insurance company covered my treatment, although Scripps may have taken a discounted rate. The radiation choice is a very personal decision. Side effects and benefits vary between patients, and there are no guarantees. Thanks to the responders here, you will be aware of the potential side effects. Overall, I feel lucky to have had access to proton therapy, but I'm still leery about other long term consequences that might arise. I would want your doctors to explain why they think that the risk/benefit balance is favorable for your situation. Your tumor load seems to be low (yeah!). However, you seem to have already used many of the hormonal treatments and your cancer is now PR-. This may be why your doctors believe that radiation is a worthwhile risk. I also would look into proton therapy to minimize damage to surrounding tissue. Best wishes and I sincerely hope my information helps you! Theresa",

Mild-fdg uptake means that the lung nodule showed low FDG uptake. Higher FDG uptake increases the probability that the nodule is cancer. Also the higher the FDG uptake, the faster the cancer may be growing. Subcentimeter nodules are smaller than a centimeter and often considered \"too small to characterize by PET/CT.\" That means, cancer can't be confirmed. So, small and mild FDG uptake are good signs! Mediastinal nodes with FDG uptake often accompany lung mets. If your mom does not have mediastinal nodes lighting up on PET/CT that's also a good sign. Given your mom's previous breast cancer diagnosis, the nodules may be lung mets and should be followed closely. The only ways to confirm lung mets are biopsy or growth seen on a follow-up PET/CT or CT with contrast. And as someone else mentioned, if the lung nodules don't change on scans for two years, they are considered benign. I'm sorry that your mother is in this scary position. She is lucky to have a loving daughter to assist her!! Best wishes! Theresa",

The proton therapy center was associated with Scripps at the time and is now called California Protons Cancer Therapy Center. All my lymph nodes except one stubborn axillary node have remained inactive. I had an excellent experience. The radiation oncologist who treated me has relocated. I know santabarbarian (not stage IV) recently had proton therapy for left-side breast cancer in New Jersey. Many proton centers don't want to treat Stage IV patients. The Loma Linda Proton Center would not treat me. Insurance companies are reluctant to pay for proton radiation. In the end, my proton therapy was covered after the proton center lawyers went back and forth with my insurance. At the time, my husband was consulting and had the best-available Covered California plan. A company-based insurance policy should be better. Hugs! Theresa",

I live in Northern California and was treated in San Diego at Scripps Proton Center. The center has since changed names/ownership. None of my treated lymph nodes have shown activity on PET/CT since proton therapy treatment. After some initial battling with insurance, my insurance covered my treatment. Toward the end of my 6 week treatment, I had some skin burns. I also experienced esophagitis (difficulty swallowing) for a week or so. Finally I developed some very minimal lymphedema in my left arm about 4 months after treatment. I feel fortunate to have had access to proton radiation therapy and consider the treatment a success. If I remember right, we looked at the Procure Center associated with MSK at the time, but since I was newly diagnosed with Stage IV, I was not eligible for proton therapy with them. I wish you much success in your treatment! Theresa",

Over time breast cancer can become resistant to hormonal treatments, even though they might still be ER+ on a biopsy. Since you have already taken letrozole and anastrozole, your cancer may be resistant to those AIs. Your oncologist may consider changing you to Ibrance with Faslodex (SERD given by injection). Exemestane is also a possible hormone therapy with or without Afinitor. Due to the size of the liver met, your oncologist may want to try Xeloda (pill chemo) or an IV chemo. I'm currently on Xeloda and feel well, although I do have sore feet from hand/foot syndrome. If one of the systemic treatments can shrink your liver tumors, then a local liver treatment like Y90 or RFA could be used. I just want you to know that there are many options available after Ibrance/Faslodex fails. Theresa",
