A nurse told me that the way you feel during and after the first treatment is the way you will feel for all of them. Are you finding that is true? I have heard so many stories that one week can be great then the next one you are in bed for a week unable to function. I worked in an elementary school as well as my home childcare business for the past 14 years. My MO told me first thing that with a compromised immune system I absolutely should not be in the germ factory of school. I had to resign that job because of this so now all I have is my childcare business with 6 school age kids 3 hours a day. I am already a germ freak in my own house and they are already in the habit of washing their hands before they do anything else when we get home. I asked about the whole Benadryl thing today and it didn't sound like I had any option but to get the super dose very quickly and then just be out of it. I'll have to ask if they can spread out the time in which it is given. My infusions will be on Friday as well for the same reason as you. The thing is I will take kids to school go to treatment and be home in time to pick them up after school. Really concerned I cannot drive after all that Benadryl. How long does it hang on? Maybe drinking a lot of water will get rid of the effects sooner? I do have help with the kids on Monday as I was told I may not feel like doing anything then. That is a horrifying thought to me. I am used to working at least 50 hours a week and the thought of not being able to even function is pretty scary to me. I have to have AC first. I hear that is bad! I have heard varying stories on the Taxol, which I will have after the AC.",

I will go first thing in the morning but will need to be done by 2 so I can work from 2:30 till 5:30. Weekends will hopefully be enough to recover and I may have a little help on Monday for work. I already told doctor that if I have to do chemo (basically they are saying I have no other choice) then it will have to be on MY terms, which will be Friday. I'm concerned about driving. I may have to take myself back and forth to treatments because husband can't always be off work. I've heard drinking lots of water helps and I normally do that anyway. Are we talking like gallons of water, because I don't do that. If side effects last past Monday then I am in big trouble as far as work. I have a child care business in my home. I have 6 kids in my care, all of them in school full days. I have them for a while in the morning, have to take them to school, then I am free until about 2:15 when I have to start picking them up again, then keep them until 5:30. Does this sound doable? I am not sure which chemo meds I will be getting. Will find out this morning but regardless I am scared to death of how this is going to affect my daily routine. I had to resign from my other part time job I normally did when kids were in school to leave time for appointments and rest. I have worked too long and too hard to build my business over the years and if I start missing a bunch of work, I will lose that too. I appreciate you input. Thank you!",

My first of 4 AC infusions is next Friday. I have no idea what to expect. I was told how you react to the first one will be how you react to the rest, yet I am reading here that side effects get worse and last longer after each one. I don't even know what to believe anymore. I'm shaking in my boots and know that when I walk into the chemo center next week I am going to want to turn and run the other way. I sound like a broken record here because I have expressed all this before, but the reality hit me really hard last night. And the worst part is in 3 weeks I will have a bald head!

Kind of like \"who, me????\" I was talking to someone on the phone yesterday who went through this in her late 40's, the same exact chemo as me. I was really questioning her about her side effects, etc. She said the worst she had was there was one day she didn't \"look good\". Hopefully that good result came from being part of the younger crowd. If I could only be so lucky. I am fearing the worst. Thanks for the smile this morning!",

I went to chemo class today and left a bigger mess than I went in. For 2 hours all I heard was that I can plan on being very very sick for the next 5 months and of all the side effects I WILL get, not that I COULD get. I was told to basically plan for the worst of everything. Being so tired I can't function, lots of weight gain, major blood count problems, nausea that may not be controlled, severe constipation and diarrhea, heartburn, you name it, I'm going to have it! I was shaking so much when I was told to sign the consent form. I just sat there and was finally told \"are you going to sign it or not\". It didn't even look like my signature. Then they took me to the infusion center. BAD IDEA!!! I won't even say what was going through my mind! But I must have had the look of death on my face because everyone was staring. Yes, then there is still the hair thing. They said to expect it completely gone in 7 days after the first treatment. That is still the hardest part of this. Not sure how I'm going to be able to handle it when the time comes. I can only imagine. I have never been so scared of anything in my life. Ok, that's the end of my venting for tonight.

I am worried about the pain from the Neulasta. They said to take Claritin a day before then I think 4 or 5 days after. I'm just as nervous about the SE of that as the chemo itself. I was also told that once the Taxol starts I need to take Claritin continuously as it helps with a lot of things for that. I'd never heard that. One other thing I was told was that I had to get these cold mitten things to wear on my hands during infusions to protect my nails. They did not mention what they were called or where to get them, just that I needed to bring them. Does anyone know anything about that?

Nothing at all! I am very happy for that, but keep sitting here waiting for something to happen. I feel like a time bomb. I have been taking my nausea medications as instructed, eating light, drinking tons of water and everything I'm supposed to be doing. The only complaint I have is that I wake up dizzy and lightheaded but I'm blaming that on the Ativan I was told to take at bedtime. The compazine I have to take during the day makes me sleepy and I did take nap yesterday. I'm going to try not taking it today and see what happens. My daughter is coming up today and we are going shopping. So my question is this? Is something wrong because I'm not feeling any SE, or is it still coming?

Talked to the nurse and she said dental work is not allowed during chemo because of risk of infection or bleeding. I really can't wait till chemo is done in late January and take a chance of more serious dental problems. Fixing it will only involve either replacing the filling or possibly a crown since there was a large chip out of the tooth to start with. No root canal or anything that would be more serious and involve getting into the gum area that would cause bleeding. My dentist was also out of the office so I can't get a hold of anyone till Monday. This is just my luck. Thoughts?",

I told her I didn't even know how to put a wig on correctly and she said well just put one hand here and the other hand there, flip your head down and put it on. But it might take a few tries. Then she just stood there. I ended up taking one I didn't want but she told me I could bring it back if I found one that matched my hair at another ACS office close by.

So I actually did that. Got a call back from a nice lady in the middle of Wyoming saying she found someone locally (colorado) that could help me and that the person I dealt with this morning had no experience in fitting wigs!

I thought I might have a good chance at not having terrible SE. I have always been very healthy with no problems. I rarely take any medication and am hardly ever sick. Surgery was easy. Hardly any pain and only 1 pain pill the whole time. I was driving in 36 hours and back to work in 48. I healed very fast and barely have any scars. I thought this would be a good sign as far as chemo is concerned, but apparently not. I didn't mention before that at least a half an hour was spent talking about constipation. I've never had a problem with that, but I guess I will now. Oh and one more thing that I've never heard from anyone on here. I need to be wearing a mask most times (even at home) to avoid any germs. That is not happenin'! I was told too that my age has a lot to do with side effects. I thought at 54 that was considered young as far as this is concerned, but again, apparently not. I can only hope and pray that they are very wrong in what they are telling me. Funny thing is that just on Monday the doctor made this sound like a piece of cake. You just go, sit there, get the infusion, and go home. Then wait until the next time. Maybe get a little tired, but nothing else. That's what made me freak out because I got told the exact opposite. I don't even know who to believe anymore!",

One of the first questions she asked me was what a typical day was like for me. I told her I worked 2 jobs, one in an elementary school and one my home business totaling at least 10 hours a day, sometimes more. So basically full time between the 2. I spent a lot of time running back and forth between schools. She said that she would not allow me to work that much because it was going to be just too much during chemo. She advised that I leave the job at school because being around 550 little kids with an already compromised immune system from the chemo was not a good thing. It was a very tough decision because I really wanted to keep the school job but the family and I decided it would be best if I would just stick with my home business, which also involves children but only 6 vs. 550. So, I resigned and am only working 3.5 hours a day at home. Financially this isn't a good thing but so far after almost 2 months we are doing ok. I have to start chemo on Friday and am very nervous that the side effects will be so bad I won't even be able to do my 3.5 hours a day. I have heard of many people who have worked full time throughout treatment though. I think a lot of it is based on age and general health to start with. In my case, I'm 54 and in great health otherwise, so I hope I am just overthinking this.",

This is the first time it was accessed. They poked me 4 or 5 times and couldn't get it to go into the port. Called the Dr. in and she said that the port had flipped over at some point and that it would be a surgical procedure to fix it. I had to go see the surgeon immediately. He was actually able to flip it back over externally and I didn't need surgery. It wasn't the most comfortable process, but at least it wasn't surgery. Made me an hour and a half late for the infusion though. Everything from there went smoothly and quickly. Start to finish was a little less than 3 hours. I was getting a little light headed towards the end of the Cytoxan, which I was told to expect but otherwise felt fine. Husband was with me, but I drove home, then went to pick up the kids from school. Still feeling good, maybe a little headache (could be leftover from the migraine yesterday) and tired from very little sleep last night. No nausea at all. I feel like I'm sitting here waiting for the bomb to drop as far as side effects. Hopefully not. Not really hungry at the moment but they gave me a huge sandwich for lunch (hubby ate half of it) and I've been drinking LOTS of water. Except for the port problem, it seemed like an uneventful day. Came home to a package on my doorstep. It was a book someone sent me called I'd Rather Do Chemo Than Clean Out the Garage. Looks like a touch of humor on a serious subject. Maybe there is a lighter side to this after all. I'll check it out. Will keep you posted as things progress. Hopefully they won't.",

I'm waiting for an itemized bill from the hospital and doctors so I can start the process of matching that to charges billed to the insurance. I got a random statement from the insurance last week saying they paid out a $2400 claim with no explanation of what it was! No wonder we pay a zillion dollars for our health insurance!",

I bought a wig, then found out about the ACS program. I went to their office and they gave me a beautiful human hair wig (they also had synthetic). The Pantene company has a program where people can donate their hair then they have it made into wigs and donate them to the ACS. It's a great program. This wig is much nicer than the one I paid big $$ for. The wig shop was selling human hair wigs for $3000-$5000!! I had both wigs cut to match my own hair style.",

KD--I just asked the nurse during infusion yesterday about icing during Taxol. She said that studies have proven that icing does not change the chance of getting neuropathy or experiencing nail changes. I guess this is something very new. Up until the last couple of weeks they and the MO's recommended it and provided the cold mitts and wraps for feet. But now they will allow it only if the patient wants to do it and recommend you bring your own equipment. I will be one of those who does it. Definitely. Not taking any chances. I know someone who has neuropathy so bad from Taxol she can barely walk. My center provides the cold mitts and foot wraps if we request them, or you can buy your own on Amazon. They are about $99 a pair. Actually here's the link. They also have the ones for feet. You get a little bit of a discount if you buy both. https://www.amazon.com/Elasto-Gel-Chemotherapy-Hyp...=sr_1_sc_12_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1475934528&sr=8-12-spell&keywords=cold+therapy+mits Has anyone experienced migraines during chemo? It's happened my last two rounds on AC. It starts during the premeds, somewhere between the end of the steroid drip and the beginning of the Emend. I'm given Aloxi before both of those. I'm prone to migraines anyway and these follow true to form. Blurred vision for about half hour, then the pain gradually starts. Add that to the sinus type headache that is typical with Cytoxan (I timed it yesterday--exactly 18 minutes into the Cytoxan that headache started) Migraine pain continues for several hours, Cytoxan headache lasts into the night. There is a distinct difference in the two. After migraine pain goes away my eyes get very sore and dry, then comes getting suddenly very hungry. That's the signal the migraine is over. Dr. years ago told me these are classic symptoms. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this during chemo and if you have found a solution so you don't get it. The good news is only one round of AC left. Thank goodness. I read something that someone wrote trying to be funny about the AC. She said that they measure out the amount that will cause you to be dearly departed, then back off just a little bit. There were a couple of days after round 2 that I actually believed that. Hoping round 3 is better since the steroids were cut in half again. So far so good.",

Then 6 weeks of radiation. Sometimes I feel like I will be 100 till this is all done! They are changing the length of time of infusion because the last two times I have had horrific headaches that last for days from the premeds--specifically the Aloxi. This was confirmed by the MO today. I had an interesting conversation with the MO during my visit today about hair. I still have about a fourth of mine left. At my appointment 2 months ago she assured me it would start growing back once Taxol started. Today she assured me that what I have will fall out and any new hair I might grow will also fall out. I don't know what to believe because nurses and lots of people on these boards have said that their hair did start growing during Taxol. Has anyone gotten any feedback on this? Dennyj--good luck with your passport. Mine is due to expire in Feb. I was wondering about wearing a hat, scarf or wig so I actually went and had a new picture taken the day before I started chemo. I won't put the application in until after the first of the year. I wonder how current a picture has to be. There is no date on the photo so hopefully they will accept it. As far as itchy wigs, here is my experience. I have two different wigs. One is the real hair one I got free from ACS. The other is a synthetic wig I paid a lot of money for. I much prefer the real hair wig. It is not near as hot nor is it itchy. It is thicker and heavier hair than the other one, but it must breathe better because it has not been hot at all. The synthetic one feels like, well, fake hair. It is kind of stiff and hair feels rough. Little strands of hair poke through the wig cap and make me really itchy and it is HOT!!! I wear the real hair one daily for work and usually only wear the other one when I wash the real hair wig. That's another thing--real hair wigs can be washed and styled just as you would your own hair using hot rollers, curling irons, hair spray, etc. Not the synthetic. It has very specific care instructions which only includes very low heat for styling and special shampoo for washing it. Congratulations to everyone who has finished AC or will be soon! What a relief! ",

I had one day after the first Taxol treatment that I was tired and felt achy. It was on day 3. It could have been because I ran around like a crazy person the 2 days after treatment because I felt great. I talked to the NP about it and she said that first, she was glad I'm staying active, but that I way overdid it on the weekend, and second that I'm not allowing myself enough time to rest. She said that all chemo patients should take at least a half hour to an hour of total down time or sleep twice a day and pace ourselves the rest of the day. Also, she thought I may have been somewhat dehydrated. Ever since the last AC treatment I have been slacking on my water intake. I thought I'd be a good patient that day and when I got home from my appointment (after 4 stops for errands after that) I decided I'd rest a little. It lasted about 5 minutes. I picked up my laptop and then remembered I had an online class I needed to finish for my job. 2 1/2 hours and one fried brain later I was done and it was time to go pick up my 6 daycare kids from school. That was my rest. Welcome to my life!! Have a great weekend everyone and if there are any veterans or current military members reading this, thank you for your service to this great country of ours.

I was looking on Amazon for the first name you posted and couldn't find anything. I was thinking about something though. If the compression socks are supposed to increase circulation (the reason diabetics wear them) and icing your hands and feet during Taxol is supposed to constrict the blood vessels and prevent a normal blood flow, wouldn't they counteract each other. Does the study you read mention this. I will try anything to prevent neuropathy and it obviously worked for you but I'd be interested in hearing if the study mentions this. As far as the supplements I take B complex and B6 daily. The B6 between the two total 150 mg a day. MO told me only 100 mg a day but I still take 150. I also take D3--1000 IU daily and was told yesterday by the NP that I should take it for the rest of my life because studies show a lower rate of recurrence in patients who take D3. I plan on doing some reading on this when I have a chance. I do know that the D3 also helps with calcium absorption which is something that the Taxol affects. Taxol #8 was quick and easy today. I feel great today and will tomorrow (steroids) but I know the leg, hip and now knee pain I have been having will hit by Monday. It lasted all week last week. NP told me to expect that and the fatigue to get worse before this is over. Not looking forward to that.",

All I know about my treatment (will find out on Monday) is that it will be 20 weeks, first 8 weeks every other week, and weekly for the next 12 weeks, then 6 weeks of radiation and 5-10 years of hormone therapy. That is an eternity! Ive heard so many varying stories about the cold caps. Besides being expensive, they are cumbersome and uncomfortable and that they could prevent the chemo from reaching all of the cells it is meant to reach. On the other hand I have heard that they really do work. I don't even have any resources to get any info on them. If you have anything you could share I would appreciate it. So you haven't lost any hair at all? That is what I am the MOST scared of! I have several meltdowns a day because of it. Had one in Walmart earlier today. I'm finding myself looking at every woman I see, their hairstyle, if it looks like they're wearing a wig, if they have hair at all, etc. I know, kind of weird of me, but I didn't even realize I was doing it until today. How have your side effects been otherwise? I have heard the side effects can be debilitating as in sick in bed for days. And that you get so tired you just have to sleep for days on end. I just can't do that I have a job and a family and lots of outside responsibilities, as we all do. See why I am so scared? Everyone on this site has been absolutely wonderful. I joined one of the other boards on here too and got lots of good advice and support during the time leading up to my surgery. That seems like a breeze compared to what I am now facing. Thank you so much!!!!! By the way I'm 54.",

I've never seen so many people scrambling at once. Everyone was on the phone talking to someone different and they sent me to the waiting room. They finally came out and said to get to the surgeons office right away. They said it was urgent and would likely require me having surgery, right then and there. That scared me a lot! Surgeons office is in the same building. He took one look at it and said \"yep, its flipped alright\". He was pressing around on it and finally said \"you'll feel some discomfort, kind of like having a baby turned if they are breech\" Then it was total panic because I had that happen and that was the worst pain and a very horrible experience I ever had! And it didn't work. Baby was still breech and I had to have C section. But he was able to get the port turned back over and it was uncomfortable but not terribly painful though. I'll probably have some bruising but at least I didn't have to have surgery. Still feeling ok, headache is almost gone and still drinking lots of water. I'm probably close to 4 qts today. I sure am hoping to have the same results in the next few days as you! How many infusions have you had?",

Well, what I found out is that it is a fancy name for a \"how are you doing?\" check up. I was asked a lot of questions about any side effects I experienced and when they happened. I had been keeping a journal and it was handy to have that to refer to. She said that the effects of AC are typical, but that the fatigue is cumulative. I am definitely not looking forward to that. She said that the dizziness and being light headed on days 5 and 6 were from the chemo meds themselves, but that it could also be the steroids, which is what I suspected all along. She said that I could cut the at home steroids in half for the next infusion and see if that makes a difference. In the beginning, I was prescribed the scopolamine patches to put on the day before treatment to help with nausea. She said that as long as I have the patch on (72 hours, starting the day before infusion), that I am not to take the Compazine. They are similar drugs and could cause an adverse reaction, especially being extremely dizzy. I definitely experienced that and was not previously told not to use those two together. I was also advised not to take the nausea meds as a preventative as I was originally told by the infusion nurse. But that's about it. A toxicity check was no big deal.",

She said if the boots they have aren't available and the patient doesn't have their own they bring them a bucket or bowl with ice bags in it to put your feet in. That would surely solve the problem of how to hold the ice packs in place. Just wouldn't be able to recline in the chairs during that time. I think I will ask where I could see a copy of this study. One of the receptionists told me, when I was asking about using the mitts/boots they provide there is that its the doctors who are saying they don't want them offered anymore to patients. They want them to buy their own. Then when I questioned the nurse she was telling me about this study. Believe me I will be bugging them about this often. I don't want to have to spend $200 to buy the mitts/boots and I think they should offer alternatives if they aren't going to provide them. On another note, does anyone know off hand what drugs they give with the Taxol. I knew Benadryl and steroids, but is there anything else? Do they still give the anti nausea meds? I'm on day 2 after AC #3. So far so good. Have not had nausea or taken any nausea meds. No side effects except that my eyes really hurt. I think that is a result of the migraine I had. I did have to call the on call dr today when the Neulasta pod had finished injecting. When it finished it just kept beeping and beeping for a long time. The instructions said if it did that and the red light was flashing to call the dr. I did, got the one on call, and he had no idea what was going on. I knew the medicine had injected so he said just to take it off.",

But 10 more treatments would definitely give him more income too! I happened to remember one set of statistics he told me when I met with him awhile back. He said that with a cancer diagnoses with no treatment the chances of recurrence are 100% (obviously), With surgery it decreases it to 50%, and with chemo 25% and with radiation they want to get the percentage down to the single digits. I'm not sure what formula is used to determine that final percentage. I'm sure hoping we can all be in the single digits by the time we're done. My MO told me in the beginning, when I was considering not doing chemo, that the chances of recurrence with surgery and radiation only is 50% so that kind of goes along with that I guess. That one single conversation is what convinced me on the chemo.",

It's embarrassing. I had a survivorship appointment at the beginning of August. One of the people I met with told me that the effects of chemo are with us for 18 months after the last treatment. Even if our blood counts are back to normal our body is still feeling the effects. I'd guess chemo brain is one of them. I have been without a wig since the end of may. My hair is about 2.5 inches long and is getting curly which I am thrilled about. Everyone keeps telling me I should keep it short but I'm not convinced.

About to the point of not being able to function. I haven't slept and have not eaten in 3 days. She's having a biopsy on Friday to confirm what they already know. I don't know much about pancreatic cancer except that it's bad--really bad. I'm to the point of wanting to cancel all of my oncology/PT appointments for the rest of the year to be with my mom.

Love that photo! I had my MRI They imaged the wrong area. They did my lower back instead of my mid back. It figures. But, that MRI revealed a suspicious lesion on my adrenal gland and also a compressed nerve in my spine and the cause of the back pain I've had for 15 years. My MO ordered another immediate MRI of my abdominal area. Adrenal gland issue was nothing but that MRI now showed some kind of \"spots\" in my mid spine (which should have been imaged in the first place). Another MRI ordered. Insurance denied it but said to have a nuclear bone scan instead. Had that on Tuesday. That showed some kind of lesion on my skull. So then I had to have xrays of my skull. There is a calcification there and nothing to worry about. I've spent this entire month at the doctor it seems like. The worry is never going to go away that cancer is going to show up somewhere else. I also had a minor surgical procedure on my feet last week. So now I'm still fighting to have the MRI of the area that should have happened in the first place and I have also been referred to a spine surgeon for my back pain. I saw him yesterday. I've been referred for surgery and waiting on insurance approval. Not thrilled about surgery, but it is a minor procedure and will finally relieve the pain I've lived with for years.

I did see a really nice synthetic one there that exactly matched my hair, but needed to be cut a little different. I will probably end up getting that one then hoping the freebie wig to will work too if they can get the right one in. I don't remember, when did you say you started chemo? You can PM me if you want.

Ours too told me I had to use one of their preferred providers, but there wasn't even one close by. The representative then told me (I think he discontinued recording the call too) because he was talking really quiet, to go ahead and get the wig where I wanted. Get an invoice with the insurance code (he even gave me that) and submit it manually to the insurance company. He said they would initially deny it but that I need to appeal it immediately. I had mentioned to him that I care for children and that consistency in their daily routine is the best for their growth and development. I can't go from one day having hair to the next with none and a wig is absolutely necessary to maintain that consistency in their routine. He said that if I wrote a letter during the appeal process it would likely get approved because insurance companies don't want to get a bad name for themselves by denying something like this for that reason. You could use something specific to your situation and try the same thing. I sent in the original claim last week. Waiting for the denial then the fun begins. Normally this is a covered expense, but my husband's work, who carries the insurance, made this an exclusion. I'm normally a pretty calm and easy going person except for where insurance is involved. We pay an arm and a leg to have it, they can cover our necessary expenses. But don't get me started on that! So glad Emily is faring well through the first round.

When I had my appointment on Thursday I mentioned how awful I felt and was told that it was not from the steroids, but from the chemo itself, but I could believe it was the steroids if I wanted. I believe it! I took Compazine too. Ended up feeling really dizzy and dopey from that too and all I did was sleep. I only took it the day after infusion because they told me to take it as a preventative. I never had nausea so I quit the next day. I was prescribed the scopolomine patches to put on the day before chemo and to leave on for 2 days following. I learned the other day that you should never have the patch an take Compazine at the same time because they are similar meds. So basically I was getting a double dose.

I can also style it, use the curling iron on it and everything I did to my real hair. I guess maybe that part is a mental thing for me. It's definitely more like my real hair than synthetic.",

It is hard on your skin if it gets on it. Makes it very dry. I use a cotton swab and put it on that way. I can control more of where it goes. I was using a cotton ball and that was bad news for my skin. I did read somewhere that you can dilute it 50/50 with other types of oil to make it not so harsh. Are you sure the pain you felt in your thighs was neuropathy? I had similar pain in my back, legs and hips on day 3 and part of day 4 after the first Taxol treatment. I'd say it was moderate pain. I mentioned it to the nurse practitioner I saw yesterday after I had labs drawn and she said that is a common side effect of the Taxol and a lot of people experience it on days 2-4 after their infusion. She said to take tylenol or ibuprofen and the B6 (I take a B complex too) and also Claritin, just like we took for bone pain from the Neulasta. They also told me in my chemo class in Sept. that I should take Claritin daily all through Taxol treatment so I've been doing that too. Hopefully the claritin and vitamins are built up enough now that there won't be the pain this time. Give it a try if you aren't already. Take care and keep us posted on how things go for you.

Originally I was advised to take a B complex and an additional B6. I was never told the dosage though. I have been reading that 200 mg is way too much and it causes a lot of problems including a higher risk of neuropathy. I looked and my total dosage of B6 between the two was 150 mg. I asked my MO yesterday how much B6 was too much and told her how much I was taking. Her eyes got kind of big and she said to immediately stop taking that much and to take only 100 mg a day. That is a safe amount she said. I know all doctors have different standards of care, but wanted to let you know what I learned yesterday. I had Taxol #5 today. No problems as of yet. I got the referral to the radiology oncologist yesterday and I meet for my consultation with him next week. I won't start radiation until mid February and I was surprised they wanted this consultation in early December. It's ok though. The more I can get on this year's insurance the better. I have a tentative start and end date of radiation so that puts an end in sight, yet the thought of adding 6 weeks of radiation on top of 7 more chemo treatments I still have makes the time seem so much longer. Like everyone, I just want to be done with this! Good news though, I asked about if there would be any travel restrictions after chemo and radiation are done and was told I can go wherever I want. No restrictions. We're in the process of planning our June vacation and I'm excited to know I will be able to get away. We will all need a vacation after this!! Have a great weekend everyone!",

Does anyone know if they would delay chemo from a low white count? I know that happens when the red counts drop too low. I'm being very careful to not go anywhere there are crowds of people to avoid getting sick. I have lost most of what was left of my hair after AC and my eyebrows are now thinning. I am not happy about that. But I do have a lot of new hair coming in. It's about 1/16\" long. I have heard that the Nioxin brand of hair products are good to use to get hair growing faster. Has anyone used them and had any success? I looked on their website and there are several different formulas. Not sure which one to use, if any at all. I had my radiology consultation last week. I was surprised to have this a full 2 months before I start radiation. I have my full appointment schedule now including the rest of chemo, port removal, radiation and a few of the follow ups afterwards. I'm not sure if that makes it seem like the end is in sight or that there is still a very long time to go before this is over, because it goes into late spring/early summer.

While I was going into the exam room there was a woman coming out of another one who the surgeon later told me had just had her port removed. She had a large bandage on her chest but she had a smile on her face and he told me that she had said \"it wasn't too bad\". Hoping that is accurate information. Can't wait to mark the end of this chemo! 5 months of this is a long haul!! I met with the RO about 3 weeks ago. He asked me if I'd be interested in being part of a study to determine recurrence of cancer in 4 weeks of radiation vs. the standard 6 weeks. He was telling me all about it then he told me he would never recommend a 4 week treatment for anyone in his family because there is no proof that 4 weeks is as effective as 6. That was enough to convince me. NO WAY am I taking any chances of recurrence by being part of that trial. The thought of having to go through this again is enough to give me nightmares! My hair seems to grow every day which I'm thrilled about, especially since I'm not even done with chemo yet. Getting nervous because from what I can see I have the skunk look going on. White on the top, dark on the sides. That's a scary thought! I'm sure hoping that the top changes to dark as that is my natural color. Someone said the chemo takes the pigment out of new hair and the color won't come back until chemo is done. Again, I hope that's accurate information.",

Is this what you've heard or is there another reason that it starts out white. That's exactly what the top of my head looks like--a bunch of white, fuzzy, sticking straight up hair. I've got the start of looking like a skunk. Dark on the sides, white on the top. Hoping the white stuff goes away. It'll be a very long time until I'm comfortable enough to go without a wig and as I said, I'm looking into extensions as soon as my hair is long enough. I'm not a patient person.

Tomorrow I will finish my very last radiation treatment-- #30 of 30--6 weeks. I dreaded it so much in the beginning. I'd already had surgery and 20 weeks of chemo. Like you, I was tired of appointments, I was tired of everything. 6 weeks seemed like such a long time to have to go there 5 days a week. I was scared to death of the side effects. As I look back on the last 6 weeks, I've realized it has gone incredibly fast. Actually I can't believe that tomorrow is my last treatment. Each appointment has gone quickly and has been uneventful. I had none of the side effects that they said are possible. No burning, no pain and no fatigue. The only thing I have to show for 6 weeks of treatment is a painless red spot on my neck from radiating the lymph nodes. It is healing quickly. I have made some new friends in some of the staff members and other patients. But do you know what the most important thing is that I've gained from radiation treatment. It's the fact that I know that I have done every possible thing that I can to fight this awful thing. I thought about skipping chemo. The thought of going through that was the worst of the worst. But I kept thinking of the what if's. What if the cancer comes back and what if the reason it came back was because I skipped chemo. Each step of the process lowers the recurrence rate percentage. The final decision on radiation is yours and yours alone, but I know you will find radiation a piece of cake and it will be over before you know it. You can do it my friend! Hugs.",

I hope they are just taking extra precautions and that all your news will be good. Please keep us posted. I've just been through the wringer myself lately. I went to an orthopedic doctor in October for some pain in my hip. She did xrays which determined something was wrong in my spine. Everyone immediately thought it was bone mets. Long story short I had 2 sets of xrays, 2 mri's and a nuclear bone scan. Each scan showed something else of concern relating to cancer. But it was determined there were no mets at all, but that I had a severely pinched nerve in my lower back and a bone spur digging into that nerve as well. I'd had back pain for 15 years and finally the cause was determined. I was referred to a spine surgeon. I had surgery yesterday, which turned into a major ordeal and more extensive than they said but I already feel so much better. A little dopey yet from the anesthesia but I've had no pain meds today at all, I walked to the grocery store and around the neighborhood, did laundry and baked 3 pies today. This was the first time I ever willingly went in to surgery. It's hard to trust my oncology team that there truly isn't anything in my spine that is cancer related. I should have had a third MRI to confirm but the insurance declined it. Happy Thanksgiving everyone!! We all have much to be thankful for this year. Just think, last year this time we were all in the middle of chemo.",

I had 2 jobs, working a total of 10 hours a day. The doctor told me during the first visit that was too much with what I was going to be going through. I had to resign from one but absolutely have to keep working the other one without missing a beat. Our finances depend on it. Someone told me that \"chemo is what you make it\", meaning if you think you are going to have side effects you will, if you believe you won't, then you won't. I'm not sure how that is even possible and I have yet to get myself in that mindset. Not even sure how to do it. This person said on a scale of 1-10, the worst she ever felt was a 4.

Having the port put in wasn't bad, but I will have to say for me it was the worst part of all the surgery and the thing that took the longest to heal. I never even really had any pain from the other two incisions I have. I'll be interested to see how you feel. Take care and have a great rest! Talk to you later.",

I found a lot of relief by putting a small ice pack on the area for a while every couple hours or so. I didn't get to where I could sleep on that side until just a couple days ago. I have been sleeping in a small separate bed since surgery to avoid getting husband's elbow right on that spot. I had a lot of bruising in the port area too. Probably more than the two surgery sites. It will get better I promise. I told my surgeon when I was in there the other day that when it is time to get this thing out I will not wait for his office to open. I will be on the doorstep of HIS HOUSE early in the morning on that day! Having the port makes this all too real!",

I've been struggling for a couple of weeks to wrap my head around \"chemo is what you make it\" comment. In my experience with this so far, everything has been the worst possible news and I'm scared to death the next steps are no exception. My first doctor said \"it's probably nothing\" when all this first started. Yeah right. He isn't my doctor any longer. Nayda--I love your play by play commentary! That is just what I need. I am the type of person who needs to know what's going to happen, when its happening, how it's happening, where and how much its going to cost. I just have to know ahead of time and have a plan in place. Your story about your port makes me nervous! Well, actually the whole thing has me scared to death. But this is exactly the kind of thing I need to hear. How long did the actual infusion take? What did they tell you about driving yourself to and from treatments? Thank you! To everyone else--Thank you for sharing your experiences. Again, that is just what I need to hear. I am absolutely terrified of the next steps. I HAVE to be able to keep working (dr. made me cut down to part time) so the side effects need to be minimal. I am horrified at the thought of losing my hair. I work with children and I have to maintain a sense of normalcy for them in the way I look, feel and act. I can't be any different in their eyes. I have a wig lined up that exactly matches my hair, but I know I will feel like I have a flashing red light on top of my head with a sign saying \"hey look everyone, she has cancer and is bald underneath this fake hair!\" I can't even bear the thought of facing my family like that. Another thing that is irritating me to no end is the comments I'm getting from everyone else in regard to this. \"oh you'll be fine\" (maybe not), \"you just need to be positive\" (how can I, I have cancer!), it's just hair, it'll grow back\" (but its MY hair attached to MY head), \"I'm sure the time will just fly by through this process\" (it already feels like time is standing still), or \"you should be happy, it could be worse\" (it is pretty bad already). You get the idea. I have tried to keep this private and only sharing with closest family and friends, but a couple of people have made it their business to be a blabber mouth and tell everyone they see. I went to Walgreens last night and one of the employees comes up to me and said \"Oh I hear you have cancer\". I asked who told her and she said it was one of my closest friends who I trusted to keep her mouth shut! I am a constant bucket of tears and have many meltdowns per day. One in the middle of Walmart yesterday. I saw a paper the doctor had to fill out for something with my my husbands work. She wrote on there that I can expect to be incapacitated for the full 5 months of treatment. WHAT!? That can't happen. Ok, my rant is over. Sorry for throwing this on all of you. I am not one to talk to someone one on one or in a group face to face, so being able to put this out there in writing is a great help to me. Thanks for listening. you are all truly wonderful! Please keep sharing your experiences!",

Also I got a shopping list for all of the over the counter meds I need to get as well as suggestions for high protein snacks which I was told was a very important part of the healing process and needed to maintain energy. I have heard that some places do this on the day of the first infusion though. I'm glad to have the information, but they tell you all of the possible things that can go wrong and it was enough to scare me to death. The hardest part was when I had to sign the consent form. I felt like I was handing my life over to them. I just sat there and stared at the paper and she finally said \"are you going to sign it or not\". I was shaking so much it didn't even look like my signature. They brought in the person who handles the insurance and financial end of it, then two of the chemo nurses came in and talked to me for a few minutes. It was at least a two hour appointment.

I sleep on that side so it could have happened then, I'm keeping a close eye on it. He said that it is rare for this to happen and if it does it again he will have to go in there and suture it in.

Infusion center provided drinks and lunch. The only thing I wish I would have had was a jacket. I had a blanket but a jacket would have been so much better. Will remember next time. As far as the port, it was tender for awhile and it was hard to get comfortable to sleep. Mine was put in during surgery a month ago so it had plenty of time to heal before they accessed it the first time. My best advice for you is to drink a lot of fluid before, during and after your infusion. I was told to drink 2-3 quarts per water a day anyway, but that day I know I drank at least 4 quarts. I really believe it helped a lot with the side effects. Which chemo regimen are you getting?",

The infusion nurse instructed me to take it as a preventative measure for nausea starting the following day. When I saw the FNP yesterday she was asking me about all of that. I was also prescribed the scopolomaine patch to wear for 72 hours starting the day before infusion. She said that the meds in the patch and the Compazine were in the same family and that they could not be used together. Either one or the other and I was feeling so foggy and dizzy because it was basically an overdose. I'm going to verify this with the actual doctor. I also have Zofran which they said not to take until 3 days following infusion (never even took that) and Ativan which I am supposed to take at night to counteract the effects of the steroids so I can sleep. For the next time I was told, since I didn't have any SE the first time, to hold off on the nausea meds, unless I am actually feeling something. Not sure that is a good idea either.

They changed the infusion time to avoid the horrific headache I got last time and so far I feel great. Hope it lasts. But, as is my luck, there is always a problem. No sooner did I get home and I checked the Neulasta pod to make sure it was still blinking. I noticed that the adhesive that holds it on was off on the whole top half of it and the little needle thing was mostly out. Great! I called them and they said to come back immediately. So back we went. After a bunch of people looked at it they determined it was faulty adhesive (really?!) and had to replace it. Usually those things are stuck on there so hard that I feel like I'm peeling my skin off trying to remove it. This was just another time in this process that they said \"oh, this has never happened to anyone before\". Figures. I better not get a bill for $18,000 now because the insurance won't cover the replacement. They said I wouldn't, but once again, that would be just my luck. But it's done and hopefully Taxol will be as easy as they said it would be. They gave me the calendar for all of the Taxol treatments. At least on paper the end is in sight. I'm not feeling it yet, but the paper says so. Onward! ",

I feel like I haven't slept in years and really that's all I've done this week! I'm still interested in the varying information about hair growing back on Taxol. I've been told that it will grow back by several nurses and heard it from other patients. MO originally told me it would grow back too. When I saw her last week she said it would not grow back and the hair I had left as well as brows and lashes would be gone soon. I've read it on these boards that many people have had theirs start growing back, yet others say theirs fell out. Guess everyone is different. My biggest concern is the neuropathy that goes with Taxol though. VERY worried about that. I read somewhere that 67% of people get it. I was told by nurses at my last infusion that the doctors are no longer recommending icing hands and feet to prevent it. Once again, who knows what we can believe anymore. I don't know about all of you, but this needs to hurry up and be done!!!",

Did any of your hair grow back on Taxol? I didn't lose all mine on AC and am getting varying stories of whether it will start growing back on Taxol or if I will lose what I have left. My 4th AC was the worst. Again no SE to speak of, but I just felt horrible for a full week and a level of fatigue I have never felt before. I really hope that doesn't happen with the Taxol.

I did get sleepy from the Benadryl, but I believe the nurse gave me the wrong amount as the other nurse said it should only have been 25 mg rather than the 50 she gave me. The only issue was that after they started the pre meds I got a call from the pharmacist saying that since I was already there they were recommending an IV drip of potassium as my level has been dropping, which I knew. I'm already taking prescription supplements but was told I need more. I told them that was fine, but what they didn't tell me was that the drip takes 4 hours and involves 4 bags of the stuff given at a very slow rate. This was after they started it. I absolutely had to be home by a certain time as I had to pick up my daycare kids from school and since I didn't know about this in advance, I wasn't able to make arrangements ahead of time. I made it through 3 bags and I absolutely had to leave. There was no other option. Anyway, I feel great so far. A world of difference from that nasty AC. I iced my hands and feet using the cold gel mitts that they provided. I don't think they stayed cold enough and they didn't have another set to switch out. I hope it at least helped some. I am taking Vitamin B6, B complex and was told by NP yesterday to start D3 to help with calcium absorbtion. And Claritin if I want as sometimes bone aches and pains are a side effect. I will also start putting tea tree oil on my nails as an extra precaution.",

Although I have had someone with me during the chemo treatments that could drive me, I needed to be fully alert 2 hours after treatment is finished so I can drive for my job. For the first Taxol treatment they gave me 50 mg of Benadryl in case of an allergic reaction. The only thing I reacted to was the Benadryl itself. Before it even was all in I was very dizzy and shaky--enough that my husband had to walk with me to the bathroom. That feeling lasted about 30 minutes and I slept for about 45 minutes, was fine. The second treatment the Benadryl was reduced to 25 mg. No dizziness and shaking but still sleepy. Third treatment it was cut to 12.5 mg. Still a little sleepy and had to take a nap. My 4th infusion will be on Friday and I have already asked to have it cut down to 6.25 mg to try to avoid the sleepiness. The nurses said that is the lowest dose they can give because they can't completely eliminate it in case there is an allergic reaction. If after your first Taxol treatment you don't have any type of reaction (and they will watch you closely and said if it's going to happen it will be at the beginning of the infusion), definitely ask if they can cut the Benadryl down. I also get 10 mg of Decadron and Pepcid, both to prevent any type of reaction. I hope you are as pleasantly surprised as I was with the Taxol. It's a breath of fresh air after AC!!!! It's amazing to feel somewhat normal again! Good luck!!",

I keep waiting for the bomb to drop, but this is now day 4 so hopefully I'm soon out of the woods. They said days 2-4 would be the worst. I actually spent the day yesterday shopping with my daughter, cooking, cleaning, and laundry. My biggest complaint is the steroids I have had to take the last 3 days have made me dizzy.

Over the past few days, I have had times when I feel great then an hour later I feel terrible and need to sleep, then great, then terrible. I still think it is the effects of the stupid steroids.

I am depressed at a level I have never experienced before. It's starting to scare me and my family. I'm to the point that I feel like even after one treatment I absolutely cannot do this anymore. Ive been exhausted for the last 4 days and spend a lot of my time crying. The sheet I got with the prescription says depression and mood swings are a side effect of steroids. I thought I was going to be ok after getting through the first infusion last week with no side effects, but this is another story. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that my days with hair on my head are numbered. I really admire all of you ladies who have been able to accept that as part of this journey. I can't seem to do that. Thoughts?",

I had my oral steroids cut in half for AC round 2. I thought I was going to make it through, but yesterday afternoon I hit the wall, same as last time. Short of breath, heart pounding, shakiness and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest. Kind of like they describe a heart attack. I was so tired and went to bed at 8 last night, slept till 6 this morning and got up feeling like I hadn't slept at all. Today I did absolutely nothing. I did get a nap this afternoon and now, the same as 2 weeks ago, I feel like I've had about 3 gallons of Mountain Dew and am running on a caffeine high. Guess I'll be revisiting the steroid issue again next week before #3. I know they give them for nausea but since I have had none of that at all, I wonder if its the steroids working, or if I'm just not going to get it. I feel like I need to choose the lesser of the two evils. The hair issue--Today is day 20 after first infusion. It started shedding on day 14 or 15, but I have not cut my hair nor worn the wig yet. I still have about half of it firmly attached to my head. It is noticeably thinner but I have no bald spots. I wonder if on AC if it is possible for some of the hair to remain. I doubt it but wishful thinking I guess. I also have not had the tingling or sore scalp that some describe. I'm sure my day is coming soon. I figured it would be long gone by now. Still a depressing thought to me. Here's sending everyone best wishes for their next round. By the way, I love that all of you are sharing such wonderful photos! You are all beautiful.

I really can't wait till chemo is done in late January and take a chance of more serious dental problems. Fixing it will only involve either replacing the filling or possibly a crown since there was a large chip out of the tooth to start with. No root canal or anything that would be more serious. My dentist was also out of the office today so I can't get a hold of anyone till Monday. This is just my luck. Thoughts?",

I finished chemo (no herceptin) on Jan 20. On Feb 3 my port was out. I have a friend who finished her herceptin at the end of May and had the port out in mid June. I think it's just the opinion of the doctors. I wanted mine out asap after chemo. And what a relief it was to be rid of that. After the surgeon was finished he handed me a small paper bag. I didn't open it until I got home. It was the port. I told my husband I was giving it to him to hang from his rear view mirror. LOL. On another note, I am going back to the surgeon for my one year follow up in August. He is going to do a revision on my port scar. I'm not happy with how it healed and my MO and PCP both agreed so he is going to fix it. Docmama--I love your story! I bet that waitress was so embarrassed! I find it interesting, and somewhat sad, how so many people's opinions are based on our looks--well, mostly our hair. When we were in Mexico in June there was a woman at our resort who I saw almost every day. She was completely bald, I'm assuming from chemo. I was watching other people's reactions to her and wanted to chase down some of them for laughing and pointing at her. If they only knew. She had more courage than I ever did. I wouldn't even go to the back yard without my wig let alone on vacation. I'm still embarrassed to go in public looking like this and my hair is about 2 inches long now. A year ago today I got news of a bad mammogram and was waiting for an ultrasound and later a biopsy to be scheduled. My official diagnosis was on July 22. I am finding that I am having some emotional struggles about this. I can't believe it's been a year. I feel like I missed so much of it because of cancer. Our 32nd wedding anniversary is on Thursday. We didn't even get to celebrate that last year as cancer was confirmed in the ultrasound the day before. My daughter's and husband's birthdays are both this week too--something else we didn't get to enjoy last year. My birthday in October went unnoticed because I was sick from my last AC chemo. It's so great to hear from everybody. Too bad we all don't live near one another. We could have a one year, end of cancer, or better yet a Holy S*** party. What I'm really doing on my one year anniversary of diagnosis on Saturday is having a garage sale to get rid of all of the junk that's accumulated this past year that I haven't had time to sort through and put away.

I was diagnosed July 2016, surgery in August followed by 20 weeks of chemo and 6 weeks of radiation and now 6 months into 10 years of hormone therapy. Today I had my 6 month after radiation followup, extensive blood work and the dreaded first mammogram. I was sick with worry, fearing a repeat of this last year. But great news! I got a clean bill of health. Exam, blood work and mammogram were all normal!!! I'm a very happy girl tonight! A year ago I never dreamed this day would come. I am back in physical therapy for radiation induced fibrosis in my arm but that should be done by the end of the year. I am thrilled that my hair is growing back curly, just as I had hoped, although it's not growing nearly fast enough to suit me. Last year I missed my October birthday, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years because of feeling crummy from chemo. This year I'm celebrating them all! We have all been through so much together this past year. My wish is that everyone has come through the past months with flying colors. We all deserve a huge celebration for making it through this wild ride.",

It's been tough for all of us to get to this point. And it seems that just when we get through one cancer related ordeal, another one starts. Sounds like many of us have had our share lately. I had to see my MO last week after scan after scan during the month of October. 2 sets of xrays, 2 MRI's and a nuclear bone scan. Each new scan brought a new worry of cancer. Thankfully nothing was found cancer related but the source of my continuous back pain was found. Surprisingly, insurance approved back surgery. That's happening on the 21st, next Tuesday. It's supposed to be a simple outpatient procedure but I am going to have a lot of restrictions for the next 4-12 weeks. No lifting, bending, twisting, stretching, snow shoveling, vacuuming, making beds, no heavy loads of laundry, no riding in a car for more than an hour and the list goes on. I'm afraid my family is not going to be too thrilled for me to be out of commission for awhile. Even through chemo I continued to do everything I usually did. The silver lining is that this surgery is getting me out of cooking Thanksgiving dinner this year! We are having our dinner prepared by a local restaurant and picking it up Thanksgiving morning. My mom is doing ok. She has had her treatment delayed 3 different times already. She is participating in a clinical trial and the delays have to do with that. She should start next week, the same day as my surgery. She told me that the nurse called her yesterday and told her that according to a recent CT scan, her tumor had grown a \"tiny bit\" in the last month. Turns out that tiny bit is almost a full centimeter in a month. That's bad. Really, really bad! This is just unimaginable that something so awful is happening to my mom. This is so hard.",

That was definitely the case yesterday. The bad one came right off when the nurse asked me to take it off. I told her that it usually takes awhile to get it off because it's like it's on there with super glue. When I took the one off today after it injected, I thought my skin was coming with it. Yikes! But at least that's the last one! I did ask if my insurance would be billed for both and they said exactly what you did. That the drug company would cover the cost of the faulty one. Good thing because mine are $18,000 each!! Funny that you mention DD Taxol. I was just sure that when I saw my MO on Thursday and when she found out that the ONLY side effect I had from AC was being tired (headaches were pre med interactions so I guess that doesn't count) I just knew she was going to recommend DD Taxol instead of 12 weekly treatments. She didn't say a word though. I do remember reading somewhere that the higher dose of Taxol has similar side effects to AC and that's why doctors often recommend 12 lower dose treatments. DD is given every 3 weeks over 12 weeks, correct? I guess it really doesn't save any time on the length of treatment, just the number of infusions. I start Taxol on Nov 4. I know it's going to be a pain going in every week but maybe it's a good trade off for less side effects, if that is true. I've gotten so many varying stories on side effects of Taxol, I don't even know what to believe anymore.",

However, my neighbor is the pharmacy manager for a huge hospital here and she said that a lot of people get sick from the scopolomine. One thing about it though is you can take it off for awhile and put it back on later if you think you are affected by it. Also FYI, it is pretty expensive. My prescription for 4 patches was $70!",

I was told when I started Taxol in October to take B complex and B6 vitamins and also D3. The B vitamins are for neuropathy and the D3 is for calcium absorption as taxol can prevent that. I asked today if I need to continue taking all of those supplements once chemo is finished in January. I can stop the B vitamins but was told to take the D3 forever because not only does it help with the calcium absorption, it also helps to prevent recurrence of the cancer. Apparently there are proven studies about this. I'm all for anything to prevent this from coming back! Has anyone else heard this? Taxol #8 tomorrow. 4 more after that. Finished on Jan 20.

I finish on Jan 20, get a 2.5 week break, then start 6 weeks of radiation. Is the 4 week recovery you mentioned after radiation? I've lost about half of my eyebrows but lashes are still there for now. Leg hair never stopped growing, even through AC. Hair on my head is starting to grow back. It's about 1/4\" long in some places but it is colorless. My normal hair color is med/dark brown and it looks more blonde/white. I hope it does not stay that way. Although I love blonde hair, it's not me. I'd love to hear everyone's hair regrowing stories. Wishing everyone a happy 2017!",

I would be absolutely thrilled and doing the happy dance that my chemo is done if not for this new huge worry I have. I never thought I would have to have this kind of stress before treatment is even done. Funny thing is my oncologist told me just last week that I was cancer free. So why are they rushing me into a mammogram and ultrasound asap if they weren't thinking exactly the opposite with this weird line/crease thing I have. My hair is coming back too. Sides are growing faster than the top and back. Sides are dark as my hair is, top is still white/blonde. Probably turning white from all of the stress right now. MO told me that as soon as it is an inch long I can color it with a gentle product. I am saving my $$ in hopes of getting extensions put in by May. As slow as my hair grows it will be 5 years for it to be shoulder length. I'm not waiting that long.",

I couldnt even be excited about being done because I just didn't feel well. Not even for a couple weeks after. But little by little my energy improved, I had much less fatigue and even slept better at night and actually felt like doing things. This past couple of weeks or so I have felt wonderful. My 20 yr old daughter and I went on an 8 hour shopping marathon on Saturday. She was getting tired and I told her I wasn't. She said \"mom, what is WRONG with you. You're always tired\". I knew then that the chemo was finally gone. My RO confirmed this week that it takes 6 weeks to really start feeling like ourselves. You will be surprised how well you start feeling before too long.

My one year anniversary of diagnosis is on July 22. I feel like It's been a tough year, no doubt, and an experience I never want to repeat. I am starting all of my one year follow up appointments. I have to go in August and have a revision on my port scar. It did not heal the way it should and is kind of lumpy and bumpy on one end due to an infection in it shortly after I got the port out. I'm on month 4 of anastrazole. Thankfully I have had few side effects from it. The worst is insomnia. If that's all I have I'll take it. I am so sorry you are in pain from this pill. Someone I'm in touch with calls it the catch 22 pill. Damned if you take it, damned if you don't. In my opinion anything is better than chemo and that's coming from someone who had no terrible reaction to chemo except for being scared out of my mind the whole time and losing my hair. I was at the dentist today. The hygienist was was asking me about my cancer treatment. Then she says \"did you know that with chemo they poison you to within an inch of your life?\". Weeeelllllllll..........no $%&* !!!!! I told my husband and he said that I should have told her that Cytoxan is a derivative of mustard gas (it really is) and would you expect any less from something like that being pumped into your body. Good grief!!! My hair is growing but not as fast as I hoped. It is about 2 inches along everywhere but the top. That is only about an inch or a little longer. Not much to show for being 25 weeks PFC. I have not trimmed it but have had it colored twice. I was hoping for some curls when it came back but no such luck. It seems a little wavy and sticks straight out above my ears. I look like the grandpa in the old Munsters tv show. LOL. I know what you mean about some of the other boards. There is one called Hair, Hair, Hair, Another Question. You will find some familiar friends on there that went through this when we did. Lots of photos of everyone's hair growth. Gives me hope that mine may look somewhat normal some day. I'm also part of a Facebook group that is a wonderful place of caring and support. I've made some great friends on there. I even had lunch with one of them and will be meeting another this fall.

How long did the fatigue last with the Taxol? Were you able to recover between infusions, or were you constantly tired? I'm pretty worried about neuropathy. Did you ice your hands and feet? I have a friend who just finished Taxol and has it so bad in her feet she can barely walk. Thanks for sharing your experience! I love this board!",

I was reading about a couple of places who specialize in that for chemo patients and they only require your hair to be an inch long to do it. I know it is very expensive, but to me it would be worth it to have my hair back. I'd even fly out of state to one of the places if necessary. I have one more AC infusion then start Taxol. I still have about 1/4 of my hair left, it is very thin and I have not shaved it, just cut the longer part in my neck. I had AC#3 on Friday and #4 on the 21st. The nurse seemed certain that these last two infusions would take the rest of my hair, although another one said earlier and even my MO that I may not lose it all. I've never heard of anyone not losing all of their hair on AC to be honest though. And that it definitely everyone is saying will grow back on Taxol. Thoughts?",

I finished AC a couple weeks ago (thank goodness!!!) and will have my second round of Taxol this week. Did your hair start growing back at all once you were on Taxol? I've heard varying stories from others on here, from the doctors, NP's and nurses. Since we are so similar with everything, including age, I was wondering what your experience was. I did not lose all of my hair on AC. I have about 1/4 of it left. Dr. assured me it would fall out by week 3 of Taxol, yet NP said it would probably remain (and eventually start growing again) and I would have new hair starting to grow soon. I'm not sure what to think.",

When your hair first started coming back in, was it your normal hair color? I have not finished chemo yet. 4 more weeks of Taxol. But I have lots of new, very soft and fine hair growing and it seems to be growing fairly fast, which I am so happy about. Some of it is probably getting close to 1/4\". However, my normal hair is medium to dark brown and what's coming in is colorless. It's not grey (I had very little grey to start with anyway) but looks more blonde, as in very blonde. I read somewhere that new hair doesn't develop any color until later on but then I also read somewhere else that it's highly likely the hair will stay the same color it is coming in as now. What have your experiences been?",

The top of my head is still mostly bald and I have various other bald patches all over my head. The little hair I do have is very sparse and mostly grey. I had NO grey hair before chemo. I just want to cry. I could deal with the half inch of hair IF it covered my whole head. I am planning on getting extensions as soon as it is an inch long. I was hoping by the beginning of May for that, but at this rate I'm still going to be bald. I see everyone's gorgeous after chemo hair pictures. Everyone has beautiful hair covering their whole head, even when it was first coming back. I am one week into radiation and will be starting hormone blockers when I'm finished. I just read that those drugs cause hair loss, thinning and/or very slow growth. I'm afraid I'm stuck in this awful wig forever. Thoughts anyone? Sorry to be such a downer.

Not seeing much sign of either right now. I'm sick of wearing an uncomfortable wig. I'm taking biotin, using Nioxin and also putting Jamaican black castor oil on my scalp a few times a week. The hair I have now is what came in about halfway through taxol but there is nothing new coming in. I am very depressed every time I look in the mirror. We want to take a vacation in June but I refuse to go anywhere if I have to wear the wig. Who can enjoy the pool or beach with a wig or the alternative, a bald head. I am 2 weeks into radiation now and will either be taking anastrazole or letrozole when I finish at the end of March. I'd heard they both cause hair loss and I am terrified of that. Dara--I am using Nioxin products as well. I have shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment. I'd be interested in the hair density treatment you mentioned. Could you send me a photo of the bottle or an online link to it? I just looked on Amazon and they have several products that are described as a hair density treatment. Someone told me today that to make hair grow faster and thicker to shave the head after hair starts growing then let it regrow. I couldn't even shave my head when it started coming out during chemo, let alone when I'm finally getting a little hair back. Has anyone done this? Also, the same person told me that we are not to color our hair for 2 years after chemo. That's something I can't wait to do but I can't wait 2 years. Mine is coming back nowhere close to my original color and it is mostly grey. I'm trying to get the courage to post pictures of my awful looking head.

I've seen pictures of women 8 or 10 weeks PFC and they have a full head of hair close tot 2 inches long already. KB870--Thank you. I almost got brave today and went without the wig. It was HOT here (funny because it snowed last week) and I was totally convinced after several hours in the wig that I definitely won't be able to stand it when it's this hot every day. Are you going without covering your head yet? How do you even get up the courage to do that? My hair was always shoulder length, as is the wig. To go from that to an inch (or less) of hair seems pretty shocking to me. I'd love to hear how every transitioned into not covering your head when your hair started coming back.",

I also did AC and have had 10 of 12 Taxol treatments. I kept some of my original hair after AC. More of it came out at the beginning of Taxol then it stopped. About the 5th or 6th Taxol treatment I noticed the \"chicken fluff\" coming in. It looked very blonde (not grey) and was all over my head. It is now about 1/4\" long and the sides are now turning dark, which is my natural hair color. Top is still blonde. I might be the next Cruella DeVille with the two tone look. LOL. I did talk to the nurse at infusion today. She told me that real hair could start coming in at anytime, but it's usually just the fuzzy stuff for a month or two after your last chemo. Also, it could come back a totally different color and texture than it was. She told me about her aunt who had a full head of grey hair and after chemo it came back red. I read somewhere that chemo takes the pigment out of your hair for awhile. I'm hoping that is my case and it eventually all is the same color. I still have my lashes but my brows have thinned by half. I heard once they start coming back they come back fast. I'm waiting for that day. Good luck and post again about the return of your hair!",

Dr. and nurses all assured me that it would be gone after the 3rd infusion. Most people have said that hair starts growing back during Taxol. So my question is, if I can manage to keep what's left of my hair after AC #4, will that hair start growing again in addition to getting new hair once I start Taxol in early Nov.? Or is that just dead hair that will just sit there? Even though I have felt pretty yucky for a week after each infusion, I have had no side effects to speak of. I was told by one NP that I have defied the odds of AC. I'm wondering if my hair is included in that.",

I don't know if it's coincidence or not but it's after I started using the oil that I started seeing the new hair growth. It's very short but it's there and there is quite a bit, although it is fine Now for my next question, since I still have 6 rounds of Taxol to go, is the new hair I have going to fall out by the end?

I noticed new hair growing on the top first. It's strange. What's coming in there has no color so far. The sides are just now coming back and although there is no length to the hair yet, it looks like I have dark shadows on the sides that is the color of my normal hair. It's kind of hard to tell anything though because I didn't lose all my hair and I didn't shave my head. I still have some my old hair between the new hair. One of the nurse practitioners that I see told me that if it doesn't fall out by the end of Taxol, it would likely start growing again. When I wear my wig I use the old, longer hair to bobby pin the wig to. Thanks again for sharing your photos!",

Funny thing is that the hair coming in on top doesn't seem to have any color. The sides are dark like my normal hair which is about the color as yours. Myleftboob--Are you referring to Nioxin products? If so, I am already using them now, before chemo is done. As soon as I started seeing new hair I got some and I just reordered more of the scalp conditioner today. I have Nioxin shampoo and conditioner as well. Just FYI it is half the price on Amazon as it is at salons. NP told me today I could start taking biotin too if I want but she didn't think it would do any good till chemo is done. She also mentioned that the hair I had coming in now was just superficial and only fuzz. I bet to differ. It has grown double the length since I noticed it about 3 weeks ago and definitely is not fuzzy. Feels prickly like a porcupine kind of like my husbands hair when he gets a buzz cut.",

I know it's expensive, but I just want to look like myself again. My hair grows very very slow and it will be a few years until it gets back to shoulder length again. I don't want to be reminded for that long that I was a cancer patient. I called the American Cancer Society to see if they had any local resources for extensions. They basically told me they had never heard of such a thing and said they couldn't help. There is a salon in Minneapolis that specializes in chemo hair extensions but that is a very long way from here and traveling there is not feasible. I'd love to hear if anyone has any thoughts.",

This is all I have after 3 whole months and that's not counting the growth that started the last 6 weeks of chemo. I'm convinced I'll be in this stupid wig all summer. If only the top would fill in and grow! At least it's not sticking straight up on the top anymore. Was sure hoping for some curls but it's as straight as it ever was. I have noticed that there is way less grey now. I had it colored 3 or 4 weeks ago and I do not see any grey at all on the new growth since then. I am pleased with the brows and lashes. They both came back thicker and darker than before.   ",

I think the thing that I am having the hardest time with right now (although the hair loss was the absolute worst part of this whole ordeal), is that I feel normal again, I act normal but I still LOOK like a cancer patient. I never thought I'd connect myself with being a cancer patient. Even 9 months after diagnosis I still find it unbelievable that this happened to me. I'm sure we all have those feelings. I just can't get it out of my head though. I am 12 weeks PFC today, and today is 3 weeks since radiation. I am so thankful I've finished treatment, but again, I look like a cancer patient. Somehow I feel no matter how long my hair grows I will always have that image of myself now. Does it really ever go away?",

It was growing before I finished and like you it was grey--very grey in fact. It was awful because I only had a few strands of grey before but that 's it. I had it colored in March as soon as I got the OK from my MO. The back and right side came in nicely before the left side. The top is still very thin and very short. But the interesting thing is that in the month since I had it colored I know it has grown and I see no more grey coming in. Not even the roots. I am happy for that. If you scroll back a few pages I have posted photos of my hair progress all along. Today marks 13 weeks PFC. It's not growing near fast enough for me and I don't dare go without a wig but it's definitely better than it was at first. I'm still pretty disappointed in it and think it looks awful as I figured I would have much more than this by now. 13 weeks is a long time. This is what it looks like now.  ",

Bareclaws--you share my same sentiments about this subject. When we finish treatment we are still paying the price by continuing to have to live our lives without hair. We may feel normal but still look like a cancer patient. I was shopping with my sister yesterday. I saw someone in the store I knew. I intentionally went to the far back corner of the store to avoid having her speak to me. I don't want to answer anybody's stupid and insensitive questions or hear the same old platitude of \"oh it's just hair, it'll grow back, just be patient\". I'm so SICK of hearing that. I've been without my hair for almost 7 months now. I've been plenty patient I think. I've been poked and poisoned with chemo, I've been fried with radiation, the emotional side of this diagnosis has been more than I can handle. The least we could have after all of this is our hair back so we can at least have a little bit of self confidence and dignity back. I'm humiliated to just look in the mirror let alone have anyone else see me like this. When I was first diagnosed I was very close to not agreeing to do chemo because of this exact reason. I didn't want to lose my hair. I've cried about that more than any other thing. My hair grows very slow the way it is. I told my hair dresser in the beginning that it would be at least 5 years until it got back to shoulder length again. I'm pretty sure I will be right on that. I wanted to get extensions. I was told that I only needed an inch of hair to do it. When it was getting close to an inch long I inquired again. I was told it was almost long enough but nowhere thick enough. About half of my scalp shows through the little hair I do have. I hate hats. I have 3 wigs. 2 of them human hair. All of them look fake, are super uncomfortable and are very obvious. I wouldn't dream of a scarf on my head. Summer is coming and it's hot here. I feel like I'm stuck inside because I'm not fit to be seen in public. People stare, people are cruel, and people are just plain rude. I have low self esteem to start with and this has made it 100 times worse. I told my family if I went through with chemo I was going to come out of it looking like a bald headed freak. That's exactly how I feel. I don't mean to sound so negative or be venting about this again but this truly how I feel. I just want to be me and that is definitely not happening in my current state. Dara--Im having the same problem as you of having to reset my password every time I log on here. I find myself not getting on here as often as I'd like just for that reason. I have reported this to the moderators numerous times over the past several months and they are saying they are unable to recreate the problem on their end thus not able to find a solution.",

I noticed just today that my hair feels a lot coarser and kind of wiry although it is still on the fine side if that makes sense. It's definitely not my normal hair. When I saw the PA for the RO last week she asked about my hair. I told her it was on average an inch long--some places longer, some shorter. She said that when I come back in 6 months I will have 2 inches of hair. Only an inch more in 6 months--I hope not. I do not have one single curl or wave.

I haven't left the house without the wig. I'd love to go without it but my main fear is running into someone I know then having to explain everything to them as to why my hair looks like it does. I went to a Look Good Feel Better class today. I was the only one who was not brave enough to take off the wig. Everyone else was sitting there bare headed but me. I felt very awkward and I still don't look good and definitely don't feel better. As you said, this is not an intentional hair style but how to transition from the wig to nothing is something I just don't know the answer to. I can't keep wearing this thing through the summer but don't feel like I can go without it either. I see this as a huge problem. I don't have much self confidence anyway and this surely isn't helping.",

It comes in several different shades and washes out. The only down fall to it is that it is a little messy to use but it covers well and exactally matches my natural hair color.",

Had to take a short road trip at the beginning of the week and there was no way I was going to wear the uncomfortable skull crushing wig so I went without. My dad told me I need to keep my hair this way, that he liked it. Fat chance!!! I'm going today to get it colored and to see if it can be trimmed into somewhat of a style although there's not much to work with. Will post photos later. The wig has been my security blanket but quite honestly it was starting to look and feel very unnatural, even though it was human hair. My own hair still looks pretty bad in my opinion but although short, it's my own hair and my head is no longer bald. Going on vacation in a week and a half. Very excited to get away and think about something besides cancer for once.",

Thankfully it was nothing but I did find out I have to have back surgery next week to fix a problem that was found in one of the MRI's I had. The fun just never ends.

The color might even make individual hairs thicker. I was hoping to have some curls, but no such luck. The sides lay flat against my head and the top sticks straight up. I had very curly hair as a kid, but it's been stick straight ever since. My MO even told me it would come back curly but I'm not seeing it. I know what you mean about the steroids! For the last 12 weeks of my chemo I never slept on a Friday night because of them. And it was strange for about 3 weeks after chemo was done that I still didn't sleep on Friday nights.

Mine is nowhere close to being presentable let alone gorgeous. I'm starting to regret doing chemo. I won't dare go out of the house without a wig (even to the back yard or to take out the trash) and when I have it off at home I keep all the doors and blinds shut so nobody outside can get a glimpse of me. In public I feel so self conscious of myself in the wig and sit in the darkest corner of a restaurant and I avoid anyone I recognize in a store. Sad but true. Our vacation is in a couple months. I agreed to booking it with the condition that my hair is presentable enough to go without a wig. I'm pretty sure we will be cancelling. Sorry to be a Debbie Downer tonight but I never dreamed that this part of the cancer experience would be so miserable. It has by far been the absolute worst part.",

I put it on at night but have to wear a cap to bed to keep the oil off of the pillow. But my problem is I cannot stand anything on my head, hats in particular, so I don't put it on that often because when I wear a hat to bed then I don't sleep. Not sure if there is a way to resolve that issue and I know it's a weird hang up of mine. I'm wondering if I should even bother with the oil when I'm not done with chemo yet. What do you think? I finished AC and have had 4 treatments of Taxol with 8 weeks to go. 5 months of chemo is a LONG time. So many people say their hair comes back on Taxol.

I had no scans or anything in the beginning--just mammogram, ultrasound and the biopsy. I had surgery in August and had clean margins. I did AC/Taxol chemo and just finished 20 of 30 rounds of radiation. Radiation will be finished on March 25. A week ago I had a series of 6 different blood tests. The normal blood work, CBC and metabolic panel that they did before each chemo. There was one to check my vitamin D levels and one to determine menopause, which will be used to determine which hormone blocker I have to take. The last 2 tests were to check the tumor markers. I never had tumor marker tests to start with but both tests now had results that were in the normal range of no cancer in my body. I also had a breast exam. All of these things put together is what the MO used to determine that I was cancer free. She also said that the fact that I did the full treatment regimen (some people don't) also helped to determine cancer free. I will have a mammogram in August and the tumor marker tests will be repeated as well as the CBC and metabolic panel to monitor that the readings are still similar to what they were last week. She did say that some oncologists do not use the tumor marker tests to make any determinations. I think depending on the stage and grade of the cancer other scans are done but according to my dr. they are not standard practice unless there is a need for them.",

It doesn't look like it in the photos, but the top and sides for sure. the back is darker but at this point I'm not too hopeful that the rest will change to that color. I have an appointment next week to have it colored. That will take care of the grey. I don't know if anything will take care of making it thicker. I use Nioxin products and take a hair, skin and nail supplement with biotin. Not sure what else I can do. I'm so sorry there are so many of us in the same boat here. We go through all of this to get rid of the cancer and the best reward would be if we got to keep our hair. Hopefulyogi--I just wonder if we'll ever get our color back. My hair is about an inch long on the crown of my head (it sticks straight up and is starting to look like a troll) as well as the right side and the lower back. The rest varies from still bald to a half inch or so. Very depressing. ",

I know nothing about essential oils though, although I know they are a very popular thing right now. She mentioned rosemary, clary sage and cedarwood specifically. I called a salon who I remembered reading sold an oil mixture for hair. They said theirs had lavender, sage, rosemary, peppermint and \"several other oils\" in it.

Mistyeyes--I was using the castor oil too, even before I was done with chemo. I used it every night or every other night for 3 or 4 months. I did not notice any difference at all. My hair dresser told me that too much of the castor oil will clog the pores and do more harm than good so I quit using it. And besides, my husband wouldn't get close to me when I had it on. He hated the smell. I talked to the nurse in my MO's office yesterday. She said that the chemo drugs stay in our bodies for 1-2 months minimum and that hair can't truly grow until it is completely out of our system. This is week 10 PFC for me and I actually think mine has stopped growing or is possibly falling out again because of the hormone blocker I've been taking for the last couple of weeks.

I tested a tiny area of hair right by my temple. Good thing I tried it first. That little bit turned bright orange. I called my hair dresser and asked her to color it professionally. I told her what happened and she said that the developer I used was not a high enough volume. I used 20. She said I needed 10. That's what she used and it came out fine. No orange, but it was much lighter than the color she used. She put on some kind of a glaze and it was perfect. One thing I've noticed is that the color has not lasted as long as it should. I had this done 3 weeks ago today and I can already see lots of fading and some grey showing through again.",

Everyone I talk to (and I still try to avoid as many people as possible) keep telling me I should keep it this way. Are you kidding me?! I can barely stand to look in the mirror. I realized tonight that it has been 7 months yesterday that I finished chemo. I was positive I'd have at least 3 or 4 inches of hair by now. No such luck. The only thing I am happy about is that I am starting to get some curls/wave. My mom said she wishes she had my hair. She can have it!! I have to start back to physical therapy on Wednesday. I now apparently have radiation induced fibrosis. Great! One more thing to deal with. I was doing great until mid June. I started having some pain in the lymph node removal area and down the underside of my arm. It's to the point where it hurts to raise my arm above my head. They said it is caused by fibrous tissue formed during healing from radiation which I finished at the end of March. So again, the gift that keeps on giving. Just what we don't need. Hang in there Lyn. The end is in sight.",

I did not lose all of my hair during chemo and I also had AC/Taxol. I was just looking at some pictures tonight and saw some from the end of chemo. I still had some, but not much, old hair left and by about the middle of taxol new hair was growing back. Best wishes to you.",

Everyone tells me to leave it this short but I'm not so sure just yet. Exactly a year ago I was overwhelmed with the thought of starting chemo on Sept 9. Losing my hair was my biggest fear. I always looked at everyone's hair growth pictures on here and was green with envy. I never thought I would ever get to the point of posting pictures of my own hair growth. For those of you who are where I was a year ago, I hope this gives you some encouragement that your hair will come back, slowly but surely. Definitely never fast enough though. ",

This has been very hard for me. The top and front are only half as long as the back and sides and the top is quite thin. I have no bangs. I still have a meltdown frequently when looking in the mirror or when I am trying to dress up and look nice then I have hair that I can do nothing with. I know that sounds vane and whiny but this has been a tough one to handle. I am not sure what chemo you had but I remember reading somewhere that people who had AC chemo first then Taxol (or some other drug) afterwards usually start growing their hair back midway or so during the second regimen. And those who receive the same regimen throughout treatment take longer to see hair regrowth. Not sure if there's any truth to that but in my case, I did have AC first then sure enough, midway through Taxol the white fuzz was growing. Hang in there--your hair is coming.",

I was very surprised as I expected the same as you. Even through Taxol that same bit remained. Mostly on the back of my head. I could not bring myself to shave it though. By the time I was about half finished with Taxol I had new hair growing so I trimmed off the long strands of the old hair. I am now 34 weeks from my last chemo. I have about 3 inches of thick curly hair now. Loving the curls but not loving how slow it is growing. Good luck to you.",
