Biotin is necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. It plays a role in the Citric acid cycle, which is the process by which biochemical energy is generated during aerobic respiration. Biotin not only assists in various metabolic reactions, but also helps to transfer carbon dioxide. Biotin is also helpful in maintaining a steady blood sugar level. Biotin is often recommended for strengthening hair and nails. Consequently, it is found in many cosmetic and health products for the hair and skin. Biotin is widely distributed in a variety of foods, but most often at low concentrations. Estimates are that the typical U.S. diet provides roughly 40 mcg/day. There are only a couple of foods which contain biotin in large amounts, including royal jelly and brewer's yeast. The best natural sources of biotin in human nutrition are swiss chard, tomatoes, romaine lettuce, and carrots. Other great sources include almonds, eggs, onions, cabbage, cucumber, and cauliflower. And good sources includes goat's milk, cow's milk, raspberries, strawberries, halibut, oats, and walnuts. The most important natural sources in feeding nonruminant animals are oilseed meals, alfalfa, and dried yeasts. It is important to note that the biotin content of food varies and can be influenced by factors such as plant variety, season, and yield...  So there you go girls.. your hair growth diet! ",

Eat lots of yummy fruit, and try my fave yogurt recipe when you are craving sweets. 1 part oatmeal, 1 part fruit( fresh or frozen), 2 parts plain (unsweetened, no gelatin or starch in it)yogurt layered in a bowl in that order. Let sit a few hours or overnight. Sweeten with brown sugar or maple syrup or a little honey to taste. Throw in some slivered almonds and it is a perfectly balanced meal or snack. I am tired.

Lest I turn this into the MOJO thread I'll only share as much as you guys can handle, so let me know when you want more positions. I don't have rads burns, so I can lie on my Mast side now without too much trouble.  This position is not that complicated, it might test your hip flexibilty but it can work. Lying on your sides face to face( keep in mind foreplay was quick on this one as we had not seen each other in a week) Chest to chest. The reason this worked well with no boob on the bed side was that he could get his bent arm up closer to my flat chest and up to my face and neck. The lower half part was that I had my upper leg bent and up high enough to allow for penetration( I warned you on the hip flexibility thing but if you lean back a little you can make it work) Also, because of the no boob side he could be really close to that side and lean up on his arm and kiss my other breast while still keeping hip to hip contact. Make sense?? Try it anyway! You' have fun trying. Most of our other positions are spoon-like with him behind or the X position. These are both how we did it when the mast side was too sore for me to lie on it. The other day a female friend (who is under 30, and not too experienced) who has bruised ribs was complaining that sex was too difficult. We told her that if we could find positions 5 days after my surgery that did not hurt me then we are sure she can work through sex with bruised ribs. In an hour I turn 42. I got My best Birthday gift already! I got to talk to Rock!!!!! I realized, like with talking to Kristy a few weeks ago... that through all of this none of this has made the step to make plans to talk on the phone with each other!  I think we could have talked for about 3 days! Ladies, I am looking soooo forward to getting to know each and every one of you... in person, on the phone, on FaceBook or wherever we meet.... it is one more step to normal, but as we have said...

On Tuesday night my flight was crazy delayed as many of you know.  I packed and I had Herceptin, and on my way to the airport was told my flight was cancelled and got onto a later flight.  I got into JFK at 11ish and took a cab( at jeanne's insistence) and met her at a bar near where she lives and where I was staying... we talked from midnight until 3 am... despite her apologies about the bar being smelly and her fave bartender not being there to give us cheap drinks we had a lot of fun. It really was like a live episode of The Road to Hell thread.. and anyone without BC would have been bored out of their minds... but we bitched and moaned and compared notes about everything from diagnosis nightmares( Happy Anniversary everyone!) ( don't forget, I was not on this thread from the beginning so I did not know about Rock's diagnosis mess) to hot flashes to sore fingers. It was very cathartic, but we were catatonic with exhaustion and finally did the grown up thing and went home at 3am. I bought groceries( my friend's apartment is always clean and has no food!) and went home and read my self to sleep. I slept most of Wednesday and hung out with my best friend and had a late dinner with other friends. Rock had her dentist appt and found out about the need for the crown. That is when we realised trying to both be available to be with Karin on Thursday was not going to work. We were bummed. On Thursday we planned to try and get together, but it took until Midnight for both of us to be free again. We met at another bar, talked until that place shut down and then moved to another. This time we talked more about family and how our years unfolded with regards to cancer. We cried together when Rock thanked me for coming and how great it was to be with someone who has been through this whole mess. My foob was hurting my scar, and realised I could just reach into my bra and take the damn thing out! If I could not do that in front of you all then who else??We talked until 4 am and decided since we both has full days on Friday we better stop.  Miss Jeanne is amazing to watch.She has the most hilarious rubber face! Every joke, every story has a mood and an expression that shoots out of her... she really talks like she writes to us on here! She is warm and beautiful and we are each very lucky to have her here. You may not realise, but it is because of her writing on the Road to hell thread that made me pop in to the May thread to see what was up with you guys.... and without her I would not have found many of you. I am so glad I decided to make the last minute trip to New York and I wish i could have brought all of you with me. Karin, I have loved chatting with you this week, and am truly sorry we could not work things out.   Soon ladies... soon.  Love to all. Kristy glad u are home and ok... RanD, we talked about u in New York... we wonder and we worry..  xoxN",

He said that at 1 year from surgery if I have had no lymphodema ( which I haven't) symptoms the chances are low that I will get them now. He said I shouldn't maybe consider a career as a body builder but other than that he has no concerns. He also wondered why I had been concerned about flying when I mentioned it. The studies I have read agree with him. The people at LiveStong suggested I check out lymphnet.org.   I am calling my trainer tomorrow to book some weight sessions.  As for the FB stuff. You only allow new people to see your partial profile if you reply to an email from them. Your Facebook settings are as strict as you set them, and Facebook shows a popup to warn you if anything could change if you click. You should only be getting hugs and gifts from people you have already voluntarily added to your friends list. Tonight I got to meet some BBC/Canadian TV celebrities at a trade show. Have any of you seenthe British(Scottish) to be specific Home Makeover show designers Colin and Justin?  They have had many shows on BBC over the years and have moved to Canada and have a show here now. I \"friended\" them on FB last year and started emailing them on a whim and occasionally get an email from them. One of their mom's has cancer( not sure which type) and I occasionally send a note about that. Today I told them I was going to be at a presention of theirs and they told me to be sure to say hello. I waited for the throng of women to stop fauning all over them and told Justin who I was and he about lost his mind! He called his assistant over to bring a book over for me. They had written a lovely note in their new book as a gift to thank me for being concerned with Justin's mom. He was so genuine and lovely I was taken aback. They were very very busy with hundreds of women but stopped everything to talk to me! I loved it! Love to all.. I have been thinking about Deb all day... ",

I am just reading Lance Armstrongs book \"Its not about the bike\" and just finished the bit about his year after chemo was over and his fears and such. A short and easy read, get the book it already makes me feel stronger.. ! I am just  decided  to head into genetic testing ( my granny had a double mast with no biopsies 30 years ago so we don't know...) and have been thinking about the other side coming off too and recon and soy in my damned oatmeal mix etc.    I am ER- but I can just as easily get another breast cancer that is ER+  down the line. All of this is freaky. I say tearful and down is the way we build ourselves back up to being strong the next day. It sounds cliche but without down there can be no up. Weep your heart out, snap out of it and move on. I swear, it is productive.  That said, my superpowers are all yours. I am an X-men team member after all. My first BC haircut (the white mohawk for those of you who recall) was a nod to \"Storm\"  the 80's version and the white wig is a nod to the millenium version.   Smile everyone!

That is what my Dad tells people I got. I was on financial aid at the one of the best schools in the US ( thank god for being a non-white female international student, 'cause god knows my marks did not get me into the place) and had no clue how to cope academically so screwed it all up and got myself booted out of the place by failing out (I call it dropping out now, because in hindsight I realise I must have made some sub concious choices to make it happen)   I think what you are doing is awesome! I hate the mess the gov has made of teaching here and wish my kid had someone like you in the classroom!  Otter, i have a mast bra and it is better then any homemade thing I have had. Regular bras with stuff stuffed in them was not working because of the fit of the band and such.What i do not get is why the prosthetic has to be so damned heavy. It hurts my scar, it hurts my shoulder it is stupid! I am an perky A cup so having a pound of rubber on the one side is totally foreign. My proth is an adhesive one  ( what a riot to have a stick on boob, let me tell ya) but they say it is too soon to wear it that way with such a new scar) Don't even get me started on finding a mast bathing suit for competitive swimming! NOT one of the companies that makes suits for athletes make a mast suit. Somehow doing a triathlon in a Sears or Lands End mast suit will not seem right.   Today I had someone ( a total stranger who knows me through my store and such) ask me \"how are you doing\" and I said well chemo finished a week ago so it will be sometime until I feel normal again but today is a good day. She asked again \"but you are fine now?\" I gave her some answer but it upset me a lot. I was standing there bald, and clearly lopsided in my tank top a week out of chemo and some stranger wants me to tell them that I am healthy???? WTF???? Yes dear Library stranger lady, my boob grows back a little each day, just like my hair and those cool doctors cured me with that magic medicine. It was just like the vacation really! I thought I would gain 20 lbs while I was there!  It was up there in my top 5 most annoying encounters with people, and upset a lot!    Today, I am trying to think of the pat answer for people, because clearly I am going to get this question a lot.  I want my answer to be not impolite ( I will have to use it ih the store ) but enough to the point to make them GET IT and shut the F * up and never ask such an insensitive question again.   GRRRR! Chemooooooo!!!!  Noelle  ",

I did not know about the B complex until this week, but I am going to get some anyway, I used to take it for energy years ago. Here is a question for everyone. Is anyone else that has gained weight noticing that a lot of the gain is only in the belly? I assumed it was the steroids and water weight from that and maybe from the menopause symptoms. My Doc said all my gain is from inactivity, and maybe only a little from steroids. But, since I hate her now after all the bad info/ held back info I don't trust that she gets it at all. When I look in the mirror, I see a body that looks more pregnant than fat, does that make sense? ( there is fat in lots of other places, don't get me wrong but...) I am just trying to navigate around having this other persons body and what to do with it. OK as for the Chocolate banana bread. Someone gave it to me, and it was bought at a bakery i think, i will ask. It was really just a banana bread with chocolate chips thrown in. Too bad we don't all live close, we could have a contest! I am going to try the Fanny Farmer banana bread recipe with semi sweet chips. In this part of Canada women really don't bake. No, I am not kidding. I make muffins and bring them to the neighbours and they act like I brought them gold. I make my kids birthday cakes and the other mommy's tell me I am making them look bad.

Guilty for invading your group, but mostly guilty for being finished with chemo before most of you. Dumb, I know but I felt like I was being sent home from summer camp early and I was missing the closing campfire.  2 weeks into my stay at 'Camp Recovery' I can tell you the emotional stuff is a rollercoaster. Not what I expected, and I am still digging for info about how to handle the petty stuff...the weight gain, bloating,  nail damage etc etc etc. There is not much info about this stage. Today is the longest I have been without chemo since this crap all started. I spent a good part of the afternoon crying and angry because now everyone is expecting me to bounce back right away. Or maybe that is just me expecting that, and I am misreading what other people are saying. wheee! I always hated Rollercoasters dammit! Rock, I am glad you got to hang out with pals and have fun.

Having my body adjust to the lack of chemo, and my son's day camp schedule all in the same week has been a lack of sleep hell.  HOLD PLEASE! Just had a hot flash and had to stick my head over the A/C vent. OK, as for weight gain. The book I am reading, and the other info I have say that the bloating/ weight gain= hormone wackiness from the chemopause which is caused from the chemo killing our egg production AND the steroids AND the lack of exercise/ bad eating AND the chemo slows the metablism down.  So we have everything against us in that dept.   The good news? At chemo end+17 days I have been able to work 6-7 hour shifts on my feet as long as I eat regularly I can keep my energy up. I can work out lightly. My feet and hand tingle less and less everyday. I have lost about 6 inches in my hips and waist. My weight is all over the place depending on the time of day, but how I feel and how clothes fit is all that I think is impoortant.  Sue and everyone gaining waight- weight gain from medical reasons is far more depressing than normal everyday weight gain. Once this is all over I will give you my eating plan/ exercise plan that helped me lose 45 lbs in '02. I quit smoking, had a baby became a single parent,and moved in with my mom at 32. So a slower metabolism and depression made me eat a lot!  I had always been tiny, so I had never gained weight before, so when I hit 155 at 5\"1 it was a bit of a shock. So I had to learn a whole new lifestyle. This is the best time of year to start it. For now, eat as well as you can and don't worry too much.   Rock, my son wears Husky sizes, I actually have to go to US websites to get them.For some reason I cannot get them here.Canadian shopping really is a train wreck in my opinion.I remember being a 6x when I was 6... i thought it was very neat.   Yesterday I managed a 2km( 1mile) walk, my tingly feet were a little ouchy but I did it. I planned to wear a hat or scarf to catch the sweat. It is official, I made the right decisionto go bald  through this whole chemo thing. I went in to do the payroll before my workout in a baseball cap and my staff said I looked like a 6 year old boy with cancer ( nod to Rock and the Pam incident posted on Road to hell...) I thought it was fun being a 6x when I was a little girl!  But, a flat chested 6 year old boy is not a look /disguise I want at 41! I am off to a quiet day of housework, gardening and stuff.  I general shout out of chemooo! to y'all. Noelle    P.S. Once I took myself off the hardcore heartburn meds I have been on since day 1 of A/C I lost  a lot of the bloating too.",

I am mentally and emotionally a new person....and physically after almost 6 weeks chemo free I am still feeling odd.  But, dear Ladies, feeling odd is far better than felt during chemo  N   P.S. but if one more \"normal\" asks me what I am going to change because I got cancer then violent may be part of my new normal. I am working at the response \" oh, I plan to start smoking again, drinking more and start sleeping with 24 year olds\"  ",

I have been AWOL for 24 hours and very little writing has happened.  Chris- well that totally sucks, but we will be waiting for you and Gracie.   RanD, I love to bake too, I use it for stress relief mostly. For some reason I barely bake during chemo though. I have made my raspberry jam, and have damson plum jam at the ready (had a bad recipe, so I had to put it in the fridge and get more plums)  My mom left none of her recipes for me... and I am making a lot of stuff up as I go along to try and match her jams. I am going to try moms recipe( we forced her to write this one down) for Betsy Ross pickles next week.  I was at the Toronto Exibition ( a huge late summer country fair/ amusement park) after I finished on TV yesterday morning. So, I got up at 4:30 (remember I am a terrible night owl) after 3 hours sleep and was on TV for 3 hours, had a 1/2 hour nap and went to the EX with my ds and his friend and spent $200 on junk food and teaching the two 9 year old why the games of chance never really work and almost no one wins the BIG stuffed animals...you should have seen their faces when the carnie told them he would guarantee they won the big toy they coveted if they spent $80 on games..... my ds got quite depressed by it all. My bf came for dinner time and took him on some rides that the other boy would not go on...  All in all it was a day for the kids and I stood in the cold wind ( the EX is next to Lake Ontario and it was a slightly rainy day) getting stared at by the normals. I had the leftovers of my TV makeup on, so I at least had some version of eyebrows.  I walked for almost 7 hours with them, and today I am wiped!!! God knows I could not have done all that walking while on chemo, so I am happy I could make my kids summer dream of spending a day like this with mom come true. Truthfully, I was worried I would not be able to walk that much and I would have to make them take breaks.     My fingernails are officially toast. The top third of all but one thumb are totally separated from the nailbed, but the upcoming growth looks healthy. I think this must mean that the damage was done quite a while ago. I have to find out how long it takes for nails to show damage. The info on this site says many chemos can do it, so could it have been theA/C and not the Taxol??   I am scared to take the polish off my toes.   chemooooo to all in treatment/ S/E land and big hugs to everyone else!

I hope and pray for your moms sake and for the sake of everyone that loves her that you find a happy peaceful way to be together and do or say what is needed to each other. My mom and I hung out a lot in her last few weeks( I was lucky,she was right downstairs. She bought this little house to die in, and my son and I would have a place to live while I was working on making my business successful)  we laughed, we planned, we even faught. She planned her own funeral down to the music (which my Dad played) and the menu for the \"Roast and Toast\" afterwards. In the last few days I forced the docs to keep her pain free and as lucid as possible. It went as well as could be hoped for.  I wish the same for you and your family.  Ruby, you are in my prayers.

I have videos to share, products to suggest etc. No detergents, No silcone, No petroleum. It is the only way to live as a curly girl. Believe me, I have tried it all!  The ONLY reason I sell face and hair care is because my customers pestered me to. I only wanted to carry prods for the body. Anything from the neck up women are VERY fussy about and I was not interested in fighting to win any share of those buying dollars. Annoyingly, since my skin and hair are visible to my customers if they like what they see they ask me what I use. So ultimately I started selling what I use and became my own living breathing freakin' commercial.  oops, I was supposed to be taking about curly hair, not about my dilemma with being the only one that can actually really sell anything in my store. I could go on forever about my arrogant assistant blah blah.

I am quite sure I have never allowed a cat, or even most humans to be so much MINE as this baby kitten was...

I guess I have not been following along well.  Cris, I am a child of divorce except that I was a mostly formed adult in my early 20's when it happened. I don't really believe anyone can get out unscarred and guilt and nastiness come out of the best people. My parents were married for 25 years and basically never fought. My Dad cheated, my mother became a venomous, horrible, betrayed human and remained so for another 16 years or so until she died. They found some peace when Grandchildren and cancer came into our lives. He knows he was a complete fecking idiot and she was the best thing he ever had, when we buried her ashes soon after chemo he said that in his dreams  he is still married to her-yes, I think he is a GIANT ass for saying/ feeling so... mostly because during the mediations/ divorce etc his actions were so horrid, and he acted like he had done nothing wrong. I guess what I am saying is stop trying to see logic in his actions. He is temporarily insane and will do/ say anything to keep himself and everyone else from seeing that. As we have seen with chemo etc live gutting experiences like cancer, can get so deeply into your subC that it takes years to work out what you were thinking during it... and even more to work out how deeply it affected you (shout out to Kristy at the wedding, yes, I've been there too). I know divorce is not the same as cancer, but as you say... it needs a specialized treatment too. Somehow, can you make you girls understand that grown ups/people do/say strange things under pressure ? and that their Dad misses them but does not know how to act.. and will do/say strange things because he is scared they won't like him anymore. His cheating was based on some fear and his lack of abilty to confide in you, so he found a way to make himself feel good for a moment meanwhile mangling his whole universe... it will take him a long time, if not forever to realise all this... but sadly you and your kids will pay dearly for his weakness. You, my dear have no reason to forgive him.. but somehow to keep yourself sane have to find a way to see him as weak and pathetic and not the enemy....Pick your battles, protect your girls and find the best way you can to let them see you be strong and smart... and human to yourself, to them and to him ( even though we all know he is a giant ass) Sorry for the babble, but does this make sense?

Mom and Dad( a church organist from the age of 10) planned the service quite literally on her death bed. They had planned thousands of services and concerts together before they divorced (after 26 years) The funeral was one of the best 'concerts' they had planned together and that most people there had ever attended. They handpicked the choir and the clergy and held it late enough in the day so everyone could attend. No one realised that it would be dark by part way through the service(since she died in late November) so most of it was in candlelight. Mom was Scottish, so we had a local bagpiper pipe the pall bearers out to the hearst and we all stood on the lawn watching the car pull away. Mom picked the menu (down to how the chicken was to be prepared and that there must be kosher for our orthodox friends) for the after party, and recorded her own farewell video. We were instructed by her on the video to get a drink to toast her life. She made us promise that the Scotch would be flowing throughout the party.  2 years later I still have Scotch leftover, although my siblings and guests tried very hard to drink it all! In about 2 weeks we will finally get to bury her ashes( that is another looong story)   I have to help my DS with late night homework. More later!   Love to all! ",

The best way to buy shoes is to go to a reputable sports/ running store and ask about the best shoes for what sport and get something that fits well. Everyones feet fit diff brands differently. For example I have high arches and run mostly trails, so my shoe choice is diff from many runners. Jean and Linda??   ok, so the stupid doc finally called with a pathetic excuse for an apology. The nurse was supposed to call me with test results B4 the heart scan department called with the second heart scan test info. My baseline heart function was 55-57 in August, now it has dropped to 50. All of these numbers are in the \"normal\" range but a drop is cause for \"caution\" so they are testing me again. The protocol for Herceptin stoppage is a drop of 15 or more, so I could do my next Herceptin on the 24th and the next heart test on Dec 5th and still likely be safe/ok (or perhaps drop to 49.... WTF?) So, since I was hoping to have my Herceptin on the 24th in the morning, so we could finally bury my mom's ashes on the 2 year anniversary of her death in the afternoon I decided to postpone the scan until after the next Herceptin. So, now I have 3 weeks with no Hospital visits. I thought it was idiotic to have more Herceptin until after the scan. Worst case scenario? If the heart still keeps dropping then we can stop, let the heart recover(Herceptin damage to the heart is not neccesarily permanent) and then they can start again.  So, I get the 24th free to bury Mom's ashes and get that FINALLY taken care of. It is a long story why it did not happen b4, but it was all about Money and Timing, and since she requested a plot in a section of a cemetary that was not open yet we held off... and then I got cancer.   Wheee!  N     ",

Sore bodies yes, but nothing compared to A/C. I had the allergic reaction to Taxol tx #1. Mostly soreness and a funny throat feeling, but it was enough for them to stop it and freak out 6 nurses and a Doc.

Soy food stuffs are ok on occasion, but no supplementing with it. As for the lube thing, did you read my post on the MOJO thread about what we use? PM me if you want more info.  Or if everyone wants to know I can go on about it here too.  You and I are on the same ride when it comes to family. I am trying to let it go, but man it hurts when they don't try at all.  As you know my mom died in 06 of an unrelated cancer and I was her primary caregiver. Our relationship was rocky but got mostly forgiven during the death process. Today my BFF asked me if I missed my mom. I said sort of.... but I was glad I could hang onto the thoughts of her bringing me tea and toast when I was ill( I was rarely ever ill, but she did this when I was... those are good memories for me.) and not deal with the potential reality of her being a bitch ( which she was a lot, mostly to me, her eldest) Your mom is being selfish, and it sucks. There is no way around that, and a this time it is totally unfair to you. I don't have an answer for you, but I am going back and forth between asking my friends and family why they have not been here for me, or just movin'on and not askin'.... The thing that keeps me from askin' is that they won't 'get it'  - all they will hear is that I am being selfish and I don't understand them.....  I may still ask, but I don't expect to get the response I deserve. You asked, you did not get the response you deserved and maybe crying a little and movin' on is the best you can do... for now. As for the arm, how much physio did you do if any? I would bring you tea and toast any day... really I would.  Noelle  ",

Then I had another person with a type of lymphoma who has seen me on TV, and after she paid for her soap she gave me a BC t-shirt that she said \"I bought this for myself, but will never wear it- so i thought you should have it\"   Theeeeen I had another woman who had curly hair from chemo, but insisted on arguing with me about her hair for about 20 minutes (I am a pain in the ass about curly hair when people argue with me, I warn them from the beginning of the demo/sales pitch and I always win every argument they throw at me)  It was an interesting day.   I think I won the fight with fedex and will have my shipment tomorrow.   I never got to the mailing list.  I was thinkin' about you 3 chemo ladies all day, I hope things went well.   More later after I eat.  xoN",

It is amazing how much stuff was left undone during chemo. Last night the cat puked on the same stairs as my DS.   Ok, so here is the puke story. Friday night my DS was drinking juice( like frozen from concentrate fruit punch) very thirsty and drank most of 2 cups. He went to bed and left the cup with a little in it on the coffee table) I was watching TV and was thirsty, so grabbed the cup for a sip instead of getting up. BLECH!!!! The juice had gone off and I spit back into the cup. I checked on the kid and he was fast asleep. Man, I was thinking, kids have iron stomachs( and no taste buds clearly)    FF to the morning and he wakes up and says his burps taste yucky. I said oh, it is likely from the juice and I tell him the story about it being off. He gets this look and asks what happens if you drink bad juice.... and proceeds to start complaining about his stomach. Keep in mind I have a very good actor for a child who can make a crust of bread issue seem like the end of the world. So I offer to get him a Tums and then he races upstairs saying he is going to puke. I follow, and sadly for me he does not get to the bathroom in time and pukes fermented red juice all over the walls and carpet on the stairs and pukes more into the toilet. After cleaning him up he is perfectly fine. I am already late for meeting the staff to pack for the festival, so we mop up the puke as best as possible and we leave. I always hated the light coloured carpet on those stairs anyway, so now with the huge burgundy stains on it I think it really has to go.   I am desperately trying to not work much this month- having no chemo, no kid, and no major side effects and a slow store mean a few weeks of peace for me.... but NOOOOOO! I seem to always have too much work to do for the store to get any real chunks of time for myself. We are booking a trip to VT for Canadian Thanksgiving in mid Oct though.   I hope everyone has a day with some joy in it. I will carry you with me through mine.  Cheers and Chemoooo to those in the throws of it!  N",

I occasionally show up at a birthday party with one, and shock people because no one knows I can do it, but I mostly just bake for myself and my kid.  I am suuuuper fussy about desserts after doing it such for a long time, so I rarely eat any unless I am somewhere being polite.  Cris- My hands ache from wrist to fingertips. It is nothing like they did during the taxol, it isn't tingly really but man does it hurt.  I had a customer today whose dad has long term neuropathy from chemo and what I described is what her dad has in his feet. During Taxol my fingertips tingled and it felt funny/ ouchy to touch stuff, this feels like I imagine arthritis would feel. I will call my onco nurse, but since they sucked about side effect info all the way through chemo I cannot imagine what they will say now.  Jean, I hope you and mom are doing ok. Eddie, you know we are all with you.   Jen- your pic is awesome,  I will find some pic to contribute I guess.   Rock- I wanna be in NYC too. I need a Reuben from Katz's deli, a Mochaccino from Cafe Reggio,  and a bed in the Hotel Chelsea and all will be right with the world.  I am making plum jam and better go stir it.   xo and chemooo to all N",

I may not get into the magazine, but we had to take the shot at it. The BF wanted me to bail on it because my week is so nuts. 2 trips to the Hospital for bloodwork and then Herceptin, and a looong 7 day work week with this summer fest we are doing this weekend he was worried I was overstretched. Well call me Stretch Armstrong 'cause I am in day 4 of work( today was a 12 hour day) the medical crap is done and we are almost ready for the next three nutty days.   I'll post some of the after shots on my blog and my facebook account.  As for the skin advice, my questions to all my customers about their skin care (Face and Body) issues start with  \" How often are you exfoliating?\"  Answer me that, and I will take you through the steps to get you the best skin you have ever had. Chemoooo and happy days everyone! I will be scarce this weekend, but carrying you all with me.   N",

Ok, Here is step one of the secret.  You MUST exfoliate head to toe at least 3 times a week.You are wasting your money on lotion etc if you are not exfoliating. The lotion will happily moisturize the dead skin cells on the surface and not sink into the new skin that needs the moisture. I will go into more detail later.  Here is your job for the weekend, look at the labels on your products for two ingredients that are evil.  Any ingredient ending in Sulphate, and any ingredient ending in paraben.  You will be shocked by how many things you own have these things in them. Don't throw them away yet, I will teach you more about them later too.  Chemooo!  ",

BF was in the caf getting lunch and came up to find 8 zillion nurses swooping and diving around me. Rock and Otter- peace and good health for your mommies ASAP! In the SITC movie I cheered when Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) had a full frontal boob scene! Cynthia was very private about her BC until it was all over and I was sooo excited to see that she was cool with the nudity! There were a lot of lonely years when my kid was little and I was single and building my business alone that the SITC girls were my bestest friends. The movie was like a college reunion for me-I missed them all so much! Yesterday an old pal who swoops in rarely but at perfect times into my store to say hi popped in to chat.I can always count on her cynisism and understanding of how much I hate the dumb crap people say to me at the store. So, in your best overly nasal Roseanne Rosanna Danna Danna voice say: \"YOU LOOK GREAT!!!!! YOU MUST BE ALL CURED!!!!!\" and you'll get the kinda stuff she says to make me laugh.   I met another friend who just finished a lumpectomy and rads. She is my age, her mom had BC and asked to have a mammo (they do not routinely do them here until you are 50)and they found a teeny lump, and got it dealt with really early. She feels great, and is prepping for a 25 km race in October. She is my inspiration to keep my goal of doing the mini tri ( an hour-ish to complete) at the end of August. I am fully prepared not to make the goal if I am still too tired, but I am gonna try. My legs are still really tired this week, could be from being back at the store a bit more, not sure. I am going to try and swim or go for nordic walk in the trails today. My fingetips are a mess, and the nails are starting to separate from the nail beds. I wonder if the herceptin will do them in for good.   DRUG COMPANIES SUCK! Rock, thanks for that info  Chris, I get funny shooting pains in my scar all the time, it is likely the neupagen/ neulasta(cannot recall if you take it) or possibly nerve endings trying to grow back. I make the doc  check my scar a lot because it freaks me out.   Chemooo!  Noelle    ",

The bright yellow and brown stuff that is sometimes seen is either coloured, not pure, or not cleaned properly. Jean, I will jump in the river and swim about with otter just in case you need help. I need the practice before the race.  Cheers to everyone! Boulder on a fun and safe journey and Sue on a safe flight to get the pupps Chemoooo and all that too!   Edited to add here too...  Linda I was thinking the same thing about Rads. Someone else on another board has what looks like the same dx as me, and she wanted to know why I was not getting them. Of course that made me freak out (a little) I was told that here 5cm of total tumour size meant rads, I had 3 tumours that added up to 4.9cm. I only had one micro-metastasized cell out of 17nodes removed in the lymph area, after a talk with the rad onco my onco said I did not have to have them.   Funny, the spell check hates my british/ canadian spelling of \"tumours\"",

It is totally safe to consume now. It was created for chemo patients. I drink 1 or 2 a day based on how I feel. The first few times it gave me wacky energy, now it seems more balanced. As for Robes, I can likely get you one cheaper than my site says. I bring them in from the states, so I have to include border charges in my prices. I can get you one direct from the US and save you a little. Let me know when you want to know the lower price.  Sue...Tannic Rivers?

If you do not exfoliate you are wasting your money on lotions and balms. Lotions etc simply will not penetrate dead skin. That said, exfoliating has to be done with some caution. There are 2 kinds of ways to exfoliate: Physical and Chemical. Physical means using salt, sugar, pumice etc or tools like loofah, and other scrubby devices. Personally I have always preferred scrubby gloves for my regular exfoliation head to toe. I use salt and sugar scrubs for occasional exfoliation times. Chemical exfoliants use ingredients like alpha hydroxy acid, fruit acids, glycolic acids etc. Face and décolleté should be exfoliated gently with sugar, chemical or finer grit scrubby devices. Do not exfoliate broken skin, or open sores. On keratosis, psoriasis and excema use extreme caution and when using product only use unscented, natural and sugar based exfoliants. I do not shower everyday, so I exfoliate whenever I shower. Step 2 Moisturization The best times to moisturize are directly after bathing, or before bed. Body and Hands- when skin is still wet from bathing or showering slather on a rich lotion or balm, or body butter onto wet skin, then wrap in a towel or robe for a few minutes. If your skin is oily then use lotion sparingly in those areas. On keratosis, psoriasis and excema use rich unscented products like Shea Butter.  Face- when skin is still wet from toning ( yes toner is an important step for facial skin for those over 25, or with acne issues) add moisturizer in morning, and at night or whenever face is washed. Step 3 Maintenance - If you follow steps 1 and 2 regularly you will see a huge change in your skin within a few days. To Maintain it you can skip the occasional day here and there, but skipping more than a week without these steps will make your skin go back to rough, and dry.  As you know, I sell products for all these things.  I don't want to be known as the girl trying to sell things on this site. If you do want to know more about my products PM me. I am working on a chemo skn kit for my website, and would happily make things cheaper for you guys if you want to be my guinea pigs. I am racing to the post office to get a letter to my kid at camp who bawled his eyes out when i dropped him off..... Cheers, N ",

I figured out that the last time I swam was just before my surgery in Feb. so today was a triumph! I managed a veeeery slow 500metre swim stopping every 2 lengths to catch my breath. I passed most of the old people, but the pregnant one was faster than me. I could only manage mostly breast stroke ( can we find a new name for this one???) and some kicking drill My surgery arm is a bit of a hindrance in some strokes though and it will be sore tomorrow.   I was saying to the BF this week that the chemo pain from Taxol, was different from the pain from Neupagen, and they both are different from plain old -I overdid it at Pilates last night -muscle pain.The Chemo pains seem more poisonous to me... anyone else feel that?? I wonder what will happen moving forward...?  The best parts were.... A) having the old old old people( who have been in that lane since b4 I was born and think they own the freakin' pool)  in the slow lane staring at me wondering why I was there with them. I was armed and ready with the snappy comeback if anyone made a crack at me. I moved over to the medium lane because the old people could not swim in a straight line! B ) just b4 the session was over I realised I was going to have no choice but to shower and change in front of people after the swim. Do I warn them about the 8 inch scar b4 I take my suit off? Do I attempt to hide myself in the corner of the communal shower area? Do I just say screw it and shower and change like everything is normal? Well, once I remembered that I also have no pubic hair, I figured a combo of hiding and acting like everything is normal was the only choice.  No one flinched thank goodness... but when the woman next to me in the shower started soaping up her big boobs and rubbing them round and round like a porn star in a shower scene (man, how dirty could her boobs be? I wondered) I reeeeaaally wanted to turn to her with my hands on my hips and yell SHOW OFF! and storm away.    I didn't of course.    Rock, welcome back.

I think meeting y'all would be awesome!  la la la. I am having a lovely day with no kid and no store.    xoN",

In 1999 my stepdad was diagnosed with Mesothelioma ( a rare cancer that is caused by asbestos exposure and had no treatment at the time) and died 14 months later after Mom nursed him at home, draining his lungs daily and injecting him with morphine. My son was a toddler and we moved in during the final months. 17 months later Mom was diagnosed with Cancer \"primary unknown\" which presented as 6 very very small tumours that took 3 weeks of tests to find. Mom was on low dose chemo for 5 years. Every chemo symptom we have listed she had in some form or other. Her onco's goal was to keep her alive with some quality of life( she worked until 10 weeks b4 her death) for 5 years. We knew she had maybe a few months when a blood clot in her leg moved to her leg and chemo had to be discontinued. She died 5 years and 3 months after diagnosis. As I said earlier she knew she was going to go and sold her house (that we all 3 lived in) that was still tied up in her late husbands estate mess. She found a place with a little apartment in the back for herself and let me and my DS live in the house itself. DS can walk to school and to a park from here. Mom's apartment is one level with two rooms and a (it was her lifetime dream to own one) greenhouse 8 steps out the door. It broke her heart when she could not walk outside even to the greenhouse in the last few weeks.I was her primary care person during her 6 week palliative care. I did all her injections and stuff. I went back to work the day after the funeral and did not take a day off for 5 weeks( damned lady died in late November '06, so the store needed me back badly) I spent much of '07 battling Mummy's Life Insurance company while living in a house that is just a little beyond my current means.   I found my lump in December '07 just under 13 months after she died and got a small Life Insurance cheque the day I met my surgeon. Needless to say, the Life Insurance is almost gone. I guess I got it at the time I needed it. I have used it to keep the store open, and the house finances in order.   So, I am no stranger to cancer, chemo or death.   I said from  day 1 of my diagnosis -if I get the 5 years mom got I will be happy. I plan to get more at this point, but who knows.  I had a totally uneventful Herceptin IV today. Yeah for cancer drugs with no se's!   chemooo to my Sable and my Eddie and my Cris! did I miss anyone??? ",

Sue is right, once the loved one is gone despite the notice it does not feel the same as a sudden death. My feeling has always been that the shock of a sudden death shifts the grieving stages. I think the \"luxury of notice\" allows the ones left behind to be a tiny bit more peaceful about things sooner. My friends 17 year old son died a few weeks ago( I mentioned him earlier)died in his sleep of an aneurysm, and her grief has so much more anguish in it. I dunno, I know how I dealt with it, and I just hope that having that time with Ruby made the process seem a little easier. When my mom died I watched her go, I watched her drift away in the last few days. She needed it to be over and it was like our river analogy almost.... she was swimming away to another shore where there were happy people waiting for her to come I was standing on my shore waving with tears streaming down my face, happy to see her go but still desperate to drag her back.    Eddie, what are Toronto and Seattle collaborating on?

The Ovary removal surgery type may change this. Yes to help around the house for the first week to 10 days or until the drains are out. Help with bathing, and almost anything needing arms(because of the breast surgeries) and no lifting for a few weeks (because of the Ovary removal) Bathing with drains is a total pain. I could not wash my own hair because of arm mobilty etc. ... ( added later, see RanD there is a plus to having no hair at this time ;p)  I was in bed for 2 full weeks with a single mast on massive pain killers with another week for an infection with pretty low energy for at least 5 -6 weeks post surgery. The ovary removal is a cake walk compared to the breast surgery from what I understand. I started walking for exercise at 4 weeks.There was no way I could run -not at all. Swimming is safe after drains are out and surgeon post surgery check up (for me it was 2 weeks after)and wounds are well healed. Arm mobility is very compromised. I still cannot quite swim with full arm mobility after surgery on Feb 15, but your friend will not have lymph removal like many mast women do. By 7-8 weeks I was feeling almost normal... but that is when chemo had just begun... I learned a lot from the boards about other peoples exp. with masts and recon  Added later.  From what I was told/ have heard about on these boards: combining masts and recon may be normal in some places but my surgeon said no way. The risks of complications having both surgeries done at once go up quite a bit. Not to say it is unsafe, but the risk of infections etc is upped.   RanD, by comparison.. the surgery was a breeze compared to the chemo. I was in pain, I was tired, and had a few weepy moments from feeling useless and in pain (and losing a breast of course) but all in all it was ok. I slept and watched movies for 2 weeks. I could not read anything longer than a paragragh for almost 3 weeks, so I read mags and email and watched HGTV( yes, totally addicted) all day long. I finally read a book in week 3.My BF had a little flat screen put on my bedroom wall even though I protested... but I could not have lived without it.  I hope this helps anyone who needs it.   N  ",

We tell our customers when they ask is our products are all natural we say \"yes, but so is gasoline\". Just like with food, unless you know the company and or the ingredients on the back of the label don't trust the front label. Sorry Mary, I did know you were asking about deodorant for your daughter I just forgot. In the chemical free realm of products you will mostly only find deodorants and not anti-perspirants. Most of the products except for the salt based ones will be scented, but with plant based fragrances( aka essential oils) and extracts. I really like the salt crystal one because it has no scent. PM me if you want more info. Gonna get to bed on time for a change.  My eye feels like it may have a sty in it.  Yeah!   xo to all N",

I have not paid myself from the store since January. I had to lend my business money to stay open, and the only reason I had it to lend and had money to live was a small Life insurance policy from my mom that took a year of fighting the insurance company to get.

Stupid tech... now I have bad-ish news that I have to sit on until I get the official results.. AND her two pokes have left me with little cat scratch like marks on my hand because she sucked at doing my injectionsAND in the parking lot on the way home I found that she had left the 6 sticky electrode pad thingys on my chest!!!!!!!  I woke up feeling a little crappy this morning and had a quiet first half of the day at home... then my stupid assistant called. He let me know that Sable and Sue had called! I called them back when I was getting ready and en route to my scan. I had a great chat with both of them. Jen is about 40 times more excitable than you would imagine and I loved it! Sue, is calm and deep and adorable and gave me great luck with getting an awesome parking spot! LOL!     Ok, ladies by now most of you (Cris and RanD yours will ship tomorrow) should have your packages. Eddie, your extras with your lotion should match what everyone else got. Aside from one screw up you should have all received Shea Butter, Salt Scrub, Muscle Mist and a CD. My CRAFT could be kicking in here, but I think that is what was sent. The screw up is that Jen was supposed to not get Muscle Mist because she had previously told me about a eucalyptus allergy and Muscle Mist has eucalyptus. So, I chose the Shea Butter because I talked about it a lot and everybody needs some... and if you remember the convo's about lubricant or have read my stuff on the Mojo thread then you should have some other creative places to try it. PM me if you have questions. The scrub is there for the magic exfoliation that I bugged you all about.. and I chose the scent because Linda told me she loved it when she ordered some things for Xmas. It is a good body scrub, but a little harsh for the face. The muscle mist I chose because I wished everyday during chemo that I could have sprayed you all with it to relieve all the pains you were suffering. The CD was sent for kind of obvious reasons. Read the back, and listen in your quiet moments.   Love you all!",

It is an MLM product so I am a bit embarrased by getting involved with it. Email me if you wanna know more about it. It is a US company so you can get it easily. It is not cheap, but I can help u get it wholesale with no sales pitch.  A friends mom was diagnosed with BC a few months ago. I never knew her mom well, but my little sis grew up hangin' around their house and the dad is the mayor of our town. She died last night and I just found out she got a terrible infection at her port site and had to be hospitalised this week and ended up in a coma and then died. I hate it. Curly/ Dry  hair tip of the day: Deep Conditioning. I deep condition weekly. Sometimes I use Olive oil, sometimes I use Shea Butter. I have psoriasis (have it, can't spell it!!) so the Shea keeps my scalp calm . Today I am working on soap and bombs at the store so I do not have to look that great. I took a pile of Shea and rubbed it all over my face, scalp and hair and tied on a bandana to keep the heat in. You can warm the shea and/ or (mix a little together) olive oil in the microwave and apply it too. If you do this b4 a workout/ walk/ housework day etc you will get a nice deep hair and scalp moisture treatment. I sometimes leave it in all day or overnight, then rinse and lightly condition to get knots out and style as usual. Experiment with a few hours first and wear a bandana, shower cap etc to keep the heat in. I can sell you a $35 deep conditioner, or u can do this..  never wore anything on my head during chemo, so I think it is funny now... upsets people....    xoN",

I was on the phone last night with a friend whose mom has her third cancer. 2x BC and this one is a rare, unrelated cancer in the lung. She is a chronic abusive alcoholic who is nasty to everyone around her and has no friends or family who can or care to take care of her except her son: my friend. He has helped her through all 3 of her cancers, takes every bit of abuse and now his c--- of a girlfriend is complaining he is not around enough and \"i don't kow if I love you anymore because you are always helping your mom and not spending time with me etc\" .( I always disliked the girlfriend, but now.. I hate her)  So, I am all talked out about cancer and how much it sucks the life out of life. Since I have been both cancer careggiver and cancer patient I can see all the sides.. thankfully I have never been the useless friend that leaves a friend in the lurch when things are going badly. I have left that role to some of my family and friends. I have avoided blogging on my cancer blog about how awful this aspect of cancer can because I am worried someone will actually get mad at me for being a bitch about it. Today, I think I have changed my mind. Sue, I saw last night about your good news. I am soooo thankful. Robin, I answered your question about the purple juice on FB. Just FYI everyone. The juice is pure juice with pulp and everything. The acai berry by nature has fatty acids in it, and this brand ads extra fatty acids and glucosamine to it's \"active' version. The floaty stuff is pulp and good for you fatty acids. Nothing to worry about. Tired, borderline sick I think.. or it's the nasty burnt coffee smell from the new coffee roaster behind us. BF is ill,  so who knows. Coffee roasting smell= worst chemo flashback EVER. Almost like the combo of nausea and THAT taste I had in the back of my mouth for 4 months. Closing up now..  xoN",

( said with my best attempt at my mother's Scottish accent) Shea butter is fine as a conditioner, or \"sheen\" in the black world, but it will leave you hair soft and shiny with no hold. I use it in my hair all the time at least once a week to keep my hair soft and my naaaaasty bleeding psoriasis under control. Got a new med for the scalp nighmare yesterday. Also, I found a pea-sized bump on my labia a few weeks ago and got it checked out. nothing major... just that my episiotomy scar is more visible now that my vaginal walls are thinning from age, hormones, chemo etc.... I was pleased it was nothing.... not happy about the thinning walls thingy. I had to choose how to phrase it to the BF.... he already calls me \"the old lady with funny boobs\" amongst many other old lady jokes( he is 6 years younger) so the thinning walls thing was just fuel for that fire. Gonna get my hormones and other shite tested to make sure all is cool as I head into a hard core fat loss diet and training season. It was a Docs appt with nothing really cancer related.... it was odd. The store is soooo dead it is a little nuts. trying not to freak out. Tired of it though. Jen, book a phone consult with me and we will get your hair thing taken care of. Anyone is welcome to do that with me. I am working on a US shipping angle. Hopefully in time for summer. Gotta go check on the new Easter Bunny Bath Bombs assistant dude made yesterday. Today, I am making chocolate bunny lotion bars. Love to all.

Each of us did it differently depending on drug tolerance and the chemo we each got.  Just plan on a long summer of sleeping and sleeping and sleeping. Somewhere on these boards there is a list of things u need for your first chemo... and my personal recc is to prep yourself for constipation after the first one. Some of us did not have it, but the ones who did will agree with me that at least for the first few days/ first week or so that was the worst part. You will be pretty stoned after the first one, and depending on your steriod schedule will be pretty jumpy for the first day or two. The day before chemo will always be your best day. For many of us day 3-8( many of us were on a 2 week schedule) were the worst. Very tired, some of us very nauceous( I still cannot spell that!) The number one rule? If you are puking? Your doc has u on the wrong anti nausea meds.  The girls may have some more to say.  I don't think anyone of us was on CMF.. Tex?  Good luck princess! I will see if I can find some other links on the boards to help you. To all y'all! Love u... yes I am taking it easy.

A pain in the ass at worst...  5) Most of my workout schedule has gone to hell while I try to focus on getting the business back to selling more, but I have found a running partner which is kind of fun. 6) Eddie, can I get info/a copy of the pound a week diet? ummm 7) No Gene test results here yet...so, no recon plans until I know...  8) Kid is home from his camp weeks, he loved most of it 9) Hoping to maybe do a mini tri on Labour Day weekend.... 10) Sadly, the October Texas trip is in jeopardy because of the store and financial issues...

Not enough sleep, lots of gin and tonic, chatting, dancing, reminiscing, and hoping it would last longer .. all the things that college reunions are made of.

I will have a planB in place to move forward,. Maybe I will quit, maybe I will restructure somehow, maybe move to a smaller store.. who knows. It all feels like a kick in the gut after making it through cancer with a smile on my face. Trying not to be jaded and bitchy all the time, but somedays it is hard.

Yesterday the onco nurse asked a bunch of questions and schdeuled my muga and mammo in Dec. and sent the doc in to examinate me. 40 min later he showed up. He asked if I had questions and I told him about the hand pain etc and he said it was from the taxol.... then he started the exam. He asked about when my last Mammogram was. I said in January which was how I was diagnosed...he said... and catch this.... \"THIS YEAR? OR LAST YEAR?\"  ummmmmm this year doctor.... because you are in this room for my FIRST exam since my chemo ended in July. You know.... the chemo we just finished talking about 2 minutes ago!!!  Perhaps he got distracted while touching my boob...? Or maybe despite his name on all my charts he has only met me 4 times including once in the elevator and had no idea who the hell I was...  Today in herceptin I asked the chemo nurse for my bloodwork results, because they did not give them to me yesterday( they never did before either, but I figure the first post chemo test was important) everything is within normal ranges. Karin, if you ask the TV station they will have a service which will allow you to buy a copy of the show you were on. If you need me to chip in to help you get it I can do that.   Eddie, I like doing live TV. You just have to throw caution to the wind and go for it. I do it a lot for our local breakfast TV station.  Sue, yes Origins is fine. They are one of the few big companies that have elimiated parabens. Have any of guys tried pure shea butter on the rads skin? What are the things they have been telling you about the products to put on the redness? No oils? water based? Light? heavy?  I hope everyone is well!   I am wiped and the day was wrecked by the billions of hours to and fro  and sitting in the hospital etc.",

RanD's return, Rock's bone focus thingy to be nothing, and for Eddie and Adrienne to meet soon. Those are just things I want to happen. Cris.. me too for your address SVP!  Oh, I forgot to mention My friend Rachel got to meet Pam at Rock's party... it was me.. one step closer to Rock. Loved hearing all about it!  I had today off and got to work in the garden finally putting away all the summer furniture and bikes and such. I feel all cruddy and hot and yucky. Hot Flashes and Period pains( no, I have not officially had it yet, but it threatens regularly) sore fingers and sinus pressure...   I watched my kid in my churches Charlie Brown Christmas play tonight. It was a Jazz vespers at church and they had the kids read the Charlie Brown Xmas lines in between tunes. I wanted to see him, but I did not want to see any of the old church gang ( my dad was the organist there, I basically grew up in the building) and answer questions about cancer.. they said a prayer for me in the service and for another woman ( when she was a little girl I used to babysit her)  who is dying of BC mets to the brain. Then I got a glass of sherry in the parlour ( not sure when they started this, maybe I should go to vespers more often) and was ok.   I am off to bed. It is going to be a long long week. Our seasonal help conveniently is leaving town on the 18th, so cannot help us during the busiest week of the damn season!!   I am blethering now.   Night all.   Notter",

Until recently every workout made me painfully sore for a week or more.  From what I can tell the nails are from the first chemo. If you think about how nails grow, the damage was months ago and the cells of the nails bed got all fecked up at the same time as the hair follicles did.The growth you are seeing at the top is that damage. I felt fingertip pain until about a month ago which was 2 months out of chemo. My toenails still ache from closed shoes and KILL me after I run. Randie, you seem in great spirits.

As of my meeting with the genetics counsellor yesterday it was not definite as my granny may or may not have had BC( mast with no biopsy as far as we know and we would need to get proof from a small hospital in Scotland etc etc)  and there is no other family history.  The province will not pay for a gene test if the risk is low.. I was MAAAAD!  They counsellor made a case for me because my mom's cancer was \"primary Unknown\" and even though there is a strong likelyhood it was colon, it was often speculated it may have been ovarian and also because I had more than one tumour. I get my MUGA, Herceptin and my Gene test on Monday! Because of slow labs it could take 6 months to get results though which is annoying....  and I will not decide about recon until have the answer... so now I know recon is off the charts for this next 6 or so months.   I have to run.

I have lived alone most of my adult life (me and roommates never worked) but once I moved in with mom and had a kid I got wierd.. ;)Having her ashes here made me feel a little like she was here so I am glad I made the choice to keep some. The kitten just walked into the front door!  I was leaving food out, and the BF told me she'll never want back in if she gets fed and can be outside. So, about 20 minutes ago I took the food off the porch. We have been keeping the front door perched open a little, and she just wandered in!    My 2 days off are over.

In my land of Curly haired people a hair dryer is called a Blowfryer( there are options for hair dryers and good attachments, but not many) and my curly mentor has it written in her will that no one is to brush or comb her hair EVER! This system is rock solid and I will help you as best as I can. The no washing thing is the start to getting you all to be Sulphate Free. More later.  Jackie, face and body paint/ costume paint  is what you want. Places like Party Packagers and Costume shops will have it.Some are liquid, some are grease paint in pots or sticks. You'll need some makeup sponges to put it on a large area( like your head) in a smooth and even way. Get the basketball colour in larger quantity and get the black in a stick or use a paint brush. Practice a few times on your arm or face to get used to the texture of the paint. It's easy, but plan on an hour to put it on. Your homemade soap and some oil will be fine to remove it.   Any other questions?  ;)   N",

Jen, no reason to sacrifice softness for colour. Once you are deep conditioning regularly and washing less often colour will last longer and not do much damage. Hair colour changes hair texture chemically to bond the colour to the cuticle of the hair. Under a microscope all hair that has had artificial colour put on it actually looks like curly hair whether it is curly or not.   Love to all!   N",

When you shower, scrub your scalp with hot water (yes, even if you workout 40 times a week) and use a little conditioner, then get the knots out with your fingers.. if your hair is curly you no longer own a comb, a brush or a pick. No tools!! Hear me? Try not to wash for 2 or 3 days straight and we will go from there. The one with the least bubbles wins.  ",

Your 3 main products are called DevaCurl \"No Poo\" \"One Condition\" and \"AnGell\" don't bother getting anything else right now, you will just be confused. Don't bother with the travel set it will only give you about 3-5 days of use. Save up (about $18 USD per 12oz bottle) and get the larger sizes.  Once you own the products email me and we will set up a phone appt and I will run you through the way to use them best. There are salons listed on the site that are trained by Deva too. They really are the best and only way to deal with your curly hair in a natural way. Add me on FaceBook and I will show you some AMAZING curly pics. If anyone wants to try our curly philosophy but cannot afford the products let me know and I will walk you through some less expensive ways. There is a book on the site that is worth every penny.. \"Curly Girl\"  I am thinking about starting a chemo curly website. What do u guys think?  I hope RanD is fairing ok...  Jen..

I said then why do you order lab work appt every 9 weeks when I see  one of the Docs on the team? He said \" oh some of the Docs do that by routine, but we don't need it\"   What I should have said, but didn't...  soooo... idiot face... in a public health care system with limited resources you are telling me that I have had blood drawn every 9 weeks for 6 months or so for no reason....??? I thought they drew blood to look at other things, liver? feck I dunno! I am not a freakin' doctor... but I soooooo love having my blood drawn and wasting nurses/ hospital time and money... So, I got Herceptin and she used one poke, and dug around like a nut and now I have a huge bruise! and she asked about the port.. I think I am going to print up the story of my idiot Doc and the port story and carry copies to every appointment.. and wear a button that says.. ask me about my port and see what happens next... WHACK!!!!!  She asked about which side she is using I said the right( my non surgery side) and told her no one touches the left ever after what happened with my flu shot... and she argued that the flushot would not aggrevate my lymph area etc... I wanted to WHACK her again and ask how her SNB site was doing... So, all in all an annoying day. As far as the Onco nurse(not the chemo nurse with 2 shovels to the head) thought and since the Doc said I can wait another 3 months to get the next heart test... I guess my heart is ok ... which honestly.. I wish I had been given a call about. 4 months of worrying... and the only reason I know my last results from Feb is that I called to ask ( which as u know also told me that my Jan score of 49 was re- evaulated to a 50)  I wonder how many patients a doc gets.... I have 1200 customers on my mailing list and way more that are not on the list and I know many of them by name.. and most of them by product faves.... Anyway..Today I am thankful Gracie is ok... and thinking about Sue and how a great day can be ruined by a death in the family. Glad u are retiring... sorry u can't have tomorrow as a lie in bed forever/ do whatever you feel like day. Glad Jen has good tests. Who knew Otter spoke French ;) and want to let everyone know curly hair goes on and on it spirals on forever... ;)x2 I hope, hope hope that Kristy goes to see Sue after the surgery... and that this month sometime I get to meet Linda and maybe Jen... I will keep u posted... not forgetting anyone.. just not caught up yet... Love to all. back to work, blogging, tweeting etc.. xoN",

I don't care about being lopsided, but looking all pointy like a hippy on parade at work is not a good look I don't think. LOL! I can wear a mohawk to work, but I am sensitive about showing nipples through my shirt.. how silly is that???   I am trying to get the house clean b4 the next tx too, it is making me a littel crazy.  cheers everyone!

As for the house cleaning, yes I can ask for help. Sadly in this house it is more than cleaning that I need. I only moved here 2 years ago, and the whole first 7 months was helping my mom through her last chemo treatments and untimately her paliative care etc (she did not have b/c and was alive on chemo for 5 years)  Then the next few months was dealing with the funeral, grieving etc. Since I am a single mom/ enterpreneur time is at a premium. So the long story short is the house is a mess because we are still barely moved in... and here I am with b/c. Once I was diagnosed we finally got my bedroom close to done so I could do my post surgery time in a clean organized room. Thank God we did that!   I find it hard to ask for help because the house is always in some sort of chaos. For example, since surgery i have been running my business from a corner of my dining room so there are papers everywhere blah blah blah... I think my church ladies would have a heart attack if they came in here. I get the dishes and the laundry done, but the rest is crazy  I promise, I will find a way to ask for help, and on my low energy days when I am awake I will get some of those damned papers sorted!!!    I see the Onco tomorrow and get blood work to prep for Wed tx#2.  Have a good one y'all  Noelle  ",

I can't work on the codeine ( I just fall asleep) either which is out of the question.  So, I have had to shorten the hours at the store on the days I work because I can only stay upright for a few minutes at a time without moving around.   Thankfully I have no mouth sores, no constipation, and only a little throat issues.  To Revcat, I am only just past half way. I won't be done until mid July, and then  I have herceptin for a year.  We are all here at camp chemo, and the campfires will be burning all summer!   I think I will trade the Taxol s/e's for the A/C ones any day, but this is still  hellish.

The joint and finger pain is rough, but somehow it feels more manageable than the digestive issues and the mouth and throat sores. I was happily more active this time around too.  The weight gain is really getting me down. I have had to buy all new cancer clothes to get through the summer. Since I trained for triathlons for the last 5 summers my summer wardrobe is the smallest sizes I own and nothing will even do up.   I know this should be the least of my worries, but this upsets me a lot.  I think maybe since I have fewer side effects the petty stuff seems to have found room in my head to piss me off. I am way more emotional and hormonal too. Lots of trouble sleeping so I am super tired. I have a friend who has a one year old in chemo right now too so I think of that when I am getting petty about stuff like clothes. I think of you all a lot. I hope everyone has an easy day.  Noelle  ",

She got to see me from day 2 until day 5 and is totally amazed at how crappy the chemo reality is. I am supremely achey from taxol #2, yesterday was the worst though, a lot of shooting pain through the hips and knees, I napped on an off through the day.  The pain is definately worse than Taxol #1. Ibufprofen barely helps, and I only have tylenol with codeine which makes me nauseous so i only take it at bedtime. I still wake up with the night sweats every hour or two, so I am not sure if the codiene helps or not. Lisamed, yes that is my last day too, 6 or so days of neupagen after that and I am done except for Hercerptin for a year. Hopefully August will be a month of slowly getting back to food that tastes right and a workout schedule that gets rid of some of the 15 lbs I have gained. I cannot wait.  It is official, here in Canada at least where I am there will be no post chemo scans for cancer.  I get a yearly mammogram and a check up with the onco but no tests or scans. Only heart tests while on the herceptin.  \"There is no proof that scanning after chemo makes any difference to finding recurring cancer down the road\" ... Is this normal? I thought  I had read that some of you were expecting PET scans and such after chemo.  I am going to  have tea and a bath, hopefully some of this achyness will subside tomorrow.  Have a good one everyone.  Noelle  ",

I have been miserable with work and s/e's after tx#3 so have been hiding out a lot.  Today is day 12 after AC#3 and  still barely feel myself.  I have no choice but to work 3 days each week and this cycle it has been hard to do this. I set up a new desk in the store with a new more comfortable chair so I can rest while I am at the store.  I am no longer constipated, but the fissures and the hemoroids are not healing no matter what. I got my period for 2 days which cleared up a nasty yeast infection. 'Down there' has been my area of concern most of the time. I  had throat sores that kept me from eating anything solid for 2 days and the fatigue has been killer.   I can't wait to get my last AC over with this coming week.  Anybody into the s/e's of Taxol yet?  I would love to hear more about that.  Cheers everyone, Noelle  ",

Normally he does not call often, it doesn't bug me \"normally\"  My jackass of a little sister is a single mom like me. Unlike me she has a full time job with benefits.  I am ( happily) self employed and I have no child support or benefits at all( my son's dad left the country and cannot be found), she is too lazy to do the work to get her ex to pay his share od child support, and complains about it all the time.  She will receive $80,000 this year from mom's estate. She got cash, I got a house. We both are very very lucky as far as I am concerned.  I hung up on her when she had the balls to complain about money and that she had to take extra work .... She is a teacher and has the summer off but is choosing to work to make MORE??  Meanwhile her kids have to be in a crappy day care (apparently she cannot afford a fun camp for them) all summer so she can have MORE money???  I counselled her through being beat up by her 6 figure income husband, I  counselled her through mom's dying when she bothered to show up, I helped her budget her way to getting out and getting on her own 2 feet etc etc. She has not shown up here once, not to see me, not to take my kid, not for anything.... but she \"thinks about me all the time\"  My brother, my sister and my best friend have been absent during my whole illness and no one is surprised but it does not take the sting away.  Otter, I can tell from your posts that you are a helper/ caregiver type personality. They likely turn to you  becuase you have always been the strong one. Isn't it all too bad?  Just once I wish the selfish ones could see themselves for what they are and how they hurt people around them... because I am convinced most of them have no clue. Don't be embarrased, you can rant to me about such things any day.  Noelle  ",

I am not timid at all, but the reactions I get are certainly interesting. Day 4 sucked horribly for me, I got my hair cut in my store in front of the press and friends, customers and family.  I was awake for 12 hours and could barely stand up by the end of it. Day 5(yesterday) was a total write off. I had to close my store for the day and stay in bed. The s/e's from the Neupagen are bearable, but the exhaustion from overdoing it on Saturday were bad. Today my store is closed anyway so I rested as much as I could and worked for a few hours in the afternoon.  Man, I hope tomorrow is better and I so look forward to day 12 and 13 with no Neupagen before I do A/C #2 on day 14.  I hope everyone is doing ok.",

Then, whoever did not know figured it out pretty quickly.There were not a lot of people dancing so the bald girl with the drunk boyfriend (in plaid pants and white suede shoes) on the dance floor made everyone stare.  It was a long night and my son stayed at a friends so I got to sleep in. SE's are a little better, mood is pretty low though. I did get into the garden and do some clean up today so I feel good about that. I have to work tomorrow but cannot make my mind stop so I can sleep. I have to go and do my nightly regimen of gargling for the mouth sores and the laxatives for you know what. I found that stool softeners with the milk of magnesia AND the lactolose together made today survivable in that dept. Still very painful though.    g'night everyone  Noelle  ",

She upped the dose of my presciption laxative, but other than that I can try some OTC pain creams for hemoroids and just wait. So, be careful ladies, I was not aggressive enough with the laxatives b4 and just after tx 2 and have not had a painless BM ( this is what I was raised to call it as a child) in 10 days. I am no longer constipated, but the pain is barely managable. This is a se that I would not wish on my worst enemy. Other than that I am doing ok these last few days. I worked yesterday,I went for a run/ walk workout this morning and have one more day of great energy b4 tx3. I hope good energy for all of you.

The squeaky wheel is sometimes the only way to be.  Noelle P.S. I still cannot get used to how people stare at me with the bald head. It is way wierder staring than the mohawk got. In my head I am just Noelle walking down the street and wondering why cars are slowing down and small children are pointing and then I remember... oops I look like a freakin' character from a Star Trek show just walking down the street. You all should try it sometime, on one of those days when your hats and wigs are getting you down. Pretend I am right there with you(I would go with you if I could) walking down the street laughing at peoples reactions. It really is quite fun.   ",

I lost the boob first, so the hair is no big deal. Once I accepted that very little changed with the breast removal, I accepted that the hair was nothing. I forced myself to look at the scar on the first day after surgery to push myself to early acceptance. I cried, but I let it go as best as I could.    Cheers!  Noelle  ",

The treatment over all is called ACT or TAC depending on Doctor, cancer types and locations of all of us.   I am doing dose dense A/C for 4 treatments over 8 weeks and dose dense T for 8 weeks after that.  I am HER2+ but here they do the treatment for that after chemo is over. If the Doc is spacing your chemo 3 weeks apart, you may be able to work in weeks 2 and 3 without too much issue.

I am renovating a bit and I don't have a full length mirror, so this was the first time I really saw how yucky I look head to toe.  Todays project is to get my kid into summer camp and I have to get my priest and school principal to sign letters for a bursary for camp so I have a lot of running around to do.    ",

It started to come out a little just b4 TX#2, but I thought I could keep it for another week. I combed it the day after and it was crazy how much came out. By day 3 I had a receding hairline that was far from becoming.   I wore a scarf to work on that day and my staff told me they just could not imagine me in scarves for 4 months. I shaved it the next day, and I have a new electric razor and I shave it every morning down to the skin. I sunscreen it when I do  my face and then I use my foundation on it so it matches my face. I scare small children and my small town is having trouble not staring at me, but hell I wore a mohawk to the school yard every morning for a week.   I have a blue wig, a black betty boop type wig and a long pure white one. I think I will have one or two to wear to the reunion and I will go bald for the dancing.   I found a perfect 80's prom dress in my clothes collection that has a perfectly placed flounce to hide the bloated belly so I am happy.    I spent another pile of money at the health food store on meds for the fissures, the constipation and such. I had to get some protein powder for my smoothies for the damned liquid diet and found a bunch of stuff that might help. Angie.. I forgot about the bananas! I keep eating them cause I can with the mouth sores and forget that they may not be the best choice with the constipation. Lauren, I bought some Senna Tea, and hope that helps tonight. Otter, yes I know about the over drinking of water. I just did not think anyone that was not working out and sweating could even consume that much. I am an amateur triathlete and we hear about the people that over hydrated all the time. You can make your own electrolyte replacement drinks with a splash of real juice, water and a pinch of sea salt.Gatorade and things like it are really quite bad for you- full of artificial colours, too much sugar and chemicals. You may as well just throw some salt in a can of coke.   I am on my local breakfast tv show in the morning. I have to get up at 5, which sucks, but it is free publicity for the store. The uproar in town with the bald chick on TV will be quite interesting.   I am going to have to nap a lot tomorrow to get ready for the reunion on Saturday.    Roberta, my son is 9 and started crying when talking to the principal last week. He just needed me to explain again that I was going to be ok, as long as I did what the doctors said. From now on I plan to ask him more often how he feels about all of this.  night everyone..

Lactolose, stool softeners, and senna tea are not making it much better.  I will call the onco on Monday and let them know.  Lauren, don't forget that it has taken a whole lifetime for your brain to get to know what you look like. The imprint is very deep. Undoing that cannot happen in a few months. I think we all hate how we look so different from 6 months ago.     My only mission is my son, that is how I get through. In 1998 I was a drug addicted, abused woman with a newborn that pulled up her low self esteem  enough to walk out on the jackass that got me hooked etc and started again. I moved in with my mom and helped /watched her husband and her die of cancer in the last 7 years. When I got diagonosed I just had to say \" well, god got me through the rest of the last few years and I have no choice but to trust he will get me through this\"  I have asked him for 5 years to watch my son grow up and I hope and pray I will get more.   I was blessed with an ornery (sp?)tenacious bullheaded nature and that is what makes walking around bald (or with a mohawk) be ok for me.  Stop comparing yourself to anyone else in this regard. I am sure, in other ways you are being strong and getting through this. You sound like a bright confident woman, so what that you are not comfortable being bald in public! This is your breast cancer, not anyone elses. Tim says to me b4 every triathlon \" run your own race\" so if I come in last,  or suck in the swim or whatever it does not matter, I tried, and it was my race to run as I want to.  Even though  we have  each other to count  on, we all know there are things about this experience that we feel alone in. Late at night and you're looking in the mirror all miserable you just feel alone and thinking \"this sucks!\"-don't forget, we are all looking in the mirror thinking the same thing!   I am off to give myself a facial for my reunion. I am either going bald, or wearing a pink or blue wig. I have my new stick on boob now though!  ",

Microwave chocolate and butter in large microwave bowl at high 2 minutes or until butter is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. 3. Stir sugar into chocolate. Mix in eggs and vanilla until well blended. Stir in flour and nuts. Spread in greased 13 x 9 inch pan. Actually, I line the pan with foil and then grease it. That way I can pull the whole brownie out of the pan at once cut it easier when it is done. Cheesecake layer... 16 oz cream cheese, softened 2/3 cup sugar 2 eggs 4 Tbs flour 1 tsp almond extract Blend together with a fork and drop by spoonfuls on top of the brownie batter and carefully smooth out. The cream cheese has to be room temp and you will get a little bit of the brownie swirled into the cheesecake....that's ok, just try and get it as smooth as you can. If you don't want to make the rocky road fudge layer, you can add 1 cup of mini chocolate chips to the cheesecake and then swirl it together with the chocolate layer before you bake...that is yummy too! 4. Bake aprox 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out with fudgy crumbs and the cheesecake is set. Don't over cook! Cool on the counter, and then in the fridge. Rocky Road Fudge... 2 cups granulated sugar 3/4 cup evaporated milk 2 ounces baking chocolate, unsweetened 1 tablespoons light corn syrup 2 tablespoons butter 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 cup miniature marshmallows 1/2 cup chopped pecans sprinkle marshmallows over the cooled brownies then put in the freezer while making fudge. Lightly butter the interior of a 2-quart saucepan; add sugar, milk, chocolate, and corn syrup. Cook over medium high heat until the mixture begins to boil. Continue boiling gently, stirring frequently, until the mixture reaches the soft ball stage or registers about 234° to 238°. You can do this step in the microwave it you watch it carefully. Remove saucepan from heat; add butter and vanilla without stirring. Let cool for about 30 minutes, then beat with a wooden spoon until the fudge just begins to thicken. Add chopped nuts and beat for a few more minutes, until it begins to lose its gloss but is still pourable. Pour over marshmallows. When fudge is firm, cut brownies and eat....YUM",

I hated the camisole but pinned the pouch to all my clothes so i could walk around the house.  Roberta, I have managed to keep the business open , but my business manager just informed me that we are $11,000 behind in sales at 2nd quarter which we know is because my staff sells less than I do. I am going to have to work my ass off to get things back on track for the last 2 quarters!!!  Yuck!    Have a great weekend y'all!",

I specialise in teaching people how to take care of their hair (mostly curly clients, but I teach anyone) with no sulfates, no silicone and no petroleum products. My curly clients are frizz free all year round if they follow my instructions ( and I scold them if they don't) My hair was waist length when we cut it off for charity.  The joke right now is: many people get curly hair as a result of chemo ( aka chemocurly) ... what happens if mine comes back straight?    I am starting a section on my site for chemo and cancer patients to teach them how to \"look good, feel better\" without chemical laden products that likely assisted in giving many of us cancer in the first place.    cheers, Noelle  ",

Still lots of tingling in my finger tips and feet, and my heartburn is yucky. I took myself of the Nexium to see if that was adding to my bloating and the Zantac 150's just are not cutting it. My energy level is pretty good when I can sleep. I work for the next 2 days on the floor at the store so we will see how I do there. I work for hours at home, but I am sitting down most of the time.  My eyelashes are done for I am sorry to tell you. I think I have 4 left between both eyes.  The hot flashes have lightened up a little too, so I can sleep a little better. I just read that it can take up to a year for menstruation to start again if it is going to. Personally I would prefer to have it back as opposed to menopause.  Any word from Angie?   Take Care everyone!",

With all the chemo you just had, if there was anything there I bet it did not have a chance to survive. Sue, I was not active at all during chemo. I was itching to get in the pool. My energy level shocked me at that workshop. I have been wiped ever since though.  My goal is to race at the end of the month,we'll see if I can pull it off. I feel better everyday, tomorrow  will be 4 weeks. I am not sure I feel myself, but I feel better than I have in months.  Woo hoo Roberta! we are here on the shore waiting for you!
