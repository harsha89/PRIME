They use to have something that is soft fluid filled like lumps and mine is tiny rock hard one which is not painful. So i was trying to check if anyone experienced it and might be a sign of a cancer and maybe i have it on my breast as well. From the last ultrasound that i had the doctor said that the lump on my breast has high posibility of being benign knowing that it has been here for 5 years without changing size and not having signs of cancer at all (dimpling, nipple discharge, etc). I am worries sick about the lump on my armpit and groin since it gives me a lot of thoughts about having a breast cancer that metastisize on my lymph nodes.",

      "Content": "RsRio wrote: Hi.. im just new here but read a lot from here about breast cancer and other stuff. I am 30 years old and found a lump on my left breast when i was 25 due to the ultrasound request from my OB as part of prevention. i was given a byrads cat 3 and did a follow up after 3 mons with same cat and result. I was then asked for 6 mons interval ultrasound which i never did. 4 years later i was worried and decided to go back to the hospital to check it and on the 2 follow ups i was given ths same result. The lump stayed the same size as it was before 4 years ago. I was ask to be diligent on my follow ups which was set every 6 mons. My doctor gave me a food suplement (evening of primrose) which she said might help decreasing the size of the lump. Well, i took it. My problem came in after a month when i noticed a really small rock hard lump on my armpit. It was smaller than a pea and i think it is connected to my skin since i can lift it up and press it when i try to lift my skin up. I also found a pea size and another really tiny one in my groin. The pea size one seems to be connected to the muscles or i dont know but it is not moving. The lumps are not painful though but im afraid it might be a sign of something or i have a lymphoma already. I havent seen my doctor yet, maybe im just too afraid to know that it is something i should be concern of. BTW i had a cough and cold before but i really cant tell whether the lump was due to it or not. My cold and cough were already gone 2 weeks ago but the lumps are still here. I hope someone can share their insight on this. I am planning to visit my doctor maybe next week but would like to hear more about it for now. Thanks a lot. Log in to post a reply",
