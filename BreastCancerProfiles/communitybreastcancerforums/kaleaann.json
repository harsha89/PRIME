This is my very first post! Thank you for sharing your experiences, they have become my source of comfort and strength in times when i feel very lost especially during my chemo treatment. I am from the Philippines and we don't really have a breast cancer support group that I could turn to whenever i need something to share notes with, so to speak.  It's very difficult out here to be a cancer patient, especially since most of us do not have medical insurance and pay everything out of pocket.  I just started my radiation 5 days ago. So far, so good. Just a little tightening of skin on my armpit side.  I have been using homeopathic calendula cream since day 2.    My concern really is this ... my 19 month daughter just had her MMR and DPT vaccine boosters today and i am not sure if it's safe for me to be around her.  I remember i was told to avoid being with her when she had her vaccine shots during my chemo treatment. Is this the same for radiation?  Should i avoid her for a day or two? I would hate for her to be without me since my husband has gone back to the States two days ago (where he is originally from) and it is just me and her now. Thank you in advance for your replies.
