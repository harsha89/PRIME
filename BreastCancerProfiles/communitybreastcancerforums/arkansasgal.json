He was straight forward with me, and said he felt there was a 70%+ chance that it was papillary carcinoma in situ. He showed me the mammogram images and explained in detail why he was confident of this diagnosis. He was careful to say that I would have to have an ultrasound and an MRI to confirm this. An ultrasound was done immediately and confirmed the diagnosis. Again, the radiologist came in and talked with me. I was then scheduled for a core needle biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis. Then an MRI for further confirmation. All along the way, the radiologist was there talking with me after each procedure.",

I felt so relieved to learn that it was non-invasive, small and has a good prognosis, and then I started down the road imagining what else could be in there. I realize this thinking is counter-productive and does not help anything. ",

I keep replaying what the doctor said when going over my ultra-sound guided biopsy he performed. \"This is good, and I don't anticipate any surprises on the MRI\". \"And, I don't think there is much of the tumor left after the biopsy\". So far, everything he has said has been true, but why would he say he doesn't anticipate any surprises on the MRI when he really doesn't have the results yet. He knew it was Papillary Carcinoma In Situ before the biopsy. He is a renowned physician specializing in MRI, and developed the specialized MRI machine used in the clinic I go to.
