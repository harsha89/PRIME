      "Content": "Oct 30, 2013 07:22AM - edited Oct 31, 2013 06:18AM by encyclias It was recommended that I do chemo first by my MD Anderson-certified oncologist and then decide on either a lumpectomy or a MX. Seems to be their new protocol for my stats. I started with two lumps, one 2.7cm and the other 2.3cm along with some nodes, both axillary and interstadial. I had A/Cx4, 3 wks apart. After the third infusion, neither of the lumps could be felt. A month after the last chemo treatment, I had another mammo and US and there was nothing to be seen anymore. However, these tests do not find things under 5mm. I decided to have an LX and a SNB and let the surgeon take a look. He found one lump had totally been destroyed by the chemo and the other had a tiny 3mm bit left which he removed (3mm out of an original total of 50mm). Not perfect, but the margins were wide and clear, and the SNB was negative as well. The two thin incisions healed very quickly and without discomfort -- unless I forgot and raised my arm to reach something on a high shelf during the first few days. Then on to rads. One of the reasons I did not go for an MX is, being a diabetic (Type 2, a few pills a day), we tend not always to heal very well and the less I would have to heal, the better. Not having had problems in the past, still a MX and reconstruction would require a lot of healings over a long period of time. Second, I am the sole caregiver for a handicapped husband. Third, it seemed overkill to have an MX with a now-negative mammo and US. The chemo, LX and rads seemed to work best for me. I had a follow-up PET scan last week, a year after my original diagnosis and PET, and I have NED anywhere at the present. Of course, like all these scans, it can't see less than 5mm. We all have to make our own decision based on our own personal and family needs and health situation. Good luck in making your decision. I am sure it will be the right one for you. Carol",

For some, the neoadjuvant chemo works, and for some it doesn't work as well.  Different chemo drugs than mine can similarly be used and get the same types of results.

My SO has had CT scans to check for bleeding inside the brain; a few times yes, a few times no. He also has had an ultrasound of his neck arteries to see that there was plaque buildup which could chip off and obstruct a bit of the blood flow in his brain. And of course several electroencephalograms (brain wave) tests. These TIAs can sometimes presage a major stroke. Carol",

Hopefully, the doctors will be able to get things back under control for your mother soon.  Carol",

I didn't have any fatigue, nor nausea, but my skin over the sternum got toasted good!  That is unlike my  whole breast radiation from which I only had a little 1/2\" skin break about a week after my rads ended. I cannot say how your sternum will take the rads.  Ask your RO if they are using electrons and how many treatments you need.  The electrons they used on me went all the way through the sternum itself to reach the nodes below it, so I wouldn't think it would be much different from yours if they are just targeting your sternum.  But then again, I guess there are different strengths and it can be set for different depths, so yours may be very different.  Ask the rad techs there; they are usually more forthcoming with information.

I'm at the last of my rads now, just 4 boosts to go, and I will be turned loose for a month or two (which in itself is scary). Good luck in your treatment.  You can beat this. Carol",

I had a PET scan last month, and very different from my first one in Oct 2012, this one was clear of cancer.  Hope it will last. Had I done it the other way, with adjuvant chemo instead, I would have had to have a MX or settle for a LX and a very deformed breast (I am not big-breasted).   I am a diabetic and as such, it is well known that we don't heal wounds very easily in general; so certainly a MX or BMX would not be a first choice -- and certainly not reconstruction either.  It wasn't an issue of vanity; it was more an issue of potential healing problems.  Also ripping out a bunch of lymph nodes could certainly cause future permanent complications, such as lymphedema.  And then, as has been brought up, there would be no way of knowing if the chemo actually worked!  This board has many threads titled  --  (your choice of: taxol, taxotere , A/C) -- \"didn't shrink my tumor.\"  What if this happened during adjuvant rather than neoadjuvant chemo?  How would the doctors know, except waiting to see if the cancer shows up somewhere else in the future? But doctors have their own protocol which they feel works for them.  Hopefully, theirs will work for you.  Good luck!  The choices can drive you crazy. Carol ",

Sat down and had a discussion as well with my RO today and he said it was fairly common to have some pain along the scar, and that some patients also get shooting pains in the breast; not to worry and let him know if I needed any painkillers.  I am trying to be optimistic and hoping to breeze through these rads.  But if not, I do have a doctor who will try to keep me comfortable, which is a tremendous relief. I also asked him what damage I can expect to my innards and he told me just the very top of my right lung and that my heart is a 'zipcode' away from the beam. I wish everybody pain-free success with their treatments.  I will be so glad when this is over Carol",

Best wishes to your mom for a completely successful recovery. Carol",
