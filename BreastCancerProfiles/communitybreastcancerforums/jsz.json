After an MRI my doctor scheduled an ultrasound biopsy, yet when I read the report I got conflicting interrpretations. The 'lesion' as they refer to it, is BI-RADS 'O', 1.1cm.  Another spot was BI-RADS 3,  3 mm, and suspected to be benign. I have a strong family history of breast cancer (mother and Aunt) and no one is forth coming with information. I'm not liking the sounds of this, don't want to panic, but don't want to not be concerned either. Should I be looking for referrals for surgeons at this point? BTW, I'm 55, same age as my mother when she was diagnosed 30 years ago. Log in to post a reply",
