It helps me both fall asleep and then actually STAY asleep without a drug hangover the next morning. Please ask your doc about this!!!!! I like it much better than Ambien, because back when I was on ambien, it stopped working for me after a while. I've been on Trazodone for years, and it's honestly not failed. My dearest wish for you is some good rest. I know when I am exhausted, I cannot think straight, and I'm so much more emotional and anxiety ridden than normal. I think if you can just get some consistent sleep you will feel 1000% better. You are not alone. You are NOT alone. Sending you light and love - LL",

Klonopin takes a little longer to kick in, but is much longer acting. Xanax is in the same family of drugs as Klonopin and Ativan (the benzodiazapines). Not everyone gets sleepy on these...but it can be a common side effect, especially at first. The dosages between these drugs do not equal each other...meaning that 1 mg of Klonopin is not the same as 1 mg of Xanax or Valium (also in the benzo family). Everyone is a little different, Xanax never did much for me as far as reducing anxiety, but other people love it. I prefer Klonopin or Ativan.",

Even though I know everyone has problems - but most people are not dealing with Stage IV breast cancer. I get impatient (in my head only - on the outside, I smile and nod in all the right places...) with people griping and moaning about trivial matters. They magnify simple issues, and it just makes me crazy. The other part of this that really gets under my skin, is that no matter how kind, how understanding, how supportive a non-ill friend is, they just cannot get it. They cannot get what this experience is. I try to act as normal as possible around people, but I feel on some level like I'm acting. The inner monologue never stops. Nor does the wish to have my greatest problem to be something, anything that doesn't involve this cancer. I'd give almost anything to get the rest of my life back - problems great and small along with it.",

I should say right at the outset, I'm premenopausal (just had recent bloodwork done showing that), and I have for years had terrible nightsweats from my antidepressant medication. It works on Seratonin, and for me going back 23 years, when the depression lifts, and the drug is working, I get the nightsweats. Well, here lately, they've gotten even worse (which I never thought possible). I think it might be due to the addition of Tamoxifen. I literally wake up at about 3-4 a.m. sopping wet - jammies totally wet (as if they were out of the washer), the bed soaked, even my pillow soaked through. It's awful and cold, and just try going back to sleep after all that. Last night, my fingers were literally pruny. So, I can't quit my antidepressant. I've tried - it's not pretty. So, my question is how do I live with this? I've seen some pj's that are supposed to be somehow made to better deal with this. I don't know if anyone has any ideas at all. My onc looked at me with a raised eyebrow, and said, \"Huh...usually we give people SSRI's to STOP nightsweats.\" Leave it to me. I'm not taking any supplements that are supposed to help this, because many of those act estrogenic in the body, which is the last thing I need - more estrogen...but just curious how you cope?

Without the crazy highs/lows of blood sugar caused by nearly constant drinking of regular soda, I found that right away I was much less hungry. Then, I reduced portion sizes...then slowly started eating healthier foods (low fat, no more pots full of noodles, etc.). I've lost 45 lbs. in a year, and when I get the urge to have something like fried cheese sticks at a restaurant, I have them. I feel like I already have Stage IV, so at this point, I'm not denying myself things, or doing anything that feels very unnatural to me. I wouldn't even know how to be a vegan. I'd have no idea what to eat, and I don't want to work that hard to figure it out. If I followed the vegan diet, the low carb diet, the Atkins diet, and the Zone diet all at once, I'm pretty sure that there would be no foods left to eat! There are so many women that exercised, never drank, were vegans who still got breast cancer - all stages. They did everything they were \"supposed to\", and still got it. So - until someone can point to definitive unbiased studies on this - I'm doing what I want, without an iota of worry.",

Just a note that this was not asking any person for their own money...all they had to do was click or share for the organization, MetaVivor, to do the donating. Also, the people that I'm friends with on FB, are truly my real life friends as well, so I really didn't think asking them to simply share a picture or visit the MetaVivor site was asking a whole lot - especially when I see all manner of frivolous posts saying \"Like If you Agree, etc.\" (What does that do, or even mean?). Given the timing of my dx, and very recently telling these folks the reality of it, again, I didn't think I was asking for a whole lot. But, I get it. I get it that others don't get it - and in some ways, I'm glad they don't have to suffer with certain realizations that we all in our Stage IV status cannot escape. Similar to you, Ms. M, I am planning next October to create one short post/fact about BC every few days on FB. I don't ever post about my specific situation there either, and have told others that I don't want them posting about it. I myself am ashamed and saddened that I didn't know the facts about MBC before having it. I went 12 years (that I know of) NED, and I hadn't a clue. If I can somehow help one other person in my years (hopefully) left on this earth, understand the true nature of breast cancer, I will certainly try. Thanks again ladies for putting up with my rant.

It's been on my 'favorites' for almost 2 yrs. now, as I was dx'd with mets to lungs and bones in Oct. of 2012. And yet, I've been too scared to read this particular board. The main reason my mets were discovered was due to a dry cough, that probably started around March of 2012, and shortness of breath, over a period of months. My shortness of breath really showed itself when I was talking a lot on the phone, or laughing. It would catch me then.  I have asthma, and bad allergies, and I really, truly thought that was it. It never entered my mind that it could be mets. I was 12.5 yrs. out from my first dx. I had just begun thinking I was 'safe.' It was only at my dh's urging that I finally went to a pulmonologist (mostly to prove him wrong - I knew he suspected cancer). I had a tumor over 2 centimeters, and bunch of other nodules on CT. A bronchoscopy later that same day confirmed breast cancer cells in my lungs. A PET scan the very next day showed the mets in my lungs, and also in my bones. I only found out recently, that they saw more bone mets than they initially reported on. So, it's basically in my entire spine, my sacrum, the neck of the femur and pelvis/iliac. I started Xeloda just a couple of weeks later (and am still on it), and experienced a pretty rapid improvement in my breathing and cough. After a few weeks on it, my shortness of breath completely disappeared as did the cough. Completely gone. I am very lucky to say, I've been holding steady ever since, and also am able to do all I was before. Sometimes, if I am congested, I have a wheeze that seems to emanate right from the area of the largest tumor. It freaks me out...as I had horrific asthma as a child and suffered greatly due to medical neglect (looooong story). So the sound of any kind of wheezing at all, pushes ALL of my fear buttons. When this wheeze happens to me occasionally, it's a reminder that the cancer is there, daring the air to get around that particular spot.  So- due to this childhood experience I had, which lasted for years, I am very frightened at even the THOUGHT of not being able to breathe properly, and all that will probably occur as this progresses. I feel like I need to start preparing myself mentally for this. Does everyone with lung mets eventually have a pleural effusion? Or multiple? I'm so afraid of this, obviously. I think I could handle almost anything else, but this possibility scares me so much. Thanks, LL",

Even at one point, she was talking to herself saying, \"I'm going to die...I mean, everyone is going to die, but I'm going to die today, and I know it.\" That's what we live with as MBC patients. Not literally dying today, this moment...but far, far sooner than we should compared to the average life span. That's the flip side of, \"Well, anyone could get hit by a bus tomorrow...\" Maybe. But it's different when you see the bus barreling down on you, and your feet are stuck in the cement of the roadway, etc. So - when she was saying those lines, I was sitting there shaking my head, going, \"Yup - I know how you feel.\" Virginia - you are so right. There are always more than two choices. That's true. I have started (just scratching the surface, really) trying to evaluate my life, and all the major moving parts of it...work, who I'm friends with, how I spend my time, where I live, what I spend money on. I'm an analytical person, and I almost need to see all of this on paper to work through it, and come up with different (and perhaps more fulfilling) options for myself.  Brenda - your words resonate with me also. I've worked enough for two lifetimes already. I already wish I had worked less. I guess now, I'm asking myself in this moment, why am I not working less right NOW. How much more time am I going to regret spending the 'wrong' way. I've been tossing around an option where I work like a dog for another year, get some things paid off, situated, then I stop. Being that I don't really have any savings, and the hubby doesn't even have a ton of 401K money for later in his life, I need to make a plan.  So many questions. I feel like I'm standing between two mirrors where your reflection goes on forever in either direction. Those are all the possible answers. It's overwhelming. Thank you so much for helping me think these things through. Your perspective is so enormously helpful. I haven't seen All is Lost...now I'm so curious about it!

This dream, the intensity of it, and the feeling of how real it seemed really hit me like no other dream I've ever had. When I remembered it spontaneously yesterday, for a few moments, I thought, \"Well, that's what it's going to be like\"...and for a moment, I was somewhat less actively scared about dying and the process of dying.  Like my mind was trying to prepare me for what will ultimately come. And then of course, by the time bed time came last night, I was apprehensive about going to sleep. I didn't want to have that dream again. Divine Ms. M - interesting on the dream interpretation book. I know for me, my subconscious was playing out the conscious thoughts I have hanging over my head in one form or another every day on this topic of dying.  Right now, I am at a cross roads in my life. I'm interviewing for a very high level position that has more visibility and responsibility than what I have now (which is considerable stress and long hours), but that would result in getting paid $20K-$25K more per year - which would REALLY help out with all the med bills, co -insurance and co-pays.  Under normal circumstances it would be a no brainer, and the position would be the culmination of my career, with me positioned quite well for a VP role within a year, maybe 2. And, the good news is, I've been stable on Xeloda for a year and 4 months. The bad news is also that I've been stable on Xeloda for a year and 4 months. When will the other shoe drop...before IV chemo. A year, six months, my next doc visit? And then what happens if I take this job and on and on. Or - do I spend my energy trying to get on disability somehow so that I can not have work stress, but live with huge financial stress? I guess in my mind, it's about embracing living vs. preparing for death. I know there's a grey area in there, but in option 1, I essentially ignore my dx, and soldier on while I can to make more money, easing the financial burden, but wasting long days in the office (which I'm doing now - just working from home - I HAVE to work...). Option 2 - is like what I imagine an old person doing when they give up their much loved family home, their belongings, and move into a nursing home. I would have to walk away from my house, boat, lifestyle - everything I've worked for my whole life, just to make it without my income. I came 1) from nothing and 2) a very abusive and neglectful childhood. So yes, while these are just things, I'm having trouble letting go. I am 47, and I don't know how to do anything else but work, and work harder. There is no crystal ball for what the right answer is, and so my brain has been very occupied with trying to assess the relative risks, pros and cons with each move.  It's hard to do this objectively, when a huge chunk of this is figuring in a terminal illness, and limited time on this earth - in the sense of, if I screw this up, if I make the wrong choice, I don't get a do over in another 10 yrs...there is no more 40 yr. life span left for me. This is IT. I'm dealing with a lot of \"lasts\" - for example, if I sell my house to be closer to this new job, this is honestly the last house I will ever live in. When my dog who is 14 passes away, she is the last dog I will ever have. So many lasts, so much finality. More of what I believe to be a future just evaporating in front of my eyes. Kind of like in the movie Back to the Future, where Michael J. Fox keeps seeing pix of his brother and sister fading before his eyes, and he is trying desperately to fix it. What nobody ever tells you is that the death sentence is only the half of it. It's living with that knowledge every day, and passing for normal that breaks me down.  I think this is why I had the dream. Things I've shut out of my brain for the last year and 4 months are now whispering, \"You can't ignore me forever. You don't have forever.\" One final thing I will add - because it's what triggered the dream memory yesterday - was that I was watching the movie Gravity. If you have seen it, everything that Sandra Bullock goes through, all the impossible circumstances and frustrations just when she thinks she's finally made headway at so many different points, really resonated with me. To me, the space debris was like breast cancer coming out of nowhere and ripping a hole in the fabric of your life in an instant. The terror she portrayed was exactly how I felt on the inside both when I first had cancer, and when getting this latest diagnosis. Once I saw that connection - the entire move was a metaphor for this life. I'd like to point to it, to show my friends who don't/can't understand this and say, \"See?? See that?! THAT's how I feel. This is what cancer had done to me!\" Thanks again so much to each of you. Every since I've had this dream, and read yours, I am curious about the issues our minds work on in our sleep. Just goes to show, you can repress things for so long, and eventually, it pops out somewhere.",

I'm thinking definitely a year (as evidenced by the non-stop cough that finally got me in to the doc), and maybe 2. Having said that - I have seen women on these boards blow past those dates, and sadly, have seen women take a sudden, unexpected turn for the worse 2 or 3 years out. So, I look at it this way - there is no way for me to know, so I am trying to live my life in the \"now\" instead of constantly fretting about when I will die from this. That was nearly impossible early on...all I could think about was my death. Since I was dx'd in Oct. 2012, it's gotten much better, and I've come to accept the fact that there are so many unknowns.",

What I can't tell from the article is if only some cancers have this 'something' - say, based on genetics or what. Does anyone else have any insight into this latest news? Reading the article made me want to drop everything and go ask for a prescription for Antabuse! But the drug CANNOT be mixed with alcohol of any type - EVEN topically, say in a lotion or whatever. Of course, that means you could never have a beer or a glass of wine, EVER EVER EVER (or risk a near fatal or fatal reaction).

But, of course, I'm freaked out because of the ONJ and shortness of breath in particular. I have lung mets, and have just started breathing really well again, and the last thing I need is for Xgeva to take that away. Also - what benefit do you feel Xgeva has given or is giving you? Is it really worth the risk of the SEs? My onc didn't mention a thing about taking calcium and vitamin D while taking Xgeva, which has me nervous now about him. Why wouldn't he mention that?? I mean, it says one should take both right on their website! Am I making a mountain out of a molehill? Also, onc STILL doesn't have the her 2 receptor status from my bronch. They didn't test for it the first time (don't know why). He said he asked for it to be done. That was a month ago. He told me I should ping the pulmonologist to see if he had gotten an addendum.

But I saw an ad for that kind of an early payout thingee last night in Cure Magazine online, and I thought, \"Wow - they've thought of everything!\" The ad was a little creepy, honestly - but I get it that if I had a policy I could cash in, that would be pretty awesome to know! (And who knows these things until you have to??). Thanks again, ladies. I learn new things every day around here.",

Many of us were cancer free for many years before getting this diagnosis. So my miracle threshold is a bit higher these days.

Please don't go googling survival times on the internet, because it will only scare you. The statistics out there are OLD, and don't include anyone who's had the latest and greatest treatments.

Can a person be on short term disability/long term disability AND be receiving SSDI benefits? I guess I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to bridge the 6 month waiting period with the Short Term Disability benefit from an employer? Or - for that matter, if one can have them overlap once the SSDI starts? Also - does just having the Stage IV dx automatically get you approved for SSDI (and/or short term disability) , or must one \"prove\" in addition that they can no longer work due to physically or mental issues? If so, how does that work? One thing I learned today: You can go to the Social Security website, create a login, and get an estimate of what you're monthly payment would be (specifically based on YOUR income history). I also learned that the SSDI benefits basically last until you reach retirement age - then are called retirement benefits (not sure if amount changes at that point, though). So, for me, being 46 now, soon to be 47, it's not realistic that I'll hit retirement age, so the SSDI benefits once started would be there for me for the rest of my life at the amount approved.

I understand now about the back pay as well - thanks so much! I agree with Chefmiche - it would be great to have someone tell us all these things when we are ready to hear them. It seems that everyone shares by word of mouth, but just having things spelled out in one place would be so helpful. I've also started telling DH these things. While sometimes it's really hard for me to talk about, it's also good that we can begin to make plans. I just don't want to leave him with a boat load of debt. Having had my original bout with BC 13 yrs. ago, I always used to get the most life insurance possible at any job. In the past few years, I had stopped that practice, thinking, \"I'm probably fine now. Why spend the extra money?\". Well, this is exactly why. Oh - I could just KICK myself for that. I suppose I could get another job, and go to the max on the life insurance - but that seems like such a lot of effort right now. ",

Can a person be on short term disability/long term disability AND be receiving SSDI benefits? I guess I'm trying to figure out if it's possible to bridge the 6 month waiting period with the Short Term Disability benefit from an employer? Or - for that matter, if one can have them overlap once the SSDI starts? Also - does just having the Stage IV dx automatically get you approved for SSDI (and/or short term disability) , or must one \"prove\" in addition that they can no longer work due to physically or mental issues? If so, how does that work? One thing I learned today: You can go to the Social Security website, create a login, and get an estimate of what you're monthly payment would be (specifically based on YOUR income history). I also learned that the SSDI benefits basically last until you reach retirement age - then are called retirement benefits (not sure if amount changes at that point, though). So, for me, being 46 now, soon to be 47, it's not realistic that I'll hit retirement age, so the SSDI benefits once started would be there for me for the rest of my life at the amount approved.

The idea of \"chemo-native\" cells also explains (in my mind) why so many of the Stage IV at initial dx report so many wonderful stories of NED/stable on the 'remission' thread. I honestly never knew that the cancer cells mutate over time, and create new pathways to sustain themselves until very recently, and your post really underscores that point. I think your statement, \"We don't get to know our stories until we live them.\" really resonates with me. All the studies in the world about other people cannot predict the course of my particular permutations of the disease, or how it will all unfold. I cannot tell you the immense sense of peace that your informative post has given me. I think I can mentally put this aside now, and just do the best I can, each day, trust my onc., and be grateful for every good physical day (year(s)??) I have. Truly, thank you - you have no idea how much better knowing this information makes me feel. Ebru - thank you also for your very kind words. Heidi - thanks so much for the summary of those guidelines. This lets me know that there truly is no set in stone \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to do things. This will help me sleep at night. And thank you to all the other sisters in this discussion.

Lauriesh - I think you captured what I was trying to say perfectly...by \"aggressive\", I meant, treating for \"curative intent\". I was wondering if there are studies that show that \"throwing everything but the kitchen sink at it\" actually equates to longer stable times, NED achievement and thus, longer life with good QOL...OR - if it's more of a crap shoot because of the nature of cancer itself and the moving target it is...i.e., some get very, very lucky with NED for a period of years, and some just don't, regardless of what is tried. It just really struck me how many women on the remission thread were dx'd at Stage IV to begin with, so I wondered if there was some common thread there that could explain the excellent response. I have mets in both lungs, the hilar nodes my right lung, and my bones, in 5 places. So, I don't think I'd fit the criteria of having one small met as Coolbreeze and Kayrnic mentioned. I think the cat, indeed is out of the bag. I am on chemo now, Xeloda, and also Tamoxifen, and I think my problem is that it doesn't \"feel\" like chemo to me yet. I mean, I still and will have my hair for God's sake. And yes, I'm very grateful for that, becaue I know it's other SE's will come. I've read probably hundreds of posts on these boards about Xeloda. I don't know - I think I'm trying to think my way out of this somehow, find the magic key, the perfect amount of knowledge to make the right decisions about my treatment. You all have raised very good points about the awful SE's of some of the chemo's out there. I hadn't thought of that. I think this whole line of thinking on my part is my desperate attempt to somehow come to terms with this. This week has been hard on me emotionally. Lots of weepy moments where I am overcome and overwhelmed by the utter sadness of this. I feel my life is one of those sand clocks, and I'm watching it slip through grain by grain, and when it's up, it's just going to be up, and there's not a damn thing I can do about it. And then sometimes, I feel so completely normal, I mean, no one zapped me with lightning at dx, the earth didn't open up and swallow me. I'm still me, but I have this time bomb on the inside, and it's just hard to wrap my brain around. I think had they not done the bronchoscopy, and had I not read the path report myself, I would not have been entirely convinced it was mets. Denial is a powerful thing. Anyway - sorry for babbling. Like I said, it's been a tough week. I am so very happy for the ladies who are currently NED and/or stable. And I am so very, very heartbroken for the ladies who are progressing, and becoming more symptomatic. Love and light and great thanks again for your wisdom, and insight. Somehow, you have all made me feel better about this. LL",

They gave me Tamoxifen and chemo pills called Xeloda. I responded very well to the treatment, and I had a slight wheeze when first diagnosed, was short of breath, etc. I had no pleural effusion, but one of the tumors in my lung was pressing on my airway, causing the wheeze. It's a year later, and I no longer wheeze. My tumor markers have come way down. I think all things considered, I am in better physical health at this point with mets than I was when first diagnosed. The hormonal treatments can do wonders. Please know that this diagnosis is not an immediate death sentence. There are many options and treatments they can try to keep the cancer at bay for several years. If it were me, though, I would ask them about chemo plus the hormonal treatment given the progression she has had so far. Also - absolutely get a second opinion. There is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to do this, because as it turns out everyone's breast cancer is so different, and what works for one person may not work at all for another. So unfortunately, this is a bit trial and error. The biggest thing is for her to feel comfortable with her doctors. You are such a caring daughter for seeking information here.

I started taking Tamoxifen in October of 2012, when diagnosed with mets, having not hit menopause yet (my periods never stopped, even through the original chemo). Though my onc now says that taking my ovaries out isn't \"necessary\", I'm not too sure about that. I never wanted to do it before, because, honestly, after being NED for 12.5 years, I thought I was fine, and no need to do yet another awful surgery. The other thing is, I'm scared to death of the menopause symptoms. Weight gain, vaginal dryness, forgetfulness, etc. But now I'm considering it, because now I'm having major fibroid problems on top of everything else, causing lots of pain. So, I'm beginning to think that perhaps it would be smart to have th ovaries out - get rid of all the estrogen that I can to (hopefully) improve my chances. I do feel that the Tamoxifen is helping me now. I had the \"classic\" tumor flare that one gets when starting Tamoxifen, which basically means you suddenly feel a lot more pain as the Tamoxifen is starving the tumors of estrogen. Also, I wasn't wheezy. But I did have a nasty, dry, unproductive cough, that I just ignored. For months. Once I started Tamoxifen and chemo, that cough went away.",

That's why I was so scared to death beforeI started taking my Xeloda this time around. I think getting scanned every 3 months is really smart. I cannot say I was that smart. I hadn't been to my onc in the past 4 (yes, that's not a typo) years before this dx. Basically because he never did anything. He would feel my lymph nodes for swelling, feel he remaining boob and push on my liver. He would then pronounce me ok. I really feel that I should've been having regular x-rays or scans or something. But I never asked for them, never pushed for them. And at the time, I read some studies that said that all that screening ultimately would not prolong life. So - I quit going, thinking that I was probably totally fine anyway - after all, it had been 12 years. So, now, with lung and bone mets, I sit and wonder how long they've been there, awake and growing? 1 Year, 2 Years? 6 months? It haunts me. But I guess what I have to get through my head is if my biology and genetics were set and primed to allow this cancer go metastatic, no amount of scanning in the world would've stopped that. Maybe it's good I didn't know, and had a few years of just normal living before stepping squarely on this pile of flaming crap at my front door. I find the stories of stability using just hormonals to be amazing. And wonderful. And it's given me so much hope. Thank you so much, LL",

So, I said, I think it's great you're going to look at all your options. She says...wait for it...\"Yeah, you and I will get through all this together!\" Um - no, no \"we\" won't. You have a sore back. I have terminal cancer in mine. I know this woman has a good heart, which is why I don't take her head off. She honestly has no idea how this sounds.

As if there is some magic formula...which, clearly there is not. Today, I watched Pink Ribbons, Inc. (for free on You Tube), and something that one of the women (Phd or MD's, I think) said, really was timely in terms of this discussion we're having. She was talking about how Komen pushes early detection via mammo as a virtual guarantee that you will be \"cured\". She said the reality is that there are basically 3 groups, 1) those who get the mammo, and cancer is discovered, they get treatment, and then go on to live normal lives with a normal life span 2) those who get 'something' discovered in the breast, who are treated aggressively who then suffer unnecessary side effects because the something would've never progressed anyway and 3) those who will die of cancer anyway eventually, no matter what - and it doesn't really matter WHEN it's found. That last one really stuck with me. I mean, certainly chemo can slow the cancer down, but bottom line is, there is no cure, there are no guarantees, no magic. Strangely, it made me actually feel better to hear that, because I'm coming to realize it's nothing that I did or didn't do to 'get' breast cancer in the first place, so it would be silly to think that I could possibly figure out how to crack the code on how to bargain with it for more life. It just is. And rather than feeling resigned to that, it's actually a bit freeing in a strange way. I can stop obsessing, and just try to live the best I can.

What a mentally exhausting process. Now that I have posted here for a year, even when I take a break, I will always come back to let others know I'm still here. For all I know, someone is watching my date, the characteristics of my cancer, looking for hope. I was diagnosed Stage IV last October - October 16th to be exact, after 12.5 years after Stage IIA treatment. I will say technically dx'd also, because it's clear to me that the cough that finally made me go to the doctor was a symptom of my lung mets. And that started bothering me in March/April of 2012. And it's in my bones too - so, who knows how long I've actually been walking around with it. I've had terrible back pain in L5 for several years - probably 5, that's so much reduced now that I'm on chemo, it's crazy. It's scary when I think of it that way, because if I optimistically give myself 10 yrs. after Stage IV dx, and let's say I've already had it at least 2 yrs...well then. If I go more with averages of say, somewhere between 3-6 yrs, well.....yeah. Frightening. And I'm not trying to freak myself out, I'm just trying to deal with facts as best I can. It's a control thing. (Yeah, right, I know...). Of course, no one can predict the future and all that, but I'd just feel so stupid if it (death) totally snuck up on me. Almost as stupid as I felt when mets snuck up on me. I think it's important to remember that we are only a subset of the men and women living with Stage IV. Some go to other boards. Some may not post to the internet at all. So, all we have for a sample size is us. I don't know if you all have heard of this or not, but I recently joined the \"Army of Women\" (Avon and Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation), to answer their questionnaires. My hope is that if enough of us do this, maybe, MAYBE they will be able to begin making correlations that will lead to meaningful results. I figure I'm already a guinea pig, so why not.

And that feeling only intensified at year 11, then year 12. Than BLAMMO! - Wrong. Here it was in my lungs and bones. And truly, I think it was actually there at least all of 2012 - I had a persistent cough that showed up around March/April of that year that just got worse. And if we say that generally, it spreads to bones first - who knows when it actually woke up in my body before I got to the point of the coughing and shortness of breath. 2011? 2010? Earlier? Sometimes it makes me crazy - so I just can't think about it. Because when I try to guess when I actually had mets vs. when I was dx'd with them - then I start my death count from that first possible date vs. the dx date! So - gee, let's see, 2010 + 10 years tops would give me possibly 6 more years. See? Crazy. I also do this in the other direction...looking forward to all I will not be here for. The marriage of my son - the birth of his children, growing old with my dear husband of 18 years. I've learned that there's a name for this, called \"anticipatory grief\". I can add it to my list of neuroses. I try to live as normally as I can, and I'm trying to mentally prepare myself for the inevitable. I went through a stage where thinking of death, and not just in the abstract sense of death, but in a very detailed, visceral way - i.e., will I be alert at the moment of death? Will I be struggling to try to live, as the lights are shutting out one by one? How frightened will I be. I still think of this - but try not to dwell on it too much. I try to instead learn about how actively dying people are cared for, and I honestly hope by that point I'm on a major morphine drip, and don't know what's happening so I'm not too scared. Oh - it just all sucks. And no one can understand any of this except for you ladies. In the meantime - I try to live my life as normally as possible. I have pretty significant bone pain and joint pain so my dh does most everything around the house so as not to flare up my pain. I am also very fortunate that I've been on Xeloda with zero HFS for a year and a half, and I've been stable this whole time. I'm very scared of the harsher chemos in my future.",

At the time, it wasn't totally clear if the tumor was inside the airway, or pushing on it, so he wanted to do the bronchoscopy to see. So anyway, turns out that the cells he got from the airway itself through lavage, and from a needle biopsy did show positive for breast cancer cells. He said afterward that the tumor was pressing on the airway, and so, was very difficult to capture those cells. I do feel good that I got that bronchoscopy, because without it, honest to god, I think I'd doubt the diagnosis. Like, how do they KNOW. Even though my CT scan had also said mets all over it.

I'm not sure though, that there is a way he can know proactively which treatment (chemo and/or hormonal) is likely to hold back the cancer. From what I've learned here, what you describe, taking chemo until there is progression, and then switching, is pretty much the norm for us Stage IV ladies. I don't think it's because they don't want to help us - but because they simply don't know what will help (or not) until they try it on us. (Such is the need for a whole lot more research focusing on metastatic disease...). I think with early stage, pretty much whatever they throw at us is going to work (even for a brief time in some cases). With our stage, we just don't know, and I think at our stage, our cancers have gotten craftier at finding ways around chemo and hormonals. The cells find other pathways to live - making the whole thing more confusing and challenging. When my pulmonary doc told me I had a 3.8 mass in my lung, I was like, \"Well, take it OUT!!!\" When he said no, because it was also all throughout my lungs, and my bones, I understood that the surgery would be very invasive and traumatic, and wouldn't prolong my life, but would cause me a whole lot more suffering. The onc said the same thing about surgery. It's just such a different ball game at Stage IV. It's taken some time to wrap my head around that - but I do feel more calm now, and that my onc is making good decisions. At first, like you, I wasn't so sure. But after reading so many others' experiences here, and seeing that they are so much like my own in terms of treatment plan, I think we are all doing everything possible to be here as long as possible with as much quality of life as possible.

Right now, I believe in my heart that I will live 10 yrs. out from dx. I don't know why - I just do at this point. Maybe they call that denial. And even thinking that I only have 10 years (well, 9 now) is hard enough. If I could live 20 years (I know - I'm getting greedy), it would just be amazing. But look at JenninMichigan, she's been NED now for FIVE yrs! That is so amazing to me. Fitz - you are an inspiration. I just hate so much (as we all do) how arbitrary and unpredicatble this all is.

Another exploratory surgery later and all of that pathology was clean. So, no more endo cancer. And, I think I've been pretty lucky with menopause symptoms. Having said all that, I am very fortunate to feel pretty normal. My breathing and incessant dry cough got better, then disappeared on Xeloda. I was having shortness of breath too, and a slight wheeze, which just scared the hell out of me, but no more. Xeloda has done wonders for me. I can only hope that it keeps working for a long time.

It was hard enough then with a stage II diagnosis, I don't have a lot of advice as to dealing with Stage IV with small children. One great thing, is that if it's in your bones only - there are many stories of women who can live with it for years. This is not an instant death sentence (though I know for me, in the beginning, it certainly felt like it). Maybe a therapist could help? Someone removed from \"school\", etc.  So sorry that you have joined us - but we are here for you... LL",
