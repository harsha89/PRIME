Taking hormone therapy to prevent recurrence of Dcis needs to be a balance between risks and benefits. If your side effects are causing you considerable problems then maybe it is time for a rethink. Dcis is never life threatening and if you get a recurrence most of the time the recurrence will be more dcis. Assuming you are having regular mammograms even if you had a recurrence (dcis or idc) it is likely it would be picked up at a very early stage and be treatable. I was offered tamoxifen but decided not to take it for the reasons described above.My surgeon was keen for me to take it but oncologist felt it was overkill. No one can tell you if you will be one of the few unlucky people, but I sure wouldn't want to spend the next few years miserable with side effects for a small improvement in recurrence rates for something that is unlikely to threaten your life. This is my personal opinion and others may have a different view.  My advice would be to get a second opinion and review of your personal recurrence rates.",
