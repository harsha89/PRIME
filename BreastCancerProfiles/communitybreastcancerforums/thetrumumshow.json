In January my mammogram showed \"changes\" so I was called in for Core Biopsy which showed all sorts of atypical cell changes including radial scar, adenosing sclerosis.... So my Consultant decided to do another WLE to get a definitive diagnosis. This was performed on February 29th and the Pathology report has showed DCIS in the margins. It is ER positive, PgR positive and HER2 positive. My Consultant is recommending Mastectomy as she feels that my breast may well develop an Invasive Cancer in the future and that she's not sure how much of the breast is affected by the DCIS. It seems very drastic to me to remove my breast. Does anyone else have experience of similar surgery for a similar diagnosis? Has anyone else undergone any other form of treatment for this?

      "Content": "thetrumumshow wrote: Hi there from the UK!!!  I'm thinking that as my Surgeon has recommended I have a Mastectomy for DCIS I'll go woth the DIEP flap reconstruction.  However, I have several questions and I'm hoping that some of you lovely ladies on the other side of the pond can answer them for me. 1. How long does the surgery take? 2. What is the immediate post-op recovery like?  Following my last WLE I awoke with the worst thirst ever and a very sore throat. 3.  How long do you have to stay on bed-rest for? 4. How much pain is there? 5. How long do the drains stay in for? 6.  How much did it restrict movement?  Did the Surgeons say not to do certain things? 7.  What about the girdle thingy?  And support bra?  How easy were they to live with? 8.  What about going back to work?  I'm a Nurse so working in a very busy environment? I could go on.....  And I'm sure I'll think of other questions as time goes on.  I just wish my 2nd opinion appointment would materialise, I've been waiting 4 weeks now.  HELP!!!!!!  Trudie Dx 3/11/2008, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
