    "Content": "pocket wrote: Hi! I am hoping someone out there can give me some advice or information about what i can do legally about having an infected port. My story goes like this, in July 2012 I was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. In Aug i had a Bard Power Port put in, I had my first chemo treatment in Aug,second treatment in Sept. I was scheduled for the 3rd treatment in Oct but by Oct 1st i was admitted to the hospital. They removed the port as it had gotten infected which in turn gave me septicemia/staff infection that almost  killed me. The infection ran through my bloodstream causing damage to and creating a hole in the mitral valve in my heart. I had to have blood and one test after the other as well as a small heart attack, several different issues so after 27 days in the hospital on antibiotics every 4 hours i was released to go home with an IV antibiotic for 6 more weeks then another 6 weeks after that of oral antibiotic.  I feel like i deserve some sort or retribution from having all of this happen to me due to the port getting infected and i have hunted for attorney's to tell me whether or not i even have a case but everyone i have called turns me down saying one reason or another.Is there anyone out there that knows what i have to do to get this information,which way do i turn? anything at all would be greatly appreciated, thanks barbara Log in to post a reply",
