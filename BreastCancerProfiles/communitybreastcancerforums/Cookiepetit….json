In December a small mass area was removed and Dec 27,2016. I was in the hospital that same day for gross hematuria in my urine. I was in the hospital for 12 days. No specialist was able to find the reason, but while I was in the hospital I had a oncologist come to my room to do special blood work and to give me the news that I also was diagnosed with BC stage 1. Today was my 1st day of radiation after 2 months of waiting. I finally started. I know I'm not crazy but I felt the like a squeeze on my chest as soon as it started not knowing they have started. Also I did feel nausea for a little bit and of course I was a little emotional because reality kicked in. I have a count down 32 more treatments to go. Best wish all the ones going through this. ðŸ’–",
