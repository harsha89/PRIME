In Sept. I was diagnosed with DCIS in my right breast after an uneventful stereotactic CNB. I took my results to a local hospital with a well known breast cancer program for follow up with an oncologist. I started there with a bilateral MRI, after which I received a call letting me know that nothing new was found on the MRI but that the patholgists there disagreed with the DCIS dx and instead downgraded me to ADH. At that point, I couldn't see the doctors there, as I had gone outside my insurance network to see them (permitted if there is a cancer diagnosis but denied once I was downgraded). I picked up my slides, films and reports and took them to yet another hospital with a very well respected breast cancer center. The pathologists there agreed with the adh reading, but the radiologist found calcifications in the left breast that were missed by the first two hospitals. All of this lead to my second stereotactic CNB, which happened today. My first biopsy was relatively easy. In spite of my over the top anxiety, the procedure wasn't in the least painful. I didn't even feel the initial numbing injection, and it was over before I knew it. Fast forward to today\u2014the single most painful experience of my adult life (and I have three children, all delivered via c-sections and two following prolonged and intense labor). First, I felt everything. They gave me as much of the local as possible, and still I felt each sensation, from the stinging of the local to the injection of the needle for the samples. Each click for a sample almost made me rise off the table, and it took two nurses pressing down on my back to keep me in place. When they took the samples for an X-ray, they discovered they hadn't gotten any of the calcification. They once again tried to numb me, to some avail, and took another series of samples. The first three, as with the first biopsy, I didn't feel. The last one, however, almost made me faint with the pain. I was sobbing, in pain and embarrassed. I was told to sit up after the clip was placed, and blood just poured down over my belly and all over my leggings. It took almost 30 minutes to get the bleeding to stop enough to apply the steristrips. The doctor also had the nurse apply a pressure bandage and wrap me in an ACE, which I have to leave on for 24 hours. I was told I also have a large hematoma. Has anyone else experienced such a traumatic CNB? I am still in pain now, almost 12 hours later, and I'm already stressing about the results. At a minimum, I will be having surgery on the adh in the right breast, and I'm praying that the left breast holds nothing horrible. Sorry for the rambling, but the pain I experienced today caught me off guard! Most I've read reinforces my first, no-pain biopsy. Argh!!!!!!!!! Log in to post a reply",

So the next step is surgery on the ADH in the right breast. It is scheduled for Nov. 16. I was told I will report first to the breast center for insertion of a wire that will guide my surgeon to the excision site. Now I have a new reason to be anxious. The stereotactic CNB was so traumatic that I am BEYOND terrified of this wire insertion. I will be under a general for the actual surgery, but the wire thing sounds horrible! Any experience here? I don\u2019t know if I can handle two weeks of this worrying.",
