I, too, had one positive node and just to let you know my experience, I had both a low OncotypeDX score (16) and a really low Mammaprint result. With that, I sought out second opinion from a MO as my first MO originally didn\u2019t think the tests were necessary in my case (my orig MO did eventually order tests because I pushed so strongly). Long story short, after my test results came back, my orig MO ended suggesting no chemo (although said I could do TCx4 if I wanted) and my second opinion MO suggested chemo (same, TC), but was also ok to forego chemo and just get on hormonal therapy. Obviously two semi-conflicting suggestions but I guess nice to know I have an option? So I guess my point is that just because you had one positive node, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you need chemo or that it would be beneficial. I\u2019ve ran into others on the boards here who didn\u2019t go through chemo with 1+ LN. As for what I\u2019m going to do. Still waiting. My coworker\u2019s cousin used to work with and is neighbors with Laura Van\u2019t Veer, creator of Mammaprint. She\u2019s a world renowned molecular biologist and head of the breast oncology program at UCSF. I\u2019ve forwarded my path and both test results along and am awaiting her opinion. I obviously will weigh her opinion more heavily than my first two opinions. Hope your OncoDX comes back super low",

I know that waiting is so very hard, but pls try to stay positive! There\u2019s no good that comes from worrying yourself sick over things that are out of your control. Just know that even if your results come back positive, breast cancer is very treatable and in most cases, is caught early so keep that in mind. In most cases though, biopsies come back negative...so I\u2019m hoping and praying for that for all of you! Go out there and enjoy today! :)",

I remember all too well how nerve racking my biopsy daywas as well as the days I had to wait for my results. Hang in there, stay calm and think positive! Sending you all that are waiting warm wishes and good vibes.",

Inexpensive and super comfy. As I\u2019m sure most here can relate, I was having \u201cshape\u201d issues several weeks post surgery as I\u2019ve been in the process of filling my expanders and I got this super comfortable one which had light removable padding which evened out the oddities of my misshapen foobs (that also didn\u2019t irritate or rub against my incision from my Lymph node removal): https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/limited-time-offers/innerwear?quickView=404117 Almost done with fills (just one more to go), so the shapes have evened out a lot, but this was a godsend to me in the early days post-surgery. The only issue is that range of motion might be an issue as you have to pull it over (no zip). I actually sized up (usually a M, but got a L) and was able to pull it on from the bottom up (and pull off from the top down). Now that things are back to normal and my range of motion is 80-90%, I am using the other Uniqlo wireless bras. Super, super comfy and so glad to not be paying $$$$ for bras from Nordstroms or a specialty store for temporary use! Just thought I\u2019d pass this info along as these bras played an integral part of me feeling better and less self-conscious about my foobs. Hey, anything that makes these rocks in our chests feel more comfortable, right??? ;",
