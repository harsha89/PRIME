Game Plan:  AC followed by T - 4 treatments of each - Neulasta with all chemos and Herceptin to begin with Taxol (every three weeks).  After chemo treatments are finished, another another major surgery since my first surgery did not clear my margins by 30 days of radiation and Herceptin to continue for a year.  Hormone pills for five years following radiation treatments.  Is this too much? AC:  4 treatments of AC every two weeks.  Neulasta injection two days following each chemo. Taxol:  4 treaments every two weeks.  Neulasta injection two days following each chemo.  Herceptin Treatment begins with this chemo every three weeks.  So I will be getting Taxol, the Neulasta injection two days later and Herceptin. Another major surgery following the eight chemo treatments in order to get pre-existing cancer cells followed by radiation treatment followed by five years of hormone pills. This seems to be an awful lot of treatment.  What is your opinion?  Can anyone please tell me if they had any side affect to Herceptin?       Dx 12/2010, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, 2/10 nodes, ER-/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
