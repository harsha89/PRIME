I have worked with wound care products and personally believe that showering the irradiated area reduces the bacterial load on the skin and should help prevent infections later in treatment. My skin went really well through the treatment and I showered at least daily and moisturised 3x per day. I did shower with just warm water and patted the skin dry very gently. This is definitely an area that needs some research!",

I started off badly with a rash on day 2 due to the recommended moisturiser! I switched moisturisers and treated the rash. I now apply my moisturiser 3 times a day and drink plenty of water to keep hydrated. It is now 18/32 and all is going OK, maybe just slightly reddened skin. We all seem to react to the treatment so differently so I hope you're one of the lucky ones who breezes through. Yawls, totally agree about the melt down advice. At work I'm known for being calm and cool BUT when I got the rash on day 2 I was in a panic thinking of how bad it could get get by day 32. I think I also panicked hubby! This stuff is tough and we should let it all out now and then. Bilateral beauties, thanks for the pecs stretching advice. I've noticed the shoulder on the treatment side pulling in, probably a protection mechanism. Best wishes to all!",

My job is very demanding and the glass of wine (or two or three) was my way to relax in the evening. It was my only vice as I've been a healthy weight for 6 years, eat well, don't smoke and I was exercising hard. My tumour was ER+/ PR+ and I've read that alcohol causes estrogen levels to rise, in fact they think they know the mechanism. I thought about it hard and for me I decided to cut down but not stop completely as I wanted to enjoy an occasional drink with hubby or friends. Since just before my operation, I am now down to a glass of wine per week. I am missing the after work relaxation and the social aspect but it has been easier than I thought. As I said to hubby, it is amazing how a scare can make you change behaviour!",
