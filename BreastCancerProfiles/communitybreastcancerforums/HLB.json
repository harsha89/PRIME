I thought geez I don't need that much! Weird how he's reluctant about it but then writes it for more than enough. He refused to put refills on it saying \"you will come to grips with the new situation and you'll be ok\". Well I ran out and I wasn't ok so I called the nurse coordinator and it turned out he was on vacay, so she got another doc to write it and she put 4 refills on it thank God! I take one a day most of the time, sometimes 2. I think you have to experiment because it affects people differently. A friend of mine took a half mg before oral surgery and I picked him up afterwards and he was so messed up he peed his pants. It doesn't make me act weird at all. Sometimes I fall asleep but sometimes I don't. I can tell when I need one because I get short of breath. I don't get worried about addiction either. My goal is a happy like with no stress or anxiety. Whatever it takes. Anxiety and stress is not good for our cancer.",

I've read good things about both of these things. ALA is a supplement available at vitamin stores and I would think any dr could precribe the LDN if you think he's a rip off. I think its worth a try. I saw a post someone wrote about reading his book and then treating herself with these 2 things as well as baking soda. I have bs and maple syrup on hand. Haven't tried it yet but what the heck, its cheap! I would try anything out there that won't hurt! I'm taking essiac tea and my dad just ordered me a rife machine.

It seems to me that its assumed I won't be cured so we save the rads for when I need them, like if they become painful. However, I think if the mets are limited, like if you only have 2, some people think its worth it to treat aggressivly to go for a possible cure, or at least a long time ned. I think I would look into another opinion just to see what they say. There's a guy at U of FL in Gainsville who is doing SBRT for 10 or less lesions going for the cure. It sounds like a really good treatment and there's a video on youtube all about it. His name is Paul Okenuiff (sp) Okunieff(?). I have all the info and keeping it on the back burner. I also would wonder like someone said above, why do the rads to the breast now that it has spread. It seems like its either backwards or maybe both sould be done...or no rads at all. Anyway about that sbRT, its very precise to the point where you get 5-10 tx instead of 30. The machine moves with your breathing and everything. Its called a VERO machine. At the time I was looking into it there were only 2 VERO, one in Gainsville and one in Jacksonville. He thinks people with limited mets should at least be given a chance at cure and he wants to change the definition of what is considered incurable. In the video there's a guy who had lung cancer, about 8 lesions I think. He was NED 8 years after getting the treatment. Don't know if he still is but heck 8 years after lung ca is pretty amazing.",

The good thing is he does have a job that he never misses a day and is doing very well there. I have my opinions about the way he was brought up but I can't do anything about that except try to have as much good influence as I can. Usually it seems like it's in one ear and out the other, but someday he will remember the things I try to teach him, the same way I remember all of the things my parents taught me. I might be gone by that time but it's not important that I see it happen. Kids are so hard these days. I think they always were but nowadays we worry that they will lose their very lives by learning everything the hard way. I think it's been awhile but I just saw this post.

If you exhale really hard, like push the air out, that will maybe let you get a deep breath. Works for me. It feels like the breath goes halfway down and just stops and won't go any deeper into the lungs. Sometimes get an irregulat heartbeat from it too. Just wanted to reassure you not to think the worst about mets. Also maybe the xanax isn't the right one for you. I don't know how it compares to ativan or if its similar.

I know a lot of people do lemon or the drops like I am doing but it seems that is a completely different thing than the machines. The vitamin C comparison doesn't really work though because I'm guessing the vit c creates alkalinity when its in the body because all citrus fruits are listed as alkaline forming on the food charts. The way things work in the body is far too complex for me to make sense of so its hard to say either way. I don't a simplified explanation is convincing for or against. I using RO water and the drops are just a bunch of minerals like calcium, magnesium, selenium. I don't think its going out of the healthy range but the RO is only around 4-5. I think more research is needed. I'm under the impression that certain minerals are good in the water, but the machines are just doing something electrical to it. Oh well I will never afford one anyway so I will put lemon in the water. At least I'm pretty sure of the benefits on that one.",

I use whey protein powder in my smoothies as well as chia seeds. I don't feel deprived at all, esp because I have my cheat day to look fwd to, and moms dinner is not unhealthy. When I do cheat, I NEVER touch soda no matter what! I also take a lot of supplements and alternatives. No scientific proof but I am convinced it will work and I met a lady who does these things and healed herself. Its true that there's so much info out there and so much is contradictory. I just figure it out the best I can and what I'm doing helps me emotionally as much as physically.",

Two moderately avid and one intense. switched to aromasin but I am too afraid of the Afinitor. I am looking into getting radiation in Florida where they use the Vero machine. my onc is totally against it. in my case I do not think I have the option to say on the leteozole because the tm is up to about 150, so its not as iffy as your situation. I thought if I tried Ibrance I could dtay on the letrozole but my onc is very rigid and would not consider it. the only other choic offered was a study of Faslodex with or without afinitor, but he leaned against it because would not b sure to get the Afinitor. the way I look at is that avarything stayed dormant except these three mets so if I can kill them maybe I can stay that way for a while and stay with an easy systemic treatment. Its very difficult to make these kind of decisions. I am nervous about taking only the aromasin s did go to a holistic dr and he precribed metformin, celebrex, meriva and melatonin, which all have been shown to have activity against cancer but not neccesarily in humans. Time will tell. I hope you will keep us posted with what you decide.Â ",

For example there's a guy with met prostate ca. He's having a bad time vomiting a lot, so I want to tell him about the drugs he could ask the dr about.

Mom has a friend who is also my friend who is a very nice lady but a bit of a meddler, always trying to bring people together. Tried to hook me up with her step son years ago. Now she's trying to hook me up with her hairdresser who recently finished tx for a lower stage breast ca. I said she's welsome to call me if she wants to but really, I would not want to if I was her. I tried to explain the difference to her. Then a few months later she tells me, oh my friend is going to call you but she's ok now and she's just not ready for that yet. Um yeah, that's what I tried to tell YOU! Wish she would just butt out. Anyway the prostate guy is a bit irritating because I spent a few hours researching the other night and wrote a bunch of stuff down for him. I get frustrated when people won't get a 2nd opinion but I just have to let it go as its their decision of course. Sorry, that was a ramble and didn't even answer the question! I get cards that say thinking of you and I guess the best way to reach out without being pushy.",

I have been to Tiffin, Willard, Gallipolis, Defiance,Lima. I can't remember the names but many of the small towns.

Caryn I know, its weird and I was really looking fwd to the cajun food I had heard so much about. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things. Jambalya-yuk. Shrimp with heads-yuk! I got crab cakes and they were completely different from the ones I had had; something different was in them and not very good. I gave up on the local food and ordered hot wings at one place but they didn't even have celery and bleu cheese to go with it, which always comes with wings here. I went there with three other girls and we had a reservation at an old fancy looking hotel in the French Quarter. When we opened the door to the room the first thing we saw was a 3 inch long roach scurry behind the curtain! They offered us another room which 2 of the girls the agreed to, and the other girl said \"I don't want to stay in this building!\" And I agreed! They were really nice and found us a room at the Holiday Inn Express only a block or two away. Apparently anyplace in the FQ will have that problem; just the nature of the place no matter how much they try to control it.",

A friend of mine recently had a big shocker like this; she had 2 small lung mets which resolved quicly on femara and stayed that way for about 2 years. About two weeks after her most recent good scan that was showing everything good, she started getting dizzy. Had another scan and all of a sudden there were mets in brain, lung, liver, bones, and lymph nodes! She had wbr and the brain is completely resolved. Switched to faslodex and everything else is resolved except one or two lymph nodes. When you get the right treatment it doesn't seem to matter how bad it seems. She doesn't even have any late effects of the wbr. I would definitely check into MDA or at least a 2nd opinion somewhere, just to see what more than one dr thinks should be done.",

I don't have pain from my bone mets so I don't know what that is like, but can they put you on XGEVA or one of thise types of drugs for the bones? and what about hormone therapy. sorry if you have already tried those. I thought I read somewhere that bone mets rarely kill anyone. Is it because nothing will work without taking the herceptin as well? I would want to try some knid of heart drug to maybe help get back on the H. Not very knowledgable about that either, sorry. Just seems like there has to be SOMETHING to take because I was under the impression that bone mets were relatively easy to treat and that it may get more difficult with the organs. Just speaking in general on that. Â I hope they can get your pain under control quickly, but from what I have been reading you really have to stay bugging them to try things until something works good. I agree that you should certainly not give up on going to that wedding! If nothing elase, maybe one of the ReDO projects meds would help, like metformin. I forget the names of all of them but one is tagamet and theres a deworming medicine. I know I am sounding goofy now. look up ReDO project, lots of info if you're interested in trying something else. take it easy, Heidi",

And yes I think the dr should be the one finding out about the her2 for you, not have you making phone calls for him. Geez. But I guess you may as well just do it yourself if you don't want to pull teeth. Mine is the same way sometimes. He tells me to call the nurse coordinator to find out my tm results. I have acess to my records because I'm a coder at the hospital so I just look it up. But I do wonder, doesn't he even wonder what's going on?! I know he's extremely busy but sometimes its a little worrisome that if something goes crazy he would just wait til my next appt rather than alerting me and doing something about it.

This is how to be prepared for chemo: if you are having a limited number of treatments (4 or 8) scedule them all in advance to make sure there's an opening on your day of the week and a better chance of getting the time you want. At the first one, take a tablet and write down what time treatment started. Then write in it for the rest of the day whatever you are feeling, what meds you took, what you ate etc, all with the time of day it happened. This really helped me because I took the anti nausea med that night at the time they told me to, and 45 min later I felt sick for hours til I finally slept. The next time I took it one hour earlier and never felt sick again. Its good to keep the diary for the first few days because you can refer back to it to see how things went on the 2nd and 3rd day and so on. If there were any issues the nurses usually had suggestions.",

One time it was about a half hour and I don't know why. My shot appts are made for 5 pm which is the latest appt I can get, and for some reason the nurses will discuss back and forth who wants to do it and is there anyone that can do it etc. I don't understand this because it literally takes one minute to administer. Guess I don't understand the nursing world. When I used top go to the hospital to work on charts, many times patients wouuld call out to me for water. I would let the nurse know (who was usually sitting at her station doing nothing) and the nurse would always say \"his nurse will be back in a few minutes, I will tell her\" or \"his nurse is with a patient right now\" etc. It was frustrating. It seems they will not under any circumstances help a pt that is not assingned to them. I'm sure there's a good reason but it wouldn't hurt to know simple basics about each pt so they wouldn't have to wait for certain kinds of help.",

I recently had a root canal/crown with no problems. My onc says this drug prevent cancer from growing. I am a little concerned about the long term effects I asked him about 2 years ago if I should go to every other month but he said no. He's very big on this drug. There is an oral care protocol I found about that I experimented with for 6 month now. You can find it by searching for \"Dr Ellie\". My last cleaning went well and was slightly improved from the last one. What I didn't tell them was that during those 6 months I hardly ever flossed! That is part of the protocol, that you don't need to floss and she thinks it can damage gums, but I will go back to flossing anyway now the experiment is over. Basically you do this morning and night: rinse with Closys, brush with Crest Anticavity (no glycerin), rinse with Listerine, then rinse with Act..05 percent flouride. Then you eat zylitol mints or gum throughout the day, esp after eating.",

What happened was my lump was excised because she was concerned about puncturing my lung due to the location, and because she didn't think it would turn out to be cancer anyway. Well it was and when I had the second surgery which was a lumpectomy, the path report noted cancer in the scar of the skin from the first excision. After that I had bad margins so I had to have a mastectomy which I had to a full additional month for. Now I wonder if that could be why I ended up with mets 8 years later. Two excisions that did not get all of it and I assume disrupted the cancer with all that cutting. Who knows.",

One was Graviola and the other was called Ntense, which had graviola as well as some additional ingredients. Thanks. I hope Deb checks in again soon :-(",

I called thel last night and the lady had a neuroendocrine tumor of the uterus that spread to the bladder 11 years ago. It was bad and they told her 3 to 6 months. I am going up there next saturday to visit my cousins and she is going to make copies of stuff and tell me where she gets stuff, etc, and I'm going to talk to her husband. He was the one who did all the research. Basically she did it with good diet and she mentioned essiac tea as one of the things she does but I didn't get many details since I am going there. She mentioned the importance of alkaline diet. Maybe it doesn't work for everyone but it definitely works for some, so don't be saying you will die in a very short time!! I will pass on whatever info I get to anyone who wants it. I know there are no guarantees but I feel really positive having spoken with someone who did this stuff and it actually worked. I feel peaceful and like everything will be back to normal and this cancer won't get me. I'm excited to meet them and wish I didn't have to wait a week! Ebru did you find out how your scan was yet?",

Well my mom and I stood in front of the mirror to look for the first time, and we were both like \"wow, that's not bad at all!\" After that it never bothered me again and it was actually kind of a fun process to get the fills every wEek. Each time a little closer to being back to normal! I was still upset that they didn't give me some ativan before surgery. I talked to 3 different ps before I found the one I liked and I knew it right away. There wasn't anything wrong with the other 2 mind you, it was just a feeling. Its so important to be completely confident and at ease with the surgeon. It sounds like you didn't have a nice one. They really need to be nice, imo, no matter how good a surgeon they are. I was so emotional that if someone was not nice as pie to me I got irritated and upset. Even if they weren't mean, just indifferent! Anyway, regardless of your bad experience, I would look at this as the total opposite. Not getting cancer surgery but getting a new breast and moving on, no hassles with prosthetics and clothes. I find it so convenient. No bras, just throw on a shirt! Good luck and peace to you. HB",

Now with this liver thing I'm wondering if I was too complacent and everything is going to crap very suddenly. Start abraxane mon and just hope it fixes whatever is wrong.Â  I do remember many others telling me that ibrance can take a long time, even 6 or more months to work, and it was true in my case. 2nd scan during it was better than the first with markers higher every time.

I have had this onc for 11 years and he well respected and it is not that I doubt that but maybe he is just getting too old? I agree with Caryn, you can't be rigid with this disease when there is no known cure! I'm sure there are many patients who just do everything advised and that is it. that is the kind of patient for him but not me. I wish I could do that but I can't. I have had a decent relationship with him even though I have probably been a minor nuisance from time to time. I figure oh well, he hhis job and mine wll be to find out all I can. no biggie. Until now where I feel like he is preventing me from what I need to do. I will not get on his bad side but go the next appointment and get my scrips. then I will see about switching. I don't think there is much of a risk or downside to trying this treatment. I think that worst than can happen is I will just get more mets soon after, which may or may not happen ether way. I just got a letter from ins that there are going to be nw quantity limits on effexor. I have been taking it for hot flashes fr 10 years. I mght not need it anymore but I think it is a slow taper to come off of it. I know when I occasionally miss one it's pretty unpleasant. Caryn it is awesome that your met is staying dead with no new ones! that is the kind of chance I wuld love. with 7 mets it is probably not likely but hey, you never know, and 4 of them have sayed drmant from the beginning o treatment.

I was afraid to take the bandages off and my mom and I stood in front of the mirror and took them off, worried about what we would see! We both had the same reaction and were like, wow, that doesn't look bad at all! So I guess what I'm saying is take your ativan and try not to worry, when its over things get better. I used to never even take a tylenol. Now my motto is just say yes to drugs! Its not healthy to have anxiety, physically or mentally, and the ativan really does work. Good luck to you with your surgery!",

I had others that were not active and he didn't count them. He's trying to go for cures when there's less than 10 Mets confined to one organ. His name is Paul Okunieff. I traveled from PA to get it and stayed at the hope lodge for free. It was 5 treatments, one per day for 5 days. I am dissatisfied with my oncologist too and he of course was against it but I did it anyway. The people at Shands are all unbelievably wonderful. The whole thing was very organized and non frustrating compared to what I'm used to. There is no income requirement for the lodge, you just get to stay and you can also have a caregiver stay with you. Unfortunately it was a short time before new bone Mets popped up, the ones that were treated are pretty much guaranteed to not come back, unlike regular rads that are mostly for pain reduction. The only problem I can think of is that one lesion might be a little bit too big, but I don't remember the exact cutoff. I have pic of doctor Okunieff in my cubicle. He is my hero for actually caring and being willing to try! For most of us we won't be cured, but there's always a few lucky ones. He cured a man of lung cancer who was completely given up on. Last time I saw his video he was 8 years from the treatment. If you search his name on YouTube there's a few videos.Â  Good luck at the 2nd opinion.

I don't have any risk factors for that so I figured most likely liver Mets. I started abraxane and after one treatment the ascites went away. Yay! Tm went from 2200+ to 139 in 4 cycles. This Monday I will start the 5th cycle. Well for about a week now I have been noticing the ascites returning. Today my lower legs were very swollen. The marker that was 139 was only 3 weeks ago. It seems unlikely for the chemo to stop working that abruptly. I'm sure it does happen but still. I'm starting to thing this isn't liver Mets but maybe heart failure. When I first got the ascites I was doing a lot of things to try to help it, like lemon/baking soda water, milk thistle and other supps, watermelon.....when they cleared up I stopped doing those things. I wonder if they really did help and the chemo was a coincidence. I don't know what to think now. Guess I will know more when I see doctor Monday and then see the tm friday. Lisbet, hang in there. It's very scary when things don't work. I agree with the others; there are lots of people I can remember that had a complete turn around. I just wish they would start you on something!

I've been reading a bit bc I am having liver issues which is really confusing and scaring me a bit. I've had bone Mets for 6+ years. I had a scan recently where it said \"worsenIng cirrhosis with small amt of ascite, extrhepatic and peritoneal\" and also shrunken and atrophic R kidney. oncologist said about the cirrosis he wouldn't put too much weight on it and there is change in the texture of the liver but he doubts cirrosis. Well after that was when I read the report and saw the ascites. I have wondered for 3 months now why I am gaining weight and it seems to all be in the belly. Went up a size in pants. And he did not even mention the bad kidney! Not sure exactly what atrophy means but it sounds to me like the kidney is shot. The last scan before that was liver normal, kidneys normal. Granted that was year ago. I'm feeling urgent to get on a treatment because I want these ascites removed, but scared that anything I take will hurt my liver even more. Has anyone had ant similar experience or any thoughts at all? Also about 3-4 months ago I had BP of 200/120. Craved dill pickles and the juice like crazy. Still do. It's down now with meds but I really don't know how long it was high like that. All I can say is less than a month. Maybe that episode really did some damage. I've been loading up on milk thistle, ALA, NAC. Ascites seem to at least not be getting any worse but I'm obsessed with looking at it. Thanks for reading the long post!

I said maybe you could look at it again. He said \"I didn't see anything\" . Lol ok bye. It just goes round and round with him! Whether it's cancer or cirrosis that is my main concern right now. His main concern is progression in bones which I've never had any symptoms from and seems like the usual for me.

I wonder if they could do surgery on a big tumor? Probably depends where it is in the liver.Â  Bubble, just want to add I found aut about the doctor and the treatment AT&T Shands by looking it up online. I didn't get referred, just called them myself. They require an MRI that my oncologist had to order and then I had to send it along with the other. Records but the hosp took care of that. And as usual my oncologist gave me hassle and wouldn't order the MRI. I told nucmed I will pay for it myself, but that was not allowed bc I had insurance. I got so mad I said to oncologist, I want to get this guy's opinion and if I can't get the MRI I will go to Tristan imaging and tell them I have no insurance and pay myself! Well I think opinion was the magic word and he finally agreed. He wouldn't want it to be said that he prevented someone from a 2nd opinion.Â  My parents have a trailer where they stay in the winter near Orlando at a park called Outdoor Resorts Orlando at the area called four corners. Are you familiar? It's about 2 hours from Shands. When I was at hope lodge I met a lady who actually lives there. My mom hangs out with her at the pool sometimes. I love that park and if I don't live to get some retirement and some of the $ that's been confiscated all my working life I am going to be one pisses off dead person!Â ",

And also a friend of mine had it happen. Had a scan that looked good and felt good, working FT, two weeks later felt dizzy, found brain Mets as well as lung, liver, lymph nodes, bile duct. It was shocking.Â  I was the same way, started on letrozole which was great, a tiny bit of joint pain but that was it. That worked for almost two years. After that, every treatment brought markers down drastically for 2 months, then up again, although I did stay on all of them at least a year. First he wants to see trends, not just one high marker. That takes months. Then when we see the trend we get a scan to confirm because \"we don't treat the marker\" . I sort of got used to this and sometimes I would be the one to say let's wait one more month. Of course I depend on him to tell me if it's dangerous. I think I should have a biopsy too of the liver because it apparently looks like cirrosis but he highly doubts it and doesn't seem convinced it's Mets either. He is more focused on getting the treatment started because of new bone areas. I am panic stricken about the liver and am totally focused on that. New bone Mets is nothing new to me. The problem is I'm driving myself crazy researching because if I don't know what's wrong I don't know what to do. Most likely cancer, which I'm starting chemo soon for, but what if it really is cirrosis? In that case I'm afraid of just about any treatment because I want to protect the liver! I think I need to stop thinking about it altogether and bring up the Christmas tree! Very frustrating.",

I still think it can be helpful in a lot of cases. Look at grannax! I had it for two bad spinal lesions and it did cure those, with very little possibility of coming back in those spots. My oncologist was against that but I did it anyway. Getting ins to pay for such things is even harder than convincing the doc to do it. We have to find out about things here, then find someone who does it and bug the heck out of them!

Fear of cancer, of eating the wrong foods, of being a disappointment, etc. Not sure how to live fearlessly once you already have the cancer! Anyway, take it for what its worth.

I want to have treatment that works BEFORE progression is found, rather than just wait for it! Maybe that's not realistic and doesn't make a difference, but I want to keep this confined if at all possible and sometimes I feel like since we can't be cured, the oncs just take their good old time about things figuring we are going to die anyway. I'm just not sure yet if that is my oncs thinking or not. We will see. He does do the ca27-29 for early stage even though its not recommended because he disagrees with the thinking that it won't prolong life.

I told him that I am feeling more threatened every day and the last time it was 2 months and I cannot wait that long in this state of mind. And I said I needed some Ativan.Â  Bubble that is ridiculous to wait 5 weeks simply for blood results! Glad you put your foot down.Â  I do think long and hard before complaining because I don't want him to unconsciously not treat me as well. But this takes the cake. Tennille thanks for that info about milk thistle, I did not know that. I am also taking NAC which turns into glutathione in the body. And alpha lipoic, all of which are supposed to help the liver. And just started doing baking soda/lemon water in the morning. I feel like I'm going to turn yellow any minute if I can get this cleared up and I don't even know what it is. My phone changed your name to Fenicle haha. Funthing you are right, I am listening to my instincts this time. I will hear from him tomorrow or find somewhere else to go. I sent the email late in the day so I will give it til tomorrow When we decide to switch treatment I stopped Xeloda but I'm going to start again tonight and pray it doesn't make the liver worse.Â  That y90 sounds harsh!

My nephew was 6 the first time I got cancer and I simply told him I had cancer the medicine would make it better but also will make me bald. So it wasn't a big deal to him and he would tease me. One time he had a friend over and she said \"why don't you have any hair?\" And just stared at me with big eyes. He said \"she has cancer\" just matter of factly. One time we were at my uncles for a family get together and they were having a sing a long. Well he got bored and started tormenting and suddenly he pulled my wig off and siad \"hey everyone! Heidi wears a wig! She's actually BALD!\" Omg I laughed so hard I was crying and everyone just got quiet and mortified! He was such a joy as a kid.Â  So the nurse coordinator was back at work today. She called and said she saw some orders in my chart and did anyone call me to schedule anything. I said no, apparently everything comes to a standstill when she's off work. So I have an ultrasound of the abdomen this Thursday. I also looked up the info of the liver specialist I want to see and have that ready just in case. I was actually going to call him for an appointment if I didn't get a call today. Feeling a lot better now. I get so mad when I don't get called back that even something minor will become the biggest problem in the world. I found this morning that the baking soda/lemon juice drink in the morning is a very good cleanse! I started it Sunday morning. I'm going to continue indefinitely unless I find out its bad for some reason.Â  I hope everyone is feeling good today. I am keeping y90 in the back of my mind. Just in case I ever need it.",

As its slowing down, the cancer cells not killed yet start dividing, so by getting a tx 2 weeks later instead of 3, you can get those cells quicker and they have less time to grow. So if you can tolerate it, dose dense is better. I was achey from the neulasta but nothing unbearable. Everyone is different but I wouldn't assume you will have a lot of pain. I do exhaustive research to the point of being ridiculous, and I remember being scared to death of Taxol based on what I read. When I finally had it it was a cakewalk compared to AC! Not that it was pleasant of course. When I had the first tx of AC and the se's kicked in, I said oh my god, how am I goingto one more let alone 3! But when I had the first taxol I said hey, this is doable!",

I had vomiting a few hrs after the first one, got zofran and was fine the rest of the week, but still had nausea after treatment that seems to get worse after the treatments. I'm still taking the zofran and I also had slight heartburn. Starting today I have an obvious feeling of a lump in my throat when swallowing. I plan to call tomorrow about it but have been putting it off thinking it will improve. I'm getting concerned that I made a mistake. I didn't expect this and I feel stupid for being so eager and grateful to get this tx and now feel almost abused. The abused feeling is another separate issue I guess, with me personally and my lack of confidence in cancer treatments, but whatever. I'm just wondering if anyone has experience at all similar to this. I've been doing searches and cannot find anything about how long this might last. This was supposed to be super precise with little to no damage to normal tissues and done by people who are considered some of the best at this tx. After the first episode the RO wanted to see me in his office and he seemed a little perplexed that I would have vomiting and said its not seen that often and when it is its in men the most and then younger women. Although I did read in the paperwork that with tads to the lower back you could get N/V, and the throat lump is probably from the T6. I'm just wondering why it is persisting and not improving after one week now. Thanks for reading and for any insight.

I have to say ever since I got a little pushy with my oncologist things have been much better. He even came down to the Infusion room to see me yesterday before chemo because I told the nurse I was feeling really poorly from it this past week. He ordered TSH and said it would be OK to skip this one if I wanted. I decided to get the treatment because I have next week off and my marker has gone down so much I don't want to mess it up.

How feasible is it to travel to the states if you found someone willing to it? I'm sure there's someone because Grannax had it and I'm pretty sure she's not the only one.

However, I have never noticed any other symptoms of menopause at all besides the hot flashes. No moodiness at all, and no physical symptoms that I'm aware of. So maybe its just that meno will not be that hard on you?

I had vomiting a few hrs after the first one, got zofran and was fine the rest of the week, but still had nausea after treatment that seems to get worse after the treatments. I'm still taking the zofran and I also had slight heartburn. Starting today I have an obvious feeling of a lump in my throat when swallowing. I plan to call tomorrow about it but have been putting it off thinking it will improve. I'm getting concerned that I made a mistake. I didn't expect this and I feel stupid for being so eager and grateful to get this tx and now feel almost abused. The abused feeling is another separate issue I guess, with me personally and my lack of confidence in cancer treatments, but whatever. I'm just wondering if anyone has experience at all similar to this. I've been doing searches and cannot find anything about how long this might last. This was supposed to be super precise with little to no damage to normal tissues and done by people who are considered some of the best at this tx. After the first episode the RO wanted to see me in his office and he seemed a little perplexed that I would have vomiting and said its not seen that often and when it is its in men the most and then younger women. Although I did read in the paperwork that with tads to the lower back you could get N/V, and the throat lump is probably from the T6. I'm just wondering why it is persisting and not improving after one week now. Thanks for reading and for any insight.

But seriously, I have read of many her2+ that are getting many years out of herceptin, like 15, 20 years and even more. Most of them on Facebook in Kelli Parkers large group of friends. I think it's gotten to the point where a lot of people wish they would turn her2+ so they could take herceptin and possibly be one of those exceptional responders. I am er/pr+ her2- and have Mets for 6 1/2 years. Still work ft and feel good except for being tired all the time. Mets are still only in bones, but recent PET showed a spot in shoulder muscle of all places. Not sure what to make of that. I have never been NED, most of the time scans are some areas better, some worse, some the same. We switch when the bad seems more than the good/same. Hope I can keep going this way but depends on that weird shoulder thing I guess. Eventually it gets a little easier not to worry.Â ",
