    "Content": "KERRICA wrote: My dear niece Whitney has  a large mass in her right breast... the past two months have caused her much pain. In her breast and abdomen, even under her arm. The US showed nothing, Mammogram was bypassed due to her age, and breast density.. she is just 18.  Her breast is 3x's the size of the other.. it is VERY noticeable.. she just got the call for the MRI results which also showed nothing.  Should we be worried? is it normal to not find a mass the MRI?  What if there is no blood supply to the mass..?  What else could this be?  Wacky hormones?  in infection? They told her she will have to have reconstructive surgery, when its all said and done regardless of what it is.  Should we be requesting an biopsy.. she was told they didnt want to disturb \"it\" until they had a name for \"it\" so no biposy at this point.  She will be seeing the doctor again tomorrow to check the breast and compare the size it was a few weeks ago until now. The whole family is holding its breath.. anyone have any info on MRI's that dont show anything, or any insight on what \"it\" could be? Log in to post a reply",
