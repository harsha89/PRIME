First treatment was enlightening since it was my first experience and went better than I expected. 2nd treatment really slammed me. So will I expect 3rd to be worse? My BP and pulse is running high. I have not vommited , but have been nauseous with no appetite. Bummer. I tried to clean bathroom today and it took me all day. This stuff really sucks. I am so blessed to have a supportive family and friends, but it is really nice to be able to get on here with people that really know how it is. Thanks and HELLO! ",
