Been taking these antibiotics for 4 days now and does'nt seem to have an effect on the pus coming out.

He already gave me a very strict and harsh chemo and rad/treatment regimen. I am actually thankful that he didnt give it to me.I would like to see what is going on first with the Cardiologist b/f continuing Herceptin.I also cant believe they didnt discuss this with you. I would go ahead and ask to for a referral to a Cardiologist. Good luck to you Kathy",
