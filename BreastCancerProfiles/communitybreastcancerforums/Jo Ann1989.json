Then it slowly got better. For 24 years I have been thankful for every day I have. You don't forget it just gets easier to live. Right now I'm having testing done don't know yet when I will have the biopsy but now I just try and remember that I have had 24 year and they have been a blessing and a gift. I have watched my daughter grow up and I have a 14 yr old granddaughter grow and now have a new little 8 month old granddaughter. For us on the good things. Joann",
