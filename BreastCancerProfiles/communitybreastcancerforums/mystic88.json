What kind of biopsy are you having? I would imagine it will be ultrasound guided as it visible with this modality. The procedure is pretty straight forward, the dr will give you a local anesthetic and then proceed with the biopsy. It really should not be too painful (more like a little burning followed by pressure) but you can develop some gnarly bruising afterwards. Hope everything goes well, and keep us posted!",

That being said, it is always a good idea to get these checked out, especially with history of having a breast lump.

I tried getting a hold of my surgeon for about a week without getting as much as a call back from anyone in the office. The receptionist told me there was nothing she could do and that I would have to wait until next week to get any information back- so I took it upon myself to call the imaging facility directly (5 times to be exact) and got the MRI report back after everyone was tired of talking to me. Pays to be persistent! So anyway I called my gyno and requested a referral to another surgeon. If she doesn't have time to discuss results with me, I don't feel comfortable with her cutting me. So I have an appointment with the new surgeon on Monday, as well as a brain MRI as my prolactin levels are pretty elevated and they now want to assess my pituitary. Hope you are all doing well!",

My aunt who was diagnosed with DCIS just had sx and radiation, and she is doing well 5 years later. I asked my dr about this and everyone says to just wait after the MRI next week before we make any more decisions. It sucks not having concrete answers to all our questions ans concerns. What I would say, is listen to your dr's advice. I am glad you found a good dr that is compassionate and takes the time to listen to you. If they think tamox is the best option to decrease the chance of further atypical growths, I would go for it. That being said, these are all very personal decisions. I feel like the diagnosis of ADH just leaves us in the limbo where we are not normal yet we are not critical enough to be addressed with urgency. It's like the worst of both worlds.

A little background- I am 29 and was diagnosed with ADH earlier this week. I felt a lump on my right breast a year ago, GP told me to watch it as \"scary things\" in females my age are \"almost non-existent\". And so I did. Over the last 3 months however, I felt the mass triple in size. I went to a new gynecologist who scheduled me for an ultrasound and immediately got me in for core biopsies. A few days later I get called in to review the results in person and sure enough, ADH, high risk. I do have family history and I am currently waiting on genetic test results as well as getting a consult scheduled with an onco surgeon. Even though I know this is not truly cancer, I am pretty terrified. Based on what my gyno said, it seems that I have a much higher probability of developing true BC given my age and degree of tissue changes. And now I have a new mass on my other breast too. I try to be strong, to focus on work, and to take it one day at a time. My husband keeps telling me to stay calm and that everything will be ok, and I just want to scream that no, everything is NOT ok and that this sucks!!

Don't worry too much about the suture though- they are meant to be absorbed/dissolved by the body but depending on which type they used, it can take up to a month. If it is painful and inflamed definitely have them remove it. They more often cause a localized swelling (called suture reaction) versus true infection. I'm sure your children understand- and if not now, they will in the future. It's important for you to focus on yourself through all of this. After all, if you don't take proper care of yourself, you won't be able to care well for them either. Take it one step at a time! These are some of the questions I asked my BC/onco- - Do you recommend lumpectomy or mastectomy? Do I have the option of opting for a prophylactic mastectomy? - Given my age (29) how much risk do I have life long of developing true BC? - Given the histopathology ambiguity of my biopsy sample (they were unable to \"definitively exclude carcinoma\") and aggressive look of my tumor on ultrasound (highly vascular and very irregular) what are the chances of being upgraded to a higher malignancy? - After finding a lump on my other breast (which ultrasound showed as a dilated duct and thickened glandular tissue)- how often do you see changes in the contralateral side once diagnosed with atypical changes? - Is there a reconstructive surgeon you recommend? - Should my younger sister be tested/screened? What age? (important if you have daughters!) - How often should I be monitored after surgery?  These are just what I came up with. As wonderwoman said, if you are able to take someone with you to the appointment it will help have another perspective on what the doc is saying and recommending. If your husband is not quite ready to go with you, have a good friend accompany you. Taking notes is a very good idea as well- you don't need to jot down word for word, but a general idea of what they are recommending. Lastly, you can always request a copy of your appointment record so you have it in front of you and can read everything your doc discussed. My doc's office has an online patient portal so you can access everything at any time. It helps me to read things over and over and know exactly what the plan is and what the next steps will be. I am getting my MRI done on Friday so we can plan for surgery probably late this month or early next month. If you need anything don't hesitate to send a private message!",

She did a very thorough exam, took a long time sitting down with me and discussing all aspects of care, and was very empathetic. I feel so comfortable with her and her entire team. Since we last corresponded I developed really acute pain on my breast- just like you are describing. It comes and goes along with clear nipple discharge. My brain MRI actually showed I do have a pituitary mass, 0.4mm. In the light of high prolactin they are calling it a prolactinoma, so now in addition to needting breast MRIs every year I need a brain MRI every 2 years. I will probably have to start on medications for this at some point, but I need to figure out my breast surgery first. These are almost always benign anyway. I'm sorry you had such a confusing consult! It's super frustrating when drs can't agree on a diagnosis. I think the difference between ADH and atypical cells in addition to hyperplasia is that atypical cells are present in addition to normal excessive cells, but that there is no abundance of atypical cells. Which I think it redundant.. and not sure how much of a difference it makes. It sucks you were kicked out of that FB page. It's not like we are looking to be in this situation, and just reaching out to others who are in similar situations is very very helpful. Anyway, my lumpectomy is finally scheduled for the 8th! I can't wait to get this done and move on with life. Keep in touch!",

In terms of how bid DCIS has to be for it to be picked up by MRI, I don't think there is a \"one size fits all\" answer. I think there is a lot of variability, but the final biopsy results will give you the definitive answer. Do you have s surgery date yet? Good luck!",

When my gyn palpated the mass, she was pretty convinced it was just a plugged milk duct but ordered the ultrasound for my peace of mind. My mass turned out to be atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and genetic testing did not show any mutations. Have you had genetic tests? When is your US scheduled for? Do expect there to be a lot of waiting in between tests, results, and follow ups. As a lot of the ladies here can confirm, the waiting can drive you a little bit crazy! Make sure to keep yourself occupied :) Hoping for benign results for you! If you have any more specific questions about my experience feel free to PM me.",
