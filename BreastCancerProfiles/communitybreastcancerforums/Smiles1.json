I thinkÂ  regret getting expanders and going for reconstruction. I have never had any tolerance to pain and no one tells how difficult this really is. I cry each day and I am not really sure why. My PS said that I can get expanders out and no reconstruction but could have a lot for extra skin/ scar tissue. I am wondering has anyone else changed their mind ? had expanders out & not gone through reconstruction ? Are my feelings normal ?",
