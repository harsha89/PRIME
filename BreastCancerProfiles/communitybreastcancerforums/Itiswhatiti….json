My experience with chemo is that even my leftover oxy from surgery barely touched the bone/joint/muscle pain I have with my treatments.

Is skin type vs SEs... I'm a fair skinned auburn hair (well, before I lost it with chemo).. Has anyone asked or noticed a trend in worse side effects for fair skinned? Or does it really not matter? I met with my RO before starting chemo. Don't ask me why they scheduled it way back then...I've been a little distracted with the torture of chemo so I have forgotten everything she told me. what are the boosts you bare talking about & does everyone get them?
