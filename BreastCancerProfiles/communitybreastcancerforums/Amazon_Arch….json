Cramming a whole bunch of stuff in before Monday morning. Lets see...Mom wants to go grocery shopping for the whole family get together that are coming tomorrow, have to pick hubby up from dialysis, have a b-day party to go to for my uncle in the early evening tonight. Try to get some cooking done tonight for tomorrow if at all possible, if not...up early in the morning...btw did i mention that the surgery was actually suppose to be done on June 24th but they called and postponed it 4 days before hand. Oh and I got a puppy :) she is a chocolate lab and I named her Cocoa. She positively adores me and sticks to my side like glue :) and I didn't even have to house break her...she just went straight to the door and whined...I've had her a week and no accidents so far. I wonder if I can sneak her into the hospital and hide her under my bed Monday? (just joking).Â  Thank you for the good wishes and I will post as soon as I can after Monday",

This is my second go around. My first time was 17 years ago and let me tell you of my initial experience. The first time I was diagonoised they removed my drains the same time they removed the staples, 10 days post-op. Within 48 hours I was vomiting every 15 minutes and had constant hiccups 24/7. I was rehospitalizied and spent the next 24 days in the hospital. Apparently they took the drains out to soon and the fluid build up was to much for my body to absorb. I went from 140 pounds down to 92 pounds. Once the fluid finally got to a point where my body could acutally absorb it I was fine. So this time around, I don't care how long the drain has to stay in, it's staying until i'm down to 30 cc or less in 24 hours. It is a nuisance, an irritant and just a royal pain in the tush, but I never want to have to go through again what I did the first time by pulling the drains to soon. Hang in there, it will slow down to the point where they can remove them safely without any ill effects for you.",

I'm only 3 weeks post op and I got an infection at my surgery sight, so no shaving or deodorant until the infection clears and the open wound closes. What happened was 2 pieces of surgical tape came off in the shower and when it did the skin came with it and left 2 open wounds that got infected, so the healing is taking longer then normal. My dear mother is actually the one that suggested I try the aloe vera and like I stated earlier I'm surprised how well it's working.",

Then when I did shave, I did it very carefully and as gently as I could and I tried not to come even close to my incision areas. (My incision goes all the way around under my arm). Hope this helps.
