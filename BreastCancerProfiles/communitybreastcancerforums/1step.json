It took awhile to get everything lined up, but I did my 15 days of intense therapy during the last of my chemo and finished before I started rads. I managed to keep myself from swelling to the point of needing to repeat the intense therapy throughout rads. I did really well this week, until yesterday, getting in my MLD and LE PT exercises twice each day. Tuesday and Thursday, I made it to my self-defense classes (an hour of cardio with techniques taken from any/all martial arts taught with the focus in self-defense), and I'm working on push-ups and horizontal pulls and a 30 day squat challenge. I'm not sure if my PT exercises are Lebed or not, but I plan on checking that out. Thanks for the inspiration!",
