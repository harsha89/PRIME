It's not too bad but it is pronounced for a couple hours after the rad treatment and then fades until the next day. I am also on tamoxifen and have been taking it at night, about 7 hours after radiation. the nausea corresponds more directly to the radiation but I bet being on tamoxifen doesn't help my body deal with the nausea better.",

My scalp is currently comfy without the scarf and I'm thinking the Scalipicin will help with my tendency to ingrown hairs and such.",

It's almost as bad as my husky mutt shedding her winter coat!

If that's not helping, there are other products that have more salicylic acid in them or lactic acid (in 12% concentrations like AmLactin) that can help loosen up surface cells that might be blocking follicles or pores. If you go up in concentration or try the amlactin, always be careful to test a little (1 sq cm)Â  patch somewhere and wait a day or two so you don't irritate your whole scalp. and as jpmom says, seeing a dermatologist could be good as s/he could prescribe something most appropriate for you and your skin. (I already have my dermatology appt scheduled for next January, should be post-radiation and all. I expect I will need some help.) auntienance, now that you mention it, I too have a good dent on the top right side of my head and some ridges in the back. It will be fine if I looked like a Star Trek alien or something but if it's just weird, I may not be so enthusiastic about the dome look. we shall see...",

I hope the BGC went ok today and you're not feelin to crummy. jpmom, I've started using eyeliner again and won't go without colored lip gloss. I don't use foundation, rarely powder but I definitely feel the need to accentuate other features and be \"girly\" too. I hope you sleep well tonight.

I have had that off and on too, especially when it was first falling out. There have been a few other times when I've had the same feeling but not quite as strong as 14 days after my first AC. I switched to using the same cleanser and lotion on my scalp that I use on my face. It has a little peppermint in it so it's kind of soothing but it also doesn't dry it too much which seemed to be part of my problem. I use Dr. Woods facial cleanser (not Dr. Bronner's, Dr. Woods) and California Baby Sensitive Everyday lotion. The cleanser and lotion combo also seems to help prevent peeling which I was getting a bit of on my scalp - nothing too intense but definitely some skin cells were coming off.",
