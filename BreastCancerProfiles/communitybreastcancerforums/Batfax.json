She got on an A/A + ribociclib trial in August, but this week we found that in addition to some progression in the liver (less than 20% though, so she was clear for the trial) she had a new brain met, so the trial was donezo. After this and Ibrance/Letrozole failed in very short order, I've started to wonder whether her ER+ is somehow hormone therapy resistant. Hopeful Xeloda will work as Taxol did for 9 months.",

She's been on Taxol since September and has kept the bulk of her hair. It's certainly thinned, but she has decided that the expense and inconvenience is worth it. We also used them during her initial diagnosis through her AC/T treatment and it was similarly successful. I've never heard anyone suggest there is any contraindication and the cancer center we currently visit has a freezer to enable their use and will likely start rolling out the DigniCap (a more convenient contraption) before long.",

My wife's in for a brain MRI and CT scan after experiencing persistent abdominal issues--constipation, abdominal fullness/total lack of appetite, significant heartburn. After seeing that her tumor markers have continued to rise after her first cycle of A/A plus ribociclib (a trial), he MO decided to move them up a few weeks. We're not really that worried about the brain MRI since she has had really good results from SRS on a single .5cm lesion back in Dec. '15. The concern is the abdomen as her liver lesions have been progressing since May--Taxol started to fail and then Ibrance promptly failed in August. She also developed a new pancreatic lesion as of August and new lymph nodes. Plus, she appeared to have a small amount of free fluid on the pelvis in August and I'm concerned this is the beginning of ascites. The only reassuring thing is that her liver function continues to be fine per he blood work. Hopefully they won't keep us waiting too long before delivering the results.",

One of her liver tumors decreased, but three increased, albeit less than 20%, so she didn't get booted from the trial. However, we found out today that she's got a new brain lesion (still small at 4 mm) that wasn't there at the end of June, so now she's off the trial and starting Xeloda this week. We're meeting with the MO this week and will hopefully have something scheduled with the RO soon. Hoping we can just SRS this one like the last one.",
