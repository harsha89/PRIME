It was so clear to me when I picked Dr Kimberly Blackwell due to some excellent references. I met her and was very happy I had her to work with my oncologist here in Wilmington. Now I am real uneasy about who to choose at Duke and I can't get in touch with Dr Blackwell. Does anyone know anything about the oncologists at Duke Dx 10/2017, Right, 1cm, Stage IV, metastasized to bone, 1/18 nodes, ER+, HER2+ Hormonal Therapy Femara (letrozole) Log in to post a reply",
