I am 42, I found out I had invasive breast cancer in January. In November it was non-invasive but the mastectomy showed different. At any rate, you have every reason to be scared, I have never been so scared in my life. Every time I turned around I kept getting bad news. I cried everyday, in the shower, in the car, etc. everyone here will help you get through this, though. The BC veterans that pop up here are so helpful, I am willing to help in any way I can. I start chemo either next week or the week after, I am so nervous about the unknown. Hang in there....keep us posted. ",

I agree with above posts that you NEED to get all the information possible and make the right decision for yourself. I did what I did for peace of mind, taking a risk but because I already had a cancer mets to my lymph node I HAD to know how much mets we are dealing with. Best of luck, I've said before this decision was, by far, THE hardest decision to make when I found out the risks involved. ",

My mammo was read negative, then I looked at it and asked for magnification views (I'm a mammo tech). I was told it'll be fine. The day after my biopsy i was told I have DCIS. Had a lumpectomy and the radiation oncologist gave me results (he just happen to be the one to access them first) of clear margins. My surgeon and I asked each other why the specimen radiograph showed calcifications that were not mentioned in the pathology so he asked for the slides to be looked at again. This came back as multi-focal DCIS! A MRI then showed 3 suspicious areas, now I needed a mastectomy!  Had a SNB as a precaution and had 1 positive lymph node with macromets. Sigh, it was just more bad news one right after the other. I thought I was gonna die but this week I will be halfway through 18 chemo treatments.  I got out of the radiation but will need more surgery for recon. I'll be thinking positive thoughts for you and all the lovely people here. HANG IN THERE!",

You mention bilateral, is your other breast affected at all? My surgeon left that decision to me but felt I made a good decision to just go with having only affected breast taken off. That really is a person to person thing, I feel, the bilateral vs. unilateral. The decision between lumpectomy and mastectomy I asked my surgeon to honestly tell me what he would do if it was his daughter, wife, etc. as a side note, the radiation oncologist was not very receptive to treat me with a second lumpectomy knowing the MRI had showed multiple suspicious areas. That was another reason I went for a mastectomy. ",

I have to assume any rampant cells that may have slipped through my one node are being killed by my chemo. That's a good question, if you have cancer cells in your nodes and chemo kills them will pathology know that? I believe in the SNB, honestly, if you have negative sentinel nodes then you're probably safe from more node removal. ",
