      "Content": "ByGODsGrace wrote: I'm needing some information in regards to women with large breast that are fibrotic and somewhat dense. BRIEF HISTORY: When I was 28 I had a partial hysterectomy and my appendix removed at the same time  after a tubligation when I was 23. At 33 I had the gallbladder removed. A few years ago I had a mamm. and US done. The specialist said the lump I felt on the right wasn't a concern to him as much as the on the left that my GP found. He said it was the direction and position, though he wasn't highly concerned and re-schedule another US in a year. I didn't get to make that appointment due to coming down with Mutliple zoned shingles (basically my whole spine got it). While they were determining the shingles they had done a MRI that found my kidney cancer (rare type but slow growing and at the age of 37). I had that removed in Oct. 2005. Since the shingles I got the post shingles that has lasted up till now, though it has subsided alot in the last 6 months. A year after the kidney cancer was removed (they took the whole kidney). I ended up with 4\"X3\" incisional hernia that they meshed back together. I got let go of my job a little of a year ago because of all of the sickness, they just chose to use another excuse. I moved to South Carolina by my parents and started working again. BC runs in the family, though typically in their 70's +. We also carry lung cancer and my kidney cancer. Sorry not to sure how BRIEF that actually was. Recently I have for some reason decided to do self examinations, which I should have atleast done prior. I felt an irregular small form in the R-breast. The lump in the L-breast is hard to tell if it has increased in size or not. I have also felt what I think are 2 lymph nodes about the size of peas at the top of my chest below the collar bone and 2 more down a bit further, then going towards the armpit is a couple. This is the L-breast side the dr. was a bit concerned of. There a only a couple on the R-breast side that are smaller. As you go down along the side of the L-breast almost at 9 o'clock there are a couple of enlarged ones about the size of my first finger pad and these are extremely painful when finger pressure is applied. These on the R-breast at 3 o'clock are only the size of peas. What I'm wanting to know is if these lymph nodes are not swollen would you still feel them? Especially in larger breast. I'm about a 36-38 E. I've never paid any attention to examining these areas before, so I couldn't tell if there is any changes. Bare in mind I have find someone to give me a free mammo. due to my Cobra expiring and the cost of individual insurance is outrageous when you already have pre-existing cancer and haven't passed the 5 yr. survivor cliché. I'm having to track down my previous mammo. and US before I make an appt. though. I would appreciate your thoughts and words. GOD Bless Log in to post a reply",

Sometimes it's still hard to decipher the medical lango even on the internet. If this is true that it's not the same a lymph node then I have now 2 nodules in my breast. :( I have finally manage to tell the difference in my lymph nodes as far as the soft rubber ones versus the hard firm ones. Makes a difference, especially when you have large lumpy breast to begin with. I was starting to panic because I could feel several in different areas of soft rubber ones, but the hard firm lymph nodes I have only found 3 and their all close to the area of the nodule the doctor recently found. This is becoming really scary. If I do get dx, the treatments are rough enough on the body. My concern is the kidneys are what expells the chemo/radiation for the most part and I only have one left that has a 1.5-2 cm cyst in the middle. I have no idea what perdictament this will put this kidney in.  I sure do need to find something else to think about. Thanks again and GOD Bless",

      "Content": "ByGODsGrace wrote: Hi Everyone, I recently noticed an unusual shape to the side of the center of my right breast, almost towards the bottom of the breast. It's not a lump of any sorts. The best way I can describe it, is it feels like a jagged, solid  splinter sticking out. It's not on a lobe, more running with the ducts. I've done alot of web searching recently and am not finding alot for this type of shape in a breast. (It's only on one breast). I had kidney cancer that they caught early in 2005 and successfully removed my right kidney. My family has major history of breast cancer, though typically not until your 70's and older. My cobra insurance has run out and even though my employer supplies me with a small re-imbursment for insurance monthly, I can not get insurance on my own because of pre-existing cancer. I have noticed that the niple has half way retracted and itching at the nipple, though I'm trying to keep these symptoms out of my head for now. I have put in calls to try and find an in-expensive or no cost mammogram to have this looked at. In the mean time, does anyone have any information or links where I can read upon a shape similiar to what I am trying to describe? I appreciate everyone's thoughts on this.

We tend to come on here asking questions that we pretty much know the answer or atleast know what we have to do when things like this pop up. But having words from someone else's brain is re-assurance, and that I am thankful for. I put in a call to a couple of places to find a low or no cost mammogram. My last one was done some time around the kidney cancer surgery. They weren't concern with the lump I showed them at that time and I'm really not sure if I can find it now. They did ultrasound on the left one that they found and was concerned about. They re-scheduled me a year later, but I didn't get to make that one with being so sick and dealing with the kidney. The only thing I'm finding which is concerning me at all is information about cancer that breaks through the duct walls. Classified as \"jagged\", which could or could not be the case. It's all in GOD's hands either way, and even though I do like to do research for knowledge...........just in case. Thanks for your time. GOD Bless",

I was amazed to find out it has been 4 yrs this coming Oct. and the day after I was baptized when I had them done. As I stated before back then the doctor was a bit concerned but wanted to watch the lump he found in my left breast because of the shape and direction. I could verly feel it when he pointed out physically but you could see it on the ultrasound. Last year I lost a dear friend to the battle of BC of 2.5yrs. Recently my boss's ex-wife was diagnosed with stage 3 BC, so I started researching more in case I could be of help and support to her when I came upon this place; which is also, what got me to start up my self-exams again. During my exams I've noticed that the left side lymph nodes are noticeable about 4 o'clock, some at 3 o'clock, then as you work your way up there's a few more between the collar bone and armpit. So I decided that I probably shouldn't blow this off and be on the safe side to get them checked out. I don't have insurance, my cobra expired recently and my employer doesn't carry it. I did find a place that would help on a sliding scale, which is better then nothing and will be going in today. The mobile mammogram unit said they only did a screening mammograms and I needed a diagnostic mammogram. Anyway, I decided out of the blue to start checking other lymph areas and there isn't any on my R-breast area or the groin area. This is what has gotten me REALLY WORRIED is I decided for some reason to continue checking up my neck area and well.......rubbing around on it started feeling good....lol. So I began rubbing the back sides of my neck and on the right side between the back neck tendants and the main side tendants ( i read the area is called \"posterior triangle) is a mass that almost feels a little smaller then 2\". I've never noticed this especially since my hair goes down to my lower back. There is no pain and it does not move at all. It raised slightly through the skin but feeling around it, it feels kinda deep. I am so worried that if this is BC then there's a good chance that it has already spread. I can't imagine it being a re-occurance of the kidney cancer because it was slow growing and rare, not to mention if it spreads then it goes to the liver and lungs. With out insurance, no husband(or other financial support) and a daughter who will be a senior next year and is starting college at the same time I have no idea how I will manage all of it. From what I have read here you all are a great encourament and I could use some of that. Also, if some one has simaliarities I would appreciate your testimony.

I do recall that the doctor said she did feel nodule at 3 o'clock. What is the difference between a node and nodule? .....or does it mean the same thing? I spoke with my mother about the visit and as much as we tend to be completely different we are alike just the same. She has had califications (spelling?) and a small lump biopsied before that was benign. She told me, as so many here have said, try not to worry because it will only bring your system down and make you feel worse. That if it does end up being BC then we will pray and take it one step at a time. It's taken her years to be able to show compassion and she really was comforting this time. Anyway, just curious if any one could shead some light on the differences of node and nodule. Thanks and GOD Bless",

I didn't have chemo/rad because it was rare and didn't affect that type. The friend who had breast cancer and chemo/rad. found different hats that had hair sown into the edges as well as several wigs. The biggest hurdle I found was being sick and still trying to perform my duties. There were times I was curled in a ball under my desk with the door shut just to try and regain my composure for the day. It's a tough situation either way dealing with the sickness of it and still trying to be professional. People understand and bosses do to but to the point of it affecting your work performance and it's bad enough that you feel ill and bad when you can't always perform the way you use to. I'm sure it's different for the most part at each office/job. It's still tough. I wish you the best with your journey on this and comfort and peace. GOD BLESS",

The doctor was very nice and listened, although when she was feeling around for the nodes she was going so fast, I thought how could you possibly tell anything unless it jumped out and bit you. She did, however asked a few times for me to point out where I felt them again and then she said she felt them, lol of course since she slowed down. Afterwards, she said well.....you do know you will have to get a mammogram and US. :) She checked to see if there was any more funding in any grants and told me that the University would work with me on payment. This is the one thing that sucks, I have always had insurance up until a couple of months ago and they always covered my mammograms, US, MRI and CATScans....uuugh. I obviously need another job. So....they are scheduling in a week long enough for me to get my previous mammo and US in. Yes, this is scary. I think the unknown always is. Not to mention, if by chance it is, I have alot of things I would like to get in order that I wouldn't be able to physically or mentally down the road. Well.......it's the waiting game time...so throw me in the pot with everyone else and we'll have a party until then. Thanks again for your kind and sincere words, they have made me feel better.
