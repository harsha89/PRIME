    "Content": "Ohiogirl49 wrote: I was diagnosed and had my mastectomy in March, then began chemo in April. After my vicious third treatment I developed a lingering nauseous feeling in my throat. It hasn't gone away yet and I finished my chemo - six rounds of TAC - seven weeks ago. My oncologist hasn't got a clue. She thought that I had acid reflux, so I took protonix until last week - it didn't really help. Has anyone else experienced this feeling?  I am so tired of this constant lump in my throat!  It only goes away when I eat - makes me want to keep shoving food down my throat!  Please help!  I don't want to feel sick anymore!
