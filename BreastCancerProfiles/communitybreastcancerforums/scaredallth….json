Since then I have been terrified of all things cancer. Yet, I've learned that it is so important to learn and fight for your body! We are worth it! I don't care how many doctors I annoy! LOL Having a place like this to be able to connect with other women with knowledge, experience and fears the same as mine is wonderful! Thank you",

I am also a single mom of two children and I suffer from extreme anxiety. Especially regarding my health. I am freaking out right now thinking I have IBC due to a red spot I found on my breast. The best thing I can say is focus on what is positive and LOGICAL. Anxiety tends to make our worst case scenarios the forefront of our minds and it is easy to lose perspective on reality. Yes, breast cancer is scary! But very treatable in many, many cases! Try to take comfort in the idea that even IF (which is still a big IF) this is cancer...that is not a death sentence. Those are the things I have to repeat to myself literally hundreds of times a day just to stay calm. I know how overwhelming these fears can be. I really hope you find out reassuring news. Don't be afraid to bug the heck out the doctors with questions. That is their job. Ask everything you need until you feel confident! :)",
