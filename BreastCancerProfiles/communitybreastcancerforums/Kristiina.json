I am the type who can talk pro's and con's on and on. Despite the fact that one of my friends with the BRCA gene who had prophylactic mastectomy had recommended I have the mastectomy right away, I elected to have a lumpectomy., a much lesser operation. The chances of unclear margins was pretty small however, I went on to have 2 lumpectomies with unclear margins before finally going for the full mastectomy last February. I know I made the right decision at the time, with the information I was considering, having the lumpectomies, it was a much much easier operation. A mastectomy is a pretty big deal. Looking back at it, I am very glad to have avoided radiation by have a mastectomy. Another thing to think about, alternative medicine people are very nervous about cutting cancer cells and allowing them to travel through the body during an incomplete lumpectomy. Maybe a MX right away could make sense but I think it was hard for me to choose such a radical operation straight away. I did have reconstruction last September, I have a full mirror in my bathroom and did not want to be reminded every day of my loss. I am relatively happy with my new breast. It actually has a nicer shape that my natural aging breast. On that side I could get away without wearing a bra. I will eventually get a nipple tattoo. I had been to a topless beach in the Caribbean only once about 3 years ago. i am so glad I did it because i do not think I would be comfortable going again the way I am now. People talk about getting a tummy tuck at the same time as/or a few months after the reconstruction (fat grafting) but i thought it was too much surgery after having 3 breast surgeries already and oddly enough my appendix out.",
