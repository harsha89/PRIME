I don't want to scare you, but mine was a nightmare. Don't try to brave it. It might be a piece of cake, and if so, no harm done. You might talk to the radiology center and ask them to pre-medicate you. Many of them have protocols in place, but don't routinely let you know up front. Read about people's experiences with biopsy. What you might not know (sorry if you already know)--they put you on a very uncomfortable table with your head turned sharply to the side, and your breast hanging down in a hole through the table. The mammogram is under the table, and they raise you up and work under you like they're changing oil in a car. The dignity part was hard for me to take (which I didn't expect at all!). You have to stay still in that very uncomfortable position for at least an hour. Then, they actually shoot the needle into your breast with this gun, and it makes a noise and is really weird. All in all, I'll never do it again without premedication, and I've never taken a valium, xanax, ativan, or anything in my life. I would also like to comment on the advice to make sure they give you enough pain medication--and I completely agree! However, because of the very small size of the lesion they could see on MRI (their \"target\" as it were), they had to use minimal pain meds on me so they could be accurate in their biopsy collection, so they can't always adequately treat the pain. Again, if I'm ever faced with a similar situation, I'm going to insist on a surgical biopsy with conscious sedation. I'll never again let them do it the way they did.",

Vacuum stereotactic biopsy left breast resulting in a huge black and swollen breast. They never told me to bring someone to the biopsy, and I drove home and fainted twice while driving. By the time I got home, my breast was the size of a personal watermelon, and I was still passing out from the pain. Went to the ER and saw a tomato-sized hematoma by ultrasound. Now, it's 2.5 weeks later, and the breast is still huge. Still taking pain meds. We've had to postpone the MRI (Oh! BTW! The biopsy was positive for ILC!! Yay!!) because of the breast trauma which means we have to postpone the lumpectomy, etc. A couple of things: 1. This breast biopsy procedure is barbaric! I mean having them work underneath you like they're changing your oil?!?! Also, not warning you that you might need someone to drive you home? Not providing some sort of premedication, even though they shoot a needle into your boob? It's incredibly anxiety provoking, humiliating, degrading, and just sort of rapey. I mean, I get why they have to do it the way they do it, but why not premedicate? Also, that table! I'm fairly flexible without any joint issues, but it was torture to hold my head in that position for 1.5 hours! No man would ever allow his penis to hang down and get shot while he was still awake, and yet all the women just say \"women are strong\" \"glad they were able to find the cancer\" etc. We should be demanding better treatment. 2. Maybe that's why so many women who are eligible for lumpectomy get BMX. I've seen many say they will never go through this again. Can we start something here? Please? 3. It should be done as an outpatient surgery with post-op recovery. And, BTW--my biopsy was done by a specialized breast radiologist with great bedside manner and credentials. It wasn't a bad doctor, it's a bad system.",

I'm not sure yet, but I believe I'll be in a position to decide between mastectomy and lumpectomy with radiation. My instincts tell me mastectomy, but all the data shows that it's really no better than lumpectomy + rads. When I read the radiation side effects, they sound worse than the mastectomy ones! Is there no win/win with BC??",
