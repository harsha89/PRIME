    "Content": "Sep 16, 2010 07:41PM - edited Sep 16, 2010 07:42PM by elenalb I just had outpatient surgery on Tuesday to \"insert\" the Power Port.  This d*** thing is as painful as my bilateral mastectomy was in July.  It's on my left side (the cancer was in my right breast/lymph nodes) and is pulling on the mastecomy scar, which I'm still taking Vicodin for.  No one told me it would be this painful.  The surgeon (different one than did my mastectomy) mentioned some \"discomfort\", which I can deal with, but the pain on this surgery is a 6 or 7 on their pain scale.  I've blown through 1/2 of a 30 day Vicodin prescription in two days.  I can't imagine having anyone \"insert\" a needle in this port for months!! Sorry to blow off steam here, but it sounds like I'm not alone in thinking that getting a port was a bad idea.  I have 9 more weeks of weekly Taxol/Herceptin infusions (one this afternoon and each week thereafter) and then 9 months of weekly Herceptin infusions.  I hope my veins hold out another month or so until my chest isn't so sore.  Thanks for posting your \"port experiences\" and listening. elenalb",
