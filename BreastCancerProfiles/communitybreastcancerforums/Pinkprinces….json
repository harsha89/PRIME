Got my nails and toes done today. I want lashes and brows sooooo badly. I am happy with the hair growth I have being only 2 weeks post chemo. Mine began growing on the Taxol so I have complete coverage just not much length. I will post pics this week. I am having surgery on Wednesday so I will try to do it before then. I have started my reconstruction journey in the pic forum in the well burnt section since I will be having rads. Carrol you did get a date?",
