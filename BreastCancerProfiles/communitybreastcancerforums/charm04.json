It supposedly acts like the drug Tamoxifin without any of the side effects. It causes breast cancer cells to self-destruct and prevents them from forming in the first place. Please drink 4-5 cups a day. Or just drink the matcha green tea as it is stronger than regular green tea. Again, I strongly recommend researching this. I have kept my ADH from turning into cancer for years with my regimen of green tea, flaxseed oil, vitamin D, lots of exercise, fibre and very recently, the DIM formula from Nature's Way. Also,don't do mamograms - do thermograms instead and MRIs.",

My advice to you is to have only MRIs and thermograms (you can look up more information on thermograms on Dr. Mercola's website). They are very safe and accurate and have no radiation. Please read about he dangers of mamograms - they are very scary and have 1000 times more radiation than chest x-rays. I also take certain things to prevent breast cancer - Over 1000 mg of vitamin D (calcalciferol), a tablespoon of organic flaxseed oil, more effective when mixed with a little cottage cheese, a complex called DIM by Nature's Way (you can get it cheap online at theVitamin Shoppe or get it in their store at the online price. I also eat a lot of almonds daily and exercise regularly. Try to minimize sugar as much as you can. Also take a good amount of omega-3 fats with high levels of EPA and DHA.",
