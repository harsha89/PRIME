I have another appointment with him (taking DH) tomorrow after my pre-op appts.  I think I took most of it in the first time, and now I want him to explain it for DH.  And I have a number of questions for him (now that my head has stopped spinning).   Anyone have questions that they wished they had asked before hand? Or think important that I ask? I'm battling a sore throat and praying it doesn't go to my chest (history of bronchitis). I even went to Emergency on the weekend and got prophylactic antibiotics.  No way I want this delayed!!!!!  Send me good vibes please!  Log in to post a reply",

Every test and delay (summer OR closures, vacations, ct and bone scans - 9 weeks from diagnosis to surgery BMX and expanders. The the thing is, 24 yrs ago I had lumpectomy, rads, chemo. Raised my kids and have grandchildren. I did it once. I can do it again. I KNOW that whatever happens, it won't be tomorrow. I certainly had some meltdowns. But I surrounded myself with loving friends and family. If you don't have close people who have gone through this, this group will help. And there are support groups. I was a member of a survivor dragon boat team for years. After all the hospital visits and chemo coffees I organized, never thought they would be doing it for me. If you can build loving support with at least 1 Survivor you will learn to laugh again! Sorry for the epistle - good meds!",
