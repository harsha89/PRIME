I am not under chemotherapy since a year now and all my white and red cells are below norm (they had returned to normal about 3 months ago) My oncologist wants us to wait for three months and see the change to this little mass and I don't understand why I should let cancer grow in me.. I contacted my surgeon and she said to wait !  Anyway, I have an appointment with the geneticist 28th march to give my gene analysis.. will ask her many questions! Meanwhile I am meant to relax?!!

Not always but we end up stronger than we expected. I pray for you deeply for a quick recovery and for you to get back on the vaccine trial.. I read about it and it really sound very promissing. Thinking of you and sending you strenghts and courage for you to get through this phase.",

Thank you for sharing!, I was interested to meet patients in this trial to ask about their experience in taking this antibody unfortunately I didn't manage to meet anybody yet!! not many are aware of it and I have a very limited information about this drug. it says that it could be very helpful for us:: but again many studies say the same thing and only our doctors can guide us through the trials and real opportunity in our own particular case.

I am sure you even look nicer in the real life... you can't see the years on your face! Keep going with trying to speak to doctors and get other treatments on the line.. as for the radiotherapy, I always find radiation easy in terms of the time you spend there .. but got to me to be little tiring to do it everyday.. but again we adjust don't we! We adjust to everything in life Minxie. Oh right I remember when you said about this trial before and that the tumour was too small.. are there others you could try to get into.. http://www.immunomedics.com/immu132.shtml https://tnbcfoundation.org/metastatic_trial_search...

I am behind every single one of you!! you are all stars and worriors and am so happy I came here to hear of your stories, your fights, your nice moments and share with you mine, but ended up writing rarely and reading daily! I find writing difficult and I get a lot energy from reading you all. I wish everything was easy but its not.. your last messages are tough to digest but at the same time so inspirational.. all of you are managing in such an inspiring way!  Kaayborg Kaylynne LOTS AND LOTS of hugs and will be praying for you again. Bless you all and may it be easy and smooth at the end for all of us.",
