I had all options on the table but after the mri and finding (yet) another area of concern on the non cancerous side, I opted for having both removed. Like laughinggull I have dense breast tissue and needed the peace of mind of not having to be called back after every mammogram. My surgeon fully supported it and understood my concern the entire time. Also, since I wanted to do a Diep reconstruction and not implants, It made sense to do both since Diep is a one and done chance (or at least that\u2019s how I understood the PS). If you are comfortable not having the second breast removed, stay the way you are. If not, find surgeons who do understand and have it taken off. You are the one who has to be comfortable with your decision.",

I also had a BMX and as far as reconstruction, I will be happy to share with you how mine looked, but remember every person is different and it will also depend on what kind of reconstruction you have. There will be time while you are healing to get the second opinion if you need or want it. ",

Here\u2019s my story: I\u2019m a teacher with no children (by choice) and a very loving older hubby. We have been married 20 years as of this past October. I was diagnosed on August 31 at the age of 44. I have had call backs for every mammogram I had (started at 40) and had a negative biopsy on my left breast last year. When I was called back in for further testing and biopsy, my husband was out of town for work but I wasn\u2019t too concerned. He was headed back when I got the call and fell apart. Luckily my mom lives close by and my best friend also came over and kept me calm til he got home. Two tumors, one 10mm and the other 18. Initially the test had me weakly PR positive, however after surgery and sending out tumor for Oncotype, they couldn\u2019t Oncotype due to Negative hormones, so basically triple negative. Underwent genetic testing and other than finding that colon cancer and precancerous polyps were running rampant on my dad\u2019s side of the family, no genetic defects at this time. Decided to go the double mastectomy route since I already had scares on left side as well and since my tumors were high grade I will be starting chemo the end of January. And lucky me, I have chemo scheduled for Valentines Day! I am going to try to work through chemo as I used up all my paid sick time for the double mastectomy recovery, but will see how I react. Thanks for listening, I have so many things to vent about other posts I have read on this thread but this is long enough!",

As for the drains, I hear you! I had to have revision surgery due to necrotic skin and PS did say drains would be possible but unlikely. Yet, low and behold I woke up with drains anyway. At least I was prepared there might be a possibility. I do not have ER positive BC so I cannot speak to that well, but can say that chemo has been on the table the whole time because of the ER/PR status but was told if lymph nodes were involved then I would have to have radiation. So try not to stress too much about lymph nodes. Keep posting, researching, and being your best advocate. We\u2019re here for you! The waiting is horrible!!! ",

Sounds like you have a different setup from my cancer center since I go right into the same chemo room I stay in for the day. Then they acess my port after about a zillion well being questions, most of which I can answer in advance but a nice safety and well being check up! Then they do blood draw and after results are in doc or nurse practitioner comes in. 5 hours is what they told me it would be but it has always been longer even with no complications. If your infusion rate for c is faster that definitely could be the cause of some issues. Mine is 1:1, I forget the ccs of the bag but something like 345. I may be getting more premeds so that could affect times too. They did not send me to cardiologist but since you do have a history they may be being overly cautious. I am going to ask after my post chemo echo if it is changed and anything to worry about. Poky- glad to hear you are doing well and be careful with that head banging. The 13yo reaction is as expected as is the dogs! It is comforting to be in your own bed and read everyone\u2019s stories. Hope everything keeps going well! Also, I echo that the next visit is for a wbc booster. I get the Neulasta onpro because my insurance covers it but many still do not. Dawmar- I'm surprised the Ativan drip helped but glad it did, it will probably be added to your premed stuff now. Hope everyone is doing well. I am doing slightly better today than usual but didn\u2019t have to work normal schedule as it is an inservice day and I could do most of it from home. Only had to go in for about an hour.",

The taxol will be longer because it takes 3 hours to infuse vs 1.5 for AC. Good luck to everyone starting this week",
