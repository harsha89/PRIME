My incisions for port are so sore, I can barely stand to touch them! I am curious how they will be able to access it, without my jumping thru the ceiling. Any one with suggestions??:-(",

Lol Had my 2nd FEC infusion last Thursday. MO added a patch for nausea this time. Really helped with the nausea, but the fatigue, and no energy is crazy. So this is Day 6, hoping I start to feel more normal soon. Mouth issues are terrible this time, feels like razor blades trying to swallow. Using salt/soda wash/gargle helps just a little. Nothing tastes goodðŸ˜³. Have to make myself eat. Next treatment will be Taxotere. I\u2019ve heard lots of stories about the bone pain from it, so dreading itðŸ˜¢ Today, is a down day. I just wanna curl up somewhere, and do nothing! I know we can do this, it just stinks, some days!! Thanks for listening",
