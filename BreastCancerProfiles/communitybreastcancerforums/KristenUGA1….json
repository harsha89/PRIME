With mine growing so fast, not knowing what it was and being extremely painful, I just wanted it out. Now I just have to deal with my seroma  continuing to come back after being drained. The seroma is causing nerve problems and they have put me on meds to help with that. Pretty painful because of it being in my armpit. AnxietyGirl, even though I have been diagnosed with PASH I'm still very confused. I wish I could help more. My doctor did say it was weird that it was in my armpit because most PASH cases have been on the breast. For some reason mine started growing at the edge of my breast tissue in my armpit. ",

One lymph node was also removed to be tested and all test came back normal on it. I'm not familiar with PASH. From what I have been reading it is rare. My doctor didn't seem too concerned. Now I have been having seroma issues (fluid buildup) My doctor has had to drain the area twice already. She said most likely we will have to drain it a few more times.",
