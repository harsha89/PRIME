    "Content": "ekke wrote: Hi everybody, Ipilimumab (Yervoy), an antibody against CTLA-4, seems to be a very effective treatment for metastatic skin cancer (melanoma) and possibly prostate cancer. It is currently tried in various other tumours, too, Yet, I couldn't find any information if anybody thinks of Ipilimumab for (metastatic) breast cancer, too. If this isn't the case I wonder if this has rational/scientific reasons.Thanks for any feedback. Log in to post a reply",
