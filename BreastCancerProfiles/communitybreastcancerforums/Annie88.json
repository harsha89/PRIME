I had an LX due to it being a 1.5 cm tumor stage 1 grade 1a. The genetic testing is peace of mind. My insurance did not cover the BRCA test, but the testing company called and offered me a price of $100. The insurance did cover the Oncotype test, that is done after you have the surgery. My MO said that if there was no node involvement, the size was less than 2, and Oncotype was low then no chemo. I was most worried about the chemo, as I work w/ elementry children and thought it would scare them. In addition I was concerned about my lowered immunity and having my own children bringing a bug home. The radiation was not complicated, just a disruption to the normal routine. I had to depend on others to give my kids rides from practice and their after school activities. At the beginning I was a little fatigued, but it soon passed. The people at the radiation center were so very nice, which made me enjoy seeing them. Keep your sense of humor and find joy in the small things. Sometimes now I look at my children and just appreciate the smallest moments together, as I know my story could be much different.  Here is an article that was posted about the Oncotype test: http://oncology.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?artic... By the way my BRCA came back negative, which I really don't have the history, but I thought I might be the 1st. Laura",

Like you, I had Pain that radiated from my left breast down my arm. I did find a lump where the pain was coming from. I did have a biopsy, but later was referred by the BS to have a 3D mammo and an MRI. At that time there was difficulty seeing things, due to dense tissue, however there were some micro calcifications. I had another biopsy- mammogram assisted. Luckily the second biopsy didn't result in anything of importance. During the early stage it helped me to exercise to keep my mind off of BC. I would agree with Barbara that taking a friend or family member is good support, as well as a second set of ears. My BS met w/ my mom, mother in law and myself to discuss the plan. Afterwards he gave me a CD with the recordings of the meetings and handouts with illustrations and information. I was so very lucky to find a great BS and MO, as it makes a difference. Hang in there!",

Like you, I have no family history of BC, as I have found many others like this. You have come to a great place for support! There are many caring people here, many have walked the same path. It will give you hope to hear so many stories of survival. As you move through your treatment remember to be strong, but cry when you need to. I have definitely done my share of crying in the last 6 months. Two weeks ago I finished radiation, which I look at as another milestone. There are many milestones during BC. I would say you just had your first one. Best of luck on your journey",

Once you get more information about your diagnosis then you will have more of a plan. The first few months of everything go by fast. I agree with the others that self care and doing things that are of interest are especially important during this time. At first I didn't tell my children, as they are younger, but I did when I knew more of what was ahead. My youngest cried and hugged me extra tight. My older child talks more about the treatments. He has questions about the details. We live in a small community and I haven't openly shared, as I feel my children do not need to have a constant reminder from people offering sympathy. I feel like cancer has pulled the rug out on their security, but it has made us appreciate everything more.it definitely has been a life lesson to us all. We love each other and our time together that much more. CatsRus-stay strong! Support from your family will be everything after your surgery! I will be thinking of you. Virtual hugs as I know this is so hard! Rest and take care of yourself",

It has been hard to not wear a bra, but comfortable. I wear a cotton tank underneath everything for a little coverage. It was funny when I went shopping for the tanks back in January, I must have been the only person shopping for tanks during winter. The nurse said to use Goldbond powder to keep it dry.

My coverage is somewhat in the middle. I pay $282 a month for my kids and I, as my hubby has VA benefits. We have a $300 individual deductible and the max out of pocket is $2000. I feel safe in preparing to pay at least $2000 out a year. The nice part is once you have paid that there are no co payments or fees. I had my surgery in Houston, which is in network, even though we live 7 hours from there.It seems that one really doesn't know the extent of their coverage until they need to use it. I do not feel that my insurance dictates the treatment I receive, but it does influence the amount I must pay for the treatment I choose😀. My father in law lives here in the states half of the year and in Greece the other half. Unfortunately years ago he had a boating accident when in Greece. They have public health in Greece, luckily his friend is a Dr over there and made sure that he received top care. He said that he is sure that he would have lost his arm had he not know someone in touch with the medical community.",

Today was somewhat hectic due to my running late. The treatment facility is 45 minutes to an hour away. They were so nice and told me not to worry, that they will be there until 5. It was really the 1st time I have been late the entire treatment. I left my wallet behind at work, so I had to go back. Friday is the time I pay the RO for treatment for the week. I am just curious is everyone paying a copayment for each day of their treatments or another way?",

I am worried as I read about the boosts that everyone has had, as I had 28 treatments total with no boosts. Believe me, I am not asking for more, but want to know that I have done the necessary regimen. Started Tamoxifen last night and had worrisome BC dreams . For those of you getting started, you will make it to the end before you know it. Mine was a left side treatment. There was a oldster for the legs and a form they made of my back. The RO didn't say I needed to hold my breath, but I did every time I heard the\"beep\".  My insurance was also trying to get out of paying for the MRI, however the BS got it paid. As for the RT, I paid $25 to $30 daily for the treatments. The worst of it is it doesn't come off my deductible, as it is a co-payment. Oh well! Cancer what can you do? It sucks!",

I was diagnosed at 43, a mother of 2 children, ages 10 and 13. My husband and I decided that we would not tell our youngest until after the surgery was completed. My older child was told right before I left for Houston to have my surgery. He turned 14 the day before my surgery. My younger child, a daughter, knew I was sick, but no specific details. We cried as I told her when I returned from my surgery. The thing I struggled with the most, I think, was taking some of my children's security away. Looking back now I realize that my children may benefit from this by understanding that life is a precious gift. Hugs!",

Does your insurance allow you to choose your own Dr? When I was diagnosed in Oct. 2014, I was 43 as well, my search for a Dr began.The first place I looked was MDA, as their reputation surpasses all others. My husband has been a patient there and we cannot say enough! I live in Southern Texas, so it is a 6 hour drive to get to Houston. My husband's family lives in Houston, so I knew that I would go to there. My mother-law's best friend is an oncologist at Methodist, but trained at MDA. I had surgery by one of the most reputable BS, that my oncologist referred me to. I honestly think that it has been the best experience it could be considering. Having confidence in your Drs is something huge, no matter who you pick or where they practice. Shame on your GP for not helpingmake things easier for you, as our journey is difficult enough as it is. We need as much support during these periods of treatments. I am now 2 weeks post op and things are looking up. I hope things get better with your Dr selections.  Hugs-",

In Jan. 2014 I had a mammogram that was clear, but I had arm and breast pain in September that same year. I went to the doctor and they reassured me not to worry, but did give me a sonogram. Sure enough there was a mass that later was biopsied, IDC stage 1 grade 1. There it was cancer, with no family history or reason. I had the BRCA test with negative results. Right away I decided to go to Houston, which is about 6 hours from my home. My I laws live there and have a close friend that is an oncologist, which I chose to see. She recommended the surgeon she would see if she was going through this. I decided to have the lumpectomy, due to it being less invasive and the rate of recurrence being the same. I have children that were already scared and I didn't want to add anymore by having drains and extended recovery. Everything went great with the surgery, I went home the same day. They removed 3 lymph nodes which were negative and also did the Oncotype test with a 5% recurrence rate w/ radiation and Tamoxifen. I did the radiation locally and follow up in Houston. There was no need for chemo as per the Oncotype results. The radiation went smoothly, really the worst part was the 45 minute drive. I have now been on Tamoxifen for 6 months with no great side effects. Like you and many others I wonder what I could have done differently to prevent BC. I now eat as much organic as I can and live active and healthy. You will get through this! When we get through it we are changed forever!",
