I am trying to find a breast specialist but it appears in my area the closest I can get is a general surgeon!!!!!! I made an appointment with one but nobody will give me a straight answer as to whether he sees a high volume of pts with breast disease and or breast cancer and that was asking a breast coordinator at the breast ctr in Waukesha and even calling the office and asking what doc sees the most breast issued pts I was told \"they all do\". I must say the breast coordinator did speak highly of 2 of the doctors names I gave her. Now I just have to wait until the end of March to get in, which is fine I guess since I have already had one of the lumps since mid December. I have found the last few days the lump I have by the nipple is now painful/tender. could this come from not wearing a bra? from pushing on it to \"check it\", you see I am hoping to wake up and find it gone!!!! do you think because it appears to be tender that it is just another one of those innumerable cysts that they found in my Feb imaging(see earlier posts)?? Even though they could find nothing in the 2 palpable lump areas. Answers from all will be greatly appreciated!!!! Log in to post a reply",
