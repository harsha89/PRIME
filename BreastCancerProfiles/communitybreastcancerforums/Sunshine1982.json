After the biopsy I was in a lot of pain. So i used ice packs en a sportsbra for at least a week. The pain went away. last week i started feeling my breast to see how it felt. It felt fine, only a few lumps which were there before. But due to my anxiety i started poking and prodding a lot for a few days. And my breast began to hurt the same as after the biopsy. I stopped saturday with the poking, but now the spot stil hurts. Was the tissue not healed enough? After 4 weeks? or did i bruise the tissue again by poking and prodding while the tissue was still recovering? The NP icalled said give it 2 weeks and if it still hurts she will check me out. Does somebody know if it is possible that the tissue was still recovering after 4 weeks and i bruised it myself?? thanks a lot!! Log in to post a reply",

But from august i have a firm ridge in the lumpectomy area (bottom of breast). The ridge is close to the scar but not parallel to it. More perpendicular. I have small breasts (a cup) and they removed 3 pieces of 1 by 1 inch. So pretty much i quess. The ridge hurts after massaging it for a while so i assume it is also a bit of breast tissue. I know the surgeon displaced some tissue to make the dent less visible which it is. Maybe it is scarring from stitching the pieces internally back together? I had an ultrasound in september which was good. No strange things seen. Does enyone know if this could be scarring? It is a pretty straight ridge and hurts. Thanks a lot!! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Sunshine1982 wrote: hello everyone I am from the Netherlands (34 years old), but I come here a lot to check things out, so maybe you can help me. I am a bit obsessed with my breasts, feel every lump/bump whatever. I let my doctor check every 3 months. But last week I found another small oval thing, and freaked out of course. I demanded an ultrasound and not a mammogram due to dense breasts. So I went and got the ultrasound, radiologist said that is it probably a fibroadenoma and come in for follow up in 3 months. Report said birad 3. But now I am completely freaking out. He said biopsy is not necessary, he is really confident. But what I am supposed to do in the meantime. What if it grows, what if this is a type of cancer which presents itself with benign characteristics? I am losing myself and have been for more than 2 years now due to boob-issues. But this time they actually found something and I have to wait!! I know this is a bc forum, but maybe someone had some advice. really appreciated. thanks! Log in to post a reply",
