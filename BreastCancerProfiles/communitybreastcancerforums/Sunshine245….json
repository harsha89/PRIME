When I asked my Doctor why the core needle biopsy came back showing ATypical Cells he said he couldn't explain why. Nonetheless, I am happy that I can put this behind me.  Just thinking if I am faced with this again, I will opt out of the needle biopsy and just have the excision biopsy. So please, please pass this on. Thank you for your prayers and well wishes. God is Great!!!",

The surgeon never mentioned anything about finding Atypical cells that time. I have asked the DR I am seeing now to get a copy of my records from my previous surgery to see if in fact I had them the last time. Also, I read somewhere that the needle biopsy can cause Atypical cells just by irritating the area.  Geesh...so much information but no answers...  Thank you again and God Bless!",
