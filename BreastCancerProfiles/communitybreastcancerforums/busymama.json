I hate asking for help too so if your friend is the same then maybe just pop over instead of saying 'let me know if you need anything' Things like hanging the washing or offering to do the food shopping. A friend of mine came by and painted my nails :) Sometimes I just wanted someone to make me a cuppa and sit with me for a bit. I agree though, once the first couple of weeks are over people stop offering to help so much. I had a another friend pop by with a hard drive full of new movies. That was awesome. All the best to your friend :)",
