      "Content": "DearMila wrote: Hi All, It all started couple of weeks ago when a mammography screening confirmed the presence of a lump in the upper outer part of my left breast. 3 months earlier I felt certain discomfort while wearing bra. I was also able to feel a lump with my hand. At first, the prognosis was good - doctors were suspecting fibroadenoma, thus I was scheduled for incision biopsy (not needle biopsy). Now, when I have the biopsy result, this seems so wrong as I could have done lumpectomy instead.. It is hard to explain what I've been through for last 2 weeks. First it was the denial - I was not willing to accept that the tumor in the paraffin block I was holding was mine.. Then it was the second biopsy which I requested from another lab. Next it was the consultations with more than 5 surgeons, all claiming that their method is right. And I had different opinions of course, so it was impossible to believe there is a common practice for such cases like mine. Below are the results of the immunohistochemistry: 8 mm tubular invasive ductal carcinoma HER2 1+ negative ER 2+5=7/8 strictly positive PR 2+5=7/8 strictly positive TOP2A 2+ moderate positive p53 1+ weakly positive BRCA1 1+ weakly positive p95 1+ weakly positive Ki 67 1+ (5-10%) weakly positive Bloom-Richardson: 1+1+1 = Total Score 3, Grade 1. Most of doctors here in Bulgaria believe that I should go after an immediate surgery, which I already understood is the right thing to do. What I am not happy with is that none of them talks about breast conservation surgery and I am aged 34, no kids. Meanwhile I talked with couple of clinics abroad and they all wanted to start with a Pet-CT scan so to define the staging of the disease. From everything I read the last days, I should be a good candidate for SLNB prior to ALND, but it seems nobody here in Bulgaria sees things this way. Signing for a treatment abroad seems to be the only reasonable thing to do, although quite expensive. I found quite a lot valuable information on the forums, thus I decided to create an account. I think all I need now is someone to talk/share with, someone who has also been diagnosed with this horrible disease. Because now I need courage and I will need a lot more for what's coming next.

      "Content": "Dec 11, 2013 05:06AM - edited Dec 11, 2013 05:10AM by DearMila That's what I was advised today - that the best way is to go after a hormone therapy for at least 2 or 3 years, than think about pregnancy and if everything goes well, go back to the treatment for another couple of years. I am currently in Istanbul, Turkey. Decided not to waste my time with people guessing how to treat me in Bulgaria. I already had a consultation with both surgeon and oncologist. There are several things I have to do first before they give me their medical opinion though. Most likely, given the tumor being 8 mm HER2 negative, they will stick to SLNB together with lumpectomy. But before that: - Pet/CT scan - Breast MRI - Blood test, including tumor markers - Yet another biopsy of the tumor together with immunohistochemistry for HER2, ER and PR All results should be out by Friday when I will have the hospital's final opinion and recommendation for further treatment. They also said something about Oncotype DX, but only if all of the above tests show no reason to believe there are metastasis.",

      "Content": "Dec 8, 2013 02:18PM - edited Dec 8, 2013 02:22PM by DearMila @ Bessie You are correct, I was never diagnosed with fibroadenoma - it was just suspected from the imaging and never actually confirmed by a biopsy. The tumor was taken out during a planed incision biopsy and under local anesthesia. And then the results from the lab showed it is a carcinoma. I am not quite sure whether the doctors indeed suspected fibroadenoma at first or, they just didn't want to tell me the truth of what they see.. Anyway, I already have second biopsy confirming the first one, and a third biopsy which came with the immunohistochemistry. @ ziggypop You are right about the ER/PR being positive, together with the HER2 negative. Most probably I will have to go through a hormone therapy. But I am a bit worried as most doctors here talk about 4-5 years of treatment. And since I am 34 and with no kids, it looks like I will have to think of an eventual pregnancy at age of 40... I read the forums for some girls having hormone therapies for less than a year. How common is to have such short treatment? To your second question - it is a tough one to answer. Take it this way - things here are happening decades late. Most of the clinics (so as the doctors working in them) are following established/approved standards. And this is what I was answered - for your case we have to follow the procedure, which is mastectomy together with ALND. It really sounds sad. For me having an access to foreign literature and being able to communicate with clinics in Germany, France, Turkey, it not only sounds sad, but it also sounds tragic. And this is why I am more and more thinking in the way Bessie suggested - to try not to rush things so to be able to find a place where I will be able to avoid unnecessary interventions.  What I am really happy with is that you both believe that SNB together with lumpectomy is the right way to go. I came to such conclusion myself couple of days ago but since I am not a specialist I was scared to share it with any doctor. Now I kind of feel happy that I gave myself time to think over everything. Unfortunately this is the sad reality in Bulgaria - no matter how early you are diagnosed and what kind of tumor you have, nobody offers you a personal approach, plus the highly limited options of treatments. Anyway, I have few tough decisions to take this week. One will be whether to go after a Pet-CT scan prior the surgery. Thank you girls for your support, i really needed it!",
