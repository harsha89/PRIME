Can you have them ready next to your bed with a bottle of water? Another idea you may have considered is an adjustable bed. Let the automatic mechanism start to lift your upper body without you having to lift yourself up. Take the Tylenol and a deep breath, and ease on out of bed. I am a year and a half almost from surgery and my degree of pain and range of motion are improving. Just the other day, I got out of the truck at work, the door swung back at me and I pushed it open with my left arm, and the pain didn't zap me and make me want to fall to my knees. Woo hoo! My pain is like a guitar string \"twanging\" and I just have to wait a few moments, breathe, and not panic until the twanging settles down. Hope this helps. There is hope for pain relief. Give it time. Stay as calm as possible while you wait it out.",

I've changed doctors since then, because my old onco didn't think the red nipple was a red flag, so to speak, and he said it was NOT Paget's disease of the breast, which, of course, it is.  Even a woman is right twice a day lol.",

These days, when I have pain, I can often ease it by that gentle stroking. I went to a fundraiser where women at my table said casually that their post surgery friends had the nerve pain resolve itself eventually and so they said just be patient. That meant so much to me.

My breast surgeon's office is very busy, there are (unfortunately) a lot of us breast cancer gals out there. If I'm not comfortable waiting for a callback, or after I do talk with her or someone in her office, I do call them back until I get an answer or clarification. This is NOT like me, usually I'm \"small and meek.\" Suddenly however I am getting very matter-of-fact, it's like I'm two people or one person wearing two hats - I'm the patient and the patient's advocate - so if Karen the patient needs a call or an answer, Karen the advocate steps up and gets that done.

Ok so that was 2010-2011. The left nipple then got flaky and then normal then retracted, tthen looked normal as months went by. The dec 2011 mammo showed a small change inside left breast in area of previous bc. So i git a new onco and bs, and the new bs thought nipple was perhaps excema and said i should get a bilateral mammo in june 2012. In the meantime i was convinced it was Paget disease of nipple based on internet research. Internet as i recall said you can have paget disease of nipple and underlying breast cancer, i forget if the underlying bc is only dcis or if it could also be invasive .... once the anssthesia and pain meds wear off and my brrain wakes up i will revisit what i had researched .... and by then i will have the path results back. I am not surprised by any combo of types of breast cancers, so the way my bc blossomed and the way yours blossomed might be both pagets, if i recall right, the nipple changes can indicate there is pagets inside the breast, which tells me someone might have or could have pagets in the breast without nipple changes. My bs said my left breast dcis is a recurrence, not a new cancer, however the pagets is a new cancer which i interpret to mean the two are separate types of bc?? I have to ask my bc to explain that to me on jan 23 when i get my drains removved. Hope this helps.",

Next i have to call to schedule physical therapy for keeping the lymph moving in the left arm. I have been looking at my options for a medical alert bracelet for my left wrist that I can wear outside the house to alert emergency or medical personnel that that arm cannot have blood pressure taken or a needle stick.... any suggestions? I have always been sensitive to any jewelry that is clunky, I jump when any regular bracelet goes clunk on my desk, and I type a lot at work so there is a lot of potential clunking. Also I never like hard bracelets, they dig into my wrist or leave a mark when I rest my wrist on the work surface. And the medical alert bracelet has to be easy to put on and take off, and it has to be able to get wet when I wash my hands after eating or using the rest room at work. It has to fit no matter what size my wrist is if God forbid I do get lymphedema. The hospital put a hot pink bracelet on my left wrist that reads LIMB ALERT in black letters, it's some type of waterproof paper that sticks to itself, this would be perfect if i could find a medical supply place that would sell them to me, anyway it won't last much longer and I dont want to remove it till I have something to replace it. I've been googling \"bracelets for woman who is a pain in the ass\" with no luck.",

The left side is simply having a more challenging healing experience. I joined a Facebook group called Flat and Fabulous, and another one that is giving me ideas on what I might do next to ease the discomfort. Its not that the pain is bad but I just want a break, you know? I did not have a good PT experience so I'm looking maybe to another medical facility like Hackensack Medical for PT and pain mgmt. The BS was a good surgeon but now I feel cut off from the office of the BS who referred me to the PT/lymphedema office where I had the bad experience. They stopped refilling my Vicodin and honestly I am not sure it was working anymore anyway. I don't want to take so much NSAIDs that I damage my liver of kidneys though.",

I sought a diagnosis for a year and a half and now, finally, I have gotten a team together who is removing the cancer at my bidding.

When I'm in the recliner watching television, or if I have to sleep in the recliner, I elevate my arm on a narrow pillow that I guess is used to prop a baby on when nursing, it's shaped like a \"u\" or a \"j\" and I can actually rest both arms on it as I am kind of wrapping the pillow around me from the front. I can prop the television remote or a dish of ice cream or my iPad on the part of the pillow that tucks around my middle, and this works pretty well.",

I don't even know what kind of lotion I could use, I have googles it and I read something about the pH of the skin and the moisturizer makes a difference for keeping intact or non surgical skin healthy and preventing infection. So I guess it is important to use the right moisturizer on post surgery areas of skin too.",
