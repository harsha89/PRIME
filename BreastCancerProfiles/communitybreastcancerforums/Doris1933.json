I compared right hand measurements against my good arm and the right hand never varies more than 1/2 to 1 centimeter more than the good arm.  Also, something I don't get, is that when my hand looks a little puffy, the measurement is the exact same.   It's so frustrating to me when I don't understand how things work.  You've cleared up a couple things for me, and the internet has helped a lot.  I understand Medicare won't pay for another set of compression garments until next year (10 mos. from now), and neither will Aetna.  Not sure about Aetna, I need to call them.  I'm just going to stop wearing them for a while - that's what my surgeon and onc said I should do anyway.  Besides, my fitter doesn't seem to be very accomodating and won't let me try on any glove/sleeve except the one she ordered for me.  I think I'll  try someplace else.   My therapist and I communicated by phone and e-mail and after about a month she said I didn't need to call her anymore because I didn't have enough swelling.  I feel somewhat abandoned.  Thanks soooooooo much for helping me.

OK, here is my concern:  At night the fluid goes away and I wake up with very wrinkled hand and arm that looks almost the same as the good left hand and arm except for the wrinkles.  Are the wrinkles created because the skin was stretched from the fluid - will they ever go away?  Where does the fluid go - does it find another route and it gets processed through to the kidneys? (Is that why I have to\"go\" 2-3 times during the night?)  After I am up and around for an hour or two the fluid is back again.  Is this the same old fluid that was present the day before and drained during the night, or is this a new batch of fluid overflowing into my hand?  It's not that much and a casual observer does not notice it, but the hand is usually a little puffy until I take time to sit down and massage it.  This cycle is repeated every day.  Sometimes my hand looks entirely normal. I'm sorry to be so detailed, and I thank you so much for reading this and hopefully give me some suggestions.  I've especially been wondering about the same old fluid being sloshed back and forth. Thank hou so much for listening...................Doris in West Memphis Log in to post a reply",
