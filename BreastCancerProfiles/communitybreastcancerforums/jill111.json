    "Content": "Sep 6, 2012 08:18PM - edited Sep 6, 2012 08:21PM by jill111 I finished radiation the 3rd week of JANUARY with the \"usual\" topical burns! Some time in APRIL my upper chest became red and I got a sore throat. With my sore throat, swallowing then became very difficult that it nearly felt like some one was choking me. Then the swallowing issue subsided. But by JULY a burning throat pain began and accompanied  the choking. It hurt so badly I could not stand the pain. So I went to the walk in, they didn't know... I went to my physician, she said it was \"silent reflux\". Of course that medication did not work. I went to an ENT, after he slide a tube down the back of my nose, he said he did not see anything wrong either. I went for an upper GI anyway, everything there looked fine. I went back to the walk in, still- nothing was wrong. FINALLY, I went to a Gastro. I told him of my past history, immediatly he said this is an internal burn deep within the esophagus caused by the radiation. I had an Endoscopy, nothing else showed up. So, he put me on acid reflux meds as well as a pain killer called Tramadol. It is currently helping some but making me VERY tired! By the way yesterday I went to the hospital to meet with the Radiation Oncol. She said my pain has nothing to do with radiation and what has my \"Psych doctor\" said about all this! Nerve does not begin to explain her reaction!!!",
