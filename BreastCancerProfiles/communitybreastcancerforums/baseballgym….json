It's amazing all the similarities between us all. I've started with some major eye twitching just this week, which could be a magnesium thing. Mine is low and I'm taking supplements as well. I also got an IV dose, along with potassium, after my 3rd treatment when I ended up in the hospital with neutropenic fever. This is just an up and down road, which I'm ready to detour far away from. Good luck to some and Congrats to others.",
