My gyn and plastic surgeon sent me to the surgeon to find out what the hard, bone like thing was to make sure it wasn't a new growth. Surgeon said the bone like thing was indeed a bone - it is one of my ribs and not enough skin was put around it so it literally sticks out.",

The right side had a lumpectomy and radiation and then was part of a prophlactic mast. after cancer found in the left breast 11 months later and both breasts were removed. I had immediate reconstruction that failed because of infections on both sides. I then joined the no reconstruction side of the world. In the fall, the plastic surgeon will go in and smooth out everything and hopefully add some extra skin over the rib. I don't wear anything tight as it would show. The whole process soured me on reconstruction and I feel like young girl again just going without. I don't wear a bra just looser things and don't feel self conscious at all.",
