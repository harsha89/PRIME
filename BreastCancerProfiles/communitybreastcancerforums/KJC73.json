After that, my OB suggested to start having annual mammograms. I'm now 40. I had my annual mammogram yesterday and was told I have a 1.4 cm spiculated mass. I'm going in for an ultrasound tomorrow morning. (I was surprised how quick they wanted me to come in. They were trying to find a way get me in today). I made a mistake searching Dr. Google because I didn't know what \"spiculated\" meant and am now freaking myself out. Is what I am reading correct. Like an 80-95% chance malignancy? Please don't sugar coat. I can totally handle it. The unknown and confusion is what is stirring my brain. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
