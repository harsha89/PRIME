    "Content": "Oct 23, 2015 04:12PM - edited Oct 23, 2015 04:14PM by sandib65 I believe I will have bilateral mastectomy in late November or early December. I really want them to remove both breasts because all women on my mother's side of the family have had breast cancer but doctor won't approve double mastectomy. I don't think I can handle this again if there's a recurrence in my healthy breast! How can I get my doctor to approve double? I have 2 more chemo treatments and then I'm done with chemo. I'm dreading mastectomy. I am a size 20/22 and haven't been able to find much help for wardrobe issues for curvy women. I am also at a loss for finding any info about breast size reconstruction. Because I also have to do radiation I have to have delayed reconstruction. I am a 42 DD bra size and am very worried that the reconstruction won't match my 50-year old slightly saggy breast and/or if they can even reconstruct that size breast. I'm very depressed and anxious.",
