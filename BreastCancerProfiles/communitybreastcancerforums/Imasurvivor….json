      "Content": "Jan 9, 2009 10:32PM - edited Jan 9, 2009 10:34PM by Imasurvivor All of the nails on my hands lifted completely where they were loose all the way back, but a very little on each side stayed attached and held them on.  I clipped them extremely short so I wouldn't catch them and pull them off.  You never know how much you depend on your nails until you don't have them.  I was referred to a dermatologist and he was very laid-back about the situation.  He told me to cover them with dark nail polish and no one would know.  He said if I was a man he would tell me to clip them all the way back, but beings I was a woman, he didn't think I'd like that look.  I don't have time for nail polish so I left them alone.  It was early-December that this all happened.  I have been taking Biotin since October because it was obvious back then that I had a problem - nails were dark and painful.  I did use tea tree oil, to no avail.  They are growing in normally and are already between 1/4 and 1/3 of the way back even though the Dr. said it would take 3 to 6 months.  Nothing happened w/toenails except they are sore.  Dr. said my nails were photosensitive from the chemo.  Makes me wonder if a dark nail polish from the get-go would have saved them.",

I also have been complaining of rib pain on the noncancerous breast side and they have ignored me on that, too.  They are also going to do a bone scan on 4/7.  It will be interesting to see if there is damage to my lungs.  Please let us know what you find out.",
