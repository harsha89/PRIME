I did it, not knowing any better. I did it last Tuesday, and when I left the hospital that night the breast looked great and felt so light. I thought WOW! He was right! Well, since last Tuesday, the breast is starting to feel a little full, and appears to be a little bigger again:-( only draining 10-15cc a day. Reading your post today made me feel more hopeful about treating it, and not spending the rest of my life on antibiotics. Thanks again for the info!!!",

I was fine for 7 months, and then out if nowhere I got I really bad infection, I was put on antibiotics for 2 weeks, then 4 weeks later it was back. I was in the hospital for 2 days on IV antibiotics, and then 2 more weeks of oral antibiotics. No one at the time was able to tell my why I was getting infections. 3 weeks later another infection. I went to see the ID doc, who told me I had lymphedema of the breast. He told me that I need to take a low dose antibiotic for LIFE!! because the infection will come back. Has ANYONE had infection like this that stop after seeing a LT? Or are antibiotics for life my only choice? Dx 12/22/2009, DCIS, 4cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, 0/0 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

The fustrating thing about all of this other than being told you have it, is the mixed answers about it. From reading online you have some people who call ADH pre cancer, and some who say it is just a higher risk for development in my lifetime. This makes it hard as to what to do. If in fact it is pre cancer that sounds and is a little bit more of a concern than as my BS put it , \"Out of 100 women, 5 will go on to have BC, with ADH \" Out of 100 women 19 will go on to have BC.\" when it is put in prespective that way, it sounds like SUPER CLOSE follow up with exam would be ok . WOW! so very much to think about. Again thank you for your prayers and sharing your story and that of your friend. Nicole-",

I have no fam history, but I do have dense breast. .BS said that @ 37 not sure if she would recommend TX right now. I was just wonder if there are any women on the fourm that only have the ADH and have taking the close screening route and for how long? this is such a scary thing! I Don't know if I should focus more on the 20-25 percent that do go on to have bc or on the 75-85 percent that do not ever get it. would love to hear from long time screeners. Thanks In Advance!
