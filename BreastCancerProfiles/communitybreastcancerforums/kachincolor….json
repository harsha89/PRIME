Sigh. Time for a new drug. I have one MO saying Navelbine should be my next move. Another MO states that I should consider doing Halaven. I know everyone reacts differently to different drugs. I have heard that this is tougher than Navelbine but over on the Navelbine thread it seems like quite a few women are having a tough time with Navelbine. How are you finding Halaven? Any thoughts if you have experience with both of these would be greatly appreciated. MRI (for persistent headache) and PET scheduled for Friday morning. I expect progression but am hoping to avoid brain mets. Trying not to be too frightened right now. Doxil has been the only drug that has worked for me so I am working hard at trying to stay balanced.

I have NEVER taken such a big step with so little information since I was diagnosed in January, 2015. Anyway, I had a horrible time at Mayo Clinic. It is wild how sometimes the \u201cgreat clinics\u201d near us just don\u2019t work out and the \u201cgreat clinics\u201d away from us work out. I liked my Mayo Oncologist but everything seemed to slip through the cracks and I could never get ahold of the same nurse or asstant. My MO even bragged that her assistants shielded her from too many patient calls. That is when I concluded that this was not the place for me. I think areas have certain trends in their approach and I just like having a quarterly relationship with my MO at Dana Farber. I have a son who lives in Boston to it is fun to come see him on a quarterly basis as well. Won\u2019t know what my chemo regime will be when WBR is done but will check back in to see how you all are faring. Warm blessings, Kimberly",

When I was diagnosed with MBC within a year of being treated with chemotherapy for stage 1 cancer, I wanted to get some perspective outside of the Midwest where I live. I went to Dana Farber and really liked why the consulting MO had to say. So both my MN MO and my Dana Farber MO collaborate on my case. Which is really good because yesterday I thought my scans would just tell me how much more progression I would have in my bones/liver. Today they discovered doing a brain MRI that I have more than fifty teeny tiny brain tumors. So no chemo for me until we finish whole brain radiation. Sigh",

My last scan was the 16th of August and showed significant progression. I am pretty careful with food and supplements. All have been approved by my MO. I have been a bit blue -- just not handling this situation as well as I would like. Tough to share negative news to my husband who lost his first wife to cancer and to our six kids. I try to keep everything but the \"big stuff\" (scan results) to myself just to keep the temperature down. Hearing about high liver enzymes (first time) after two weeks on Doxil has really hit me hard. I know it shouldn't. I know that two weeks is nothing. It is just that the pain is getting worse, my skin is getting itchy and my breathing is being affected. And I have found the first two weeks on Doxil pretty hard. Makes me second guess if I should have gone on a clinical trial that I was afraid to participate in because one of my two oncologists was concerned the trial wouldn't knock back the liver tumors fast enough. Both MOs agreed Doxil was the next best step if I didn't participate in the trial. Of course this situation is something that all of us deal with every day. I just keep praying, as I am on my fourth treatment since August 2016, that something kicks in soon! Again Bluebird-DE thank you for your thoughts! Off to go research!!! Hope to follow in the footsteps of the amazing women here who have got the research of clinical trial stuff down! With love and hope, Kimberly",

I was in serious liver trouble in August but Doxil has knocked the beast back significantly and I have been enjoying less pain and being able to eat. My skin stopped itching which was a huge relief. I burst out laughing when you said to give thanks for nose hairs!! So true! Quite sick of my dripping nose and love affair with Kleenex.
