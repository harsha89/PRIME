She did not die from cancer, but she had it a few years before her death and had to have a mastectomy. This past year, July 2014, I discovered a lump in my right breast and I scheduled an appointment with the doctor, and she referred me to a cancer surgeon. The cancer dr. found the lump, had a mammogram done and they said my tests had changed considerably since my last mammogram so she decided to do a biopsy. The tests came back, according to her, as fibrocystic disease. They scheduled me another mammogram for my right breast only in 6 months. Before it was time for my mammogram, I discovered another lump about the size of a pea underneath that same breast and a lump on the top part of my breast. Went back to the dr. She checked it and said she felt it but she still thought it was safe to wait on the mammogram. So in Feb. of this year, I had the mammogram done. Tests came back okay she said. So I asked her what was the lumps I was feeling? She checked the one on top and said she felt it but thought it was fibroid. She couldn\u2019t find the pea size one on the bottom. Then before I left, she said the lump on the top of my breast was just muscle tissue. I told her I just was not going to do self exams anymore because obviously I didn\u2019t know what I was looking for. But yesterday, I decided to go ahead and do an exam. Once again, I felt the pea size lump and also the lump on top and they are hard and don\u2019t move around. But I am going to wait until my mammogram in July because I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m just paranoid. I just don\u2019t want to end up waiting too long if it was to be cancer. And since I have a history of it in my family, it makes me more concerned. If it\u2019s fibroids then great! But if it\u2019s not....... Log in to post a reply",
