That's rather graphic, but that's how bad mine was. I had the pain in my chest (sternum) for over a year and doctors were treating me for something called \"costochondritis\", which is an inflamation of the cartlidge between the sternum and ribs. I took anti-inflamatory drugs and steroids and nothing helped. I saw 3 different doctors and they all had the same diagnosis. Finally, I went to the ER because the pain was so bad and a simple x-ray show a large mass in my sternum and the bone looked like it was moth-eaten according to the x-ray. Cancer was also found in my spine and my lung. Bone mets pain does not go away!!!",

I'm starting Abraxane tomorrow along with the Herceptin and Zometa. I'm anxious to have another PET scan to see exactly what this \"monster\" is doing inside me! I live alone so I didn't have help undressing but I only wore what was absolutely necessary. It hurt just for my clothes to touch my chest. I agree, though, if you can't find laughter in a situation, then you're beaten before you begin to fight.",

I also have to go back on Tu,We,Th for a shot of Neupogen. I'm worried about the abraxane because I have myelodysplastia, a blood disorder that destroys white blood cells. Did the apraxane cause anyone blood counts drop very much? When I first had bc in 2001, I tried chemo and my counts and platelets dropped so much and so fast, I was hospitalized in isolation. I'm scared of this chemo but without it my chances of survival are very slim. I'd appreciate any info anyone has on this drug. When do the side effects start? Thanks",
