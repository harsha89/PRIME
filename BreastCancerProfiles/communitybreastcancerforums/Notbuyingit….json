I can understand bras & such irritating after a time - they used to even before - but why does it hurt so much to wear nothing? I am down to a very small B/A so there's certainly not a lot of droop pressure. finally found a pain doc who tried some injections - lidocaine/novacaine & then some steriods. Worked for a whole 5 secs :( she was excited because i could lift my arm - trouble is i could do that before i came in ha! mobility is not my issue...just pain >sigh< i fell on my boob just a week after my last recon surgery & have always wondered if my implant was damaged or pushed into bad position - can they tell this with x-ray? or does it have to be the dreaded MRI?
