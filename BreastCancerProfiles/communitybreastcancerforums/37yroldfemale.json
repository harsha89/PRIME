Well here lately I have been having like a hot sensation to my left breast that comes & goes & it is also warm to the touch. All I do is stay inside my air conditioned apartment. I don't excersize or do any strenuos lifting or anything. The only time I go outside is to go pay bills or go to the grocery store. I haven't had any injuries to my left breast. My left breast is much bigger than my right breast. I have noticed a red scar under my left breast that isn't healing. It has also been there for several months. I have also noticed that I have a red pimple looking mark on the middle right side of my left breast, but its not raised. I have also noticed some skin changes to the top of my left breast & it almost looks like a start of early pitting & its like a reddish, pinkish color. I have also noticed, under my left breast there is some pinkish color. I don't have any pain in my right breast. But what's weird is, my right breast is so small compared to my left breast. I have also noticed when I breath in, I get this weird feeling on the top left side of my left breast & it feels like a bump on the inside of left breast if that makes sense. I haven't breast fed in over 10 years. Every month when I get my period, both of my breasts are sore. But then after my period is over, my right breast isn't sore anymore but my left breast still continues to be painful, even weeks after my period. I have also noticed my left nipple is red & sore also. Then yesterday morning I noticed, my left lymph node under my neck is raised compared to my right side. I called my OB & I have an appointment for Thursday. Im Really worried & I don't know what's going on! I know nobody can diagnose me. I would just like to know what's going on.
