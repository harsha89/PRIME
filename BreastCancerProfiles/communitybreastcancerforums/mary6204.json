The only thing I'm actually actually answering about your questions is regarding the mascetomy because my Mom had one.  She had breast cancer at age 80. Since it was hormone receptive she had radation and took Tamoxifen.  Before the 5 years were over, she had a reoccurance and had a masectomy.  It had already spread and she died less than two years later.  Although I am dreading chemo, for me it's the only answer.  The good news is my Mom was 84 yrs old when she had her breast removed.  Three days after surgery she was on a chair taking down pictures because they were moving.  She had almost no down time.  From what I've talked to with other people, I think a lot of it is more mental than anything else.  Boob's meant nothing to my Mom so she got over it very quickly. especially for her age.  Everyone is different, but I wish you luck with your situation.  I am grateful that my surgeon did not feel a mascetomy would do me any good.  I've had 3 minor surgeries in the past 6 weeks, including having the port installed. Frankly, I'm tired of having to give up my coffee in the mornings.  Good luck and God Bless you, Mary",

Oh well, if I can get relief from a drug like this I'll take it.  I just hope it keeps helping and I can get through this.  I know I'm one of the lucky ones, but sometimes it's hard to realize it.  Thanks again for the advice gals, Mary",

Otter, there's a place called ultimatelooks.com  that also charges a 15% restock fee, however, the first exchange is free.  Don't know if that helps. I am feeling bad today, but I think I need to eat.  Nothing sounds good.  I'm going to suck it up, get dressed, try the pressure band with my wig and go to dinner with my husband.  I hope it helps.  I'm out of Zofran, so I need to get that filled as well.  Mary",

Besides the Zofran, I just got a script for tigan but I haven't used it yet.  2 of the doctors in the group I see, 1 of the nurses as well as a pharmacist told me do not take the anti-nausea medicine until you need it.  They all have side effects as well and if you take it before it's needed sometimes it won't work when you do.  Compazine is known to cause a lock-jaw like symtom, but only if it builds up in your system.  However it didn't do anything for me. I actually do best on a home remedy that's not recommended so I won't say what it is. I've heard from women that swear by each individual drugs so it proves everyone is different.  Good luck, I think in the beginning it's a guessing game.  Some women don't get the nausea at all; must be nice!!!!  Mary",
