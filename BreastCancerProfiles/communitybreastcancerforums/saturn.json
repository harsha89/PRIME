I talked to a nurse friend of mine (unfortunately she lives in another state), and she said something similar happened to her DH and that his was an infection.  So... today I will be trying to find an ear/nose/throat dr to take a look ASAP before I begin my radiation on Wednesday.  Hope I can get in.     I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar?",

My arm IS a little funny-looking and motion is not full, so I know there is something there but glad it isn't bad.  I will continue the exercises/MLD and wear a sleeve as needed, and keep an eye on it. I do have a question re. radiation and the armpit... I read that that can make LE worse.  Should I have any concerns?  I will definitely mention to the radiation team, but of course I'm worried it will be ignored! Oh, one more \"yay\"... my husband told me today he will no longer be smoking in the car but will stop for any smoke breaks he needs.  We're in the car a lot together because we show property together (we're realtors).  I am so thankful he has come to his senses!",

Update: I was just looking and found it at another website... vitacost.com.  It is $3.88/tube and their shipping is $4.95 per order no matter quantity.  Never have used them though so cannot make comment on the company.  Just wanted to pass info along.",
