    "Content": "rodell wrote: Hi, I am a Canadian who moved to New York for my job in 2006 and was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, I had a bilateral mastectomy after finding out I was BRCA2 positive and followed those surgery dates with a complete hysterectomy and ooph.  All surgery and care was in the USA. In the spring of this year I moved back to Canada and live in the Mississauga area, I have started seeing a GP here who has just completed my first physical since coming home.  Yesterday his office called to say they needed to see me about my ultrasound.  They found a 8 mm \"leison\" that according to the radiologist does not appear to be suspicious.  Dr wasnt sure how to proceed.  I am getting a copy of my last breast ultrasound in the USA sent up here and have decided that I need to get set up with a specialist here to determine if it is scar tissue or what is going on. Can anyone give me some advice with regards to Hospitals and Breast Cancer Dr's that have provided timely and knowledgable service?  I meet with my GP Tuesday and think it would be best if I have done some homework to discuss where I would like to be refered. Thanks for your support! :)     Dx 5/22/2009, DCIS, 3cm, Stage 0, 0/3 nodes Log in to post a reply",
