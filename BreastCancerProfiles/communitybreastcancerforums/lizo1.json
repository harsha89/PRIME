Triathlon, cycling, snowboarding, skate skiing, beach volleyball... great times. Liz has had a couple of knee reconstructions that were sport related. She was forced to modify activities and intensity. If treatments go well, we'll do some classic skiing soon as her knee doesn't like skate anymore. We swam yesterday and she did her pilates this morning. Resting now and mentally preparing for onc appointment on Tuesday. Grant",

This is a journey and I pray for Liz and all of you that you can continue to be active and do the the things that bring you joy! Liz is getting discouraged with the pain in her hip as it's beginning to affect her ability to be active. I do my best to keep her optimistic. I'm praying and optimistic that it is just a muscular thing and it will resolve itself after time. Grant",
