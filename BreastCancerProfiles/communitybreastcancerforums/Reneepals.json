The pain and s/e have taken a toll, feeling like your 85 when your in your 40's because of arthritic pain. Weight is a definite issue. I refuse to wear anything tight, maybe a spank on special occasions. But I'm a flannel pajama pant/ Tank sweatshirt type a girl. So I look like I just got out of bed all the time. I give you alot of credit Lorraine, seriously. I really do miss my hair. Yesterday my very best friend took me to a very exhausting treatment appointment. We were in the car coming home, It was very hot and humid. She took her hair and twisted it up in a tie. I look at her very seriously and said, Yup if I had hair, I would be tying it up too and did the boo lip. We were hysterical laughing at that point.",

I take Lexapro, without  God & Lexapro, I could not function. Really it helped me soooooooooooo much . I was scarred S---less 2 months ago , I could not look anyone in the eye and when I had time to think about my dx , my thighs were in so much pain from fear! Who gives a crappola about the hair. I can remember how at 1st it was such a big deal.I was devastated. But now looking back in retrospect. Whats the alternative? I'll take the loss of hair any day. Beside doing funky things with scarves, hats and wigs it was pretty cool  (not the chemo) and believe it or not my darling husband thought I looked the best bald. Hearing from you about how your husband is with you, I am sure he was ok with it then and will be ok with it now. (believe me I pray for you to keep you hair). I have to use a heating blanket sometimes for my rib mets and it works, its weird I have mets on my rib in the back, but I get referred pain under my breast, freaky. Anyway try heat, it works. If it really really hurts I'l take Tylenol and if that doesn't work I'll take a Vicoden. But for the most part I really do not have to take alot of pain meds. Thats because of the praying.Also a big must , remember to use Udder Butter on your feet. The A.I's have dried my skin out and I slather (If that is even a word) it on my feet , put heavy cotton socks on and your good to go. Do it from the start of chemo, this way you do not get the cracked heals, be proactive on that! I remember how the chemo really tried to tear my heals up, the Udder Butter was a life saver.They say biotin helps wiith the nails and hair , I do not know to much about that. So check it out with your Onc. Well I  have been very long winded, I am so sorry....hehehehehehe Have a very Merry Christmas &  May 2009 be your best year yet!",

You have no idea how our talk is getting me through my current chemo treatment. You gave me the \"balls\" to wear my chemo scarves with class, dignity and one might even say a feeling of sexiness. Your words of encouragement and your explanation of things you have gone through have given me the strength to say bring it on. (The chemo).

As you know my Petscan lit up a little on my liver, but on the ctscan there is nothing there that anatomincally corresponds with the uptake...hmmmmmmmmmmmm... well my tumor marker came back for my Cea and it is down another 15 points from 65. hmmmmmmmmm again. I went to see my onc today. She feels that there is no evidence of progression, she also spoke with the radiologist, who also felt that the results are inconclusive with the info we have. Everything is contradicting.  Also I was told that Petscans have a 20 percent false positive rate.....Ho hummmmmmmmmmmm..Well after much discussion, we have decided to stay on the Femara, Zometa & Lupron. We are also going to do another Petscan/ Ctscan in 2 months instead of three. It takes alot to make decisions like these. But if you and your onc agree on what course to take. Go with your gut and a little expert opinion. I just looked at my onc at one point and she looked at me and said,\" Your doing great, it's going to be ok, we just have to stay 20 steps ahead of this, but I do not feel comfortable with changing a treatment that is working\". Save big guns for much later, that's my feeling. Chemo really left me with residual neuropathy. If we can avoid this, why not? Luv you Luann and I wish, I had the answers... Dang! you have been so helpful and I can't even return the favor. I pray you find your answers Hugs",

I have been on Femara for 8 months now and my liver met? Gone! (per Petscan @ 6 months) I am praying to God for years and years!  I to am very grateful to forgo chemo. It's all what your comfortable with. Just a note my tumor was also highly Er & Pr positive. What was really strange to my Onc and got her very excited is that my pain almost immediatley vanished when I started taking Femara.  The s.e. are no where as bad as chemo (had it when first dx'd in 2006) But truthfully, I have alot of pain from joint issues, which now is subsiding. I work full-time and only go to the gym twice a week. I walk usually 3 times a week. So my quality of life is very good!....... I have had a weight gain of 30 pounds and it is because of Lupron I am told........... But I am ALIVE.... So in the big scheme of things not a big deal. Hope I was of some help,",

Two BIG Newfoundland's (SP) attacked us. So strange they are usually very big goofy firendly dogs. But they attacked like mad pit bull's. The owner didn't have them leashed and someone behind me called them. Well the look on the owner's face was oh SH**. He knew something wasn't right. All of a sudden they started galloping toward me. I started screaming and tryed to grab Stella. But there wasn't enough time. One of them came up behind me and the owner was able to control him. But the other one got a hold of Stella by the neck and was thashing her around like a rag doll. She screamed like a baby. I don't know what happened to me but, I just started stomping on this dog,right on his shoulder and his neck area. He dropped my baby and I picked her up and she was in complete shock, wouldn't move. The owner was so upset he kept on asking if she was ok and children were crying. But miraculously there was not a mark on her, no skin break nothing. My hubby is with her now, but when I get home from work, I am taking her right back down there. I do not want a squirrly dog. My poor baby!",

Seriously , I think stress had a lot to do with why, I got Breast cancer in the first place. You would not believe the  drama, I had in my life (if I could write a book)........ To get back to you! You say that you are sleeping a lot more than usual, that is the number #1 sign of depression. You definitely might have a need to talk with someone and/or get meds.

There has to be a way. I totally understand your reason for staying. But to be so lonely when you have a loving family. We all-ready have so much to deal with. If you are asking yourself if it is worth it, then you all-ready know the answer. Gale, I wish I had the right words to tell you. all I do know is you were up here a little while ago and didn't want to go back. Maybe you could get a separation and he would have to keep you on the insurance.Then ssi would kick -in. You crying all the time isn't healthy for you.You should be enjoying your life.Your Husband is pretty good about alienating you. There are great doctors at Yale, some of the best! I can point you in the right direction. Don't fear that. I'm here for you, we all are. Talk to me baby!",

Sal you do no its stage 4 cancer right?  Mom this to shall pass, I pray all the time, I even got daddy praying for you. (my Ex.....wow).

Fitz, my sister tells everyone of my stage 4 status, I actually had to cancel going to a get together at her house and when asked why by my sister, I had to tell her since she reduced me to the role of cancer girl, I would have to pass...Needless to say she has now resorted to telling everyone, Don't let Renee know I told you....... Did I mention that she has Non-hodgkins Lymphoma and gets treatment for it evey 3 months....I really do think it makes her feel \"safer\" saying I am stage 4! But its all-right, I still love her even though she is ignorant.hehehehehe.....",

It was like....... Hey were did those black -n- blues come from?!!!!! I am in a clinical trial with Faslodex & Tykerb. Tykerb (maybe, maybe not). I had to go on a 2 week washout, which brought on unbelievable pain from my rib met. Long story but it is somewhere on this thread. I can truthfully say that all the lousy symptoms from Femara are gone, except the extra weight I packed on. My joints feel great! I did have to get the loading dose which means equal pain for both sides. I hoped that helped a little.",

BFF is super uber hypersensitive and her mind is going places you could never imagine, unless it was in fact, you. I didn't see where the BC had metastasized to? If I was reading correctly it would be considered stage 3 (I think) unless you had just forgot to post it, because of being scared & confused. You really need to write everything down for her because she is going to have information overload. Right now is such a difficult time for her to process what is going on and what is her new reality. Her emotions are going to be all over the place. There will be times when she won't be able to get up out of bed. It is mentally crippling. But she will rebound back and be ready to fight............... Be careful of the Internet. Most of the statistic's are old. They are statistics skewed for different treatments and different protocols. This is a great place to be for a lot of the info she will need to fight. It is not her end all. That would be her Oncologist & second opinions. Convince her to post. If you need any help alot of us will be here for BFF & you. P.s. I can't remember, but if she didnt have a biopsy make sure she does, where-ever her mets may be. It mean's a lot on how to decide her treatment. Hugs & More Hugs",

See I think most of us ladies know that we are in a brutal battle, that this could kill us. But to be so hard on someone who wants to believe there is a chance she can out live your stats, is just plain mean. I am one of those ladies who wants to hope, wish, and deny, if it gets me through the course of all my pain, physical and mental, its not anyone's job to tell me no matter what, that I am going to die........... Yeah maybe I should just think the worst, stop fighting and just go die for statistics sake. For the most part, I used to come here all the time. But the make-up of the stage 4 thread had changed. I find it very cynical and it was never, never that way before.  A lot of the \"Old Timers\" are lurking. I miss them and their advice. Tontoandme, my onc tells me that she has patients 10 & 15 yrs out with Liver mets. she would not lie for my sake. She is the director of the breast center that I go to. She is a research scientist who in charge of quite a few clinical trials. I am sure she is not lying to me to make me feel better. Her reputation is very important to her and the hospital. You keep hoping and praying. Cause I am right there with you.",

It all depends on your mothers type of breast cancer and the treatment options her Oncologists bring to her.  What I am trying to point out to you is that with stage 4, the thought process is to try to get as much as you can with each treatment and then you have to move on to the next. There are many, many treatments for us. But the side effects are what really take a toll on us. Managing them is key to our quality of life. It seems like you are really going to have to advocate and push for what treatment your mom wants. It is great that she has you to inquire about and research her options. Please continue to come here and take with you any valuable info and post about your mom's journey. Lots of hugs",

I do it once a day. It is so frustrating to me. I'll be working away then all of a sudden out of no where. I want to trade this body in, hello another body please! Tumor markers, Liver function, Bili labs, scans.... Ugh! Wait, wait, wait. I just need to know that the treatment is working. P.s. I am so sorry, I am of no help at all.",

When I was dx'd with Stage 4, (Oct 08) I was immediately treated with Femara, Lupron, and Zometa. I am doing that combo right now. So you have already done Femara and Tamoxifen, did you do Lupron also? Or did they surgically remove your tubes and ovaries? Oh by the way, totally off subject you are the spitting image of a cousin of mine. p.s. What part of the country are you from?",

But now for me it is every once in a while. Every week it is a different side effect from the A.I's, but in my head that makes me think it's working. I'll take it. Heidi do you have a lot of bone mets? That they would tell you not to exercise? I try to be as active as possible, but alot of the time I can't. Sometimes Combat fusion class, sometimes bed, sometimes walking, sometimes the couch, sometimes stationary bike, sometimes lying on the floor. I am just thankful that I am still somewhat active. It's all a matter of finding the new \"normal\".",

I guess removing the primary helps decrease the tumor load. The article is right here in our research news as soon as you log on. I would think removing the tumor would be beneficial. It's not a cure but at least it's getting rid of cancer. Of course you would still have to be on treatment. After all we are stage 4.",

You can do this. Your going to MSK one of the best Hospitals in the country. I really hate when docs give us an expiration date. Only god knows. I just got done reading all the posts here and there are a few ladies who have responded very well to treatment. I hear and understand your despair. Our children & families are the other victims of Cancer. It breaks our children & spouses down. It bothers me how they are forced to deal with losing us. Sure we know how frightening it is to face death. But I can only imagine the pain and fears our families go through. Heidi, I will continue to keep praying for you & your family. The only advice I can give is to get your head as \"right\" as you can, surround yourself with your children & family. I find that it is the only time I am truly happy. With the support of your loved ones and whatever your belief system is, you can do anything.",

I am a little weak emotionally and know that being with earlier stages would make me envious and I don't want to feel that way. Plus the fund raiser is not for a cure. It takes a lot for me not to get depressed and I just couldn't comfortably put myself in that position. I am happy for them not being stage 4 believe me, I do not wish this on anyone. It might sound crazy, but I do fundraising for the \"Heart Walk\" so helping is not the issue. It is the cause that is the issue, it is too close to home at this point. Also it does piss me off that \"Awareness\" is as good as it gets. Hello! Me and  bunch of other ladies & gentlemen are stage 4. Cure would be a great new push in Breast Cancer fund raiser's",

Hehehehee, I want to be unreachable right now! Navelbine, hmmm. I am on it right now. At first I hated it. But my Onc drop the dose (I am still taking a therapeutic dose). There were times I felt as if I needed a crane to lift me out of bed, from fatigue and nausea. But with the dose reduction everything has gotten better, much better. For the last 2 weeks, I have not had to take my nupogen shots (hallelujah) They are a culprit of my fatigue. One thing I have noticed, the steroids they give me get me so hyped up and give me stomach upset. So reglan is my new best friend! I have had some hair thinning. Which pisses me off major. But the results I have gotten have made it worth it.",

Don't you think that they should check and see if the chemo did damage?  Remember to drink water and lots of it, my Hubby used to drive me nuts with the water issue .

Reading post's on these board's, I have noticed and this is only my opinion. That treatment standard depend's on where in the country you are, what type of hospital you go to get your treatment or if you get it at a oncologist's office. There are a lot of different factor's that go into a Oncologist recommending the treatment that is good for you.",

It is true that a lot of Oncologist's would not opt for surgery with a Stage 4 BC patient. The horse is already out of the barn and they treat it systemically. There are trials out there to see if surgery has it's benefits for us.   I wanted the lesion on my Liver removed immediately, but because I also had bone mets my Onc is not on board. She said we would revisit that if my Liver got out of control.  I do see that we are being treated differently. After all everyone's cancer is different in so many ways. We should have more targeted therapy. Why should we have to comply to \"standard treatment\". My Onc does think out of the box, but  every soooooooooo slowly. If you feel that you really want it out, go set a second opinion, I would. edited to add: Once I saw that Femara did such a great job of sending my Liver met into exile. There is not a need at this point for ablation.",

But it is also true, there is nothing you can do except wait until you see the doc. I do not know if you believe in God, but it helps me so much to pray and to read the bible. It gives so much calm in times of chaos and trouble. Spend alot of time with people you truly love that is a huge relief. Good long movies are also helpful to get your mind off things until you see the Doctor. Get out of the house and spend alot of money, (helps sometimes :).............. Do you have any hobbies? Anything that helps and gets your mind off things. I'm here if you need me. Take care Hugs",

Dry as all heck and DARK...(Yucko) I thought that the udderly smooth cream that I have been friggin using all along was Paraben free, but low and behold, I read the label with my glasses on and finds, Uh yeah there is!  So now I go on this label reading frenzy on all my cosmetics and health and beauty aids (believe me I got lots, I need it) Well my liquid foundation / Parabens, My deodorant yes I said deodorant has Soy!  So now I am on a personal quest to hunt these products out. So far I have gotten in contact with Origins and I am waiting on a 2nd reply back, because the response Representative over there has got to contact their Laboratories to get the correct ingredient info. So if anybody has any info on any Soy free and Paraben free Cosmetic's or Lotions. please list. Renee Log in to post a reply",

I have a lot of pain issues. But 5 kids! I could not even imagine throwing that into the mix. I love Heidi's idea about  lying on the couch with a megaphone. In all seriousness, I don't mean to be bossy, but you need a work schedule for the kids to help out. Cause mommy you need sleep and alot of it (it's when the body repairs itself). Even cat nap's during the day should help. Now I am not saying to become Rip Van Winkle, but you get the idea.",

The way he has Chris blowing through chemo's is ridiculous and scary. I know I am not a Oncologist but don't you have to do a series of chemo treatments and then SCAN before deciding whether it is working or not. Someone please tell me if I am wrong. I thought the idea of treatment for us stage 4 gals is to squeeze every bit of time out of each treatment. What is he doing? Chris deserves better than this and so do you! It is just freaking me out. At the rate he is going with Chris she is going to have nothing left quick. Robin it is so funny that you mentioned Parp Inhibitors, they are all over the news tonight..... New cancer wonder drug for aggressive Breast & Ovarian. This is awesome news, something like 41 percent response rate! All I can say is woohoo! Is this the new targeted therapy for trip neg's?",

Besides lots of things can make our liver enzymes go up. Ask for a Pet or MRI to confirm...It ain't cancer till the scan says so.",

You have an absolutley beautiful family. Amber, believe me they are not looking at you like your a burden or a lousy mom. They love you. Please do not quit your treatment until you have talked with your Onc. I do not understand what you are going through, I am on A.I's. So treatment is ok right now for me. But I do understand the way cancer changes our life's, it is unbelievable. Cancer is a M-f'er. . I still am getting used to the fact that everyday I wake up , I wake up thinking about \"the\" cancer.  I try and sometimes do suceed in making it go away..... I am so thankful for those times that its not monopolizing every single thought process in my mind, so yea it can be totally exhausting mentally. You have every right about feeling angry, bitter, and ornery.  I think that the Depression is a big part of breast cancer, it goes along with the territory. You are probably so tired with your treatment. Do hang in there, find out like the girls said in the posts up above if it is just an anti-depressant adjustment. Or if it is the treatment that has you so down. But know that I will be thinking and praying for you.",

Misquamicut has the best waves, beautiful bluish-green water. I couldn't go. There would be no place for me to rest during the course of the day. When my family goes there, it is for the entire day. 8 to 10 hours of full sun would kill me, where in my past I couldn't get enough. My sister just pestered me saying \"Oh, come on Re, you have to be kidding me, your going to need a nap?\" She doesn't get that I would love to go. She didn't see the tears. A good friend of mine actually gets pissed off when she calls at 7:00 p.m. and I am in for the night. She gets all nutty and will say \"Your really going to bed? Are you kidding me?\" They have no idea how hard it is for me. When they do pay attention and catch on, they get teary eyed. I don't want that. It's funny you were talking about the garden. This sunday I was determined to plant my garden. It took me a very long time, the 100 degree weather didn't help. I only got half of it in. The hubby only planted 2 tomato plant's yesterday and he has \"nothing \" wrong with him. So that should make me feel better. Plus halfway through planting, a friend called with alot of teenage/prom drama and I had to give her a ride. I could have continued yesterday. But I didn't. That's what is starting to bother me starting something and not finishing it. I totally get what you are talking about. I do have it good. But I think it is because I go with the flow and do what I can. I really want to start spinning, but I don't know if I have the stamina. PS. Thanks for posting this subject. This really is a topic that effects all of us. Is it lack of energy, stamina and endurance? Is it depression or pain?  That keeps you from doing these things? That would be interesting to know.",

I have never considered them so life altering as people with stage 1 or 2 do. But, after all with stage 4 do we really have a choice? I have been on it a total of 6 months.  For the first month and the half, all I got was ferocious flashes. Now I get them only when, I really exercise and once in the while I  will get spontaneous flashes. Going into the 2 month the joint pain (Rheumatoid Arthritis) and my myalgia kicked in hard. I felt like a 90 yr old trying to get up out of bed. (A feat in itself) Well that is starting to go away. I have some hair thinning and weak nails. I really hope my hair stops thinning. But I had my scans last month and my liver is CLEAN, My onc considers me in remission! So Femara is super strong. My TM's bob up and down, but have not gotten over 85 on my CEA. My ca 2729 is 8. So keep praying and be very proactive in your health care. I will continue to pray for you. Hugs!",

But we take what we can and apply it to our selves. I started my journey 2006, I went metz Oct 2008 with Liver & Bone. (4yrs 2 months) Now I am dealing with a little Brain blip. I truly feel its all how you decide to treat this. At this point I am still and will be treating it as a chronic disease. My choice, it's doable. I have a firm belief and faith in GOD (and thats not an apology) and know he heals me and comforts my fears. However you feel , remember this is a hard road, But it's doable.",

Stay home and do nothing? I am not trying to make you feel like poo-poo.  I recently was on the other side of this issue. The darling Hubby went to a bike rally for 4 days. (I do not really like them) I saw this as an opportunity to do what ever I liked. Which meant, spa day, all day. I had a Swedish message, manicure, pedicure and facial. I then spent the rest of the time at the casino. My hubby had the nerve to be pissed. Can you believe it? He spent all his time for the last few weeks planning his getaway, which by the way was cool with me, then he had the audacity to get pissed?!!!!! When he finally realized what a bitch he was being he apologized. He told me he would have liked to have gone. I suggested we still could go.  I trust my hubby a lot and would not take away his \"downtime\", but I also expect him to realize, I will take my down time too and will not sit at home and not do anything while he is having a good-time. I do however totally understand about a party being thrown in your home, while you are away. Totally disrespectful and not fair. Cause we know damn well that they will not respect your house, not like if you were there! Men have a tendency to trash the abode. At least he was decent enough to consider your feelings and postpone the party. I think I understand why you got upset with \"his\" plans. We still want 'Our\" plans. Thinking about this a second time, being stage four does take us off our game. Being totally truthful, I get scared sometimes, thinking about will he go on without me? It makes me misty, because I really do love him and don't want to have to think about things like that. Oh by the way did I tell you, I HATE CANCER! Well I hope I didn't piss you off  and by the end of my response...... I could definitly see your reasoning.",

My hubby ( who was my fiancee at the time) and I had just bought our new home. My Onc had insisted on me going on short term leave while going through chemo. My hubby could only go to the first couple of treatments because he was the only one bringing in a paycheck.  So my son Vinny stepped up to the plate and came to all my treatments and tests. He went through everything with me, the good the bad and the ugly. He saw things that a teenager shouldn't have to witness, but I was his mom and he wasn't going to let me go through this alone. His jokes, hugs, love, and compassion got me through some of the toughest times in my life. Because of this we have such a special bond. My Vinny is my rock. My oldest son David was totally devasted emotionally. He could not deal with my dx. He could not talk to me or look at me in the eye. He was terrified. He would distance himself from me to protect himself. Which was perfectly fine. No parent wants to put their children through all the pain and emotional terror that his disease brings. It kills us to see the terror in our childrens eyes. It hurts us knowing that our children are in fear of losing thier mom, when they should be thinking about going to college, partying with friends, traveling and just living life. Believe me, you being there for your mom spending time with her, laughing and crying means the world to her. You just being there is everything. This time around in my fight with the beast, my son David is completely different. He is constantly coming over , calling me, emailing me , asking me if there is anything he can do. Before he wouldn't even ask how treatment was, he would pretend I wasn't sick. Now he asks about test, treatment,etc...... He hugs me ( Hugs mean so much to me now ). I guess what I am trying to tell you is that, anything you can do for your mom or with your mom, will mean everything to her. The love you have for her will help her through this terrible journey, by knowing how much you love her and care for her. But at the same time live your life too, spending time with friends, have fun and good times. It is so important for you to have a life outside of the \"Cancer\". Believe me your mom wants this for you. God Bless Tender Hugs & Prayers",

Your mom's cancer would be considered Breast cancer met's to the Pleura. ( It will alway's be breast cancer). There is no proof that having a Mastectomy vs. Lumpectomy is any better when it come's to metastasis. Also cancer doesn't necessarily met's via the lymph node's. As I am living proof, I had absolutely no node involvement, so it spread through the blood. Also I had clear margin's, I personally think I was stage 4 from the get go, it was just not detected anywhere else. Petscan's do not start picking up cancerous cells with minimal disease present. It look's like your mom is Triple negative, it sometime's can be pretty aggressive. I think her Onc is Horrible (but that is my opinion) If she is Her2-, Herceptin would have been of no value to her. Mom can also be followed by CT scan or MRI. For some reason my onc prefer's Petscan/CTscan. I hope your mom get's relief from her current treatment and it's never to late for a second opinion",

Of course I am praying I get the Laptinib. Someone had said it was a win win situation no matter what, which is true. I am going to really try to cut all bad greasy foods out of my diet. I will try to really get a lot of Raw vegetables and fruits in my diet. I was exercising a lot, but backed off, because of winter aches and pains, anemia which literally knocked the breath out of me and a little depression. There are some food restrictions on the trial, grapefruit juice being a big no no. They told me there are a list of foods to avoid. I will let you know. I will be praying for you! Hugs!",

I was only doing a follow-up MRI on my kidneys and thats when they found the Liver Mets. I was Stage 1 er/pr pos her2 neg-.  I was bascically destroyed just like everyone else who hears crap like this. I was crippled with fear for the 1st week. I couldn't function, I went to get my pet-scan done & the next day I had a melt down on the phone with my Oncologist's assitant. I told her I was so sick & crippled with fear that I was practically picking out my coffin. The reason being I was on the stupid internet where they have us dead in 8 months. I was assured by her that they had many patients with liver mets living long lives and to stay of the internet! Jesus is the only thing getting me through this. I recieved my first lupron shot on Oct 31st and started femara on Nov 7th. Zometa will follow next months lupron shot. I hear good things about the femara from my oncologist. I am getting my treatment at Yale New Haven  & my doc is the director of the breast Center here, she came from Dana Farber , so God pretty much put her in my path. As we start our journey together, I give you lots of love & hugs and kisses and the power of prayer! Be well,  Renee \"By his stripes we are healed\"",
