On 8/9 through a lumpectomy with sentinel node removal, my surgeon removed 3 cancerous tumors but the path report is 4 pages and confusing - only one tumor size on �diagnosis� area which states �the tumor is multifocal ranging from 1.3 to 0.5 cm maximally�.

It may be a moot point for my decision but I am curious. The TNM on path reports pT1c, pN0(i-), pMX which I could state the tumors were beginning to invade and the node was negative.

It sounds like everyone wants me to decide today and proceed in a week with mastectomy or radiation and I feel resentful and emotionally fragile of this rushing more than the whole issue of the cancer. Heck, I still have staples and stitches and don�t like being sore. I have yet to cry which surprises me. I will be going to see a plastic surgeon today to talk about reconstruction at time of mastectomy � if I really decide to. Log in to post a reply",

Although my arm, discomfort, and tingling may not be lymphedema (is not according to my surgeon because I only had SNB) and LE Therapist says it is early stage & I may have something else going on w/my neck and shoulder, I want to be proactive since whatever it is, I do not like the feeling and as luck would have it, is bothering me more now. Is there special protocol for wearing sleeve during a flight? I don�t usually wear sleeve, only when inflammation is at it�s worst. TIA Log in to post a reply",

(boo hoo � did I really say that!?) . � Yes I said it and I mean it and now just have to get used to the facts of it. Like one doc said � it�s like Las Vegas gambling, you stack all the odds in your favor and a mastectomy would be stacking the odds of living in my favor. And life is the big prize. Two and a half weeks ago I wasn�t even contemplating such heavy matters. Anyway, I appreciate all of your pointers to the best locations to find material to read and although I�m gonna be working extra hard at work and home next week, I plan to be on these discussion boards learning from you experienced girls. Oh I am SO glad you are here for me. But also sad that you've had to take this journey. I�ll call my surgeons office Monday and tell them the �news� as soon as I get up enough nerve to decide to do an expander placement (left side) at same time. And will ask for at least two weeks so I can plan � although that will make the surgery fall within days of my only child�s 21st birthday. But she is at college anyway so�.. Well since I�ve turned to ramble, guess I should end this. BTW � I am glad to hear about the options of stitches over staples. I hated the staples from the lymph removal and was so glad to get those out on Thursday.",
