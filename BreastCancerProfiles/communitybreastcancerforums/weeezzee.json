I had a double Mast. and immediate reconstruction using the TUG procedure last July.  I needed help with four drains due to placement of surgery from the donor site (inner thigh's). I was in the hospital 3 days to monitor the new babes. I was fortunate pain was not a problem in the hospital or at home. Milking the drains is important to prevent blockage of the flow. I needed a record of the drainage for the doc. I prepared my sanctuary lots of pillows for support (a comfy mattress pad) cotton sheets, Bible, tv remote at the bedside. You need a caring person to block any well meaning person (loved ones included) visiting that would prevent you from feeling peaceful. (during a visit or phone converstation you feel tired or drained is a good sign to avoid) I enjoyed soups.  I avoided anyone that required me to help them deal!! We can love them AND take care of ourself. Reading Hymns helped. My aunt recovering from BC e mailed her favorite hymns. This is my first submit and I look forward to helping others cope. I have received so much information from this website. Thanks, God Bless",
