I'm at Stage IV, Her2+ (ER/PR -).  I was on Xeloda and an IV that was a trial (a # bu I can't remember what).  I was oriinally on 1500mg Xeloda 14 days + 1st day IV...I had so many side effects tht I was taken down to 1300 mg Xeloda.  My last PET/CT Scan showed that my cancer had not spread anyhere else other than the lung and locally to the chest wall (left side).  The local is usully treated by radiation but won't touch the metastasis in the lung.  The  local has eaten through my skin and I now have to wear a gauze to I don't ooze through to my shirt. They plan to start herceptin (trastumab) and HKI-272 an experimental drug.   I hope that my baseline MUGA test comes back above normal...if it works like before I won't stay on the Herceptin because the Her. affected my heart.  If this is one of the best available for Her2+ then what else is there if this fails? I've been afraid because I knew at Stage III, inflammatory, that it would come back but it is way too sooon for me. Thanks for the support .  I go to the University of Maryland in Baltimore--anyone know of others that I can seek out?  I've tried John Hopkins but never got call backs...so I figure their customer service must suck.
