I found some aloe Vera spray that is kept in the frig, and it feels so good to spray on that coolness. Maybe that would be helpful. (?) It really hurts to think about what you're going through. Faceforward, I too feel weird sensations along the sternum and I'm hopeful it's not hitting my esophagus ... I'm 9 treatments in & 16 to go, and feeling chest muscle tightness and some arm numbness around my elbow (weird), but so far my skin is holding up with the calendula cream & aloe Vera spray; aquphor at night. I can't sleep with this tissue expander ... it hurts all the time, and I wish everyday I'd just gone flat. This Radiation treatment stuff is so unpredictable - I am astounded by the range of side effects that are reported here. Good luck everyone. ",

I just want them to switch this TE out for an implant as soon as possible; then put all this in the rear view mirror! Good luck to all of you who are in that cold weather! Stay warm!!",

I, too, will be a radiation newbie; starting Jan 14th for 25 trmts. Has anyone had radiation with a tissue expander in place? I guess they will radiate the nodes in armpit, my chest wall and the supraclavicular nodes. Not sure how it will go with the TE in place. ",

Today I had some itchiness and the RO told me to mix the calendula with hydrocortisone cream- it worked - doesn\u2019t itch. Dani444- thanks - I have lump in my side, too; just below the drain site from the surgery - it\u2019s an annoying pulling sensatiion, too. Hoping it\u2019ll go away when done with rads. My PS said he won\u2019t switch out the TE for at least 4 months after rads (waiting for scar tissue to settle). Did you have the implant already? Did you have a TE? Mine is in front of the pectoral muscle. It\u2019s difficult to concentrate at work - I can relate to that. Just doing barely enough for crisis control- the rest can wait ! Good luck everyone! Take care! It was sure nice to have that 3day weekend- the radiation place was closed Monday! ",
