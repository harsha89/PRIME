I was told it was probably a cyst and scheduled for a mammogram and an ultrasound today. As the tech. was doing the ultrasound I told her it was probably a cyst and she Sid that it was not because it was a solid mass. I am now scheduled to see a surgeon tomorrow. I know about fibroadenomas but I have my image results and mine do not resemble many of the fibroadenoma images I have looked up. My results looked more asymmetrical than other images I have seen. Does anyone know if the surgeon will be able to tell me tomorrow if it is probably benign or possibly cancerous? Or will they always assume its benign until pathology?
