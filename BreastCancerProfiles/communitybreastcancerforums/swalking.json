I like your doctor's crystal ball reference.  I have to say, that is how I feel. My sister and I learned we are both BRCA1+ in January 2011. She had a SS/NS PBMX in June (at age 31) and I had mine in November of that year (at age 35). Our mother is a two-time BC survivor (age 29 and 45).  Her sister survived BC in her late 30s/early 40s but succumbed to OC about 10 years later. Their cousin died from BC in her mid 30s. So, every person in our family who has had the mutation has had BC by the time they reach their early 40s. Getting insurance coverage for the PBMX has been surprisingly smooth sailing (even now as I am in the process of revision surgeries), considering how difficult it was for me to get my MRIs and mammograms covered.  Every 6 months I had a struggle with them! Recovery was difficult but doable with pain meds and support ;) I took 6 weeks off of work (my sister only had 4).  I had no pain by the time I returned, but due to complications, I did have to return with an open wound from skin necrosis. That finally got resolved with a small procedure and strong antibiotics about 2 months after my surgery.   Best, Sarah",
