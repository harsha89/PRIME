If you're joining up, copy this whole thing and paste it into your message so we keep a running list.  Hope I didn't miss anybody! age 40, starting chemo probably first week of January: 4 AC/2 wks apart, 12 Taxol, 1 wk apart, clinical trial E5103 (80% chance I'll also get Avastin, 20% get placebo). More about me on myblog... ProudMom_Wife in California  Age 45, starting chemo January 5, Dose Dense AC (4x) then T (4x), all 2 weeks apart.   Tundra in Montreal, Canada Age 35, started chemo Dec 28th, (2010); Taxol: weekly for 12 weeks. Then on to AC... age 44, starting chemo January 18: 4 AC/2 wks apart, 4 TC/2weeks (neulasta 24 hours after the AC and TH) then weekly herceptin for the rest of the year. aimster1123 from MO age 42, starting chemo Jan 13:  TC 4x, 3 weeks apart.  But, it's my second time around with BC (and no, I don't have BRCA--just \"lucky\")--had it in 07, too, and had FAC 4x, 3 weeks apart.  So it's my second time losing hair and all that.  Ask me anything you want!   Many people call chemo \"doable\" but for me it was absolutely hideous, and my onc would agree.  I'm hoping this time will be better, but not expecting it.  I can give more details if you want them. :)",

All for now--I'll probably write more once chemo starts and I hit the bed. AmyA (aimster1123)    ",

      "Content": "Jan 3, 2011 09:13PM aimster1123 wrote: Just some thoughts on how to \"plan\" for when to have chemo, or what to anticipate being able to do or not do afterward. People say it all the time to the point that it sounds cliche, but it really is true--everybody is different and reacts differently.  I was a puking maniac, on a regimen that was supposed to be \"easy\"--other people refer to chemo as \"doable\" and \"not really all that bad.\"  Some people start feeling sick right away, for others it doesn't hit until 3-4 days after treatment and then WHAM!  So planning is really, really hard to do. I think it's fairly universal to say a few things, though.  1)  Most people on a 3-week cycle have the most trouble the first week after treatment, and then feel better and better til the next one.   2)  Most people find that the first treatment is the easiest one, and the second one is often harder.  After that, fatigue increases as you go, but usually ickiness tends to turn around on the same day.  I'm sure there are exceptions to both of these things, but this seems to be the general trend. So, that still makes it really hard to plan!  Vis, I'd say that Friday or Monday are your best bets.  If you want to be sure you can be at work on a Thursday, then do Friday.  But if you're really worried about the ER, you could wait til Monday.  Is your concern with the ER that it will be super-busy on the weekend?  Because with my clinic, you don't wait through the regular chattel at the ER--the onc always calls ahead (because you call them first) and tells them you're coming and to take you right in.  And I know the other major cancer center in town has a special floor that you go to for ER, instead of the regular one.  So if yours is like that, you wouldn't have to worry about waiting, should you need to go. MaryMeg, my instincts say that you very well COULD be up for singing (especially since this is your first treatment), and if you could do it it would be SO uplifting for you AND for everybody who hears you and knows what you're going through.  That said, I wouldn't plan to do it without the understanding that if you aren't up for it, you will cancel and they'll have to deal.  I would just talk to them about it and say that you REALLY want to do it, but you can't guarantee you'll be physically able.  Then maybe they'll also be up for letting you do it on a different week, when you know you'll be feeling good, like the Sunday BEFORE a treatment instead of the one right after. This is a huge journey that we're on, and chemo is a GIANT mountain in the midst of it.  There will probably be days when you feel like CRAP, and can't work, and the world will go right on spinning.  My advice is, take the time you need to care for yourSELF.  If ever there was a time when it can be OK to do that, it's now.  After this is all over, we can go back to being the ones who take meals to other people and work extra hours.  For now, we need to let others care for us, and slow down when we need to.  That's my little sermon!  And I'll need you to write it to me again when I try to push myself to go teach violin lessons when my body is telling me otherwise, OK?  Vis, we all know about being down!  Man, sometimes it just comes over you and you can't find a way out.  I've been there many times, with both dx, and it's so so hard.  The sun WILL shine again, but sometimes you have to wait for it to show up.  Just know that the ups and downs are totally normally, and don't beat yourself up for them.  Come and post here, and we'll do our best to lift you up. Last thought:  Waiting for scan results STINKS!  I have to say, any nurse who says you \"shouldn't be nervous\" has never been in our position.  That said, I was a whole lot less nervous my first time around with BC--I was too naive to realize the major ramifications of what the results would mean.  Now I'm a lot more \"experienced\" and scans FREAK me out.  I just brace myself until they're over, and pray and pray and pray for enough peace to get me through it.  That's about the best I can do! All for now, girls, AmyA (aimster1123) ",

Sounds like almost all of you are doing better than I am--if not, CALL YOUR ONC!!!!!  They WILL help you and you shouldn't hesitate to ask for it.  You're paying them well.  Over and out from yucko-land, Amy ",

I'm curious to hear everybody's shaving stories!  How you felt afterwards, especially.  The anticipation was SO much worse than the event last time.  Oh yeah, I got a \"twiggy\" cut on Friday and I love it.  Too bad I won't have it for more than a week or so. :(  I'm pretty well stocked with scarves and hats and wigs, so I guess I'm ready.

JulieH, yes, the F was Flourouracil (sp?).  My onc really doesn\u2019t know if it will be as bad, the same, or worse than last time, but he\u2019s already planning to put me on an anti-emetic pump immediately after treatment.  That\u2019s what I had to do last time if I didn\u2019t want to end up in the ER with massive throwing up troubles.  I also had to take Marinol (synth marijuana) last time which I HATED, so I\u2019m really hoping I might not have to take that this time.  YES, my port has been pretty sore both times, but I got mine two weeks ago and I don\u2019t even notice it at all now. Karen,  sounds like we\u2019re on the same chemo regime\u2014TCx4, 3 weeks apart.  And both on our second dx, too\u2014probably no coincidence!  Did you say when you start?  1/13 for me.  I agree with most of you that the port procedure isn\u2019t too bad, in the grand scheme of things.  And it\u2019s SO nice to have it.  Last time I ended up having so many more IV\u2019s than I would have expected, and it was never a big deal.  Just stick it in and you\u2019re good to go. Warriorprincess, SO sorry you\u2019re having to go through this at ANY age, but especially so young.  You are brave and awesome.  You\u2019ve probably already thought about having the genetic testing done, but plenty of time for that after treatment is over.  You are in such a great place being at home, and you will get through this a little at a time.  When you come out the other side, you will have learned and matured and grown SO MUCH.   AmyK, I read some of your blog pages\u2014you and I have a fair bit in common, besides just our names.  I too have a LONG infertility story (our 2 kids are adopted from Russia) and am an exercise fanatic (hope you don\u2019t mind being grouped with me in that!).  I teach BodyPump (weightlifting class) and was in the process of getting certified in BodyStep (athletic step aerobics class) when my 2nd dx came up.  I\u2019m an artist, too, but in the form of a violinist, not a writer or graphic designer, though. :) A little more about me:  in March 07 at age 38 I was diagnosed with IDC, stage 1, neg nodes, 1.1 cm tumor.  I had lumpectomy, chemo (FACx6) and rads, and took Tamoxifen until my recent dx.  This time I was dx\u2019d in early November, after my onc found a lump at my regular exam.  I had bilateral mx with TE\u2019s on November 18, 6mm tumor and one positive node.  I\u2019ll be starting chemo on 1/13 as you know, CTx4, 3 weeks apart.  After that they\u2019ll give me shots to put me in menopause, and most likely I\u2019ll ultimately have a full hysterectomy to make menopause a permanent thing.  And of course I still have to have reconstruction.  My onc says that my body probably doesn\u2019t metabolize Tamoxifen, since this cancer was er/pr + (as was the last one).  It really shouldn\u2019t have been growing at all, but it was.  My onc  said my chances of recurrence were 3-4%.  I don\u2019t have BRCA\u2014had that test done a couple of years ago\u2014I\u2019m just lucky. :) All for now, AmyA (aimster1123)",

By the way, I'm on TC, no A.  Last time I had FEC, so no A then either, but the Cytoxan definitely did a number on me.  I think I might be attributing the low-point of this day 5 to the Taxotere, which I've never had before.  A lot of people say that they get a delayed reaction to that drug, and for me last time things always got steadily better after the initial yuck.  This time seems to be much more up-and-down, so that's my theory as to why for the moment.  So glad to have you ladies to slog through this with.

By the way, Ativan is a beautiful drug, IMO!  Helps with nausea and anxiety, and helps you sleep. Which is what I need to do right now!  ;) Love to you all, Amy   That said, I think I'm starting to get a taste of the Taxotere joint pain.  Suddenly today, my hips are really, really sore.  It's not a muscle pain, it feels like it's IN the bones.  Very bizarre, and actually fairly painful.  But honestly, I'll take it over the nausea I've had the last week any day.  At least, I say that now, LOL!  I'm definitely in better spirits today, after this upturn, and an amazing, beautiful time with God this morning.   ",

Mine is adjuvant--had lumpectomy with neg nodes, pr/er+, her2 neg. My onc thought about TC, but since I'm a professional violinist, we decided to avoid the neuropathy. I had 2 opinions from oncs, and the other one would only offer me FEC through a clinical trial, saying that it had not been tested enough, in his opinion. But the other onc is a more forward-thinking Dr., IMO, and FEC was his idea after spending a weekend \"agonizing\" (his word) over which treatment to give me. So hopefully it's the best option! I think it is, or I wouldn't have trusted him with my care. How soon did you lose hair with FEC, anyone? What about other side effects? Just trying to get a handle on what this is gonna be like!

My understanding from the one onc that didn't want to give me FEC, was that it hasn't been tested enough in the US to have become a mainstream option here. I guess they're cagey about taking on a new primary treatment?",
