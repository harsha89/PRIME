Got the call on Wednesday that I needed to come back in for another look, did so Friday, for calcifications on my right breast near the nipple. Now I need to have stereotatic biopsy on Aug 1. I am in shock more than anything- I have no family history of cancer. It was just totally unexpected and now I'm so anxious. I'm going out of town tomorrow for a week (dropping my older kids at sleepaway camp and then going with my husband and youngest on a long weekend) and they couldn't get me in today or tomorrow morning so I have to wait until I get back. Which is probably for the best with the recovery and travel but now I am spending so much time thinking about the what if's. Also my MIL is currently in treatment for BC so it would be a blow if I am also diagnosed with something. If I have the biopsy and am then diagnosed, do I then just call my preferred specialist? I have already found 2 names that I would like to consult with, one is at a large breast center (NCI) and the other is at my local hospital (though both are local to me). Do I just call them up and ask for an appointment? Is there a long wait if you've just been diagnosed? I'm a teacher and so stressed about the impact this may have on my job security as I am not full-time so do not qualify for FMLA and carry my family's health insurance. I'm also stressed about the biopsy. I am not terribly squeamish/needle averse, have had 2 kids without pain meds and no problem giving blood or getting shots. I have never taken xanax or anything so I said it wasn't needed. I will likely need to drive myself to/from the biopsy and they said it was fine to do so because my husband will be home with my younger child. Just nervous/anxious/worried, and trying to keep it together. Log in to post a reply",
