Right now I am waiting to see my regular doctor about pain running through my breast up into my nipple area. Also I have found several lumps in my breast and my left nipple is turning inward some what. I finally called my gynos office and told them I would not be back. I found out that two years ago at my last mammagrame that had wanted me to have further testing done but she choose not to do it. It is now two years later and I am having even more sytoms then before. My regular doctor said that he will make sure that what ever needs to be done gets done. My mother lost both breast to cancer in her forties. Recently I have an aunt on my father's side of the family diagnosed with breast cancer so there is a family history. Also my mother has colon cancer now and she just informed me yesterday that one of her kidney is shutting down. I am a mess over hearing this. Thank you for listening.

I tried asking questions like if they could tell me what my birads are etc. The only thing that they could tell me were that they are two areas of concern and that's why extra test were ordered. Now I have to wait till next week when my doctor is in to get the test finial results. It's weird because usually they told me right away that everything was ok are not but this time wouldn't go into much information but I am at a new place also guess every place is different. Anyone else had these test done and how long before you got your results back? Thank you for listening. Deannie Deannie Log in to post a reply",

She told me that if she was me to ask for sure what they thought it was and not be afraid to ask the hard questions. Hers started out like mine as they say I have back to back clusters in my left breast also but it took them back then a long time to find her cancer so for peace of mind I just want to know for sure what's going on because they keep saying each time sinficant changes in the left breast. This time I am insisting on a biopsy for my own peace of mind. Thanks Deannie",
