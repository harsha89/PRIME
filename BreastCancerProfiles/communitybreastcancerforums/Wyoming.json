I started Xeloda a month ago with Avastin and Taxotere Numbers went up so now I'm upping my dose of Xeloda and not doing anything else, I will find out at the end of the month is it is doing any good. Most likely my last treatment. I stay very positive. I have two grand babies who are 2 1/2 and 2 so I have to stay around for them. I find talking to family is the hardest. Thank God for these forums. I hope I didn't depress anyone but wanted to let you know that I understand the feeling but I'm going to live every day to the fullest and be as positive and happy as I can. Wyoming",

In March found out that my cancer had met to lungs and liver. I started Gemzar, Carboplatin and Avastin in March. My schedule was 2x every 3 weeks. My tumor markers are now in the normal range to be considered in remission. I now get to spread my txt out to once every 3 weeks and then once every 4 weeks. As to the SE's of this regiment - very little. I have bloody noses and it runs all the time.  I have my txt on Friday and Sunday I'm tired. I have continued to work. Hope this helped. Wyoming",

I had the traditional with Adriamycin, cytoxan and Taxotere. I had it once every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Every thing went well I lucked out and didn't have too many side effects after the first dose. I then had radiation for five days a week for 8 weeks.Then in March 09 my cancer met to the liver and lungs. I'm now on Avastin, carboplatin, gymzar. I started with twice every three weeks. I'm now down to once every 4 weeks. Very few side effects and am in chemical remission. I say do research on this sight and mayo to help with your decision. I would also look at which team of doctors do you trust most. Also get involved in a discussion group, they help because they have gone through the experience same as you. Hope this helped. Wyoming",

I did the gemzar and carbo until Dec. markers started going up. Went on Doxil and Abraczane(sp) but couldn't handle the side effects of mouth sores and rash. I started Xeloda and Taxotere but numbers continued to climb. We upped my Xeloda and not doing the Taxotere. Will find out how things are going at the end of the month. My Onc is looking into compassionate care with the PARP. I feel great so it hard for me to think that I have cancer and feel so good. I know you don't know me but please keep your fingers crossed for me. Vicky",
