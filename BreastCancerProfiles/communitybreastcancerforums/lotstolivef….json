I think I'll make it..........",

Margins clear.  My breast cancer is on my right breast, so perhaps my heart is not in danger?  I didn't have chemo because my oncotype dx came back score of 12.  I'm worried about pulmonary side effects.  It really has me wanting to jump ship before I even get on!",

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2010 11:56PM - edited Feb 12, 2010 12:00AM by lotstolivefor Good morning icey! I've had 9 treatments so far on my right breast, and I'm almost a pest when it comes to asking my techs a million questions--including the ones you're asking!  First off, your entire breast will likely be radiated because they don't want to miss any stray cancer cells that might be lurking.  This does mean that the radiation field will go right up to the chest wall a bit, because there is breast tissue there.  This also means that some radiation will 'skim' a small portion of your lung.  I know that sounds scary!  I've been reassured dozens of times, though, that it's a very small amount, and there are typically no side effects from it.  It amounts to between 1-3 cm of lung exposed. I did lots of research about it, and I encourage you to do the same--knowledge is power!  And knowledge helps you feel less anxious. Second, they don't cover anywhere else on your body--and I did ask them this very question last week!  The radiation is precise enough so that they don't need to do that, and they don't want such material (like a lead apron, for example) to interfere with the area that needs to be treated. As far as being tired, it might be a bit early for me to comment on this, but so far so good!  The daily commute to treatment tires me a bit, but I'm feeling very good otherwise. Good luck with your treatment! Editing to add: I just saw that you and I have very similar diagnosis--and we were diagnosed a day apart!  Just thought that was interesting.....I'm assuming you didn't need chemo?  ",
