He is scared about my situation and confused and looking for answers. I am so blessed to have him and his concern. U are cruel and ignorant to even mention that. No one needs your post on this site if this is your only concern.",

My son Wayland was unaware of the age regulations of this site when he posted and as well he should be because why would anybody so scared and concerned determine such a thing prior to posting their upmost insecurities! It is my intention to make it clear that my oldest son, Wayland and my youngest were not meant to see this site on our home computer as they went on for homeschool curriculum. I neglected to delete it and it has been my biggest fear since that they are worried about a breast cancer diagnosis and as such we have discussed it at great length. They are both well versed in medical education and I have always been open and honest with them concerning these matters in relation to age appropriateness. As a result, they both feel better in the last 24 hours but at no thanks to insensitive and uncaring people like yourselves. This is a forum for people to discuss their fears and concerns and possible options for treatment and recovery, not one to reprimand and parent another person's child. We understand the rules now and will not be visiting the site again. Their grandfather, a MD, for 53 years in our local community, their father-age 52, and their great grandmother have all passed within the last year and 2 months. It is no wonder my oldest, Wayland visited this site for some answers only to be met with heartache by people like you. How dare you! I am a registered nurse, but being the remarkable child he is, Wayland thought I was sheltering him from worry. He came to this site as an avenue for hope! It was so genuinely nice of you both to point out his mistakes for visiting this site and diminish my parenting skills to him. How wonderful you both are for for making him feel lost in such a time of need. I am grateful to you both for one thing, you solidify my belief that people are inherently selfish and choose not to help those in need when it benefits them! I sincerely do thank the ones that provided support for my child in his hour of need ie. OBSOLETE. You are what this site is about.",
