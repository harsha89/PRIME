They have already told me I am to have 2-4 mo of chemo, 1-2 mo of rads. Because of this and the fact they will do a modified radical on my left, the PS said that the best result would be a mound from my back. But they could do great on my right. As of this point I am thinking forget about the reconstruction and focus on the mastectomy and getting through the rest of the treatments. Hate to be on this site, but so glad you are here.
