That is an un-heard of statistic, and , we Survivors / Caregivers need to remind all \" Investigators \" , FDA staff, etc. , that each of the 38 % is a person ! A drug that all leading  BC Research Oncologists assumed would be approved.  But they ran into  a  \" New \" FDA  plan to change the rules of accelerated approval, to show Big Pharma that Big Govt. was the boss , going to revoke a drug that was one of the few options for TNBC ( Avastin ). Going to punish co's for not completing trials after previous early approvals ( Thats not OUR problem , dont punish us ! ).  This FDA ( post 2008 ) has uni-laterally decided to further extend trials , forcing OS stats instead of the previous PFS standard measurement.Slowing down approval, 20th century bureaucrats / regs forced on the development of 21st century drugs. This drug is the first of its kind in history, and , yes , it did get swept up in the Avastin issue. Anyone who thinks these FDA  oncology drug reviewers are in-fallible, and above making human errors is fooling themselves.  Only \" FDA \" True Believers \" , and lock-step apologists believe that . Anyone who looks at Lorraine on youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlsrTqWUL6g ) can see the Living Proof !  Why was lapatinib ( Tykerb ) granted accelerated approval in 2007  ? And not T DM-1 in 2010 ? Politics, bureaucrats taking advantage of Presidential Admin. changes in power.  Tykerb is clearly inferior to T DM-1 in terms of efficacy, and  T DM-1 is way better in terms of s/e. Lets give the Stage IV Pts a real Voice in this process. I guarantee you there will be Less Politics , and More Lives Saved !  ",
