So if anyone has any advice or info that will help me plan for this I would be grateful.  I have decided not to have any reconstruction so if anyone can help with info about bras and prosthetic boobs that would be great.

I know in the UK they do not give you copies of your reports, you would need to apply to your area health board and request access to your records and then you would be able to have a copy of the report but all that would take months to get.  I am not sure how open they are in Russia with medical records.

I used to be a 42 DD but I have decided to be a 42 B+ my fitter was very helpful and took time to explain everything to me, I took my Mom with me so she could tell me what she thought obout how things looked as I tried on diffrent bras and prosthetics.  I left wearing my new prosthetics and a lovely lacy bra and carrying the 4 other bras I had picked. My range of motion is almost back to normal in both arms, my scar on the left side has totally healed and all the scabs have fallen off but on my right side the wound still weeps in two spots that are taking longer to heal.  I am hoping it will be healed soon.  I found that doing my exercises in the shower help me with getting everything moving again. My skin all around my chest area is hyper sensitive and I dont know how long that will last but I am very lucky that I have had no pain since the day of surgery. I hope all of you still dealing with pain find relief soon. ",

She got very upset and said that it not right for a child to die before a parent and she want to spend every minute she can with me. I explained to her that people can live for a long tome with stage IV and that I don't think I am ready to die anytime soon. I explained why I want to continue to work but she can't see that all of the family treat me differently now, she thinks I am trying to hide the truth about my situation. I was able to show her the posts on here and she was able to see that maybe just maybe she had selfish reasons for wanting me to stay home. I just gotta love my Mom, she is stronger than I will ever be. Thank you all for your thoughts on this, it has helped me focus on what's real and not stick my head in the sands or cruise on the river of de-Nile.. Hugs Kezzie",

She was hit by a teen driver who was texting while driving and has been left unable to walk or do much for herself.  She applied for SSDI 2 months after her accident and while she was on STD from her job.  She was approved within 3 months and has just started getting her payments last month. She has to wait 24 months from her approval date to get Medicare and she has been told that if she does anywork that has income of more than 1k a month she has to notify SSA.  They never asked about how much she was earning prior to her acident or how much she was getting in STD/LTD. I would advise anyone who is thinking of applying for SSDI to check out there situation with the SSA before you apply.  There are also loads of lawyers who will help you get SSDI and they charge a % of any back dated money you get.
