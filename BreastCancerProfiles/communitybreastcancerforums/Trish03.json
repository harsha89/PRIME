A great majority of ILC tumors are ER+ and Her2-. Although my original bc was Her2-, the biopsy on the tumor in my liver showed that my mets are Her2+ and still ILC. Since this is really rare, I'l interested in finding others with the same dx.  Mods, thanks for the link; however, my bc isn't mixed type since it's just ILC. Kathy, thanks for your response. It's nice to know that someone else also has ILC and Her2+. I don't think there are many of us around. It's interesting that we're on different drugs except for the Herceptin. I hope your treatments go well on Monday. Hugs, Trish",

I just had my 6th treatment, and I'm hoping that my next scans in 2 weeks show similar results. You'll feel much better after you get your treatment established because you'll feel more in control of the situation. I know how scary it is to hear those words. I am very encouraged to hear from the ladies who have been living with liver mets for many years. I love hearing from them! All the best to you. Hugs, Trish",

Denise, welcome to the Kadcyla group. I'm amazed that you've been Stage IV for 12 years. That's truly remarkable!. Do you still have any liver mets or just the lymph nodes behind the sternum. I was dx with liver mets at the end of May, so you are truly an inspiration! I don't have any experience with Faslodex, but Kadcyla seems to be easy so far. All the best to you. Trish",

I also had Benedryl first, so that took a little time. It's definitely different from the many hours with THP. I'm a little concerned because today I got the results of my liver panel that was done yesterday. It showed that some of my liver enzymes are elevated compared to 3 weeks ago. AST was 35 (up 13); ALT was 34 (up 10); Alkaline Phos was 123 (up 2). Bilirubin was the same 0.3. Although only 2 of them are above the normal range, I'm very worried about the trend. I'm afraid that this means that Kadcyla is not working as it should. My onc doesn't do tm's, so this is the only indicator I have between scans. My next scans will be two weeks after my next treatment,  a total of 5 weeks. That's a long time to worry. I really want this drug to work because the se's seem very mild so far. I feel tired, and my back hurts sometimes, but that's all. Has anyone else had elevated liver enzymes when the drug was actually working? I guess I'm looking for something positive so I don't automatically assume the worst. Hugs, Trish",

I had a similar experience (not the bone mets), but when I was on PHT, my tumors in my liver shrank dramatically - almost 80% total. I went off Taxotere after 6 cycles, and I started having small progression, so I think the Taxotere was the drug that was really effective for me. Now I'm on Kadcyla. I've had 2 cycles of it and will have scans in 2-3 weeks. I'm really hope it's working because, for me, it's a very easy chemo with few side effects. My hair is growing like crazy, and I don't have the terrible D that I had on Perjeta. I have a little fatigue but nothing like when I was on Taxotere. I haven't had any nausea at all. Petjunkie, I love reading your story! A year stable is wonderful! I hope it continues for a long, long time. All the best to everyone. Hugs, Trish",

He's going to load me up with pre-meds next time and also told me to take the dexa that I took with Taxotere. Surely, all of that will proven another reaction. In reading all of these posts, I can see that the se's are all over the map. I'm very fortunate - so far - that I haven't had nausea, headache, and pain, except for occasional lower back pain. I do have fatigue, some days worse than others. I hope that all of us continue to see good results from Kadcyla. I'm very encouraged by those of you who have been on it for several months.",

I know that's listed as a se of Kadcyla, and I wonder how many of you have experienced that yet have remained stable. My lab work from yesterday (prior to my 6th treatment) shows an increase in AST from 41 to 60; Bilirubin from .3 to .6; ALT from 33 to 63; and Alkaline phosphatase from 90 to 128. I don't have scans for 2 more weeks. My scan after the 3rd treatment showed the tumors had shrunk. I was so hoping that would be the case this time. I recently started talking Catflam for lower back pain, and the se's list elevated AST and ALT but don't mention the others enzyme tests. I think I read somewhere that someone had to go off Kadcyla because her liver enzymes went so high, although the cancer was still stable. Does anyone know anything about that?  I'm a little freaked out because a rise in my liver enzymes usually mean progression for me. That happened with PHT when we dropped the taxotere.  I know this post wanders all over the place. I mainly want to know if anyone has had a rise in liver enzymes yet Kadcyla was still working. I really don't want to have to change to another drug because this on is so easy for me. Hugs, Trish",

I know that Kadcyla can mess with liver enzymes, but I don't know how much or what that means as far as treatment. I just hope this rise is caused by the drug and not by progression as it was when I was on PHT and saw a rise after dropping Taxotere.  I'd really love to continue with Kadcyla because it has been so easy for me...almost no side effects. As I've mentioned before, I have lower back pain, but the Cataflam has helped a lot with that. I just passed my one-year mark with mets, and I think It's starting to sink in that this is for forever. My life is going to be a constant roller coaster. I'm actually looking forward to my scans on June 12. I want to know what's happening with my liver. All the best to everyone. Hugs, Trish",

That's really encouraging to hear. I hope your next scans show positive results, too. You are definitely a Kadcyla success story for the rest of us. I don't ever expect to be NED, either. I would be totally shocked. Diane, I hope your se's continue to be mild and that you don't develop mouth sores. I don't know if that's a common se of this drug or not. I don't recall hearing about anyone having them. I have an update: A few days ago I wrote that my tumors are stable but my liver enzymes were rising. The onc felt that the rise was caused by the drug since the tumors are stable. When I saw my onc last week for treatment, he said he wanted me to come back in a week to have my blood checked again to see it there's a trend. I was shocked that this week my liver enzymes went down dramatically!!!! I can't imagine why, but I'm thrilled. I asked my onc last week if, since my tumors are stable, they might start to shrink again, and he said no. I hope he was wrong and this drop is cause by a reduction in tumor size. It gives me cause to hope. I'm thankful for stable, but I would love to get to NED on this drug. All the best to everyone. Hugs, Trish",

I appear to be responding well after 3 cycles of Kadcyla. Liver numbers yesterday were all down a little and all were in the normal range. I have scans coming up next Monday which will tell the whole story. I hope and pray this drug is working. It's easy as far as se's. I'd love to stay on it forever!  I've already failed Perjeta and Herceptin after the Taxotere was removed from the cocktail. That's a scary feeling when you start checking drugs off the list.

I haven't had any nausea or dry mouth. The main thing I've noticed is that I feel tired a lot. It's definitely not as bad as the fatigue I had with Taxotere, thank goodness. I also have pain in my lower back if I'm on my feet very long. I'll be curious to see if these se's last the entire cycle. The best change is that I don't have the diarrhea I had while on Perjeta. Woo Hoo!!!! LuAnn, I'm sorry to hear about your dehydration and having to go to the hospital. I hope that was a one-time event for you. I'm trying to drink lots of water so I don't have that problem. Since I haven't had any nausea, maybe it won't be an issue. I hope you can get some relief from the nausea. It's strange how some people get certain se's and some don't. Chicago girl, I've also had a runny nose...didn't make the connection, but it makes sense. it's awesome that you've had stable scans while on Kadycla! I hope you are able to remain on it for a very long time. I have to go Tuesday for bloodwork to see if my platelets are OK. I really hope everything's fine because I'd hate to have to start going every week for bloodwork as I did on Taxotere. If my count are OK, then I won't have to go every week. So far I really like this drug compared to PHT. I just hope and pray that it'll control the cancer so I can stay on it for a long time. Hugs, Trish",

I hope you continue to do well on Kadcyla. Texasrose, I don't think my 1st infusion was larger, but it did last longer because they had to give the infusion more slowly and watch me for reactions. I haven't had any fever or nausea as many have; my main se's are feeling really tired and lower back pain when I stand up very long. It's been a week today since my treatment, and I think the tiredness is finally getting better. Sure hope so! I'm really hoping this drug works. I have bloodwork tomorrow, so I'll find out if it knocks my platelets down. If it does, I'm not sure what they'll do about it. I wish all the best for everyone. I hope we can all have a long ride on this treatment because it does seem to be easier than most. Hugs, Trish",

I think stable is definitely something to celebrate! It sounds as though your experience with PHT was the same as mine. I did great on the 3 drugs...significant shrinkage each scan. Then after dropping Taxotere, the progression started. Even though it was small, my onc thought it would be better to change to the Kadcyla.  I agree; it was a blessing in disguise. The diarrhea with P was terrible; it pretty much controlled my life. Even though I've been off the P for two weeks, I've had a couple of episodes. I hope it just means that the P isn't totally out of my body yet.  I hope that your scans tomorrow give you a good report. Please let me know how it goes. I'm really hoping this drugs works because I don't know what would come next. My onc said something about going back on Taxotere or trying Kadcyla. He decided on the Kadycle, so I don't know if that means Taxotere is next. I see you're ER+, too. Are you taking anything for the ER+ component? It concerns me some that I'm not, since my tumor was greater than 95%+ for estrogen.  Hugs, Trish",

For the first year, I didn't really think about recon...too busy with chemo, rads, which was all I could handle at that time. After a while, though, after life seemed to be getting back to normal, I started thinking about recon and started doing lots of research. Also, at some point, I saw a plastic surgery show on TV where a bc survivor got recon and could wear regular bras and clothes. I think that made me really start thinking seriously about the possibilities, this was something I could actually do myself. After much research, I decided that I did not want implants because of the high failure rate following rads, I decided that DIEP was the procedure that would work best for me; then I researched doctors until I decided where I wanted to get my surgery. Since no one in my area does DIEP, I had to travel for my surgery. I'm so thankful that I did because it's a one-shot deal. I wanted to make sure that I chose a doctor with a lot experience doing the procedure that I wanted. I had absolutely no complications with the surgery or the healing. I'm been thrilled with my new breasts. They feel exactly like my real ones...soft, warm. The radiated skin doesn't feel or look any different from the other skin. The surgeons don't have to stretch the radiated skin because when the flap is attached, it adds skin where the original breast was removed. I can wear any clothing I want and actually have cleavage, which I didn't ever have. I wouldn't even have to wear a bra if I don't want. It's nice at my age, now 62, to have perky breasts. Being stage 3 didn't affect my decision at all. I certainly know all the stats, but I've always had a positive outlook. It has now been almost 4 years since my surgery, and I've never regretted having it. It's a huge decision which requires much consideration. Everyone is different, and no procedure is right for everyone. You ladies are doing the right thing in asking many questions and weighing many possibilities. You'll know when you find the right answer; you will feel confident in your decision.  All the best to everyone, Trish",

My onc has said that after 6 he may take me off the Taxotere. Although I really want to be off that drug, I'm also nervous about it. It seems as though so many people had progression when only on P/H. I wonder if anyone has done well for very long on just the two drugs. My onc has also mentioned Kadcyla for future use if needed. How do the side effects compare to those with P/H/T? It's good to have contact with someone else with liver mets. Hugs, Trish",

I know that I don't stress over small stuff as much as many other people do or as much as I did in the past. I'm constantly aware that I've been very fortunate. I wish the best to all of my Stage III sisters who are going through treatment right now. It will end, and you will get your life back. You will get to the point where you don't think about bc all the time. I also wish the best to those who are celebrating anniversaries as I am.

I like the idea that it means the cancer is dying and the nerves in the liver are responding. I seem to notice it more since I've had my 3 cycles of Kadcyla, so I hope that proves to be true. My scans Monday will tell the whole story. It's certainly not unbearable. It tightens up in a certain spot (not always the same place) forming a knot I can feel, then relaxes after a few seconds. It feels just like a muscle spasm. I don't even know if the liver has muscles!  Hugs, Trish",

I really feel like the odd-one out! I've often wondered if being ILC affects my treatment with Her2 targeted drugs. On my first treatment, I had a great response on PHT, but when we dropped the Taxotere after 6 cycles, I had progression when on Perjeta and Herceptin only. Now, I've been on Kadcyla since February, and my scans have been stable...never any regression; however, my bloodwork last week showed my liver enzymes have shot up higher than ever. I'm going in tomorrow for repeat bloodwork. I'm afraid this means a new treatment, and I have no idea what will come next. I'm also concerned that I don't take anything for the ER/PR+ part. I've asked my onc, and he doesn't want to give me an AI's along with chemo. Kadcyla contains a chemo bonded to Herceptin. He allowed me to take Aromisin after I dropped Taxotere, but that was only for a short time since I had progression on the P & H. Is anyone taking both chemo and and AI? When I was dx Stage IIIa in 2003, I was ER/PR+ and Her2-neg. When the cancer came back in my liver last year, it was still strongly ER+ (greater than 90%), PR+, and Her2+. My onc said at the time that this was the best possible pathology report I could get, I guess because of the new Her2 drugs. I've asked him if its being ILC makes a difference, but he gave me a vague answer. In the study, I wonder if they even look at the response differences of ILC and IDC...probably not.",

After 5 weeks on Xeloda, my liver enzymes jumped up this week for some reason. Onc said it could be a blockage, and I might need a stent. Luckily, I have scans coming up on Monday. Have any of you had to have a stent, and, if so, what's it like? I'm not having any pain, just some queasiness and diarrhea. I have no appetite. I'm hoping that maybe a dose reduction might help. I'm taking Zeloda, ONT-380, and Herceptin as part of a clinical trial. Any info about blockages or stents would be greatly appreciated. This is new territory for me. Hugs, Trish",

I am happy to see how many of you are doing well, and I pray daily for those who are struggling. My question is about Gemzar/gemcitabine. It looks as though I'll be starting it Monday as I've had a little progression in my liver mets while on Navelbine. I'd like to know how long you were on it and what results you had. Also, what were your side effects? I need to decide by Monday whether I want to do the Gemzar or go on a clinical trial that my onc has found. For an update: I don't think I've posted much since I was on Kadcyla. I went from there to a clinical trial with ONT-380, Xeloda, and Herceptin. I was having good results but developed severe h/f syndrome and had to come off the trial. I then went on Navelbine. When I was going through the preliminary testing for the trial, I found out I had a small brain met. I had TruBeam radiation (similar to Cyberknife) for that. I also had radiation for a small tumor in the paraspinal musculature (muscles that are parallel to spine). All the best to everyone. Trish",

I've now been on Arimidex 4.5 years. I had a mast. on the \"good\" side when I had recon (my choice for peace of mind). Yes, amazingly, chemo is a distant memory. I don't think of it unless something reminds me. When I comb my hair, I don't think of the time when I was bald. I do remember during treatment when I wondered if I would ever be able to put it behind me, but somehow it just happened. Thanks to all of you for your kind comments.

We must be a really small group, but I'm happy to have found the two of you who are on Kadcyla. Brooklyn, I'm thrilled to hear that you've been on the drug for a year and that the se's are manageable. It seems that fatigue and a little nausea are fairly common for about 3 days after treatment; I think I can deal with that. It's wonderful that you got to NED on this drug. That really gives me reason for hope. I read about one lady who had to stop the treatment because of bad neuropathy in her feet and legs, so I'm glad to hear that hasn't been a problem for you. If you're able to run after a four and a six year old, then you must be doing really well. You don't know how great that makes me feel!! I hope you upcoming scans are good for you and that you continue the have success on Kadcyla. petjunkie, it's great news that you've also been on the drug for almost a year now and that you feel normal most of the time. That's really encouraging information for a Kadcyla newby like me. Do you take anything for the hot flashes? I started taking Zoloft several years ago, and it works very well, even for the 9 years I was on Arimidex. I'm sorry to hear that you got a brain met but very happy that the gamma knife got rid of it. I'm glad that the mets in your bone and liver remain stable. My only mets are in my liver, and I hope Kadcyla zaps them. I already take potassium because mine is low due to the terrible diarrhea I've had on Perjeta. I'm looking forward to getting rid if that problem. I wonder how long it will take for the Perjeta side effects to get out of my system. Thanks again for the information. Maybe there are some more Kadcyla/TDM1 ladies out there who will chime in with their own experiences. It's always comforting to talk to others in the same situation. Hugs, Trish",

Face is still a little red and swollen, but that could be from the dexa they told me to take. It always made my face flushed when I took it with Taxotere. On Monday I did go into the onc's office. May blood pressure was high but other vitals were ok. They they made me an appointment to see my onc for next Tues. He's out of town right now. Luckily, the headache never came back; they was definitely the worst part. Denny, the stomach pains must have been very scary. Was  it soon after a chemo treatment? Did you contact your onc? I certainly hope that doesn't happen again. I'm sorry that your pain meds didn't help. KasSha, thanks for sharing the good experience you've had on Kadycle. That's very encouraging to the rest of us. I'm especially happy to hear of the good effect it has had on your liver since that's where I have mets. Have you had mets for 18 years? I'd love to hear about that. Hugs, Trish",

I'm doing really well with very few side effects; however, one side effect really gives me problems, and I'm wondering if anyone else is bothered with the same thing. When I stand up or walk for just a few minutes, I get really bad lower back pain. I don't really think it's bone mets because the second I sit down the pain stops. The pain feels like I've had in the past when I lifted really heavy boxes and strained my back. It's is becoming a real problem when I need to go shopping or anywhere where I need to walk around for very long.  Has anyone else had this problem while on Kadcyla? I've taken Tramadol and Aleve but can't really tell that it helps much. I don't really want to take narcotics for this since it only hurts when I walk. If you've had this issue, I'd appreciate knowing how you deal with it or if you can offer any advice. We're going to Disney next week, and I've rented a scooter for the entire week. There's no way I would be able to last more than 10-15 minutes without it. Thanks, Trish",

I will have my 2nd treatment on Monday. I don't know yet whether it's getting rid of the tumors, but I do know that my liver enzymes are lower. I've had no side effects except feeling tired and lower back pain, but it's nothing like the fatigue I had on Taxotere.  Texasrose, I can't imagine losing 20 pounds in a week. Do the docs know why you don't have an appetite? Have you tried drinking Boost or something like that? At least, you'd be getting some nutrition. I'm glad your edema is better. I hope your doctors figure out how to relieve your other side effects. You don't have time for that if you're running after three children.  Hugs, Trish",

I woke up at 3:30 am with a terrible headache and a swollen and red face. I called the on-call dr., and he told me to take the dexamethasone that I had left from Taxotere, along with Benedryl. He told me to call back in two hours to let him know how I was doing. In the meantime, I started vomiting, which I've never done with chemo, so he told me to take one of my anti-nausea drugs (don't) remember which one. The headache finally stopped at 7 pm, so I started feeling better. I called the dr. again this morning to ask about dosage of the meds, and he told me to call tomorrow morning and to go in to see the dr. The swelling is a little better today, and the headache hasn't returned. I know this isn't serious compared to se's others had, but it was scary and totally unexpected. Has anyone else had these se's with Kadcyla? Does anyone know if the drug builds up and has a cumulative effect as far as se's go? I'm eager to find out what the onc has to say. I appreciate any information. Hugs, Trish",

My daughter and I went shopping yesterday, and my back hurt most of the time. If I sit down for a few minutes, it lets up for a little while so I can walk some more. It never hurts when I'm sitting, only when I'm standing or walking. It seems to get a little better during the 3rd week of the chemo cycle. I assume that it has something to do with the Kadcyla, but I don't really know for sure.",

Can we start a new thread for those of us who are currently on it? I'll be starting Kadcyla Monday after failing PH. PHT worked great until I dropped the Taxotere; then, I had progression when I was just on Perjeta and Herceptin. It's scary because this is the first time I've had to move on to a new drug. I was dx with liver mets last May and have been on PHT the entire time since then.  I'm interested in how long you've been on Kadcyla and how is your quality of life? What side effects are you having? I've read as much as I could find, and the main se's seem to be nausea, dry mouth, low platelets, and neuropathy. Does everyone get all of these se's. Are there other common se's? I appreciate any information that can help me know what to expect. I wish all the best to everyone.

I refuse to allow breast cancer to define who I am. It's just something that I went through for a few months in the past. It has nothing to do with my life today. Yes, it takes a while to get to this point, but it will happen. I think the new normal that people talk about is knowing that bc can come back and learning to live with that knowledge without letting it overwhelm you, but, in reality, no one knows what will happen to them. To me, that's life; that IS normal. All the best to you. You will be celebrating milestones, too, and you will have your normal life again before you know it. Hugs, Trish ",

I'm extremely thankful for every healthy day that I live. More than anything else, I think that surviving cancer has made me appreciate every minute of every day. I know that I don't stress over small stuff as much as many other people do or as much as I did in the past. I'm constantly aware that I've been very fortunate. I wish the best to all of my Stage III sisters who are going through treatment right now. It will end, and you will get your life back. You will get to the point where you don't think about bc all the time. I also wish the best to those who are celebrating anniversaries as I am.

I always know that other Stage III sisters will appreciate the significance of these special anniversaries, and I hope I can offer hope to others more recently diagnosed. I know I'm always encouraged when I see other ladies posting their special milestones. We all celebrate for each other. Shelly, my onc requires me to have the Dexa scans every two years. As long as they're ok, he is allowing me to remain on Arimidex.  Claire, my surgeon suggested that I wait for two years before having recon, so I did. Plus, I wasn't really ready. At first, I just wanted to get through treatment and start to feel somewhat normal again. Then, I took a lot of time researching and deciding what kind of recon I wanted to have. I'm glad that I took the time. I feel very comfortable that I chose the procedure that is right for me. I wanted to know all of my options before making a decision. I ended up traveling out of state for my surgery. Shelly, it's fine if you'd like to send me a PM. I hope you're doing well after your DIEP surgery. SherriG, of course, I remember you, too. I'm always happy when I still see you on here, still lending support to other ladies. I hope you're doing well. You'll soon be having a special anniversary, too! Hugs to everyone, Trish ",
