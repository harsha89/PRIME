I haven't posted in awhile I've been busy trying to figure out what the heck is going on with my pathology report and my oncotype DX report. I got an 18 on my oncotype (0 to 18 is low reacurrance) the oncologist said because of the score I didn't need chemo. Went two days later to my BS and she said she totally disagreed with the oncologist so I'm going for a second and third opinion. In the mean time, the original oncologist calls and says she has been thinking about my case and feels she wants to do more testing so she is sending the tumor for a mammoprint test?? Anyone else get this genetic testing? Tried to look them up and compare the two but soooo hard to understand. She said the mammoprint will only show low reacurrance or high so if I fall in the high she may rethink the treatment. Crazy crazy stuff. I'm not begging for chemo but I'm 46 I have two kids I want to be around to see my grand kids so I feel why not do EVERYTHING to prevent a reacurrance??!! Any one else going through this? Just wish it was black and white but with cancer it seems to be always gray. Had my last fill Tuesday also. Only had two fills, one 50cc the second 60cc and I'm done! I have no idea how much they filled me with at surgery but never had to fill my left side only my right and I swear I'm bigger then I was originally B almost C, now definitely C. No pain during the fills at all just pressure and fullness with some discomfort for two days. Went for PT who specializes in lymphodemia BEST thing I ever did! Having trouble with my right side can't raise my arm straight over my head (have cording on both sides ) she helped me through excersizes, I popped some of the cording on the right ( didn't hurt but sounded gross) and have a little but more movement. Highly recommend PT. Has anyone gone to any counseling or groups yet? I feel like meeting other woman close to home going through this but I know this sounds strange but I'm nervous. Almost like I don't want to believe I belong there.....can't get a grip on my emotions. Please tell me I'm not alone with these crazy ups and downs. Last thing I'm going to say after this very long post (sorry). Back to the BS she told me my tumor was 2.5cm originally thought it was 1.7cm hence the reason she disagreed with the oncologist. She called the tumor very angry. Well guess what...,,,I'm just as angry at the stupid tumor!!! Ok I'm officially done.",

Went for an MRI last Tuesday to check out the left breast (right breast has invasive ductal carcinoma) and got a call Friday at 4 that they saw something on my left side. I'm going in today Monday October 28 for an ultra sound. Here is where I'm confused....I'm getting a bi-lateral so why do they want to do an ultra sound? Are they going to want to do a biopsy too? It just seems strange. Of course I called my Dr. but she was in surgery all day and it was 4 on Friday. My original date for surgery was October 29 but was changed. Glad I can go trick or treating with my little guy now! :)",

OMG they warmed me but no one could have prepared me for this!! Anyone else feeling like s_it! No pun intended, ok maybe a little! Tried to just take Valium today and Tylenol. Big mistake ouch ouch ouch. Went back to Percocet couldn't handle the pain. Tomorrow I will be making prune juice cocktails regularly. Maybe just me but don't remember much mentioned about that terrible part of it. To all going in to surgery good luck! I was so scared but again it was the unknown. 5 hr surgery. 2 hrs to come out of anesthesia and I too had a patch behind my ear and asked for anti nausea meds in my IV. When I woke up I felt pretty good. I couldn't eat anything ( no appetite ) but drank a little water. No nausea. Tuesday November 5th operation Thursday November 8th home. Tray next to chair with: meds, paper pen, water, back scratcher ( my back was always itchy) couldn't reach it with out it. Phone , one of those grabber things, tissues and remote control. Walked around a lot even up and down stairs just NO lifting. Hardest part was my dog usually sits on my lap but for now he can't he just stares and whines. My little guy. 6yrs. old if you remember I was scared to tell him. He took it like a six year old Oh ok mommy! Easy peasy as he would say. Good luck to all.

Up until 12/6 I had a hard time moving, was afraid to drive because I really didn't think with my inability to move it would be safe. Couldnt reach anything in the cabinets.... It sucked!! Mentally I felt depressed because I thought this is my new normal and I really hate it. I finally got an appointment with a physical therapist who specializes in lymphodemia. I didn't have lymphodemia but went to her because my plastic surgeon said she was great and I needed someone who understood the whole process MX, TE etc. Well two weeks later and some hard work. (The excersizes hurt) I feel 95% better, no joke! I had cording under both arms and down to where my drainage holes were. She was so great! A couple times while she was feeling the cords they popped and although it sounded gross it didn't hurt and It helped with my movement. For me I think I was so afraid to move after surgery because I didn't know what feelings were normal and I was afraid my incision would rip open, I just didn't move hence the cording and scar tissue. She knows just how much to do, and she gave me hints for example, I still feel like I have a sunburn on my chest, she told me to take a wash cloth and gently rub it in circles across my chest in the shower. The nerve endings are going crazy from being cut and the rubbing will help with that weird \" sunburn\" feeling. I can't say enough about the physical therapy benefits!! I now have almost full range (still some pulling) but, better than that I almost feel somewhat normal again. She first works on range of motion than she will work on strength and than endurance and stamina. I hope hope hope you have someone you can go to. The surgeons are only concerned about the cancer. Once they are done, your mental health and well being aren't really a concern to them. Sad but true so the next step is trying to get help with our mental state. Please don't give up. We have all been through so much but there is more help out there. You can also register with the American cancer society and they will help with all kinds of things 1800-227-2345. Our local YMCA offers Live Strong which is free to all cancer patients you can go to the Y gym and have a personal trainer help with your strength training etc. I know we are not at that point YET but I'm just letting everyone know there is so much out there for us. Hugs to all stay strong!",

I love my doctors but they forget to tell you things and don't get into the \"practical\" things you need to know. Like-constipation mimi32 you know what I'm talking about. I cut down on my Percocet cut them in 1/2 during the day full one at night to help with not getting constipated again took me 6 days to finally go ugh!! The Valium didn't seem to affect me. Also the drains suck! I had two sorry I know some of you had a lot more do I shouldn't complain. Draining was a pain in the butt and my right one always hurt. Got them out this past Monday!!!! Yay!!!! Showering- I was able to shower as soon as I got home ( in the hospital tues,wed,thurs-home) needed my DH to shower me (aaah it was wonderful) lol, the shower not him showering me. You need help for a couple days to a week at least for me I had no range if motion so couldn't shower myself. Three nodes removed each side ( through my mx incision no extra cutting) all clear yay!! 2 1/2 weeks later drains out, showering myself but ps wants me In and out of shower in 2 min. She doesn't want the drain incisions to get wet. So I wash my hair in sink first do a sponge bath on top go in shower use removable spray shower head for bottom half. It's a pain but she got me freaked out about infections. During the hospital stay I got 7 heparin shots for clotting don't know if that's normal but I'm being honest those suckers hurt. I alternated legs each time. They also put compression things on my legs to help circulation again don't know if everyone gets that or not. The lymph node area defiantly hurts more than the MX. I really had no pain from the MX just felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest, felt heavy. I'm healing really well so far. Chest just feels tight and heavy. Left the hospital with boobs TE's in both sides nothing but thick absorption gauze over them with the post surgery bra. Took the gauze off the day after I came home and was really really happy at how they looked. Actually surprised. Thought it would be total frankinboob but it wasn't. My ps was able to do a skin/nipple sparring MX surgery so besides the sutures they look like boobs! I had trouble finding a comfortable bra so after a couple pissy days (you have those too) some one suggested a bandeau. Went to the bra store and found that the ones with the cups work great! They have support they don't rub on my sutures or my drain incisions-perfect. Although i am only a b cup at the moment don't know how they will be later?! So ladies good luck saying prayers to all sorry for long post but it's 4:00 in the AM and trouble sleeping again so here I am rambling. :)",

All went well. Nurses where great although when they talk to you about the possible side effects it's scary. No problems except they ran the anti nausea meds to fast and I was so dizzy it was like a pscyodelic high type of dizziness. That was not fun it lasted for a good hour then got better. I played scrabble with a friend, we laughed talked to other patients, drank tons of h2o and ate and all and all had a good time. Don't know what the next few days will bring we will see. Oh and I didn't get a port they went right into my vein in my arm. They had trouble finding the vein but eventually did and it was fine. I am only getting TC 4x so my onc said the ports not necessary.  Good luck to all my Heros out there we will forge through this together!!! Hugs.  Nancy",

I had my first treatment January 8 th and I can tell you it's been no picnic here either!! Feel like I have the flu?! Coughing fever just feeling like crap!! They put me on an antibiotic thinking it may be a infection but it is whipping my butt!! As far as the nuelasta shot, a whole new set of pain. I took the Claritin the day before the day of and was going to take it the day after and forgot. That won't happen again, I will remember to take it and may try a couple days after. The lower back pain started Sunday night (the shot was Friday). I had a hard time sleeping, sitting and bending down.  My mouth feels like sand paper, anyone have a tip on that? My head feels like a soaked tennis ball,  feel swollen from the steroids and sweating/hot all the time, ugh I truly didn't think I'd have this many SE. I thought I'd be able to work through this but so far I worked the Thursday after treatment and off since then. I own a retail store and I \"outed\" myself prior to my BMX because I would be out for several weeks and my customers would notice. I'm not so worried about losing my hair except for my 6 yr old. Like you lisacm, I don't want him embarrassed or anyone pointing my cancer out to him. I've been very vague as far as my condition with him and don't want the bald head to frighten him. My husband and I disagree in our approach with the explanation. I believe in telling him about the disease and saying the word to him so he doesn't hear it from someone else. My husband believes we can \"skate by\" with little information or explanation. ???  I just don't know.  Feeling worn down, not just from the chemo. I was in a safe place mentally through all this I called it my project mode. I took this on like a project, gathered my information decided on a game plan and forged on but wow, having a tough time now. Maybe time to talk to someone. Anyway, good luck to everyone and thanks so much for being here to listen and for your help!  We all need to stick together!! Hugs!",

I'm doing TC 4x once every three weeks. My Onc said no port, is anyone else NOT having a port?  Read about the cold cap but I'm with you calmandstrong.. Just going to see what happens don't think I could deal with that along with all the other crap. I'm feeling the same way I did prior to surgery, the unknown is so scary!! Will I lose my hair? how quickly? will I feel sick, nauseous, tired, cranky? My husband wants me to cut my hair short ( buzz Short ) now before It starts to come out, he doesn't understand my need to hang onto it for a little longer. It's not really the hair it's something else I can't describe. Maybe the loss of the other me or the obviousness of the illness. I'm not vain, I'll \"wear\" my baldness like a badge of honor, like a warrior. But, I need to keep it for a couple more days.  I'm sure you understand. Thanks for listening. Good luck to everyone.
