      "Content": "TruckGirl wrote: Hi. I am new to this site & joined in hopes of hearing from others about their reconstructive process. I had a right side mastectomy 10/14/2014, with a tissue expander placement the same day. I went through the \"weekly fill-ups\" for a few months, then had the permanent implant surgery in April, 2015. I was not happy with the size or shape of the implant after healing so it was redone using a tear drop shaped implant late November, 2015. It is still healing & a bit swollen but I am still not loving the overall appearance. My questions is - is it normal to have multiple implant surgeries? My PS says it is but that's the answer I'd expect from him. I love his style, demeanor, office staff, etc. so I hate to think that I should consider going elsewhere. I wonder if my serious OCD is causing me to expect too much & if I am just finally coming to terms with this being my new normal... I understand every case is different, I just did not anticipate this being such a long, drawn out adventure. Any thoughts? Thank you!! Log in to post a reply",
