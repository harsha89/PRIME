I made it through the 4x AC without much trouble (good drug regime from MO team), however this week I started Taxol and have horrible joint and muscle pain. Tried epsom soak and Claratin-D and ibuprofen but doesnt really help. Any suggestions? My PT says it often settles into areas of previous trauma and I had a severe sprain this summer which is exactly where it hurts worst now. Aargh. I was so worried about neuropathy but got myalgia instead.",
