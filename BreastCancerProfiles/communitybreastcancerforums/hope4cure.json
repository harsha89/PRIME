The interesting thing about the path report.....the right breast was the one with the DCIS and in that same breast they found something else that they called Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia.  She explained it as not cancer, not pre-cancer but something that could have potentially developed into cancer down the road.  So, I feel that I definitely made the right decision to have chosen the bilateral mastectomy.  I just want to be free of it and some may have viewed my route as being overkill but not I - I don't trust this stuff!!!   I will go the extra mile to rid myself of it.    I researched it more when I came home and found out that Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia can turn into ILCS or ILC.   It just floors me.  Cancer is so scary and you have no idea you have this inside you.   I don't know if I have a heightened awareness of cancer now or what but I think it is entirely too commonplace.   Too many people are coming up with it. Did you all see the story of the 7 year old girl who doctors took out six of her organs to remove a cancerous tumor?   She went home from the hospital yesterday and is doing great.   Stories like this one really gives you admiration for this little person.  I have a 7 year old daughter and I could not imagine going through that - that poor family.  The little girl was amazing - so beautiful, sweet and optimistic.   I hope she has a long and happy life.
