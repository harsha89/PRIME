NormaJean: My HER2 status was equivocal (uncertain) on the first test and also equivocal on the FISH followup. I think my actual score was around 2.1. My Ki67 was very high, at 75%, so I'm worried that the Oncotype will come back high as well. Melinda",

I am interested in the use of chemotherapy on stage I cancers. it seems fairly common, yet articles I read question the effectiveness of chemo on BC vs. the negative side effects. I'm wondering if women have noticed that oncologists are quick to recommend chemo, or if they seem moderate in their recommendations. Melinda",
