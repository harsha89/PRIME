My scalp hurts when I touch it, which I hear is a sign that it's going to happen.  I went to a wig salon to pick out a wig even before my first treatment and I highly recommend that.  You need to be prepared on this one.  My husband is going to buzz my hair in the next 2 days, and come Monday morning I will be showing off my new hair do at work.  If you are not a wig person you can get some cute hats and scarfs, they really do have many nice things out there these days.  I opted for a nice wig that was very close to my original hair style and color, as I work in a large coporate office and am in the open all the time, and I would feel more comfortable with a wig on.

The 2nd dose of AC knocked me out a litlte more then the first one, was just way more tired after I got home which at noon yesterday and now I'm wide awake at 2:30 in the morning... thank you steroids! Karen, I was so nervous about starting the treatments, and I got a little nervous again yesterday morning. It's such unknown territory, we don't know what is going to happen or how it will make us feel...I can tell you that so far for me it is not that bad!  I take off the day of treatment and the day after, which is a Thursday and a Friday, relax on the weekend, try to do a little here and there, but nothing to overdo it.  Then I'm good for work on Monday.  After my 1st treatment I was actually able to put in full 8 hour days until my 2nd treatment.  Drinking tons and tons of water is a must.  You can get dehydrated very quickly, keep drinking alot every day.  I have had absolutely no nausea or vomiting, so far, knock on wood!  I am taking Emend and Zofran for that and it seems to be working like a charm.  My biggest problem honestly so far is being kept awake from the steroids.  I dont know if everyone gets the steroids.  If you do you can ask for a light sleeping pill and it will help out.  Also the week after treatment you do get constipated pretty bad, so take a stool soffner every night! Best of luck to you and keep strong, as everyone else will say, and has said to me, it is \"doable\".  You will have days where you feel like u can run a marathon, and days that you just can't stay awake. Take the good days to their advantage!! Good luck and let us know how you make out! Sue",

I have been going topless for several weeks now, but just not at work.  I dont know what it is!??! I have been without hair for 10 months now... and have changed my wigs from month to month coming to the office, so I have no problem with that part of it ... it's not like I have a secret or anything!  (hey I think I'm talking myself into somelthing here:-) I do use a mousse and it seems to calm it down.  I am just so used to how my hair used to be! I guess this is the awkward stage of growing your hair out. Ok here I am (please excuse my silly daughter.. she seems to be in a \"tongue sticking out phase\" ... this is what happens when I put the mousse in (am I spelling mousse right?!;-)  OOPs the top of my head is cut off:o)",

But when I started eatting I felt much better.  Even got out to the park with my daughter this afternoon.  Naps seems to be the key, even if I just sit still for 30 minutes. Aggie, I picked out a wig and will be going back to the salon when my hair starts to thin and fall out and the hairdresser/owner of the salon will give my head a buzz and she'll fit the wig on and style it the way I want... I guess that'll be in about 10 days or so?!  I did see some cute hats with hair/bands on headcovers.com. Guess we need to be a little stylish during this time! Thanks! Sue",

I had alot of abnormal things going on in the boob that made it swell up and get hard. So they thought it was all tumor.  I'm sure the AC kicked it down a bit too.  My hair started to grow back, but it'll fall out again of course. BUMMER.  I worked thru my AC treatments, except for the day of and after tx.  But, not sure how I will be for TC. Anyone work thru TC?? I hope I can cause it does help me emotionally to go about my daily routine thru this entire thing. Thanks for listening!  Good luck to everyone starting this month. Sue",

I too had very long thick hair but I found a wig that really did match quit well and no one could tell it was even a wig!  It was a Louis Ferre \"Jennifer\".  I bought it at a local salon, but afterwards found out that I could have saved about $200 if I bought it online. But of course it's tough the first time buying a wig online when you can't try it on, and you can't return them either.  You can look on my blog as I have pictures there (of all my wigs, but the long one was my first.)  Here is a good online source for wigs, I have bought a couple from. This is the one I mentioned http://www.wigsalon.com/wigx.htm?wig=534.  I recommend a wig with a \"monofiliament cap\" definitely. It gives the appearance of a real part, and they are just made better.  After a while I started having fun with having to wear wigs and started to go shorter and shorter.  I lost my hair twice, cause I had to do chemo twice, so my wig wearing days lasted 10 months. Good luck with the chemo. It's not an easy road, but it's the road you need to travel to get all that cancer out of your body!!!  Keep hydrated and rest alot. Sue",

I am doing chemo prior to surgery and I started 2 weeks after diagnosis.  So I'm in a different boat then you, but I am sure others will give you some insight on what their plan was.  But look at it this way, at least the cancer was cut out of you.  Assuming when you say \"treatment\" , you will be having chemo or rads now? Good luck to you! Sue",

I started wearing my wig for the first time this Monday morning... I work in a large corporate office for an executive... so I was kinda insecure about coming in the first day with my wig... so I was taking pictures of me on the way in in my car with my cell phone... just to see how I looked!  Today I didn't have to do it! Also look for a salon specifically that does wigs for cancer patients.  That's what I did, I didn't even have to pick the wig out. The salon owner sat me in a chair, told me she'd be right back , and when she came back she put this wig on my head and I can't tell you how big the smile was on my face! The service from these shops are more personalized and they really do know what we are going thru.  If you go to a normal wig shop you might not get that kind of service. Sue",

I went so far to make an appointment at a salon in New York City who did this, and clients were some celebrities.  But then I decided against it, and I am so gald I did.  I am comfortable with my regular run of the mill synthetic wig (if you want to see a picture of me wearing it let me know and I'll send you a private message).  The scalp issue is true, I am seeing some drys spots especially along my hair line above my forehead so you might want to think about that also. Another thing is that how long do you think you'll need a \"temporary\" hair piece?  That was kind of my decision maker.  Usually all of us are looking at maybe a year or so.  Also I wear scarfs and hats at home on the weekends, and the minute I get home after work I tear my wig off and it feels great! I'm not ashamed of having no hair, my husband doesn't mind, and my daughter thinks it's funny! And I get so many compliments from my co-workers on my wig... many of them don't even know it's a wig! Good luck to you! Sue",
