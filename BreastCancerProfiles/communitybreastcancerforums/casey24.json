No breast cancer history in immediate family, both parents adopted so no other history available. Mom had cervical and lung cancer(early 40), dad had prostate cancer.  They found \"an asymmetrical density in left breast in axillary tail\" BiRads 0 incomplete. 4 days later had a spot compression viewed \"a small oval opacity\",  \"no architectural distortion\" and the ultrasound revealed \"small hypoechoic oval lesion at the 2 o'clock position without any acoutstic shadowing(1.2cmX8X5mm) which most likely represents normal fibroglandular tissue\". The final opinion indicates \"Normal ultrasound of left breast, no suspicious lesion\",' low to moderate density parenchyma and asymmetrical densities in both breasts'. My family doc said the report is normal, annual screening is the only thing to do. I only know the above because I asked for the reports. I think I should rely on the expertise of the radiologist and sonographer,,but concerned that it is a \"lesion\" not a \"cyst\". Here's where I think I'm crying wolf,,,I never had lumps or bumps when I was younger, I find it weird that one tiny lesion was found at this time,,,,any thoughts would be appreciated.  Thanks.",
