I feel like I've been going to numerous appts, having test after test, procedure after procedure and still don't have a surgery date set. My mammogram was done Sept. 1st. and I was diagnosed Sept. 17th. I did do a second opinion appt with one oncologist but decided to stay w/my original hospital (based on that oncologist's preference for the chemo and 5 yr drug my original hospital will use.) That appt. didn't interfere with any appts w/my current Drs. Yet, they still haven't set a surgery date set. I was finally called back this morning and was told a surgery date would be set. But guess what? No one called me back today to tell me the date. (Even though I told them I was concerned because 1.) A lot of time and passed already and 2.) My insurance deductibles \"reset\" on January 1st.) So yes, you have every reason to be upset about waiting for six more weeks. I don't have any suggestions for you. I'm just acknowledging your frustration is understandable and I feel like I'm in the same boat.",

I got negative feedback regarding this \"order\" of surgeries, too. But, since then, I've been giving it a lot of thought. No one on here knows (until now) that my cancer is in a very unusual position (7 o'clock position, right breast) nor do they know my exact breast size or my surgeon's experience with cancer removal and breast reconstruction. (Btw, I did get second opinions and the exact same surgery/reconstruction and treatment plans were recommended.) I do love the many wonderful members here and the support system this discussion board provides. Breastcancer.org is a terrific place. But I'm going to leave the surgery part in the hands of the surgeons. That said, if you feel uncomfortable about any part of your surgery, you should get a second opinion from a surgeon. Neither of my surgeons, nor my oncologist and radiologist, were the least bit offended about me getting a second opinion. In fact, they encouraged it. Much love and good luck to you. xoxoxo",
