I was never told to ice my lymph node site, woke up feeling pretty sore there. My breast is swollen but doesn't hurt. Didn't take any tylenol yesterday today at work I took a few. My Dr. read the post biopsy report late last night, sent me a note he hopes to give me pathology report by Friday. Part of me wants to know before the weekend & part of me doesn't. My cousin called discussing our Holiday Party he could tell something was wrong I did tell him swore him to keep my secret which I know he will keep. Has anyone thought about or getting gentic testing? BRCA1 or BRCA2? I have an Aunt fighting ovarian cancer, my mom's first cousin passed away from ovarian cancer. No breast cancer in my immediate/extended family. Personally I'm trying to stay positive but it is driving me crazy, don't do good with the unknown. Thanks for letting me go on.",

Sitting with OB at a pancake breakfast isn't my idea of fun. My problem last year he had become the director of OB Medical school new staff & disorganized, thought things had improved I had no issues getting a prescription refilled this year. I will get answers 1 way or another Monday. I will contact nurse first thing & then GP who I had asked to have report sent to. My GP isn't in the same network they may have to call & get it faxed which I will demand if I can't get answers by noon. Sadly Monday is payroll & month end close or I would be at his office waiting for him. Honestly I wish they would let the nurse navigator from the Breast Center do the calling, that is who I will end talking to if they find anything.",

Quick update - I called in a favor my cousins xgirlfriend is a PA got me into see an oncologist surgeon this morning did a exam including another ultrasound of lymph node. I will have my lymph node removed & further genetic testing next Wednesday due to size & symptoms he thinks it is best to remove vs another core biopsy. Core biopsy didn't do much testing except for breast cancer even in my lymph node. Have a lab slip to get a ton more blood work done, week following I will see Hematologist to rule out lymphoma. Sad that isn't what you know but who you know. I feel much better with a game plan & no longer waiting (I still haven't heard from Dr. in my home town). Thoughts & prayers for each & everyone one of you, solid game plan & full recovery. Best wishes",

I have an amazing family us cousins are meeting tonight thinking there will be about 20 of us, even one cousin is flying in from VA to MI for our dinner. We are going to a nice restaurant I will have some good wine & food celebrate life to the fullest. My crazy family has started celebrating 50th this summer myself & 2 cousins turned 50 we all had a huge celebration in MT, trip of a lifetime for me. I love the outdoors, peace & quite. Enough of my rambling off to try & get a few more hours of sleep before everyone is up - 8am basketball game & 10am 5K for other daughter. Hope everyone has a great weekend.
