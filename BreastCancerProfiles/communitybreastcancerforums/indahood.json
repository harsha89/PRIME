Got a taste of that a few months back with sciatica, thankfully my body has healed it's self as it's so frustrating when nothing but painkillers works to improve a painful situation. I get it. I think the trail I'm going to take is to see if they can improve the cosmetic outcome despite giving higher single doses of radiation. Overall, I will have less radiation, than the standard treatment and they will be able to stay away from lungs and heart. They anticipate that long term side effects will be mitigated but the short term might be more difficult. Since it's the long term ones that scare me, I'm pretty sure I'm going to go ahead and be apart of the trial. Wish they didn't want to use radiation on me. Darn. good luck with your treatment, Laurie",

I too have to travel for Rads but not even close to how far you have to drive. Poor you. 175 people are taking part at Tom Baker and 100 more elsewhere (although I don't know where) so maybe check it out with your ROC. It's called the ACCEL trial. Looks like you'd be a good candidate. It's for early stage breast cancer who have undergone breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy). I think they want good margins though, which I have. Hope that helps. Also I know that you can stay at the Tom Baker free of charge. Here's wishing you lots of good outcomes this 2018, Laurie",

It's a clinical trial of using higher dosage but to smaller area. Only 5 treatments and overall, less radiation. The trial will be testing whether I have more cosmetic issues. It's a small trial being done in Alberta, Canada. Anyone else out there done anything similar? Kinda scared about being a guinea pig but at the same time 5 treatments, apparently less side effects.

Thanks to LEAPFROG, MJHJAN and DLB for your insights. I have finally had a chance to reconnect and it was a bit of what all of you said. My friend is in pain, not very mobile, can't drive and is tired of talking about cancer. It was so helpful to read what you all wrote even if it was after the fact. So I thank you again. indahood",

I have not seen her in a year as I was away traveling before being diagnosed myself. Since I have been back, I have reached out to her and at first, before I was dx, she was into going out for coffee but since I have been diagnosed, she is not very receptive to seeing me. Any stage 4 people out there know what she must be feeling? I am for sure respecting her need for space, and not pushing at all, but I would like to understand. It would be nice to be able to rekindle our friendship, and for me since I too am going through chemo. Anyway, if anyone has some insight for me I would love it so that I can be as gentle as I can with my friend. Laurie",
