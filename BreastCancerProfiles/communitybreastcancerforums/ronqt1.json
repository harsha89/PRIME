I am 60 years of age and have had arthritic problems with my knees previously.  I read your bio and mine is pretty similar.   As soon as I finish with this message I will have breakfast and take my pill.  Is there any weight gain involved. After what I have conquered, believe it or not I am worried about stupid weight gain.  To any gals first going through surgery, try to stay in hospital for at least 3 nights. Mine wanted me out after 2 but I stayed for 3.  Another solution which I would like to share is that when I initially came home from the hospital, I had the drain for a week. Of course I no longer have that but I had problems sleeping with my sports bra that Ii wear during the day. My husband and I went to a specialty bra shop and purchased a sleeping  bra (Glamorise), which has .made sleeping more comfortable.  I am counting the days until the TE is out of me.  Thank you sister survivor.

I did not want the others to get upset with me and ask why was I there, so I investigated and found this site. Nothing beats it. This is a great site and a learning experience as well. God Bless.

Did that today and yesterday, hooray for paper plates and  ordering in.  However, I am in agony on the masectomy side of my body, hoping I did not do too much. My upper right arm is tingling light crazy and sometimes numb which I did expect to happen. So far with Arimidex is just fine. Hannahbears Mom: I see I am one month behind you, my masctomy in Oct., going for my second fill this week and from reading your blog, can I anticipate April when this will be over. Ladies, hope you are all preparing for a wonderful Christmas, I don't often post, but I do enjoy my sister stories.",

The most relevant provisions of the Defense Act with respect to extension of the COBRA subsidy are as follows: (1) Provide an extension of the COBRA subsidy eligibility to February 28, 2010; (2) Extend the nine month time period for application of the subsidy by an additional six months, for a total of fifteen months; (3) Permit retroactive payment of premium for up to sixty days after enactment of the extension for those assistance-eligible individuals (\"AEI\") whose subsidy expired on November 30, 2009 and who did not pay their premium for December coverage; (4) Mandate an additional notice to all AEIs (i) who are on COBRA on or after November 1st or, (ii) whose qualifying event is a termination of employment on or after November 1st; (5) Correct the current inconsistency in ARRA which requires both the termination of employment and eligibility for COBRA to be within the eligibility date. Only the date of the involuntary termination of employment will have to be on or before February 28, 2010. The COBRA benefits can begin at a later time. You gals who are computer savvy with these great pictures are terrific. Merry Christmas!!",
