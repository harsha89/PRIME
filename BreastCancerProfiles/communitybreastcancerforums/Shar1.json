      "Content": "Sep 12, 2012 10:21AM - edited Sep 12, 2012 10:21AM by Shar1 I did not have the MRI but I would think that BSGI/MBI is less traumatic---the procedure took only about 30 minutes and was similar to a mammogram except I was sitting down.   Insurance does cover it and I think it is cheaper than the MRI.  I am pretty sure it is not a \"screening test\" but more of a diagnostice test.  It is primarily used if the mammogram is inconclusive.   I actually had the opportunity to meet a lady that had a lump that she could feel to the touch but yet it did not show up on her mammogram because of density.  She said that her doctor pushed for her to have the BSGI and it found a cancer.   Bottom line is that you have to be your own advocate.  Mammograms will continue to be the \"first\" test for me but if I'm not comfortable with the results of my mammogram next year I will push for MBI again.  Insurance companies are difficult to deal with but don't allow them to dictate your breast health!",
