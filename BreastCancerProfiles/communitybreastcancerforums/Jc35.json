You see  I found lump in my left breast a while back but convinced myself it was nothing, just changes in my breasts after breast feeding (they got very large throughout both pregnancies) then after weaning the reduced in size considerably and changed a lot, I guess this is why I put it down to that.  I finished breast feeding 18 months ago.  So on sat I spoke to my husband about it as felt more pronounced and went to get it checked out. The gp examined my left breast and said because it is a mass that is quite moveable that she reckons it fibroadenoma but is sending me for an urgent breast check (2 week waiting list in ireland) I'm 35, no pain no discharge.  But am really worried and annoyed with myself for putting it off for so long.  If it was something more sinister would I have had more symptoms.  Is a two weeks wait normal, feeling very nervous. Thank you for your support x x Log in to post a reply",
