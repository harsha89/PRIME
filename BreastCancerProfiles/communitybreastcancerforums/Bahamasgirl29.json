While checking my breast my obgyn said she felt a palpable mass in my right breast under my nipple and wanted me to feel it. Honestly I don't feel it. She sent me to do an ultrasound even though she said she was sure it was nothing. During the ultrasound the sonographer said she felt a small mass and asked if I wanted to feel it. Again I didn't feel anything. I guess I'm not sure what to look for. Nothing showed on the ultrasound. She said because she didn't see anything she wanted their doctor to come in and double check and he said he didn't see anything as well. My obgyn called and said everything was good just like she expected and we can continue on the path to get pregnant. I was happy because my obgyn is very thorough but now I feel like I'm not sure what to doand I can't stop googling. Also for a few months every now and then my breast would hurt and itch. Thanks. Any advice would help greatly. Log in to post a reply",
