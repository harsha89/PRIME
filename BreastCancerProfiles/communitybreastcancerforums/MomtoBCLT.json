In March my problems started with tenderness in my left breast, then breast puckering, then it started to clear up but then new symptoms started.  The tenderness went away but I now have a deep ache.  I also had an icy/hot sensation that would go through my breast, into my arm pit and down my arm a bit.  This is not happening to often now though. It felt like heart burn behind my breast. The deep ache has turned more into pain now that comes and goes. The breast is slightly puckered again. My left breast is swollen a bit now and is also raised higher than my right breast but is also slight.  I know my own body so I can notice a difference (my husband notices a difference to) but I don't know that my doctor would. I have to put a pillow under my arm when I sleep so that it doesn't hurt laying on my side, yet when I try to find a sore spot when touching it with my hand I cant find a sore spot anymore.  It is really strange.  Should I just wait and see if it worsens, make another appointment with my PCP, or ask to be sent to a bigger hospital? My gut tells me to go to the bigger hospital that has an IBC clinic, but I almost feel like it would be a waste of time if my symptoms aren't more obvious visually. So far I have had a mammogram, ultrasound, hormone test, and a CT scan all which have come back normal. ",

Hormone levels are normal. The breast specialist I saw said everything felt normal and it wasn't IBC.  I didn't trust his opinion at all because he said he has never hear of such a thing when I told him about having an icy/hot sensation. He said I was having psychosomatic symptoms.  I have an Icy/Hot sensation still that comes and goes, sorenss if I move my breast to the side and touch my chest wall.  I can't sleep because my arm keeps rubbing against my side and irritating whatever the heck it is.  Slight skin puckering under my armpit on my side and a small spot on my breast. The breast specialist said the puckering on my side wasn't breast tissue and so dismissed it. The puckering that I had on my breast, he dismissed because he didn't see it when it looked worse.  The breast specialist refused to do a biopsy.  My doctor would do one but where?  Do I just tell him to do it where it is sore?  I can't feel an area with my fingers that feels suspicious to tell him where to check.  Most of my symptoms are internal.  I'm so tired of trying to figure out what this is, that I am feeling run down.

The specimen consists of a punch biopsy of skin 3 mm in diameter. 2ns.  These are punch biopsies of skin each of which reveal minimal hyperkeratosis.  No cytologic atypia is evident.  The subjaccent dermis reveals no apparent abnormality Final dianosis:  Skin, left breast upper and lower, punch biopsies; benign keratoses I realize that it is begnign, Yeah!!! But, what does hyperkeratosis really mean?  I looked it up on google and I get thickening of skin. It is benign, but I have something going on.  My mammogram showed a white cloudy area on it, but the radiologists and a breast specialist said that they were normal.  When I questioned the white cloudy area, the b.s. said that it was just an area of denser tissue and nothing suspicious. Now that I have hyperkeratosis on this report I am thinking my mammogram wasn't as normal as they thought.  I have an appointment at another hospital and breast specialist on June 17 so I am still going to get some more opinions.  What does this mean?

Tender:  I recently found out that you could request results.  My dh works with a guy whose wife works in the records department of the hospital where they type up the records.  She informed us that they usually have reports the same day that tests are run.  They then type them up and send them to the doctor which sometimes takes days.  She told me that everyone has the right to come in a sign for their test results so that is what I do now.  No sense waiting if I don't have to.  When I had my CT scan done she called me around noon the same day to tell me that my results were in and I could come sign for a copy. I don't think my doctor likes that I go get my own results, but that's OK.  It's my results not his.",
