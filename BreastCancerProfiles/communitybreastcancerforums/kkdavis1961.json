The report read that the changes that was seen on the last mammogram and US was due to scar tissue from the biopsy in July. Thanks everyone for your support. I go back to the BS March 8 for my pre op visit. I'll find out more then.",

I was scheduled for 1-1/2 hour surgery but was only in there about 45 minutes. I was asleep the entire time. The last thing I remember is sliding over to the operating room table. I'm really surprised that I have not had much pain. Also no nausea. They gave me a pill for nausea before the surgery and it has really helped. Also have taken the pain pills. I haven't taken any since midnight and it's around 6:30 am now. So I think I'm going to see how I do if I take any. My incision is about 2 inches. The dr said it would be 3-5 days for the pathology results. I just feel that a weight has been lifted offf my shoulder jus getting the mass out.",

      "Content": "kkdavis1961 wrote: I am scheduled to have an excisional biopsy on Tuesday 2/28. My doctor found a mass in July of last year. She sent me for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. After this they decided to do a core needle biopsy. The results came back as negative. The report said that I had calcification and fibrous tissue changes. They scheduled me to come back in 6 months for a follow up mammogram. I went last week and the radiologist said that the mass had change a little. Not sure of the specifics. My doctor sent me to see a breast surgeon this week. She feels that it needs to be taken out and biopsy to make sure that it is still benign. She said that one good thing is that my first biopsy came back negative, but she said that it still looks worrisome. She said the only way to make sure that it is not cancer is to do the biopsy. This is all new to me so of course I am scared to death. I'm wondering what to expect during and after the surgery. They are doing it as outpatient and I will be awake but they will give me something to relax me. She said I probably won't remember any of it. Also I was wondering if this is the same thing as a lumpectomy that I have been reading about. Any information any of you can give me would be appreciated. I just don't know what to expect.
