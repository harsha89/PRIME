Just remember that we are very strong women and this web site really helps us get through some of the ruff times.  It's good to be able to talk to other women who are going through the same thing and at the same time.  I have 1 more AC tx on 1/26, then I go to weekly txs starting 2/9 of taxol for 12 weeks so that puts the last chemo on 4/27, then wait a month and have to go through radiation for 33 days in a row! Still have a long way to go but I know I can do it, I have to stay positive as much as possible.  We will get through this together.  Does anyone else have to do the reconstruction surgery after all of this....my PS says I will probably have to have the lat flap done and the implants put in sometime in September.  When I think about that it seems overwhelming to know that I pretty much have to go through this stuff all of 2009.  I don't mean to be complaining about all of this, I think I started this message trying to give hope and spread some of my positive thinking....got a little off track....sorry.  Hope everyone that has txs this week will have little or no SEs. Talk to you'll soon Tricia",

I'm getting my port out the same time.  How are rads going for everyone?  My finger nails and toe nails look disgusting, hopefully that won't last too long.

To beat this you need all the help and prayers that come your way. If you ever want to talk or have any questions I'm always here. Tricia ",

The ps also told me that they might have to do the lat flap surgery or tummy tuck surgery if my skin gets too thin, but the radiation doctor said it should be okay.  I don't know but the rd made me feel alot better about all that was going on.  My daughter is a hair stylist and is getting info about wigs so I will let everyone know when I find out these things...I think we all can help each other by talking out these scary times...

My ps is still \"filling\" me every Monday and I'm with you all on being very uncomfortable when trying to aleep.  getting the power port in on Friday didn't help much either.  I have already bought my wig and thought I was okay with my hair falling out but it seems I'm not.....I had my pitty party all day Sunday.  I guess in anticipation of the week to come. After the chemo I have to wait a month to start the radiation and that will be 5 days a week for 33 days.   Then it's time to get these expanders out and put the \"real\" fake boobs in.  Always remember that we are all in this together and can help each other so much gy just listening to someone else that is going through the same thing you are and at the same time. Good luck to everyone this week and I will keep you all updated on my first treatment. Tricia ",

I am 44 and have 2 daughters of my own (23 & 13) and also have 3 step-daughters(23, 20, 17).  They have all been very supportive and my husband has been exeptional.  I still have one tube in but the PS took the others out in his office....was not very pleasant....in fact it hurt alot.  This last tube is still draining 40ml and they want it down to 30. My nodes also ahowed microscopic amounts of cancer cells...in fact it was missed by one of the doctors, I'm hoping that will shorten the amount of time with chemo....that scares me the most I guess.  The front laced wigs or full laced wigs are supposed to be the best and look more natural than all the rest....I was told that if you choose to shave your head before your hair falls out to cut it to about an inch left.   that way it won't itch as much...I'll let everyone no more info on that when I get it..I did google the front laced ones and got lots of info but I'm hoping to talk to someone who has already worn one of these. Talk to you'll later and have a happy day(smile) Tricia",
