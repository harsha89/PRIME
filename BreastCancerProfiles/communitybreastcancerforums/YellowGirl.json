My first mammogram was at 27 because they discovered I cared the BRCA gene. I have been having \"almost\" yearly mammograms and ultrasounds since. I had a hysterectomy at 32 due to precancerous cells around my cervix and they removed my ovaries, so I am also considered post menopausal but take a very lose dose of HRT which I think will need to be discontinued. My left breast recently swelled up three sizes and they thought I might have mastitis. MRI was not good and have surgical oncology appointment Friday, biopsy showed a lot of stuff and no cancer. My PCP and Radiologist do not think that the biopsy and what the MRI shows is in line. So I think the next step will be wire biopsy? My left breast has now been swollen for 6 weeks. I am basically walking around with mastitis symptoms and pain in the summer heat. It's very uncomfortable. But I know there are others who are dealing with much more so I am trying to keep my attitude in check. So this is the other breast that you are now having problems with? Did they ever give you the BIRADS category and breast density category? From what I have learned when you have extremely dense breasts like ours mammography and even ultrasound can hide a lot. I know removing that breast might seem like too much but if this continues you might be saving your life. The dismissiveness for those of use with dense breasts with clear symptoms is just reckless in my opinion, especially on a mammogram. Like I said my mammogram was clear yet my MRI was a BIRADS 4c. I might have punched someone who dismissed me based on my dense breast mammogram, I kid, but ugh! One Radiologist told me that it's like finding a snowball in a snowfield. Also, I did research because I too thought that after your ovaries are removed or you are considered post menopausal you still might have hormonal fluctuations. I know estrogen is stored in fat and some estrogen is predicted by other organs and glands, I forget which ones. But be diligent and you will know when you feel comfortable with treatment. I'm sorry you are going through this, it's very frustrating.",
