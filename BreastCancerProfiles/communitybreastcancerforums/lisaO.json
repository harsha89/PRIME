I have been checking out this discussion board since I started chemo in April but have never posted.  Decided it was about time I did after reading Otter's post about her Mum {Aussie spelling for Mom!!}.  I had the EXACT same coversation with my Mum 3 hours ago!  So I totally know how your feeling.  A huge thank you to all of you as your discussions and wisdom have helped me through the past few months. I started DD A/C April 17th and am now doing weekly Taxol, 5 down and 7 to go.  A/C was a pain in my ass and Taxol is tolerable....just!! You are all funny, smart, and amazing women..... it's a pleasure to be in your company.  In fact I feel like I already know you all thanks to my voyeuristic tendancies!! Lisa",

Rock - My eyes are blue, and ghostly piercing is more apt I would say without the eyebrows!!  Weekly Taxol is all I know, so hard to compare to your fortnightly schedule, but I will say that I have had no neuropathy or hand-foot syndrome.  Day 3 after chemo is rough with headache and fuzzy brain.  I am starting to get some serious fatigue happening, in particular if my day has been busy I will turn to jelly about 6pm....kind of like a rag doll and don't know whether to laugh or cry...  I usually do both!!  Chemopause is in full flight now and I am getting serious hot flashes and night sweats.  Had my period right through A/C but it stopped as soon as I started the Taxol.  Oh, I still manage to walk my dogs down the river every morning for 45 minutes so I'm not doing too badly.  Like all of you, I am struggling a bit with staying on top mentally of late, but 5 months into this ride it's not surprising.  Basically I'm sick and sick and tired of being sick and tired!!!  Think that's a lyric from a Chili Peppers song!! Sue - Rather than obsessive or paranoid you just sound scared and confused... a breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment will do that to the best of us.  I hear where you are coming from although my position is almost the oppostive....up to this point {37 years} I have chosen not to have children and now that the choice is possibly being taken away from me I'm a little bit freaked out which is ridiculous as I have never pictured children in my future.  No point in playing the devil's advocate with yourself...I think going with your initial gut feeling is the only way to go.  Just my opinion. Thanks again lovely ladies....Lisa",
