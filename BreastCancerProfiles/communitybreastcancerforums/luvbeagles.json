Also surgeon said mass was slightly spiculated. I guess it is what it is and will fight it head on if I am diagnosed.",

Also thankful that they did an ultrasound after the biopsy that showed he missed it. I just hope they can hit the mark this time because this waiting is driving me nuts. Just want to move on to next step be it good or bad. I am a planner and a slight control freak :). Loss of control is horrible.",
