It's a long way to USA but I am so grateful to find this forum and on-line support group as I haven't found one locally. The first thing I did was to go to the Stage 3 group discussions because I needed to know and understand members who are in the same diagnosis stage as I am. My story: I have been recently diagnosed and was so fearful when the pathology report ( based on my mastectomy performed on 10 July 2015 ) came back with Grade 3A, 3 lymph nodes affected out of 14 nodes. It has been emotionally difficult but I have learned to accept it. I am taking it slowly, one day at a time, to remain positive and be grateful for what I have. Just had my chemo port surgery yesterday and will start my chemo next Wednesday. Regimen is FEC ( 5FU + Epirubicin + Cytoxan) for 3 cycles, every 3 weeks and then followed by Taxotere for 3 cycles. I look forward to participate in this community and uphold each other as we all continue in our fight against BC and our journey to wellness ! Blessings, Rachel Tai",
