I am so glad to have found you folks! I have been reading up a storm, here. You all seem so supportive. I hadn't read about injections, prior to surgery. The surgeon explained it all but to be honest, I was pretty shell shocked in those first few weeks, and didn't hear most of it. I didn't get numbing cream, and my injections hurt. The first two were not that bad, but the third hurt, and then the dr. said, \"Now, this one is going to hurt!\". Oh. My. If I had a choice, I would definitely ask for cream. The irony is that they were unable to trace my sentinel lymph node, so I still had the dye injection after being put to under, and got to pee blue for the next 24 hours.",
