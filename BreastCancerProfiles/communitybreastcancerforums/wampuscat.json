My husband started taking weekly photos of my growth when it started during my Taxol treatments. About half way through I started seeing growth. Here are just a few pics. The first is as of last Sunday, which was 8 weeks PFC. The second is at my 8th week of 12 Taxol treatments. It is starting to get wavy. I always had a medium brown color with a little gray and I got some hightlights, so this is a new color for me! I also had stick straight hair all of my life. Kind of enjoying a little wave! I have started going topless and loving it!  ",

I will be starting on April 7.  I too have gained so much encouragement from the other women on these forums. I guess we will be walking through this together. I have a wig consult set up this week to prepared for the hair loss. Was the hardest part for me to accept, as my son is being married this July, but I have come to accept it and I am ready to move ahead one day at a time. I have a very supportive husband, family and friends. Also several local ladies in my community that have walked this path before me have been very encouraging as well. Just a slight change in plans for the coming year, but we have a bright future ahead of us!",

Had an education session with one of the nurses and have all of my meds and prescriptions in place and ready to go. Hoping I don't need many if any of them!   Ordered a wig today and have picked up several hats and caps. The lady that did my wig consult was so precious. She has a real heart for what she does as she is a 25 year breast cancer survivor. She has a real ministry helping women with their hair loss.  Found out I will need to have a port for my chemo, so will see surgeon on Thursday to get that scheduled. May not be done for my first treatment, but they said that  using my vein for the first one shouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, my best veins were in my right arm, and now that one is no longer available since my sentinel node biopsy procedure. But I hear that the chemo can be quite hard on your veins, so it is probably the best option anyway.  Hugs to all of you as you begin your chemo!",

But the MO told me that I should be ok to drive to and from all of my treatments, so guess we will see. I am also scheduled for my Look Good Feel Better session after my chemo, so I really hope I feel up to that too!  Wishing all of you the best as you continue your treatments and prepare to get started.

No adverse reactions to any of the pre-meds other than a little drowsiness and feeling a little loopy in the head. They told me the benadryl could make me sleepy. Took about 2 1/2 hours for my first time. I do definitely have the dry metal mouth already. Tried some Biotene dry mouthrinse and that seems to help. Also sucking on mints and chewing gum helps. Not feeling nauseous but they recommended starting my nausea pills first thing today. Drinking lots of fluids to flush my system. I drank 3 bottles of water just during my treatment time. Plus they have you on IV fluids the entire time too. So lots of bathroom trips but if that's the worst I'll take it. Will see how the remainder of the week goes. Taking it one day at a time. I will go back in for blood work and my Neulasta shot today. They have suggested I take Aleve and Claritin right away to counter any bone pain for 2 days following the shot.  My Look Good Feel Better session last night was very enjoyable. There was a great bunch of ladies there at all different stages of their diagnosis and treatment. It was great to be able to connect to them and ask questions among ourselves. Some great makeup pointers, even though I've never worn much makeup and lots of nice free product. Also some great cap and scarf ideas for headcovers. If you haven't signed up for one yet, I would highly recommend it.  Praying that all of you are doing well with your treatments this week!",

I love hearing from the ladies that have walked this path before us. And to hear you were able to keep working full-time is amazing. Makes me realize that maybe this is actually doable. Although I am recently retired at the age of 50, I am active as a band booster officer and help my aging father-in-law quite a bit as well. Hoping that I can continue on with life as normal as possible through all of this.  I enjoyed the day today at my future daughter-in-law's bridal shower. The wedding will be July 12th. Our son(22) is our first child to be married so it is a very exciting time. Love that I have that to look forward to. The wedding is in our hometown, as they are high school sweethearts. They will live in Cincinnati, as they are both UC Students. She will graduate in Nursing this spring, and he has another year ahead of him yet in Electronic Media. I already have my dress, so I am thankful that was already accomplished. We also have a daughter(25) and another son(16).  My mother and daughter are coming with me for the wig consult this week. I have heard very good things from other local ladies that got their wigs at this place in Lima Ohio. One lady said she was at work in the morning, went home for lunch and had her husband shave her head because it was really starting to fall out, then returned to work with her wig and nobody even noticed! Of course, I will know, and I think that is the hardest part to move beyond. But I'm determined to just hold my chin high and keep a positive attitude. I usually get a little shorter cut each spring in anticipation of the hot summer months, so I'm hoping to go a little shorter on the wig. I'm thinking it will be easier to manage.  I have also registered for a Look Good Feel Better Session. It is actually the same day as my first chemo treatment. I'm looking forward to it. Hoping I get some good pointers. I've never been one to wear much makeup, but maybe I will do a little more just to make myself feel better. There will be plenty of extra time, since the hair styling time will be nixed. Let's all keep looking forward to our bright futures!",

Overall, my week went pretty well, other than I developed a head cold by Thursday. No fever though, and no nausea. Not a huge appetite the first few days but was still able to eat a little at a time. My nurses told me to go ahead and take my nausea medications starting the morning after chemo for a few days. So thankful I did, as I think that is what helped prevent any major nausea for me. Also had my Neulasta shot the day after chemo. They told me to take Claritin and Aleve for 2 days after the shot to help with any bone pain. Can't say that I had any bone pain at all. So thankful they have these preventative options to stay ahead of these side effects. I have also been pouring down the water each day. They say that is very important to help flush your system. By Wed. night and most of Thursday, I was just extra tired. Napped off and on through the day Thursday and just took it easy. Was able to take a short walk Thursday evening, and then on Friday resumed my morning 2 mile walks. Now I wasn't exactly power walking, but it was great to get back to walking. I think that really helped how I was feeling too. I returned to the Dr.'s office on Monday to have blood work, and my white cells were too low, so had to get a Neupogen shot. They told me to return on Tues and Wed again for another shot, then this Thursday they will do blood work again to see if my white cells are back up yet. Hoping to get back up to where I need to be by next Monday for my round 2 of AC. I will have my port put in tomorrow morning. Sure hoping I recover quickly from that too so I'm ready for Monday.  Thinking of all of you as we make this journey together. Just keep taking one day at a time. And let your family and friends pamper you through it all. You deserve it!",

Managed the nausea pretty well with meds, but the appetite was just not there for several days, had to force myself to eat. Also my cycle decided to come on strong that week and I think it compounded my tiredness this round. I'm guessing I won't have many more of those, as the chemo is most likely going to put me into menopause. It's time anyway since I'm not 51! By the weekend I was starting to feel more normal and get some energy back. So my husband took be out to see the Disney documentary film on Bears Saturday night. It was really wonderful, and I highly recommend it. Then we got some groceries and grabbed a sandwich together. On Sunday, I was feeling almost like myself again. However, my dear husband woke up to a severe Pancreatitis attack. So, I had to take him to the hospital and they ended up admitting him. He just came home today, Wednesday. Not exactly good timing, but thankfully it was my off week from treatment, so I could spend my time with him at the hospital. So glad to have him back home and able to enjoy a few good days before AC #3.  To top that off, by Saturday and Sunday my hair was coming out in bunches. So on Monday morning I called my wig consultant and said it was time for my shave. She got me right in that morning right away. My Mom took me. Got all my tears out before we went. Actually when it was done, I was very relieved to put it behind me and just move on. I have a wig and lots of hats and caps. Even have a nice hat rack on my bedroom closet door to keep them all organized. She also trimmed up my wig once I had it on without my hair and I was very happy with it. I'm not sure how much I will wear it, but I knew I needed to have one for my son's wedding in July. And as happy as I am with it, I'll probably wear it more than I thought I would.  Later in the evening on Monday, while I was visiting my husband at the hospital, I had a message from my sister-in-law. She sent me a picture of her son's girlfriend showing me that in honor of me losing my hair that day, she had donated 12 inches of her beautiful red hair to Locks of Love that very day! What a sweetheart! I told her that maybe my hair will come back in red in honor of her!  Praying for strength for all of you as you continue your treatments!",

It was the first one with my port, which was much easier I must day. No bruising on the hand from the IV anymore! Yeah! I came home with what I call my loopy head feeling and slept most of the rest of the afternoon. But was able to enjoy supper and no major nausea. Restless sleep overnight, but got some Z's here and there. Took my nausea meds in the morning as recommended just to stay ahead of any that may come. Energy level is low, but was able to eat lightly and not so much of the metal taste this time around. Hoping this continues, as I am so thankful for the minimal side effects. I'm off to the office to get my Neulasta shot now. Hair is still hanging on, but beginning to feel lifeless to me. My GI Joe cut may be soon.  Sending hugs to all of you. ",
