I think I want to lock them in a cave until they come back to human form. I don't think my kids care about what I'm going through. They're 13 years old and I know that puberty is a wierd time for a kid but they've got to cut me some slack. There's nobody to take care of me, only me taking care of everybody else. Seems unfair given my state of health. But my family doesn't think twice about it. I've always been and will alway be SUPERWOMAN! Sorry to change the subject of this thread in mid stream but life is so complicated right now. My kids talk back, slam doors, stomp their feet and act like little three year olds. I took them to chemo treatment yesterday thinking that if they visually saw what I went through they would be compassionate, but NO... they fought in the the infusion room over the FREAKIN TV! I'm so pissed right now. I think they're ungrateful brats and It's all my fault. I've always but them first and they know it and now they expect it no matter what. I don't want the rest of my life to be all about giving them what they want and no one considering my feels, fears and needs. I had to ask my son to hug me yesterday after chemo and he said, \"Mom I'm so sorry, I didn't know you went through this every week\". That compassion lasted until we got to the car and voted on where to have dinner. A fight lasted for 2 hours dinner was awful and play refree the whole time. I barely made it through dinner and got just enough energy to climb in bed. Well so much for \"As the World Turns\" but this is a day in the life of single mama with drama! Emmy award winner drama. I think I'm about to lose it.... Do they make pink straight jackets? God is able, Boobbuster",

I lost all my hair over night. It's super thin now. Oh well. It'll grow back. Carol also, I stoped taking the decadron and only take what they give me before chemo infusions. I've got the round face too. I feel like a BLOWFISH. I had to go to the hospital last week for mouth sores. They gave me miracle mouthwash that really helped. Any ways, just wanted to say hello and check in on my homegirls. Stay sweet and talk to you soon! Stephanie",

I thought I was just dealing with lung mets; but this is a totally new deck of cards. Is any one else dealing with anything like this? God is able, Stephanie Log in to post a reply",
