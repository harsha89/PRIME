I was supposed to get my biopsy last Friday because they found a hot spot on the BSGI. Now I have a MRI scheduled for next Tues and the Biopsy next Friday. I hate the wait. I have a great Dr. so that helps but it's the wait that's hard. They said they could not confirm if I had 2 spots of concern or it was the same spot they were seeing twice. I hope you are doing well.
