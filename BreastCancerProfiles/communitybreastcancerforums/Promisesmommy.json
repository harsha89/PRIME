Very fatigued, mind in a fog, and there are times I just can't even get off the couch. Blood work normal. I am 4'11\u201d normally like 105 lbs. I am now 87 lbs and can't keep weight on. After tracking my eating habits, I'm eating close to 2800 calories a day, healthy foods, and following the carbs, fat, protein and such to make sure I'm getting enough of each. I do get shooting pains from that breast into my arm pit for about 6 months now periodically. Just a few days ago, I found a lump in my R breast. My breasts aren't huge and I check them regularly. I've had kids so I know what a plugged milk duct feels like, I know the normal tissue feeling like the back of my hand. But this is different. There's no particular shape. It's hard. Doesn't hurt. About the size of a grape I would say. To be sure.. I had my husband feel it, and he said it most definitely does feel hard and not like my normal breast tissue and just doesn't feel normal I was told to go to a gynocologist by a friend. Is that the right place to go? I don't have a GP, as I just moved to a new area. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
