I'm starting the road to chemo on January 6th, with the 6 treatment regiment. After reading so many of your experience's, I feel I'm equipped for battle. I'm going to CVS to buy the Claritan, Benedryl, Biotene, Ginger capsules, etc.  It has been re-assuring knowing what to expect, it takes the edge off.   I'm the only one of all my friends with breast cancer, so there isn't anyone I can compare notes with.  Having found this site and reading what everyone wrote, has been a blessing.   Wishing everyone a Healthy, Happy New Year Log in to post a reply",
