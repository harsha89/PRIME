Is this a regional difference I wonder.  I'm from ontario and my RO says no creams at all. Could people chip in with their RO's recommendations and a general location? If that's ok?",

Also lost the bra at week 3, I wore men's sleeveless undershirts 1 size too small for the rest of it. It didn't support them but it kept my boobs from wobbling. 3 Week Post Rads Update My breast is almost normal again. Still burnt and raw underneath but getting better everyday. I was able to wear a bra again this week, but I am still using sports bras as I am afraid the under wire will dig in. Energy level is getting a tiny bit better.

By then I had switched from the Glaxal base lotion to the cream. I found it eliminated the friction better thus allowing my body to continue healing. It's thicker and hung around a lot longer too, without wrecking my clothes. Totally topless is the best, no creams or lotions at all, but it disconcerts people at the mall. lol Hope your appointment goes well, we'll be there for you. Hugs.",

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2014 01:14PM - edited Feb 11, 2014 01:16PM by RedReading Hi there. OK so CT Simulation today and appointment with my RO. I had about 40 questions. He started off talking, but I would pause him to write the answer beside the question he'd already answered without me asking. Eventually he was just quiet and I started in on my questions. He was great, answered everything concisely. Then time for the simulation. These women have me in the most contorted position. Turns out my buppies like to visit my armpit and my neck when they are prone. Lol. So I have to squooch this and elevate that and duck that shoulder and ABOVE ALL relax!  They lied to me - they said the tats wouldn't hurt. I'm terrified of needles so the student does the first one and I am keening through it all - took about half a minute. The therapist says nope she needs it fast and rammed through the rest in about 14 seconds. I cried, then felt stupid. I'm lucky, I get the Cdn protocol, so only 16 + 4 boosts. I'm so happy. So now I wait for the phone call that says okay cummon in for your rads. Only question I didn't ask, because I didn't know to was... I'm already at 11 weeks, (don't ask - it was a disaster) and rads won't start for 2 more so I'm outside the 16 weeks with the 4 wks of rads. Is that how it's counted? Or do you have to start within 16 weeks.  Thanks. Have a nice evening. ",

The only part you are missing is that some of us have been known to enjoy a glass of wine or a beer. I have frequently heard the clinking of glasses and way to much laughter coming from my pockets. Lol. And they leave my pockets messy sometimes, but Kim taught me the secret - twirl around and poof, your pockets are clean again. You're totally right about the hugs, love and smiles though. And I know I feel more peaceful knowing my sisters are in my pocket whenever I have a big appointment or I'm scared or depressed. It's good to know you're not alone. O and we go on vacations together too. The one who is going takes an over the door shoe holder, so we each have our own little space. ;-) My first treatment was good. Not as quick as yours but pretty quick. Other than the tingling, I didn't feel anything. And I'm not at all pink or anything, but I didn't expect to be either.  As far as Kentucky goes, the first 2 times I was there, I had misfortunes. A car accident once (black ice) with about 40 other cars - strangely none of us hit each other, just ditches and road barriers and in our case the bottom of a bridge, backwards. The second time, the muffler fell off my car. I had determined not to go back at that point. But some friends were going down to golf and we thought ok. We had a great time. Last time was even better, the people were so nice and friendly, offering to show us around, recommending restaurants, it was super. That time we were just tourists! Had a blast! About the appointments, I mis-spoke yesterday. First, I am 16+4 not 15+5. And second, when I looked at my schedule, I was appalled. They were all over the place, I'd never remember and it would really inconvenience work because they'd never be sure when I was going to be there and when I wasn't. So after my appt I sat down with the secretary. She not only changed my appts but the RO's too so they meshed with my new schedule. I get Rads every day at 3:00pm then go home. Except for once a week when I see my RO after my appt. My thanks to her for helping me work out a better schedule. Well, I've written a book here. Better go have my bath and crawl into my beddy bye. Nite nite all.",

Sorry to be a wet blanket, but rads are not going so good for me any more.  I'm in the darned stirrups for 40/45 mins each day for rads. I have gone so far off the planning that I have had many days of... take an xray adjust me, take an xray adjust me... that I could spit. Usually they do this 6-8 times, then, I get treatment. Wednesday, they tried a 360 xray, my planner was present for this, but the machine rejected me. Thursday, they had a medical physicist in the room - she of course, cared about the machinery, not the patient, and fixed things up so that they could do the 360. After lying there another 10 mins, still in the stupid stirrups, they came in and told me they couldn't do a treatment today. No big deal, they said, we'll just tack one on to the end! Friday, my RO was in the room, and they managed after multiple attempts to get me to the point where they could do treatment.  I went from there to the cardiologists, where they hooked me up with a heart monitor for the weekend. Got home and realized when I went to change that they'd hooked 1/2 above my bra and 1/2 the leads below it. Usually this may be no problem, but I was wearing a sports bra that had to come off over my head. Idiots. I had to disconnect 4 leads to get my bra off. I'm not positive I put them back on right. Sigh. I have trouble with black and navy sometimes.  OK so tomorrow, they are going to try again, and it's my RO appt right after. So I'm taking my DH and my DD the RPN with me. Maybe I can get some answers that way. Hugs'n'kisses.  Deb",

That is what you have - a really bad sunburn on just one area of your body! And the sunburn goes inside too, just to make things worse. Inside you can get zingers, stationary pain and your nerves are still trying to repair themselves after surgery.  It's no wonder you feel like heck! Some people seem to sail thru it but most don't. Cut yourselves some slack girls. You're doing fine. Sleep when you need to. You need to heal and the urge does finally subside. {{{{huggles}}}",

The cherry blossoms have burst into life there, and daffodils, crocuses and tulips are a foot high or more. It is, however, good to be home. To see my furbabies and my kids. To sleep in my own bed, bathe in my own tub. MinusTwo, how long has this fever been going on? Seems to me it is 5 or 6 days now??!! I could be wrong, my sense of time is off because of the trip. But if it is 5 or 6 days I think you need to see your primary care giver, not an RO or MO. Constant fever is your body's way if combating an infection of some sort. Lung, UTI, whatever. It's trying to burn it up. But at the same time, it depletes your body's resources and you need those now. I stick by what I said about sunburns. They bring on chills, fever, tummy upsets and sometimes diarrhea. I know, I've had a bunch as a redhead. And you have a whale of a sunburn on your breast right now. But you still need all the resources your body can give you and at this point (if my time sense is correct) you might be better with your regular doc, than with a specialist. {{{hugs}}} Mimi and Mayanne, I'm still shedding my skin like I was a sweater. Lol. I can add that in addition to my under breast area I now have little rolled up balls of skin in my armpit as well. Ewww. TB90, congrats on finishing rads. I hope that all of your issues are minor ones. ((((TB)))) Andrea, I asked my RO about cream in advance and in his erudite opinion, it wouldn't help and could hurt. The cream acts as an intensifyer for the rads. Anyway that's what he said. So no creams for me until week 3. Then once a day till week 4 then as much as I wanted to use. Strangely enough, I still have all the same SE's as everyone else, so I'm not sure it matters one little bit! Mayanne, as soon as I read your post, I checked my lizard nipple. Nope no cracks or splits. Thank goodness. Although I'm sorry you're going through that. LilyLuv, hugs to you sweetie. Sorry about that post rad 3 week reaction! What's up with that? Darn. I so don't want to deal with that. I'm back to work full time next week. OK, I've pretty much written a book here, so I'll sign off now. Hugs'n'kisses  Deb",

I said, certainly. Into the car and we drove and drove and drove. Finally, I said, where is this burger? He replied, Cambridge (about 20 miles away) and continued driving. Once in Cambridge he drove up and down little side streets forever it seemed until I said, where are we going? He replied, it has to be around here somewhere, and gave me the address. I found the place, townhouses. Hmmmm. O good, he says, and jumps out of the car, runs over to one of the townhouses and knocks.

It seems to be doing its job though, so no complaints in that department either. Lojo, I definitely understand what they are doing with you. I always start out with, o this ain't so bad, then as things stiffen up, I'm more like, when will this end. Lol hey, you're more than 1/2 way now. JM, I have had no experience with 'rad cough' than goodness. I hope they give you something to make it go away because I think it would be awful to have to hold in a cough while getting rads.

The skin below my breast started crumbling off. That's the best description I can think of. It is coming off in a series of very small rolled up balls of skin. It seems okay underneath though.

So, to answer those questions I can... JM, it turns out that 360 xray they did was a new CT, my breast shape and size remains the same. The plan did have to change tho, they had 1 cm (almost 1/2 inch) play in the original plan, but I had gone outside that -from 94.6 to 95.3, so they had to figure out a slightly different way of positioning me. And only 1 arm is in the stirrups. TeamKim, my DH & DD were both good with the answers the RO provided, and better yet, he didn't make me feel like an idiot for asking. They also gave me Glaxal Base to use, but I'm thinking now I have the go-ahead for a cream/lotion, I might use a natural product I have instead of it. The ingredients are similar but one has things like Ceteareth-20 and p-Chloro-m-Cresol while the other has Tulips and ginger oil and such. What do you think? Minus Two, I also get seen by my RO on a weekly basis. I kind of wish it wasn't on a Monday, because I heal pretty well over the weekend usually. Both mentally and physically. So I tend to answer the survey with, o I feel good, tired and a bit sore but good.  Mayanne and Mimi, there are two stirrups on my right side. They lift my arm up above my head at 9\" high, bicep and 11\" forearm. My hand kind of hangs. I am on an inclined plane with a bum rest (to keep me from sliding off the table) a knee rest, and a piece of concrete under my neck. OK it's not concrete, but it sure feels like it after a while. My head kind of hangs like my hand. My left hand has to be anchored under my butt. It wasn't so bad when it was only 10 mins, but when the time kept extending, it all burns - all the contact points.  TB, turns out guys are in a very similar position to us. Flat in their backs with their hands on their chest. The biggest difference is that they get their rads while the machine is moving in an arc around them. That way, the focal point (prostate) gets rads constantly while the remaining areas get less as the beam is always in motion over them. Pretty cool, eh? PositiveNegative, I think I'll try the Tylenol idea. I wonder though if ibuprofen might be better in my case since it is the muscles that stiffen and start shaking. This is partially why my plan went off. And the longer and longer the arranging went on the tenser I got and the further off plan I went. I don't have LE (yet & never I hope) so no LE sleeve. Anyway, I feel better now. I understand it better and that makes a world of difference. Thanks to you all for supporting me during a really tough weekend. Hugs'n'kisses ",

I'm not happy, I am not sad, I am not even scared. I have not cried, I have not ranted and raved. I don't feel mad at the world. I am kind of resigned. In my head I have already heard the dx and know it isn't good. So... From this state of numbness I have still achieved something that I truly appreciate. My hubby has been having chest pains and numbness in his arm and lips. But refused to see a doctor about it.  So. I asked him if he would rather we not go to the appt tomorrow. If he thought maybe it would be better not to know for sure. Just live our lives until they're done. I'm 56 so I've done a fair bit of living. Maybe we should just coast... He truly did consider it. Then he emphatically denied it would be a good idea. Long story short, he is calling the doctor on Tuesday for an appt. Thank you thank you thank you. In the meantime I realize this is my brain's way of coping. But it kind of hurts inside to have no feelings about this. I am scared of when the flood of emotion that I fully expect will occur. Will I be at work? In my car? At dinner with my kids? If I had a wish t would be in the middle of the night, in my bed, with my hubby to hold me. Ok just reread this - boy am I depressing.

Pipers, my DD is considering giving hers up again. How do you feel about being a brunette? Lol. Hers grows so fast, she gives it up every couple years, 12\" at a time. I am so jealous. June, I'm so happy you are drain-free. It must feel so good. Do let us know the results of your scan. What exactly is a PET scan tho? Sorry, I'm not familiar with the term.

      "Content": "Jan 26, 2014 04:31PM RedReading wrote: Hello ladies. I'm baaaaaaack. (as Arnie would say). First - an update. Got home from work on Friday 17th at about 5pm and isn't there a message from the MO saying I had an appt at 9am Monday. Of course, the Cancer Centre is closed so I had almost no way to contact her and say I'll be on vacation. I did leave a message with the family history lady (her's was the only Ext # I knew), so hopefully she didn't think I was just blowing her off. Second - Vacation. I had lovely time, my DH, not so much! Showed up at the airport on Saturday at 4am and we showed our passports and checked our luggage when they realized his passport had expired. They were very calm - sir, you need to go home and get the right passport, ma'am, you need to get on the plane because your luggage is already there. We will send your husband on the next plane. Well of course he never found it, so now he has to wait until Monday and go to emergency immigration to get a new passport. But first - he has to find his birth certificate - guess what? Can't find that either. Probably with his passport, which he used when he went to Tennessee golfing in April. So the upshot was, $475 for a flight in, $230 for an emergency passport and $50 for an emergency birth certificate. All of which depended on each other and he needed guarantors for everything. Our dentist guaranteed him for the birth certificate, our neighbours for the passport and his old friend verified the passport photo and all of them called in to the appropriate office and scanned their approvals so he could join me. Tuesday night at 9:40pm his plane touched down and I was waiting when he walked out of the airport. Yay - he had finally arrived. While I waited for him for 4 days, I took archery lessons (probably would have been easier if I'd had a mastectomy - I know, very dark sense of humour), walked the beach a lot and made friends with every child under the age of 13 on the resort. As we were getting on the plane to come home, one little girl asked her dad if it was okay if they took me home with them. lol Once he arrived, we walked on the beach a lot, went to a farmers market, took a horse and buggy ride and partied every night like we were 20. O my aching head. Third - welcome to KLJ - o dear, it was on the last page so if I got the initials wrong, sorry. We have all felt that empty void inside that just seems to leave us with emotions we aren't used to feeling and reactions to things that are alien to our normal sense of wellbeing. I am sorry you are facing this, but glad you found us! We have shared our journey since the beginning and we have also shared advice, comfort and happy moments. Some recipes, some alternate med information, some serious meltdowns and some serious joy. Pipers' dancing made me grin and Jodi's facebook page made me happy too. We each get through this our own way as we are all so different. Damn my screen is jumping better post and then finish what I was saying. (((hugs)))",

Thanks for the advice. Jodi, good luck for the scans. June is right, exercise really does help with SE's. I know with three little ones, you probably get tons of a certain type of exercise but the walks are never brisk are they? lol. I found Melatonin was helpful to get to sleep, but upon reading more, I discovered that Melatonin is sensitive to light and switches off if exposed to it. It does seem to work better in the pitch black. For the night sweats, I am on Gabapentin and Effexor. My OB/Gyn recommended it and my MO approved it. Again it seems to help somewhat too, although the best thing I've found so far is a small fan on my bedside table that I can roll toward when sweat starts raining from my body. lol  June, you recently moved and such didn't you? Did you get your apartment all set up to your liking? I know it was a little while ago, but my memory is shot and I don't remember things the way I used to.

Good idea, where good became great for me was when she said to send my hair to have a wig made for me! Out if my own hair. I'm used to it, I like it and I'll be more comfortable wearing a wig that looks and feels like me. Can you do that if you wanted to? We had a busy Christmas as well, with 5 kids plus spouses, 11 grandkids (and their spouses, omg) and 1 of my 2 great-grandbabies. Lots of food, laughter and games. So Lulu has 10 little teeth happening? Awww. So cute. Can't wait to see a picture. Hi June, how did Christmas go with your sis? Did you take it easy or was it go, go, go? Are your drains out yet? I think I recall you saying that they would possibly be coming out last Monday.  Pipers, all of the wonderful things you mentioned would be great, if only our DH would do that pampering. A 2 minute back rub while I'm standing with my hands in the dishwater is much more likely. And even that is appreciated.   Well, I'm at work so I guess I should stop chatting with you girls. Hope everyone gets to wind down this weekend. Hugs'n'kisses  ",

The results showed that each package, if consumed entirely, contained at least double the minimum lethal dosage of cyanide for an adult human. The apricot pits were recalled and removed from stores. Be careful how many you eat sweetie. Piper, I'm depressed enough lately to have actually told my doc about it. That's a first for me. He has recommended counselling. I've never heard of the 'Cancer Personality', what is it? Also, what is GABA? Sorry you're going through a rough time right now. (((Pipers))) Jodi, only a few more weeks till Scan result day right? Hope all goes well honey. How are your 3 adorable little ones? Any new pics? June, Pipers is right - how are you doing? You never say! Come on, spill it, we want it all. lol Also, I think we lost Tracy because there were a few days till we answered her post. Maybe she decided to go for a more active site. Hugs'n'kisses to you all.

Concern over you would lessen her grief over your dad a bit, but she also probably felt very overwhelmed at so many things beyond her control happening to her family. Either way, you are both beyond that point now and celebrating the coveted NED! Congrats! Nice also to hear that you are back in LA, although I wish all of you lived closer since I would really like to meet you all. June is in NYC, Pipers in MO, you in LA and I'm in southern Ontario. NYC is a 15 hour drive, LA a 6 hour plane ride and, MO is about a 13 hour drive - kind of looks like Pipers is in the middle, maybe we'll all meet at your house one day. Pipers, I watched the video you posted and am going to give it a try. I will need to watch it again though, just to get it all down correctly. I also sent it to my DD who has been racking up diplomas and certification in the last 2 years. She is a disabled nurse practitioner who, after her fall and broken back 4 years ago, is now also .... a qualified herbalist, a master Reiki teacher, a certified crystal healer and several other things. I thought she would find this of interest in her quest to become a holistic healer. Each Sunday of the new moon she does a distance healing at 9pm EST. Although she always includes my BCO friends in general, she can send more specific healing if you give permission, then all you do is sit quietly for 15 mins at that time. PM me if you would like more info. That goes for Jodi and June and New as well. June, is it possible that your lack of emotions right now is the very thing you need EFT for? Or perhaps the fact that work is sucking out all of your energy? I really, really do understand and if you doubt it, go to the top of the page and reread the paragraph that I wrote to start this thread. You work for a Cdn company? Can I ask which one? Thanksgiving at my home is a ton of family members, ham, turkey, stuffing, mashed cheesy potatoes, squash, peas, beans, brussel sprouts or asperagus covered in cheese, and this year, 5 different types of pie with ice cream and cool whip.  New, I hope you didn't take my comments as criticism. We all made a deal, long ago, to be totally honest with each other and to try to help as  much as possible. I'm very glad we did because we have all said some things on this thread that we probably haven't told others in our quest not to worry family and friends.  So, okay, now we're down to me. Unfortunately, I did not get the coveted NED. On the other hand, I also did not get the 'go back for more surgery' either. I am on a 6 week watch as they have found another lump. Damn it. They don't know what kind of lump though, since it is fairly close to where the last one was. So more tests to find out if it is a water or calcium deposit or something equally B9. Hopefully, it is. I had my heart set on an NED without even realizing it and it is amazing how crushed and kind of betrayed I felt. Ended up calling my PCP who has recommended..... drum roll please ..... therapy! Ok, so that's now 3 of us who have been there June, don't feel at all bad if you call for help. That's all the news for today, so I'll sign off for now, but not before wishing you all the very best of everything your heart desires.  Hugs'n'kisses, Deb",

Ok so a stupid 'that sucks' moment was when I realized that my surgery is only 4 days before the Pink concert. I stood in line for those tickets, back in February.

You can get into those things like thanksgiving dinner. Your sad day may have been really good for you. I hope so. Jodi, whats happening?  I know you had your op, but haven't heard from you since. I hope you are ok. Robin, thanks for the advice. I'll look it up. Bag It. Got it. Lol Welcome Trinity, well not really since i'm sure you would rather never to have needed to find us.

Come whenever you get nervous or need info or just want to chat/rant/complain whatever. We're here for you. So, my doctor gave me something to help me sleep again as i haven't done much of that in the last 10 days. I'm so tired. Better still, he also gave me something to take on the morning of my op, so i wouldn't run screaming from the needles. Lol. My work is being super supportive and im finding it easier to tell people now. They were actually joking about Debbie Goes Amazon at lunch today. I said i had told my mom that i was thinking of taking up archery. The table cracked up so i think they are all hoping for the best for me and trying to keep my spirits up. But gosh, its sometimes really hard to stay positive. Other than the needle fear i'm still numb. I don't like it. I'm a pretty emotional person and this is sooo not me. Maybe my new nickname should be limbo lady. Cuz I'm living there now. :-(   ",

Although I admit to some of the same thoughts myself. My DH and I are planning to take 3 vacations next year, Cuba in Feb, Italy in June and Scotland in Sept. We've been saving for retirement forever, I'm 56, and we said what are we doing? We have money saved up, and I get bc. We may not be here in 5 years so we're going to live like we're retired. Lol In the meantime, what pre-op tests and what needle for lymph nodes the day before? My surgery was pretty quick and there was no pre anything. Went in, got freezing in my poor boob, had the locator hook put in, had the radioactive stuff put in the nipple area, got a really cool radioactive xray, had a guy write X's on me, then op room and sleepy time. Woke up with lots of bandages, red iodine stains and a blue nipple. Bye bye go home. See you in three weeks. Rads in January. So are they splitting yours surgery into bits? Or do you have to have stuff I didn't have? You don't have to answer if you don't want to. I will understand. And if it makes you feel any better about work, we just got bought by a multinational, so are going through a name change, culture change etc. Everyone stays on but all the jobs are changing. O and we are going live with SAP April first, so I do understand deadlines and the pressures. And the exhilaration too. :-)",

I'm not happy, I am not sad, I am not even scared. I have not cried, I have not ranted and raved. I don't feel mad at the world. I am kind of resigned. In my head I have already heard the dx and know it isn't good. So... From this state of numbness I have still achieved something that I truly appreciate. My hubby has been having chest pains and numbness in his arm and lips. But refused to see a doctor about it.  So. I asked him if he would rather we not go to the appt tomorrow. If he thought maybe it would be better not to know for sure. Just live our lives until they're done. I'm 56 so I've done a fair bit of living. Maybe we should just coast... He truly did consider it. Then he emphatically denied it would be a good idea. Long story short, he is calling the doctor on Tuesday for an appt. Thank you thank you thank you. In the meantime I realize this is my brain's way of coping. But it kind of hurts inside to have no feelings about this. I am scared of when the flood of emotion that I fully expect will occur. Will I be at work? In my car? At dinner with my kids? If I had a wish t would be in the middle of the night, in my bed, with my hubby to hold me. Ok just reread this - boy am I depressing.

Just when I thought I'd seen the last of you fade off the video, you'd pop up with another fellow. Lucky girl!   I looked into alternative medicines too. My bff brought me Native Tea (essiac) which I was drinking right up until I found out it was loaded with hormones. Be careful that what you eat and drink doesn't contain a lot of hormones. My husband is mostly my rock and occasionally a thorn in my side. Lol. He tries, but for some reason, his ultra sunny attitude can get on my nerves sometimes. Then I feel like yelling 'don't you get it? I have cancer. I need to be irradiated. I might need chemo. My hair will fall out, maybe my nails. It isn't over just because I had surgery'. Sigh. He told me yesterday he was happy because it was gone. I get it, but gee... Also Pipers, I've told a ton of people now, but not on FB. One or two girls figured out something was off and im'ed me, but that kind of general knowledge I don't do. Jodi, Pipers is right, your cancer is a bitch and if I could help you kick it to the curb I would. Maybe those Duck Dynasty guys could help me. They look burly.  Speaking of triggers, guess who was on hormones for the last two years? Yup, that'd be me. I didn't know anything about it. Read one article debunking the concept that hormones cause bc and went with that.  Sorry about your hair loss, does your kind of chemo hit the nails too? Back on day 1, when I was still cocky and confident I met a woman who had that happen. I fluffed it off cuz of course nothing like that was going to happen to me!!!! I didn't have bc, just a spot that worried the docs. June I am also still yoyoing on the chemo for all the same reasons you are. My immune system is actually doing a really great job right now. Haven't even caught the sniffles since all this began. Knock on wood.  And now for the great news. Drumroll please...... had to cancel my Feb vacation plans because it will fall into chemo, rads, etc time. So I looked at the calendar and said well, not doing anything for 3 weeks (till my BRCA2 comes back) and 2 weeks from now isn't month end or payroll... Looked online, called my DD, can you house and pet sit? Yes! Called my boss, can I have the time? Yes! Booked a trip to the Caribbean. YES!!!!!!!!! So you are now talking to one happy camper! ",

But.... Pipers, June and Jodi, I have a problem with all these diets so I just have been staying out of the convos a bit. I did research the ones yiu mentioned tho. Pipers, the ketogenic diet calls for flax seed and a number of other things that are really high in estrogen. My advice from the dietician was to steer clear of those things. My MO even gave me the max amounts of flax, primrose, Oregano oil, etc, that I'm allowed to take. And it wasn't much. Free range chickens are great but are the grains they are eating hormone free or was it bought as disease resistant strain? Those have hormones. Cows the same question and the same inquiry. I am all for us ladies trying to be as healthy as we can be under the circumstances. Fasting scares me cuz I figure my poor body needs as much help as it can get to fight against this RB. I want my immune system at the top of its game not wondering where it's nourishment has gone. I'm not very hungry right now, so I guess it's not even appropriate for me to talk about diets. But, please think it through from one end to the other before embarking on a diet.  OK lecture over. Aren't I a bundle of laughs? Sorry, ladies, now you know why I have been reticent with my replies. Kinda feels good to tell u though, like I can talk about other stuff again.  So, my hubby bought me a Ho! Came home last week and he said he was on the Shopping Channel. My cue to say how much and what did you buy me? He said two hundred mumble mumble dollars and he bought me a Ho. I said she better be good for that kind of cash.  It's actually an electrical stimulation unit that massages you for 15 second the zaps you with unbelievably intense electricity for 5.  I'm thinking of putting parental controls on the Shopping Channel.

I carry that with me always.  I have done a lot of research on hormone injection and it's not good for us, I realize that. It wasn't really industrialization that started it though. Believe it or not it was WW2. All the men went off to war, women went to work, and there were very few people left to farm. When the men came home, there was a food crisis in the US and Canada. Until a scientist tried hormones as a temporary measure. It worked, producing bigger chickens and cows with more meat on them. It was supposed to be discontinued but then the baby boom came along and we needed even more meat. About this time full blown industrialization came into play. The machinery for processing food was all made for bigger chickens and bigger cows. They tried to go backwards about a decade ago. Eliminated hormones and got smaller chickens - 5-6 lbs instead of 8-9 lbs. But the machinery couldn't handle it - it was a disaster. Parts that shouldn't be in our diet suddenly were because the tools to grab a chicken were never made to grab a small chicken and strip it etc. Now we need to make the machinery smaller. Our countries have too many people now to have everyone eating free range anything. We don't have the grazing space, and what we do have has been given over to condos and farmers are being paid to grow nothing. It rots my socks! I'm glad you've found a source for good food. I have too. About the drinking, I'm not going to fuss. I rarely do moderation on anything. Kind of a full speed ahead kind of girl. I did tell my doc that I like my beer, so she can adjust the meds accordingly.  Anyway, thanks again for the book reference.  Hugs'n'kisses  Deb ",

You have a nice way with words and I was happy with the positive direction your posts are taking. I also read that article you told me about on ewg.org? I don't recall the web name properly. Sorry. It was less informative. It only said here's good stuff, here's bad stuff. It didn't explain, to my satisfaction, why it had divided the fruits and veggies that way. I'll keep researching tho, thanks for the tip. Pipers, there is no right or wrong way to approach bc. Please don't feel that you can't chat with us about your journey as it has obviously sparked both June and I to look into alternative therapies more carefully. I have found a family farm nearby that has grass fed beef, which is great cuz I loves me my beef! lol. They also have free range chickens. Now I just need to find out where they got their grass seed and what kind of food their chickens are eating. Each time I think I have this decided my son asks another question. He'll say, okay mom, so they are grass fed - was the grass originally a variety that is GMO or hormone laden? Then it's back to the research  and  I'm back on the computer again. He is a fish farmer specializing in Talapia, so he has done all kinds of research on healthy water, food and energy consumption. My daughter is a little further out there, she's what I would call a kitchen witch. She grows all of her own herbs, most of her own veggies and does it all on a little plot of land that is about 8'x10' that she calls her backyard. She also believes in almost all things pagan and a lot of things conventional. She believes in God, but tends toward Gaia, she believes in spirituality rather than religion, she meditates and does yoga. The pagan part comes up at the funniest times, like today, when I loaned her my car to do some running around this afternoon. Last thing she said as she dropped me back at my place was Happy Imbolc Eve. O and mom, today is the best day of the year to plant seeds if you intend to do that. Of course I do. So I will take her advice and plant my seeds this afternoon. She is also a board certified nurse, has an herbology degree and is a practicing Reiki healer and she is disabled. It's funny, I'm an accountant and my hubby was a consultant for Jeep and yet we managed to raise another accountant, a beautiful girl who has her hands totally full looking after an Autistic son, a stay at home mom, a totally holistic healer and a fish farmer. Who would have thought it. Life is strange sometimes. Have a great day! Deb ",

And there is nobody on this thread who thinks that you are taking the wrong path to health. It doesn't work for me but I sure am eating healthier because of advice you and Jodi and June have given me. I think it really helps me. Salmon twice a week now, less dairy (can't give up on cheese), less red meat, more veggies. I've also started taking calcium and vitamin D, and Omega. My buddy, who is a holistic healer says to add more vitamin C to my diet because I'm a smoker. Sorry folks, my dirty little secret is now out there. I'm cutting back but I've been smoking for 44 years now and it's really tough to quit. My DD, who is a Reiki master says that exercise will really help too, so I've joined a gym. So far, I'm only going twice a week, but I hope to step that up a bit.  Nobody here has anything but love for you Pipers.

TE yes, even artificial like silicone but not tummy tissue. That's cool. No saline injections or anything. Neat. Zero chance of rejection either. It's amazing what they can do now isn't it? My mom came down. Today to see me and she said the same. She had a mastectomy 10 years ago and she is astounded that I was up and around today.

It's no wonder that you're on an emotional seesaw,   with tears and anger and numbness. I totally get it. Looks like you made a good choice with the bmx. Glad you seen to be in good spirits. I think a positive outlook can only help. Sorry you'll have to be away from the family for a bit, but I'm quite sure they want their mom with them for a long time. So a bit of missing them will give them a gift they can celebrate for years. Keep in touch and let us know what's going on. Hey, you ever hear of the Urban Dictionary? In it you vote for the word and definitions. One of the girls on one of these sites coined the term FURB. It means F U Rat Ba$tard meaning breast cancer (or really any kind. It's #2 right now.

I'm not happy, I am not sad, I am not even scared. I have not cried, I have not ranted and raved. I don't feel mad at the world. I am kind of resigned. In my head I have already heard the dx and know it isn't good. So... From this state of numbness I have still achieved something that I truly appreciate. My hubby has been having chest pains and numbness in his arm and lips. But refused to see a doctor about it.  So. I asked him if he would rather we not go to the appt tomorrow. If he thought maybe it would be better not to know for sure. Just live our lives until they're done. I'm 56 so I've done a fair bit of living. Maybe we should just coast... He truly did consider it. Then he emphatically denied it would be a good idea. Long story short, he is calling the doctor on Tuesday for an appt. Thank you thank you thank you. In the meantime I realize this is my brain's way of coping. But it kind of hurts inside to have no feelings about this. I am scared of when the flood of emotion that I fully expect will occur. Will I be at work? In my car? At dinner with my kids? If I had a wish t would be in the middle of the night, in my bed, with my hubby to hold me. Ok just reread this - boy am I depressing.

They are also pushing rads first, chemo second.   So, I'm having the rads and the oncotype, I will also have my genetic markers done, but they will have to show me some definite reason to go for chemo after all that. I don't want to do it as a 'just in case'. I will listen carefully, and I have a couple months to do more research before I have to give an answer. I may change my mind after that, but right now, given all of the above, I am thinking no.  It is not the right decision for everyone and I have several factors in my favor for this decision that don't apply to you because of your ages and dx.  Hey June - I peed bright blue for two days and they say the blue dye in my boob will last for 10 months. So I'm calling her Smurfette now. How long till the Appt when you may get the drains out? Jodi, what a rough two days that must have been! I am so glad they found none in the bone. That's super. You kick that cancer's butt girl! Pipers' right, you have a great attitude! Pipers, why is it all taking so long for you? You had to wait for biopsy and now a month for the op? What's up with that?

It seems to me that back on page 2 or something I said that I was seriously considering saying no to chemo and got questioned on why I would do that. Now I see I am not the only one proceeding with caution. June - you are skipping chemo too and Pipers is not even having the surgery yet. Jodi, your bc is a special case because they have to move fast in order to avoid complications, but it is nice to see that I am not alone in questioning the docs about chemo and rads. Regarding the alternative docs, nature docs etc, just so you know that I do not disapprove of alternative meds, I need to tell you a small story. My work will pay for any course we want to take, provided we pass it, if not, we pay. So I signed up for an Environmental Citizen course and a Gardening course. 2 weeks in, it was obvious that I could not handle the workload, so I made a deal with my disabled daughter. If you take the gardening course for me, I will buy you a laptop. Failing the course would cost me $380 plus a ton of embarrassment, the laptop would cost $449. To me it was a good deal. I aced Environmental while my DD did the same with Gardening. Then she went on to take a diploma course in herbology and then one in Reiki and another in Reiki and several in medicinal crystals. Bottom line is, even though I say seek both sides of any medical alternative, I never am without my selenite heart, my citrine and my hematite. When I had my op I was holding my selenite heart as I was wheeled in and I panicked, I can't put it on a shelf, it will be left behind, then my wonderful nurse taped it to my ankle under my sock. I don't think I am terribly superstitious, yet my DD has been encouraging me to always have my 'healing' crystals with me, and they do seem to make me feel better. So yes, I am a total fraud about alternative therapies. It just took me a little time to remember that I too am doing something the major medical community would pooh pooh. Love you all of you. ",

I am in the middle of menopause tho, so I am only going to be on it for 2 1/2 or 3 years, then they are moving me over to an AI. They figure I'll be completely done menopause by then. I know a lady who was on Tami for 20+ years. She was monitored and it was working for her, so they never did move her over to an AI. She's fine and in her late 70's now. Pipers, hi there girl.

I didn't have the energy to retype it, so I just went to bed. Are your dental issues all fixed up now? I'm just staying away from nuts in general, but I seem to have developed a craving for gummy bears. Just a few each day and I'm quite satisfied. I have always tried to listen to my body - in reality this is the first time it has failed me. Not saying nothing ever goes wrong, I've had my share of oopsies, but never something that I couldn't control. So I'm eating toward no recurrences or new tumors. Trying to be healthy, listening to what my body says I need. If I find I am eating bananas a lot, I need more potassium, more meat, protein, etc. Beer - must need more B12. lol Hugs'n'kisses to all of you.",

Treat accordingly. Best thing I did was not put any creams on until I was 2/3's done. Then I used only Rx base. It is the base for all medical prescriptions. 2 times a day, right after my bath that was saturated by Epsom salts. Read the instructions and follow them cuz I'll bet you had no idea you were supposed to use 2 cups per bath.  My breast after 3 days post rads is visually turning breast coloured again. Not burnt like earlier. I'm a redhead so I'm used to sunburns, but at first I didn't equate rads to sunburns. Please do. Hugs Jodi.

I think you are very good for me as you always make me think and question things. Now I know what GABA is - the reviews were super. I might look into that one because I've been in the basement again lately and would like to crawl up those stairs into the light. About the cancer prone personality, I've been reading alot about how being positive and proactive actually keeps people from getting cancer while people who are depressed and reactive are more prone to it.

How long will you be on vacation? I hope you have a great time with your family. 60+ hours a week is way to many girl!

I too have suffered from depression and I looked into those remedies you suggested. They look really interesting. I have been massaging my breast with dandelion oil for the fibroids and find it is returning to a normal feel. It is also supposed to reduce tumours although I don't have a lot of proof on that. I should look into it more. I am basically doing it because my DD (the nurse/herbalist/reiki/crystal healer) insisted that it was good for me. I am doing better now - better living through pharmaceuticals unfortunately. I just couldn't stand always feeling so very low - spent about 2 months in the basement of my mind. Finally crawled out - a little worse for wear, but better. One year - holy cow. Congrats to us all! Hugs'n'kisses, Deb ",

I'm not happy, I am not sad, I am not even scared. I have not cried, I have not ranted and raved. I don't feel mad at the world. I am kind of resigned. In my head I have already heard the dx and know it isn't good. So... From this state of numbness I have still achieved something that I truly appreciate. My hubby has been having chest pains and numbness in his arm and lips. But refused to see a doctor about it.  So. I asked him if he would rather we not go to the appt tomorrow. If he thought maybe it would be better not to know for sure. Just live our lives until they're done. I'm 56 so I've done a fair bit of living. Maybe we should just coast... He truly did consider it. Then he emphatically denied it would be a good idea. Long story short, he is calling the doctor on Tuesday for an appt. Thank you thank you thank you. In the meantime I realize this is my brain's way of coping. But it kind of hurts inside to have no feelings about this. I am scared of when the flood of emotion that I fully expect will occur. Will I be at work? In my car? At dinner with my kids? If I had a wish t would be in the middle of the night, in my bed, with my hubby to hold me. Ok just reread this - boy am I depressing.

In her opinion the important part is to identify what triggered you to make you start again. Stress? A party with other smoking people? Building a fence? (that was my most recent trigger - everyone smoked, it was hot, we stopped for frequent breaks and everyone lit up - eventually so did I) She also said 24 hours is a successful quit.

Can I add your name to her list? In the mean time I will add your whole family to my prayers. Juneping I think depression is a natural reaction to what each of us is going thru. And there are no degrees of depression that is acceptable either. Each of us is an individual and there are absolutely no way to predict how we will react. If you feel bad, treat yourself well. Eat your favourite comfort food. Have a glass of wine or a beer if you like, take a bubble bath with smelly candles. Whatever works!  piper, any news on the insurance / idiot doctor front? I hope things are going well. I go in 36 hrs from now. I've got good support and a bunch of fools who think they know what is good for me. Lol Sorry if I missed someone. Love to you all.

She decided to move after dad's death 2 years ago, sold her house, arranged to move into a retirement community, then broke her back 5 weeks before moving day. 4 weeks in hospital. I ended up doing all her packing and moving, in the evenings after work after I had visited her in the hospital for an hour (hospital is an hour away too). Then the challenge of getting her settled in. It's better now, but was very difficult at the time.  You worked with Pink's manager. I'm now star struck. You're a celebrity. Wow!! Lol. By association. No really, that is so cool. She was fabulous! I'm sure every tear was well warranted. Probably would have cried even without all that's going on. She was that good.  Please keep popping in.

However, my family find the fact that I now have a blue nipple to be hilarious. We're calling her Smurfette! Boy do I get the whole work thing too, I'm really busy at work trying to show my worth, yet things aren't getting done as fast as they used to. I've made a couple of errors that my boss is being really good about. I had to bring work home this weekend, just to catch up. My mind wanders off, or I can't find something I know I had just 5 minutes ago. It sucks. I don't want them to lose faith in me, so... Anyway, yesterday was cold and snowy, while today is cold and sunny. So the weather is marginally better at least. lol Jodi, you said you'd be leaning on us a lot this week, yet, not one post. What's up with you girl? You okay? What did they say on Wednesday? I hope your good - my prayers are with you. Hey Pipers, how's it going. You had your bone scan and CT this week - Wednesday? Like Jodi? Any results yet? I truly am thankful I have my mom still. I can't visit right now, but we call each other every day. Next Sunday, all the kids, grandkids, my DH and myself will be heading to the golf course to meet my mom for our annual Christmas brunch. It's a nice tradition, reasonable in price (about $10/person) and we get the room to ourselves (I book early) so the kids can run around a bit if they want and the adults talk about all kinds of stuff. Anyway, better get my butt off the chair and get some work done. Hugs'n'kisses to all. Oh, hi Ariom. Talk to you all this weekend I hope.",

And it didn't hurt a bit. My nurse navigator recommended Emla cream. You have to ask for it over the counter. It's a topical anesthetic. I'm really scared of needles and the thought of one in my nipple (eww) while awake was really scary for me. So it has 2 applications in the box and each covers about 2\"x2 1/2\". I put one on the nipple (for the radioactive stuff needle) and one where I figured the would put the wire and it really helped. The dye itself when in when I was under.  I was guessing your age from your avatar in which you look like you're in your thirties. You hide your age well lady!!! Would never have guessed 50 anything.  I'm glad you're so happy with your team, and like you said, if the extended time give your meds time to kick in, all the better. You have a great outlook on it. Well, off to bed for me. Have a nice night.",

Flax is er+ and will bond but the benefits are very good and worth the risk. The recommendation is no more than 2 tblsps daily of crushed flax. The reason for crushed is that flax seeds are pretty much like corn. They exit the body pretty much whole and do not give you the benefit of the omega3 etc. Also on the subject of soy, another plant product that bonds. I am going to start eating soy. The rule is no more than 2 portions a day. Above that amount and the benefits don't outweigh the risks. I won't use that much but I think I'll try it a couple times a week, flax too. I'm just going to keep it minimal and hopefully look for other anti - oxidants and things high in omega 3. O and first rad went well. Other than the tingling, I didn't feel a thing. :-)  ",

Like the Chinese, who ate it from birth. However, she also said, if you haven't don't start now. Same with flax. I was actually pretty happy with that because it made sense to me. The Chinese study is quite biased because they have eaten these foods forever. Maybe we should start our babies on some of these foods - I don't know.  Some of the stuff she said became instant crap to me tho. 7 portions of veggies/fruit, 7 portions of cereal/bread, 3 portions of milk/cheese/yogurt and 2 portions of meat/peanuts/eggs. I'm not a huge eater, but I am 5'10\" and 170. I will no doubt eat 3-4 portions of veggies/fruit, 0-1 portions of cereal /bread, 5 portions of milk/cheese/yogurt and 4-5 portions of meat/peanuts/eggs per day. I honestly don't know how to switch this up. I believe in milk, yogurt and cheese. I do NOT believe in cereals and grains, although rice and occasionally pasta is okay. And I LOVE meat, eggs and nuts. So her diet is brutal.  Anybody got a better take on this? ",
