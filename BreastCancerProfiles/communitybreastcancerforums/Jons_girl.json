I might get stomped on here by some.....because I at this time in my life am not personally a proponent of taking any med treatment. That's just where I am now.Perhaps I am the only one in this forum that caught my cancer at 3-4 mm. My cancer was IDC stage 1A, grade 1 PR+ and ER+ HER2-. My grandmother was on Tamoxifen for years..... I didn't want to take it when I found out I had br cancer. When I searched on the net I couldn't find really any documentation on stage 1 tumors and the best treatment for tumors that are slow growing and low stage tumors. I had very low proliferation rates on my tumor. I asked my med onco doctor why would I need to do radiation? Why would I need to take tamoxifen? I was seeing studies but most if not all of them were stage 2 or higher. It seems that very little in the way of studies have been done on women like me, with small tumor and very low proliferation/growth rate. He agreed. He said well I am fine with that if you decide to do neither treatment. As long as you come back to see me often. So I am doing that. I am very good about getting repeated diagnostics. I plan to have a MRI in June (see my doc every 6 mo now). I have been having ultrasounds. But I think after reading stories here, that MRI is the best diagnostic, especially if the woman has dense breast tissue like I have. I found my tumor in May with surgery early July. All is clear, margins and 0/2 nodes. My onco surgeon also thinks I will probably be just fine. So it isn't just my med onco doctor agreeing with me. I am trying to exercise daily when I can. My diet is probably strange to mos (no meat, dairy and limit sugar). I don't know if that will help me in anyway stay cancer free. I had a nurse practioner tell me that a onco doc told her that exercising daily for 30 min is as good as taking Tamoxifen. I have no idea if that is really true but I have heard that from more than just the NP. Whether any of this dietstuff helps I do not know....but just passing on what I have been learning. Oh I forgot to add....I am a pre-menopausal 50 yr old. So I want to encourage your wife to just do what she thinks is best. If she did catch her tumor very very early that would be great! I wish you both the very best! Hope you both have a good evening.",

I did go to a breast center after finding my lump myself. The 3D mammo they did missed my small tumor completely. So if they missed my tumor the likelihood of them actually catching precancerous mass forming is probably not high. I had I believe the lead rad dr reading it too. So my trust in Mammos isn\u2019t high at all. I know mammo is the gold standard. Basically the go to for breast cancer detection. But it didn\u2019t work for me. My thought is that if my tumor was obviously seen on ultrasound then I would think any other tumors that have formed probably would be found that way as well. I felt my tumor. So ultimately I caught it first. I have a lead tech who does my ultrasounds. I have the same tech do the ultrasounds for continuity. I also go to a place that is a specialized center for diagnostics. Not just a hospital. The same radiologist can read them too. So more continuity. If I chose to do mammos each year and it caught Dcis I would not choose to have dcis cut out anyway. I\u2019d have it watched. My doc would be fine with that I\u2019m sure. My tumor also was very slow growing. Low prolif rate. My thought is mammos did nothing for me regarding catching anything early. So if it\u2019s only going to catch dcis....? I\u2019m not sold on mammos. My doc would order mammos yearly I\u2019m sure if I asked for that. But I won\u2019t go without ultrasound. That\u2019s what saw my tumor very very clearly!! Showed blood source and everything very obviously. Sorry....not trying to be a pain in the backside ðŸ˜Š. I\u2019m just not sold on mammos. Even if they can see calcifications.

I've seen that some docs out in the medical world are saying you don't necessarily need to treat dcis. Some do the wait and watch carefully route. My cancer I felt as a lump. Then went for manual exam then they placed stickers at the spot to mark two spots(the one I felt and another spot) neither of the spots showed anything on having a 3D diagnostic mammogram. One spot was benign. But the other spot was IDC. Stage 1,grade 1. Literally you can clearly see the sticker on the scan cd but the tumor is not there anywhere! Report states nothing found. Then they sent me for a ultrasound after the diagnostic 3D mammo (because tumor was felt). It showed veryclearly my tumor and even the blood source!! My question in my head has been if I had not felt my tumor, when would they have found it!? Sending me for mammos wasn't the right diagnostic for me. I have extremely dense breast tissue. I'm 51. They say your tissue is supposed to get less dense as you grow older. Mine hasn't. My mother at 72 still has dense tissue as does her sister in her 60s. So it frustrates me they send all women down the same road. Get a mammogram. That didn't wk for me. My question djmammo is regarding calcifications. That is basically dcis. Very early breast cancer. If a woman like myself has yearly whole breast ultrasound isn't that just as good? Eventually the calcifications are seen on ultrasound correct? Mine was seen at 4 mm! I don't really see the purpose of having mammograms anymore for my tissue type. My mo is fine with me having ultrasound every six months. I chose no meds no rad. Which he's fine with as long as I keep getting ultrasounds. Just curious why some of my breast docs are still pushing mammos on me when clearly it missed my tumor. It seems wrong for them to keep pushing me to have mammos. If it didn\u2019t catch my tumor how on earth will it catch anything else! Sorry for the book. I want to understand. ",

It appears throughout my young adult life and up til now I\u2019ve had varying degrees of density. It appears to be getting more dense not less as I am getting older. Do you know why that is? Any theories that doctors have stated about that? A nurse at a breast center told me yr breasts can have different density throughout the month.

If my cancer had been more aggressive, my decision probably would have been different. When you talk about genetics connections to cancer, that's a big curiosity for me. My maternal grandmother had br cancer twice. Died of it. (2nd time she had been cancer free and begged her gyn to give her hormone pill ex so she could feel better after going off tamoxifen after 7 yrs. cancer came back and killed her) so I think the 2nd round of cancer was brought on by her taking those hormones again. My maternal aunt got br ca dx two wks or so prior to mine. My mother has had breast biopsies no cancer tho. (We have other extended family on maternal side with cancer in their past too). Idid the gene testing. I was negative which was great! But then my surgeon said well that means if you do have a genetic connection to breast cancer it's a gene we just don't know about yet. Hummm I thought that wasn't really a comforting comment. Lol.",

He has been practicing for 30 yrs at least. Probably more. The recurrence rate without those things really didn't change a whole lot for me. So I chose to not do them. My onco' request/requirement was that I go see him often. So I'm seeing him every 6 mo. And we are doing diagnostics every 6 mo. And I'm ok with that. Just thought I'd share my experience.

I didn't read your entire post. But I had a tumor that was 3-4 mm caught it miraculously because I don't do self exams (I do now tho!). Anyway, my tumor was stage 1A. Grade 1. My surgeon suggested I taketamoxifen for 5 yrs. I said no I didn't want to take it. Was told to wait til after surgery and we'd talk about it again. After surgery when margins were clear and nodes negative I told her I didn't want to take it. My med oncologist I also told I wasn't finding any studies really that were done with women like myself....small tumor...low proliferation rate and node and margins clear. I agree with what you say above. The studies don't show a huge recurrence rate if you don't take the med. it was very low. I told him....why would I do radiation or take tamoxifen? I chose not to do radiation or tamoxifen. I thought if it were to come back I'd want options other than a mastectomy. After talking to him he said that he understood what I was saying. And if I didn't choose to do either option he'd support me in that decision. As long as I go back to see him regularly. I told him I would. I'm seeing him every 6 mo right now. And planning to have ultrasounds every six months. MRI maybe yearly. Just as precaution. The key if it comes back is to catch it early in my mind. My surgeon was ok with my decision as well. I am trying to exercise daily as well. I was told 30 min a day of exercise was as good as taking tamoxifen. I don't know if that's true but a medical professional told me that. I eat a plant based diet. Not sure if that will help me but that's what I do Both my onco med dr and surgeon believe all is going to be fine. Very low chance it will return.",

I have what they classify as level 4 or D (new density classification would be level D old classification was level 4) which is classified as 'extremely dense breast tissue'. I got a copy of the CD with the images and I couldnt believe how dense my tissue is/was! White everywhere! I can't remember if it was gigibee or swimjames that said you had dense tissue and your cancer was seen on mammo. What level of breast density do you have? I am curious about that. It is interesting to me because I have recently been hearing about women who's cancer was seen on mammo and have dense breast tissue...but had been told previously that if your breasts are dense (40% of women have dense tissue) your cancer can't be seen on a mammo. Yesterday someone pointed out to me that that isn't true. She said her cancer had calcifications. So I wonder if that is what they see on the mammo is the calcifications? and all other types can't be seen? I am learning more about dense tissue. Don't claim to be a expert for sure on any of that. Cancer info is changing so much it seems. My onco surgeon told me they are learning more stuff all the time, some they don't know yet, and some they are finding is stuff they had wrong. That is so reassuring. lol. gigibee I think we just have to be very very proactive and push for other diagnostics when we feel they are being to laid back about rechecking. I have my 1 yr recheck in June and I am strongly considering having a MRI. I have seen stories on this website where womens cancer wasn't caught on mammo or ultrasound! That is a little scary to me. But I know not all of us have the same experiences so I try to look at it from that point of view. My experience is still pretty fresh in my mind, maybe someday I will be more relaxed about my rechecks. But right now I push for what I think I need. My onco docs think I will be fine. But because I chose to not have radiation or any med therapy I am very much wanting to keep a close eye on it. I caught mine very very early....and it was low prolif rate. My cancer was caught very obviously on ultrasound.....mammo saw nothing at all. So the question I have in my head is....is ultrasound good enough for the rest of my life or do I need to also be doing mri each year? I too have the same frustrations you both mentioned....not sure the answers but just to stand up for yourself. That is one thing we can do.",

I remember walking in the race for the cure after my gma died in 99' thinking at the time wow there are so many people affected by this disease, why haven't they found a cure? And I am still wondering that about 19 years later! I know they have made strides in the right direction....but I just wonder sometimes about all that. Moth: Thank you for your post about the CYP2D6 gene. That got me to thinking and I went and pulled out some testing I had done a few years ago. I am not sure if they tested me at the time for the CYP2D6 gene. But I WAS tested for the CYP2C19 gene...which I was considered heterozygeously positive for. I don't really understand all the studies on this gene and tamoxifen. I did a search for info on whether it might also have some connection to breast cancer or it's recurrence. I am not finding anything that is conclusive yet. It appears they are researching that though. So I wonder if that is one connection my family may have to breast cancer. Gene testing and connections to cancer is very interesting to me. I am sure there are quite a few other genes they haven't found conclusively yet are connected to breast cancer but maybe in the future they will have that evidence?? Anyway, thank you for bringing up the CYP2D6 gene....it got me to pull out my test results! What is interesting too I looked to see which genes they test you for when they tested me for cancer gene testing and I didn't see those genes on the testing. It was on another test I had done that that CYP2C19 test results had been given. I wonder when they will add these type of genes to breast cancer genetic testing in the future? Swimjames: I have another question I probably should know this but thought you'd probably know. When does a patient's breast cancer become grade 2? Like what percentage of proliferation is it graded as grade 2? Is grade 1 up to like 10%? And then grade to would go from 11-%? Curious about that.",

(3-4 mm) but because of my tissue I'm thinking might be good for a yearly MRI. Not sure if I'm being a little paranoid or what. I'm very small breasted. Size A. So maybe MRI isn't needed.",

Wow!!! Stories like yours are the reason I'm wondering if having a MRI might be a good idea. So glad they were able to take your tumor out! Georgia: I posted on another post about my treatment choice. And why I chose no radiation or tamoxifen. So hopefully you can find my answer by searching on my other post so I don't have to explain here as wellðŸ˜ŠPlease respect my decision tho k? I did a lot of research and talking with my MO to come to my decision Oceanbum: yes your story is amazing!! I've heard a bit of your story on one of the threads I started. You are one of the reasons I think I am asking about whether I should have a MRI. I'm thinking it might be a good idea since I've not had one. I'm being diligent in making sure I have diagnostics. ðŸŒº Here is my story I posted on another link (see below) ðŸŒ¸For those of you who suggested a 3D mammo.....it's a lie they tell us that 3D mammos see dense breast tissue. Not true. I have BIRAD 4 level density. Extremely dense tissue. I even asked for a copy of the DVD film to see my tissue for myself. You cannot at all see my tumor! Please don't let radiologists or gyn's tell you they can see dense tissue in 3D mammos. scattered density BIRAD 2 is possible to see tumors yes. But BIRAD 3&4 (heterogeneously dense and extremely dense)in most states are required by law now to notify women if they have these two BIRAD classes and suggest more diagnostics such as ultrasound or MRI Here is my story: Hi, I'm new here. Last May I found a lump by chance and went to have a manual exam at a local breast center. The nurse pract did a very thorough exam. She thought it was a cyst. She sent me for a diagnostic 3D mammo and Ultrasound back to back. Long story. But the 3D mammo saw NOTHING! I wish you could read my report! No abnormalities found!! If I had relied on the 3D mammo report and had no other diagnostics my tumor would NEVER had been caught so early!! Right after I had the 3D mammo I had a ultrasound. And it was SO obvious that it was cancer. They wanted me to go have a biopsy right away. Long story. But my tumor was caught at 3-4mm! Ultrasound is a excellent way to catch breast cancer very early!! I have what they term as \"extremely dense breast tissue\". BIRAD 4. Dense tissue shows up white on a mammogram. Cancer ALSO shows up white. That is why the denser your tissue is, the more difficult it is to see cancer on a mammogram, any mammogram 3D or not! I'm so thankful I had a ultrasound!! They do not cost a lot either! So I would highly suggest if you know you have dense breast tissue(it says on yr mammogram report what you have) tell your health professional you are demanding to have a bilateral breast ultrasound! It may save yr life! This website: (won't let me post the link). (Look up areyoudense dot org )will show you a map of where they have breast density reporting laws. Most states have laws now where if you have dense breast tissue legally you have a right to a ultrasound. I hope my experience helps someone. My maternal gma died of bc. My maternal aunt had lobular cancer diagnosis two wks prior to my diagnosis. Now I'm having ultrasounds every 6 mo. Advocate for yourself. So important!",

If this doctor isn't really concerned and telling you you could wait 6 mo then there must not be much to be worried about. They pretty much wanted me to have biopsy right away. So with how you are describing what the doctor said, I would lean on the not too worried side. Keep us posted! Hugs! It isn't fun waiting for results at all! Totally understand!",

Also you can ask for a copy of the report and they will even send a copy (mine does if I request it) of the images on cd disk. They should do that for free. I'm trying to keep copies of my records. Isn't very a bad idea. Then you can follow what they say from one report to the next report. Sometimes it's helpful to have your own report. Keep us posted! Hugs. Hope all is well!",
