Then you might feel some pressure and the machine will make a slight whooshing sound as the dr takes the samples. I told the Radiologist if he ever had another woman as scared as I was, he could give them my name and I would talk to them, or come be with them. I wish I was close enough to do that for you. Prayers for negative results, but you have found a good group of women if you have to come back for more support.",

The radiation for me wasn't too bad.  I admire everyone who has done Chemo.  This is a supportive place, and you need to explore the various topics and post so that you get acquainted.  Honestly, this website kept me sane for the duration.  Everyone here gets it--your friends who have not had cancer, just won't---they want to help you but, they just don't get it.....They love you---but the people here have walked in your shoes, know the tricks to get you over the hurdles, etc.  We are all here to help one another.",

I am sending you my guardian angel to keep yours company tomorrow.  Sometimes, she gives you a warm tingle when she arrives and leaves.  She'll stay until she's no longer needed, and she can find her way home to me just fine.  On one of the other threads I follow, everyone says they will be in your pockets, having a party----I'm a little to clausterphobic to be there.  LOL.",

I don't think you can predict what happens w/o.  I asked that question when he wrote my first script, and he said nobody knows, but that they had done a significant survey of women who chose not to do hormone therapy, that later had a re-occurrence and they asked them, what percentage reduction would have made the pill worthwhile, and the response was predominately, ANY reduction, however small........  Also Bosum, I didn't do chemo and my memory is completely fried.  I am barely 57 and I can't remember anything anymore.....Like whether I ate lunch, or what I had to eat, or how to do an exercise from one day to the next.......so not sure if it is all the chemo brain or the stress of the cancer DX.

      "Content": "Jun 6, 2014 05:57PM Redheaded1 wrote: MIMI- my experience with radiation was mostly positive. I met with the RO for about 1.5 hours prior to my surgery. She did a very thorough history and I mentioned to her that while I didn't have connective tissue disease, I did have an elevated ANA TITER test every time it had been done.  She decided then that I would not receive \"boosts\".  Boosts are treatments that specifically target the tumor bed and usually come at the end of treatment.  I then waited until my surgeon said I was ok (3-6 weeks from surgery depending on healing) and I went for my simulation.  HInt- if your surgeon gives you exercises post surgery do them, because you have to hold your arm up and back for simulation and for each rads treatment.  At the simulation, they work on getting you positioned just right, take non-contrast CT scans, etc. nothing invasive, but your arm is kept in an somewhat uncomfortable position for anywhere from 45 minutes to I'd guess about an hour.  You have to lay still while all this takes place and not move your arm.  My surgeon didn't give me any exercises and my arm and hand went numb.  The RO gave me some to go home and start doing.  Then, they develop a plan on how point the radiation at your breast, build you a little \"mold\" to put your arm into each time you go, and if they are going to tattoo you (it does NOT hurt) they do that--otherwise you get stickers that you have to not let come off and black markers.  Some get a combination of tattoos and stickers.  I was told to not face the shower and if they came off, to come right to the clinic to get them reattached, not to put them back on  (they are key to your treatment being lined up properly).  Nurse went over the lotions and potions you can use and not use,when you can se them, soap, deodorant, etc. About 10days later, I was called to come in for my \"verification\" and first treatment. It actually takes longer to undress and get positioned than it did for treatment to be delivered. I went for 28 treatments. M-F.at 1pm  Each week they will take x-rays to verify that they are hitting where they need to be. That takes a little longer on the table.  In my case, each day I would be red and warm when I left, but by morning, it was gone. I am busty, and the area under my breast burned and became irritated by 3rd week. It is very important that this area be kept dry when you go for your treatment.  I think, in hindsight that my lotion probably ran down and collected there, and I was damp when I got zapped.  (This is why they will tell you not to apply your crème within 4 hours of treatment time. )  On my third from the last treatment I got very red and stayed red.  I am still itchy (last treatment May 20) but I am just a little pink now. Important thing is to ALWAYS ask any question or concern.  You shouldn't be worrying or wondering about anything.  The nurses are all helpful and caring and you will most likely see your RO once a week for skin checks.  If you don't like a cream they suggest, tell them, or if you itch or burn, tell them. I found it much easier than I imagined.  I did learn from women on this site to get some cotton wife beater mens t-shirts at Target and wear them Underneath a cotton sports bra one to two sizes bigger than usual.  I am still in my T-shirts---they are so comfortable.   I made the mistake of going to an expensive bra shop and getting fitted for a cotton bra---clearly, they knew nothing about radiation treatments.  If I shrink down to that size, again, it will be nice, but if not OUCH!  (your breasts can swell during treatment-hence the bigger size bra-also you don't want anything tight underneath your breasts, cause that area is tender)  I used a prescription crème called X-Clair most of the time, but also used Calendula crème from the Natural Foods store and Aquaphor and Cetaphil at the end and post rads.  I used 99% pure aloe vera gel when I felt hot and I used Benedry and Hyrdocortisone crème for itching---All approved in advance by the RO. Disclaimer: Everything above is based on my personal experience, everyone is different and may have very different experiences than mine.  I am just happy to share what I have experienced so others might benefit in some way.   I don't want the self-appointed cyber-police to come calling",

Sparkle- I know it is days later, but what lab did your Oncotype DX test?  Mine was done by Genomic Labs in CA.  My score was 8, with a 6% reoccurrence with drug therapy.  I couldn't read the second page it was so tiny, but my MO said if I had a score below 10, I was ok to skip chemo  I can't remember if it was 10 or 18 at which chemo was considered.  I am sure at 18 he would have said I needed it. and maybe we were going to debate it if it was between 10-18.    I think all his remarks were tempered by the pathology report from my surgery as well.  I had a small tumor, stage 1, grade 1.   I am so blessed to have this man as my doctor. ",

I doubt your breast will shrink any.  I am still a D.... They may not cover making you bigger, But, most insurance will cover what HAS to be done.

I have a sulfa allergy, so silverene is out. 1Moe--were you having a stabbing pain in your breast? or a burning from the radiation?  They ask me each week if I have had pain, and I haven't really except an occasional twinge.  I won't mince words here, if you are big breasted  ( I am) and on your feet all day, and trying to wear a cotton sports bra, that is probably it.  the girls need support and these cotton things don't work.  I have done this with some success in the first 3 weeks.  I wear a mans cotton u neck sleevelss t-shirt first, and then put a more supportive bra--in the loosest setting you can for the band over the top.  BUT NO UNDERWIRES.  My doc was absolutely adamant that I not wear an UNDERWIRE .

      "Content": "Jun 3, 2014 02:03PM - edited Jun 3, 2014 02:06PM by Redheaded1 Mimi--sorry you have to go thru this.  Everything I am about to say to you is based on my experience-everyone is not the same.  I had a mammogram that showed a mass less than a cm. The ultrasound confirmed it, and the cone biopsy showed it was malignant.  I met with a surgeon, a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist prior to my surgery. All of them confirmed that from their reviews, I was a strong candidate for lumpectomy.  I had lumpectomy with a sentinel node biopsy .  the biopsy confirmed that there was no cancer in the lymph glands and I was Stage 1, grade 1, with ERpositive, PR posive and HER negative.  The Medical onc ordered an OncotypeDX test on the tumor tissue.  Its usually done on small tumors.  Ask to see if they will order this for you.  My score came back as 8, which was low enough I could skip chemo--which I very gratefully did.  I did radiation, which I completed on the 20th of May, and now will be beginning a pill (Arimidex) for the next 5-10 years. The only question I had for my MO when he was done explaining everything to me (about 1.5-2 hours later was----If I keep my breast will I ever stop thinking I have cancer?  He said it takes at least a year for women to push it back in their minds and believe they are a survivor.  I remember well how I did the same thing you are doing, first thought in the a.m., last thought at night, even had nightmares about it.   I still struggle with it. almost every day  but I am only 5 months into the year he said it would take..  That being said, I don't think I would have had any regrets had I taken the breast off. I have seen some of the pics the ladies here have posted after reconstruction, and I am amazed, absolutely amazed at their results. But I don't think that having a flat chest again would be that bad either--I am decidedly single, alone, and satisfied with my life that way.  I understand most others might have very different feelings about this.  My cancer center gave me a book titled BREAST CANCER TREATMENT HANDBOOK by Judy C. Kneece, RN, OCN.  In the back of the book are tear-out pages with questions to ask of each of your specialists.  Mine pretty much covered them all with their \"orientation\" consultation. She also wrote one for your Support Partner in Breast cancer. There are excellent resources here on this website, in addition to the discussion boards. I made myself a pink ring binder (God Ihate that color) with all my stuff divided by doctor type, treatment type, etc. based on the recommendations here on this website.  It saved me to have everything organized where I could go back and find/re-read test results, etc.  You will find a very caring bunch of women here who are eager to help you succeed in your fight against this disease.  Just remember, you are in charge, you make the final decisions, etc.   Good Luck, Godspeed, and don't be a stranger.  ",
