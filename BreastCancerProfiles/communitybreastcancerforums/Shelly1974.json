I had mastectomy for ALH on January 27, 2015 with tissue expanders. Everything went well and no drains anymore. Last Thursday went for first expansion (and last) and now wait till surgery for final implants on May. My question and concern is how softer will be the final implants comparing to TE? I'm very skinny and no fat can be donated from anywhere. Will the final implants be hard as the TE? It's feels like constantly muscle spasm. Hard and unmovable. Anyone that had the final exchange can tell from her experience? Thanks! You all are the best. Log in to post a reply",

Doctor recommends excision surgery on those three ares and tamoxifen for five years. Just from the idea that not only my breast will have holes and scars in three places, I will need to live with anxiety and checkup every 6 months not to mention horrible side effects for tamoxifen. Doctor thinks double mastectomy is too radical. I am just so confused. Why is it radical if I have ALH in three areas? Did any of you was in that situation? Please help. I am 40.

Reading all medical literature and posts of how woman been thru multiple biopsies and screening. I think the best option to be to remove and live without the fear. 1. I have ALH in both breasts. 2. Relatively young so more years to go with it. Please feel free to comment. It is a great support in the whole process. Shelly",

      "Content": "Shelly1974 wrote: I have bilateral ALH and no family history, 40 Yo, went to see two doctors and both recommended excision surgery and tamoxifen. When I ask about the relative risk, all of them seem to think the risk is around 20%. Reading the literature I see that there is a big difference in relative risk when ALH is diagnosed in young woman and post-menopausal woman There are three studies cited in the attached link and all show increased risk for younger woman http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa044383#t=articleTop 1.  First  study calculated twice the risk observed among women younger  55 years of older woman (6.99 and 3.37, respectively). 2.  The Breast Cancer Detection and Demonstration Project showed that the risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women with atypia was elevated by a factor of 12.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 68.0), as compared with 3.3 among postmenopausal women with Atypia (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 10.0) 3.  The Nurses Health Study showed an increased risk of breast cancer among premenopausal women with Atypia (9.6 times ). If the normal risk is around 5% we are looking at 35% to 60% risk of breast cancer So why doctors ignore that and refuse to go on Prophylactic Mastectomy? No one was able to give me reasonable explanation. What am I missing? I CANT do Tamoxifen and asking for quality of life with no 6 months tests and biopsies. Why doctors ignore the statistics ?     Log in to post a reply",
