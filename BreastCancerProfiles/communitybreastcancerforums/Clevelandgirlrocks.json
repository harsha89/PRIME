    "Content": "Clevelandgirlrocks wrote: I was recently diagnosed with IDC and am undergoing my first chemo treatment (Perjeta, herceptin, texotere and carboplatin) as I type. Second treatment is scheduled for Aug 5 - the day we planned to take the family on vacation to New England (12 hour by car, 90 minutes by plane). Realize we may need to postpone a day or two. Does anyone have any advice about travel? We'll be staying in a private home which should make things easier. But thoughts on flying vs driving? Carrying injections on a plane? Any advice would be helpful!! Thanks!! Log in to post a reply",
