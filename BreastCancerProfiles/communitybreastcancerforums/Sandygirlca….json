Mammomel, thank your for replying.  Funny thing is - I have told no one.  Except my husband.  Not chatting with the ladies or girlies makes the unknown also hard.... but I didnt want anyone to know and talk about it to me all the same.  Strange isnt it?  But your reply meant someone else out there has been through it.  How long did it take to get your results?  Was yours also calcifications?  Glad to hear you are doing well,  Congrats on your doses now being on the light side of chemo - You must have gone through a great deal of worry these past 10 months.   Thanks for the prayers - I too when lying awake tonight, will pray for your continued recovery as well.  Have a great night.",
