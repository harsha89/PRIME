My tumor was less than .5 centimeter but the sentinel node biopsy showed micrometases in 3 or 4 nodes removed. I'm going through chemo now --- not a picnic but not all that bad either. Best wishes to you; mine was Grade 3 also. The chemo nurses where I go said that even if chemo wasn't recommended they would want it anyway because it's too risky if there's even a question not to do it. That may be going a little far but I'd rather be safe than sorry. Hope all goes well and I'm glad you have a surgeon that you trust -- all the best to you and take care.",
