My oncologist has presented me with two treatment options: AC-T, dose-dense 8 infusions over the course of 16 weeks vs. TC, 4 infusions every 3 weeks over the course of 12 weeks. After factoring age, grade, stage.... etc ect.... there is just a 1.4% difference between the two treatments. I need to decide whether that small added risk is worth the additional side-effects and weeks of chemo. I am leaning strongly toward TC x 4. Thoughts?   (also... hope its ok, but I've posted this question elsewhere too... but since many of you here have already, and are currently experiencing the AC- T treatment... I thought you could give me some first-hand feedback) Thank you ~ and wishing you wellness while we look forward to summer - to when this is behind us!!! ",

It was explained to me -- directly from the breast cancer coordinator of Robert Packer Hospital in PA -- that the test reveals how well cancer with respond to chemo and I need chemo no matter what the score is. This is why I didn't have one ordered for me. This really pisses me off to find out she gave me inaccurate information. Nothing was explained to me about learning about the % for recurrence.  I've since switched doctors to one in upstate NY, and did talk about it with my current oncologist prior to switching my treatment around -- it still wasn't presented to me as protocol -- its still something I have to ask for apparently. I have good insurance. I don't understand why this hasn't factored into my treatment. Well I will call my oncologist tomorrow and find out what he wants to do about it.  At this point, I hate to wait for results before doing anything. Seriously need to think about this one. Thank you for sharing your experience. Your original diagnosis is very similar to mine, only better/earlier detected than mine.  I've been told I'm 'very' er+/pr+, there were numerical scores on my pathology -- so I'm inclined to think mine wouldn't change markers. But who the hell knows now! Since you're 'almost TN'.. are you going to bother with Tamoxofen and all its side-effects?   ",

I knew something wasn't quite right. I spent last winter doing inner cleanses and minor detoxing. This year I starting taking vitamin D -- attributing my lack of energy to possibly seasonal affected depression. I couldn't accept \"age\" as the reason because there are many energetic 40 year olds.  Well this thread might be a small ray of light. If, after chemo, I'm not only staying alive longer... but get my energy back... that is something I will think about and look forward to - during the next many challenging months!",

That does sound better.  I'm 45 -- too old for this hairstyle but I kinda like it. Good to know that it will eventually grow out and look \"normal\" though.

The hair is doing its own thing.    Jpmomof3 and Kelloggs -- You both have the faux hawks too... we should start a punk band!     JoanQuilts -- It seems like hair might grow in a little faster after less chemo. I had TCx4. Looks like you had more.... but that being said -- there was a big difference in just the past 2 weeks.    Eileenohio -- It sounds like herceptin is slowing things down for you (?) but I do think exposure to the sun helps hair grow.      Well... tomorrow is my 6 month follow-up with the Breast Specialist who did my mastectomy.

I'm afraid if I do that... it'll be too depressing!    KCB... how true! When I see pictures of me with the long hair I realize it didn't always look that great. Was kind of a big shaggy mess. Of course then I see the \"good hair\" days... and miss it.    Rockym  --- YES to your inquiry.  It has grown back in STRAIGHT and darker down there.   Why darker down there and lighter (more gray) on top...? I don't know.    I'm just glad it isn't straight on my head... since it was never straight before. I think most of us want our old hair back. I don't know what \"chemo curls\" look like... or why so many hate them.... but my hair is coming back with curls that look like the type I had before. Kind of a wavy curl.  Maybe that will change as it grows out...  I'm 16+ weeks PFC.    WaveWhisper --   I'm mostly enjoying my faux hawk... even at age 45. I bought some Got2Be Glued hair gel to help control it a little. I think when the sides get long enough... the hair will hang better. Gravity will be on our side... at least when it comes to unruly hair. Have to get through the short stages first I guess.    JoJo -- My hair fell out around 2 weeks after 1st infusion. I buzzed it off close to head... but did not \"shave\" it off to the skin because my onc warned me against it  (said a cut could turn into infection while immunity down).  Not sure if this is why -- but I had the most sore uncomfortable time. I had a bazillion hats given to me (just like the rest of you I'm sure) but could only stand wearing  1 soft fleece hat. It was an unfortunate color -- HOT pink -- and an unfortunate shape -- looked like a condom-head. But I was oh so grateful to the friend that gave it to me... since it was the only way I could lie down and sleep for a few weeks. The back of my skull eventually broke out and I couldn't even lie down without pain at one point. They put me on antibiotics which helped. Anyway.... I think it wouldve been better to ignore my onc and just shave it down to the skin. Maybe others disagree... maybe my skull was extra sensitive. IN any case... hopefully you won't experience this!   Denise -- yes.. I experienced scalp tenderness when the hair started growing back. It didn't last long and wasn't too bad.    I guess I have a sensitive scalp! Tell you what -- hair is so much more comfortable than bald.    Its late (took over an hour to read all posts and try and catch up!) Goodnight all. ",
