I'm hoping for the best (like us all), so I am staying positive. Waiting stinks, but I should have something scheduled for next week. thank you again!!!  ",

I have posted in another forum that didn't get too many results and this is more active so I'm hoping I can be helped. I had a lumpectomy and radiation about 9 years ago, and the rib right under the infected breast has had pain every so often through the years (usually around my period). never felt a lump and I have had it checked out with mamos/sonos and nothing has ever come up. The last 4 weeks I have experienced the same pain, but its just not going away. Sometimes it feels also that i have to breath harder. Additionally feeling around the bottom of my breast, close to the rib I have little lumps, one inparticular seems to hurt when I press it. the right breast also has little lumps and reading up on this I saw that ropey lumps are normal. I do have an appointment with my surgeon next week but I did want to be a bit proactive and costochondritis came up. since there is a diagnosis of it, does this sound normal? I know lumps arent good, and a reoccurance, and radiation induced cancer is always possible, but I am really interested in knowing what others have felt and the symptoms they have experienced..",
