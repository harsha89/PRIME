And O2behealthy (and that you are)!!! My day is just made with your news right now. Your strength is wonderful!  Hi Catbill, I hope you are doing good today. I feel I can relate to a lot of what you are going through lately re the TEs. I had a BMX w/TE on 10/18 and have had 3 expansions thus far. The last two were filled with less and it felt a lot better. The first expansion felt so uncomfortable that I thought something was wrong, but was assured that it was normal. Ugh! I did get great support and info on this subject from our sisters on these threads. You know who you are... happymom8285, 02bhealthy, don23 and so many more. :) Catbill, do you mind if I ask when your BMX was?  Lots of hugs to every sister today. ",

You are great and as always thanks for your words. Jo, You're so almost done! You hang in there. You are in a good place with only a couple more rads left. You can do it. I know you can. I can hear it in your posts that you write. Seyla, Thank you for all your support that is at the right time and from the heart. In answer to your question treatment is at a hospital.  Boatergirls and Oakley, I am thinking of you both and praying as you make the right decisions. I know you will do what is right for you. We have some similarities in type of cancer, but I am her2+ and I can say that I chose the treatment (chemo and herceptin) because of this. It is great that you do not have the her2+. As long as the onc agrees that you do not have to rush the treatment then take your time with this decision. The right thing to do will come as you talk to a couple opinions. raincity,Thank you for helping me the list of things to bring to treatment. I will do that. mimi, Sounds like you did well shopping on Black Friday. I got a couple items, but I mostly shop that day for fun.  Catbill, Thanks for your additional recommendations for my list. ;) Meece, Thanks for your tips and item to add to the bag. Valjean-Start listening because I am going with your motto, \"I am woman, hear me roar.\"  Donna-You are inspirational in your posts. Congrats on completing your recon. Yeah! jp3-I am praying for you as you decide what is best for you. I have to tell you I had a reexcision and then a mx, but I did not know what to do. It takes a little time. One thing I remember thinking that someone told me to do was to think how great it is that it is not in the lymph nodes and that is great. Keep your mind open. You will get there and know the right choice.  I am falling asleep! Good night. :)",

It is funny, up until now I would never have known that those two feelings could be mixed. Not pain, just strange. Thank you for all the caring words. It does feel good to know you are all behind me, that is for sure. Seyla, the floor of the hospital seemed to be similar to your description with all that you would need and most importantly an amazing nurse that I told my husband is an angel on earth. I could not think of any other way to describe her. Anyways, it is one down and I can't thank all of you enough for walking with me through it.   I have so much to say, but do not want to forget anything so here goes. 3jaysmom-It would not be the same if you did not stay here.

Once again, it seems like one of those situations that you have to go with your gut and it will be the right decision either way. JMW, are you children little ones?",

I feel recovered from surgery (and am going step by step with the recon part). I have been talking to my onc re treatment recently. I am most likely going to begin treatment over the next week as I am Her2+. I am also ER+, thus need to look into ways to address that as well. I can completely understand when I read about how you do not want BC to define you. With that said, I am laughing because my first couple sentences I used to introduce myself to you are all about just that-the type of BC I have. Well, maybe I get a pass because this is a breast cancer discussion board. :) All kidding aside, I believe if you do not want something to define you, then it can not. It is going to be an interesting road and I am praying for peace, strength and goodness along each of our roads. Take care, jp3 and talk soon. Feel free to PM me if you want, especially as you are building up the number of times with your posts.  On another note, has anyone had a MUGA heart scan or test? I am having one before I start treatment and was concentrating so much on the treatment options that I did not ask what the details are procedure is for the MUGA. Can anyone shed any light on this? I know that I start by getting an IV with radioactive dye in it. I am not sure what is next. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.",

It feels as though it has been a whirlwind for the past couple months as you all know only to well. I have finished Taxol recently and am continuing with the Herceptin for the rest of the year. I am wondering if anyone has experienced or has info regarding menopause side effects happening and getting stronger (hot flashes constantly) after recently finishing Taxol? I thought that during the medication the body would be temporarily put into menopause, but now am thinking that it may have thrown my body into it for good. I am 40 now. I have not started Tamox yet. Can this happen?

Recovery is going well and the advice I was given from all of you was appreciated. One thing that stayed with me was to go in for surgery with a clear mind knowing the right decision had been made. That advice helped so much and made a big difference for me. Thank you. Michelle, I am praying for you.

I am recovering from surgery and actually need to call my onc tomorrow to decide what the next step is going to be. I relate to your perspective completely. I also have to echo Valjean when she says it is so great that you already feel a strong connection with your team.  Valjean, your quote is great.  I can't believe the posts since a day ago. All of them were so great to read. I am so secure with all of you, but I think I better also check out a reconstruction group every once in awhile b/c I am being thrown into it now and it is all so new. I don't want to get into recon talk to much as it is not the thread for it, but is there anyone in our group that had the TE recon that I might be able to PM if I had a couple questions? For the first couple months since being diagnosed I was on a mission and lately I have to admit I just can't believe I am going through this and I have only just begun. Yikes, it is a lot. I know the key is to keep strong and that is what I will do. Thank you and talk soon.",

I have to share that so many of us can relate and I hope that helps to hear a little bit. I do remember after meeting before even having my surgeries with the onc, I got back in the car and cried and cried and honestly even said, I am not going to do this.. I can not do this.. If anyone thinks I am doing this I am not. The fact was I was always going to do whatever I had to do and whatever I decided my plan would be and I was going to do it well. I just wasn't going to do it at that moment because at that moment I needed to do something else. I needed to cry and cry. That's just as important sometimes. I know you are going to do amazingly well because I can tell that you are so very, very, very strong. You are going to be quite incredible and as some others have shared with me are going to come out of this being even stronger than before. I know you are. You are in my prayers. Talk soon. Michelle, wow, wow, wow! You are amazing, too! I am so happy for you.:) Hugs to all. Have a great day! Does anyone do the big, early shopping tomorrow for the holidays? In years past, I stay up late tonight and check out all the sales in the fliers and go out in the morning to try to get a couple deals. I think I am still going to go for old times sake. It is fun, but I don't go crazy. Is that something that people do across the country and in other countries? Or is it just a local thing? Now that I actually think about it, getting up at 4 a.m. and lining up outside a store in freezing cold weather with other crazy shoppers to get the one item that has a big sale price sounds absurd, but I probably will do it! Have a great day!",

It is just a great reason to celebrate. Meece, how did your cookies turn out? What kind did you bake? Suz3, I have been going to an acupuncturist regularly since I have been diagnosed with BC. He recently mentioned that tai chi is just great to try. Did you mention in earlier posts that you do tai chi (spell?) ",

We have had a couple appointments and the onc is recommending Taxol and Herceptin. I am very nervous about beginning treatment and with the surgery part of things taking longer than we thought I quite frankly think I am in shock that this next step is beginning... and so soon. I am scared and am praying for peace, trust and strength. Any advice is very appreciated and respected. I am wondering if I should try to pack a bag with some things in it for the visit. Any suggestions on what to pack?  :) ",
