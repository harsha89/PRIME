This remedies itself when my bra is off and doesnt happen when I'm not wearing a bra. My right nipple also seems to be erect more than my left nipple. I have been to GP and nurse has referred me but I'm extremely worried. Thanks for reading. Any advice will be much appreciated x Log in to post a reply",
