All of my doctors (onc, rad onc and family dr) have said that radiation would help considerably with the pain. I have had chronic lymphedema in the arm for several years and have had several bouts with cellulitis. I had 26 rad treatments on my left arm and chest ten yrs ago after my original dx. My rad onc said she is afraid that radiation might make my lymphedema worse and make my arm swell even more. Currently the swelling is minimal in my hand, but is worse further up on my arm. At the worst point, the swelling is nearly 2 cm larger than my good arm. Dr gave me tramadol and then hydrocodone when the pain got worse. I try to suffer thru it during the day because it makes me so drowsy, but at night I can't get to sleep without it.  Have any of you had rad treatment to an arm that has had previous lymphedema/cellulitis problems? If so, did the lymphedema get worse? Jan Diagnosis 12/2001: IDC, 3.9 cm, Stage IIB, 0/8 nodes, ER+, PR+, HER2-. Bone and lung mets discovered 1/13/12.

She seems to think the need to stop the mets from progressing and causing any more deterioation to my shoulder outweighs the risk of side effects. She feels there is a good chance the rads will either increase my LE problems or cause skin problems (tough, leathery skin) in the areas that she radiated 10 yrs ago. I'm pretty sure that stereotactic rads and Cyber Knife are not offered here, but I will look into it. She ordered a new xray of my shoulder to compare to the old one and see how fast the bones are deteriorating. She's going to call me tomorrow to let me know. I've been searching for info online tonight and most of what I've found is fairly negative. Unless the xray shows a lot of bone deterioration, I think I'm going to wait. My LE swelling is as low as it's been in years, partly due to the weight loss I've had. For a couple of years it was pretty bad with several bouts of cellulitis. I honestly think I would rather deal with the shoulder pain than go back to that. ma111, what is the name of the machine you have and where are they sold? I also saw my family dr today and both he and my rad onc feel I should have thoracentesis done to get rid of the fluid on my lungs. My SOB has gotten worse over the past few days and it's been difficult to keep my O2 sats above 90% without oxygen, even during the day. My fam dr said that if I don't have the fluid drained I need to get portable O2. I think this takes priority over the pain in my shoulder and I honestly can't deal with both right now. This disease can be such a nightmare! Jan",

I will check the LE forum. cookiegal, I never had a bit of trouble with LE until I moved a bunch of wood with a wheel barrow and stacked it. About three days later, my arm swelled and I've had trouble ever since. I never have as much trouble with my hand. For a long time my wrist was swollen enough that I was not able to wear my wrist watch, but it's had very little swelling for quite a while. The further up my arm, the worse the swelling is. The fluid tends to pool in my lower upper arm. Wrapping helps a lot, but it's such a pain!! Since my orginal post on this thread, my rad onc ordered an xray of my left shoulder. The deterioration has moved into the socket, so she said the area she will radiate will mostly be new (not previously radiated) and the area that she radiated 10 yrs ago is a smaller area than she had originally planned on doing. Right now I'm having problems with fluid on my lungs and I'm currently in the hospital to have the fluid drained...so the radiation is going to have to wait.

I'm just guessing here about the dosage, but unless a doctor would give a much-reduced dose, no chemo treatment is considered as palliative. Usually when a cancer patient goes to palliative care, they are not given chemotherapy of any kind. I have bone and lung mets and have been battling fluid build-up from pleural effusions in both lungs for the past year. This past Monday I started my third round of GemZar (gemcitabine). In August I had a pleural catheter placed in my right lung so I could drain the fluid myself. Within a little over a month, the fluid in my right lung dried up and no new fluid came into my lung. I had the catheter removed and had one placed in my left lung. Now I'm no longer able to get any fluid when I try to drain it and will have it removed soon. No new fluid is coming into either lung. GemZar is the only treatment I've received, so it has to be responsible for the fluid stopping. My latest tumor marker test went up 2 pts. My onc said a rise of only 2 pts is considered stable. The previous tumor marker test came down from 209 to 164. I will be getting scanned after completing this round (3 treatments). I have only taken one other chemo (Navelbine) since my stage iv diagnosis. It worked to some degree for a while and then stopped so I was switched to GemZar. I am not getting palliative care and my onc is using GemZar in hopes of killing my cancer, not just keeping me stable.  What may have you confused is the fact that GemZar (as well as Navelbine) is among the chemo drugs that have milder side effects than some of the others. I haven't lost my hair and have not had serious problems with nausea, skin problems, and the other SE's that some of the harsher chemo drugs cause. My counts, however, dropped on both drugs. Navelbine took my WBC's way down. GemZar caused my WBC's and platelets to drop slightly and my RBC's dropped so low that I had to be given a drug to help rebuild my them.  Both drugs also caused fatigue. Many members have had very good results with GemZar and have had very little trouble with side effects. Maybe they will post their experiences with it. I hope GemZar works well for you. Jan",

I've had Crohn's Disease since I was in my early 20's. For years I suffered horribly off and on with abominal symptoms (pain & cramping, nausea, diarrhea) before I had surgery at age 31. I've had some rough times since my stage iv dx, but I suffered much more pain and discomfort when my CD was at its worst than I've had with my cancer. The surgery put me in remission and since then I only have an occasional flare-up. In an earlier post you said you had good results from Halaven but you couldn't tolerate the SE's. It is working very well for me and other than problems with WBC & RBC counts. My dr reduced my dosage a little bit and I currently have very few problems with it. I also get regular shots of Neulasta and Aranesp to boost my counts which really help. During the first few treatments I had times when I was pretty miserable with fatigue, but that eased up when they started giving me the shots. Have you talked to your dr about trying a reduced dose of Halaven? I hope your doctor can find a way to ease the pain and pressure until he can find a chemo that will work better. Jan",

I started my second round of GemZar (three wks on/1 wk off) on Tuesday.  My local cancer center uses oncologists who come in for weeks/months at a time. The one who is here now is the one I started with and I have more faith in him than the others that have been here. He had not seen me since the end of July. He said he can definitely see that the skin mets on my shoulder are smaller and much lighter in color. Some that were starting to form just before he left have disappeared. The surgeon who put the PleurX catheters in my lungs had to remove the one in my right lung after 6 wks because no more fluid was draining. He also said he thought the GemZar was working because something was stopping any new fluid from accumulating in my pleural effusions. My onc ran tumor markers on Tues and they should be back later today or tomorrow. I'll wait for the results before I get my hopes built up. I hope they're right and that it is working because it's such an easy chemo (so far). If the GemZar is not working or stops working, I want to try AI's next and I think I want to start with Femara. It seems to have worked well for a lot of people. While I was getting my chemo tx on Tues I read an interesting article on estrogen in Cure magazine.

Here are some stats that show the recurrence rate nearly doubles between 5 and 10 years. I found that rather shocking and I'm sure your readers would too. \"Roughly 20 percent of breast cancer survivors who have finished five years of additional cancer treatment after their initial therapy will have a recurrence within 10 years of their treatment, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Overall, 11 percent of women will suffer a recurrence at five years and 20 percent at 10 years, the ACS says.\" http://www.livestrong.com/article/55159-statistics-breast-cancer-recurrence/ Jan",

I've gone septic once with peritonitis from my Crohn's Disease and twice from chemo tx during my original cancer treatment 10 yrs ago, so I know first-hand how serioius it is. I was in the hospital when I developed peritonitis and went septic, otherwise I probably wouldn't have survived it. With my first chemo tx, my onc didn't prepare me well enough for what to watch for and I let a fever go for several days before I called him. By that time I was in really bad shape -- out of my head, didn't know where I was or who my husband was. Was in the hospital for nearly a week. I also had a close friend whose 6-yr-old daughter died from sepsis when she came down with chicken pox right after having the flu. Even when I wasn't taking chemo, every time I've gotten cellulitis in my lymphedema arm, my dr went into a panic and tried to hospitalize me because he was so afraid I'll go septic. All three times that I was septic, they put me on IV antibiotics. Sepsis can progress very fast and is very serious...and it's even more dangerous for you because of the c-diff. Please get some help before it gets more serious. Jan",

I completely understand your fear of setting yourself up for a fall, but think of all the women on the board who have been NED for many years. All it takes is that one drug that works and it looks like you've found it. Be cautious and watch for any sign of recurrence, but stay positive. Maybe as time goes on and you remain NED you will be able to believe it's for real. Maybe seeing another onc to confirm your results will make you feel better about it. I get the feeling you are not 100% happy with your current onc, so now might be a good time to look for a new one, esp since he's not being very helpful with your fatigue problems. Dealing with this disease is hard enough without having things made worse by a dr you're not 100% confident with. Bless your funny kid! Jan",

During the 2nd cycle I started feeling so much better overall and ever since I have felt better than I have in many months. This is by far the most tolerable chemo I've taken. No nausea issues, no increased neuropathy and no distorted taste which makes eating a pleasant experience again. Last month's TM's went down only 3 pts, but stable is good. I have a lung CT scheduled for Feb 19th to see how well it's working on my lungs. I had more problems with fatigue during my first cycle. That has eased up with each cycle. My biggest problem is the impact it has on my blood counts. So far it hasn't attacked my platelets, but it hits my RBC's and WBC's pretty hard. I get booster shots for both (Anaresp for RBC's & Neulasta for WBC's) which really help. Previously I was on Navelbine and then Gemzar. Both worked for a month or so and then quit. My onc told me 49% lose their hair on Halaven. So far I've been one of the lucky ones. My hair had thinned quite a bit on Navelbine and Gemzar, but has started to grow back in on the Halaven. I hope Halaven works well for all of you.:) Jan",

My hemoglobin was down from 10.3 to 9.3. No chemo that week, so the RBC drop was most likely caused by the cancer. They called me after they got the results and I had to go in the next day to get a shot of Arenesp. Got 2nd tx Dec 26. Had to go back in the next day for Neulasta shot. RBC's were also down so it's a good thing I got the shot of Arenesp. Bone pain was pretty bad with 2nd tx. I'm guessing it was caused by the Neulasta and XGeva instead of the Halaven. The first night I had pain in left hip which is new. It's just about gone now. Still having lots of rib pain, esp on left (cancer side) and left shoulder. I feel pretty good, though. I'm off next week and then start cycle 2 on Jan 9.

Yesterday I started feeling better and today I felt pretty good. My WBC's were pretty low, so I'm guessing that's why this treatment hit me so hard. My other treatments have been pretty easy. Now for the good news! I had a CT scan done on Feb 19th. It showed my lung mets are stable and so are the bone mets that are visible on the chest CT. Before and after the last treatment, I've felt better than I have in months. I'm breathing better, I'm gaining a little weight and my skin mets are continuing to shrink. I posted my scan results in another thread, but I wanted to include it in this thread, too. Looks like I've finally found a drug that is going to work for me. Just hope the next treatment won't be so hard on me. Jan",

Thanks for posting the info on POTS, sunny. I really don't think that's what I'm experiencing. From what I read online, POTS causes SOB when a person goes from a lying-down position to an upright position. I will have no SOB while sitting, get up to do something and get SOB. The longer I'm up or the more I move around, the more breathless I get. If I sit down, it immediately begins to ease up and after several minutes, my 02 will be back in the high 90's. Jan",

I don't know if it's a coincidence, but the first ones popped up on my left shoulder after my first Faslodex treatment. From Feb 2012 until Aug 2012 I had five bumps that formed a circle. One of them was biopsied and was positive for breast cancer. For several months they had no discoloration. After several months they began to turn a little darker than the surrounding skin with a bit of a reddish cast to them. Faslodex didn't work for me, so I was switched to Navelbine which worked for a while and then quit. I started Gemzar next and after my first treatment, I broke out in a rash on my left chest (original cancer was in left breast) of the same type raised bumps. They have not been biopsied, but onc says they are skin mets. After Gemzar quit working I started Halavan in Dec 2012. After I finished the first cycle, the skin mets started shrinking. Most of the bumps on my chest have completely flattened and the ones on my shoulder (which were a lot larger than those on my chest) have shrunk considerably. My onc was amazed. Neither of the other two chemo drugs had any affect on my skin mets, but the Halavan definitely shrunk them. The bumps on my chest never did change color, but they were only there for about 4 months. Last month I had a lung CT which showed my lung mets are now stable as are the bone mets that are visible in the lung CT. Lynne, have you asked your onc about radiating your rash? Radiation was recommended by my onc when I just had the skin mets on my shoulder. My shoulder was radiated in 2002 when I had my original breast cancer and radiating an area that has already been radiated can cause problems, so I didn't look into having any more radiation. MzMerz, at times mine itch and sting a little bit. Jan",

The life insurance policy I had thru my employer was automatically accelerated when my SS disability was approved. I can't remember for sure, but I believe I only had to pay state taxes on it.

I've also had chronic anemia caused by Gemzar since Oct. After several thoracenteses and finally placement of PleurX catheters, pleural effusions have been under control for a couple of months. Last chest xray about 10 days ago showed almost no fluid in the pleura of either lung and onc says I'm moving air very well in both lungs. SOB eased up a little bit for a while, but not nearly as much as I had hoped. Now it's back, sometimes as bad as it's ever been. Even while wearing oxygen, on any kind of exertion I'm back to having some degree of SOB and fast heartbeat. Sometimes it's pretty severe and my heart races as high as 144. Ever since I first started having trouble with this (months ago) I haven't been able to figure out if my SOB/low 02 sats are causeed by my rapid heartbeat or anemia or if my SOB is causing my rapid heartbeat. None of the dr's I've asked have been able to give me a clear answer. I'm currently on chemo break and it will be 2 wks Mon since my last Gemzar tx and the fatigue the chemo had been causing has just about completely gone away. Last hemoglobin (a wk ago) was 9.4 which isn't too bad.  I had several good days earlier this week and then last night and today my SOB has been pretty bad. Several drs seem to think I have lung damage either from one of the chemo drugs I've taken in the past or the Gemzar I'm taking now. Since this has been a problem for several months, I tend to think it's not being caused by the Gemzar, although it may be making it worse. Has anyone else had SOB with low 02 sats as well as rapid heartbeat? If so, which do you think starts the problem -- SOB/low 02 or rapid heartbeat?

I did have an echocardiogram about 10 months ago that didn't show anything and that was when my SOB was at its worst. If you have low blood pressure can you still take a beta blocker? My BP runs low (as low as 90/60). So far none of my drs that I mentioned my heart rate to have seemed concerned about it, but they may not believe me when I tell them how high it gets. I've also wondered if they think a heart problem isn't worth being treated since I have stage iv cancer. My family dr told me back in Aug that he didn't think he would recommend a feeding tube for me if I couldn't get my nutrition built up on my own. My mother had a feeding tube and she was 81 with stage iv laryngeal cancer! At least once when I was in the hospital, a nurse saw how high my heart rate was (140's) and she told me I could not sustain a heartbeat that high for very long without doing damage to my heart. Also one time when I was in to see the surgeon who implanted my PleurX catheters, he was listening to my heart and said I had a galloping heartbeat. I have a new onc and I haven't talked to him about it. I see him on Monday and I will mention it and ask about seeing a cardiologist. My SOB and fast heartbeat are my biggest issues and they extremely limit my activity. Without them I would have a pretty good QOL. Jan",

I'm very sorry that you are Stage IV, but you will find a lot of good info and comfort here.  I hope Navelbine works as well for you as it has for me. I had a CT of my lungs in late May and also had an xray of my left shoulder (where my worst bone mets are). The CT showed that my lung nodules are still gone and showed just a little bit of fluid left in my lungs. The xray showed that the bone mets in my shoulder were stable. My oncologist was very pleased and so was I! I asked him if we could try taking me off the Navelbine and putting me back on the Faslodex. He said we can give it a try and see how it goes, but he wants to overlap the two drugs since the Faslodex takes a while to kick in. This week my RBC count was low, so I didn't get a treatment. He's had me on a half-dose (20 mg) of Naveline because higher dosages were taking my white and red counts down and the fatigue was pretty bad. I'm hoping he will keep me on the reduced dose. He wants to do 3-4 more Navelbine treatments and then I'll just be on Faslodex and Xgeva. I hope the Faslodex will at least keep me stable and keep the fluid from coming back in my lungs. I hope Navelbine isn't too hard on your blood counts and that you don't have a lot of fatigue. That seems to be the worst side effect. Best of luck to you.  Jan",

After all the comments about how exercise can actually make you feel better when you feel tired, I decided to try to push myself a little more. My activity level isn't nearly as high as most of yours. Because of the SOB I get on just about any kind of activity, I have to pace myself and make sure my oxygen hasn't dropped too much. Yesterday I went downstairs to our basement and did a couple of loads of laundry and changed the sheets on our bed. I went up and down the stairs about 4 times. Today my husband and I went grocery shopping. I have to use a motorized cart at Kroger because of my SOB and my husband follows me with a regular cart. We were in the store for about an hour. Even though I'm not walking, I'm up and down quite a bit, reaching for things off the shelves, getting into areas the cart won't access, etc., and usually I'm pretty tired if we shop for very long. After we got home I put the groceries away and did a little cleaning in the kitchen. After I rested for a while, I swept my kitchen floor. I had to pace myself and sit down and rest a couple of times because of SOB. After I finished, I felt a little tired, but not too bad. I rested for a little bit and decided to mop my floor which really needed it. I was only able to do the kitchen half of it before I pooped out and I had to stop and rest several times. My kitchen/dining room area is fairly large.  After I finished I was tired, but it was a \"good\" tired, not a \"wiped out\" or \"fatigue\" tired. I never thought I could feel good about mopping a floor! LOL This may not seem like much, but the chemo has caused me to be so fatigued that I haven't been able to do much at all for several weeks and to me it was quite an accomplishment. I'm going to continue to push myself a little more each day and hopefully be able to get some strength/stamina built up. I thought resting when I felt fatigued was what I needed, but I'm convinced now that I was just making it worse. Thanks for helping me realize that. Jan",

I still have a little bit of fluid in my left lung, but less than my last chest xray showed a month ago. I've been feeling stronger and breathing much better each week which left both of my onc's shocked, but very pleased, at how quickly the Navelbine worked. My onc from  IU Med has turned me over to my local onc and I won't need to see him again unless something goes wrong.  I'm now able to go for several hours at a time without using oxygen and my sats stay 97-99! My sats still drop while I'm sleeping if I don't have my oxygen on. I also still need oxygen if I'm on my feet for long periods of time, but I've been able to reduce to my oxygen from 2 liters to one. I had my 5th Navelbine treatment today. It has taken a toll on my WBC's & RBC's, so my third treatment was 20 mg (half of what I had been receiving). My last two treatments have been 25 mg. Next week I get a break and will not get a treatment and will then start again in two weeks with 25 mg. My onc will test my tumor markers in two weeks and will repeat my scans in June. I started out on Faslodex and after just two treatments a lung CT showed that the nodules that had showed up on my previous scans were gone, but the Faslodex had no effect on my pleural effusions. Until I get re-scanned in June, I won't know how my bone mets are doing, but the pain I was having has been greatly reduced for several weeks. The pain in my left shoulder (which has shown the most damage) was pretty severe and certain movements caused excruciating pain. Now it still aches most of the time, but movement doesn't make the pain worse like it did before. So...it seems to be working on my bone mets as well. The only real problem I'm having with the Navelbine is fatigue which can be pretty severe. I'm hoping that once my blood counts come up that the fatigue will get better. It feels so great to finally have some hope that I can enjoy life again! Jan Diagnosis 12/2001: IDC, 3.9 cm, Stage IIB, 0/8 nodes, ER+, PR+, HER2-. Bone and lung mets discovered 1/13/12.

Once I was dx'd and started chemo, I couldn't stand the taste of Diet Coke, but craved anything fruity, esp lemon. I started drinking Luzienne iced tea w/ sugar and lemon and continued to drink it until I started tx for my recurrence last Jan. My taste was horribly affected and I stopped drinking it because it tasted so bad. Now that I no longer take Faslodex or Navelbine, my taste is back to normal and so far the GemZar I take has not affected my taste. I can now enjoy an occasional glass of iced tea with lemon, although it still doesn't taste as good as it used to. Is there is anything in regular tea that interferes with chemo?

I had to increase the dosage on my pain meds when the jawbond pain got so bad and that may have caused the cramping or the navelbine might have done it.

He has some very good info posted there and offers a lot of free info about his diet and other things. Apparently he was the head of the Cancer Treatment Center's of America's nutrition dept. for a few years. There are a couple of things he stresses that I've found to be wrong. First, he says cancer needs sugar to thrive and that if we cut out all sugar we will help kill our cancers (not true). Also, he says cancer cells are anaerobic (do not need oxygen to survive/cannot surive without oxygen).  He states that deep breathing adds oxygen to our blood that can keep cancer cells from thriving. This is also not true. Cancer cells can and do thrive in any amount of oxygen. They can adapt to grow in very small amounts of oxygen, but they do need a certain amount of oxygen. The information he offers on nutrition is well worth taking the time to read, though. I've never seen an author who offered so much free info about his book. Most of them throw you a crumb or two and make you buy the book to get more info. His book is still available on both Amazon and Ebay and I will probably buy a copy to get all of his info on nutrition and also his recipes. Here is a link to the nutrition area of his website: http://www.patrickquillin.com/nutritioncancer.html Thanks for posting the info on the book. Jan",

When I was 34, after being off work for 6 mos with a really bad flare-up, my dr suggested that I file for SS disability.  I was turned down (as are most people) and had to go through their appeal process. My appeal was also turned down. This was in 1985, so SS rules and procedures may have changed since then, but at that time the final appeal was a hearing. I hired an atty who specialized in SS to handle my appeal hearing and I was approved. I worked for the Teamsters union at the time and was able to receive a cash settlement for my life insurance and another one for a pension plan. I also received a monthly disability pension benefit. Since all three were disability options under my insurance and pension plans, none of them affected my SS payments. You can only qualify for the benefits you mentioned if you are sick, so they will not affect your SS. Your insurance benefits should not be taxable. If you qualify for a disability pension, it's taxable only if your employer paid 100% of the premiums. Someone mentioned unemployment benefits. In order to apply for unemployment benefits, you have to be physically able to work. Unless  their rules have changed, in order to apply for SS disability, you must claim that you are unable to work for 12 months or longer (that's the way my application read in 1985 anyway), so I don't see how you could file applications for both. If you are turned down for SS, you should definitely find an atty who specializes in SS. My atty told me that SS has certain symptoms for each disease/condition that you must have in order to be approved and the attys know what questions to ask your dr in order to get you approved. My uncle had stage IV lung cancer and his disability was approved the first go-round. I've always heard that people with stage IV cancer are always approved, so hopefully you won't have to worry about the appeals process. You should also get in touch with your union rep to see what benefits are available to you. Your union membership may have benefits that the person you talked to in your office may not be aware of. Be sure to check your pension plan to see if there is a disability benefit. Many pension plans have a disability benefit based on your years of service. Best of luck to you. Jan",

      "Content": "jcb51 wrote: Before I was dx'd stage iv, I struggled with my weight for years, losing and gaining the same 10-20 lbs over and over. I had four sets of clothes (esp jeans) -- can't-wear-it-yet-but-maybe-someday (skinny size 10 or smaller), satisfied-with-my-weight-but-would-love-to-lose-a-little-more (size 10 with thighs & hips relaxed), not-really-happy-but-I-can-live-with-it (size 12), OMG!-gotta-lose-10lbs! (size 14). I love to buy from ebay because I can find really unique things at great prices. Through the yrs I've accumulated several things that were smaller than described and I couldn't wear them. Some I gave to friends or donated to the Salvation Army, but I kept the ones I really liked and put them with my skinny size 10 clothes. Unless I was in my skinny size 10 clothes, I rarely weighed myself because it was too depressing. Instead I used my current clothing size to gauge my eating habits. I had not weighed myself in well over a year. I first started having symptoms last Aug with shoulder pain. Figured I had just sprained something so I wasn't concerned. Within several wks I developed what I thought was a chest cold/bronchitis and the shoulder pain got worse. Saw my family dr who ran shoulder and chest xrays which showed nothing. He thought my shoulder might just be arthritis and prescribed an antibiotic for my bronchitis. Was ecstatic to find I had lost 20 lbs even though I hadn't been dieting. I told DH that I was going to watch what I ate and try to lose a little more and dreamed about getting into my skinny clothes! My symptoms continued to get worse and I also began to feel more and more fatigued. Went back to dr and got another antibiotic which also didn't help much. Finally in December he ordered scans because of my past history of bc and discovered my mets. During the 5 mos when my dr was trying to figure out what was wrong, I lost about 30 lbs. I FINALLY could fit into clothing I had not worn in years -- probably even some of my \"skinniest\". Trouble was I felt too bad to dig them out or to go anywhere to wear them! I saw an onc from IU Medical Center who started me on Faslodex. By the time he figured out it wasn't working, I had developed bilateral pleural effusions and he said I needed to immediately start chemo. He prescribed Navelbine which worked for a while and then stopped. By this time I had lost another 20 lbs. Now I'm on GemZar which seems to be working. No new fluid has been forming in my pleural effusions for several wks and GemZar is the only new tx I've had. I noticed today that a lymph node which was slightly enlarged has also shrunk. :) Had a bit of a setback with a nicked lung during thoracentesis in mid-Aug which took a major toll on me, but I continue to improve and feel stronger every day. I had a PleurX catheter placed in my rt lung following the nicked lung and already (a month later) the fluid seems to be almost gone, so I may be able to have the catheter removed soon. As for my weight, after my 5-day hospitalization from the nicked lung and the toll all of the procedures I had took on me, I'm down to 92 lbs. And all those cute, \"skinny\" clothes I have been anxiously waiting to fit into? Well, the time I could wear them has come and gone and I missed it! Now most of them are too big! I haven't given up on them yet, though! So far, GemZar has not affected my taste like Navelbine did, so food tastes good to me again. Now that I'm feeling better, I need to concentrate on building up the amount I'm able to eat at a time and finding high-cal foods that taste good to me. Not sure what I believe anymore, but if there is a God, he definitely has a sense of humor. It may seem weird, but little things like this that I can laugh about make the rest of it just a little more bearable. :) Jan Diagnosis 12/2001: IDC, 3.9 cm, Stage IIB, 0/8 nodes, ER+, PR+, HER2-.

I have interstitial lung damage which is not reversible, so I will always be on oxygen. If you're sure it's okay to wean yourself from the 02, be cautious and wean yourself in baby steps. Monitor your 02 sats carefully. I was told that when your oxygen drops to 88 or lower you are straining your heart which can cause congestive heart failure. I have a 50-ft hose on my 02 tank which gives me more distance with my 02. With the long hose I can go downstairs and do a load of laundry, go into any room in our house and even sit in our porch swing on the back porch. Sometimes I don't want to drag the hose around, though, and I just take my 02 off to go to the bathroom, get something to drink from kitchen, etc. If you take short walks around the house, make sure you stay close to your oxygen cannula. I've experienced the sheer panic of not being able to get my breath, so I never get far from my cannula. When I go out for long periods of time with my portable tank, I've been experimenting with using the 1-liter setting instead of using the 2-liter setting that I normally use. If I'm not moving around a lot, I get along fine. It makes my oxygen last longer and gives me a little more freedom. Jan",

Several times I couldn't get a treatment because one of my counts would be too low or I was just too weak to get it. I've had to get IV iron twice and a transfusion once. Most of the time I've had to take Anaresp to boost my RBC's and Neulasta to boost my WBC's which help keep my counts from getting too low. Even with all the problems, it has been much easier for me than Navelbine or Gemzar and it's kept my bone & lung mets stable since Feb. I have a little nausea from time to time but meds take care of it. I've been on a break for the past 5 wks...originally because I had picked up a bug.

It won't be a problem on a job at all. I have a PleurX brand, but there is one called Aspira that might be a little better than the PleurX. It uses gravity to drain instead of the vaccuum system that PleurX uses. I had planned on getting an Aspira, but my need for one came up suddenly when I had a pneumothorax, so I went with the PleurX. I get along good with the PleurX, but if I drain the fluid too quickly or drain too much at a time, I get some pleurisy-type pain that can last several hours. It's my understanding that you don't have this problem with the Aspira. Below is the url of a board search I did for the Aspira catheter that will give you more info about it. You will also find info if you google it. http://community.breastcancer.org/posts/search?search_builder%5Bkeyword%5D=aspira&search_builder%5Bauthor%5D=&search_builder%5Bsource%5D=&search_builder%5Bdate_range%5D=&commit=Search If you have any problems with the url, click on the blue \"search\" button on the left side near the top of this page.

Went in today for my next tx and found out that my WBC's had bottomed out (lower than they've ever been) and hemoglobin went down to 8.9. Onc wouldn't give me the tx because my WBC count was so low. I was really surprised that my counts were that low because I feel good. To make matters worse, onc did tumor markers before I started back on Halaven. During the 4 wks I went with no tx, my TM's jumped from 186 to 246 -- up 60 pts! I don't notice any changes in my lungs and bones, but my skin mets have progressed. In fact, they were progressing at the time I got the scans that showed my bones and lungs were stable. I'm wondering/hoping the rise in TM is just from skin mets and that my bones and lungs are still stable, but won't know until new scans. If not, I'm thinking my cancer must be pretty aggressive to cause TM's to rise that much in just 4 wks' time...and that is terrifying.

They found bone and lung mets plus a few small lesions on my liver that so far they believe are cysts and not mets. They started me out on Faslodex which didn't work. Within a month after I had developed large bilateral pleural effusions which I had drained several times in Feb and March. Both were malignant. They started me on Navelbine which apparently worked for a while. I stopped getting new fluid in my lungs and didn't have to have them drained from March 'til late August. Navelbine is a fairly easy chemo for most. Most don't lose their hair. The worse side effect is fatigue. When they decided Navelbine had stopped working for me, they switched me to GemZar (another easy one). I just completed one 3-treatment cycle and haven't had any scans or tumor markers yet. Fluid has again stopped going to my lung, though, and nothing but the GemZar has changed. I had a PleurX catheter put in my right lung in August. I was no longer able to drain any fluid from it, so today they took it out and put a catheter in my left lung. My surgeon got 1000 ml of fluid out of it right after he put it in and I don't think he drained all that was there. I think they're only supposed to drain 1000 ml max at one time. So far I haven't had any problems with pericardial effusion. My onc told me Navelbine is a little better for lung mets than GemZar, so if you have a choice, I would push for Navelbine. Best of luck to you. Jan",

Before we started she told the class how much the university appreciated the fact that these people had donated their bodies and that they were to be treated with the utmost respect. She said anyone who made a disrespectful remark about the bodies would be immediately expelled. I am thinking about donating my body to Indiana University, but I'm still a little undecided. If I knew my body would be used for research, I would definitely do it. I did a little checking online and this is what I've found: Some of their donated bodies are used for research, but most are used for education. If they are used in undergraduate classes, only the instructor handles the body and uses it for demonstration to classes (like the ones they used in my nursing classes). If they are used by medical school students, the students dissect them and they are used over two semesters. They return the cremated remains to the family within 18-24 months. They pay for all of the expenses, including the cremation, and assist in filing of the paperwork (death certificate, obituaries, and other necessary forms) at no cost. The bodies are embalmed, but to protect the humans who will be exposed to them, the embalming process is different (a \"lighter\" version). Other universities may handle their donations differently. You should be able to find info by googling \"donate body to\" and add the university. I haven't checked, but research hospitals may have different guidelines. I did not want to be embalmed, so that kind of bothers me. I need to find out more about their embalming process before I decide. Before my bc dx I had signed up to be an organ donor, too. It really bothers me that I can no longer donate my organs. Jan",

I also had a wig but it was really hot and itchy, so the hats were more comfortable. Six months later after my mastectomy, my onc put me on taxotere and told me my hair would fall out again. My hair had come back in salt and pepper. For some reason, only the dark hair fell out, leaving me with thin gray hair, but I still had hair. My onc couldn't believe that it didn't all come out. When it came back in, it was all gray.  If I were you, I wouldn't shave your head just yet. It could be that all of your hair won't fall out. Even if it's too thin to go without a wig or your halo, having even a thin layer of hair underneath should make it more comfortable. I have a small head, too, so I can relate to your \"pinhead\" description. When I was bald I looked like the little old man from the old Benny Hill shows. One night I was sitting at my computer. About 5 feet directly in front of me was a window. I had had the window opened earlier, so the blind was raised. Suddenly I looked at the window and saw what appeared to be an old man peering in the window at me. I jumped back and started to scream for my husband. Then I realized it wasn't an old man...it was ME!!! If I would lose my hair again, I would try one of the halos, too. Most of the heat and itching from my wig was right at the top. I have a headband with bangs attached that I used to wear under caps and hats.

I was three wks on and one wk off and by the end of the third wk I could barely move I was so tired. It stopped working for me so I take GemZar now. So far it's much easier. When I was taking tamoxaphen 10 yrs ago, Vitamin E capsules helped my hot flashes. My oncologist also gave me Prozac because anti-depressants are supposed to help with hot flashes. I didn't like the way the Prozac made me feel, though, so I quit taking it. I didn't realize until later that the feelings I was having that I didn't like (feeling like an emotional zombie) were actually caused by the tamoxaphen.
