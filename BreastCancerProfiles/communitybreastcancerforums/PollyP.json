Will check back to see what you active ladies are doing to keep me on track. Did gardening this am and planning on 40 minutes on elliptical in addition to my daily LE exercises. Question: are any of you yoga enthusiasts allowed to do downward dog or plank? And what weights are you all using for your LE bicep exercises? I finally got a good report from my OT Thursday ( no big swelling to report- arm shrinking) but she wasn't sure when I asked her.",
