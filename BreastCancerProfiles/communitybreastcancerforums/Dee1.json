I was a bit surprised when the surgeon didn't offer to aspirate the lump and/or remove it.  When I asked the surgeon about it... she said... \"the lump is too small... that it would be too hard to find it with a needle\". That surprises me because... my fingers find the lump IMMEDIATELY!  My lump doesn't feel like a pea or bean... like others describe. It doesn't feel like a little rock. It just feels different... and at times I DO feel/sense a bit of soreness. I suppose I do need to get a mammogram... so at least there is something to refer to...",

I suppose I'm not different than others who question cancer.   Where is it? What is it? How do I deal with it? Why me? When should I panic? Am I in denial of WHAT I'm feeling? About a year ago... While taking a shower... I discovered a lump on my right breast... towards the upper outter side... near my armpit.  My first reaction was to deny what I felt and never to return to that part of my body.  However, that truly is impossible. Since I felt the lump its as though it was a magnet pulling my hand to it. I couldn't stop feeling it. I wouldn't stop feeling it. From my knowledge... nobody in my family has ever been diagnosed with breast cancer.  I must say.. that DID give me a teeny tiny bit of relief. But after reading about breast cancer... I realize now.. that it can happen to anybody... any age. I am 39 years old. I have NO children. Breast size... 36D.    Long story getting longer... but I promise to get to the point. I did indeed go to the doctor after I found the lump. My primary doctor sent me to get an ultrasound and referred me to a surgeon.  The ultrasound showed that there were 3 lumps.... of which 1 had grey marks in it.  I was sent to the surgeon. The surgeon quickly felt my breast...with both hands... side-to-side... up-and-down. Then looked at the ultrasound and said. \"You're fine\".  \"Nothing to worry over\".  She did give me a referral to get a mammogram. Just for the records, I was told. I didn't get the mammorgram done after people telling me that the ultrasound sees more than the mammogram.  Is a mammogram necessary IF an ultrasound sees deeper? Where:   Lump in upper right breast What:     What do I do about the lump? How:       How do I know the lump is still \"normal\"? Why:      Why did the lump become a lump? Why didn't the surgeon want the lump removed?  When:    When do I stop worring? Log in to post a reply",

Better in a jar... than in me..... But having said that.... I have read many times... that scar tissue can be quite a problem too. Sooooo.... is it better to deal with the lump... or deal with the scar tissue?",

If your lumps shrink and swell with your menstrual period - well, cancer doesn't shrink like that - cancer is 'uncontrolled growth'. \" I found one lump on my right breast... but when I had the ultrasound done... it found 3 lumps (cysts). One lump had some grey in it???? Anyway.... from what I'm feeling... the lump feels the same to me. Same size... same location. What does differ... is sometimes I feel soreness. But, I think its a montly thing... as both breast feel sore. So.... if the lump (cysts) stay the same size.... should I be more or less concerned?  The one thing I've noticed... it doesn't/hasn't gone away or gotten smaller.",
