I had a lumpectomy in late April and started chemo in mid-June. Last chemo was August 17. Started radiation right after Labor Day and completed it toward the end of October. Started daily Arimidex November 9 (for at least the next 5 years). Gratefully, no bad side effects from it at this time. Had long, thick, beautiful dark (colored to cover gray) hair prior to chemo. Loss of hair was fairly traumatic. It was wavy and I blew it straight. Now at 5+ months PFC I have medium gray hair (no surprise there), very thick (great coverage) hair. Had been pretty straight throughout the regrowth, but is now getting wavy in the back. Top and sides are still straight. All is very soft (my 16 year old daughter loves to massage my head...LOL). I'm still wearing the shmata on my head (never liked wearing the beautiful wigs that the insurance company paid for...better they should have paid more for my out of network surgeon...don't ge me started on that) when I go to work and out in the community. Now that I have some significant hair (though short, like Annie Lenox), I am thinking it is time to go to my colorist and get back to dark brown. My colorist used permanent color the past several years since the semi-perm didn't always \"take.\" Is it okay at 5+ months PFC to use a permanent color? It would be nice to look younger again! Did anyone else have the experience of the waves coming in this late in the regrowth process? Did any of you have the waves and then they eventually went back to your old normal hair? Re: brows and lashes...last them right after the last of my 4 chemos. They came back within about a month or so. This was definitely the time I felt that I looked like a chemo-mom. They have not fallen out again and I am keeping my fingers crossed on this one. I feel like I know many of you already and, again, thank you for your encouragement and inspiration all these months. ",

I finally went and had my hair colored and trimmed today. I am 7 months pfc. My hair had been colored my \"natural\" brown color for about 10 years. Yes, I assumed it would come in gray post-chemo (I am in my late 50's) and it did. Prior to chemo I had beautiful thick, mildly wavy (I blew it straight) hair just past my shoulders. I have a wonderful colorist and I love her. But after the hair was colored (and then trimmed/shaped by my stylist of 11 years), the color looked flat. Even my colorist said it looked \"very mousy.\" So she took me in the back again and added high lights to \"warm it up.\" I had never had highlights before. Now I think it looks like a color that doesn't exist in nature. I put my shmata back on and don't know when I'll ever be able to take it off again. I can't stop crying. I had my hair done today because I'm taking some time off from work and Monday we are going to rent a car and look at colleges with our 16 year old daughter. I really wanted to look like a normal mom again for this little trip and now I feel like I look freakish. I live in Manhattan and I go to a very reputable place for my hair. In the past I have always felt my prettiest when I have walked out of the salon, and this time I just looked horrible. I managed to smile and say thank you after they did it the second time. Everyone stayed late to help out with doing my hair the second time. I don't know what to do now. Again, I apologize for complaining, but I was so excited leading up to today, couldn't wait to leave work and relax at the salon, and now this! All I want it to have a normal color (and a decent style by September). Any thoughts/suggestions? (Mere commisseration welcome is welcome). Deborah",
