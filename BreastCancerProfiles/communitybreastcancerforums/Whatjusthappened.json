    "Content": "Whatjusthappened wrote: Hi all,  I just completed my 20th treatment (out of 33 total) and everyone was commenting on how good my skin still looked, and how most people don't look as good this far in.  I started thinking about all the vitamins I take, which include several antioxidants.  I have been taking them for years, so I don't give much thought to it any more.  Anyway, I started reading some opposing studies about whether or not antioxidants decrease the effectiveness of radiation therapy.  I'm thinking I should have stopped taking them before starting therapy, but no one really asked me about what vitamins I took and I didn't think to mention it.   Has anyone been told to stop taking/ keep taking supplements?  I'm concerned that I might have inadvertently decreased the effectiveness of my therapy.
