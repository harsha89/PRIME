My first two meds I will start on are Adriamycin and Cytoxan every 2 weeks x 4 times, then I will move on to Taxol and Herceptin every week for 12 weeks, then Herceptin alone every 3 weeks for 9 months. I am veeerrryyy nervous about the whole thing and I joined this website to find somebody going through the same thing as I. I just had a modified radical mastecomy on my right breast and a power port placed on the left side of chest just yesterday. Everything seems to be moving so quickly and a lot of times I feel so lost? Well maybe we can go through this together...? What day do you begin chemo and what medications will be part of your treatment?",
