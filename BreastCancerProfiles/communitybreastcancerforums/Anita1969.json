      "Content": "Anita1969 wrote: Hi you guys, I know I can always count on you for some sage advice, a cyber-tissue and HOPE. I have lately been on Gemzar and Herceptin. Herceptin for a while. My new ONC did not feel my dose of Gemzar was enough. I had a scan last week. Well, the results are in and she was right. Everything is a little bigger. (Liver mets) So much so that we decided to bale on Gemzar and stop Herceptin in favor of Xeloda and Tykerb. There is some question about bone mets. I was originally dx 7/06 - Stage IV, Her2+, liver mets and possible bone mets. Bone scan came back clean, CT scan shows bone concerns. In May, I had another bone scan and it too came back clean. Liver biopsy another story. I had a CT on 8/8/07. That is when everything was bigger and the CT continues to show bone mets(?). So ONC ordered another bone scan for next week to get a baseline for these new drugs (and possibly start me on Zometa). Ladies, I need some positive energy and prayers. I have a little boy, 4 1/2. This diagnosis still (a year later) seems like some outrageously insane awful nightmare. Any helpful hints or things I should be on the look out for with these meds? Tykerb once a day 21 days, 1250 mg; Xeloda 2000 mg twice a day 14 days on, 7 days off. I am just really frustrated and sad and scared right now. Anita Log in to post a reply",

He's recommended 4-6 months of more chemo. Abraxane. I tolerate it reasonably well. My fingerbeds get sore and 5 are lifting, but that is all really. I am depressed about it though. I knew more chemo was a very likely after surgery, but that came as a blow. Anyone have any encouragement to share?",
