      "Content": "notanisland wrote: This is my first post. On 3/3/17 my Gyn was alarmed at the hard mass in my left breast and scheduled me for my annual mammogram plus an ultrasound, as well as a followup appt with a breast surgeon (to see if she felt a needle biopsy was called for.) This mass had first been noticed by my PCP in August of 2015 (after a clear mammogram that noted I have dense breast tissue). A subsequent ultrasound in October 2015 showed nothing suspicious and the Radiologist at the time said I could pursue a needle biopsy but that she thought I might just have very fibrous breasts. In April of 2016 my mammogram was again clear. I suspect this is why another ultrasound was not ordered, though the mass was still there. In hindsight, I wish I had done more - ask for another ultrasound in 2016 or had the biopsy to begin with, but I was so relieved to hear that nothing showed, I let it go. On 4/7 I went to my hospital's women's clinic for a 3-D mammogram, an ultrasound and a dexa (bone) scan. There were 2 adjacent \"lesions\" in the left breast that looked abnormal and the Radiologist scheduled me for a core needle biopsy on 4/10. When I arrived I learned he had also seen something in a lymph node and would biopsy it as well. By 4/12 I got the results back - all three biopsies had come back positive and I have IDC. When my GYN delivered the news she described it as invasive and metastatic, which made my heart stop. It was my understanding that being in the lymph made it (at this point) at least Stage III, but not metastatic until it was seen in other organs. When I questioned this (on the verge of hysteria) she backed off and said that she was not a cancer expert and was now turning me over to the breast surgeon who would connect me with an oncologist when appropriate. The only good news I got that day was when my PCP called to tell me that my dexa scan looked good and showed improvement in my bones. As others have noted, the waiting is the hardest. I have gone through (still AM going through) shock, numbness and anxiety in the past 5 days and have another 4 to go before my appt with the surgeon. I'm trying to maintain some normalcy and manage fairly well in meetings and social situations. I'm also trying to stay current with my work though because I work at home I can't always keep my fear and distraction at bay. This website and forum has helped me a lot. My husband is being supportive in a quiet way. He knows I have no answers so doesn't ask questions - just makes sure I eat (fear has destroyed my appetite) and get rest, and has let me know that he will take off from work whenever I have a doctor's appt. Yesterday he even went with me to get a pneumonia vaccination that my PCP recommended since surgery is definitely in my future. We haven't yet told our 30-year-old daughter. I know she will be devastated. At age 6 she witnessed her grandmother's (my mother's) recovery from pancreatic cancer that was thankfully caught early; and 8 years later, her battle with terminal lung cancer. I plan to tell my daughter about my diagnosis on Wednesday evening, after I see the surgeon. It's not a great time to break the news to her as she will be going out of town two days later, but no time is a good time. I may be more worried about my daughter than anything else right now. I recall how hard it was for me to go through this with my own mother - I barely slept, had a difficult time at work and at home, went through all the stages of grief... I've read here that we, as cancer patients, shouldn't be hesitant to ask our doctor for Ativan, but what about our loved ones? What can we/they do to alleviate their anxiety, fear, depression, sleeplessness? Thank you for this forum, for being here to \"listen\" and hopefully share your wisdom and experiences.

I've given myself a 5 day headache from holding my emotions in check, but a good cry is such a release. I don't have a copy of my report yet and my Gyn and PCP seemed to have only the basic info. I will definitely ask for a copy when I see the surgeon Wednesday and from now on. I'll also arm myself with many questions that I've only become aware of since reading through this incredible forum. Thank you too for the explanation of local metastasis vs. Metastatic Breast Cancer. All of the terminology is so new to me and I'm realizing how important it is for me to master. You are so right about my giving hopeful cues to my daughter. Whatever I learn from the surgeon, whatever next steps and plans result, I will assure her that I will do whatever I can to get through this. And I will tell her that I've found a wonderful community of people willing to share and give me support. As I start this journey I hope to be able to return the favor soon. Enjoy your Easter!

My list of questions for the surgeon is growing and I'm beginning to realize that they all won't be answered right away. A number of them will have to await referral to an oncologist and other specialists, which may take weeks of appts, decisions, planning before any type of treatment (forgive my longhand, I'm not up to speed on using abbreviations and may use them incorrectly!). First reaction is panic and wanting to get the surgery done, especially since I already know there is node involvement. But I can also see the benefit of chemo first, so will gather a good team to work with, try to be patient and attentive, carefully consider the options, and try not to apply anyone else's experience to my own situation. I'm so intent on doing everything I can that I've gotten ahead of myself. Key now is to calm down and prepare for my appt. Thank you to you and others for helping me to rein in the panic so I can betterhear and understand my doctors.",

I had no idea that I wasn't supposed to take any vaccinations before talking with an oncologist, or that I should avoid contact with people who have been recently vaccinated. I will definitely avoid crowds and visits prior to and throughout chemo and surgery. I am already very susceptible to sinusitis and have ongoing issues with a post-nasal cough that makes it very difficult for me to stay still through an MRI. I would worry about catching a cold, flu or sinusitis turning into a sinus infection, especially before surgery or during chemo when my resistance and immunity will be low. Do you think it's alright that I get together with family tomorrow for Easter? They don't know of my diagnosis yet and I was hoping to enjoy a special occasion with them before I see the surgeon on Wednesday and treatment plans are set into motion.",

Like ParakeetsRule I was concerned about the close timing, but my MO's nurse practitioner says it will be ok, and that when she worked in the hospital it wasn't unusual to have port placement and infusion on the same day. Right now I'm also more anxious about port placement than chemo, but that's probably because it's the next step in this frightening process! Dodgers Girl, what a great result post AC3! I'm so happy for you! Msrobin58, Thank you for the updates. So helpful to know what you're experiencing. Even tho I know my experience may be very different, I go into this feeling that I can and will get through it too - and with preparation and luck, maybe without severe SEs. I'm spending this week shopping and preparing. Anastasia Eyebrow Kit, SPF 50 Lotion, Lip balm, OPI Nail Envy strengthener, BPA-free water bottles, silk satin pillow cases, Sea Bands. The cotton sleeping caps look comfortable and I'll be ordering some. I'm not a hat or headscarf person and look terrible in them, but will order a few for wearing at home. Despite working from home and going through chemo during the hot summer months, I will be purchasing a wig for meeting with clients and going out in general. Just my personal preference. I don't think I have the confidence to be looked at. My prescriptions are ready to pick up: Compazine (nausea), Lorazepam (nausea and insomnia), Protonix (gastric irritation), Senna-s (constipation). OTC purchases include Magnesium Citrate, Imodium AD, Claritin, Tylenol & Advil, Biotene mouthwash and dry mouth spray, Cottonelle wipes. Food shopping on the weekend. And I'll pack my chemo bag with water bottles, snacks, Angel mints and ginger candy, hand sanitizer, wipes, travel blanket and pillow and a good book (believe it or not my onc clinic doesn't offer wifi!) For an additional mouth rinse to Biotene, my nurse practitioner advised mixing 1 qt water with a tsp of baking soda and a tsp of salt. Use after eating and at bedtime throughout treatment. I'll be back often to keep up with everyone. Wishing all the very best!  ",

I had been nervous about it the past few weeks when I read about how uncomfortable, even painful it was for some. But by the time I walked into the hospital this morning I was totally calm. Maybe because I had delayed it 5 days to enjoy a family \"reunion\" and Mother's Day with my daughter, I was finally ready. I think that my acceptance combined with the skill of my nurses and the interventional radiologist who performed the port placement helped it to go very smoothly. Unless I press on the incision on my chest or neck, I have no pain, no aches, no discomfort. The only thing that's slightly bothersome is the \"pulling\" of the bandage - and that's not worth complaining about. I'll go back in 3 days for a quick check and then straight to my oncologist's clinic for labs, pre-meds and my first round of AC chemo. If that goes even a fraction as well as the port placement, I'll be grateful! So I'm going to start meditating, and finding calm and acceptance now! I hope ParakeetsRule and NCBeachGirl did well at their first infusions. And I wish the best for all who are starting or have already started chemo this month.",

Day #1 went really well. My chemo nurse told me that the steroids might keep me from sleeping but I didn't have a problem. Day #2 I had a slight headache, but I've been trying to cut out coffee (I'm a longtime black coffee addict, which may have contributed to this mess I've gotten into! My GYN has been telling me for years that caffeine promotes dense breasts) so caffeine withdrawal may be the cause. I had to go back in to the Onc Clinic to get my Neulasta shot because they don't have the pod for automatic delivery. So hard to judge when to take the Claritin so that it's timed 30\"-60\" before the injection when you have a car ride and possible wait. I ended up taking it only 15\" prior. But don't worry about forgetting to take the Claritin, Carmstr835 - my chemo nurse told me that the bone pain usually doesn't kick in right away, so as long as you take the Claritin before it starts, it should help. I hope we don't get the bone pain at all like DodgersGirl, but I'll be vigilant with the Claritin after reading MamaEnki's experience with bone pain on Day 9. Oh, I'm so sorry, MamaEnki. I hope it's getting better. The only SE I had on Day #2 was suddenly feeling tired at 6pm. Still managed to eat dinner and watch some TV before nodding off. But I must have gotten up 8 times to pee between 9:00 and 4:30! As soon as I got up I checked my BP and it was fine. Also took out my \"Call the Doctor\" list and noted that I am to call for \"Frequent Urination in Small Amounts,\" which was not the case. I must have overdone it with the water! So, today is Day #3 and I haven't had any nausea so far. Lovepugs77, my appetite hasn't diminished and yes, the steroids seem to have made me hungrier (just as my chemo nurse warned). No wonder my MO said that some gain weight on chemo. In case the steroids run out and I hit the wall tomorrow, I'd better get some exercise today. Thanks for that warning, TooQuiet! And Limonia, thank you for the nutrition tips and links. Since I haven't experienced any nausea so far, I should be eating smart instead of eating anything. I feel very lucky so far. No problems with mouth sores. I use a soft toothbrush, Biotene toothpaste and Biotene mouth rinse twice a day and rinse with the water, baking soda, salt solution after eating. As noted before, I drink a lot of water (maybe not so much after last night!), eat protein and fresh fruits and vegetables (I'll switch to cooked produce only by Day #7 when my WBC will be at its lowest). No chills, fever, constipation, diarrhea...but I realize these are early days. I'll enjoy the present and continue to be vigilant! DodgersGirl is so right - Knowledge is Power! Thank you to all for sharing your concerns, experiences and knowledge. It makes this road a little easier to travel.",

No side effects to complain about except for one afternoon/evening of fatigue that I bounced back from the next morning. But I obviously didn't have everything figured out, so today turned out to be a disappointment. My first AC chemo was on 5/18. I return to the oncology clinic every \"day after AC\" to have a Neulasta shot. About one week after Neulasta, I go back in for a blood test to see how my white blood cells are faring. I've been feeling so great that I assumed I would ace today's labs. But what I realize now is that how good I feel has no correlation to whether my white blood cell count is up. Of course it wouldn't. White blood cells fight infection. There's no way for me to tell if they're high or low except by a blood test. (Silly me.) So I went in for the blood test today and guess what? My WBC is about as low as you can go without having ZERO immunity. It was .03. My nurse practitioner said that the good thing is we know that the AC chemo is working, because that's one of the things it does - destroys white blood cells. On the other hand, it looks like the Neulasta hasn't kicked in yet for me. I asked her what most people come back with a week later and she said a WBC of 1.0. What?! And I'm at .03?! My NP said that one of the lab results shows that white blood cell production is starting, but hasn't actually risen. And she said that if I had plans for the Memorial Day weekend, they are better cancelled. She wants me cut out all raw fruits or veggies for the next few days. I'm to wash my hands often and well with antibacterial soap (after I got rid of all the antibacterial stuff in the house because I thought it was bad for us). If I have to stop at the drug store or the market, I'm to wear a mask. And I may want to wear a mask at home as well, since if my husband caught a cold, he would be contagious before showing symptoms. I'll go in next Thursday for my #2 AC Chemo - but if my labs show that my WBC is still low, no chemo that day. I really don't want things held up! But I'm glad my MO and NP schedule these one week labs and appointments - or I might've gone to a big party this weekend and caught something. With a WBC of .03 I'm shocked that I haven't already! MsRobin - be happy with your MO's decision to blood test a week out too - because it may not be the fault of the Neulasta pod. I was given Neulasta as a shot in the arm at the clinic and it's taking a while to get to work on my bone marrow! I hope your WBC is way up there next week! Have a Good Long Holiday Weekend, Ladies!",

For me, AC #4 will be 6/29, and though I have little to complain about, I will be glad to put neutropenia behind me. My very low neutrophil count from about Day 5 through Day 10 hasn't caused me any discomfort, but the self-imposed isolation has been frustrating and difficult to understand (Why does Neulasta take so long to work on me?). My NP tells me that Taxol will more than likely not affect my WBC like AC has. Plus, my Taxol regimen will be 12 treatments over 12 weeks and not DD (my AC treatments are DD). But there's always the neuropathy to worry about. So I'm crossing my fingers and toes, sending up prayers and visualizing the best case scenario for all of us.

It helps a lot to be aware of possible SEs as well as your solutions so that those of us following can be proactive. Lovepugs: You and I have identical chemo schedules. It's always interesting to me to know how you're doing and how our experiences compare. So far, so good! Once again, the neutropenia from my 4th and final DD AC resolved in time for my next scheduled infusion and I had my first of 12 weekly Taxol treatments on 7/13. Everything went smoothly. On Day 3 I'm still feeling fine, no muscle pain or neuropathy. No SEs at all, just as with AC treatments 1 and 2 - though I am expecting that at least mild effects will be cumulative as they were with AC treatments 3 and 4. I still have loss of taste, some blackening of nail beds, darkening of hands including palms, and of course, hair loss (though that seems to be slowing). My eyebrows and lashes are hanging in there, but from what others report, they may still go! My pre-treatment blood test showed my potassium level was a bit low so I'm making an effort to eat more potassium-rich foods, which isn't difficult. And though it's not proven to prevent neuropathy, I'm going to start taking alpha lipoic acid (600 mg) and B12 (500 mg) daily. Unlike DD AC, which I had every other week, my Taxol treatments will be given weekly. This means I won't have my WBC monitored at nadir during an \"off week\" and I hope my counts don't plummet like they did on AC. I won't know until I return next Thursday for pre-labs, whether I can proceed with Taxol 2, but I've always bounced back in time before so I'm hopeful. My greatest concern is that DD AC is complete and my cancer has not shrunk as much as I had hoped it would. My chemo is neo adjuvant - prior to surgery - in hopes of shrinking the tumor estimated at 4cm X 3cm and a 1cm met to at least one biopsied lymph. After AC #2, a physical exam estimated the tumor at 2cm X 2cm (personally, I think that's an optimistic estimate) and since then there has been no palpable difference in size. The tumor does feel noticeably \"softer,' which is positive, but I'm really hoping it continues to shrink over the next 11 weeks. This journey started for me on April 14 (DX), 3 months ago. I've reached the 1/2-way mark in chemo with less than 3 months to go. Up to now I've told myself that this is something that I have to do. But today I realized that it's something I can do. Thank you for all your help! Hope you're all having a good weekend.",

My week after Taxol 1 (Thurs, 7/13) didn't go as well as I had hoped and it had nothing to do with neutropenia. The premed steroid had me feeling great on Days 1-3. But late on the night of Day 3 my chronic sinusitis made a sudden appearance, complete with postnasal drip and a convulsive phlegmy cough! (Ugh!). By the afternoon of Day 4 I was feeling a little achy and didn't know if it was from the coughing or an SE. Still don't. The minor body aches lasted 3 days and for the most part were managed with Aleve, but the sinusitis and cough have lingered. Went back for labs yesterday (Thurs, 7/20) and clearance for Taxol 2. Luckily, my blood counts were ok and I was able to have chemo. But I need to keep the sinusitis from turning into a sinus infection because if I have to go on antibiotics they will delay treatment. Day 2 of Taxol 2 I'm feeling good. Still have some post nasal drip but coughing has not been a problem so far. We'll see what happens as the pre meds wear off. Will the sinusitis and cough return with a vengeance? Will the flu-ish body aches come back? Are they SEs? Or related to my existing sinus problems? Or one of each? I feel like a lab rat!

I had eliminated it from my chemo basket because I had no bone pain during AC from the Neulasta shots. But I'll add it back into my arsenal of supplies if it helps you with the Taxol muscle aches. It could have the double benefit of helping to fight off a sinus infection. In my case, my nose doesn't drip. Instead, everything goes down the back of my throat and the constant drip forces me to cough uncontrollably - a horrible phlegmy barking cough - my curse of chronic non-allergic rhinitis. All it takes is a change in the weather to set it off and if not managed can turn into an infected sinus. My nasal sprays, allergy/asthma meds and sinus rinses aren't as effective as usual - maybe due to my suppressed immune system. But I really don't want any delays to treatment! Appreciate your advice! Lovepugs, Up to now my greatest concern re Taxol SEs was peripheral neuropathy, so prior to Taxol 1 I started taking 600mg of Alpha Lipoic Acid (available at health food and vitamin stores) and 500mg of B-12 daily. Some people take B-6 as well. These supplements, taken proactively, have been okayed by my medical oncologist and nurse practitioner, despite no studies that prove efficacy against neuropathy.

As someone who had her last chemo treatment 3 weeks ago, my only advice is to keep looking forward towards your next milestone and ultimate goal. For me, surgery comes next. But the best part of my treatment so far came soon after I completed chemotherapy. I had a 3-D mammogram and ultrasound of my left breast. Radiologists compared the scans to a 3-D mammogram and ultrasound taken in April prior to biopsies, which confirmed 2 cancerous lesions in my left breast (either 2 tumors - one relatively large and the other smaller; or, one large irregular shaped tumor, estimated at 4cm X 3cm when palpated). A biopsy also confirmed that an abnormal looking area in a lymph node was also positive for IDC. Well, none of the areas that looked suspicious for abnormal cell activity in April were apparent on the post-chemo mammogram and ultrasound. The lymph node and smaller section of the breast tumor appear clear. The larger section of the tumor shows something, but my surgeon thinks it could be thickened scar tissue or dead cancer cells. This doesn't mean I'm clear of cancer; only surgery and pathology will tell - but I'm thrilled with the results I got from chemo, and my surgeon is ecstatic! It also played a huge part in my decision to have a lumpectomy. I'm telling you this because I never imagined such a good outcome from chemo on what was, at the very least, Stage 2B IDC. Despite the SEs - which are gradually showing improvement - for me, chemotherapy has been worth the difficulties. I know it's hard to appreciate that now, but I hope it encourages you to power through and not let the SEs get you down. Best Wishes to you and all our BC sisters.",

      "Content": "May 19, 2017 02:05AM notanisland wrote: So glad to hear recent chemo starters are doing better and/or well! Had my first AC Chemo treatment today. Finished at 2:00 and as of right now (8:00pm) I'm feeling pretty darn good! For those of you who haven't started yet: I had been told that the entire appt today would take 2.5-3 hours. Not true. I was at the Oncology Clinic for 5 hours. First I had to give blood, then wait for the results, go through an assessment and meet with the nurse practitioner. Only after that could I sign in at the Treatment Room which was packed to capacity at 10:00. I waited about 30\" for a space and then got lucky - I had the best chemo tech I could ask for (named Jeremy) who carefully explained every step of my treatment. First he hooked my port up to an IV. I received a combo steroid (dexamethadone) and anti-nausea med (Aloxi), then Pepcid for stomach upset, then another anti-nausea/anti-vomiting med (Emend) - along with saline solution to keep me hydrated. I was also drinking gobs of water and sucking on dry mouth lozenges and hard candy and rinsing with water/salt/baking soda mix (to hopefully prevent mouth sores). Then I got the A chemo (Adriamycin) which is red. Jeremy told me something that I hadn't known - the red will show in my urine so don't panic! And I told him something he hadn't heard that I learned from the BCO community: chemo patients refer to it as The Red Devil. He got a chuckle out of that! After the Adriamycin I got the C chemo (Cytoxan). All together, I spent 3.5 hrs in the treatment room. It didn't seem that long and I didn't feel anything. The port worked perfectly. The lidocaine worked perfectly. Finished a book I brought with me. Nothing deep, a \"fluff\" type mystery. The anti-nausea pre-treatment meds that were given to me are supposed to be long-lasting. According to Jeremy, one lasts about 2 days and the other, a week. Of course, for some of us this isn't enough to ensure no nausea. So at the first sign I'm to take an anti-nausea pill that was prescribed for me (Compazine) and continue taking it for 7 days. If I still need more or have insomnia I'm to supplement the Compazine with Lorazepam, which I've also been prescribed. 5-10mg of Compazine to be taken every 6-8 hours with .5-1 mg Lorazepam staggered 3-4 hours after each Compazine dose. The side effect that I am dreading most is all-over bone pain. The day after treatment (tomorrow) I will go back for a Neulasta shot, which stimulates bone marrow to produce white blood cells. Unfortunately, this hurts! I guess it's kind of like growing pains that kids go through during growth spurts, but this hurts everywhere - back, hips, legs, arms, ribs, the entire skeleton. To lessen the side effect, I've been told to take a Claritin (or another 24-hour antihistamine) 30\" before I get the Neulasta shot and to continue taking it for as long as I have bone pain (7-10 days). Tylenol and Advil can supplement the antihistamine. Don't ask me why antihistamines work. I talked with a teacher sitting next to me who is on the same chemo regimen as me but 2 months ahead. She said she did everything that was suggested and she still had bad bone pain. She literally spent 3-4 days following treatment in bed with heating pads. Said it felt like the worst flu she ever had! She recommended acupuncture. I guess the bone pain goes hand in hand with the other side effect that seems to affect everyone - fatigue. I hope that if I have both SEs they happen at the same time! Anyway, that's my story for Day #1. Other side effects I have to watch for: Chills, Fever, Constipation, Diarrhea and more - but so far, so good. Oh, and Jeremy warned me about one side effect of the steroid that was given to me prior to treatment today - ENERGY! Like others have reported here, he said that I may not be able to sleep tonight! So I'm charging my iPad up and preparing to binge watch all the shows that I've missed! Thank you for your prayers and good thoughts and wishes. I honestly believe I could feel them lifting me up today! ❤💕 And I send them back to all of you. I don't know what tomorrow will bring, but I'm as prepared as I can be. And for now I am grateful for a first day of chemo that could not have gone better. P.S. Parakeets Rule: I have a 2inch incision at the base of my neck right side, but my port is placed well below my collarbone, more in line with my right armpit.",

She was also going to cut my chin-length hair much shorter, but in 10 days that may not be necessary! When I feel the need to, I'll start wearing scarves out. But because I'm playing it safe while I see if the Neulasta shot I'm receiving today works faster on stimulating neutrophil production, I don't expect that I'll be attending client meetings in the next couple of weeks. My main clients have been very understanding and so far have had no problem with communicating with me by email. I'm very fortunate. No deadlines missed, most beaten. Glad the Neulasta worked so well for you! If I hadn't had my labs done on Day 9, I would never have known that my neutrophil count was .03 (total WBC 1.6) at nadir. I had planned to attend a luncheon that day, and instead got sent home from the onc lab with a face mask and antibiotic soap! Off to get my Neulasta shot now. Wish I could do something to improve my body's sensitivity and reaction to these drugs - but even the pre-chemo steroid doesn't affect me much - no rosy cheeks! ",

Thumbs up to lovepugs, who also wrapped up AC today, and to those of you who are celebrating milestones - which is all of you! I go back tomorrow for my Neulasta shot and next Thursday for lab work to monitor my neutropenia. Pretty sure my WBC will be very low again from Day 5-10, but I didn't mind as much since I was hoping this would be the last time I'd have this problem. But in talking with my chemo nurse today about Taxol, some people do continue to have neutropenia and are given a shot to help boost WBC. The shot is not Neulasta, and not as strong. I'll have to wait and see if I'm one of those people (Oh please! I hope not! 12 weeks of isolation would drive me crazy!) My first day of Taxol will be July 13. I'm scheduled for early morning because the first treatment can take up to 6 hours. After blood testing and seeing the doctor, I'll go to the treatment room, where I'll be given pre-meds just as with AC. The chemo nurse told me that for the first treatment they like to wait an hour between premeds and Taxol. And the Taxol is administered very slowly so they can monitor vitals and watch for reactions. Something strange. I asked my chemo nurse about DD Taxol which I've read about on BCO.org. I've read about having DD Taxol every other week, and even every three weeks. Here's the strange part - she had never heard of DD Taxol! (Should I be alarmed that my clinic is not up-to-date?) So RadMonkey, I can't answer your question but there are others on BCO.org who can!

Since my 4th and final AC chemo treatment on 6/29 the SEs seem to have suddenly shown up. Must be cumulative in my case. The skin of my hands both front and back have turned a gray hue. I've totally lost my sense of salty and savory flavors, making it impossible to enjoy food (everything tastes like cardboard) and difficult to cook. Sweet and spicy are over-accentuated so just as unsatisfying. Because my WBC goes so low at nadir I have had to forego raw fruits and vegetables from Day 4-10, which brought on constipation. The Senna-S prescription I was given eventually works, but I should have been more proactive in taking it. Despite my use of Biotene rinse and water/salt/baking soda mixture, I did get one mouth sore that was quite painful. Thankfully, it quickly cleared up with use of a magical ointment from Japan (Sato Oral Ointment). Still, I haven't yet suffered through nausea, muscle or bone pain or extreme fatigue, so I'm going to focus on building my immunity (staying away from crowds, getting enough rest, forcing myself to eat well, and visualizing hard working bone marrow) so I can move forward with Taxol on Thursday. I hope my SEs are manageable and that I \"settle in\" as you all seem to be doing. It's going to be a long 12 weeks, so I'll be sure to keep reading about your progress for motivation and strength.

By physical exam she estimates that the 4 cm tumor (left) is now between 1 and 2 cm (difficult to tell because of its irregular shape) and that there is less swelling/inflammation under my left arm. My surgery will take place 3-4 weeks following chemotherapy (whenever that may be), and while my surgeon would prefer that I have the maximum benefits of 4 DD AC & 12 Taxol treatments, I think any reduction in the cancer will be considered a positive. I understand your disappointment, MsRobin. I wasn't expecting to be so affected by Taxol either. The delays mean we are in a cruel kind of limbo - not knowing when we will be done with chemo and able to move on to the next step in our treatments and recovery. But we mustn't let ourselves be discouraged. The aches and fatigue are hard, the delays are frustrating, but they too shall pass. We will get through this!",

When I began Taxol I still had quite a few long wisps of brown hair, the color that I dyed my original hair. (I'm not kidding when I say my wispy comb-over was reminiscent of a baby chimpanzee or Linus, Lucy's bro!) I also managed to keep all the rest of my body hair, eyelashes and eyebrows. That is, until Taxol treatment #9 was delayed a week. Soon after, I lost my bottom eyelashes. Then my top eyelashes, eyebrows and remaining head hair became very sparse. Thursday is my last chemo treatment - Taxol #12 - and something tells me I will soon lose whatever is left! Oh well. Might as well start from scratch! I'm sure my hair will come in grey and I'm going to be leaving it. My hairdresser is already collecting photos of interesting highlights and rinses for grey hair. When I was first diagnosed in mid-April, waiting for the outcome of biopsies and scans and then dealing with the results had me in an almost constant state of anxiety. Waiting weeks to meet with a surgeon and then a medical oncologist, and not having a plan of action for 35 days, felt paralyzing. My lifesaver was and is my primary care physician who would call me weekly to see how I was doing and now encourages me to call her whenever I need to talk. I hope you each have someone like her in your life. She suggested that I take buspirone HCL to \"take the edge off,\" and I can't say enough about what a difference it has made in my attitude and outlook. I have always been a confident, take-charge sort of person; being good at my work is important to me, as is taking care of my home, family and friends. I can't say exactly how long it took, but one day - maybe a month after starting buspirone - I realized that the feelings of dread and anxiety were gone and I was able to get a good night's sleep, put in a full day's work, enjoy time with family, go out with friends and laugh, return to my artwork. I felt strong and positive again. Maybe this would have happened eventually without the medication, but why suffer? There will always be something new and frightening to face - surgery, pathology, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, the future - and if a 5 mg tablet can help me to live every day to the fullest, then I'm all for it. I admit, I didn't start the buspirone as soon as I was given the prescription. The list of potential side effects seemed prohibitive! But in the weeks before port placement I decided to try it. It's important to take buspirone at the same time each day, and because it can cause drowsiness I asked my PCP if it was necessary to take 2 5mg tablets daily as prescribed. She advised me to start with 1 5mg tablet at bedtime and this is the dosage I've been on for the past 5 months. It's quite sufficient for me. Some people even cut the tiny 5mg tab in half. If you feel depressed or \"not yourself,\" unable to function or think clearly, I suggest that you speak with your physician. Wishing you all the very best. ",

As you note, most May chemos are scheduled to wrap up soon. I know you've had delays, and I had a one week delay on Taxol. My last neo-adjuvant chemo treatment was yesterday. Did you complete your chemo regimen? If you've managed to get through chemo, you've already come so far. Am I understanding correctly? Did you have a first bout of cancer over 21 years ago that was treated and in remission; then today, 11 years later, have a recurrence or new cancer? Have you discussed your change of heart (from mastectomy to foregoing surgery) with your medical oncologist and surgeon? You're only 57. Please discuss this with your medical team and family before you come to any firm decision. Ask all your questions and think the options over carefully. Like Moodyblues, I care and want you to make the best informed choice for YOU. I wish you the best.",

May your break from Taxol significantly scale back your SEs so you can get through the rest of your treatments. One additional week off after #8 worked wonders for me. Like you, I knew (or maybe my body knew) that postponing treatment was the right thing to do. And when I did have #9 I was pleasantly surprised to find that my SEs were reduced and never rose to their highest point again. A little more than 3 weeks since my final chemo infusion, the neuropathy in fingers and feet is a little less every day. It's a slow process but I'm confident it will go away. I find that my legs are not as strong as before (the aches in my legs were what alarmed my MO most and resulted in the 1-week chemo break) - they feel weak and wobbly, but I think with more weight bearing and strengthening exercises this should improve. My nails are blackened and tender and I've lost part of one, but the soreness is not as bad as before and the nails will grow out, as DodgersGirl notes. My hair is starting to grow back in, not very nicely or evenly, and mostly a bright white that looks quite shocking since I've been a dark brunette all my life (time to consider giving up the hair-dye!). I'll continue to wear my wig when I go to meetings and events, until it grows out to the point where I can do something with it. A scarf and straw hat is sufficient for errands and casual outings. I feel a little stubble on one brow and one eyelid - no sign of eyebrows or lashes on the opposite side! Things are getting better. I hope for you too.",

I was supposed to start yesterday and received a call just hours before my appointment, telling me that my radiation oncologist had not yet received clearance from my health insurer! So my first treatment has been postponed 3 week days (and a weekend). I'll start next Monday - IF approval is received by then. Your description of hair growth makes me smile - being very much like my own experience. In the past 2 months I've grown about 1\" of hair on my head, stubby eyelashes, and brows that seem to have grown in overnight - all over and in every direction! The neuropathy in my fingers and feet continues to improve, albeit slowly. I figure it took 3 months of Taxol to get to the worst point, it'll take at least 3 months to disappear. So I'm expecting it to resolve itself in another month. It may be my imagination, but I think the alpha lipoic acid (600 mg daily) is working. I'm trying hard to keep up with exercise and lose some additional weight, but during the holidays it's a battle to just keep it off! My husband is trying his best to encourage me to eat foods high in anti-oxidants and good for preventing inflammation - but why is it that those foods are the ones that are least appealing to me?!? (because fat and sugar taste good, that's why!) You know what my New Year resolution will be! Happy Holidays to All!",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2018 05:59PM notanisland wrote: Hi Beauz, MsRobin and anyone still reading this thread! I finished my 33 radiation therapy treatments yesterday! Yay! I had some darkening of the skin (like a tan) in the treated area, but nothing to complain about. And in the final 3 days there was redness at the base of my neck and up the left side of my neck. No pain. But then it got itchy! My radiation oncologist gave me a prescription for Fluocinonide Cream that worked like a charm, but as it turned out, the irritation had already reached its peak and today the itch is gone. Interestingly, my last 8 treatments were boosters - treating the surgical area of the breast only, so by the time the redness showed up on my neck, I hadn't received radiation to that area for about 5 days. So there's still a possibility that I could develop skin irritation at the surgical site in the next few days. Side effects don't necessarily show up right away. They accumulate, a little like chemo. I still have occasional breast pain near the surgical site and radiating from the area. Like your doctor, my doctors say that it's normal. Since the tumor that was removed during the lumpectomy was so large, it's possible that there was some nerve damage. But more likely, the nerves are healing, causing the occasional jabbing pain and burning sensation - both of which are getting less frequent. After chemo (but before surgery and radiation) I even started having some pain in my left elbow that sometimes went up the underside of my upper arm. All three of the doctors I mentioned this to (my internist, RO and MO - who said it was probably a side effect of chemo) said it was likely nerve pain. It happens less and less frequently now, so they're probably right. The Taxol-caused neuropathy in my feet and hands persists but continues to improve at a snail's pace. The stiffness in my knees that started a week after chemo ended is also still with me - my MO believes it's also a side effect of Taxol. My range of motion has been 100% throughout. I credit the arm and back exercises that my chemo buddies advised me to start while I was on chemo, preparing for surgery and following surgery. The only drawback to this is that I sometimes overdo and should be more careful about how much I lift and do that could possibly trigger lymphedema. Don't want that! I've been on Letrozole for over 2 months and so far, so good. I am grateful not to have the unbearable side effects that have caused some women to reject hormone therapy, but I am gradually gaining weight - a half pound at a time! At end March I'll be seeing my MO for a 3-month visit. Afterwards, I'll meet with the clinical trial nurse from our University Cancer Center to take labs, measurements and vitals that will be submitted to a the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology for participation in a study called BWEL - Breast Cancer Weight Loss Study. This is a randomized long-term trial that will evaluate the role of weight loss in adjuvant treatment of overweight women with early stage breast cancer. (Not that I consider my Stage 3A or 3B cancer \"early stage.\") As a supporting physician of clinical trials, my MO will monitor me for the study every 6 months for 3 years, then once a year for the following 7 years. It is known that being overweight can contribute to the onset of breast cancer; this study will track whether weight loss can help to prevent recurrence. In mid-April I'll have a 3-D mammogram and a baseline MRI, which my surgeon will review with me a week later. Hopefully at that visit she will also schedule removal of the port used for chemo (and sometimes now used for blood draws). Until then, I continue to go into the chemo clinic for a port flush every 4 weeks. I see my RO for a 4-month followup in early June. Sorry for this lengthy post. it's been a while since I logged on, so I had lots to tell you! And it's so good to hear that you're doing fine! I'll keep checking for your messages and posting whenever I have more to update. Stay Happy & Positive, and Be Well!",

Like your experience with Xeloda, I'm finding Letrozole to be manageable - my knees are very stiff in the morning and when I get up after sitting for a while. I am also gaining weight, which in my case is NOT a good thing. I've got to be more disciplined and watch what I eat, limit my food portions and exercise more! I no longer have the excuse of certain foods being unappealing, since I've recovered my sense of taste. I still have chemo-induced neuropathy in my feet and fingers, though it's tolerable. I got a \"thumbs up\" from my MO at my 3-month visit, but I'm sure my surgeon will notice the pounds returning. I'll see her after my 3-D mammogram and MRI on April 19. Won't see my RO until early June. I had a total of 33 radiation therapy treatments - 25 to the whole left breast including mid-line of my chest (to catch the mammary lymph), left axillary area, and left super clavicle with 8 boosters to the whole left breast. I received treatment while positioned on my back with arms raised overhead and my head turned slightly to the right. My MO decided on Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) because my BC was on the left and radiation could more likely affect my heart. Possible affects on my lungs, thyroid, esophagus didn't come up. IMRT is a technique to deliver whole breast irradiation in patients receiving treatment for left-sided BC after breast-conserving surgery when certain conditions are met: 1) Significant cardiac radiations exposure is expected to be greater than or equal to 25Gy to 10cm3 or more of the heart with 3D conformal RT despite the use of complex positioning device; and 2) With the use of IMRT, there is a reduction in the absolute heart volume receiving 25Gy or higher by at least 20%. (I only understand what that means at a very elementary level! But basically, because your BC is on the right, I wouldn't worry). Keep moisturizing the irradiated skin (3-4 times a day). Aloe vera gel was very effective for me. I also used a petroleum based healing ointment (Cerave) at night but others I know used less greasy moisturizers like Lubriderm and they worked fine. If it itches, ask for a prescription anti-itch cream. It was only during the final 4 treatments that my neck became \"burnt\" (brown rather than red) and I wasn't even receiving radiation to the neck by that time - effects can show up delayed. But 18 days later I was able to attend a wedding with my neck exposed and the discoloration not very noticeable. Is your doctor taking you off Xeloda because you're going to start rad therapy? I know it's usual to start hormone therapy AFTER radiation, but because of the amount of residual cancer I had post-chemo, my MO wanted to get me on Letrozole right away and my RO agreed. I've been on Letrozole for 4 months now, and didn't stop while I was having radiation therapy. Will you go back on Xeloda afterwards? I wish you well! I know it seems like a lot of treatments, but it goes by quickly. And if you can keep the skin irritation under control, it's a breeze.  ",

The last time I posted was just before I had my first annual mammogram since my diagnosis in April 2017 and you won't believe this, but they found something in my right breast (my BC was in the left)! My radiologist tried to assure me that it would be very unusual for a cancer to show up so soon after I had completed 5 months of chemo (in October 2017) but I insisted on a biopsy this time. (Something I failed to do the first time I felt a lump in my left breast that didn't show up on the mammogram or ultrasound...and ended up with a Stage 3A IDC.) I was lucky this time and it was a fibroadenoma. My docs will monitor it every 6 months, so I'm scheduled for a followup ultrasound in early November. If it gets larger, out it goes!

You may start worrying about whether port placement the day before infusion is too close. Mine was on Monday and 1st AC chemo on Thursday. I had placed a dollop of EMLA (Lidocaine) cream on the port site an hour before infusion as instructed, but was unaware that there was a piece of impenetrable plastic covering the stitches! My onc nurse solved that by giving me a shot of Lidocaine prior to infusion (actually it was more like the prick of a TB test, at the port site) and I experienced no discomfort at all. I understand your worry over hair loss, though initially I didn't think it was going to be much of a concern for me. You will receive good advice from others to \"rock your baldness, scarves, hats, or whatever you choose.\" How fortunate that some have the courage and confidence to rock their baldness, but in all honesty, I do not. For the most part, I work at home and plan to wear scarves because I'll be undergoing chemo in the hot months through end-September. But when I meet with clients in their offices and at business lunches, I do intend to wear a wig. Comfort be damned! All I can tell you is to prepare - shop for your scarves, caps, hats, wig or whatever you choose to try. Schedule a time to have your hair cut short or buzzed, if that's what you decide. Don't wait til after treatment starts to begin preparations for side effects. Spend this next week getting ready and the time will be well spent. You won't have time to worry! Keep us advised of how you're doing - I wish you the best!",

Breastlessbeth, Because I've had NO bad side effects from AC Chemo #1 - and I mean 0 with the exception of the bottom of the barrel WBC, I asked my MO and NP if the chemo is really working. They assured me that there is no correlation between the efficacy of chemo drugs and SEs. They know my chemo is working because my WBC is so low - so now to get the Neulasta working! MsRobin, My husband is also out working in the germy world every day and could pick up a virus or bacteria and pass it on to me without even showing symptoms. In my current condition, with only .03 total WBC, I wash my hands with antibacterial soap OFTEN, don't touch my face, and wear a mask. My husband totally understands, yours will too. And FYI, in addition to Compazine for nausea I was given Lorazepam to supplement at nights if I was still nauseous or had trouble sleeping. I haven't needed to take either of them so far, but things can change - just as you may not feel nauseous after #3. Hope that's the case! Good luck on your blood test! MsLin, Your Oncology Center sounds wonderful. It's what I had pictured in my mind before I saw the infusion room at my onc center. Small narrow room, recliners lined up against both walls, barely any space between each chair, no privacy, no room for icing feet and hands, in fact, no ice! There's no way that anyone could even consider using cold caps, because there's no spare room for a companion or a cooler. I thought about asking to have my treatments at the hospital next door, which has an infusion center much like yours, but this is my MO's clinic and I will get more attention from him if I am on site.",

I was waiting to see if my very low WB neutrophil count would repeat itself 1 week out, and it did. Yesterday my labs showed neutrophils (the part of WBC that fights infection) at .5, which is better than after AC#1 but still extremely low immunity. Blood test results do show neutrophil activity, so they are on the upswing and I should be fine by my next infusion on 6/15. This was very helpful to me in determining my \"safe\" days vs. \"at risk\" days since low WBC isn't reflected in how we feel. I feel great, like I can do anything and go anywhere, but my labs tell me that's not the case. For the remaining two AC treatments I now know that I can carry on as usual from approximately Day1-Day4 and Day12-Day14 (I'm on AC every other week). From Day5-Day11 I need to take extra precautions - wearing a mask when I go out, washing hands frequently with antibacterial soap, using wipes and staying away from large crowds. Luckily, most of my work is done from home and I can schedule client meetings on my \"safe\" days or by teleconference. I also know that I am one of those people that truly needs Neulasta, so I'm very fortunate that I have experienced no bone pain from the shot. You can imagine my shock when I received a letter from my drug insurer, telling me that my Neulasta would not be covered! Fortunately for their customer service department (because I was ready to pick up the phone and start chewing someone out!), my phone rang within minutes of opening the letter and it was a representative of my drug insurance provider, telling me to please disregard the letter, which had been sent in error! Whew! Outside of the WBC issue, I have had some minor side effects since AC#2. As expected, my hair started falling out on Day14 and now (on Day23) I have the mangy dog look others have described so well. On Monday I see my hairstylist (who is about to become my wigstylist) for a private session to cut what's left on my head down to a couple of inches and to trim and thin my wig. For the last few days I've been wearing bandanas, but I would NOT say I'm \"rocking the look.\" A few days after AC#2 I lost a good deal of my sense of taste. I can still taste sweet and tangy, but savory foods taste blah. No amount of seasoning seems to help and I'm just going to have to get used to it. My NP tells me that it will take a long time for \"taste\" to return and that when it does it may not be the same as it was before. So I'm kind of in mourning for the enjoyment that cooking and eating used to bring me! On the other hand, my surgeon had told me (before she whisked me off to the MO for neo adjuvant chemo) that with my highly positive ER+ (100%) and PR+ (70%) I would have to watch for weight gain. (It seems that hormones - and therefore, my cancer - thrives in fat.) Now that everything I enjoy eating tastes like cardboard, gaining weight may not be a problem. So, forward we go! I'm now going to catch up on all that's been going on with you ladies by reading everything since my last post. Thank you for sharing your experiences on this journey none of us wanted to take. But I'm sure glad we're here for each other. Have a good weekend!",

So my question is for those of you on this thread who have already had surgery - a lumpectomy with node removal (my biopsy was positive for at least one node): what was your recovery period like- from the day of surgery on? What were limitations ofpain, movement, wound care? Did you need assistance at home? Were you able to care for young children and pets? I'm trying to plan ahead but it's very difficult when each of my doctors treats me separately. I haven't been referred to a Radiation Oncologist yet and guess that won't happen until after surgery! It's been very much one step at a time, one doctor at a time, and frustrating for a \"planner\" like me! Thanks for any insight and personal experiences you can provide.

Very strange since my legs never ached this much during chemo. Hopefully, it's just due to lack of regular exercise, so I'm trying to build up strength before surgery. But so far, no relief, and with surgery less than 2 weeks away I can't take any blood thinning pain meds (and I probably wouldn't want to).

      "Content": "Dec 6, 2017 11:50PM notanisland wrote: Hi Beauz, I know what it felt like to hear that pathology report. Thank you for letting me know that I'm not alone, but please know that I wish you weren't having to keep me company. At the time I didn't ask for a copy of the report because I didn't want to see the disappointing results in cold, technical terms, but I will get a copy the next time I see my medical oncologist. After talking with my docs, I'm at peace with my decision. Here's what I did: After receiving my pathology results from my surgeon on 11/20 (5 days after my lumpectomy and SLND) and hearing from her my general options (further surgery or proceed with radiation therapy & hormone therapy), I decided to consult my medical oncologist and radiation oncologist. She told me there was no rush to make a decision (though I don't think the oncologists felt the same way) and if I chose not to have further surgery, I would see her next after radiation therapy. My medical oncologist said no more chemo for me and was very definitely in favor of proceeding with radiation therapy and hormone therapy. In fact, he wanted to start me on hormone therapy right away, given the amount of residual cancer that had been left after chemo (5.2cm removed during surgery). He said that the SLND that had been performed and the resulting 2/4 positive sentinel lymph nodes did not indicate a need for further surgery (an ALND and removal of axillary lymph nodes in Levels I & II), because lymph node removal is not therapeutic. Instead, it provides guidance for whether targeted radiation and systemic hormonal therapies are needed. As for having a mastectomy, he said that was up to me and whether I felt I needed it for peace of mind, but that survival rates were no different. The best thing my MO said to me was, \"Stage III breast cancer is curable.\" I asked, \"When will you consider me cured?\" And he said, very matter-of-factly, \"Ten years.\" The pathology results had taken me from a guesstimate of Stage IIB to a Stage IIIA or B. The thing with neo-adjuvant chemo is that you never really know. But my MO did send me for new CT and Whole Body Bone scans, which came back clear. I met my radiation oncologist for the first time and he explained in even more detail, why he thought I should forego more surgery and proceed with radiation therapy. I believe he said that about 50% have residual cancer after surgery and that treating it with radiation therapy is as effective as additional surgery. Having a mastectomy does not preclude recurrence. He also said that removing more axillary lymph nodes is no guarantee as cancer cells also move through the bloodstream and we have mammary lymph nodes deep in the middle of the chest and lymph nodes above the clavicle in the neck area. Best option is to target those areas with radiation therapy, which I have to have whether I have a mastectomy or not. He also said that while he normally likes to wait til after radiation therapy to start hormone therapy, he understands why my medical oncologist is eager to get me on a systemic treatment asap. I've talked with him about my concerns for followup monitoring because my cancer was so difficult to find on 3-D mammograms and ultrasound scans, yet my requests for an MRI were met with resistance. My RO said that we can do an MRI after radiation treatment is complete as a baseline, and follow it up for a couple of years with annual MRIs. I felt as though someone was finally hearing me. Ultimately, I did not go with \"Standard of Care,\" which would have been a mastectomy and ALND (followed by radiation therapy and hormone therapy). I started Femara on Dec 2. That's only 5 doses but no side effects so far. Hopefully, side effects won't accumulate because I'm on this aromatase inhibitor for 5-10 years. I've had my radiation simulation and start therapy on Dec 13, targeting the whole breast, axillary (underarm) lymph, mammary (mid-chest) lymph, and neck. I'll have 33 treatments, finishing on Jan 30. Coming to this decision was made easier for me with the experience and guidance of my oncologists. (My surgeon and primary care physician talked options but gave no advice.) Now I feel I can move forward. Talk to everyone and gather information based on their research, experience and best outcomes. Weigh the pros and cons and make the decision that is best for you. I'll be waiting to hear from you!",

I lost more strands as I ran my hands through my hair. I wasn't expecting it quite so soon (14 days into AC chemo) or so suddenly, but today was also tentatively Day 1 of AC Chemo 2 and I had bigger things to worry about - namely, would my WB neutrophil count be high enough to go ahead with infusion? Well I'm happy and grateful to report that the Neulasta finally kicked in and my neutrophil count (the part of the total WBC that fights infection) went from .03 to 6.1 in 5 days. A neutrophil count of 1.0 is required for chemo infusion, so Neulasta did it's job (albeit a little slowly. My NP says I may have \"naive\" bone marrow.) It was 2.9 before my very first infusion on 5/18, so Neulasta has really given even my normal count a boost. It's possible that when I go in for a blood test in a week, my count will be very, very low again, but I'm willing to isolate myself for the rest of June if I must! Luckily, I work at home for the most part. Greedy thing that I am, I'm hoping that Chemo 2 is a repeat of Chemo 1 in terms of other SEs. Fingers crossed for none. Wishing the same blessings for each of you. Hugs : ) P.S. MsRobin, Sounds like the change in your chemo treatments (from every 2 to every 3 wks) may solve multiple issues and provide time and justification for much needed SE meds. I too would gladly give you my Compazine and Lorazepam, which so far have gone to waste. So frustrating! I hope your insurer comes to the right decision - quickly. No one should have to suffer from debilitating nausea. Stay strong. We're with you! ",

But I admit that the week off made a positive difference. The neuropathy remained constant but not as severe. I regained a sense of taste for savory foods (I was so sick of only tasting sweet), and enjoyed a weekend without muscle aches and fatigue. When I returned to the oncology clinic on 9/14, I found out that even my RBC had gone up. It hadn't been of great concern, but was an added bonus. I was cleared for Taxol 9 on the 14th and now on Day 5 I'm pleased to have had less side effects than I did following treatments 7 and 8. Neuropathy in my fingers increased on Days 3&4 but was much more tolerable because the body aches and fatigue didn't return, and the numbness in my fingers and feet has decreased today. My sense of taste is still good. Based on the way I've been feeling, I'm confident that I'll be cleared for Taxol 10 on Thursday. I hope that I can squeeze through the last 3 treatments without accumulating side effects again. If that happens, they may decide not to complete all 12 Taxol cycles, and I will go on to surgery. I received chemotherapy before surgery in order to shrink the cancer in my breast and lymph, so whether I have 1, 2 or 3 more treatments, it's time to schedule a visit with my surgeon. I will be thinking of you on Wednesday and Thursday and hoping your platelet counts are up and okay for treatment. Best wishes. ",

If my calculations are right, you finished AC at the end of August and recently started Taxol. My experience with Dose Dense AC (4 treatments, 1 every 2 weeks, over a total of 8 weeks) was that I had about 6 days of very low white blood count every 2 weeks despite the Neulasta shot. I was fortunate in that the low WBC did not make me feel bad, but I did have to stay away from crowds in a kind of self-imposed confinement from Day 5-10. By the time I'd go back for my next treatment, my WBC would be good enough for clearance. It really wasn't bad and I was hopeful that the subsequent 12 weeks of Taxol would be just as easy to get through. In fact, my Nurse Practitioner told me that for many people Taxol has less side effects than AC. Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case for me. Neuropathy (numbness) in my fingers and feet, muscle aches and fatigue started slowly and then accumulated, affecting me for longer periods of time and increasing in intensity. With only 7 days between each treatment, that didn't leave too many good days, and so the one week delay of Taxol 9 was needed. And it has helped to \"dial back\" the side effects. But you should know that my experience isn't necessarily yours. We all respond differently. Taxol affects MsRobin's and moodyblues' platelet counts, frustrating them by delaying their treatments. You may not have an issue with your blood counts either. There are many people who find Taxol more tolerable than DD AC. I hope you are one of them. Wishing you the Best! ",

Try not to worry too much about the impact that delays have on the effectiveness of your treatments. A chemo-buddy of mine completed neo-adjuvant chemo about 4 weeks ago (DD AC followed by Taxol). She had a terrible time with UTIs and low blood counts during her treatment, and like you, had a couple of hospital stays that delayed her treatment by a month total. Well, on Monday she had a lumpectomy and I received a text from her less than 24 hours later with the best possible news. She had been diagnosed through ultrasound with a 2.5 cm breast tumor and a swollen lymph. She had a biopsy done, but I don't believe the lymph was biopsied at that time. But in the ultrasound after chemo and prior to surgery the 2.5 cm tumor had shrunk to microscopic particles so the surgeon removed the tissue around the biopsy markers. The lymph was negative in the most recent ultrasound and because the sentinel nodes tested negative, they removed only two instead of the planned 3. She will know more after the pathology report on the removed tissue, but her prognosis looks very good!",

I vacillate from one day to the next. After getting the results of pathology from my surgeon on Monday I was leaning towards more surgery - ALND and a mastectomy. By the time I spoke to my PCP on Wednesday I was considering a BMX to be safe. Thursday I refused to think about BC and enjoyed Thanksgiving with my family. Yesterday I saw my medical oncologist and he advised that the ALND shouldn't be considered therapeutic - instead, the 2/4 positive result of the SLND is enough to guide radiation therapy (location and number of treatments). Despite the size of the tumor that was removed by lumpectomy, he doesn't feel a mastectomy is necessary because of the clean margins - though it's totally up to me. He'd like to start me on Femara right away if it's ok with the radiation oncologist. Tomorrow I see an RO for the first time and will go over my questions and concerns again.

I told my PCP that I am sometimes paralyzed with fear and haven't had a full, good night's sleep since she called with my biopsy results on 4/12. She prescribed buspirone (5 mg, 2X a day), which has to be taken continuously. Now I'm sitting here reading the \"How to Use\" and \"Side Effects,\" and really weighing the benefit to risk. \"When this medication is started symptoms of anxiety may sometimes get worse before they improve. Dizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea, nervousness, lightheadedness, restlessness, blurred vision, tiredness, and trouble sleeping may occur. Rarely, patients may develop movement disorders...in some cases, these conditions may be permanent.\" Yikes! Plus, it requires taking at the same times every day, under the same conditions (you decide with or w/o food but have to stick with that decision), takes a month or more to feel the full effects and reacts with a number of OTC meds. One of our community members (on a different thread) told me that she has been on buspirone for 15 years and the only SE she has had is fatigue which went away once she got used to the medication. Still, I just don't know if I should risk it. I hope others with experience see this post and comment. I met my MO for the first time yesterday - I will be receiving neo adjuvant chemo over a span of 20 weeks (then follow with surgery, radiation therapy and hormone therapy). First, Adriamycin® (Doxorubicin) and Cytoxan® (Cyclophosamide) for 4 treatments, one every other week for a total 8 weeks. Followed by Taxol® (Paclitaxel), 12 treatments, one a week for 12 weeks. He explained that there is really no difference in recurrence rates between chemo before or after surgery, but that neo adjuvant chemo is done to benefit surgery. In my case, my surgeon would like to see the tumor shrink and give me the option for a lumpectomy and hopefully fewer lymph removed. No definite start date for chemo yet, but my single lumen port placement has been scheduled for 5/10. Problem is, I've been reading all the posts about port placement and it sounds like there's quite a bit of pain and stiffness for a day or two after. I have a big family celebration that I'd like to show up for on 5/12. Few people (my immediate family, employer and 3 close friends) know I was diagnosed with BC 4/12, and I'd like to keep it that way a while longer. I wonder if my MO would be open to letting me use an IV for my first chemo treatment, then having the port put in before the 2nd? I guess that's a question for 5/5 when I go back to the oncology clinic to meet with the Nurse Practitioner for chemo counseling. Maybe I can also ask if the MO can prescribe another type of anxiety medication - one that I can take just when I really need it, and not continually. I take enough meds as it is, and soon I'll be filled to the brim. Doesn't it seem strange to be relying on toxins to make us better? But that's science, and as my MO said to me yesterday, \"Cancer is Biology.\" No wonder that was never my favorite subject.  ",

I have had acupuncture in the past for sinusitis, sciatica, overall health, and depending upon the severity of my SEs (I start AC on 5/18) I may look into acupuncture and reiki and try to schedule sessions around treatment days. I can imagine that if your lymph node involvement was unexpected, the post-surgery recommendation of chemotherapy must have come as a shock. I'm glad you've decided to use all the resources available to beat BC and do all you can to avoid recurrence. That's the spirit! As for fasting during chemo, I also read the posts between Amapola36 and SerenitySTAT on Topic: Anyone Fasting During Chemo (4 hours before, 24 hours after)? which peaked my interest too. I did an online search for studies, most of which were done on animals by a team led by Valter Longo, professor of gerontology & biological sciences at USC. It seems that fasting may reduce SEs and increase the efficacy of chemotherapy. I've only scanned the reports, so haven't developed a personal opinion, but one thing I would definitely do before considering fasting before and during chemo, is to discuss it with my MO. Thanks to you and MamaEnki for the recommendation of \"The Cancer Fighting Kitchen.\" Right after I log off BCO I'm going to see if it's available as an e-book. I wish you the best!",

In addition - my NP told me is that around nadir (Day 7 or so) I should eat only cooked produce. Fresh fruits and vegetables carry bacteria that's difficult to clean off completely. Even insect bites to the skin and bruises can transfer bacteria that can make us sick at our lowest WBC. So this week I'll skip the salads and fresh fruits and go cooked.  ",

But if you take each of your symptoms separately, they are each very common to cancer patients with low immunity. As soon as my PCP learned of my BC DX she checked my vaccination chart and scheduled Shingles and Pneumonia vaccinations. Both take 2-3 weeks to be effective, so it was important to bring my vaccinations up-to-date asap. Anxiety, disease and/or treatment that weaken our immune system increase the chance of a shingles outbreak. I was also instructed to see my dentist prior to chemo and to have an oral care plan in place before treatment began. This doesn't ensure that problems won't crop up, such as oral mucositis (an inflammation of the mucous membranes in the mouth) or teeth-grinding (which you already suspect) that cause pain in the teeth or jaw muscles. These too are side effects of diagnosis and treatment (anxiety, low immunity). Within 24 hours of having a Total Body Bone Scan and CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvic (both with contrast) I came down with a monster triple-bacteria UTI that had to be taken care of before chemo could start. I did not have a fever. Five days of sulfa drugs took care of it, but I have since been extremely careful, knowing now that my low immunity after AC #1 makes me even more susceptible. I don't know if it helps, but in addition to the 3 liters of water I drink daily, I also drink cranberry juice. And as soon as I feel the urge to go to the bathroom, I'm there! None of this helps you right now, but I guess what I want to say is, try not to stress. The UTI treatment may delay your next chemo infusion, but that will give some extra time to raise your WBC, take care of the UTI, solve the pain in your teeth and recover from your mild case of shingles. I'm wishing you well, NCBeachGIrl!",

Through constant nursing I seem to have avoided a full-on sinus infection. This time around, the only SE I've experienced so far is an afternoon and evening of feeling extremely tired and sleepy on Day 3. My energy level seems to have revived today, after 10 hours of sleep!

I have no experience with Ativan/Lorazepam, but I've looked up the differences between them and here's what I've found: Ativan (Lorazepam) helps you relax, is effective for occasional or short-term anxiety, is less likely to have drug interactions but more likely to cause withdrawal symptoms compared to similar drugs. Can cause memory problems, drowsiness, dizziness and confusion; can be habit-forming, so not typically used for long-term treatment; more likely to cause withdrawal if taken for a long time and suddenly stopped; many find it gets less effective over time. Used for Anxiety and Insomnia. Buspar (Buspirone) helps you relax, is effective for treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), is less effective for short-term use. Works very well to control symptoms of GAD and does not cause physical dependence or withdrawal symptoms. It is only available as a generic, so the cost is low. Can take as long as 4 weeks to become fully effective, not as effective for short-term anxiety conditions or panic disorders. Most people find it loses effectiveness over long periods of time, can cause drowsiness or dizziness when you first start so be careful of activities that require mental alertness until you are used to the medication. Used for Anxiety. In response to your question about whether you should be taking Ativan daily...based on the online info, I would say probably not. But this is something you should discuss with your physician. My doctor was very helpful. I didn't want to become dependent upon an anti-anxiety med, so she suggested Buspirone. Being my primary care physician, she was able to check for drug interactions with any other meds I am taking. And when I told her that I couldn't have drowsiness or dizziness impacting driving or work, she suggested I take 5mg at bedtime. She did warn me that as time goes on, Buspirone may become less effective, which is why I started with a low dose. 5mg has been very effective for me, and so far, all I need. Good Luck with Taxol #4 on Friday!",

The other had a bad reaction to anesthesia and remained in the hospital overnight instead of the outpatient procedure that was intended. I saw her today on her way to a followup visit with her surgeon and she is quite uncomfortable and wearing a drainage tube due to the number of lymph nodes removed.

Unfortunately, the post-surgery pathology is not as good or clear-cut. Following neo-adjuvant chemo my scans looked very optimistic - the large breast tumor and positive lymph node (diagnosed by core needle biopsy in Apr) either no longer showed up or had gotten considerably smaller; thus, I opted for conservative surgery. But the lumpectomy excised a 5.2cm area of tissue scattered with residual cancer, which was also found in 2/4 sentinel lymph nodes. The original tumor was obviously larger than the 4cm estimate (approximated by physical exam, since my BC has never shown well on scans). \"Standard of Care\" would have been a mastectomy and ALND - removal of some (or all) Level I and II non-sentinel lymph nodes. Per my surgeon, the decision for me now is to either 1) rely upon radiation therapy to clear any residual cancer there might still be left; or 2) have additional surgery to do the mastectomy and/or ALND. So many decisions to make! The data on radiation alone does not apply to my size tumor and neo-adjuvant chemo. ALND alone or ALND and a mastectomy? If I have a mastectomy, do I want a bilateral mastectomy? Should I have reconstruction? Does reconstruction hamper diagnosis? I'm consulting with my medical oncologist tomorrow morning, a radiation oncologist on Monday, and my long-time PCP on what treatment plan is best for me. I am open to any data, opinions and experiences in order to come to a decision that will give me the most peace of mind and the best possible outcome. Wish me a clear head and good luck! *Note: My surgeon did have one bit of good news for me - clean margins! But when I spoke with my PCP, who also received a copy of the pathology report, she said my margins were \"almost\" clear. The margin on the side of the excised cancer closest to my breast bone measured 0.1 (or .01?). It seems that even criteria for \"clear margins\" varies.",

Right now I'm sitting in a very chilly waiting room. After a year and 4 months I'm finally having my IV port removed and for that I'm checking in 2 hours before the procedure and will need to be picked up because of the 'twilight' anesthesia. Others had told me they just went into their surgeon's office and had it removed in an exam room! I'm glad that both our scares were benign. On Nov 1 I'll be having my 6-month ultrasound on my right to check the benign fibroadenoma AND a 3-D mammogram of my left which is my BC side. You have a good memory - I did ask my radiation oncologist for an MRI and after I finished radiation therapy in early February I had my annual 3-D mammogram (this is when they found the fibroadenoma and I went on to have an ultrasound of the right and a biopsy). 3 weeks later I had an MRI that looked ok. I'm not sure if I will have an MRI every year or every other, but it's a relief to have that baseline MRI to compare to. My doctor warned me that my left breast would feel firm after the lumpectomy and would gradually soften. It's been almost a year since surgery and only recently have I noticed that the swelling is gone and my bc left breast does look smaller than my right. There's an area of numbness on the side closest to my arm, probably caused my nerve damage. I don't know if that will improve. The neuropathy in my feet and fingers continues. The fingers are getting better so I'm hopeful that my feet will too. I continue to take 600mg of alpha lipoic acid a day. I'm counting on letrozole to help keep the cancer from recurring or spreading, but I admit, it makes me feel old! My knees ache and are stiff, and yes, I have neutropenia in my left hip. But most of all I think the estrogen blocker makes my skin look older! Oh well, all my complaints are minor. BC really helped me get my priorities in order! It's good to 'talk' again and to know you're doing ok! Time for me to go now - a nursing student is going to put an IV in my arm! Take care     ",

But I get that writing, reading, hearing about cancer is not always welcomed when you're going through it. I also check this thread less frequently - spending more time and effort on getting back to normalcy. It will soon be 2 years since my diagnosis. I still have neuropathy in my fingers and feet and occasionally feel that I'm developing lymphedema in my left arm, but haven't had this confirmed. Thank you for sharing that exercise is the best medicine - I haven't been babying myself and had begun to worry that I was overdoing. I'm post menopause so it's letrozole for me - and my biggest complaints are that I can't seem to lose weight (in fact, I'm gaining back what I had lost, which is not pleasing my doctors) and joint pain, which I'm willing to tolerate if the letrozole will keep the cancer at bay (fingers crossed). I'm still working, family and social life are thriving - all in all, life is good! Thank you for the update, Parakeets. Congratulations on the clear scans! Keep managing your meds in the best way for you. I'm so impressed that you're doing Crossfit! And I wish you the best as you make your decision to have a child. Be well, be happy!",

I'm so new to this (DX 4/12/17) that I haven't a clue, though I am one of those who will be having 4 treatments of AC biweekly over 8 weeks, followed by 12 treatments of Taxol, weekly. I read on another thread that spreading the 12 Taxol treatments over 12 weeks lessens the SE, but don't know if that's true. Now that I know your oncologist prefers 4 rounds of dose dense Taxol biweekly, I'll have to ask my oncologist why the difference in approach. Did you have a lot of SE with the dose dense dosage?",

And if I'm very lucky and there ISa correlation between pregnancy and chemo treatment, I won't suffer from nausea. Never felt better as when I was pregnant ...but that was 30+ years ago! Mom_of_Twins, I spoke to my MO's nurse practitioner today and finally had a chance to ask about 12 rounds of Taxol weekly vs 4 rounds of dose dense Taxol biweekly. Her response confirms what Kicks and KB870 have said - everyone reacts differently and uniquely. She said that chemotherapy drugs and delivery are not only based on the individual's cancer, but also factors such as age, overall health & fitness and tolerability. Your MO must have made the right decision for you, since you tolerated the dose dense Taxol so well. I on the other hand, at age 64 and not at my physical best (to say the least) will likely have fewer SEs if I have 12 lower doses weekly. Interestingly, I learned that my neo adjuvant AC chemo is considered dose dense. I'll have 4 rounds, biweekly, starting on May 18. Then it's on to Taxol for 12 weeks, Wish me luck. I've made note of the many helpful hints from all of you so I feel I'm as prepared as I can be. Thank you!",
