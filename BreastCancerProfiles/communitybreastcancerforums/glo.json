My tumor markers were high and I had to have a pet scan and showed cancer cells in the lining of my pleura and one by my sternum, I had a mastectomy and recently been on arimidex and now am on faslodex. I would be real interested to hear from someone who was on faslodex also. I have been so down someone out there help pick me up! My doctor says to have a positive attitude I did until this happened a second time DONT KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF THIS MOOD! Thanks Glo. Log in to post a reply",
