I feel like an old timer and was only diagnosed 02/28. I am 36 with two beautiful girls. Treatment varies for everybody. I am stage IIIB/C and and my tx involves 4 months of chemo and  8 weeks of radiation. Some patients get Herceptin for a year if they are Her2+. You should bring up all pains to my onc. Most of the time it is nothing but it good to tell your onc everything so they can check it out. On your question regarding mast vs lump that will depend on you and your onc and if your surgeon was able to get clean margins. There is no one answer for everyone. In my case I do not have a choice and will be getting a bilat mast after my chemo is completed. Good luck.",

My PET says improvement and reduction in mets in liver, bones, nodes and does not even mention lungs. The two CT's that I read today show progression in lungs and liver and new lesion in hips. Does anyone else have unreliable PETs? I am bummed that Navelbine has not worked. I am meeting with onc on Monday and hopefully she will change chemo. She just sent me an email saying PET looked great but CT was confusing. Confusing? The CT indicates clear progression to me. I am really disappointed as my TMs have dropped, liver function has improved. I had hoped for better results. Navelbine has been very hard on me but I was ok with it if it was working. Now it appears it is not. My left lobe of the liver which was full of cancer is much better but my right lobe which was clean is now filled with cancer also. Lungs are worse. My brain MRI is not for another few weeks so I do not know if brain mets are back but I have started to have headaches again. Well, on to a new treatment with new hope. Thanks for reading.

I guess chemo is working on some strain on the cancer and not on the others as some tumors regress while new ones continue to grow. My family is more upset than I am.

Regression in lungs, and most tumors in the liver but one new tumor in the liver grew. But the trial let me stay on. Side effects are much easier than any chemo I have been on the past. I have a lot of headaches but I do not know if they are from my brain mets or migraines triggered by TDM1. I have fatigue for a couple of days. It does seem as easy as promised n the news.

So I don't even know what my stage is anymore. I will never know for sure as I am having neo-adj chemo and hopefully most of the tumor will be gone when they do the mast. Every doctor visit and report has made things worse. Yesterday I had a followup MRI which was the first positive report since the whole thing started. It actually showed improvement in the tumor because of chemo. ",

My bones have stayed stable, my main tumors which were in the left lobe of my liver keep shrinking but new tumors keep coming and growing in the right lobe of my liver. I am ER and PR - but Her2 positive. My MO thinks the cancer in the right lobe may have changed pathology and become triple negative. We are very confused since I have progression in the right lobe and regression in the left lobe. I have spent the last two days researching options with my MO. She wants to biopsy the new tumors to find out if pathology has changed and we should stop using only her2 agents.",

My new pathology report from the cancer center says I have both IDC and DCIS! And my DCIS tumor is ER+70% and PR+ 30% while IDC is triple negative. How could they have missed this? I am still new to this and do not know much about DCIS (figured I did not have it so have not researched it yet) but is pretty common to also have DCIS with ?

I am so sorry to hear this news. I have no advise. My situation is bad and I have accepted that I am dying soon and have forgotten how to live and it is hard to be in denial when you are always sick. Every scan brings more bad news and I feel like I am slowly walking towards the gallows. After getting horrible results on Monday, I spent all day yesterday in an Ativan haze and it helped as i was not sobbing non stop. Faith does not provide comfort nor does having a bucket list. But doing small things with my kids makes them very happy (we baked pies on the weekend). I try to do the small things I can and the kids are happy to lie down and read with me. I have always admired your approach and how you seem to be in the present. Why change if you are happy? I am inspired by how you to choose to live. Death when it comes will make it itself very real. So why change your life now? I am trying to become more like you:)",

Fonseca Pathology Department, Instituto Portugueˆs de Oncologia de Lisboa Francisco Gentil, Rua Professor Lima Basto, 1099-023 Lisbon, Portuga BRIEF REPORT Abstract Introduction Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is a rare but rapidly fatal event in the natural history of breast cancer [1]. HER2? breast cancer has an increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) metastases [2] but there are little data on LC frequency in these tumors [3]. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor, is highly effective in systemic control of HER2? metastatic breast cancer [4] but it is not clear if it can penetrate the intact blood brain barrier (BBB) [5]. We report the case of a patient who received weekly intrathecal (IT) trastuzumab for LC from HER2? breast cancer for 18 months, with impressive neurological benefit. Case report A 40 year-old woman presented in April 2003 with a left- sided cT4bN1M0 estrogen receptor (ER) positive (70% of cells) invasive ductal carcinoma. She received six cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU 500 mg/m2, epirubicin 100 mg/m. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against the HER2 receptor, is a major breakthrough in the treat- ment of HER2? breast cancer. However, its high molec- ular weight precludes it from crossing the intact blood\u2013 brain barrier, making the central nervous system a sanc- tuary to HER2? breast cancer metastases. We prospec- tively assessed functional outcome and toxicity of administering trastuzumab directly into the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) and brain metastases from HER2? breast cancer that had already been treated with other intrathecal chemotherapy, with no benefit. Upon signed informed consent, weekly lumbar puncture with administration of trastuzumab 25 mg was begun to a 44 year-old women with metastatic breast cancer (lymph node, bone, lung, and liver involvement) previously treated with tamoxifen, letrozole, anthracy- clines, taxanes, capecitabine, intravenous trastuzumab, and lapatinib. She received 67 weekly administrations of intrathecal trastuzumab with marked clinical improvement and no adverse events. She survived 27 months after LC diagnosis. A complete leptomeningeal response, with no evidence of leptomeningeal metastasis at necropsy, was achieved. We believe that intrathecal trastuzumab admin- istration should be prospectively evaluated to confirm clinical activity and optimize dose, schedule, and duration of treatment.

Everyone treats you differently because you look sick. I have never worn wigs but I was on disability right away and did not have to face the world. In hindsight, if I had to do it again I would wear wigs and use makeup to force myself to be normal and forget this cancer for some time. I am 42 and looking at myself in the mirror is the hardest for me. It is tough being bald in the winter. I live in S Cal so even though it is not bad it still feels cold to my bald head:).

It is bittersweet to watch my parents run the home with dh and the kids doing fine. It is reassuring to know things wil be fine and life is running smoothly while i stay holed up in bed. If something were to happen to my dh, my younger brother who lives across the country would get the kids. My parents are too old to take legal responsibility. How that would work out from a parctical school, house standpoint, I do not know but I am not worried about that option yet.

My breast MRI last week was also with contrast but indicated a 20mm spot on my liver--just happened to see it. On Monday, I am getting another liver MRI with contrast. At this point, I am hoping for a miracle that says the breast MRI was wrong and the spot looks the same on the liver MRI. The radiologist saw blood vessels in the spot during the breast MRI which means it is some tumor--doesn't it?. Also I do not think hemangiomas grow in size and only cancer grows. That is why I am super worried. But why would it grow on chemo when the BC cancer went in remission? My onc does not like to do a biopsy either so we will see what happens Monday.  I just need to be patient.....be patient...be calm...Thank you.",

I was not diabetic before but had gestational diabeties with both my children so i am familiar with insulin and carb counting. I have been on decadron a lot with my txs and the cancer along with decadron has made me diabetic last month. Even without steriods my fasting is around 150 and is 250 to 300 fasting with decadron. My sugars stay in the 250- 350 range all day. My oncs say insulin is too dangerous for me since I do not eat well, have nausea and I take steriods inconsistently. They have put me on metformin and the sugar numbers above are with metformin. They have told me to ignore my sugars as I have bigger problems, the impact of high sugars takes place over long term and I will not be around. I met three oncs and they all said the same thing. Insulin would be dangerous and diabeties was the least of my problems. I am vegetarian and the only thing that I can eat these days is fresh fruit and smoothies. I cannot handle eggs or any protein. Anyway just venting if diabetic veterans have any suggestions on handling decadron or veg protien ideas. I am losing weight as I am scared to eat anything with my sugars being so high. I wish I had not developed a meat aversion during chemo but I just cannot handle meat anymore. I know drs are telling to ignore sugars but it is hard to accept that I will not live long enough to deal with the implications of diabeties even though I know it is true.

Onc gave me a long lecture on forgetting my diabeties completely and eating whatever I want, whenever I want. I guess my onc knows how bad things are and she is trying to tell me to live life. I need to start doing that but it is hard. Thank you for letting me vent and understanding my challenge. Just reading your responses makes me feel like some one gets me and does not think I am crazy for thinking about this when I have so many other problems.

Yesterday when I went for infusion (week 4), they did not give me Navelbine as my ANS was only 594(abs neutrophils .6). The nurse said no to Neupogen or Neulasta and they asked me to come back next week. Do you get shots on a regular basis to prevent this? Does everyone get a week off? Right now I am scheduled for tx every week with no week off. Onc wants me to complete 2 cycles (8 txs) and then get a PET. I am wondering whether I should insist on Neupogen to prevent this happening in the future. I think Neulasta is not an option since I have weekly tx.

I had a liver CT scan in Oct 07 which showed 2 spots on my liver 10mm on the left and 17 mm on the right. Feb 22 08 I was diagnosed with BC. I had a followup bone scan, chest xray and MRI of liver, abdomen and pelvis and all were ok but the liver MRI showed a 14mm spot on the left side and no spot on the right side. My bc is very aggressive, large tumor with multiple nodes and my onc started me on neo adj chemo right away. She said she would not biopsy the liver yet as it looked like an hemangioma but follow up with another liver MRI half way through chemo. I just finished 4 AC tx and had a followup breast MRI last week which showed a partial remission in the breast with improvements in chest wall, most lymph nodes now look normal and 2/3 reduction in the tumor. However the radiologist happened to see a 20mm spot on my liver on the left side. I have a liver MRI scheduled for Monday but I am going crazy with worry. My onc had said that if the spot had not changed in size and my breast showed remission, she would assume it was not mets. But from the breast MRI , it appears that the spot has grown. She tried to reassure me, that we need to compare the new liver MRI to the liver MRI from 2 months ago and not read too much into what the breast MRI says. She said her logic is if it was mets is would have the same biology and there is no reason for it go grow if breast cancer shows remission. What are your thoughts on this? I know I will have answers in a couple of weeks. If the liver MRI on Monday shows an increase I will push for a biopsy. But is it possible it is mets and the breast tumor is responding so well to chemo and the liver continues to grow. I am going crazy with worry and have been living with this uncertainity of the liver for over two months now.Any advice? Initially diagnosed with triple neg stage 3 bc in Feb 2008. Mets dx in Feb 2012 with change in receptors .Mets to liver, brain, bone, lung and nodes and central nervous system.

I would like them to forget me as quickly as possible, so they do not hurt and I do not plan on creating anything for them. Everyone is trying to get me to start something for them and how no one can forget their mom. But for me, if they forget me they will not miss me--that is my logic anyway. I may come around one day but I want everyone to forget me so they can move on with their lives. I wish we could all pretend at home that mommy is away on a LONG business trip  and they did not have to face this reality so young. MY dh will be a great parent but I worry constantly how he will cope on his own. I convince myself everyday that I am not indispensable and my kids will not be the only ones to grow up without their mom. They are great kids. I guess what I grieve most daily is more that I will not be able to see what they become as adults, who they marry etc. This is the hardest part of this journey for me.

This was sudden and the extent of mets was very hard to take. I spent all of Feb crying nonstop, but went on disability and started tx. I started an easy chemo Navelbine but am having many s/e. I also had a reaction to the Zometa both times with high fevers. But I was coming to terms with it, my liver numbers began to improve a bit and this forum helped me. I began to hope that I could be one of the lucky ones who get a couple of years. I realize that it could not be much longer since I am hormone negative and will always have chemo.  Then last week I started having non stop headaches. I do not know why--I do have large mouth sores from Navelbine but who knows. With my history, it most likely brain mets. I cannot get myself to get a brain MRI. I have barely come to terms with my existing mets. My brain was the only place left.  I am tired of giving bad news to my family. My chemo will have to stop while I get tx for my brain and then my liver will go haywire. I know I am running ahead without a scan but am unable to stop these thoughts as my head pounds constantly. I know I should get a brain MRI but I cannot bring myself to call my onc. I want to be mentally ready for the next steps. I hate opening my eyes in the morning as I begin to feel my headache again. I wish I could stop tx and end all this but know that I cannot because of my kids. With mets everywhere, I struggle with suffering through tx but know I have to keep trying even if there a small flicker of hope. Left to myself, I know I would get off this train. Sorry for the long post but I needed to vent. I feel like just when I managed to bring myself up, another huge wave is coming again at me. Initially diagnosed with triple neg stage 3 bc in Feb 2008.

      "Content": "formygirls wrote: Ladies. I do not know how to ride this roller coaster. Early last month I was dx with extensive mets to lungs, liver, bones and nodes. This was sudden and the extent of mets was very hard to take. I spent all of Feb crying nonstop, but went on disability and started tx. I started an easy chemo Navelbine but am having many s/e. I also had a reaction to the Zometa both times with high fevers. But I was coming to terms with it, my liver numbers began to improve a bit and this forum helped me. I began to hope that I could be one of the lucky ones who get a couple of years. I realize that it could not be much longer since I am hormone negative and will always have chemo.  Then last week I started having non stop headaches. I do not know why--I do have large mouth sores from Navelbine but who knows. With my history, it most likely brain mets. I cannot get myself to get a brain MRI. I have barely come to terms with my existing mets. My brain was the only place left.  I am tired of giving bad news to my family. My chemo will have to stop while I get tx for my brain and then my liver will go haywire. I know I am running ahead without a scan but am unable to stop these thoughts as my head pounds constantly. I know I should get a brain MRI but I cannot bring myself to call my onc. I want to be mentally ready for the next steps. I hate opening my eyes in the morning as I begin to feel my headache again. I wish I could stop tx and end all this but know that I cannot because of my kids. With mets everywhere, I struggle with suffering through tx but know I have to keep trying even if there a small flicker of hope. Left to myself, I know I would get off this train. Sorry for the long post but I needed to vent. I feel like just when I managed to bring myself up, another huge wave is coming again at me. Initially diagnosed with triple neg stage 3 bc in Feb 2008.

I still have cancer but the dr said 2/3 of the tumor had shrunk. Instead of a bunch of matted lymph nodes with cancer only one node is still swollen and my chest wall involvement has decreased. My onc said while this was not a complete remission which occurs in 10% of the cases, she was happy with the progress after 4 ac. I am on to the 4 taxol which starts next week and will have surgery after all the chemo is completed. I have mixed feelings about the report--I am grateful that there has been some improvement and some remission but there is still some tumor left. The MRI again found a spot on my liver. The good news is the the spot on the liver has not grown/changed in size in the last two months which the onc feels is a positive sign because if it was cancer the spot would have also reduced in size in response to the chemo but the spot also showed blood vessels which means it is a tumor--hopefully benign.",

I have practically working with on who will pick them up for school, help them with prom clothes, who will call dh every evening to remind him to come home, my best friednd will help with homework etc. I am blessed that my parents came from India and are going to live with my dh and my kids to bring them up. My mom is an angel and is trying her best to fill my shoes per my instructions. She is letting me move in piece knowing there will be someone to watch and raise my kids. My dh is a great husband but he is a workaholic. they cry and then I distract them. This will not get easier till I actually go. There are moments I fantasize that that my PET, CT, BRAIN MRI, SPRINE MRI will also show !NED on the same day and I get a reprieve with no txs for 6 months!!!! One can dream. The plan was initially not to talk unless there was major progression. Or tx change that would everyone. Unfortunately, since my dx in Feb, I have had progression every month and tx has changed so often. So we never got the time to sit, calm down and absorb that things will be ok. Got one news, barely got up and then hit us again. ,",

I had a great corporate job(marketing) which I left yesterday after I was diagnosed with extensive mets to bones, nodes, lung and most of my liver yesterday. This is still new to me. I just turned 40! I discovered this site when I was first diagnosed as a stage III TNBC in Feb 2008. Feb is a bad month for me:( I do not have a tx plan yet so I will be asking lots of questions in the coming days. Please bear with me. I plan to be glued here every waking moment as no one else gets this nightmare and no one else also inspires me to keep fighting. This has been my lifelife since I got the call my onc.",

Since then I have had a few progressions and my MRI this week showed 5 new lesions in my brain that need to be treated. My treatment team does not want me to get WBR because: 1) rad onc feels they can treat me with radiosurgery again. 2)I also have too much systemic disease and cannot be off chemo for three weeks to get WBR 3)I can do WBR only once and they want to save it till the end 4)I am not in a great physical shape for WBR as I am having a tough time on my chemo of Xeloda, Afinitor, tykerb, Herceptin and Zometa. BUT my ins (CIGNA)has denied me treatment for radiosurgery and will only pay for WBR. They have a lifetime limit of only seven lesions for radiosurgery and they say I have exceeded that. This treatment will cost between $15 and $30,000. My doctors have already appealed and lost. CIGNA is insisting I do WBR if I want treatment but my rad onc is insisting I can get by with radiosurgery and I should keep WBR in my back pocket. My rad doc says tx has to be done in the next two weeks otherwise my MRI and CT will have to repeated. Do you have suggestions for me for appealing this through a state agency or some other option? I live in CA. I would really like to avoid WBR for now. If all fails, we will tap into my life ins or 401k but I hate using money that I would like to leave for my kids.

My onc is trying to get a biopsy of my lungs or liver next week hoping that my markets may change. I am meeting with my onc on Mon morning and I want to impress upon her that I do not want to give up yet. I like her and know she will support me. I go to amjor cancer center here. When I asked her what we should do next, she mentioned that depended on my goals --was a QOL more imp or was I willing to try to fight with chemo. I am very determined to fight this to the extent I can--especially after reading all the posts in this forum. You have all inspired me to fight. I am encouraging my dh to register here also as he needs strenght. My onc gave me the option of starting chemo right away or waiting for a couple of weeks till my biopsy results come in. I told her I would like to start right away as my liver is in a bad state(my numbers are high and I am running a fever). Is that the right decision? Thank you all. I hope to get to know all of you better in the coming days, months and maybe years.",

I am 40 with two young girls who are 8 and 10 and get so pissed off when I have to listen for hours about knee and other old age problems of other people and they try to compare their problems with mine. I get mad at myself as I am not a bad person but I get jealous when I see older people. It is not their fault that I have to leave soon. I am glad you were able to attend your dd graduation. My older daughter graduates from elementary school (5 grade) on JUne 6 and she keeps asking me if I will be around and I keep reassuring her that I plan on being there for her graduation. This is the only graduation I will probably be around for so it will bittersweet. In my day dreams, I am around to see them both graduate from high school and very willingly agree to die after the graduation ceremony:) that is a pact I keep making with the higher powers.",

I see my main onc tomorow but will hold off on all tx till my second opinion.We are concerned that MD might not  enroll me in clinical trials if I start chemo in San Diego. Is that ok? Time is critical since my liver is in crtical condition but I do not feel as if I have any other choice if I want a second opinion. My primary onc will give me her tx plan tomorrow. I also have a PET tomorrow.",
