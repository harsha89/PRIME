Missing a wedding is a Big Deal. This S.... Sure does get in the way of LIFE Mama I agree. There are no parts like our own parts. And I think I'm OK with \"just\" a lumpectomy. I think I'm mostly upset with how much time this will be taking out of my life.(besides the waiting and not knowing)...not looking forward to recovery, Rads and then continued follow up. Life is short and seems to be getting shorter ;-). But then I need to be present every day and realize none of us are really in control.....we just think or pretend we are. I'm trying to think of this as a chronic disease. Something that will need to be managed for the rest of my life. Every day really is a gift...The Present. And I don't want to waste too much Thanks and good wishes to all of you on this board. Even though I haven't written much the majority of everyone here gives me hope and makes me feel that I am not crazy for the roller coaster emotions. Even for such a benign thing like the PreOp vist",

I was scared re wire placement because my tumor is very sensitive. But it wasn't bad at all. The radiologist and US tech were great. In fact the entire crew was great. And being in health care myself I'm fussy. Today I'm at home lying around, a bit wobbly on my feet but able to navigate. Slept like a log last night. Still tender mostly at the node sites but taking Tylenol even though I have Vicodin. Surprisingly I feel emotionally much better. The tumor was small. 1.4 cm. and mixed lobar ductal grade 2 but I feel good about doing a lumpectomy. Statistics can be a skewed at worse but I still felt there was no advantage to doing a mastectomy. Still waiting on the final path report...1 node lit up and 2 small clumps were faint so will wait until the 13th ( yep that's Friday) for final results. Thanks for the support I got from here. I felt like the worst part is the mental \"what if what if what if\". And reading here helped me Hope this helps the next steps for someone.....",

I'm sorry you are back to this list, but glad you thought it was worthwhile enough to return. I came across this group accidentally trying to piece together what it all meant. Still don't have all the answers but found the voices here gave me something that can't be described in words. Peacestrength. I had ULX w SNB on the 5th. I count myself very fortunate ...no drains and I TOOK A SHOWER TODAY. Talk about pampering...I even washed my hair! Good wishes for best results for our other September sisters.",

As soon as you say breast cancer people say weird things. One of them had to tell me about how she insisted on a BMX so she would be cured, but only because she was so aggressive in her insistence did her surgeon finally give in. And now she doesn't worry any more. What? Am I missing something here? I'm usually level headed and cheerful. This whole thing would be much better for me if I didn't keep getting advice from others.....but they would just listening IF I wanted to talk about IT. the closer it gets the less patience I have. I usually walk and work in my studio doing wet felting, preparing fleece, dyeing, and other fiber activities to relax and destress. Today I want to sit on the couch. I haven't had a good night's sleep since my diagnosis....keep walking up 2 or more times a night. I'm sure that has something to do with my attitude. Sorry to rant. But I'm thinking this group Gets It. Best wishes to you all during The Wait.",

Mamasixtaz....do something really nice for yourself. A wonderful distraction. I'm thinking it doesn't get any easier with every surgery. My ULX was on 9/5 but I won't get results re anything until 9/13. I am practicing developing more patience than I ever thought I could. My post op phone call was \"surgery went well, SN and 2 other small clumps were blue so i took them also\". Nothing about any predictions. I felt so much better after the surgery...now I'm on that roller coaster again....do I have clear margins? What does having blue nodes mean? Are they positive? I need to go practice saying. \"Fiddle deedee\". I'll get to that bridge eventually. Blessings and strength to those next in September surgery",
