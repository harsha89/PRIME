Well my boys - age 11 and 8- thought it was hilarious.  Lots of laughter all around.  Apparently my dh tells the boys if they can find the bumper sticker he will get one.  Since then the boys have been able to tell a few friends about the sticker and had gotten to use the actual word ass. Which would have been ground for serious trouble normally. Well my boys have just laughed and laughed deep dowm from their bellies. My oldest has been having a hard time with dx so hearing  his laughter is like music to my ears. So much better then any tv , books etc.  I love the sound of their laughter.  And we'll it's true I got my ass kickin boots on. Lol. ( or slippers depending on the day).  So long story , sorry.  Does anyone know where I can find this sticker ? Have you seen this before?   To God be the glory! Live, laugh, love...

She has thankfully not had progression.she was my support back then and still is esp  since my  stage 4 dx a year ago when so many friends drifted away for some crazy reason.  My friend told him a little if my story ( without my knowing ) mets to bone , married , 2 young children, no prescription plan and although med ins pays 80% , 20% copay adds up quickly with cancer treatment.  The reporter is a young man and says he know very little about bc and realit nothing of mbc. He would like to interview both friend and I for different realities of cancer.  Long story but here is the question finally :  pride is keeping me from letting friend set up a donation acct at a local bank to raise funds for medical costs.  She could do this and mention it at the interview with newspaper to get the news out. I feel good about getting my story out there - ESP since my mental mood is so much more hopeful now(thanks a lot to bco for that).i hope it can encourage someone with a new stage 4dx and make other people get a glance into my stage 4 life  But not sure about the donation acct. it feels like I am begging.  We def need help with med and prescription costs but why   Do I feel so low down, worthless person to allow that to be in the interview ? I don't work now and am on disability so the whole not working for money has been embarrassing for me as well.  I do want to mention in the interview the % of donations to komen that actually gets spent on salaries. I also think if people want to make a donation they should find a cancer patient actually in treatment and give them the donation directly. everyone knows someone with cancer and if not they can find someone at either of our local cancer centers 5 days a week the lobby is full. If you know the cancer patients family well another great way to help is bring supper once a week or once a month, whatever you want to do.  So lose the pride or you guys agree it sounds just too whining, begging , pitiful  ?  To God be the glory!

It helps me realize I am not alone and other people are having the same problems as me.  I was dx with stage 2 breast cancer in 2002 when I was 31. Had a bileteral mastectomy, chemo and radiation.  Skip forward to June 2013 and found out cancer returned and mets to spine and pelvis.  I have 2 children (11 and 8) and a wonderful hubby.  The emotional ride is so hard.  I am not worried about dying. I am worried about how my family is dealing with it. My 8 year old is handling it best. So concerned about my 11 year old. He is keeping everything inside , wants to be left alone, lots of crying.  He had talked to his school counselor and hated it. He doesn't want to talk to us or anyone else about it. Any suggestions?  I miss his laughter and loving spirit.   To God be the glory! Live, laugh, love... Life is way too short.
