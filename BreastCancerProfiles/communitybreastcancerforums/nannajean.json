It quite honestly scares me that I will have to continue with this forever.  I want to leave the Cancer and it's baggage behind me. Nannajean",

You guys rock (not the music kind) I don't know what I would do without you all, Thanks Nannajean",

Help you guys you all have been through this, give my some advise. Nannajean Log in to post a reply",

It's great to see your picture too I will have to do that (before I loose my hair) First, I must tell you that my cancer is (IDC) but it is not a stage 3 but a grade 3, I am new to all this cancer lingo.  I will be having a bone and CT scan to help determine the stage.  I am going in to the hospital to day for the dissection and they are keeping me until Saturday as they have booked my bone scan for Friday, so things are moving quickly for me, which is good. Do you think this is the best discussion board or should I be on connection with others with similar diagnosis? I have to leave for the hospital shortly but I intend to go in there to kick some butt and leave no cancer in my body.  This is a challange I will overcome with all my super support group here and the super support on this site. Hugs right back at you and we will be talking soon. Jean",

I know that the CT scan would have shown lung cancer if it was there but that was back in January and when I saw the other oncologist in March(8 month checkup) and she was so negative I have been really scared and kind of paranoid. I am wondering if this breathlessness is in my head or if it is part of the effects of meds, chemo, and rads.  Of course I am afraid to go to the doctor, it seems since 2009 I live in doctors offices and I hate it.  I don't want to burden my family of friends as they really have no idea what we go through, only all of you know what it is like because you live it just like me. I want to just forget breast cancer and live a normal life and I wonder if that will ever happen, that damn cancer is always on my mind. Nannajean Log in to post a reply",
