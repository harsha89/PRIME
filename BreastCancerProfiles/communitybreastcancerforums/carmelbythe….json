After that she developed a large swelling and hardening in her effected breast. Her radiation got postponed due to this condition and her Dr. ordered an ultrasound to see what was going on. While she was on table for test she \"broke free\" so to speak and since they couldn't stop bleeding, she was wheeled into ER (she was in the right place at the right time on that day, thank God). It was drained well there and continued to for next few days at home until she got an appt with her surgeon. He said it was a hematoma/seroma and her body should naturally absorb most of it and it would go down on it's own. A week later she opted for another quick \"clean up\" surgery (sorry don't know the technical term) so she could start her radiation treatment within the ideal timeframe from her first surgeries. She has been perfect eversince. I hope this helps and wish you great strength as you continue your treatment. May I just say while I'm on (this is my first post), this website has been invaluable to my mother and I for the wealth of info and support it provides. We would've been quite lost without the education found here. Every woman I've read about in a quest to find answers for my mother has left me awestruck and I'll continue to pray for your strong spirits and perfect healings. - Cheryl",
