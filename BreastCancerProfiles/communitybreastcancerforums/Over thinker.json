I has grown larger over the years but I have also gained weigh, is that normal? I just went for my first \u201cscreening mammogram\u201d and have recieved the call back for a \u201cdiagnostic screening\u201d I told them about the lump prior to the 3D mamo. Has anyone else had this situation and find out it is cancer? It feels hard, about 2in by 4in. How worried should I be Log in to post a reply",
