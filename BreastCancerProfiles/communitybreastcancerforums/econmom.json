Anyone else experience this?  I am concerned it could be the beginning of LE.  I am getting my sleeve and glove on Wednesday from my LE therapist and I am hoping wearing it a bit each day might improve things.

While I never had a definitive finding of cancer in the nodes (the needle biopsy of one palpable node came out negative), my left axilla \"lit up like a Christmas tree\" on the pre-chemo MRI.  I too am very worried about lymphedema, expecially because I am left-handed, so I am hoping to lose as few nodes as possible. ",
