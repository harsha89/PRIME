I was looking like a zombie, no costume needed for Haloween's eve. hahaha. But one week later it was growing back soooo fast. I only stayed one week with no eyebrows. And same with my lashes. I used a crayon from MAC that was really simple to drawn my eyebrows plus an eyeshadow the same color to fill. Here is th name:Fling Eye Brows( crayon) and you pick the best color for you and I used some eye shadow with the brush number 266, from MAC also. It helped me a lot during this period. They are the last to fall and first to grow back. best",
