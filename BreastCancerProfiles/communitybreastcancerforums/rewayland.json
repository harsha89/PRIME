I have hadÂ lymedema specialist work on my arm but that was before the pain. It is so frustrating because we go through so much to survive the chemo the radiation, the surgery and we are beset with this. It is not enough pain to stop me in my tracks but it hurts day and night and it limits what i can do, i can't close the hatchback on the car, cant shut the sunroof..yet it is unrelenting. A sneeze is so painful, never mind a cough, I dread having a cold..God Forbid. Anyremedies out there? I am reluctant to start Naprosyn but it is starting to invade my tempermant.",

I do beleive that the jacuzzi helps and wearing my sleeve has helped with the LE. We have moved a fair distance from my LE PT so I cannot go back to them but I may try to find one specialist locally to see if they can help. I like the idea of the lido patches fro walgreens or wherever. We used lido alot for intractable pain that was nerve root in origin ( i am a retired onc and critical care nurse..hair of the dog ). Anyway, I am not going to work out my pecs, but rather see if I can keep them loose. I will keep you all posted to see if it works. Good luck to us all! I think we may find remedies as a group rather than rely on the medical/surgical collegues at this point.",
