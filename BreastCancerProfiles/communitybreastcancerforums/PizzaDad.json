But she said give me another treatment and we are doing Halaven. ",

My older son turns 16 Tuesday.  My wife doesnt' like the idea of telling him this so close to his birthday.  Maybe we will delay it till Wednesday.  I'm starting to lean that way.  Just let the Birthday come and pass without this knowledge.  We have met with her first husband (my 16 year old's father) and told him. Probably a situation some others here have worried about.  What happens to the children in a blended family in the event of death.  As a father I understand why he will want his son living with him but am worried about losing touch with the boy I raised and love and worried about his sense of the world being shattered and being torn from the home he has been raised in and being seperated from his brother.  I have promised Elka that I will do everything I can to make sure that this family continues to be a family.",

Stage 4.  If I had it to do over, I would beg my wife to get a BMX.  Take everything associated with her breast the first time they detected anything.  Would it have made a difference?  I have no idea.  The cancer may have already spread beyond the breast tissue. Hind sight is twenty twenty.  Current medical philosophy says I'm wrong but when I mentioned it to my wife she said she felt the same way.  I absolutely love my wife.  Fake boobs or no boobs would have suited me just fine.  Losing her does not. When they told her she could just do a lumpectamy instead of BMX I think part of the decision process was made in a state of emotional numbness and part of it was autopilot because we have constantly been bombarded with newsette reporting that talks about how breast cancer treatment no longer requires the loss of a breast.  the way it is reported it almost seems to say You shouldn't allow them to take the breast. The decision has to be made so quickly that it is really hard to weigh it properly.  I don't know what th answer should be.  But I wish we had taken extreme action and not just the partial mastectamy.    I debated on answering you because you and you alone can make the decision on what you should do and my situation is extreme and prejudicial.  Whatever decision you make, I pray you live to be 100 years old. ",

Wednesday she comes home from work and sleeps for several hours.  She will probably do the same thing tonight, and maybe tomorrow.  Saturday she was feeling fine and Sunday she barely had any fatigue at all.  Her regimen is 2 weeks on and one week off (to let her body regroup I think.)   Her concern is that she is handling it fairly well except for constipation and maybe that means it isn't a strong enough treatment.  I've seen mention on this board of several women who didn't tolerate it well so I have no answers but it seems like the SE are a case by case thing.   What do I tell her when she says she expected to feel worse, besides be glad?

First time for about 5 hours and even had a couple visitors. I've mostly kept people away. She doesn't know how to go Half throttle... Never has. After being up and out of bed for so long she crashed hard for about 2 hours. So the next time I nagged her after 2 hours. I'll be happy to get her home and get her back to health so we can take that ride to the beach",

They need to believe that they are going to be ok.  ",
