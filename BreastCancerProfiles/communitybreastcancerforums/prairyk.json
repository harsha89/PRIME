I had a lumphectomy and sentinel lymph node removal (forgive me\u2014I don't know the jargon and acronyms yet) Aug. 30 and had to go back for re-incision to remove more cancer cells and tissue Sept. 6. Since the second surgery, my arm had been extremely sore and sensitive. I thought at first because I had so much adhesive from the dressing I could not get removed. My arm stuck to my body! But after working on that, the pain persisted. At the same time, the numbness I had been feeling was dissipating. Finally yesterday I was told it was because of the lymph node removal, to start with\u2014but that usually starts 2-3 weeks after surgery. However, because the doctor had to re-incise, the tissue was all disturbed and angry; thus the earlier pain. It is normal, the nurse said. HOWEVER\u2014and I don't want to scare you\u2014please monitor it closely. Now I'm having redness around the incision, pressure (swelling) and seepage and I'm going back to see my doctor this afternoon. This latter is probably a totally different problem\u2014but just want to tell you this so you can watch out. AND be assured the arm thing is normal. Good luck!",
