Also had blood tests for antineuronal antibodies and that came back normal, so i'm still no closer to a diagnosis. The next step, is to see a neurologist again, from Southampton.  He comes to the island once a month, the specialist here is going to write to him, hopefully on Monday.  I'm hoping he will ask to see me in Southampton, as he isnt due back here until 15th February.

I saw my general doc again today, we are now looking at the posibility that I  may have Sudecks Atrophy, which, if it is, would mean I may have cancer back.  I am going to have a bone scan, and see what that shows, if nothing shows, I will have a body mri. If it isnt that, it is some type of motor disorder, and my doc is saying, that mets would be the most treatable of the 2 options. I will keep you informed.   I am apparently, top of the list for discussion at the specialists weekly meeting tomorrow. hugs to all Maxine",

The report says the following: There is a subtle area of apparent increased signal in the central and ventral pons seen best on the T2W TSE and FLAIR images.  Appearences in the pons seem to centre on the region of the medial lemniscus and more inferiorly over a wider area including the corticospinal tract - this appearance is of uncertain significance ? related to the patient's symptoms.  A neurological opinion is advised regarding further management. Well.....no one seems to know quite what is going on........so im back ..waiting to be referred yet again..... meanwhile, ive lost most of my reflexes, hands are becoming more spasticated...and feet are deteriorating too.... anyone have any idea at all what any of these means? hugs max",
