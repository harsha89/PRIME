You do not mention whether your insurance is willing to pay for some of the costs. Call them and ask. Some insurance plans cover it. If so, your doctors can prescribe and give a referral for LE garments/therapy costs. Moreover, see if they can get you a discount pricing for your garments.  If you injured your knee you would have therapy, right?! Right! I can emphasize with your financials--(so wish I had Aflac). Cancer did not ask what your obligations were. It is daunting. You CAN manage the LE at this stage. Yes, it can be problematic for your two jobs (two jobs--you are superwoman!) and assisting your mother.

My right breast had no detectable cancer (mammogram, pet). Biopsy of the dense tissue was benign. Removal was to lessen bc reoccurrence from 5% to 0.5%. My surgeon  and I discussed my swelling under my right arm prior to and after menses. He did not think it was lymph nodes but breast tissue. In the surgery, two spots (comic relief here) of Stage 0 cancer were found in the skin tissue of near my areola. \"Deep tissue surgery\" was performed under my right arm. So 17 nodes, all cancer free, were removed. Done. In reading your experiences of LE with fewer nodes removed, I have anxiety of a high probability that LE can present in my left arm too. It weighs on me. The constant pain, worry, depression draws away from my healing process. I know I have to get a picture of health in my head so my body will follow. But, at times, I want to chop it off. So, yes I am very pushy when I meet dismissal. Presently, I am interested in the testing the surgeons do for VLNT and lymph by-pass surgery. Please know, I am not writing to advocate or discourage anyone on these surgical procedures. My simple thinking is that the pre-evaluation it has useful application to determining whether LE will become present after surgery and can be a tool for treatment. Right now, a patient only has a surgeons high hoped words, which we all found worthless.  Here is what I understand. First, the doctors check to see which vessels/nodes are \"working\" and which are primary/secondary for removing fluids from the limbs. The procedure appears to be simple: inject a special ink dye into the webs of the finger/toes then 2 to 4 hour monitoring under a scan to see how the dye moves in the patient's lymph vessels. Rather than the wait and see protocol we received, l can see how the evaluation can be implemented to address patient's real concern.  If this was done prior to surgery, more definitive answer to \"will I get LE\" could be made. The surgeon would be able to know which vessels/nodes are crucial and perform micro procedures to retain the highest amount possible.  After surgery, another test to identify which  lymph channels are working. I think it would help focus the type and extent of LE therapy needed. This type of testing has been around for twenty years. A surgeon in France has used it in her procedures. Again, I am not advocating or denouncing the procedures. I would like to have this test done. I just need to find who will do it. I know my questions, if answered will improve my recovery. I hope it can help more. r.e.",

I agree it is a mostly ignored subject by the present medical industry. Le suffers in invisible corners, hidden under wraps and bandages, hiding from light. It is not sexy. It is debilitating, limiting. Personally I wonder how long I will be able to keep my employment health care if this comtinues. I found tons of articles about remedial surgerical options in one area, scrotum/penal LE. I know there are major differences between le induced by cancer surgery. My point is that it is just a fallacy that the medical establishment has not taken time to study the lymphatic system. In the US, it doesn't seem that the establishment has not broaden its focus. LE cases in this selective area have been documented, repeated and followed for years. I found a very graphic study on www.scielo.br/ (Sorry for not posting true link-it.could be censored.) It is time to get that pinpoint light to open to all other areas of primary and secondary LE. Please do what you can to give this disease a full spotlight not a cameo.",

I have to live with me rash decision making. This is a very important time in your journey. A clear head and calm mind is important to you. Surround yourself with a care team. Research your options before committing to them. It is not wrong to ask for a second opinion, third opinion. You will be left with the decisions taken to your body, not your doctors. Please take time to review everything presented by your treatment center team and feel empowered to question their expertise.  Write down questions and bring those questions to your consults. Be sure to ask about complications from treatments and alternatives to the treatments being offered. I say these things with hindsight that I sped through my process to become cancer free. I am now looking down the horrible path of lymphedema and watching commercials for class action suits on my chemo therapy drug (a less damaging alternative drug was available, but, I did not ask. I did not know).  It is a very scary thing to have be diagnosed. But, remember you do have time to make decisions. One powerful tool is to ask what quality of life you can expect after submitting to the referred treatments. You will have life after treatment. The question is important. How it is answered will guide you on whether the surgeons and oncologists are interested in treating the cancer or treating you. It is not the same. Cancer can be surgically removed, blasted with radiation, dosed with chemo and plied with pills. You are not cancer. You are a wonder, a vibrant person with dreams and goals. Make sure your treatment center knows those goals and know also that you are not to be separated from those goals. If I could go back the few short months, I would demand the surgeon to perform test on my lymphatic system to identify the primary nodes draining the sites of my cancer. Then demand node sparing at all cost. If you are heading to surgery, if they tell you \"standard treatment procedure dictates (whatever),\" let them know you are not standard and do not expect standardization. I am over the hair loss, the scars, the chemo but I am never going to be over the lymphedema. So, I know my wording is harsh, but my hope is that you do not have to face this terrible inflicted disease. My prayers will include you.  ",

Find a cancer team that is right for you. One that understands your goals. I think if you focus on your goals and have a care team that will help you achieve those, it will relieve a significant portion of your anixiety. Get stats on your center's efficacy with your cancer type. Ask.about recovery, treatment pallative, curative, diet. Mediation, positive imagery, prayers have VALUE. They provide focus and clarity. If you belive you are on the right course, let no one dissuade you. All the same, let another expert in on your vision for yourself.through a second, (third) opinion. You won't buy a car just because it is the nearest car lot, even if the salesperson is sensitive. Why do it with your life? Please take time to review your options. There is time. Cancer is slow. Understanding of what is out there helps relieve the big fear of \"am I doing the right thing.\" In additon to recording your consults, bring a caregiver(s) with you to your consults. That person(s) does not have to be medical trained only aware of what your goals are and who you are outside of cancer. It can be overwhelming at times. Sometimes you won't hear things. Your care taker can keep you on focus. It is journey not a race. I pray for you, r.e. ",
