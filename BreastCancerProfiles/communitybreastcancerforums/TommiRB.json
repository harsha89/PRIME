      "Content": "TommiRB wrote: Hello all, I was on these boards a long long time ago when Dx with BC Stage 2 in August 2011. After 8 rounds of aggresive chemo and 6 years of Arimidex, I figured I was doing well and celebrated 10 years of survivorship on 8/15/11.  Unfortunately some spots were found on my spine during an MRI for a herniated disc...ortho had me revisit onco, and spots on spine were fine, but the ones on pelvis were worrisome. After the bone biopsy (oy - was that a charm) - I found out on 9/12/11 that I was now Stage IV with bone mets. Less than a month after a MAJOR celebration, the beast is back. I currently get a monthly shot of Xgeva and daily Aromasin. Between the 2, I have some major pain in hip and knees..It's a lot tougher going through this at 55 instead off 44 when first Dx. So we have added pain meds for me to be able to function with quality. There is no true prognosis for any of us in this situation - so I just want to have a good quality of whatever time I have left - hopefully after every year or two, there will be more to help those of us with mets. Just wanted to say hi again and I know I can come here for support and hopefully to help others as well as we all continue to fight this!!! Shine on everyone!!

I am very productive in the morning, even if I wake up at 4am. By the afternoon, I'm a goner - napping on my sofa for about 2 hours. I do take a 5mg of valium some nights, but most of the time I just keep it very cool in the house and a glass of water on my nightstand. I would most likely be a \"poster\" if there was a \"Can't Sleep\" forum. Good luck and I agree that a change in medication schedule may help - it certainly can't hurt. Good Luck!! Tommi",

My onco told me to take a VitD/Calcium supplement daily, so I take a Viactiv (chewable chocolate) or Vitafusion (gummy chewable). Would prefer the chewables with all the meds I have to swallow - especially the ones for the bone pain due to the Aromasin/Xgeva comb. Finallly retrieved my password for this today...was 10 years clean on 8/15/11 and dx of bone mets 9/12/11...what a roller coaster.. Good luck to all!!!",

I know I was devastated when my onco. of 10 years retired..thankfully the new Dr. in the office he referred me to was the type of onco. I wanted - I like the \"straight to the point\" type. I am a \"wiz\" at researching doctors and medical facilities, so if there is anything I can do to help please to not hesitate to send me a message. Hugs!! Tommi",
