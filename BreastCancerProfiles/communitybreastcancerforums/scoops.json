I had a breast reduction in 2006 and have scar tissue in that area. She did say she thought it was scar tissue BUT she also said \"this is what BC feels like!\" I'm waiting for a call so I can get a mammogram. Could it really be scar tissue? I wish they would call with an appt! Help Log in to post a reply",
