I now have the ultrasound report which says \"If there are definite lumps they should be considered solid as ultrasound is best at identifying cysts rather than solid lesions.\"  I know thickening is not a definite lump but is it considered solid?",

Fast forward to yesterday when I saw a surgeon who does a lot of breast surgery.  He told me I had fibrocystic changes which were causing the pain.  When I asked him why the right side now seemed asymmetrical with extra creases near the armpit where the thickening is (for lack of a better description), he said it fell within the 10-15% range of normal variance.  Then he said the symptoms should resolve when I enter menopause at age 50 (I'm 41 now).  I reminded him I'm post-menopausal already, to which he said it must be hormonal and that was not his department.  Recent hormone blood tests were ok. I've never had any problems with my breasts prior to this and always thought post-menopausal changes were treated as more suspicious until proven otherwise.  Am I mistaken?  Dr specifically said \"no surgery needed\" due to low risk of cancer.  Should I ask for a second opinion referral (which has to come from GP here in Ontario)?  I don't want to seem like I'm doctor shopping but what I heard today confused me.  Log in to post a reply",
