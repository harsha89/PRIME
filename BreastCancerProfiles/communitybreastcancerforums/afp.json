I just finished my fourth week of radiation and yes, it's becoming a very draining process! I often remind myself that it's not as hard as chemo was and try to remind myself how far I've come! Does anyone experience people in your life kind-of \"forgetting\" that you're still in treatment even though chemo is over. I find it frustrating sometimes because even though I'm looking healthier on the outside, I'm still tired and definitely not myself. So thankful for all the women who are walking this path and \"understand\". We are strong, amazing and resilient!",
