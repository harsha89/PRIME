I follow this thread because I do find you all to be so inspiring and motivating! If I had a fitbit, I would like to join your group. I want to continue to move and work out but much as I like to be active, I've never liked to workout for the sake of workout i.e. I hate the fitness club and my home treadmill. That said, I too feel better and sleep better when I move during the day so I keep trying to find ways to do it. I'm a bit frustrated with the lack of snow here in lower Michigan - I haven't yet been able to get out my skis yet and only have been able to use my snow shoes once! On the upside, the lack of ice has made hiking possible so I'm trying to keep doing it. I usually manage 2-3 miles. I also have a yoga-flow DVD that I use when the weather doesn't cooperate with getting outside. The forecast for today is snow so fingers-crossed! Keep on, keeping on!",

I've done the stairway many times and it never ceases to amaze me how it can seem effortless on some days and nearly impossible other days. Yesterday it was nearly impossible! Today, I forced myself out on to my cross-country skis even though I still felt pretty tired and a little sore from yesterday. I plowed through it but did not feel as invigorated by the movement or the scenery as yesterday - it was also very cloudy so maybe that contributed.

What I did want to drop in is about the blood work. Since it sounds like it is a long drive for you to get to your medical center, perhaps you can inquire about doing the blood work onsite same-day. I have done Taxol twice for a total of about 6-8 months and every time I did the blood about an hour and a half before the chemo infusion but always on the same day at the same medical center. They can get results quickly if they want to. Alternatively, perhaps there is a local medical center at which you could have the blood drawn and the take the results with you when you go for chemo. These are pretty straight forward blood tests - as far as I know - so they should make some effort to make it more convenient for you. You shouldn't miss out on a good treatment option because the driving was too much when there are likely accommodations they could make for you. All that said, I have also found Taxol to be quite manageable. Of course, we are all different so we have different reactions to the same drugs but it wasn't nearly as bad as I feared and it did knock the cancer back both times. Best wishes to you. Margarita",

I also get Zometa with Kadcyla - usually once every 4 months or so. The two medications are intended to work together for bone mets. I have also experienced some aches and pains from Zometa but for me, it usually only lasts for a few days. Have you told your oncologist about the pains you are having? I guess you have since he or she has offered an alternative. I am not familiar with Pamidronate but I would not avoid an alternative just because of the 3 hour infusion time. I know it's no fun to spend so much time in the infusion chair but if you will suffer less in the days following, it may be worth it. I take an iPad and headphones and watch movies during infusions. It helps pass the time and it's peaceful to tune out the surroundings. I believe there is also a Zometa thread on these boards somewhere. Perhaps others there have had similar experience to yours.

I'm mostly stable (NED-yay) except for one spot on my spine (L-2 boo!) which had shown no hyper-metabolic activity for nearly 2 years butis now described as \u201cintensely hyper-metabolic\" - which sounds kind of bad to me (major boo!). It is the likely culprit of my recent back pain though the pain also feels wider spread to me than just one met on one vertebrae. Frankly, I was expecting a worse result but hoping for a better one. Can one met flare on one vertebrae really cause an ache across my entire lower back? Anyway, this same spot was active in my PET of Feb 2016 but has been inactive since then. So, my MO is recommending radiation and then continuing with TDM-1 afterwards to see if we can control this one stubborn met and keep this otherwise good run on this drug going. It seems like a good plan to me because I was worried about blowing through another line of treatment but I will have to temporarily suspend TDM-1 infusions during rads. Anyone else have a similar experience? Hope you all are doing well and feeling good.",

I asked my MO about it a few weeks ago and she said she'd look into it. Today, she told me that although she hadn't heard of it prior, she was interested enough in the drug's early findings that she is now trying to establish the hospital/clinic as a trial site for the phase 3 trial they expect to open in July 2018. I was really impressed that a tip from this group passed on to my MO led her to research and then apply for a clinical trial. So good to keep sharing information. Maybe we'll have yet another good drugoption down the road. In other news, I'll be proceeding with SBRT radiation to my spine in hopes that we can push back the one misbehaving met and continue on with Kadcyla since it is otherwise keeping thingunder control.

There are, of course, some common side effects that several of us have to varying degrees such as drippy or bloody nose, a little fatigue and maybe a bit of neuropathy but then, I guess most of us land here after a fair number of prior treatments as well so who really knows how much fatigue, for example, is the result of Kadcyla and how much is cumulative strain on our bodies from all other treatments? I have found Kadcyla to be a very manageable and effective treatment. I've lost count of how many cycles I've had but it has been about a year and a half and things are still looking pretty good. I just described my recent progression in my last post aimed at Escorpion but aside from hopefully stopping the spinal progression (which has been the stubborn lesion knocking me off previous treatments) my MO wanted the SBRT in order to prolong my time on Kadcyla for as long as possible. That said, our eyes are also on DS-8201 which has been termed a \u201csuper Kadcyla\" and is looking very promising in trials for those of us who eventually progress on Kadcyla. Hopefully, you too will find this treatment both manageable and effective! M",

I feel the same as it has been a very manageable and effective treatment for me too. Several months ago I also had a rise in my tumor markers which, unfortunately, was correlated to progression in bones. But, as the scans showed only one active bone lesion, I was able to get that spot zapped with SBRT and then stay on Kadcyla. I just had my 6-month scan post-SBRT and the bone lesion is still quiet so I'm still on Kadcyla. I wanted to mention this to you because even if your scans come back showing progression, which hopefully they won't, but if they do, you may still be able to extend your time on Kadcyla. We all hate to hear it but when your onco says \u201cwait and see,\u201d that's really all we can do. Ugh! Hoping for the best for you! Please keep us posted. Kaption, I haven\u2019t myself experienced a dosage reduction but nor have I experienced such fatigue.

You've gotten some great and informed input to which I cannot add much and the trial sounds like a very good option. But I just wanted to mention that if Taxol becomes the best option at some point - now or down the road - perhaps you should ask your doc about Abraxane. As I understand it, it is Taxol with a different delivery method - it isn't dissolved in a solution so it is supposed to be easier to tolerate. It might be good for Dani since side effects seem to be so hard on her body. Abraxane also doesn't generally require the pre-meds that are also sometimes hard to tolerate. I've had both Taxol and Abraxane and the Abraxane was easier but alsohas been deemed as effective, if not more so, for metastatic breast cancer. By the way, from all I've lurked and seen on these boards, I can see that you are an amazing mom! I wish you and Dani all the best!",

For the entire time that I've been on Kadcyla - about 10 months now, they have been elevated but with a range of ALT 36-59 and AST 43-53. Prior to going on Kadcyla going all the way back another year they were pretty much always in the 20-30s range but even before Kadcyla, I had a few outliers where the ALT spiked to 58 for no apparent reason. My MO has said that these number are considered fairly slight elevations and she wouldn't really worry about them unless they shot up \"significantly and/or suddenly\". So, based on my experience, I'd say your numbers are pretty much in the range of acceptable. On a different matter, I wonder if any of you Kadcyla ladies have experienced either thyroid nodules and/or capillaritis? I am in the process of undergoing various tests - so far ultrasound and in another week or so, guided needle aspiration biopsy -- of thyroid nodules that suddenly lit up on my last PET scan. I am not terribly worried because other than the thyroid (which was not a prior metastatic site) there was no evidence of metabolic activity on my PET. And the say that breast cancer mets to the thyroid is very rare (never mind that every diagnosis I've had thus far has been \"rare\" - not to worry!) but curious whether this could be related to Kadcyla. The capillaritis is strange - it's a skin condition where tiny blood vessels (capillaries) burst right at the skin surface creating a sort of reddish pin-prick polka-dot pattern. No pain, no itch and no explanation as to why I suddenly had these things appear on my torso but they've stuck around for several weeks. It is not listed as a \"known\" side-effet of Kadcyla so just wonder if anyone else has experienced it. Much as I want to believe that they are \"nothing to worry about\" as the dermatologist says, I find any change in my body to be concerning at this point and I expect there to be reasons for anything that does change. I'm not very happy with a response of \"well, this happens to some people, we don't know why but it's nothing to be concerned about.\" I just hope they are right! Otherwise, everything continues to be good on Kadcyla! lol",

That said, I don't think it is unusual to have a more pronounced reaction after the first time a new drug is administered. I think Kaption is correct that dizziness, especially if it persists, should be reported to your doc. Also, it's generally not wrong to keep be sure you stay hydrated. My medical center still has me wait a half hour after infusion before I leave as allergic type reactions are not unheard of even among people who have been on the drug for a long time. Bigpeaches, welcome to this Kadcyla thread. Of course, everybody reacts to drugs differently but I have found it to be a fairly easy protocol. Kadcyla is sometimes referred to as a \u201csuper-Herceptin\" because it uses the same pathway as Herceptin but delivers a powerful chemo directly to the HER2 over-expressing cells. Well, I'm no scientist so maybe I'm all wrong about how it works 😆 but it seems to work well for many of us and it seems that it is becoming quite commonly prescribed after progression on Herceptin and Perjeta alone.

Is that accurate? My MO has always said not to worry because there are still many tools in our toolbox but I've never pushed her to name what will come next if/when I fail Kadcyla. Have been hoping not to need to discuss it any time soon but will definitely ask about this drug. Btw, I am happy to report that my recethyroid biopsy came back benign. Hooray for small things.",

That's just fantastic!! All, and especially those new to this drug/thread: I'm also doing well. Not sure yet that I'm NED again but about to go for my 39th Kadcyla infusion. Over the two years I've been on this drug, I've felt pretty good and had fairly minimal and manageable side effects. I've had two minor progressions one in my L2 spine and one in my psoas muscle. Both we're treated with SBRT so that I could remain on Kadcyla since it seems to be working for the rest of my body. So far, after nearly one year post-SBRT, my spine shows no sign of disease though due to radiation related changes, this was not so easy to ascertain. I'm told there was lots of re-reading of my scan results before my team arrived at this conclusion so I'm sure hope they are right! The psoas muscle outcome will not be known until my next scan next month since I only just finished that radiation treatment. My fingers are crossed for a complete resolution even though the RO said that the treatment was not viewed as curative. My preferred state of mind is denial so I'm always and still hoping for a cure but I'd be thrilled with NED for now. I just received the results of my genetic testing. This is going to challenge my little chemo-brain to even begin to understand. It's interesting though. Hang in there ladies and hope Kadcyla works well for you too! I think someone was concerned about their liver and/or kidney function numbers. Myliver function numbers go up and down. My MO says she doesn't worry about them unless they are elevated to the point of about triple \u201cnormal\" range but my kidney function hasn\u2019t changed while on this drug. Margarita",

I've just had my second Kadcyla infusion. Well, this is my second time starting it. Had it earlier in the year but was taken off due to possible lung progression. Did a few months on Taxol and then the progression was ruled out. Of course, glad it was determined that my lungs actually were clear (I just had inflammation) but it was a bummer to be on Taxol again. Lost my hair - again. But worse, I got a fair amount of neuropathy in my hands and feet. Not so much painful as just the uncomfortable feeling of numbness. So, my question to you lovelies is whether, based on your experiences, I can expect improvement of neuropathic symptoms on Kadcyla or does it aggravate it? Incidentally, I am also required to wait 30 minutes after infusion in case of allergic reaction - after the first one it was 90 minutes! Thanks!",

I've been using it and it seems to help with the dryness though I still drink a ton of water at night too. Also been using the Ayr for sinuses and it also helps. I had a terrible cold during the early part of this month but seem to be mostly over it now so back to the \"usual\" dry nose. Also, I just wanted to share that my PET scan results from last week showed no metabolic activity anywhere! This after nearly two years of various treatments - Taxol HP, just Herceptin/Perjeta (progression), Kadcyla (suspected progression), Taxol HP again, back to Kadcyla for past couple of months. We can get there! I hope it will stay that way for a good long time because aside from a few pesky SEs, I find Kadcyla to be quite manageable. At the same time, my heart functioning (efficiency) has degraded a bit and blood pressure has been high so now also on Lisinopril and going for regular echos. Sigh, it's always something but still I'm grateful Pasque, my hair is growing back but it seems to be at a snail's pace fortunately I live in a cold climate so I can just wear a hat everywhere I go.

I had two PET scans in 8 months last year that were clear -also showing no signs of active disease. Then in December my PET was all clear but for one bone met that flared back up. It's a site that has flared before so in January we did SBRT to that one met (lumbar vertebrae) and I've continued on with Kadcyla. Our strategy was to keep with what has been working systemically for as long as possible and try to kill off for good the misbehaving met. Won't have another scan for a few months now so just hoping that it worked",

As ADDK asked, I was also wondering if they are giving you an anti-nausea pre-med? I used to be given compazene as a pre-med but I found myself to be so irritable and fatigued after my infusions that I decided to skip it once and see how it went. I've not taken a pre-med since because I feel better without them though they did offer to switch to a different one if I wanted but I don't get significant nausea from Kadcyla. Perhaps if you get premeds they could tinker with those and see if different ones would work better for you. Also, I try to take in lots of fluids before, during and after each infusion so perhaps that helps. And, I have made an effort to up my probiotic intake in order to decrease drug induced gastro-intestinal issues - I think it helps. I haven't noticed a metallic taste with this drug but I remember it well from other chemos - I just tried to eat my way through it. :) I'm sorry, I'm not sure this is helpful especially since we all respond so differently to these drugs but thought I'd share my strategies in case it might be useful.
