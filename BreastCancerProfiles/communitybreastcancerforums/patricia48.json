I used to have a good sense of humor, but it gets lost a lot now. Maybe it got hit by a giant chemo pellet.   I still feel like the wig is  just sitting up there on top my head. I have no sense of it being an extension of me.   At least it is cool here, due to rain.  Yeah!  I walked in a light shower this morning and it felt wonderful. Good luck to all  of you having treatment today. I am so glad for those that are ending chemo.  It seems like a long way off for me.  My next is Thursday coming, my first of 12 weekly taxols.  So I am trying to enjoy this week between.  I love all the swimming stories.  Fotopet and Irishtess - wish I could bare it like you guys, but I have a few years on you and everything was not in the right places, even before the surgery. Ha.  The point is, we are  beautiful and strong women and we can feel proud.  Swimming would feel wonderful.  I need a suit that works with my foob.  I have not felt like searching yet.  There are no stores in my small college town, and when I go for treatment, I am too tired to think of it after  .LibraryJenn, enjoy a movie and free time. Mothering is a very demanding job.   I just saw Knight and Day.  It was about the best movie in our theater right now, with some laughter, which we all need.  Sacphotomom I hope your rash goes away. What else can happen,  Geeeesh!  I also hope your dad is better soon, and I am so glad you called and got some good information. That makes all the difference.  Hope you all have a decent weekend and remember to find some laughter!   ",

She could see the lymph node involvement too, which for me was really threatening.    Anyway, for anyone I missed, keep in touch and know you are all part of my prayers. ",

About an hour later there was a knock on the door and in faltering english/french, hotel staff asked to come in.  I quickly covered my sweetie who was sleeping on the bed, and let her in.  She checked the minibar and I asked her how to work the air conditioner.  She said I would have to call the front desk.  I decided to wait, since we had the windows open.  In a few minutes there was another knock.  The front desk had been informed that our air was not working.  I hesitate, but let him in.  He quickly remedies the problem and leaves.  By that time, I am wide awake and sit down on the bed. It is only then that  I notice my image in the mirrored wardrobe across the room, and start to laugh hysterically.  I am wigless,  left boobless, and a big sticker on  my new sweater is running across my left chest, declaring it is \"Small\".  At that moment I though I may never show my face at the front desk, although it is necessary to walk by it in order to leave our room.  Ha.  What a start to the week.   I missed you all so much and I am so thankful that you are in my life.  Hugs,  Patricia ",

I did more passive and assisted poses, but the stretches  immediately begin to help with the range of motion and the numbness.  I sill have some numbness in the arm pit, where 12 nodes were removed.  It itches a lot and massaging and stretching help tremendously.  Just ease into it gradually.  I allowed my body to tell me how much stretch to do and I just always made sure I allowed for a gradual stretch.  Everyday I could tell a difference.  Great that you got on the treadmill.  Walking is the best compliment to yoga. My oncologist said, every day walk 30 minutes.

One day at a time, I know. It is wonderful to be a part of this group.  Having  the support is wonderful,",

My clothes look normal, but more important, the weight feels normal.  For walking, around the house, etc, I wear my camisole, which is very lop sided, due to my MB(mature breasts) but it is comfortable.  Yesterday, I bought Dr. Brommers pure castile citris orange soap and love to scrub head to toes with it.  I think castile soap is very gentle and we need that now.  Take care and be gentle with yourself.  This too will end, and we must think of the future and all the things we want for our life, family, etc.  My yard is so overgrown. Yikes.  I love to walk out back as it is wooded, even though I live \"in town\", a small college town.  I too am too tired for gardening, my energy comes and goes like a freight  train blowing through town.   Best wishes and hugs to all. ",

When he called back I told him it was a hair raising conversation   He said that he and my daughter would shave their heads in solidarity, and I laughed and said do you know how likely your 25 y old sister, who takes 2 hours to get ready to go to the grocery, is to shave her head?   Not before  buying a closet full of wigs anyway.  We both had a chuckle about that, but hey, they are both great kids.   Tomorrow is my onc appt, blood work, and if all goes well, my second a/c chemo. It will be a long day.  I am praying to avoid the 8 hours of acute nausea I experienced with my first session.  Do any of you eat differently  on the day before or chemo day?  I am eating well, but already pretty bland, since I have a lot of nausea and indigestion.  I have given up coffee my favorite vice ( Loved the Starbucks story sacphotomom) and that has helped.  Anything acidic is a killer for me.  Anyway I  wondered if anyone had any suggestions on how to have a better experience on chemo day.  Thanks for all the support.  I love reading everything that is happening. Irishtess, what a story about our  \"Mature breasts\", as Iprefer to think of them.  Remember that Matisse painted some very beautiful Mature Breasts. ( in the future referenced as MB) So there is nothing wrong with a beautifully dropped breast.  Perky is not everything!   What we all have experienced here in chemo/universe.  A book of \"dark chemo humor\" may be appropriate.  Good news from my world: My significant other is driving down tonight from 110 miles away to be with me again for chemo.  He is so devoted, and such a great nurturer.  I am in good hands.  Also,one of my dear friends showed up at my door today, vacuum in hand and announce that my cleaning woman had arrived.  She spent 4 hours cleaning my house, and sitting with me to talk. I am so blessed to have supportive friends and family, the best.  Wishing everyone SE  free days and the easiest chemo sessions.  Tricia, thanks for sharing the evidence of how these drugs are working.  In all my reading, I have heard how important it is for all of us to  also remember, that it is our own bodies that are working to heal us.  Chemo is a very very powerful helper, but in the end, it is our own  body   that make it all work, and we must believe in it's strength and ability  to heal these \"misinformed, confused, irreverent cells.  Love to all, Patricia",

I laughed till I cried.  Find your favorite humor, and go for it.  It was very, very therapeutic! x-ray girl -  I like Louise Hay too.  She has one CD called Cancer, discovering your healing power. She is a cancer survivor too.   I use this cd as well as one by Kanta Bosniak called Surviving Cancer, a sacred journey.  Kanta is also a cancer survivor.  Anyway, I use them almost daily, to help me visualize a cancer free future.  They are available at Amazon, if anyone is interested.   Tuffy(my wig) is great, but I love my baseball caps and my daughter just returned from Hawaii with two hats for me. One is by  Roxy, and it is so comfy.  Tuffy only comes out on special occasions.   golfer girl and fotopet- my best friend just completed radiation, and it is correct that they do not want you to loose any weight during rads because of the markers changing.  She did not have to have chemo, but she had 35 rads.  She learned of her cancer, 2 months before mine.  sacphotomom  I hope your dad continues to improve.  Day-  I drink Nettle tea too.  It has so many healing properties.  I also have been using fennel tea for tummy settling, also mint tea.  I have a tea for everything.  Ha.  I also have the bladder leakage problem, on certain days(wish I had a tea for that), but I am not sure what the connection is.  It is not a fun thing. Leanna, loved the chemo pellet comment.  I get so tired of taking pills for everything...Another good tea for constipation is Smooth Move.  It is effective and not  harsh.  Maybe you know about it too. For those wanting to make positive diet changes, s great book about cancer fighting foods(like asparagus) is Beating Cancer With Nutrition. I have been following it since dx. I have a food Vitamix blender and when my tummy can tolerate it, I drink dense with veggies and fruits.  I have very little sugar, except honey,and  natural fruits.  I like R W Knudsen Spritzer drinks, has a little carbonation, and fruit juices.  You can get these at the health food store.   I am dreading the weight gain with the steroids and taxol.  I lost weight on A/C, but worked to gain it back because my onc was upset. He felt it was a bad trend and I was at a  very good weight to start with. I had just lost 15 lbs at weight watchers before my dx.   I get my readings at every visit and my onc talks with me about them.  That is how I learned I needed the transfusion.  I get copies of this lab work.  Sometimes I have to ask for the copy. I am still walking and doing yoga.  I get up early before the 100 degree temps here that just melt me. I love reading everything you guys write.   I say a prayer for each of you daily, and hope that we all  claim our right to full health, and peace, and the happiness that comes from knowing what each day is worth!     ",

I feel more myself with the weight of it, and my clothes look more like they used to.  This is a big boost!   I think the storm has passed outside.  I wish it had passed inside.

I guess if you have cancer, there is no need to fear these. Leanna OMG what a terrible experience with medical mishaps. I am so sorry.  One of the nursed dropped an open  needle packet on the floor with me while accessing my port and I said you are not planning to use that?  She said, no just waiting to drop it in the trash.  I was not entirely sure she would have.  Yikes!  Anyway regarding feeling better after AC, it was the second week for me and the best days were about 12-14, in spite of the drop in my white blood count.  I know this is not good news, but I did have a lot of feelings of the styrofoam in my tummy.  I cried a lot, because I just wanted to feel \"normal\".  I hope this gets better for you soon. My first A/C was the worst, so maybe that will be true for you too.  I will pray for you.  And regarding your Kitchen remodel, YOU GO GIRL. Life is short, and you deserve it!  It will be an incentive to cook healthy and enjoy your time in the kitchen..  Daiva  I am so proud of you for  walking. Keep it up!  I have not missed a day for many weeks now, even the rain feels good.  I am so glad you got the time in CAL with your DH! My Sweetie and I bought new walking shoes. What a boost.  Mine were old, and I  needed more cushioning.  He is getting a rescued golden retriever to walk with us.  Hope we can keep up! Laura, We missed you, glad you had a break.  The blisters sound terrible. I am getting a break out on my face, not fun at age 62.  Seems to be across the nose and under my eyes.  Can there be anything else?  I am sure there can be, I should shut up and be thankful.  Kim  Necessity is the mother of invention.  You are a smart lady.  Hope this makes your wigs more comfortable.  I want another wig if I am going to be hairless for long.  I got my scarf from Lux France.  It is beautiful, a pink paisley, and fits so well.  I love it.  Well I need to sign off and watch tv, or some other mindless activity.  Besos y Abrazos (hugs and kisses) to you all. ",

Tomorrow I will go for my 8th (of 12) weekly taxol and I think the dreaded transfusion will be on Friday.My last tx  should be Sept. 30th.  I have felt so tired this week that I am almost looking forward to the transfusion  at this point.  It is funny how your perspective on all this can change. And yes, my spirits are back to normal, crazy, perky self! Irishtess My sister already told me I look like Elizabeth the first!  So there is nothing to fear.  I think I look like little Orphan Annie in my wig, with no eyebrows. It gives me that surprised look all the time.Ha. Hope everyone is strong, staying tough, and keeping the faith that we are long term survivors and thrivers.  We have a lot to offer the world and the world has a lot to give us!  Hugs and lots of love, Patricia ",

They seem so random sometimes.   Golfer Girl and X-ray girl I am glad you found the info about cd's helpful.  I have liked both of these.  Not only do they create images of healing, but they are very relaxing as well.  I use them almost daily. Redbarb, thanks for the info about the mesh  underarmor hats.  I will check this out. I am so happy for all of you finishing chemo!  I call it the Chemo Lounge.  It will be a place I will be happy to put behind me.  I do feel lots of appreciation for the staff and the fact that this treatment exists and can help our bodies to heal themselves, yet I do dread weekly tx for three more months, plus rads.   I know I have to gear myself up for this, as well as radiation.  Sometimes I just get down and find it hard to see how to keep this up.  I know we all feel this from time to time, and yet we do find our strength, and carry on.  Hope your Saturday is going well and everyone is able to appreciate the day!",

I think for me my most spiritual path is to be present for every moment, and cancer has certainly enhanced my desire and ability to do this.   Library Jenn, glad you got The Cancer Fighting Kitchen.  I have favorites I will share next time.   My yoga zonked me out and I cannot think clearly right now.  Also the information in that book is so worth it.  Just add a few new foods/recipes each week and before you know it, you will be eating healthier.  The cucumber/avocado soup was good yesterday, because it was cold.  I think next time I will decrease the lime juice, and add a few of my other  favorite herbs. I will let you know how that goes.  ",

This week, I learned my hemoglobin is down to 8.3, so I will have a transfusion this coming thursday.  I am okay with that. I feel so tired, that I am ready for one.  Yikes!  The good news is that I continued my walking.  I also started an antidepressant, and I am crying a lot less.Yeah!!!!!  I only have 5 more taxol to go, then my glow in the dark routine.  Yeah Kim for the funny thoughts about that. Sacphotomom Thanks for all your kind words. It helped me a lot to know that I sometimes help others feel more positive.  You are an inspiration for me.  I love your sense of humor and your ability to express all your thoughts.  Paxton and Wellsey, thanks to both of you for letting me know I make a difference to you, and thanks for all the support. Paxton, I hope you are  feeling better by now. Kim  I pray work is going okay for you and that you are able to rest enough.  The radiation does make you tired.  My friend who just completed it was so very tired.  Leanna  Hang in there.  Number three was better for me and number four as well.  It is so tough, and I know how much you need the support of all your friends.   I think it is impossible for people to realize how long this goes on and how very tired we all are.  It is such an exhausting mental ordeal, not to mention the physical aspects of it.  Like KIm, sometimes it feels like a year long bad dream. Irishtess, Day, Summer and Daiva, I miss you all and loved reading your posts.    I am ending this on an up note  and promise to keep in touch through thick and thin.  My sweetie and I am going to Paris for a week between my chemo and radiation,  in October!  We have reservations and I am so very excited to get a little break, instead of waiting until December.  My onc thinks it is great, and I am going to do everything I can to feel like going. That means getting my blood counts up, and keep  up the walking and yoga. May warriors,  I know I missed some of you, but it is hard to catch up, so please forgive me and know that each and everyone are in my thoughts and prayers and we truly are an amazing group of women! Love and hugs to your all.  Patricia",

I have kept up with you all  by email on my phone, but my achey pain has kept me off the computer.  I am also developing my first signs of numbness in my feet and hands, and  my digestive issues are back. Joy Joy!!!   Stacey - you are welcome here.  Thanks for catching us up on your treatment, etc.  I am so glad you found us.  We are a great group of women and you will find a lot of support here. Leanna  You are so awesome!  I think your friends are missing such a wonderful opportunity to spend time with you and support you.  My friends are older, and better understand chronic pain and illness.  When we are younger, we just have  no idea what this kind of treatment is like.  I know my adult children are that way.  I just think that they have a hard time seeing me struggle, and it is easier for them to go on with their \"life\" as usual. Part of me is happy they do not know the details. Anyway, thanks for all your hugs and support.  I am sending you love and energy for your next treatment.   Sacphotomom I laughed till I cried when I read your Freudian slip of BS instead of BC.  You are so much fun.  I always Christmas shop on my trips too, and I have nothing this year, so I do know what you mean about feeling behind.  I hate the malls and crowds. I like to get small gifts from museum shops, galleries, etc.  Also, I love the salt too! I just do not dare have anything in the house that is a salty treat.  Pacjen Your anniversary celebration sounds beautiful.Congratulations to you and sacphotomom on your anniversaries. Daiva  How neat about the t-shirts. It is exciting that you are getting so close to the last chemo.  I am so happy for everyone who is finishing and I pray that each of you You are right about this journey, and how we have all come a long way.  Thanks for the reminder to check in with some of the newer groups. You are a wise woman! Paxton I am sorry you have to wait on test results.  I think that is the hardest part for me. I am praying for everything to be clear, and I wish you could just be finished with chemo.  About eating healthy, it is a process of making better choices and there is nothing wrong with an occasional sweet.  I find most things are too sweet, and only a taste is enough for me.  You have been doing great to make the changes in your diet and you will continue to do well.  I am so proud of you for getting rid of the head gear.  It is a pain.  My sister said I looked like the first queen elizabeth due to no eyelashes and eyebrows.  She said  I looked regal.  I think I look like an alien.  Ha.   Drim  did you feel okay on your trip to PR?  I have felt so bad this week that I hope I am not being overly optimistic about going to Paris in October.  I think I just feel so weak because of my hemoglobin.  I hope I bounce back after the transfusion.  How are the rads going? Irishtess  Your trip to Ireland sounds great.  I love to read your posts.  You are so thoughtful   Day Thanks for sharing your art with us.  You are awesome. I miss your folk wisdom and hope you will be writing more soon.  Can't wait to see pictures of your hair.  I have felt too bad to worry about mine. Nothing seems to be happening on my head or elsewhere.  It is nice not to shave my legs or pull chin hair! KIm  I hope work is going okay and the heat is not to bad for you.  I look forward to your humor and miss you. Hugs and prayers for everyone of you, and anyone I missed. I pray for all of us daily, that we will heal and bring more love and wisdom to those we touch along the way.I know you all have done that for me.   Patricia",

I am retired, so I am pretty available.   Irishtess, the sleeve sounds cool.  I am ignorant about needing one on the plane.  My onc has always told me I am not a likely candidate to have problems, even though I had 12 nodes removed, 8 being positive.  Regarding the yoga poses(plank, etc), I have had no problems, but my instructor always does a lot of lymphatic massage before.  Anyway thanks for the info and I will ask my onc next week about my plane trip..  This thursday is my last chemo! Yeah.  Latte Is that your daughter in the pic?  She is adorable.  My prayers are with you all.  LibraryJenn and Paxton I hope you are both okay.  Hugs to your sweet babies!   Good night my brave warrior sisters.  Patricia",

You are so right about positive thinking.  Yesterday, I was reflecting on the Have or Had Cancer issue and I realized that I rarely think about it anymore.  It is amazing, in spite of the fact that I still have rads ahead of me, but my daily thoughts are no longer on cancer. I think I have replaced those thoughts gradually and was not aware this had happened. Laura  Thanks for sharing your friends story.  Her idea about not thinking of being a cancer survivor really resonated with me.  My lashes and eyebrows are gone, and I have found that I can run the mascara brush over the few brows that are left and some of the white hair there will color in.  Most of the hair on my head is white, but I actually like it.  I embraced my grey hair about 5 years ago at age 57.  I stopped coloring and found I did not miss the work of keeping it colored.  Also, I found that as you get older, the lighter color suits the complexion.  But you guys are too young for all that.  Denise, I am so ready to say hello to 2011 with you.  BTW  My son shared with me yesterday that I have another grandchild on the way, in May, and my Sweetie's son is having his first child in April or May, so we have two little bundles on the way.  This will be his first, and my second.  So we will be shopping for bebes in Paris.  Ha!  My GD is only 11 months old, so they will have their hands full.   Jersey I am praying for you and your Full House.  What a change for you.  I am praying that your mom is able to regain some of her independence, and that you will find ways to get the rest and time for yourself that you need. Wishing everyone a good day, and I am so grateful for our sisterhood!  Patricia",

We leave on Friday afternoon.  Paxton, I am glad you are thinking \"had\"  also I agree about saying \"my cancer\", from the beginning I have rejected the very thought that this is \"mine\".  I hope you are continuing to make progress with healthy eating. It is hard some days for all of us.  I have found that some of the chain stores (Marshall's, TJ Max) if you have them, carries some healthy sugar free (with agave or rice sweetner, not artificial sweetners ) cookies and snacks.  They also sell agave sweetner, which is what I use when honey creates too much of it's own flavor.  They are much more affordable than the health food store as they buy close out items.   I will have some sweets in Paris, (pasteries and my favorite Pot de Creme).  I just make a choice that it is worth it to have a special treat (when it comes to processed sugars). Leanna,I will be back before your surgery, but know that I pray for you daily and I hope your mom's visit  is not too stressful.   I found my mom could not help much with my daughter  when she visited, as she was so focused on her own health by that time.  It did help to give her specific tasks, and remind her that would help me so much.  I wish I could help each and every one of you with your kids.  Beer,  yes, I can now have half a beer without ill effects.  I love beer, but I just cannot have much.  The same for wine.  I must have wine in France(I love french wine) but I cannot tolerate much without falling asleep.  That is not very romantic!  Magda, yeah for the tumor shrinking!  Hang in there and keep your thoughts positive. I may not write again for a while.  I am going to to my Sweetie's house this afternoon, and we will leave from there for the airport on Friday. Hugs to all, and you are in my prayers! Patricia  ",

I expect it to look \"irregular\" since I only have a small portion left from a surgery 30 years ago.  But they are consulting my surgeon today, and will call me with the plan.  I have missed you all so much and reading your posts makes me homesick for all of you.  My hair is sprouting, but not nearly so much as some of you.  It is so white that it does not show up near the front of the crown.  Still I love it, and prefer it to the wig.  It is beginning to feel natural, and this week I walked without a head cover. It felt great! I will try to take a new pic soon.    Hugs to each of you.  Patricia",

Glad you are still walking!  Yesterday I saw the specialist about my thyroid. He ordered lab work on my parathyroid, and will do a biopsy of the part of my thyroid I have left. in Dec. He thinks it might be a parathyroid problem, since parathyroid malfunction has been found to link to breast cancer, and both my siblings have had parathyroid issues.  So,  there are more tests and possible surgery in my immediate future. Yet  I am keeping a positive attitude about it.  I am not ruling the trip out at this point. Magda, your gypsy story was so interesting. BTW  I saw lots of gypsies in Paris, but none tried to tell my fortune.They did try to sell us a gold (?) ring Day, So sorry about your friend, how are you doing?  Latte how is your recovery from surgery coming along?  Talk to you all later, and don't  forgot you are strong and awesome women!

I have to say that BC has taught us some of the same.  My armpit has been tighter since rads, than the entire time, but yoga and gentle stretching is helping with that.  I think it is the standard for BC follow-up not to test for any other mets, unless there are symptoms.

Most of you already know who are on facebook, but let me know if you want to be my FB friend.  I just had my second clear Mammo since treatment.  All seems well.  I am having physical therapy for frozen shoulders, which is somewhat related to the radiation/medication/surgery.    I hope you are all well, happy and living your life to the fullest.",

Laura - thanks for the tip about buffwraps.    sacphotomom - I know what you mean about the nightmares.  This week I dreamed the entire trunk of my body was made of a big block of styrofoam, and I could not feel myself. I was trying to get through doors, and into bed, but it was too big and bulky.   This is how I feel about my body now.  It seems like it is pretend, and nothing works, and I cannot relate to it.  The fake boob, the big scar, the bald head, the drugs I have to take just to make things work....  Sometimes I feel like a science fiction experiment!   I feel like my wig is a  big cat sitting on top my head! Kim and Judy - I too, do not know how to scratch my head without moving the whole thing around.  I think I will give my wig a cat name.  My first cat was Tuffy.  Hey, he was grey and black.  So Tuffy it is!   It is  a great wig, and very much like my own hair(salt and pepper), but it feels like a foreign object, and it is so very very hot!  Paxton -  my thought are with you today. It is so normal to dread our treatments!  I so admire that you have been through this before and that you  have courage to move forward again.  We are all very courageous women.  Don't forget that everyone!  In my two week cycle, I have about 3 day where I feel better, then I start the whole thing again.  After this one, I start Taxol, and of course, like the rest of you,  I dread the change.  I will have weekly low dose Taxol for 12 weeks.  The drive (70 miles round trip) for this and daily radiation will be a challenge.  Mostly  I worry most about the reactions to Taxol  that seem so extreme.   I guess I am now used to A/C and know what to expect.  This process seems to go on and on.   I have not every started thinking about radiation (35 for me).  This seems so unreal at times.  I will end on a positive note.  I am still walking daily, doing yoga, and enjoying my children and granddaughter.  She is crawling now and likes to climb into my drum table and scatter books everywhere!   Her favorite book is one about Monet.  I like to think she will enjoy art, like her Mimi.  My son says she just like the way it tastes!  Best wishes  and love to all.  Thanks for being here for me.   It is a lonely journey, and I am so glad we have each other.    ",

X-ray Girl  Regarding being cautions around people, I have stayed at home during my low blood count days the entire time and I have not had any illness.  I also ask people who are coming over if they have any symptoms  at all, and wear my mask around people (repairmen, etc.) that I do not know.  I just know I can not handle any other illness in addition to treatment.   So please consider skipping work this week.   I do not know how to count the days now, since I am on weekly Taxol, but I know there is still a dip in wbc. My onc says it is still 10-14 days after, so there will  two cycles going on at the same time, which will be confusing.  I  can tell by the shortness of breath and fatigue.  I think I will be just continue to be careful all the time..   Is anyone else having their steroid decreased with each weekly infusion of Taxol?  I am nervous about this.  I will be off the steroid(which is good, as long as there is no reaction) by week 4.   The nurse at the chemo lounge seemed skeptical about this, but I do trust my onc.     Hope we all are having better days soon.  ",

My suggestion is to try the recipes that have ingredients that you like. It will inspire you to cook and be most likely to please your taste buds! I hope everyone has easy treatments this week, and for those who are finished,  Yeah!!!!  I love to hear from everyone, and miss you all when you are off line for a while, but I certainly understand that our energy just does not allow it sometimes. ",

Xraygirl-I have a nurse outfit that I bought when my Sweetie had surgery.  We loved it.  Not TMI for me.  Ha.  Also I have studied American Tribal Belly Dance for 5 years and was in two different dance troupes.   I highly recommend it.  It is a very woman focused way to get in touch with you body, and by the way quiet a workout.  But you can start slow.  It does wonders for the toning and shaping the  body.  The first Simonton book is Getting Well Again.  I can't remember the second, but both are good. Leanna yes, let's encourage biking.  It is to be 95% here today.  I walked earlier, and maybe early evening biking will be how I work it in.  My BF likes to bike, but he is so much faster than me that it is not a lot of fun for him to go with me.  We do have a small bike trail in my town, but it is safe to ride most all of the town, and I always wear a helmet. Pacjen and NJbhwgirl Casting for recovery sounds great.  I also would not want to share a bed with someone, but anything that gets us away from all this is great I think.  I have been trying to visualize what I will do to celebrate completion of my treatment, which after the rads will be the end of November.   Maybe a trip.  I am going to Thailand, Vienam, China and Cambodia  in Jan with my sister(This was planned for over 10 months ago, before my diagnosis),but I want some down time with my BF first. .  I am trying allowing myself to visualize what would feel like a healing celebration with my boyfriend John, but since dx, I have trouble with visualization of such things.  That is why I am working with the Simonton books.    Sacphoto mom I hope you are moving out of the pain and slump and feel like doing more.We all get down with this, and it would be crazy if we didn't.  Paxton, don't forget to find time for yourself, for the meditation CD.  It can make all the difference! I hope you are getting some much needed help.  I am getting into the cooking.  I did a great imitation of Julia Child as I prepared veggie filled omlets for myself and my BF yesterday morning.  He was so pleased, and I made them eaisly, thanks to watching the old episodes I ordered.  Julia makes me laugh because she never needed to be perfect, she just loved to cook. I like role models like her! I am praying for all of you, and I am so blessed to have all of you in my life!  ",

I have the 3-5 day achey body that seems to be the worst part of the taxol for me.  My arms and feet feel so heavy.  Leanna, to answer your question about A/C, for me the gastro stuff was hard  and it seemed to always be there. The thing that scared me the most was the shortness of breath that came about day 9-11 in my two week cycle. Now I know it was the low red blood count.  I was functional throughout the cycle, being able to walk almost every day.  I did take nausea drugs to combat the upsets, and eating or drinking anything was difficult on a lot of days.   Daiva_- I considered going to Simonton and even talked with them on the phone, but the timing was not right.  I decided I could create the elements of their program myself, and save a lot of money.  I will use that money for my trip after I finish treatment.  BTW, I was a Swimmer's Mom for 15 years and sat though some hot meets. I don't think I could do it right now.   Day  I know what you mean about your BS.  My onc has a national reputation for his work with breast cancer, and I feel so lucky to be in his care.  He is an older man, and very calm and focused.  I am glad you were able to have company, and that you will soon be finished with your treatment.  Good luck tomorrow!  It never gets easy. I am nervous each time, and especially when I changed meds. I hope everyone is having a good Sunday. I am alone and just resting, due to the achey pains.  Yoga helps with this too.  My Sweetie returned to his home to mow grass, etc, so he can be back with me for treatment.  He is really an awesome partner.  Thank you all for being here for me.  It  helps so very much to dialog as we do, and know that I am not alone with this.  Hugs and Prayers to all.  PS  I got a box of hats from Heavenly Hats.  Check them out on the web, if you have not yet.  ",

I love that he does not delegate this to his spouse, but calls and has asked a lot of questions about BC.  He has really stepped up and given me support.  Paxton  I am so glad you are walking.  Let your emotions flow, and when you can, do the visualizations.  I continue to pray for all of us, but especially for you young mothers. LibraryJenn, that includes you of course.  I pray that all of you will heal and be able to be there for your children as they grow up.  Children never quit needing their mother.  My son wrote a card to me about three years ago (he is 39) that say something to the effect that mothers can fulfill  the role of many people in our lives, but no one can replace our mother.  It was very meaningful  at that time because we both had recently started  new relationships, after being very close and seeing each other everyday for about 5 years.

To all of you who are working, returning to work It is important to ask yourself it this is what you want to be doing.  I retired 5 years ago, luckily I could, but I have never looked back and I am so glad that I followed my heart.  We do not owe anyone the time we need to live our lives and follow our bliss.  We know better than they do that time is finite.    This is getting way to long and I need to take my walk.  Sorry for all those I missed.  All of you are in my thought and prayers.  Thursday is number 10 of 12 for me, and my monthly onc appt.  I smile when I think of my May sisters!  Patricia",

Anyway, all my life I wanted a baby grand, and this one helps me realized that my playing has been very limited by the poor quality of the piano I had. (lost it in the divorce, no room). So I am not sorry about this recent f... cancer decision. The piano is very beautiful, but most of all the quality of tones it produces makes me want to learn more and more.  Tess, loved your story about the guitar teacher. Leanna, it is never to late to learn music as an adult, easier, actually.  Since my sweetie is learning classical guitar, we plan to play together and learn together.   Leanna,  About regaining your strength after surgery.  I had  a modified radical  of my left breast  and 12 lympth nodes removed, and through yoga and weights that I carry as I walk, I regained my strength (but  not all my sensation) in that side of my body.  I can do plank, and yoga moves that require the same  body support by my hands, but I am having to increase the time gradually.  I love rock climbing( although  I am an amature) , so I want that strength to return as well.  I have full confidence you can get back to your push up.  No lymphodema isssues for me with my exercise.  So you can do it girl!  I do not know how the reconstruction will effect your progress, but stretching those underarm muscles is very important.  Mine are nearly equal in length now to the other side.  Paxton, so good to hear from you.  We all have those lower butt and vj  and UTI issues.  Hell fire if they are not a pain!  I have to fissues from a 10 lb  4 oz baby delivered vaginally, so I get it Leanna.  anyway Paxton , we are all rooting and praying for your strength to return, and to begin to hear from you.  That boy of yours deserves to have a healthy mom who is full of energy for  life.  I want that so much for you and all the mothers.  Daiva, I want a mani and pedi, but my nails are all loose half way down and I am sure I will loose most of them.  I feel like taping them on so I do not jerk them off.  Anyone figured a solution to this.  Mostly, I fear infection in the nail bed, and wow, I already have carpal tunnel from playing that new piano.  Wish I could send a pic, but I cannot seem to work this site to add a pic.  Latte, I know what you mean about reading the possible effects of some of the things we go through.  With the transfusion I had, they now list HIV, liver failure, rejection and instant death.  Wow.  So glad I only had to have one, and I refuse to worry about the future of that decision.  Magda, I loved hearing more about your live and job, etc.  Latte, tell us about living in Israel.  I am a real travel nut, and want to see the world before I die.  So I have three trips planned, Paris, the one to Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia Singapore, Hong Kong (with my sister) and another with my honey for a month in San Miguel  Mexico in April.  We stayed a month last year and loved it. Since we are both photographers, we love traveling and seeing the world through  our cameras. Sacphotomom  hope you are okay and look forward to hearing from you.  Summer hope your cold is better. NJ girl, hope some of your pain is resolving. My white blood count was 1.7 this week and I am trying to avoid every risk for infection.  Just one more week!  Sorry this is so long and hope to catch up with everyone I missed next time.  I am just a little hyper as you have guessed.   Hugs and a dream to met you all face to face in the future!  Patricia",

That is why I did not opt for reconstruction... If I had been thinking more clearly at the time, I would have opted for a double.  Crazy reason, because I know that would not have prevented a reoccurance.  It is just that I hate my prothesis, and would prefer to be flat chested and not have to worrry about all the \"fixins\" that have to go into looking \"natural\" Does anyone else feel that way?  I do not like the way I look in my \"lounge wear\" and certainly do not want to lounge around in any kind of bra. LOL.... Only Lilly (my dog) sees me and she does not care, but it somehow makes me feel bad to see one side sagging and then if the door bell rings, I have to run for a bra or a loose robe.  Even if it is 100 degrees.  and don't get me started on traveling with a prothesis and  a sleeve .  About half way through the flight, I want to jerk them both off and runn down the aisle saying free at last from the torture of binding garments....... LOL My age probably effects how I feel , but I just do not see my breasts as part of my femine identity anymore.   Healthy is the way I want to see myself at this point, and comfortable.... I just want to feel comfortable. There is not other place I can say this I guess, because I know we have all thought about these issues.   I have been on an antidepressant Citolipram since diagnosis, and am considering discontinuing it, but things keep happening up that make me think I should wait.  I also have a prn for Xanax, and I use it occasionally, when I am very anxious, just to head off patterns of anxiety. Having been a therapist, I have no issues with the use of these meds. Anyway, I am ranting and rambling, so I will go.  Take care everyone, and I continue send healthy vipes and prayers out for all of you.",

Keep up the meditation and know we are all praying for you to feel better.  Daiva  By the way, my onc said Simonton is a \"very well respected program\".  He said there are a lot of shysters out there.  I was surprised to hear him say this.

I am retired, so I am pretty available.   Irishtess, the sleeve sounds cool.  I am ignorant about needing one on the plane.  My onc has always told me I am not a likely candidate to have problems, even though I had 12 nodes removed, 8 being positive.  Regarding the yoga poses(plank, etc), I have had no problems, but my instructor always does a lot of lymphatic massage before.  Anyway thanks for the info and I will ask my onc next week about my plane trip..  This thursday is my last chemo! Yeah.  Latte Is that your daughter in the pic?  She is adorable.  My prayers are with you all.  LibraryJenn and Paxton I hope you are both okay.  Hugs to your sweet babies!   Good night my brave warrior sisters.  Patricia",

Anyway I will talk more about that later.  I felt great on the trip and my burns healed pretty quickly. I missed you and cannot wait to catch up with you all.  Patricia ",

I know it must be so hard to wait. I hope you get a definitive answer soon so you can move on. I know I wou,d be a nervous wreck, with or without meds. If you have any relaxation tapes, try to use them. I found that helped me as much as anything. I have thought of removal of the second breast. I think it would have been covered by insurance at that time, but I doubt it now. It is so hard to think of the future when you are fighting for your life. And in all reality, our health is the most important factor, the rest is just aggervations. I guess I just needed to vent a little with people that would understand. I bet you are excited about that new grand baby . My granddaughters are to light of my life, them and my dog Lilly! Take care Kim and I will continue to send you light and love.",

Their party sounds like so much fun, as do your vacations! I hope you all have lots of fun! It is great the girls get to spend time with their aunties! My sister does not have grandchildren, so she loves to come spend time with mine, and of course my daughter loves being an aunt to them as well! This month we are going to fix me a sisters room at my house for sleepovers! They are only one and two and a half, but they love to come to Mimi's house Lol Denise and Jen, thanks for sharing about your decisions about double mastectcomies. I guess we all second guess some of the decisions we had to make at such a trying time. Kim, I like the aw you are thinking. I think it is always best to think positive, and only deal with what you know right now! I other wonder how anything, including us, would survive what we went through with chemo, rads, surgeries..... But we are strong women and we know how to fight! We are changed in ways that it is hard for others to understand. Sometimes I dislike all the \"little\" discomforts the most, like the lymphodemia, prostheses, aches and pains..... They all add up to aggravation! It is always great to hear from all of you.... I will always wonder about all of us, praying we are all okay. Kim, prayers continuing to go out for you. Keep us informed! Jen, good luck with the court reporting, that is what my siste did for many years, then went to law school at age fifty. Lol.",
