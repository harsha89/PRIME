    "Content": "VeenagoyalInd wrote: hi, I underwent Lumpectomy ( lump removal - breast saving surgery) on 1st April. My drain and stitches were removed on 26th Apr ( Drain was approx. 100 ml per day, with last three drains around 40ML and then shooting upto to 80 ml again). I had the culture done of the secretion from my drain pipe, and it seems there is some pus formation. My doctor has put me on antibiotics - 1200 mg per day ( first time since surgery) for 7 days started on 3rd May 2013. I am noticing redness around the incision for last couple of days. I am afraid if it is because of seroma or any other problem. Please suggest, if you have observed similar redness post surgery and what shall i do. My surgeon says it is normal..dont worry much Log in to post a reply",
