Did not have my films. They are being mailed. Also I spoke to my obgyn after the mammo and she said she was not in the office and didn't see results yet. She will see them on tues when she returns to office. I dd however find out that my radiology report stated that my breasts were dense and right one is more dense. No mention of lumps masses etc. but I am still category 0 and states needs prior films. I read that asymetrical breasts are worrisome. What if my breasts weren't dense before and grew more dense? Also the tech wanted a second pic of my right breast. I am worried that maybe I have abnormal density Help. :( Log in to post a reply",

It just said prior films needed. Didn't say additional tests required. Sorry not trying to dispute u just hoping for the best. Thank you so much",
