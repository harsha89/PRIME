I can still feel this abnormal lymph node and also now I got a swollen lymph node just above my elbow and I don't know if that is related to the breasts, I wasn't told to come back and because I'm 36 they sad year ago that I have very little change of getting BC...so I'm a little afraid of going back because they made me feel like a hypochondriac when I insisted on MRI last year but they let me have it and the only thing that was found was enlarged lymph nodes on my right side and they said it was probably some virus and would get ok but nothing has changed. One more thing is this cyst never changes size when I have my period is that normal, I'm little bit worried because my health hasn't been good this last year, I have little appetite also and have lost 44 lbs since last year when all this started..I Tried to talk to my Gp about it few months ago and he just looked at me like I was imaging things..

My surgeon called to day and said that they want to have an MRI of the breast because they think all these changes are suspicious...now I'll have to wait for the hospital to call with the MRI appointment...he said he hoped that I could get a time before christmas but if not than in January ...I told him that it would be really nice if I could get a appointment sooner than later because it's so hard to wait all this time...and also because my breast seems to keep on changing... Things can sometime take such a long time to happen but I'm happy though that they are going to do this though I'll have to wait some time more.... I'll let you know when I will get the appointment ...Its so nice to have you all here to talk to..... I send you all my best wishes too Lisa... ",

Two months ago I found a lump in my rt breast, I went to the doctor and had a mammogram and US and they told me it was just big lobules and with that I went home but I wasn't happy with that answer so off I went to my dr again and again they looked at my breast with mammogram and US and this time they told me it was a cyst and they did aspirate it and I thought that was it and went home... But my breast kept on changing and it got more perky and changed shape and I could feel a lot of thickening also there was a dimple which kept getting bigger..then few days later I found a enlarged lymph node in my armpit and they asked me to come back..they looked at it with a US and the doctor told me it looked benign but she saw another one that looked suspicious and she took a fine needle example of it which was benign...so she asked me to see a breast surgeon and he could feel the thickening and saw the dimples and told me he was going to look at my pictures and talk with the other doctor and get back to me with in two weeks... I also got it seems a lymphedema in my right arm, it's swollen all the time and gets worse when I use the arm a lot... Now I'm just waiting and it's so hard....I've been so tired these last weeks...and these past few days I've been having nausea and dizzines and to day I started my period but I shouldn't start until after two weeks ....I have always had regular period just like a clock ...Iam 35 yrs old. I just don't understand what is going on with my body...and it's so hard to have to wait so long ...have any of you felt like this before you where diagnosed..you know irregular period and this feeling like you are sick or something? I'm not a American...I live in Iceland so my english isn't perfect but I hope it's understandable ...  Log in to post a reply",

Thank you Beverly11 for sharing that with me, I'm pretty sure that all of these symptoms are related .. The BS told me that he thought that it would be best to do a biopsy...he talked about that it would be probably best to do a surgery where he would take a part of the thickening out or to do a core needle biopsy... and he was going to call me later after he has looked at my mammogram pictures and then he will decide which method he will use... But it's so hard to wait as all of you know... Which biopsy method do you think is better?  Lisa I'm so happy for you that it was benign ...and thank you for all of your good thoughts... I know the women here are so nice and wonderful to talk to... I did write my first thread in the ILC forum and the ladys there were so wonderful to me, I just wasn't sure if it would be right to write there again because I haven't been diagnosed..   ",

I'm sure there is something going on in my breast all the lymph nodes around my right breast are swollen and there is more thickening right under the skin...my period was just ending so my breast shouldn't be swollen or the lymph nodes ...I admit that I'm scared and feel a little bit helpless because of all this waiting time...I've been thinking if I should call the receptionist at the BS office and leave a message for him to tell him that I seem to have gotten worse over these past few days but I'm a little bit afraid to do it....because I have had to push so to have them do the biopsy ... But of course I shouldn't because this is my health that we are talking about ....it's just so hard to be your own advocate ... ",

I've been really afraid of going to the doctor again because last time they made me feel like I was over reacting but I know I can't do it to my family not taking care of me...I am really afraid I have to admit finding out what is wrong because I've ignored all the signs and symptoms for this long, again thank you all so much for the support.",
