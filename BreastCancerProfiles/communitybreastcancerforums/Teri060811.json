My surgery began at 3pm on a Tuesday and I went home by 1pm on Thursday. I didn't do well with the oxycodone, it made me nauseous. After a couple of days I was only using Aleve. All I used in the hospital was the camisole i bought with drain pockets and a toothbrush, hair brush, and face wash, and a pajama pant outfit that buttoned down the front. Try not to worry too much about it. Everything will be ok eventually. I was surprised at how much I was able to do right away. Sending you lots of hugs!",
