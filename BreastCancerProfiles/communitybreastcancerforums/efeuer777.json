I am ready for this journey to begin on October 1st so that I can begin counting down the weeks to completion. I hope some of you will consider keeping a journal.  I kept a journal eight years ago when I went through this mis-adventure. I was able to write down things that were impossible to verbally share with others.  Use your journal to record what you feel, what foods taste good, the smells you love or hate, what days are the most difficult, and what your hopes and dreams are. Do something special tomorrow on September 30th because everything changes in October. Let's do it!!  Ellie",

Music was mentioned in an earlier post.  Any other ideas?",

I wanted the doctor to perform a double eight years ago but he really didn't want to take the perfectly healthy breast, and the insurance would not pay for the double at the time.  You make the best decision you can based on the best information you have at the time.  I hope all goes well for you!!",

My first cancer was eight years ago.  I will begin Taxotere and carboplatin on October 1st, 6 treatments given every three weeks and Herceptin every week for 18 weeks followed by 34 weeks of Herceptin given every three weeks. The chemo I received eight years ago kicked my rear but I got through it and I have felt great for the last seven years since the treatment ended.  All chemo has lots of side effects but none of us will have all of the possible side effects.  Lets not let the overwhelming amount of information out there scare us.  Good luck to all of us!! . ",

The game lasted until well after mid-night which kept me from worrying about my first chemo treatment today. Today I met with my doctor who answered all my questions, got to sit in a comfy recliner ,was taken care of by competent nurses, and had 5 1/2 hours of TCH infusions while I used my laptop to catch up on work. At the end of the day, I feel woozy-almost like a cheap drunk.  My tastes are a little blurred and I'm tired.  But no nausea. I'm not ready to kick up my heels but I am planning on my 2 mile walk in the morning. I know it will get a little worse each treatment but there are only 5 more of the long day treatments to go. My goals for the next 18 weeks are to do something normal everyday, to appreciate something new every day and to read the breastcancer.org forum every night.  Key word read not monopolize!! I'm already loving everything about these special ladies. Ellie",
