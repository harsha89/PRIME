The nurse has already gone over the after care with me and I have printed instructions. My question is whether I'll feel ok to watch my 4 yr old grandson all day the next day. It involves a 1.5 hr drive up and back. I know I shouldn't pick him up, but he's not into that anyway ðŸ˜Š. In short will I be exhausted? Pain?

I just finished reading all of the previous posts and am sad to read about all of the painful side effects many of you are experiencing. Hang in there! Sure seems there are lots of different ways to deal with skin side effects. I was told to moisturize twice a day and to cover the upper left quadrant of my body, including the side and to use my preferred OTC moisturizer. I had been using Eucerin on the recommendation of my PT (for cording after surgery; she said the ph of Eucerin matches the ph of the skin). I have continued with Eucerin. I've completed 9 of 15 treatments and have little pinking, except my sentinal node incision, which is slightly irritated. I'm about out of Eucerin so may switch to Aquafor which I have on hand. But why mess with success? My cording which had almost totally resolved is now back, but I have some exercises to deal with that, plus the nurse practioner advised taking some advil to deal with the inflammmation. My chest, which has had sunburns over the years, is likely to develop a rash, per the radiation nurse practioner. I've got OTC hydrocortisone cream on standby. No nausea or fatigue so far. I am getting whole breast and the \"boost\" together, for a total of 40 gray over the 15 treatments. My MO said I could have started AI with radiation, but I decided to wait until radiation was done. I think I will be taking Femara and will find out for sure on 11/2. My drive to the breast center is 1 1/4 hr to 1 1/2 hrs so am grateful to have the weekend off. Bet you are too! Mary",

I think I need to rest more, but honestly, I feel good. A bit tender, of course and it's hard to not raise my left arm more than 45 degrees. And my breast does not look too weird. My surgery only lasted 1.5 hrs, which is a good thing 'cause it started about 2 hrs late. The surgeon took two lymph nodes, 1 was the sentinel, the second looked slightly larger than the other nodes. My follow up appt is on June 1st, which is when I'll get the pathology reports. Glad I joined the May club and didn't have to wait til June.",

I'm sending late hugs to Spoonie, and congrats to ccxx for being done with rads. I had my last tx on 10/29 (yesterday)...15 total. I've got a rash on my chest, not where I got tx but from many sunburns. Itching is well controlled with Triamcinolone (prescription) which I'm supposed to use at least for a week after tx ended. During treatment and before, I used Eucerin Original. It's supposed to have same ph as skin. My skin looks great. I thought I'd switch to mygirls, and bought some, but the Eucerin did such a good job, I stuck with it. On to Femara and a bisphosphonate after meeting with med onc this coming Friday. And no fatigue......yet. Hang in there, ladies! Mary",
