I tend to have cysts and I don't usually go in right away.  Usually, they clear up on their own.  I also went from a $500 deductible to $3000. I was not at all prepared for that.   I don't have $3000 and that is what this will cost.  At least.  A friend is going to help me with that.  I hate that a lot but I have to do what I have to do. I didn't have enough time between finding out (Dec. 1) and getting a problem to get up $3000.  I went in April 18.   I just didn't get the help that i needed. I also have several close friends who have had their cancer missed from this same system.  This was different for me therefore, I decided to go to a larger system and a renowned doctor to deal with this.   Celine, thanks for the advice.  I have tried a heating pad and ice pack.  I have not tried wet compresses though.  Heat does better than ice.  As for pot, it is illegal in our state and am afraid of trying that although, I wish I could.",
