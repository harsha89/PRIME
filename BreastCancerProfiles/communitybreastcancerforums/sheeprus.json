I have cording on the left from axilla to the wrist which is quite painful to touch and with some movement. The right side is much better with just some tension in the axilla. I had my first PT session a few days ago with some increased soreness in the left arm even though she was not agressive with mobilization. My question is, what if any specific treatment techniques worked best to help this resolve? And did you develop LE later? Thanks",

It is where cells die in the tumor, I believe, primarily in the center of the tumor, due to such rapid cell growth on the outer areas of the tumor. This deprives the inner cells of blood/nutrients and they die (necrosis). Comedo refers to it resembling a black head like some of us get on our skin. Kind of a simplified explanation, but hope it helps.",
