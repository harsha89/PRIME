      "Content": "Cessairskye wrote: I just need to vent.....  Over the past 3 months or so I noticed a change in the size of my right breast (it was shrinking) as well as the fact that it literally looks and feels like the tissue inside is moving around (I now have a dent on the left side of the breast and a increase of tissue on the right side of the same breast) and the top of my breast itches like the dickens. I give myself breast exams every month or so (I don't have a period due to a hysterectomy so I don't remember every month like I used to) Well this time I felt a small knot in the right side so I went to our doctor. She gave me a breast exam and said she too felt the change in my breast tissue/density as well she felt a small lump in the top of my breast (she said the one I felt had the texture and mobility of a cyst) and wanted to get both looked at with a mamo and ultrasound.  We were talking pretty intently while she was writing my notes and I think I distracted her a bit because she wrote that the lump she felt was at 6 o'clock (which is appropriate for how she was standing while giving the exam) but it was really at 12 o'clock (doctors are human too and they do make mistakes...I understand that).  I go to get the mamo and ultrasound and they kept focusing on the fact that she wrote 6 o'clock I kept telling them I was there I know what she felt and where and that is not where!! When I was trying to show them where (I could only feel it when laying down not standing up) the mamo tech told me that if it was cancerous it would be easily and readily palpable and that if I couldn't find it it wouldn't likely be cancer??? My breast tissue across the top of my breast is so dense they had to do 2 mamos and still couldn't see all the way through (the severe breast density changes are new since my last mamo a few years ago). so they moved on to the ultrasound....they would only examine the side and bottom of my breast. I was given a \"normal\" mammogram result and told to come back in 3 years when i'm 40.  Over the next 2 weeks the same spot in the top of my breast that itched started to get a weird pain that shoots out towards the nipple and the itching and a new tingly/pain sensation is getting worse and spreading up my chest in a line (just right of the sternum) my collar bone lymph nodes are swollen as well as the ones on the right side of my neck so I called my doctor back...I go to the surgeon on Monday. As of this weekend the whole right side of my breast is swelling and getting warmer by the day and I have a pain that radiates into my armpit (deep and it really hurts when I put on deodorant). I have hormone problems and breast cancer is a regularity in my family, I have no sisters and my mom has not had it (and I know the real link is 1st degree relatives) but my grandmother (moms mom) all of her sisters, and both my great grandmother and great aunt had breast cancer. As well as 2 cases within 2 degrees on my fathers side. I know it is probably something easier to deal with than cancer but I am so frustrated and quite scared. Thank you for listening to my ranting!

I was part of the care team for 2 of my grandparents while they battled cancer as well as the primary care giver for my husbands recent battle with colon cancer and some of the things I learned are.... Be your own advocate, no one will speak for you Educate Educate Educate yourself! Doctors do not know everything Remember to take deep breaths :) From what my doctor told me on Friday when I meet with the surgeon (yes he is a breast surgeon) that I am more than likely having a MRI or PET scan this week and posibly biopsy of some type.  Again...THANK YOU! Nice to have such a great group of women gathered in one place :)",
