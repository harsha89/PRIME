At least one expert says it should be a glove and not a gauntlet when you fly http://www.lymphedemablog.com/2015/04/17/lymphedem... And like MinusTwo, I pump my arms and move around the cabin as much as possible. I go to the back and make a fool of myself trying to get as much movement as possible in! As for the itching, try to work up to wearing the sleeve by adding an hour a day. Cornstarch is a great idea - I sprinkle it on sometimes - and I also use a silicone fitting lotion on my elbows, which get dry. This one below, but there must be lots more types out there, and I'd add that this bottle LEAKS, although the solution works wonderfully. https://www.brightlifedirect.com/alps-fitting-loti... Hopefully, people with more experience than I have will chime in, and thanks to all of you for all the advice I've read here! ",

I have my first exploratory appointment with the LVA surgeon next Monday and I'm writing to ask for suggestions. The six points below are the questions I've come up with.

Had VLNT or LVA? Please share here or message me! Microsurgery after breast cancer treatment because I'm not sure who's on which. Thanks so much for any help and suggestions!",

I have to say that when I read the explanation of your pain and how it presents, my first thought was lymphedema. I imagine you've seen a lymphedema specialist - ? If you haven't, ask to be referred to one. Those of us who had lymph nodes removed and then radiation are at great risk for it. The pain my lymphedema causes is deep and intermittent, often shooting, and wearing a compression sleeve helps tremendously. Send me a private message if you want to ask more questions about this. I'm not stage IV but thank all of you who monitor this for us.",
