I took almost a 4-month break from all meds/chemo as two years ago I went to MDAnderson for a second opinion and they said go off everything for several months. I started Abraxane in August and see from your history that you had Abraxane in Nov.2011 and then again in March 2014. Why was there this break? I would also wonder about radiation of T1, but is it close to your spinal cord. I asked about radiating L5 as I have had that met for almost 9 years off and on. She showed me the PET scan and it is not close to my spinal cord, so no need for radiation. All my hormone meds seemed to work for around two years. By the way, Xeloda was my first chemo and it was much easier on my body than Abraxane. Had wine every weekend, had more energy, but then others have a hard time on it. Best of luck on the course you decide on.",

If it shows NED, I also feel I want a normal life and will say no more chemo for awhile as the neuropathy and total fatigue are things I do not want to experience again for awhile. I think back to when I went to MDAnderson two years ago. At that time I had around six active bone mets. They still told my doctor to not start chemo for several months. My next PET scan still showed the six active bone mets but no spread to an organ. One met did have to be radiated at that time as it had grown a bit and was pressing against a nerve. I then started the pill chemo, Xeloda, and after six months I was NED. I stayed on it as I had so few side effects. My next PET scan showed three of the previous six mets woke up. I was told I needed to start a new chemo. I said not for 3 months as I wanted to travel and enjoy some time off from chemo as MDA approved it before. TexasRose said she will always be on chemo, and I recall others saying this. I wonder how our bodies and immune system can handle this for years. I am also so confused as you always read of well known people who have cancer in an organ, have chemo, recover and never have continuing chemo. Is breast cancer different? I believe doctors feel they must keep you on some medication/chemo if you have bone mets. If the cancer spreads to an organ they fear they will have some liability issues. I also know each of us is different so each doctor has to treat each patient the way they feel is the most beneficial...",

I never went off Xeloda for 13 months but was functioning with a good life but feeling like an old lady at times. I fear if the Abraxane puts my bone mets back to sleep she will say gee you need to stay on this chemo UNTIL it stops working. No way. This is week one from chemo last Thursday and I have such fatigue. If like my first infusion, week two and three were much better and I even had a life outside this house. So I get sick thinking of continuing Abraxane month after month so am wondering if you were able to get off it after six cycles. Did you have a PET scan every six months so your doctor could see if you had any changes? Also, a few PET scans ago the radiologist said I could have a met at T-9 but he was not sure and I should have an MRI of that area. My doctor did not think that was necessary and the next PET scan showed nothing in that area, nor had that area ever lite up before. He said it could be arthritis or something like that.
