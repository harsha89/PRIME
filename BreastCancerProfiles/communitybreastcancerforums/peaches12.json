I am a true \"winter\"  person, best in black / white/grays.  My hair was black growing up, started going gray in my 20s and looked frosted for about 10 years and then I colored it brown.  I have skin that looks tan year round and very light eyes.  The brown hair did absolutely nothing for me.  I'm a \"winter\" and the silver hair makes me light up, not look old. Here I am after chemo and going through radiation and people tell me they have never seen me look so good!   Got to be the hair!  Fair skin I can see white hair making one look older.   I love my wig and still intend to wear it a lot after my hair grows in all the way; short just over the ears with bangs, very sleek.  In fact I can comb it with my hands. The hair I always wanted to have!!",

I'm so sorry you are going through all these problems.  But you are strong as we all are!  I don't know if you are familiar with the little Willow Tree angel statues, but my RO's nurse collects them and they sit on her desk for all the patients to see as they walk by.  I wanted to get my radiation tech angels a little gift when I finish (which I guess is now going to next week) and found on Amazon the WTree \"Courage\" angel which she doesn't have.  It is perfect for bc patients and in fact many of the customer reviews mention they were given it when they were diagnosed or have given it to special bc friends.  It is perfect to describe all of us and those who are helping us recover throughout our journey.  That's us, girl- we all have enough \"courage\" to do what we have to do no matter how hard it is.  I have the Courage angel wrapped and ready to take in on my last day to add to her collection. ",

Was deciding to have radiation 'overkill'?  I guess I'll never know, but was afraid to take the chance of not doing it.  I have just finished my first week, so can't speak to side effects yet, but 5 1/2 weeks of radiation can't be worse than 3 1/2 months of chemo.  One of my sons is a doctor, so I am lucky to have not only his opinion in addition to my doctors where I live, but that of the oncologist in his practice also who has seen all my tests and records.  All advised I do the complete double mastectomy, taxotere/carboplatin, Herceptin, and radiation plan.  Again, a very personal decision for all of us, but I felt if I trusted my doctors, and especially my son, I would go with their advice.  The radiation to me is like supplementary insurance and I wouldn't want to regret not doing something that might prevent trouble down the road.   . I met one woman while being fitted for bras after my surgery who scoffed at me for doing chemo much less radiation.  She had chosen to go total homeopathic with only surgery, no chemo/no radiation.  The interesting thing was how defensive and abrasive she was to me.  I in no way judged her decision, asked her to explain her treatment so I could learn more about it, etc., and couldn't have been more pleasant and encouraging to her.  She virtually attacked me verbally that most people thought she was crazy blah, blah, blah, but she knew none of the chemo/radiation would do anything to get rid of her cancer but vitamins would.  I got the feeling she made a decision she was afraid she might regret and had to defend herself to herself, certainly not to me as she was doing.  Wonderful days ahead to you no matter what you decide to do.",

I'm starting my 4th week tomorrow- have finished 15/25 rads.  So far so good!  No rash, no itching, no burning, no blisters, slightly pink in a few spots but as of now this has been a painless experience.  I'm in and out of treatment everyday in less than 15 minutes and the zapping itself is less than 3 minutes.  After reading many many reviews by radiation patients on the net I decided on Miaderm and my RO was pleased.  I purchase it on amazon and yes, though more expensive than drugstore creams, it was developed by oncologists for radiation patients which made up my mind it was worth a try.  From reading on this forum it seems highly successful for those using it and my history so far with it confirms that for me.  I slather it on 3 times a day religiously- at noon in the dressing room immediately after my treatment, between 5-6 pm and bedtime around 10-11.  During my 3rd week, knowing as treatment goes on, burning is more likely to occur, I added Aloe Vera 100% Gel and Calendula between my Miaderm applications as a precaution- mid-afternoon and between dinner and bedtime at the advice of a poster here.  I'd rather over-cream which can't hurt and keep my skin really lubed than not do enough.   I did buy some Aquaphor but found it sooo greasy and thick and I still read of severe burning and severe blisters with it, so I'm sticking with the regime that has worked well for me.  Good luck   We can all get through whatever life throws at us. ",

My lymphedema physical therapist said this is so normal and she doesn't have one post-BC treatment patient who isn't on an anti-anxiety med for awhile until they adjust to the new normal life.  I'm going to get something when I see my MO and may even call her nurse before that. I looked in here the other day and saw the rec for the After Breast Cancer book and have gotten it. Special thanks to whoever recommended it (too lazy today to look back).   I spent a year waiting to get my life back and now realize it's never going to be the same life. One other thing my lymph therapist recommended. The rad area will tighten up several months after rads end and she tells her patients to get a massage ball (looks like that small pimply dog toy, sold in sporting goods shops) and lightly massage the rad area for 5 minutes a day.  Because I had double mastectomy w/ no reconstruction and have no breast to roll the ball on she told me to get a straight little pimply massager with a handle, easier to hold.  She said it works wonders to prevent the skin tightening. I do it for 5 minutes going to bed, so no big deal. Just an idea that might help someone else. ",

My all means wear the leg stockings as long as you need them.  Leg swelling is not anything to fool around with.  You sure don't want blood clots. ",
