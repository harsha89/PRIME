I had my appointment to go over radiation yesterday and he said that he thinks that will work out well. It would give them more time to do the cat scan and plan the radiation. So they are wanting to do the exchange surgery four weeks after chemo and then he said he could start radiation two weeks after the surgery. He said the exchange surgery is a fairly minor surgery and most people feel a lot better afterwards. I was concerned that it could cause damage to the implants, but the plastic surgeon said if there was any damage they could correct it. We shall see what my oncologist thinks about it. I would think she would have the final say.",
