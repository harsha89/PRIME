I've been getting persistent low grade fevers of 99 to 100 off and on over the past few weeks, since just before starting the Taxol and Carboplatin. I've been on broad spectrum antibiotics which seemed to help, but this last week, nothing's helped and it's been accompanied by chills and total exhaustion, meaning that I just want to lay around and get tired from just standing for too long. My white cells were low this past week. My oncologist has been giving me Granix shots and my white cells came up last Friday, and I thought I was getting better over the weekend, but I got another 99 temp and chills tonight. I haven't had chemo for 11 days, so it's not likely the chemo. My white cells should still be up, since they were measured high on Friday. My nose is running and stuffy, but it's been that way for 3 weeks, and doesn't seem to respond to claritin, benadryl, neti pots, or the antibiotics. I don't have symptoms of any other infection. I've tested negative for flu. I was going to get admitted to the hospital when my white counts were low last week, but they came up, and then my PA said that I wouldn't get admitted and my low grade temperatures are not high enough to indicate that I've got an infection. In the meantime, I'm just exhausted, feverish and have chills off and on. Not sure what to do at this point about that. I'm hoping that they can figure this out, and keep my white cells up enough to continue with the chemo next week, because I don't want to miss 2 weeks of treatment.",
