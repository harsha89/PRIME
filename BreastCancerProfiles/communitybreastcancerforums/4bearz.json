I start AC-T on December 16th.  Echo, blood work and port placement on the 14th.  Ready to start so I can get it over with (at least that's what I keep telling myself).   3 1/2 weeks post-op and beginning to feel like somewhat of a normal person (with the exception of the uncomfortable sleeping positioning).  So here's to enjoying this next week and a half before I meet the red devil.  These boards are so helpful for those of us preparing for this phase of our treatment.  Thank you for sharing information! ",
