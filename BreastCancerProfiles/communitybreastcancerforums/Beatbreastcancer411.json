    "Content": "Beatbreastcancer411 wrote: Hi everyone, My name is Uma. I was diagnosed with mets in Jan. '17, two years after having IDC Stage I. My mets are to my lung, rib and liver (only one met to the top of liver). I was started on Xeloda which did nothing for me and then switched to Ibrance which I recently stopped taking due to another progression in my mets. I am now doing precision medicine which is a relatively new concept of taking a sample of my tumor and then seeing which medicines are most effective on it. I was curious if any of you ladies have had any experience with this type of genomic testing/precision medicine or know of anyone who has. Because two medicines have already failed me, I hope the test reveals something promising that can zap my mets away! Wishing you all the best. Log in to post a reply",
