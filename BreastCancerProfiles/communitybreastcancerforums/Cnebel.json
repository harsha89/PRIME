      "Content": "Cnebel wrote: I have a family history of breast cancer on my maternal side. My dad was adopted so I have no history on that side. I saw the lemon picture and it raised some concerns for me. My youngest child will be two in September. I stopped breast feeding almost a year ago. I still have milk at times. What concerns me is that my left breast has a protruding vein below the nipple that goes to nipple. I also have a lot of blue visible veins on breast and chest. I get rashes under my left armpit and under left breast mostly. Lumps can be painful but I drain them and they seem to heal and then come back. I have been googling and researching to try to find a picture of a bad or suspicious breast vein and/or rash. My left breast does get painful at times. Anyone have the protruding vein and take a picture to document it? It may sound weird but I want to see what a bad vs good vein looks like. If you did take a picture would anyone be willing to share it? I just want to see what a bad one looks like. If you have good website I can research that too. Thanks for your input. I also did several rounds of HSG diet which concerns me. My friend works with two nurses who did hsg diet and were diagnosed with bc recently. Their oncologist is linking it to the bc. So naturally I'm not now freaking out Log in to post a reply",
