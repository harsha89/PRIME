They had no problems.  They sprayed some stuff on it and did not even feel the needle!  They told me I could to get some special cream and put it on an hour before coming and slap a bit of saran wrap on it, then I will be good to go.  My surgeon who did my Biopsy and Lumpectomy also did the port.  Other doctors can do it but surgeons really need to because they are the ones to work on your lung should it get nicked (which only happens in rare cases but does since work is so close to lung - my surgeon said he never nicked anyone).  I was fine.  Performed in the hospital- outpatient.  And yes, I was also told can be taken out as just an office procedure.  Good luck to you.  I am sure you will do fine.",
