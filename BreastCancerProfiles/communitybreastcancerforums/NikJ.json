I had 2 areas of DCIS and 1 IDC mass that measured about 2.3. No node involvement so with that my surgeon said I was between stage 1 and 2. It brings you into stage 2 due to the size. I'm almost 6 months out from lumpectomy and I'm doing really well. All I can say is stay positive and you'll get through it. Best wishes.",

I was shocked as I go every year for mammos and was given the all clear with the first 3d mammo I had the year before. Needless to say it's been a whirlwind ever since. I had so many biopsies over the summer then finally had the lumpectomy. I feel like my anxiety is what's taking years off of my life! I felt so much better when the cancer (plus a bunch of benign stuff) was removed, however now I'm freaking out about getting radiation. I'm not proud of it but I am a long term \"light\" smoker and since I was diagnosed I'm having a hard time kicking the habit. Now that I'm starting radiation I'm not only terrified of it being my left breast, but they also warned me about potential lung issues down the road from being a smoker. Luckily they are doing it in the prone position which the onco says will avoid my heart and lungs. I'm still nervous and almost skipped the whole process but I have to listen to my doctors and get better for my family.",

It's been a week since I finished the whole breast and my skin is not worse than it was then. The boosts were no big deal. The one thing that's getting to me is fatigue, but it comes and goes. Hopefully it won't happen while I'm cooking for Thanksgiving. I have decided that I'm not letting this breast cancer situation get the best of me anymore. I drove myself nuts over the last 5 months and my new motto is to stay positive and to move on with my life. Best wishes to you and everyone that's in treatment.",
