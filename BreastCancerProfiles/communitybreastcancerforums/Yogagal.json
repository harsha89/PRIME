I am currently off work because of an unexpected infection that landed me in the hospital Sept 19th. I have cellulitis in my right breast, the doctors are perplexed why I got it so long after my biopsy. I am now at home taking oral antibiotics, this infection is slow to go away and it is delaying my treatment. I took this as a sign from the universe to slow down and take care of myself. Trying to let go of planning around my treatment, and just take it day to day.",

I only have the bandages, no bra until the drain comes out. Not sure why this is the case but I am not moving around much, so it doesn't matter. Today I noticed that my underarm on the lumpectomy/node removal side is very numb. Looking around the surgery boards, this seems normal, but it is not a good feeling.  I am still trying to get used to how small my breasts are now. Not sure how I feel about it. ",

I met with a plastic surgeon this week to talk about a reduction the same time as my lumpectomy. But I didn't prepare well and realized I have a lot of questions I didn't ask. Overall I liked the doctor and he did provide some good information. I am a 34H, so a reduction is something I have always wanted to do, but was afraid of surgery.  Seems like the main risk is the longer surgery, and the risks associated with that. He also explained the risk of not having symmetry after radiation, and the possibility of needing another surgery to correct that in the future.  Tomorrow is my last chemo, so I have about a month before surgery.  Any tips on questions to ask, or thoughts on recovery would be helpful, thanks!",
