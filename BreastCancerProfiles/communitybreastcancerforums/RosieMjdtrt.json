I originally wanted to go with bmx but family members talked me out of it. MRI suggested possibility of micro invasion. Again I wanted bmx, but due to lack of support went with lumpectomy. Just got results yesterday... Clear margins, but 8mm invasive tumor found. Just when you think you're done lol. Now I need to go see an oncologist and wait for the onco type for the tumor. I am 45, er and pr positive but don't know about HER2. Is chemo now a possible part of treatment? I know the lx and bmx would not really change the prognosis, but I am totally regretting my decision to go with just the lumpectomy. I just feel like every test comes back with worse news.

My BS seems to be so against the bmx, not sure why. She did a phenomenal job with my lx though. I am DD so she had plenty to work with. Linda, I am also 8mm but not triple positive. I am surprised they aren't recommending chemo because of the HER2+. I don't know how the rest of you feel, but even though stage 1 is a really great place to be, this testing and waiting really blows. I have such a hard time concentrating at work because all I wanna do is research and learn.",

After my lumpectomy I was told I also have 8mm invasive tumor. So, no longer stage 0 but now Stage1b. Wish I had another vacation planned, because the obsessive thoughts are back and I feel I am back to square one (not knowing treatment plan and now having to go see an oncologist). Hang in there and be prepared for the waiting... It truly seems to be the worst part",

When I was diagnosed with early stage and it was determined no chemo was needed (low onco type score), I had no fear. However, my sister is now suffering from a bit of anxiety. Since my paternal grandmother had it in both breasts and now I have it, she just feels it's a given that she has it. She seems to be obsessing over her breasts and my family is very worried about her",

I originally wanted to go with the bmx but family thought I was being too aggressive. My original diagnosis was DCIS grade 3 but after my lx the pathologist found 8mm invasive tumor. I know my prognosis is excellent so I am not worried there, however, I know radiation really messes up your breast tissue which messes up chances of future reconstruction and also poses other long term issues. My BS did a fantastic job and is really pushing the rads over bmx. Also, with the slight chance of having to add chemo to the mix, will radiation still be required? I am stage 1 grade 3 with DCIS grade 3 and at 45 know there is still plenty of time for a recurrence. I have no problem removing both breasts! Anyone else have similar thouhgts or concerns?
