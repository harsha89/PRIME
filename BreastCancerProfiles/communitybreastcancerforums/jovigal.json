I hope all goes well and side effects are minimal for your first infusions. I get my port placed tomorrow. Exactly 2 weeks post mastectomy. Not looking forward to another surgery but feeling good about getting the ball rolling. I have LVI so I'm very anxious to attack any stray little cells! A little about me...I'm a 42 year old mom to 4 boys ages ranging from 2-12. I work as an adjunct teacher but I'm on a leave of absence. My hobbies are making silver charms, traveling and going to concerts. I'm happy for this site and all the useful info I've been getting from these threads. I've already ordered my ginger drops, b6, biotine and gel socks. Anything else? Sending good vibes to those starting tomorrow.",
