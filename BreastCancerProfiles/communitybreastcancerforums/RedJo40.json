Only good thing from surgery he didn't fill te with as much cc's that's helped. I've been on antibiotics since surgery. So frustrating",

I'm having hyperbaric oxygen chamber therapy everyday until there is good blood flow. My arm is still sore and gets numb every once in awhile. Any recommendations on bras?

It's been two weeks since my emergency surgery for the infection. Monday the drain came out and he took the stitches out and a small filling. Tuesday was my last antibiotic that I put in through my port. Today followed up with infectious disease doctor. Gave me oral antibiotic for 7 days. I noticed another red spot and hoping it's just an irritation and not another infection. Going to see PS to make sure. I don't want to start all over for a third time. Wondering if the flap procedure would have been better. Has anyone been able to sleep on their side? I've been using deodorant and shaving occasionally. Stay strong ladies. We can do this!",

For those with a port you get used to it and it makes getting chemo so much easier. Remember side effects are different for everyone. I learned by trial and error what worked and what didn't. If they give you anti-nausea medicine, take it. I have three doses of my antibiotic left. Then my melanoma surgery 9/5. My PS said I'm healing well and it will be months before I can have final reconstruction. Disappointed I will be smaller, but if I can lose some weight it won't be so bad. I was a 36d before now just hoping to be a full 36c",

I had a vacation planned before the dx, it was to celebrate being done with endometrial cancer tx and full recovery from ACL surgery. I have 3days before surgery and I'm nervous. Met a lady on our hot air ballon ride in Napa who had just finished her year of cancer dx, chemo, rad, and reconstruction. She put my mind at ease and gave me the courage to get through this. I will enjoy the weekend with my family before surgery on Tuesday. We are all strong women and will have a message from our mess. I refuse to let this be what defines me and how I live my life. Praying for everyone as you recovery and have surgery. From one fighting breast cancer to another, we got this. Staying positive in Atlanta. ",

Off pain meds, just taking Tylenol and the muscle relaxer. The needle in the boob before surgery wasn't as bad as the threads I had read. Thank goodness there is no cancer in my lymph nodes and it wasn't invasive, just a large DCIS. As stated before I had chemo and radiation with endometrial cancer and really didn't want to do that again. Meeting with PS tomorrow and hoping the drains come out. I haven't been producing much the last 48 hours. Still taking naps and having family take care of me. Thinking of everyone as we recover and for those getting ready for surgery.",
