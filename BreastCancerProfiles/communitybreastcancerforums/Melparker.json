What they don't tell you is that, at least here in Edmonton, there are no follow up tests done to ensure you are cancer free. In the case of my daughter, she died 16 months aftera diagnosis of stage 1 (it had spread to her lungs and liver.  She was 45 yrs old. PLEASE INSIST ON FREQUENT TESTING AFTER TREATMENT NO MATTER WHAT YOUR DOCTOR SAYS.  Apparently this happens in about 10% of cases and that number is way to high.
