I would just add that the only thing that helped my metallic taste was ginger ale - and it was the only way to keep hydrated although water with a lemon slice was okay. I definitely second biotene for mouthwash. The sites for the wigs - including someone mentioning ebay are a great help - I never did find those sites. I am on to radiation (35 sessions)  and herceptin weekly. Thanks to all for the list !   ",

The chemo itself went in fine - no problems. The neulasta gave me mod. bone pain to say the least and still having it five days later... thank goodness for ginger ale, lemons, tums, compazine, tylenol, and zofran. All needed and taken and appreciated! This from one that hates to take any pill etc all my life and I'm turning 51 on Friday. Thanks for all your support. Got a short hair cut to look like my wig. Not sure why having insomnia last night and tonight?... see my onc tomorrow -",
