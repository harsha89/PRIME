The good news is that from imaging...mri, mamo, ultra sound and biopsy of one small swollen axillarylymph nodes, there are no apparent lymph nodes involved. They will do a sentinel lymph nodes test during surgery which has only a 10 percent chance for it to come out positive, according to the doctors I know The Hr2+ is quiet aggressive and that\u2019s what scares me :( But the doctors are telling me it\u2019s unusually small. All this is very new to me so any feedback is appreciated . Also what probable treatments are coming up for me. I will be having masectomy in two days. Thank you for your kindsupport Greetings from.
