OF COURSE I WORE AN EXTRA LARGE BRA AND VERY LOOSE FITTING CLOTHES.  BUT WAS ABLE TO WORK MY DESK JOB JUST FINE AS LONG AS I DID NOT LIFT ANYTHING, THAT WAS THE MAIN THING. THAT WAS MY LEFT BREAST, THEN LAST SUMMER I HADE A PARTIAL MAST ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND ONCE AGAIN I HAD THE SURGERY ON THURSDAY AND BACK AT WORK ON MONDAY.  I HAD MY RADIATION EACH DAY AT 4 AND WENT DIRECTLY HOME AFTERWARDS.  SO WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY....
