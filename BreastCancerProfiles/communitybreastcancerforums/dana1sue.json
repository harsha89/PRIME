I had breast cancer surgery in May 2010.  Bilateral mastectomy 2 signal lymph nodes on the left and 1 on the right - all negative. On Aug 3 had a root canal on the left lower.  Am still having pain and have decided this is all lymph related.  I have now starten lymphatic drainaige massage, acupuncture and exercise - stretching and rebounder. My only other symptoms are mild pain in the left throat and under arm as the day wears on every day.  Do any of you have any thoughts on this?  Log in to post a reply",
