I also had rads at the same time. My oncologist did send me for an ultrasound of the abdomen. Luckily, there were no liver lesions. I was told I had a \"fatty liver\". The oncologist believes it was b/c of all the chemicals that are dumped onto our livers.... The other thought he had was that the liver was being touched by the rads. Either way, the liver enzymes have corrected itself since I finished chemo and rads. Also, it's a good sign that your bilirubin range is normal. I would check with your oncologist to see if he/she concurs with my oncologist....You could also ask for an u/s if that will ease your mind too.

I want to ease you mind by letting you know I was diagnosed with Stage 3 IDC. I went into a research study that was very aggressive. I had chemo and radiation first. Then a mx. I started chemo Aug 31 and Feb 19th I found out I am cancer free. I know it's overwhelming and scary at first but you can does this but make sure that you always stay on top of all the Dr's. My advice to you for Wed. Write down a bunch of questions and have someone like your DH take notes. The information will be alot at first to process and you want to have it written down so that you can refer to it later. Also, ask for copies of your test results and pathology report. Then if you want to understand them better you can go online and research it better. Please keep me posted how you make out on Wed. I will be thinking of you. Chalex Diagnosis: Aug 4/09, IDC, Stage 3, tumour 5cm, Grade 3/3, ER+/PR+ HER+",
