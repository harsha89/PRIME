I would go back and tell him or her your other symptoms. Sounds like you might need some tests done. It could be that your breast issue and these other symptoms are not related at all. If you like and trust your doctor, go back for follow up. If you are not sure, get a second opinion. Your school nurse might be able to help you if your not sure where to go. If it is possible, please talk to your parents or guardians or some other trusted adult to help you out. I think you need some answers but please try not to carry this burden alone. Pat",

On to chemo in October. I came out with minimal effects. Just some soreness, redness, itching yadayada.... My secret weapons....... 1. Dove sensitive skin soap. 2. \"California Baby\" Cream. This was recommended to me. It is a calendula based cream found in baby dept. at Target. I started creaming 3x/day: AM, after treatment and before bed. START DAY 1. BEFORE YOUR SKIN SHOWS SYMPTOMS! 3. I started aquaphor 2 x /day to areas once they started getting open and red. 4. Bought several inexpensive camisoles and tank tops to wear under my bra. I could wear my under wires throughout. This cushions the bra and keeps cream from rubbing off on clothes and bra. I know everyone is different but can say it wasn't as bad as I Thought. My fatigue has been worse than skin issues. Acupuncture and mild exercise helped some. Had 8 boosts to my incision at the end and my underarm was already healing considerably. Will keep up with the cream for another few week. Best wishes everyone !!! Pat",

I was just grade 1. Don't know my ki-67 (wasn't on my report so probably not done.) My nurse navigator said I wouldn't need the Oncotype. \"That's just for those who might need chemo\". I was uncomfortable as my estrogen was just 25% so I wasn't sure that I should put all my eggs in the anti-hormonal basket. I spoke to my oncologist about my concerns and she thought they were legit and ordered the oncotype. My tumor was also small so they had to send samples a couple times and so results took longer. My oncotype came back in the dreaded mid range (which I was expecting ). I opted to take the chemo and have never looked back. I think if you are willing to do chemo if indicated then do not hesitate to ask. I am so glad I did! I don't understand why some women have the oncotype when they have no intention of doing the chemotherapy even if in high risk group with oncotype over 30. I respect the decision but why get the test? Keep us posted as to what your doctor said and what you decide. Good Luck! Pat",

God is with you through this, I truly believe that. So sorry this is happening mid wedding planning. Please ask your surgeon the pros and cons of each surgery and reconstruction plan if needed. Ask about Oncotype testing . This is a test that checks 21 genes and will give you a recurrence score and idea if chemo would benefit you. If you are not comfortable, certainly seek a second opinion. Please come here often as you get more information. The ladies here are great. Also see the postings for \"newbies\" that will also help you formulate questions. Please keep us posted Pat",

This is a very good option if headaches are a problem and you want to save your narcotics for very severe situations. Of course check with your doctor before taking any new med. Excedrin migraine is a combinations of Tylenol, aspirin and caffeine. If this doesn't work Fiorocet is another good migraine med . It is a prescription and could be addicting but not near as strong as the hydrocodone. I feel for you. Have had migraines since childhood and they are miserable.",
