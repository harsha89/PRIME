So for the past two months or so, my left nipple has been exceptionally itchy and about 2 weeks ago started oozing and becoming flaky, to the point that I'm peeling chunks of dead skin off. I thought maybe at first it was psoriasis, but the cream my doctor prescribed hasn't worked or made any improvement. I have to sleep with a bra on, because if my nipple touches the material of my shirt or something it will instantly flare up and my entire left breast will become so itchy I end up scratching it raw. Another thing I've noticed is that it's slightly deformed in a sense- there is an odd bulge towards the side of it that doesn't quite perk up with the rest of the nipple, if that makes any sense? I'm just a little worried because I Googled all this stuff and the only thing I found was that it might be Paget's disease, so if someone could tell me I'm fine or that I should see a doctor that'd be great help!!! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
