I'm so happy to hear that you are cancer free and with no horrifing drugs to clear up left-over cells. I know this is a personal question, but have you looked yet? Anyways, good luck to you and prayers also. Azcamm",

Turned out benign however, they placed a titiatium marker in that breast for future mammograms.  I've been having pain in that breast for some time now.  Sometimes, I can lay on my tummy in bed and it will start to hurt. Other times, I'll just be sitting reading or watching tv and I will get a stabbing pain. What could this mean?  I might add that this pain is not in the exact area of the biopsy.  Is it possible that my breast is still healing or maybe some kind of infection?   Anyone ?????

As for me all my waking moments are spent thinking about it and I think even my dreams are involved. I guess the only thing we can really do right now, until results come back, is to keep busy, talk to our friends, read up on the subject, etc. As I mentioned, I go tomorrow for the 2nd mammo xray on the breast in question. I also have a bone scan scheduled for Osterpiros (spelling???) right before the mammogram. What a busy day. My doctor's are an hour and a half driving time from where I live and then back home again so I'm sure that tiredness will set in. Will let you know how it all went. My GYN says that sometimes the Radiologist will discuss the findings with you right after so I'll have to see if that happens. Otherwise, I will hear back from my GYN doc. Have a good day !",
