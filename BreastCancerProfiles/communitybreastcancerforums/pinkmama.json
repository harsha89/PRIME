I little fogged out yesterday (i think due to decodron) but today that feeling is gone.  The waiting is the biggest problem. Your mind just wanders.

Yesterday I was walking laps and feeling pretty good, I guess I'll be down for the next few days.   I'm trying to get a handle on the hi's and low's so next round will be easier to plan my life around.  I think knowing what to expect helps a little bit.     Hope you guys are doing okay with your SE's.   Jamie",
