I think my WBC are up because I have felt fine for the last week but I still don't want to take chances... Thankful4 - Doc said don't use the Biotene, just the solution below, FYI - I also asked about dental floss and he said just use the kind that's woven, not waxed and not Glade..Gosh, your hair coming out in clumps must have been shocking..any Tears?  I considered getting buzzed when it falls out but I'll wait until that time comes and see what's in store for me.  Yes, I hope all of our taste buds get to enjoy the Turkey and stuffing and everything else we consume. Let's just hope our bowels hold up too! Traii try the 1tsp baking soda/1tsp salt w 12 oz water, it is more balanced and neutralizes better than all salt.

Anyway girls, just keep your chin up, holidays are always hard.  Just keep the faith and look to the future and there will be a future.  We are in this together.  When I wanted to quit smoking I joined a site www.Quitnet.com   and I made friends there and we helped each other through those hard times.  I never would have made it on my own but with the support of others I/and they have quit smoking after many years. I started smoking as a teenager and my quit date was March 6, 2008!!! So as you can see, you are in the right place, we will help each other all the way and sometime down the road, we will remember these days and these new friends will remain special to us. We can do this - God Bless all of you! Your Friend Tricia",

Looks like a lot of You girls are having a down week, maybe it's the stress of our treatments,  the Christmas & New Year holiday season, wonering if we can manage all that needs to be done, still have energy and a smile on our face.  Hope things get better for everyone.  Praying for better days ahead - Love you Kids. The Mom",

Relax and rest and post when you need too.  Good luck.  Please note, it is 3:15 am, and I have not gone to bed yet (up since 4 am, almost 24 hours- I never sleep anyway but these steroids make me a walking zombie, I just breaded some veal cutlet for tomorrow night- how pathetic is that _ my treatment is at 8:30...

Junebug, I went to dr last week because I was stumbling around = this too shall pass My girlfriends just brought me a nice, soft, fluffy electric blanket - I turned it on, took off my shoes and my hair, jumped under the blanket and slept for an hour = its's the best gift I got this year...I'm gonna sleep good tonight...",

As you may remember, I had my final chemo on Jan 15 and felt as rotten as the rest of you but for the last few days I feel like my good old self, no issues (well still have runny nose and cough sometimes) but the fatique seems to have passed, no more running to the bathroom and I only sleep at night (not all day long)and no more touretts!!.  Another big thing - the sun was shining in my window when I was putting on my makeup and guess what I saw  - new hair sprouting, it's gray but who cares...about an 1/8 of an inch . So I figure it starts to grow after 3 months of chemo - oh tomorrow night I am going to that \"look good feel better\" class - hope I learn how to put on scarves and come home with some new makeup..  OK so chemo is finished and today I started radiation - I had my tatoo's and CAT scan last week and today after they got me all in position I got radiated - didn't take long at all = after that they traced the area with red magic marker (gosh about 1/2 my chest is traced from side ribs to lower boob to center of chest and up across top of boob).  Anyway after they got me all marked up, they took pictures - yep, you just might recognize me on Facebook!!!!   I will go 5 days week x 6.5 weeks, like many of you.  Got the Aloe and the cornstarch ready.. OK girls, I am here will be back here posting but I am trying to get back to some normal daily living you know like cleaning the closets and vacumning the carpet - maybe even some much needed exercise......send me a message anytime, I will always answer - take care.  Love you girls - Tricia",

Felt some pulling and tugging but it's gone and I'm a happy camper. Girls My boob is sore and some times I get such a stabbing pain - it's also shrinking from the radiation-------Now I'm going to be \"one hung low\" Paula I didn't realize you were still gettin chemo - so don't worry about keeping up with the walks, just rest up and read that book our girl Leslie wrote///Mine will arrive tomorrow or Friday...can't wait to start reading, although I did read a few of her chapters on Facebook - going to be very interesting.  Michelle I'm glad you are feeling more energetic these days. ",

I couldn't get my fat ass up!!! I had to roll over and banged my shoulder so now I'm sore but in the meantime, I took apart the crib I had set up for my 2 yr old grandson who never used it. then I proceeded to haul that downstairs to the garage and the freakin sideboard fell on my leg and now I'm bruised up - why oh why didn't I just relax today - at least I didn't break any bones.....Now I'm off to get some Aleve!!!!  Hope you girls had a good weekend.  Tomorrow I'm off to the breast surgeon and hopefully she will discharge me - Yippee....Sweet dreams everyone",

I always said I would \"never\" get chemotherapy and here I am, waiting to get it started & overwith. I had an Xcela power injectable port inserted last Thursday October 25.. It is very annoying any one else have an uncomfortable port? Will be on decadron with the chemotherapy -- not fair that I will Gain weight on chemo when others lose it.. :0(. Will also get a neulasta shot the day after treatment. I am scheduled for 4 treatments; 30 radiation & 5 years of hormone therapy --- all for a someone who doesn't even like to take an aspirin! I had the onco DX test and my score was 34...too high to get away with just radiation, the surgeon& medical onco were both surprised with that result because I was only stage 1 with no lymph node involvement. Anyone else in the same boat? One more thing....Good luck to everyone ..let's keep our sense of humor, it will help us through this.. Smile :o)",

I also add about 2 tbsp. chicken base like Wylers or something  From here the choice is yours but I like to use, fresh sliced carrots, celery, onion and some garlic; or you can use a bag of frozen mixed veggies (not canned, except corn)of your choice, maybe even a chopped tomato and seasoning of your choice.  when the chicken is cooked, pull meat off and disgard bones , now I add 1 box frozen chopped spinach. Simmer..Thats the basics, then I like to add some small pasta  (I use ditalini or small shells) If you like, you can add some tiny meatballs and get some grated romano or parmasan cheese that tops it off - yummie. PS, I  love to cook!!",

Is  anyone losing weight?  I haven't lost an ounce!!! Sometimes I get swollen ankles and hands - maybe water retention but I look puffy - maybe steroids",

Junebug, sending good wishes your way, let us know what the doc says... Megan, glad to see you back where you belong - I'm waiting for the weather to warm up so I can take a walk.. We have a cemetary around the block which is a good place to go for a nice long uphill/downhill walk but I don't have that energy yet..  Did some floor exercises yesterday and a few with weights - need to get my body tightened up and my bones stronger in prep for that awful med I have to take for 5 years- Arimidex.  Your right about rads - it's a drag.. The few long hairs on my head are my old leftover ones but I see and feel about 1/4\" of new (gray) hair coming in - last chemo was Jan 15; 1st Rads Feb 4 - I should be finished by Easter....

As this study shows, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer can come back -- even after 5 or 10 years -- and hormonal therapy after surgery reduces that risk. You must remember that. Side effects caused by hormonal therapy can be very troublesome for many women. It's important to talk to your doctor as soon as you start having any side effects, including hot flashes, joint pain, blood clots, trouble sleeping, fatigue, or difficulty concentrating. Don't wait until the symptoms are intolerable and you have to stop taking the medicine. There are steps you can take to ease these side effects, including switching to a different type of hormonal therapy. For more information, visit the Breastcancer.org pages on Staying on Track With Treatment. You can read about why it's so important to stick to your treatment plan, as well as ways to manage side effects after radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. If you're taking hormonal therapy after surgery now, stick with it as prescribed. If you're thinking of stopping early, talk to your doctor first. Together, you can find a solution that is best for you\"",

Yes, I got a flu shot before treatment but not the shingles shot because it's a live virus - not good for us. I will drink a glass of wine with my Thanksgiving dinner!",

TLYM thank you for the beautiful story Sister - have a wonderful Thanksgiving Sister Sick of Pink - only you would have your hair buzzed off in such style - glad your \"sisters\" are there to help you through - now go buy some cute dangly earrings...and a nice hat! My Hair is coming out in handfuls - I have to get it buzzed tomorrow for sure or maybe I'll let my daughter do it (or not) after we have our family dinner today - what's everyone else doing about your hair!!! Adiago I feel so bad that you were so sick - do you think you drank too much water or because you didn't have the right antinausea meds? All caregivers - here is a toast to you, may you always have the strength to care for those you love and enough leftover to care for yourself - God Bless Hope I didn't forget anyone, I couldn't scroll back far enough...Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!",

Diet/Exercise - Have any of you exercised since your surgery? First it was the sore boob and arm pit, then it was the port, it's been months and now I feel flabby everywhere, wait- I am ! I'm eating more protein. Hair - lost most of it in 6 days ! I should have just shaved it.    Fresh Fruit/Veggies  I miss salads also but  I use a commercial Fruit & Veggie wash on leafy greens and  I peel the skins off apples,oranges, etc. but I find it's easier and safer to use frozen veggies. Juicing - I juice sometimes but I'd rather eat the whole fruit, as sickofpink or someone said, it's more nutritious.  Germs I am so sick of being a germophobic - I am becoming a recluse for fear of germs and I'm tired of using hand sanitzer and clorox wipes but I will..and I miss my grandchildren- you know, the ones who come home from school with germs you could almost see dancing in front of you!!!  Steroids -  being on steroids is great if you want to do things run marathons, climb mountains and move furniture (yesterday I almost pulled my port out moving furniture) for you younger girls, awake all night is kind of like menopause and I haven't slept good in years!!!  Well it's 6:00am, chat later girls",

Anyway, the reason I haven't been posting is my \"Chemo Brain\", although my daughter says it's my normal brain, I just use chemo as an excuse =but I know you girls would set her straight!   I've been having an awful time staying focused and my husband says I'm having bouts of \"Touretts\", I have been losing my temper and using those words - you know.  Bet you've been down that road once or twice yourself  I see lots of the same issues we've all had popping up here..fatique, hair loss, Constipation, diarrhea, hemmoroids poor Politcomama in her sitz bath (suggestion - get a little spritz bottle and mix the baking soda and water that we've been using just squirt this one  \"wherever your on fire down below\"  Ahh , instant relief. As far as the butt pain, I put some cold clear Aloe Vera on it and that helps alot - it will get better... I'm trying to walk like Leslie because I feel all my muscles are getting week and I trip over my own two feet....TLYM I'm glad you perked up and went to a nice restaurant with the man.... and you Teacher - what the heck -your period but I remember someone else got hers last week!! That sucks!!!  And where's our leader Michelle? She was really under the weather for awhile, are you OK Michelle,,  Looks Like we are all having longer fatique issues.  Gotta try that Look Good Feel Better class like Paula went to, looks like a lot of good tips.  So far everyone loves my wig and says I look 10 years younger (I'll take that compliment) its a reddish brown and a short bob .  I think I'll be losing the rest of my hair soon, last time it was 15 days after treatment..  Milkyway, stick around, this group will perk you up no matter what you lose - right girls?  Megan, I don't know how you are managing going back and forth - in our chemo unit we have seperate little cubby's and TVs but everyone pretty much stays put, if you want to take a guess, you might say that I am the talker of the group - surprised!!  Megan and SickofPink how's is that Ativan working for you girls..    I was down until Tuesday but then last night Wednesday - I perked right up - my son and daughter and their spouses and my 5LUVBUGS came over, I made dinner for everyone and was soooooo happy to have all my grandkids all here again, germs and all - it was loud and noisy and crazy, just like it was before = I loved every minute of it (but it was nice and quiet when they left and after I wiped down everything with clorox wipes.  Then I threw up from coughing so much every time I laid down but I found the good old fashion natural solution = parts, honey, whiskey and lemon - it's a natural cough, cold cure all - I actually used Canadian VO from 1983 < I didn't want to use the one from 1967, that's the year I was married - Yikes)!!!! I'm getting that online shopping done and now I will wrap some of those gifts that arrived at my front door..Ahh life is good!!! Good Night Kids and have a great day tomorrow. Love the Mom",

SickofPink I hope you got to enjoy your company and had a nice meal OUT!  Now about that video I sent the link for - I never got to part 2, guess I should have seen it myself before I sent the link and yes - soy is bad for us, so is sugar don't know what she said but I get I will check it out tonite when everyone of you is asleep and I am here all by myself.... Macyhen did you find that kindle - maybe you weren't suppose to see the video - you probably ate lots of junk food being with the kids - ah heck - enjoy every morsel... Eleni I've had a few crying spells myself this week - melt downs, pity party - call it what you want - sometimes we just need to cry! Keetmom, I'm glad your daughter is helping you but don't wear her or yourself out. Yeah Dakota - glad your finished the worst of it. Powermom, the glad press and seal sounds like a plan for the stubbles Politicomom  I still have some hair  like you - don't worry your chemo is working.... Ok, now I'm going to get a hot shower and try to relieve some of these pains..",

As far as my drug it will be Arimidex, I cannot take Tamoxifin because I had blood clots and pulmonary embolism when I was young (27) and it would be too risky for me but the drug I am going to take will cause bone lose so then I need to take reclast to counteract that and both drugs have lots of side effects - does this ever get easy???? ",

Yesterday I colored my hair for the first time since October  It's app 1\" and I looked like a silver fox (salt & Pepper) well I didn't want to go really dark so I used Loreal Medium Ash Blonde - it's ok but not the color I thought it would be but it's better than the salt and pepper and it's stayed nice and soft.   I've been taking Anastrozole Hormone Blockersince April 5 and it's not so bad yet.  I do get some hot flashes an hour or two after I take it and my joints get stiff but that's pretty normal for me, so I'm not giving them up yet.  I've been getting upset the last few days because some people don't recognize me or don't acknowledge me - I've always had long dark hair but now I wear a hat or short lighter colored wig. Ok so I've gained some weight in the last 5 years since I quit smoking but I've know these people for years.  Are they avoiding me?  I feel bad...Most people I see tell me how good I look (for a cancer victim I guess) and I just say I feel good but are they lying to me, do I really look good or like shit!!!!  I am feeling old, fat and ugly right now....  so I'm going to try to go back to sleep...",

About the hair, we are all in the same boat so when you feel bad, come here - where your friends are.  I think most of us got our hair cut shorter already. Maybe all meds don't make your hair fall out. Ck with your Doc. Junebug did you order anything?  I keep browsing but hesitate.  At least I have my wig ready.

There is a small link on this website you can check it out. When you go to the doctor make sure your husband or daughter take a notebook and write down what was said and any questions you have. That's what I do and I go back and read them time after time - it's important.   Listen, we are all here for you so come back with questions.  One big hint for everyone.  Prevent mouth sores, don't forget the baking soda water rinse day of chemo and a few days after. (2tbsp baking soda, 1 quart/or liter water, swish 4 x a day.  It will help us.  Michelle, I haven't lost any hairs \"down below yet\" but I guess that's next including my eyelashes and eyebrows, yikes....as I said before I already look like my grandmother and she died in 1984!!!!

Now I have a tooth with a cracked root so I need an extraction- this tooth had \"2\" root canals and a crown plus fillings, so I calculate it to be at least a $2,800 tooth that I'm getting pulled!!  After all that I'll have a space and probably an infection to go with it...I guess after all our chemo our immune systems are shot and haven't built back up yet..",
