She also has sores on her butt, and on the tip of her toe.  I looked on this website, and strangely enough , I don't see sores(other than mouth sores) listed as a side effect of chemo.  I know that her chemo has reduced her resistance to infection, but are sores really so common? She is being treated with Taxol and Herceptin, Lovanox, lots of Oxycontin and Lyrica due to the cancer affecting nerves. Log in to post a reply",
