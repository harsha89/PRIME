Good luck !",

I finally will see a radiation oncologist on the 31st of Jan, and will have an 1 1/2 hour consult with the team.  My surgery was the 2oth of Dec (lumpectomy, 8mm IDC. Grade l, stage 1,or so I think, sentinel node biopsy neg).  I am very interested in hearing about everyone else's experiences as they move through radiation treatments.  It is so wonderful to feel like things are starting to move again.  I believe there will be another session to map and then another wait to get the actual treatments started.  Anyone have any ideas on how many treatments i can look forward to?  I've heard anywhere from 15 to 33. By the way, I live in BC, Canada.",

My question.  Has anyone heard of this or participated in this study?  It is in its 3rd year and will involve a total of 2128 women.",

Anyone had any experience with this?  I have to travel to a larger centre and don't relish doing this for 4 weeks, especially as I have to time it to the times the ferry runs, as well as the drive, but, at the same time, I want the most effective treatment.  The amount of radiation given is a little less ( 42 Grays of radition for the 16 whole breast, 38.2 for the partial breast but it is directed to the surgical tumour bed only).  The oncologist was vague when I enquired about results so far.  I like the idea of it being \"over\" (is it ever really over?) in 5 days, but wonder if I am exchanging convenience for cure.  Opinions?
