My surgery was Feb 2013. I had alot of the same pain you are having. I am actually having more pain in my arm on the side they took nodes. Nerves are a funny thing...they take so long to heal. I think it is because alot of trauma when they put the permenant implants back in immediately. It is not like you are getting fills every week. I did not want to leave my home for the first month. I can honestly say that at the two month mark I was really turning the corner. Fabric is pretty important. I could not stand flannel or anything that was not soft cotton or microfiber. Hang in there. You are making progress!  Lisa ",

It stings at first, you absorb it, give yourself a couple minutes to deal with it, then you figure out a positive plan because you have alot to fight for. I am amazed at how well you are doing after surgery. :) Prepare yourself for a few ups and downs as you go through this. That way, you won't beat yourself up if you have a bad day. Your body has alot to heal from. I had ALOT of arm pain about a week after surgery. In fact, I felt like the arm pain, numbness and freezing cold hand was worse than everything else for a little while. The nerves do get all stirred up and nerve pain is a tough thing. The skin sensitivity is real bad too. I am a month out of surgery, and things have finally started to calm down in my arm. I have read that nerves are slow to heal. So we have to remember that they take a little while when messed with.  I have had other stupid complications that you are not having to deal with, so we will concentrate on what you have going on. Make sure you get real good direction from your Oncologist. I think your Onco will come up with some treatments you might not have thought of. Chemo helps thousands of people. Do you have a Cancer Treatment Centers of America near you? They are aggressive in the breast cancer fight and they also give complimentary treatment suggestions and some alternatives that are working real well.  I have several friends that have recommended them that went through big dx's.  It seems like I remember on a visit years ago, they had one close to where I went to school in Tulsa. I did not have one near me, but I did get a second and a third opinion to settle my mind about what I was doing. I noticed you used Vit C to help the constipation. That is great info. Sounds like you do your homework and you will get the best care for you and for your boy.  I wish you the best, and hope your doctors appointment gives you a big dose of encouragement too!  Lisa ",
