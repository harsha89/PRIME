MRI after cy4 shows it is gone. My surgeon says I\u2019m cancer free. My onc won\u2019t use that term. His goal is to cure me. This 5th and 6th treatment is like \u201cinsurance\u201d but I\u2019m feeling DONE. questioning do I need the 6th? I had triple X. This is my 3rd time breast cancer. Was 19 years cancer free. Then 3 years cancer free after mastectomy. I\u2019m healthy and fit - but not sure I can endure a 6th treatment. My side effects have been manageable until 5th cycle ( which was initially to be 4 cycles). Overall, I tolerated this cocktail well. Did not need to flip to taxol. Still have my hair. The fatigue overwhelms me - physically and psychologically. More nausea this cycle - seems body takes longer to recover between cycles. I will discuss with my onc how 5 vs 6 matters. If 5 is enough. Anybody thoughts or advise out tgere",
