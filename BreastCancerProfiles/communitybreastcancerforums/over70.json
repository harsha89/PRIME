I have an half circle near the bottom of the left breast that sporadically gets a ltttle red and wrinkles. It is really weird because it can come and go within minutes and be completely smooth. My surgeon said it was lymph drainage. I've been experimenting with sports bras, that's I am curious about the Under Armour one.",
