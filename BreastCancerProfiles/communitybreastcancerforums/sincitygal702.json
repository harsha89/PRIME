I woke up this morning and my left breast/armpit area has a burning sensation. It kind of feels like there is icy hot on it. I don't have any other symptoms. I'm 27 and I know bc is rare but not unheard of for women my age. My aunt had stage 3 ibc in her early 50s and is doing well with 12 years ned. Any insight on what this burning icy hot feeling could be? I will be seeing my gyn in a couple weeks for something unrelated but I'll be sure to mention this if it is still happening. Thanks :) JamieÂ  Log in to post a reply",
