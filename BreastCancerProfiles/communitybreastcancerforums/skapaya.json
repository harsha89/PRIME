I tried to find the answer to this, and was wondering if you could help (this is absolutely a shameless attempt to get hints as to what my biopsy results might be)... Why would a doctor order a Core Needle over a Fine Needle biopsy? Is one more indicitive of cancer than the other? Â Also, what should I expect? Is it painful? I'm going alone and dont want to start crying and become a hot mess. Nobody would be my friend after that. So I am trying to prepare myself, and Dr. Google is not being very comforting tonight.

I wont know definitively rather or not I\u2019m ok\u2026 for what seems like forever. My nipples were hurting. Both of them. Little compasses pointing towards an undeniable fact, something is not right. I don\u2019t have a uterus\u2026 a necessary extraction after a very tough pregnancy. So, I assumed that the changes in my breasts had to be hormonal. Menopause, maybe? The men in my house would not be ready for that adventure. Maybe an ovarian cyst wrecking hormonal havoc? I wasn\u2019t sure, and the pain was annoying so I made an appointment with my OBGYN. She walks in, and I recite the speech I practiced in my head. I have a unique medical history, that requires me to summarize my medical record succinctly. \u201c Hey Doc. So, My body likes to grow things. Gall stones, cysts, fibroids, and organ eating placentas. As a result, I no longer have a uterus. I have my ovaries, and I\u2019ve been poked, squished and prodded more times than I like. Just this week, I finally finished a project that I\u2019m hoping will keep me very busy. So, whatever is going on in my breasts\u2026 I need it to be something I can take medication for. A simple explanation that doesn\u2019t require being poked or prodded\u201d A simple request really. I just don\u2019t have time for another medical question mark. The doctor examines me, and asks tons of questions. I respond, making light of, and trying to discourage her now serious fondling of my right breast. \u201cYes. I noticed the dimple in my breast. It\u2019s kind of wrinkly. Guess we all get old.\u201d \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a lump? I\u2019ve had them before, that feels more like a long grain of rice\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure this is all apart of menopause\u201d She patiently explains that at 33 I\u2019m much to young for menopause, even though I don\u2019t have a uterus. She apologizes and says, I think you\u2019re going to have to be poked and prodded. She orders an ultrasound. Being the type that is prone to grow things, I call me breast doctor and schedule an appointment. They know me there. In the past three years I\u2019ve had 4 mammograms, countless ultrasounds, a lumpectomy, and 3 biopsies. All benign. I call, and schedule an appointment. I meet with my breast doctor, and she gives me an ultrasound. She is a very serious looking lady. Tall and thin. She has short blond, almost platinum hair. She is kind, but not overtly emotional. She has great poker face. I hear words, and I hang on to the ones I want to Google later. \u201cSolid Mass. Shadowing. Biopsy\u201d She tries to show me what she sees on the ultrasound machine. It all looks like grey matter to me. I lie. I tell her I see what she sees. I think to myself, WOW, she is really into this. I try to gauge her concern. Does she look worried? I can\u2019t tell. She tells me she would feel better if I had a newer mammogram. I schedule a mammogram for the following day, and a biopsy for a few days later. I walk out the exam room to checkout. I wonder if the people handling my chart no something I don\u2019t. Are they being nice to me because they think I have cancer? I\u2019m over analyzing everything. I can\u2019t wait to ask Dr. Google some questions. I make it to my mammogram the next day. It\u2019s early in the morning. Dr. Google informed me that mammograms reports are often times given a BIRADS number. It\u2019s a number that rates the likelihood of cancer, and offers suggestions for next steps. 1 means it\u2019s all-good in the hood. 5 means, sorry kid. We\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s cancer. My mission\u2026 get my BIRADS score. I have a plan, I will ask the radiologist what my score is. I don\u2019t. I freeze. Why do I freeze? I muster some courage and ask for a copy of the report at checkout. They tell me it\u2019s not ready. I then remember that all my reports post to my online patient portal. I\u2019ll get an email letting me know that it\u2019s in. So the stalking begins. I stalk my email. Waiting. Waiting for news\u2026 that is not definitive\u2026 but a better indicator of rather or not I am ok. I try to remember The Secret\u2026. Words are things. Positive thoughts, Mya. Think Positive. Then I am bombarded with self-doubt. Can positive thoughts cure what already is? Can it reverse the worst scenario? Why did this lump feel so much different than my other ones. How come I didn\u2019t recognize it as a lump? Positive thoughts. Positive thoughts. Â  Log in to post a reply",

I've been checking the email for an update to my online chart with the type of anticipation one has when expecting a call from a crush.Â  Thinking that any information is better than none, I asked my doctor for the notes from the ultrasound. Nothing terribly informative there either. I was hoping for more adjectives. Words that could help me describe to doctor google exactly what was seen. Instead, all I learned is that I had a solid mass, 1cm, and the Impression is indeterminate. Indeterminate seemed to be less ominous then \"highly suspicious\", until I googled it. So I wait. I'd feel better knowing the BI-RADS score, I think. I mean... Having a probability of some sort seems more manageable then being in the dark. I'm rambling. Time for work.",

I felt a lump in my breast, and after a couple of weeks I finally made an appointment with my doctor. I waited to make the appointment because I wasnt exactly sure what I was feeling was a lump. WhatÂ I Â feel is thick, not exactly round, and it doesn't seem to move. It's small. Like the size of a pea. I guess it just didnt feelÂ what I thought a lump should feel like.Â Â I did know, that is wasntÂ  \"normal\". I was really surprised when the doctor was able to find the lump without any direction from me. It validated that what I was feeling was \"real\", and for the first time felt a little scared. Â She told me that it was really small, but she wanted me to get a diagnositic mammogram as soon as possible. She told me that if I was asked to wait longer than 2 days, to call back and get a referral to someone else. Her urgency scared me a bit. My appointment is on Wednesday. I was told that a doctor would be present during the mammogram, so I wont have to wait for results (small victory). Â Hopefully it is just a cyst.Â  I am telling people I am not worried, and I am sure everything will be fine. That's not exactly the truth. I have 3 sons, and a great husband, and I am scared. Â I'm hoping that I can find someone who is on a journey similar to mine that I can buddy with. I imagine that going through this with someone who has gone through it before would be less stressful.

The doc said that the sample looks benign, but one of the samples came back suggesting intraductal papilloma, so I am now having an excisional biopsy to make sure I'm all good on the 2nd. I read that intraductal papilloma is benign, so not sure why the worry. Anyone else know? Also, what could he mean by \"looks\" benign?",

What sucks even more is that I called the doctors office back, and convinced the lady to have a nurse give me the results. Only to find out that my path report actually DIDNT come in, and the receoptionist was refering to my ultrasound report .
