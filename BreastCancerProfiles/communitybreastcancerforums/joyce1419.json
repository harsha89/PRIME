I had mammogram  placement--and mammos are always painful for me--of the wire pre- lumpectomy and there was big needle of lidocaine for that   and i had radioactuve dye inserted via large neeedle into nipple after that for location of sentinel node.  i then had a painful, 30 minute over the head, don't move, with a sore shoulder period in order to take photos of the node. This was all pretty, very traumatic.  I told the staff recently that someone should have written standing orders for some relaxant, ativan type, and some pain meds taken before all of this. As rough as chemo has been, that presurgery will stay memorable.  If I had known more details beforehand about those pre-surgery procedures, I would have requested something.  But THEY should have better protocol to offer, and the RN agreed and said she would make that  suggestion.   By contrast, the surgery was a non-experience. Good luck.  I hope your experience is more tolerable.  Joyce",
