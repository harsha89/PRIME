      "Content": "jc268 wrote: hello  I'm wondering if anyone can shed any light on the meaning of lymphocytes being found in my biopsy. I had an FNA biopsy which found atypical cells (that part I understand), but it also yielded lymphocytes, and I'm less clear on the implications of that. My surgeon is recommending a core biopsy to get a better sample, so I'm waiting (yet again) for that appointment to be set up. In the meantime, I'm driving myself nutty googling lymphocytes... Background is I have a palpable lump in the right breast, upper outer quadrant, that they tell me feels more like a lump than a lymph node. It showed up on mammogram as a 1.5 cm nodular density. They did an FNA because ultrasound said it was a cyst, but then the FNA biopsy found a solid mass (possible that a cyst formed near it and obscured the mass during the ultrasound) as the FNA did not yield any fluid.

(The questions that is, not the symptoms, because I'm not having any of those issues...). Anyway, I guess I'll just have to wait and see. Next step is another ultrasound on the 29th. I found this lump in May and I'm still in test-mode. I'm really starting to lose it here. ",

Just had an MRI, and am going for a core biopsy next week. Sometimes atypia is just that, but sometimes it can indicate that there may be cancer in the area. what kind of biopsy did you have? What did the report say? ",

Just got my needle biopsy results yesterday, which found atypical cells which the surgeon said are suggestive for malignancy. Did your doctor give you anything more than \"inconclusive\"? In my case, given the atypia, he said we were probably looking at a lumpectomy now and lymph node removal. Hard to take it all in. I totally understand the mind running wild. Thinking of you from across the world and wishing you benign results! jc",
