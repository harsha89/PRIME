    "Content": "2bme wrote: I'm almost 60 years old. A few weeks ago after my annual mammogram, I was found to have small DCIS, high grade (comedo necrosis), hormone receptive, in my left breast. Surgeon recommends lumpectomy, radiation (21 sessions), and hormone therapy, stating recurrence rate of 5-7% afterwards. I'm really nervous about hormones, as I've battled hormone-related depression, including postpartum depression, on and off throughout my life, but finally have been feeling free of the ups and downs (had a hysterectomy years ago, still have ovaries). I would not feel secure not taking hormones after the lumpectomy, as it is said to greatly reduce the risk of recurrence. I'm seriously thinking of a double mastectomy, after which I would not have to take hormones.The removal of one breast would be the treatment, with the removal of the other for preventative measure and to be move symmetrical. Surgeon says mastectomy is always an option, but of course feels that breast conservation is best. I need to start a treatment plan soon, and want to decide this week....HELP!?
