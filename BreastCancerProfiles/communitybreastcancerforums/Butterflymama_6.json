Almost 2yrs ago I had itchy redness with the swelling, they gave me cream to put on it, red spots never fully went away. Had mamo, no lumps etc found. Have had other medical issues/surgery in the last yr with complications non breast related. (hysterectomy). I am 38, my Mom, Aunt and their Aunt has had breast cancers. No full stories on any as I am estranged from my family.  I am very very nervous afterreading ALL the complications ladies have had getting it diagnosed. I have to go to a clinic as I don't have health insurance. I guess my question is, how do I be persistent enough without them just trying to send me away with cream again? Do my other health issues play into this type of cancer?  Am I being paranoid?  A hypercondract? Ugh.... Thank you for reading, Jesika  Log in to post a reply",
