And yes she might cut me off but honestly it's a chance i am willing to take. That is why everyone is afraid to give their opinion cause they are afraid of being cut off, not me i'm not afraid i want her to go talk to her doctors and then make her decision. She got preliminary results and then decided to leave for three weeks off to a holistic health center and still has not gone back to get the final results. She has not even educated herself on her disease.All i want is for her to make her decision after she has all the facts, then i will accept her decision but will never ever agree with it. Life is too precious and yeah! sometimes we have to put up the fight of our lives and i am not saying it's gonna be easy, i have lived it once too many believe me.",

Princess i'm sorry didn't see the question on the alternative forum i'm new here so i'm having a hard time getting around, lol. So at around the middle of September my cousin felt a lump on her left breast called the doctor the doctor immediately sent her for a mammogram. As the technician was performing the mammogram he told her that she will need an ultrasound, had one on the spot and then the technician suggested a biopsy which again was done on the spot. Two weeks later she got the results i do have the pathology report this is what it says. IDC classification SBR-EE, grade III, tubulaire score 3/3 nuclear score 3/3 miotique score 1/3, BIRADS-5. After this report she did see oncologist and surgeon who told her she is stage III and suggested mastectomy and chemo to start, they did an mri and another biopsy in house because they wanted their own technician to do it.Immediately after the second biopsy she left the country and went to the hippocrates health institute for a three week life changing program but told the doctors that she is going on vacation. While there she decided that she will not be doing any medical treatments or surgery and is convinced her tumor has shrank. Because i have been pushing for surgery she will be finally seeing the doctors on Tuesday i hope to God they can get through to her. Sorry if i wasen't clear about her diagnosis, maybe some of you can shed some light. What do you think? am i so wrong in being petrified for her life?",

My relative is my first cousin who is very important in my life. She has not had any surgery as she refuses. As she was awaiting results a friend of hers recommended a holistic health center and she went there for three weeks where they taught her how to live this holistic lifestyle and the tumor shall go away. I for one don't buy it. I believe her decision is based on fear as her mom and my mom, they were sisters passed of chemotherapy four years ago, one three days after the other. But, she must open her eyes and see the survivors, my husband being one of them, sixteen years in remission, he actually is considered cured. Back then the chemo was even worse as the anti nausea meds were not as advanced.Â  Anyway after attending this holistic health center she truly believes she will be cured with that alone and will hear nothing that has to do with conventinal medecine from anyone. I did push today for her to at least have surgery, but do not think that i was succesful in making her rethink her decision. I am sooooooooooooo scared.",

In her mind eating wheatgrass and doing enemas is curing her she is even convinced that her tumor has shrank just by feeling it.

She is young and has a young child and has decided to refuse all medical treatments. She has chosen to live a holistic lifestyle instead and believes that this will cure her cancer. I am worried, confused, and scared. I do understand her fear of chemotherapy but i feel that the holistic approach is even more risky. Has anyone been cured of this type of cancer by living a holistic lifestyle??? Log in to post a reply",
