Dr. office said they had scheduled stereotactic biopsy on 2/23 (yesterday). Showed up for biopsy--finally got to talk to Dr. (radiologist). He said I had an \"architectural distortion\" in right breast and even if the stereo biopsy turned up negative, I should go for an incisional biopsy. Should I be as stressed out as I am? Does anyone know what percentage of architectural distortions are likley to be malignant? I'm 53, no history of cancer in family. Thanks, sorry to bother you. Somebody needs to peel me off the ceiling, I'm freaking out so badly. Log in to post a reply",
