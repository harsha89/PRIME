This is Thursday and it is getting puffy under my left arm. I know I am going to have to have it asperated. I just don't know if I should wait for next Tuesday when I see him again or go in sooner. I saw where some of you bound youself. Is it to late to try that? I really don't want a needle poking me (big fear of needles) He said he would do it in the incesion because the nerves are dead there. Any one who has had this done, does it hurt?

I did the first asperation on July 6th with the on call doctor from the clinic. there was about180 cc's so I was not in good humor. Since then I have been having it drained Tuesday and Thursday by my Dr. he was on call one Sat. and drained it. This last Sat. I called the on call Dr. and he told me the clinic was closed. I said yes but aren't you on call. Well yes but the clinic was closed. I explained how the other doctors has met me and got the job done. He asked when it was last drained and I told him last Thurs. he asked how much he got out, I told him 75cc's and he said well that isn't much. I nearly fell over and started crying. He then said he couldn't do it till 1:00 that afternoon. it was 8:00 am and I had to be to work by 11:00. He said I couldn't expect to call at 8:00 and expect it to be done that quick. I said the other doctors had wanted me to come in the morning and how was I going to know what the heck his schedule was. He kept saying at 1:00 so I told him I would goÂ  to the ER which I did. And Bless the lady Dr. that asperated it. She said they don't normaly do that in the ER and she had never done it before, so I explained the best I could between the crying. She got out 60cc's before she poked something and nearly put me through the roof. She and I agreeded that would be enough to get me through to Tuesday. My Dr only is available Tues. and Thurs. I was so sore and frustrated I just couldn't quit crying. I am not any more confidant in my own Dr. I can't get him to tell me anything other than \"some people take longer to heal\" But he will get an earfull on Tuesday about his on call doctor. I don't know what I will do the next weekend. Mud Puppies",
