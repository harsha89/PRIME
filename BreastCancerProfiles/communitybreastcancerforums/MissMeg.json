I had a lumpectomy, and did chemo, and radiation through the rest of 09 and into 10.  Friday I felt a sore spot on my neck, just above my collar bone on the same side as the cancer had been. Looking around online, I've discovered that this could be an inflammation of the supraciaclavical lymph node, and that it could be a metastisis. It hurt when I pressed on it both Fri and Sat. Today, after a good night's sleep, it hurts a lot less. It is hard to the touch, about .5 to 1 cm, and it does not move except slightly when I swallow.  I also have a condition called neurofibromatosis, type one. The tumor could be this, but I don't know.The characteristics of those tumors is to hurt when they first present, and not so much after a few days. I have I'm clinging to hope that this could be what it is, but the nightmare scenario of having to go through chemo again or of being stage IV won't go away.  I also have been having some cold-like symptoms for a few days.  So help me. I'm so frightened. It's hard to determine good information on the internet, but I've read that this could make me stage 4. I know it's not really right, but I can't help but think stage 4 as a death sentence.  I'm nearly 40 years old and really not ready to check out (who ever is, really though).  Any information would help. I just don't know if I can face this... Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Mar 9, 2011 04:15AM - edited Mar 9, 2011 04:17AM by MissMeg Hey everyone, thank you. I have an appointment for next Monday. I was due soon for a followup anyway, and I'm able to go in a few weeks early. I do have anti-anxiety medications. I rarely have problems with it anymore, I've even had my 15 pill perscription expire before I used it all. I also have other ways to help me relax, though I do think I will try the meditation as well. I talk to my mom, mostly. I hate to stress her out too but she's really the only one I want to talk to when this is going on. My closest friends have kids and moms and dads that are constantly wearing them out. I hate to bother them with my stupid anxieties. Im a teacher and one thing that always helps is the way my young students always hug me every day. That's something I pity non-teachers for not having. It's a joy (even the naughty kids). One thing that has since occurred to me, I had some thyroid problems when I was in my early to mid twenties. This could be thyroid, as it is in that exact spot. I suppose that could explain why it's not moving around much as well. It seems like it might have gotten smaller, though it is really hard for me to tell. It definitely hurts less when it's pressed on. In fact, it hardly hurts at all. It seems like if it was metastisis, the pain wouldn't go away. But I don't want to be over confident either. It's a bit of a roller coaster. My doctor said my chances for recurrence were something like 5 to 15. So those odds are still pretty good (good as in not cancer). I don't like to rely on odds too much though. At age 38, on paper, I was at very low risk of having BC. But here I am...  I suppose all this is compunded by my stress and worry for my 18 year old cousin, who is battling metastatic liver cancer. I hate hate hate hate this disease! Nobody deserves to have the rug pulled out from them like this. I wouldn't wish it on the worst person in the world.",

Im due for a followup this month anyway, and I'm calling in the morning to see if I can get in soon. How do you cope with the worry? I used to suffer from anxiety disorder, which now and then rears it's ugly head. But I basically consider that to be cured since it's so rare. But with having had cancer, now I'm getting to be hypochondriacal. I hate this. I hate it I hate it I hate it.  My body has changed. I've had a lot of things happen that had never happened previously, such as I broke a toe, I get sick more often, etc. Doc says this stuff isn't related and I shouldn't worry.  I've had sinus problems all my adult life. And never had a lymph node in this location swell up. But that doesn't mean that itt's not just the cold. I can't help but recall how I had myself convinced when I found the lump in my breast that it would turn out to be nothing. I was wrong. And now I want to believe this is ok, but I keep thinking about how I was wrong before. ",
