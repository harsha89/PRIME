Through a biopsy of six samples, it came back as fibro. However I am concerned because I've had this now since December and it is growing larger since my biopsy. Should I be concerned that it could potentially be cancerous in the future? I remember the ultrasound lady and the doctor there were concerned (before the biopsy) due to the stuff surrounding my mass because it looked unordinary. I have a very strong history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer in my family. My great aunt died of such ovarian cancer and my mother cousin passed away from breast cancer she was in her 40s. Not to mention my fathers side is riddled with cancer most of his siblings have had some form. I am concerned because I've heard for potential benign becoming malignant. It doesnt hurt (the mass) but it makes my breast very hard. Should I be worried? Many thanks to those who read this! Bless you! Log in to post a reply",
