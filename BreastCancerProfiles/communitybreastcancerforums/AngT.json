So I dont want to complain at all because I know your are facing this head on but I am really worried..... In 2010 I had clear discharge from my left nipple so I went for a mammo and ultrasound and they found a small lump in my right breast ( that was a surprise ).  Within the hour I had a FNA and was told it was probably nothing so I left and thought that would be that. Next day at lunch my phone rang it was my doctors receptionist and she said to come down to see the doctor right away and they would see me as soon as I got there and that I would not have to wait, well I knew something was up. Doctor said the pathology came back \"suspicious for carcinoma\" so ok not that bad there is still a chance its not but she insisted I see the BS within 2 days BS worried but can see I am a \"glass half full\" kind of girl so he was very encouraging after that but did say to expect a cancer diagnosis but it would be early so I would be fine.  Lumpectomy the following Friday and results come back ADH and ALH so extra monitoring but I am ok with an increased risk. I just got on with life afte that and had all my US and alternating mammos every 6 months Fast forward to last the 6 months I have not been feeling great, my last US in January I had the worst/rudest tech that rushed through in record time and made me feel bad for being there although I am on extra monitoring from previous findings but I am given the all clear. Now I have found 3 lumps in right breast and my left breast in now twice the size of the right with some clear discharge ( it was smaller from lumpectomy but now the left is inreasing in size and my husband has made a number of comments ) I also have shooting pains in my right breast. I am scheduled for an US on Tuesday for my breasts so I will know more then. Last night my neck didn't feel right and I touched it only to find a large lump like I have an adams apple but its a lump!! My husband can see/feel it too :( I have pain at the back of my neck and I was very dizzy yesterday as well. My question is can there be 2 things going on and after ADH and ALH can something come back 3 years later. Is there a connection between thyroid problems and breast cancer? I am only 38 with 2 gorgeous boys and the best husband. I dont want to cause them any worry or distress. I am worried and I am not normally a worrier but last night feeling the lump on my neck as well really scared me. Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading ( ps exuse the typos but I am the world worst typer ) Thanks Again Ang  ADH and ALH 07/10 Surgery 7/22/2010 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",

I left thinking nothing would come of it. I went to my GP the next day as I was going away and needed my script for blood thinners, she asked me when I was if I was looking for my biopsy results and I said no just my script my GP said they wont be back until around lunch time so we will only call you if it shows something I remember laughing and saying good don't call me then and left never expecting to get a call. Well at 1 o'clock the phone rang and my heart sunk I had to come down straight away and the doctor would see me in her lunch hour..... The pathology said \"suspicious for carcinoma\" everything moved quickly and I was into the BS after my weekend away and lumpectomy scheduled for the next week as the BS wanted my cancer out. 3 days after my lumpectomy the BS called and it turned out to be ADH and ALH YAY!!!! I was so relieved because up until the lumpectomy I was told it was cancer and my plan was going way beyond the lumpectomy. So even when it looks bad I just wanted to give you hope that nothing is final until they take whatever it is out and you get that final path report. I am on 6 monthly checkups now and that is fine with me :) I feel very lucky but when I feel something odd in my breast I don't ignore it.  I know how scary this whole process can be you are not alone, please let us know how you go ((HUGS)) Ang",

I am having a biopsy this Thursday. Does anyone have any idea what the changes mean or has anyone had a similar experience?

I ended up having both as my mammogram showed dense breast tissue ( i am not sure if it showed my lump ) and then the ultrasound showed what they ended up doing the biopsy on that day. It is normal for doctors to follow this procedure and to have both done on the same day. If you have any concerns tomorrow talk to the technicians while your there tomorrow.
