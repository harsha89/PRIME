So I stayed away for 2 days, came back home to a smiling and happy little boy.  However the next day, I've got the stomach flu!  I spent all day yesterday curled up in the fetal position in bed.  Thinking to myself and repeating to myself: \"are you kidding me!\"  I feel a bit better today, still a little queasy.  Anyhow, I'm just uspet, disgusted and plain, pissed off, since the chemo SE were so horrific for me as with many of us, I was feeling pretty normal and then BAM!  take that!!  ... and Monday I get to look forward to starting all over again. Sorry, I am not giving up or anything and I know this will someday be a thing of the past, but SHEASh!  Enough is enough already!  : ) My heart goes out to each and every one of you ladies.",

I seem to have had a different experience with the first treatment. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Severe nausea, light headedness and severe heartburn followed my first treatment for a full six days. On the sixth day I completely broke down when my 5 year old reached out to hug me and I dropped to the floor beside him sobbing because I didn't have the energy to hug him back. That morning my husband took me to the ER. They did some blood work and said my counts were ok. Upon examining my file and the meds I had been taking, they decided that I was one prescription short for the nausea. They also gave me some nexium for the heartburn. So hurray! I feel human again. However, I am terrified for the next round cause I keep hearing it gets worse with each treatment. So I guess my question is, based on this time taking the proper amount of SE meds, to those of you who have gone for the second time, typically how long did it take to come around? Sorry for rambling on, but I would appreciate any feedback. Thanks",
