So I have been placed on the every 6 month rotation of mammogram and/or MRI. I had my MRI last Friday to check on a 1cm lesion in my right breast. 6 months ago it presented as oval with \"minimal blood flow\"; a solid 1. They weren't able to detect it on u/s and wanted to take the wait and watch approach. Fridays results showed it has enlarged slightly and had increased blood flow; a solid 2 with a little 3 showing. They decided to biopsy while I was there. I get through the procedure and they send me back for another MRI to make sure they biopsied the right thing. When I came out; the Dr asked to speak to me again and let me know they had biopsied the wrong thing and in fact they could not locate the correct lesion through u/s. They wanted to wait for the results of this biopsy before proceeding. Results came in today and it was in factnormal healthy breast tissue; BENIGN. However; they want me to come back for an MRI guided biopsy. I'm really frustrated that I have to go through this again because of their error; not to mention the cost associated. Has anyone else experienced this? Log in to post a reply",
