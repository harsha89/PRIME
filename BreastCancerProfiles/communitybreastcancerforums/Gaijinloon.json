    "Content": "Gaijinloon wrote: It has been just over a year since the surgery and we recently did a test which looked at many cancer biomarkers like CA19-9, CEA, CA125, and CA72-4. Most we low risk or normal but CA72-4 was crazy high, and the oncologist won't look at it, and I don't know what it means. I can't find studies or information about it that is clear.
