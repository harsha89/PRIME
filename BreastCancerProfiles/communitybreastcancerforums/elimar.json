Maybe you would feel more relaxed if you could get a friend or family member to go along with you for the imaging.  It is very normal to have anxiety about something like this.  Breast Cancer is scary.  Waiting to find out results is really nerve wracking.   I hope you don't have to wait too long and that it turns out B9.  Good Luck!",

The radiologist may be able to narrow that down to a more likely range when he studies it.  I don't know if waiting six months or three months for another diagnostic mammo would be an option?  It would be more telling, though, any changes that occured in that short of time as compared to the span of eight long years.",

A mammo did not find my lump, I did, but for many the opposite is true...nothing can be felt, but then something shows up on the image.  If something is found before symptoms occur, hopefully it means it is earlier stage and a woman may not need as much surgery or treatment and have good odds of survival.  I guess I am commenting from an early detection standpoint, and why not catch it early when there is less liklihood of lymph/vascular invasion.  Most would wish to avoid Stage IV if possible, I'm sure of that.",

I had a benign lump at age 21.  My doc responded right away, first telling me that the vast majority of lumps turn out to be benign, then scheduling an excisional biopsy (as they did back then.)   Even tho' it was not likely to be cancer, no one took it lightly until cancer was definitely ruled out.",

While she is this weak, chemo could do more harm than good.  Usually chemo does offer some continued protection for a few months after stopping, so taking a two month break is not really a disadvantage.  Besides chemo knocking out those WBC's, over time it can belabor the muscle of the heart (especially in elderly) which then leads to CHF (congestive heart failure.)  When that happens, fluid will collect in the lungs and make it easier for pneumonia to set in.  Did you notice swelling in your mom's feet or ankles?  Sometimes that is one of the most visible signs.  If that is a part of your mom's condition it would be more reason to take a break. Was her RBC also low?  That can make her feel exhausted, tired all the time. It is important for her to get nutrition, and that is hard especially with bowel trouble.  Has she tried the Ensure drink?  The nutrients and calories are more easily absorbed from it than from some solid foods.  My mom used this for a couple years.  Although she lost weight while hospitalized, she never lost another pound after that in over a year while I was her caregiver.  I really feel that drink helped.  Boost is another brand.  Pain is one thing that should be and can be managed!!!  Somebody (the doc!) is dropping the ball on that one.  With so many pain meds. available, your mom should not have to suffer.  Can she tolerate the opioid drugs?  (Hydrocodone?  Oxycodone?)  Both are ofen formulated together with Tylenol for extra pain relief.  You can get it in liquid or tablet form.   Finally, I think the doc who commented, \"we don't know what will happen,\" is a) being honest; and b) giving her a chance to regain her strength to possibly get back on some kind of chemo.  It may work out that way.  If she continues to weaken, it would be hard to put her through more chemo and doing so could actually shorten her days.  When treatment permanently stops, it is time for hospice. It does not mean \"the end.\"  It does mean living out the rest of her time (and no one really knows how long) as comfortable as possible, without having to traipse around to doctor's offices because the nurse comes to you, plus counselors, aides, whatever.  I found hospice to be a positive experience. As a caregiver, remember to take care of yourself too. ",

My own experience was a small IDC tumor, with adjacent radial scarring.  Because of dense breast tissue, none of it was recognized on mammo.  I could feel the IDC lump and US confirmed it.  No one even knew of my radial scars until my final pathology following surgery.   They were tiny too.  It was all taken out.  I hope.  ",

Although I am far from passive, at times I felt less like I was battling and more like the battlefield!  In a slightly different take than skylotus (above,)  I felt like cancer was in my body doing bad things, and chemo was also in my body doing bad things, (but maybe killing off some cancer cells in the process); and all I could do was stand by.  In that sense, I am not fighting cancer, I'm the ring (or octogon) that is being fought in. At least the term \"fight\" or \"battle\" doesn't trivialize our experiences with cancer.  I might be branded a hypocrite because I have probably uttered the phrase more than once myself, but I don't care for \"cancer journey\" because, to me, going on a journey (travelling) has always been a fun adventure.  That sure does not describe cancer!    Finally, Boo123, short of cancer being prevented/cured, I will always think of it as something scary and aggressive no matter what terms get applied to it..",

Also, in all my Googling, I remember seeing something about the effects of radiation to the lung worsening over a year's time.  I mean if you got a lung x-ray right after rads, you might not notice much difference in how the lung looks; but if you x-rayed the same lung a year after rads, you could easily see the damage caused by the rads. I don't know if any of you ASKED your doctors HOW MUCH of your lung was getting zapped.  I was \"disturbed\" to find out they were hitting 20% of mine.  I threw a minor fit and the doctor was able to reduce that to 12-13% by blocking the lung off a little more.  That still seems like way too much, but in rads treatment the attitude is like, \"Ho-Hum, that kind of collateral damage is just an everyday occurence around here.\"  I guess that's why I am always going on about \"better treatments\" because if the best they can do is also ruining ~10% of your lung, that is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH.",

Right now, I have a FA in one breast, very small.  My radiologist asked me if I would be comfortable monitoring it with US every six mos.  She did not seem very worried.  I was o.k. with \"watch and wait.\"  It has been followed for about 2 yrs. with no change at all.  I'm not a doctor, or a know-it-all, but when the docs lean toward thinking it is cancer, they shift into a totally different gear.  Trust me on that observation.  Good Luck tomorrow morning!",

Look, despite what your BRCA test comes back as, having that much family history probably does increase your risk.  Having dense breasts does increase your risk.  Having previous benign growths (the fibroadenoma) slightly increases your risk.  In some cases, calcifications are linked with breast cancer but not always.  Once you do get your test results back, why not go over the info. once again to get a clear understanding of what your actual risk is at that point?  You certainly have time to read and research and discuss more about your options, to make informed decisions.  At the very least, you do need to be very vigilant with your future screenings.   I can tell you that my first question for the doc would be, what is going on with the two nodes that were mentioned in the imaging report?  If they looked abnormal for some reason, I'd want to know why.",

From ACS, pertaining to risk of future BC: Women diagnosed with certain benign breast conditions might have an increased risk of breast cancer. Some of these conditions are more closely linked to breast cancer risk than others. Doctors often divide benign breast conditions into 3 general groups, depending on how they affect this risk. Non-proliferative lesions: These conditions are not associated with overgrowth of breast tissue. They do not seem to affect breast cancer risk, or if they do, it is to a very small extent. They include: Mastitis (infection of the breast) is not a lesion, but is a condition that can occur that does not increase the risk of breast cancer. Proliferative lesions without atypia: These conditions show excessive growth of cells in the ducts or lobules of the breast tissue. They seem to raise a woman's risk of breast cancer slightly (1½ to 2 times normal). They include: Proliferative lesions with atypia: In these conditions, there is an overgrowth of cells in the ducts or lobules of the breast tissue, with some of the cells no longer appearing normal. They have a stronger effect on breast cancer risk, raising it 3½ to 5 times higher than normal. These types of lesions include:",

What did seem odd was a surgeon telling you: ...he even states that my breast are extremely dense & that I have a 25% chance of this fibroadenoma converting into CA at a later date... The one is not known for converting to the other, although I have heard that women who are capable of growing certain(*) benign lesions in their breasts were more likely to grow cancer at some point.  I did hear that fibroademonas can \"hide\" a cancercerous tumor on imaging, if they arise side by side, so that the cancer has a chance to get quite large before it is discovered. You are right that it is possible for a biopsy to collect only benign cells and miss cancerous ones, but I don't think it is very probable because usually the samples are taken from 4-6 different locations.  You could have the fibroadenoma removed, as sarajane7374 suggested, and take that out of the equation. Also, I'm not saying not to keep pursuing a diagnosis of what is going on with you because remarks about nodes, bleeding for 18 days, low ferritin with anemia, and elevated WBC do indicate that things aren't right.  Really hope you can get to the bottom of it.

BTW, everyone seems to love the \"crap shoot\" analogy, which I don't care for much.  (I get reminded too much of a bad production of \"Guys and Dolls\" every time I hear the expression.)  I am going to confess suggesting the \"coin toss\" analogy to Barbe, so if anyone is going to pick that apart, you can direct that to the right source but I must tell you I will probably continue using that phrase myself and might even popularize it.  Out with the old, in with the new.

A mitotic rate of 3 signifies the most rapid rate of growth. Since rapidly dividing cells are the most susceptible to chemo, this certainly should be a consideration when you and the doc discuss chemo. While your Onco score came back low, I agree with the person who wrote that that the low score should not override all of the other indications that point toward you doing the chemo. Personally, although I am usually a less is more person, I would probably do the 4 rounds (and that is the least given as treatment) if I had the pathology that you have. Afterward, you will have a second line of defense by going on an anti-hormonal drug. In that way, you will cover as many bases against a recurrence that you can. That is about all a person can do. And stay vigilant. By the way, with clean margins on each surgery, logic does seems to point to them being separate.",

Glad I came by to read the \"B/C journey\" posts.  re: a journey suggests it is one that you've opted to undertake, not one that makes you feel like you've just been shot out of a cannon and now you've landed on some parallel pink planet. Mini1, that is just hilarious and too true!!! But it is hard to refer to everything without some kind of dorky label, isn't it?  I say stuff like, \"that year I had my cancer.\"  And my inner voice hollers, \"Oh, aren't you optimistic that you got rid of it all?\" And Mini, I always thought the realist says, \"Well, it's not gonna get filled again, so I may as well drink the rest of it!\" And I say, \"What glass?  I'm chugging straight from the bottle.\"  Humor-ist.",

From what you wrote, you won't be getting mammograms, and may or may not get ultrasound.  This could depend on where your tumor had been located, or factors individual to you.  You should be getting the clinical breast exam every six months, for at least a couple years (but the length of time varies from doc to doc on this also.) The ODDS on your cancer returning is LOW.  How low?  I heard about 2-5% for mastectomy.  Can't be more reassuring than that, and you will by now have noticed that the docs don't hand out guarantees to any of us.  I do know what you mean about being pushed aside, since you were in the \"lucky\" early-stage group.  I swear, the nurse that gave me my early-stage Dx was practically smiling when she told me.  Hip, hip hooray, right?  (But I do understand how delivering that message is a lot more hopeful than telling someone they are Stage IV, so I get it.)  It's hard to convince someone as newly diagnosed as yourself, that it is possible for the day to come when you will not even think about cancer once.  I don't mean forget it, but just not give it the time of day.  It takes time to get to that point, but that is the horizon we all look toward.",

Happy B-Day grannydukes, a day late.  I was just reading about your most special Hallowen treat this year...Congrats! Here's my little rant:  We've all come across talk, articles and threads on here about changing diet and lifestyle since getting a B/C diagnosis.  Well, maybe I am just stubborn or lazy or both, but I haven't hopped on the bandwagon on all that change.   First of all, the only risk factors I had were kids at a later age and taking BC pills for some years.  Well, that's in the past, so I can't change those risk factors now.  I'm fit and at a healthy weight, but I cannot afford the cost of a 100% organic lifestyle.  Should I change my diet because of studies out now, that could be reversed in a couple more years when another costly study is done on the same nonsense?   (How many times has caffiene gone from good-bad-good-bad?  I've lost track!)   What should I eat this week? So, second, not knowing what brought on my B/C, should I just guess what needs to be changed?  That does not make sense to me.   Third, radiation (the kind from our treatments and all those mammos) is known to cause cancer, well, the mutation of cells anyway.  I don't see anyone in a big rush to change that part of our lifestyles.  Everytime I go for mammo (and the squisher broke my blood vessels the last two times on my treatment side) and then they need \"extra views\" with more radiation bombardment, I wonder if I am doing more harm than good.   And this they tell me I need. Love how B/C brought its own special confusion into my life.",

This is a good question for Mx.  In the case of Lx, they generally radiate the area so it is not as much an issue if the radiation does the job of killing off strays left behind.

I had SNB at time of surgery, but was awake for the shot of radioactive tracer.  That hurt.  Ask if they can give you something (topical or local) so you don't feel this sting.  For me, the SNB surgical site hurt more after the surgery, mainly 'cause they might have to go digging thru' some muscle to get to the nodes.  Then, as you heal, the scar tissue in the underarm area can feel tight when you move your arm.  It's not that painful, about at the level of a couple tylenol. Good luck with the re-excision and SNB.  It should not be took much different than the lumpectomy you have already had.",

I've had two excisional biopsies (old school, before core and needle biopsies were the rage, and one is a scar like yours) and one lumpectomy.  No difference until all the additional stuff that came following the lumpectomy.  Don't worry too much for now and good luck on results day!",

How will I feel if chemo gives me neuropathy, a weakened heart muscle, etc. for the rest of my life.  How will I feel if I get CHF or an infection I can't fight off because of low WBC? What I am saying is that, of course, if anyone skipped chemo and got recurrence, they would feel bad and like they made the wrong choice.  And, of course, if someone did chemo and they now have chronic pain or had a heart attack, they would feel bad, like they, too, made the wrong decision.  The hindsight would be 20/20 in either case, but making the decision up front is very difficult.

Mini1,  As far as one arm being bigger than another, we ALL have slight variations, usually with our dominant arm being slightly bigger, but sometimes the reverse.  If you go to a Lymphedema therapist, they will take baseline measurements, not to compare one arm to the other, but to compare the arm to itself over time to see if there is enlargement (poividing you don't have an overall weight gain.)   You could take your own baseline measurement at home, if you aren't working with a therapist.  purple32, I'm sorry my comment rubbed you the wrong way.  I am not even quite sure why, since I wrote that I was not making a judgement statement, but you seem to be insisting that I am.  If you re-read my comment, I did not compare LE to any cancer stage, not did I imply a contest.  ??  If you want to explain exactly what you mean in a PM, I might better understand.  As it is, I really do not understand.",

There is probably not a woman here who was \"prepared\" to deal with a B/C diagnosis, but when the time came we were all ready to give it our best shot at getting rid of the cancer or getting it under control.  Your mom can do this too.  Your mom is lucky that you are there right beside her and finding things out for her benefit, and giving her support.",

I am very fond of telling others that they should and must be their own advocates, or have an interested loved one speak up for them.  You simply cannot hand the reins over to the \"healthcare team.\" because you can't know where their interests lie.  Am I being paranoid?  Annettek has just illustrated the point that sometimes you might be urged to be a part of someone's pet project or special interest, without them being up front about it.  So sorry you had to get the extra CT rads exposure, annettek.  I am always fearful of that myself.  (One of the low points of my treatment was getting a set of preliminary CTs for a Mammosite that ended up not happening.  Not really the docs fault, other than they made a bad guess that I would be a good candidate but I was not.  To them, it's just a tiny bit more radiation--no biggie--but it's my body so I'll be the judge of that.))",

The thing about rads is, the better your overall health, the better you can withstand yet another onslaught to your body.  You sound like you have energy to burn, girl, so you may not get too fatigued at all.  Remember to get a lot of protein in your diet during the rads time (even having those drinks, like Ensure) because it helps the good tissue repair itself from the rads damage.  Also, you seem like the type person who would want to know how much collateral damage your lung is going to get, so you might want to ask your RO about that.  Twenty percent of my one lung was in the rads field...one pitched fit later, the RO got it down to about 13%.  Good Luck!",

The sentinel nodes are also in the breast/armpit area.  All they are, are the first ones in line for the drainage channels away from your tumor area.  You might be thinking of some women saying they got a tracer shot near the areaola, but that would only be if their tumor were near to it.  The tracer gets injected at the site of the tumor bed and it follows the lymph channels from there. curve, I got seven surprise/uninvited titanium clips in my node area.  All for two nodes.  Well, mine were not \"markers,\" but the clips to cut the blood supply to the vessels in the area, although they certainly do mark the area.  I'm skinny and I can feel them under there.  I hate 'em.",

That said, it really is all in the perspective.  On this thread, LE can be one of our most dreadful worries (second to the cancer returning?)  Go read on a Stage IV thread and it's a lot lower on the list of worries there.  Fretting over LE is actually a luxury of being an early-stager.  I'm not being judgmental, I'm just sayin'. Personally, I am three years out and feel that my lymph system has repaired some of the old and established new drainage channels.  I don't have lymphedema and think my risk to get it in the future is very low.   Not non-existent, just very low.  I have had one blood draw on my treatment side (probably just to live dangerously) but I don't plan to make it a habit.  I DID have \"surgical edema\" in my chest and boob area after surgery.  I went for a few PT sessions after rads, to prevent scar adhesions and the PT also did the lymph draining strokes on me then.  I did the massage at home a lot during the first 6-8 mos. too.  Who knows if that helped, but I don't think it would hurt if women were instructed to do the lymph drainage massage, just to help move the fluid around after surgery, as a measure of prevention of LE.  I do know that if the channels and tissues get \"stretched out\" by full blown LE, it is much harder to reverse it than it is to prevent it from happening in the first place. p.s. Meece,  I think, with 16 nodes out like you, I would remain cautious.  And, since you have no LE, you must have SUPER NODE 17 in there somewhere, or something!!! -------------- Where is that Ms. Sheila, anyway?",

I'm no doctor, just taking a guess really, but I'm glad you will be seeing one soon.  You will most likely get a diagnostic mammogram as well as a diagnostic ultrasound.  These tests can reveal the characteristics of the lump and suggest malignant or benign, but only a biopsy will give you the definitive answer.  I had my fibroadenoma before the advent of the core needle biopsy, so I had an excisional biopsy in which the entire lump was removed.  If I were in your situation, and if it is not an infection, I would bypass a core needle biopsy (and that is because I personally do not care for them) and just get the lump out.  Even if it is B9, it is better to be out.  For one thing, it is hurting you and for another, by leaving it in it will create an area that could mask the growth of something malignant in the future.  I'm not saying it will turn into cancer, just that it will make the area harder to image. Finally, it's natural to worry, but from what you have described I wouldn't jump straight to the cancer conclusion.  I'm going to hope that your results are benign.  Good Luck on Monday!",

ConnieGreene,  What perplexes me about your B/C situation is that it is Grade 3, which does indicate a more aggressive growth, and so chemo may do some good.  If I were in your situation, I believe I would get the Onco Test.  Of course you may get a score on that that falls into an inconclusive range.  That happens too.  Also, I see you changed your Dx, but people usually to not indicate size by the whole area covered by the DCIS.  Your new Dx isIDC and whatever size that is.  But I also wanted to ask, since you have extensive DCIS, are you going for mastectomy then?  One or both, or have you not decided yet?  Or is lumpectomy still an option?  I am not all that familiar with the DCIS experience.  (Final note:  Don't worry if you don't understand what I write to the others.  Ignore it for now.)

All these interactions are established and clinically important and concurrent therapy requires close monitoring of the INR. Tamoxifen and warfarin is the commonest combination seen in practice and dose reductions of warfarin of 30\u201350 % or more are sometimes required. So, that flat out says Tamox. and warfarin are used together, but it could be in the case where someone is already on warfarin and then needs hormonal therapy, at which point they need a dose reduction of the warfarin.   But is it ever acceptable once a person had a DVT?  Krystyna, your doc said no.  Now, my friend will have to raise that question to her doc next week.  She has not asked yet since Faslodex was the plan up til now.",

The women at more potential risk (if the guidelines do change) are the 40-50 group, with little or no risk factors or histories who, as WE know, can get cancer anyway.  A mammo could be their only hope at early detection.   In my case, the mammos didn't matter.  I was faithful about following the current guidelines, but had to do all the work and find the lump myself anyway.  To me, the article is most disturbing in that the Task Force recommends against self-exams claiming they have no value.  WTH!

I agree that we never again feel truly free from it, and I am mentally putting it in a little pink box and storing it way back in the cobweb corner of my mind.  Of course when it's time to get a new screening or something, the fear factor returns.  I've got that coming up in a couple weeks. I was writing another post about the \"cancerversary\" and I realized then that I consider myself cancer-free now and until the time they tell me otherwise.  I have to think of it that way to keep my sanity. I know that this may be a moronic analogy, but I've been in a car accident or two.  (Not my fault people.)  Still every day I get behind the wheel and drive without actual fear.  The roads are more crowded these days and my reaction time is not as quick as in my youth, so maybe my odds for a collision are worse, but I do what I can do to be safe and go about my business.  That's me and B/C as well.",

When I get a chance I will check on the Red Cross site.  I know when you donate, you disclose all relevant diseases you may have had, and they must have a good screening process otherwise they would have refused to take blood from you.  I used to give occasionally.  If it is allowed, I don't mind giving again.  I have a blood type they really like too.",

My oldest friend, who began as Stage III went to Stage IV this past summer when multiple bone mets were found.  She got rads to a few of the mets, then went on Tamoxifen maintenance.  She was on Tamox. for four months (with her TMs going from 200+ down to 100+ down to double digits) when she got a pain in her calf that turned out to be phlebitis.  When they checked that with US, they found a DVT in her groin area. So, now, she is off the Tamox., on warfarin for at least six mos. and doc mentioned a med that would be an injection (Faslodex?) Now here's my question:  Did any taking Tamox., who had a problem with getting a blood clot EVER return to taking Tamox. once the clot was resolved? I ask this because she was having such success with the Tamoxifen, we were hoping she could maintain on that for some years.  If you post a reply here, could you write about the treatment option you switched to after going off the Tamoxifen as well?  Thanks! (BTW, my friend progressed to Stage IV while on Arimidex, so docs feel that is not an option for her now.)

Still hoping to hear, first-hand, of a similar experience.  Third time's the charm.  Anyone?",

IRL, I know of one person who got Dx at 35, took Tamox. for 11 mos., got a clot and came off Tamox.  She never went back on it, then 6 years later had recurrence and got treatment for it, after which time she was put back on Tamox. and had no bad side effects.  What I don't know was whether she was also given an anticoagulant along with it, or what kind of monitoring she got. I feel really crushed if Tamox. is off the table forever for my friend because it got her TMs down to almost normal range.  I was hoping that she could be one of the people to keep her bone mets in check for years on Tamoxifen alone, as it has been with some of the BCO members.",

Maybe the best you can do is to encourage her to at least do some follow-up, just for general health reasons and because the routine blood screenings can often indicate if something is awry.  A number of women who have surgery alone do survive.  A number of women who \"do everything possible\" do not.  You just never know which way the cookie is gonna crumble.  Good luck to you and your friend. ",

Also, something that really helped me when my body was starting to get beat down by rads, I asked for a Monday off so I could have an extra recovery day long weekend.  One extra day off really did help.  (I had one of those for Labor Day too -- nice)   My Rad-Onc. was just fine with that.  I know they give women up to a week off if the skin really starts to suffer, so why not ask for a long weekend if you are super sore or tired?  I did & it felt great.",

Bottom line, I don't know if there is any rhyme or reason who gets the rads burns.  Make sure to use a good lotion.  I used aloe.  Even if you get skin issues, remember that many women here got through that and you will also.  Best of Luck to you!",

I also don't like having to accept the\"self\" with FM.  It does not feel like the real me, even after having it for over five years.",
