Thanks again; I so appreciate this Board.  This is my first day posting and I have been going a bit crazy w/ questions - but I hope to \"give back\" to others, once things have calmed down. Enjoy the day, llb",

I have a friend who developed LE in her leg, requiring daily attention. My PT seems to not want to scare me - as I had expressed my concerns fairly strongly.  That being said, she has asked a LE specialist to meet with me tomorrow. So I am pleased that she is so proactive (confirming what you said). Thanks again for your response (and support!)  Your LE sounds like it started in your arm;  mine is in my chest and back.  I wonder if mine will then move to my arm.  Remains to be seen.  I need to stop worrying!  It is not a negative path. result, eh?
