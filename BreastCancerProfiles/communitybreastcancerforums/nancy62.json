Seems so silly to say that, I constantly feel like I have a very tight bra on when I don't even have one on . My feet are numb but yet I feel pain . I want to stop the arimidex,but I'm afraid why can't I just say to hell with it . I talk to myself and say nobody knows if these miracle drugs will really work. My walk reminds me of Herman munster(from the munsters)like I have 2 bricks at the end of my legs. You know enough about me I'm tired of complaining.",
