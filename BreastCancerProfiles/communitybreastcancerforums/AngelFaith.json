I am paranoid about cancer too I understand how you feel. Just because u have pain does not even close to indicate metastatic bc. Take a deep breath, relax. Easier said than done I know, just have it checked out and be persistent if they tell u it's nothing. Hugs to you.",

After it was obviously not a plugged duct I went to my ob an a general surgeon who said it would probably resolve itself. Never really told me what it was because he said I'd have to stop nursing to biopsy it. Which was devastating to me as I wanted to nurse so bad. I'm currently at 13 months still nursing. But it resolved within a week or two. I think it was a galactocele... I hope that's all it was. I'm on this site now because my mom was dx with bc this summer and I currently am having breast pain. Like lightning bolt pains. In the left breast and sometimes the right. My breasts have changed shape and size dramatically over the year and I don't know what's normal. Definitely see your doctor and demand imaging. Probably n ultrasound as you're young and it's not radiation like a mammogram (a known carcinogen). The odds are on our side since we're younger and have small babies, but it is important to follow up. Please let me know how it goes. Im seeing my ob tmro and demanding an ultrasound. I've heard they don't want to do imaging until your done nursing for at least 6 months but im going to demand it anyway. Good luck! Sending benign vibes your way!! Cassi",
