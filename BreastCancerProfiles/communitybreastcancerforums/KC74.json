I underwent a bilateral mastectomy on 1/26/18. I also had the Onco type testing and was deemed fairly low risk for reoccurrence, but due to the size of my tumor (6.8 cm), they recommended chemo. I started treatment on 3/8. My treatment is every 3 weeks for 6 months for a total of 8. I've completed 2 so far. I'm on Methotrexate, Fluorouracil, and Cyclophoshamide. I was told by my doctor that I might experience hair thinning, but should not have full hair loss. Is there anyone out there that has done this treatment and can give me an idea what I should expect?
