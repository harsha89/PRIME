I haven't heard from anyone who went through this while they had cancer.  Is Elizabeth Edward and me the only ones?  God I hope so.  It's sucks.",

It is been 2.5 yrs.  I have tried to be my happy postive self.  I have 3 kids.  I found out my husband was having an emotional affair with a woman at work.  Who I was friendly with.  She was very supportive sending cards all the time.  Caught him lying he bought her a Tiffany ring(for being such a good friend).  They are just friends he would say.  Tried to make me like I am crazy.  He works 24hr once a week at a hospital.  Caught her sneaking there to see him.  Big scene.  Like cheaters.  Ha Ha!!  She asked him if he was still in love with me.  He said yes.  He asked for another chance.  Stupid me allowed it.  I am going through so much and didn't want to put my kids through more stress.  So now I worry about dying and leaving my kids and my husband going to work and seeing her. I don't trust him at all. He says they don't talk at all only if have to for work.  Not sure I believe that.  All he is worried about is himself.  I need some advice.  What would you do in my shoes?
