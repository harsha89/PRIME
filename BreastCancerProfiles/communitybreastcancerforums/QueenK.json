In my case, I waited 3 months for a consult to get the duct that was BLEEDING removed.Much of my time was spent waiting in the year it took me to get diagnosed.I waited for path results, am now waiting to get the BRCA test.The BRCA test was ordered in JULY and I am finally getting the blood drawn in FEBRUARY.And I am a person that has breast cancer,I may have messed up my chances of having reconstruction if I get a mast if the test is +..which brings me to.... I was told if I wanted a Mast, that I could not get immediate reconstruction because they would not be able to get a PS and a surgeon together OR I could wait 4 months. Anyway, I also don't agree.

She is also in her early 30's.I am not knocking anyone on here,I have no idea of your ages but as someone diagnosed with breast cancer just out of my 20's I can tell you I was VERY angry.I had to make the decision as to try to have children, would I see them grow up, would I live until my 35th birthday? I have not been through as much as some of you, but please this is not a \"whos a hero competition\" I had virtually no support...from friends, barely any from family.I had 2 surgeries in 6 weeks, radiation and now??? I have been told I am cancer free.I certainly hope I am not being naieve in saying I will not die of breast cancer.Truth be told, no one was there when her Dr and her discussed things, no one knows her prognosis, or how serious her cancer was. By documenting my struggle above,I in no way compare myself to anyone else.We each struggle, and we each deal with it in our own way. Myself, I had had some complications, so no matter how \"easy\" my journey and radiation may have seemed to some of you..I can tell you its not.There are some people such as myself who don't \"go into the office daily\" and I am OK with that...anyway....",

Things like duct ectasia are quite common in older woman, as told to me by my surgeon.A papilloma is also possible as well.So yes \"they\" can say chances are its not cancer.But in reality in MY situation I was told by an oncologist that these are symptoms of cancer and not the other 2 conditions listed. 1.Bloody nipple discharge that comes out on its own. 2.nipple discharge from ONLY one nipple. 3.Yellow, brown and eventually red. the ONLY reason I am saying this, is you have to be pro active.Please know that I did have an ok mammogram, an okay ductogram and an ok ultrasound.They where all perfectly fine. There is a fine line between being really freaked out, and being rational.I was misdiagnosed for a whole year.I am not saying these things to frighten you, but I did not know until I had it removed, no lump, no anything.",
