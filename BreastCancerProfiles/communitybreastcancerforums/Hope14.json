Im a small woman and my breasts are large for my size and always gave me beck/ back pain and always caused me discomfort..i am cup D . I kept delaying and delaying being scared from an invasive surgery/ pain. Etc.  Last summer i was diagnosed with bc in my right breast. Had lumpectomy and rads. Now im still considering breast reduction eventhough i lost lots of weight. My breasts seem to never change in size. I wonder if i can still have reduction after rads on the rt side and im considering reduction as i believe they take lots of tissus of the breast to reduce the size?? So if any risk of recurrence or invasive bc in the future my dense breasts wont let me miss or diacover late any lumps?? Any feedbacks are greatly appreciated to help me make the right decision.

After I had right lumpectomy on September 2013.  I had 10 days ago cough with phlegm that turned out to be radiations pneumonitis. It was really bad however I'm recovering now... Yesterday I had a mammogram+ ultrasound to both my breasts as I expressed to my doctor that I'm experiencing pain in the left \"good breast\". The technician took pictures then she took me back for more pictures of the left breast which got me really nervous and she said\" we can see change in your breast tissue and we will need more pictures and the dr will talk to you\". They hen took me to the ultrasound. I can see the technician taking measurements of what  I see a dark oval spot. It got me so nervous seeing that spot that I phoned my husband to come to the imaging centre... The radiologist then came and told me we can see a \"cyst\" and because we know you are very anxious after what you experienced in your right breast we will send you for a biopsy!!!! He said cysts are mostly Benin but we just want to make sure.... I sure agreed and they set the biopsy date to May 27. I was still ok til the family doctor phoned me today to update me about my chest X-ray which as I said is radiations pneumonitis ,then he said they received the mammogram report and that I have a \" fibroadenoma\" in my left breast that needs to be assessed. He told me not to worry even though I have all my reasons to be after all what I went thru. But view the history of my BC in my right breast they need to be cautious and assess this \" fibroadenoma \" which is mostly \" Benin\".   I feel so nervous now..after hanging up with dr.lagios who was very reassuring,I get the scare again about that \" fibroadenoma \" and a new biopsy in less than a year..,in less than a year lots have been going on,Dcis,lumpectomy,severe reactions to radiations,aches and pain,fatigue,radiations pneumonitis and now this new\" fibroadenoma\".  I don't know I feel my head is spinning. And I cannot concentrate. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated please......
