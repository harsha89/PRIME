Whether chemo or RT, they should weigh benefits against drug side effects. Maybe in your case the side effects outrisk the benefits and that is why the RO and the MO counsel against it. Anyway, I asked my MO to talk about the drugs used in chemo and I didn't like the temporary and permanent side effects of them. You may too and check on the interactive and adverse side effects of these in lupus. As in sarahrae's case, my MO decided to change his opinion regarding chemo from no-chemo to yes-chemo because I have positive lymph nodes (two in the supracavicular area and one in the axilla). I was furious with him because the score didn't change. The thing is that I am totally adamant to receive it. I have a score of 26, in the intermediate region of the Oncotype graph, and a new MO I was sent too for a second opinion told me she wanted to make a new analysis (this time is Mammaprint) because this one has low and high scores, no intermediate ones. I told her she could make it but I wouldn't change my mind about chemo. The Oncotype graph only shows approximately an eight percent (8%) decrease in the probability of getting a recurrence with chemotherapy (in my immediate future, I will make the interpolation to calculate the exact percentage). Anyway, I am not ready to go thru a whole, not even partial chemotherapy, because chemo has strong side effects that I cannot deal now because I am 66 and working with a foot fracture and osteoporosis. I need to be as strong as I can get to reduce the risks of falling or fainting while on therapy. To help me decrease the percentage of recurrence, besides hormone therapy, I will make changes in my life (less stress and good food and exercise) that I need. Hope you have made the decision that is best for you.",

I am scared and I wish not to be, of the process. I have many doubts myself and the RO that is attending is not an accessible person. What I have learned comes from people who has passed thru the therapy. Can you explain me why on earth do ROs continue to irradiate the skin even when the burn is visible? Why the protocol establishes 35-40 doses? Why don't you divide the radiation dose so you can finish when the burning of the skin is visble. In one of the patients' video I was seeing they used a gold mesh to cover the area to be irradiated \"to distribute evenly the heat\". The girl had a mastectomy on one breast but the mesh was applied on both. In my case, the left breast didn't show signs of cancer (MRI, PET/Scan, mammography, sono-mammography, etc) so I won't let any of the team do that on both breasts. I went to receive therapy for a breast with cancer, not to increase the probability to get cancer in the other breast. The PS told me that there is a possibility that the implant may get damaged with the irradiation. If the skin is damaged I will need to have a skin graft from another part of my body. That would mean another surgical intervention in this year (five on a row) and I am starting to hate this journey. Can you give me some news so that I can go there with a positive attitude and comply with most of the instructions? If I don't believe in a procedure, I won;t cooperate with it. I was preparing myself to stop the RT when the burn would begin to turn brown. As you clearly said, products for thermal burns do not help with radiation burns. Please help me since I rejected chemo and what I have seen and heard is making me also reject RT. The cancer was excised with the breast (clean margins). The only problem is that I had a one lymph node positive for cancer. Also PET/Scan showed activity in supraclavicular lymph nodes. I don't want lymphodema to develop in my right arm and the RT to the axilla increase the chance. ",

When I had the interview with the RO, she never told me about proton or photon radiation. But I know that now and I can choose. I hope they have the equipment so that I can make this decision. Even though proton radiation maybe problematic for the skin, I would choose it over the short and long term side effects of the photon beams. As Dragonsnake has pointed out, the photon passes thru skin, reaches other parts and burns them. The damage is more general. I will have reconstruction of the breast after I finish it and I let the PS use some of the skin of the left breast. And even though, the radiation team will protest, I will ask for the protection around my thyroid because I don't need rad there. Thank you for the information. I will look for info about the proton and photon rads and the equipment that produce them. And if I have to change the center, I will look for the less damage to myself. ",

I haven't started yet my RT because the RO told me to finish with the implant and then go back. She won't touch me before the PS. I am scared that the implant might get damaged with the RT but the PS says then he would put on a new one and get a skin graft for the damaged skin in the reconstructed breast. The breast with a TE hurts like hell and I haven't started RT. I cannot imagine the hurt associated with RT but twice in my life I had burns under the axilla because of the spray deodorant. I will talk to the RO and tell her to reduce the number of rad doses. By what I have seen, the burns start by # 20. If I get a severe burn, I will not let them treat me until the pain in the skin ameliorates. By what I read, the skin hurts so much with RT that is difficult to wear a bra. Walmart and Kmart have some sports bra with front closure you may wear. To help yourself buy them larger that your size. I am making myself some bras when I get there with soft tissue inside and cotton in the outside and velcro for closure. You can look at some blogs on how to sew homemade bras. I am also crocheting some false boobs with a soft baby material to send them to women who can't afford to buy bras with prosthetic. Since the material is so soft, I might crochet some super soft bras for myself. I have two MOs, one OS (oncology surgeon), one RO, and one PS and have told them all I need a bra with prosthetic and none of them have sent the darn medical order with the justification to the health plan. So I changed my opinion and decided to have an implant. I see that you will have a LD flap reconstruction. That is exactly the kind of flap my PS will use if radiation damage the skin and the implant. I am not so sure that is good for me because I don't want to develop lymphedema. Anyway, I have two months to think about it. You really have a good attitude about the whole thing. That is good; it'll make you heal faster and better. I read the book \"Anatomy of an illness\". You should read it. I liked your experience at the cafeteria. Since June, I have been at the Auxilio Mutuo Hospital almost every day and they have not given me even the thanks for sponsoring them. Next time I will ask for discount on the OR fees. Bye, dear, hope to hear from you soon.",

However, most of you have been in the OR about three to four months after Dx. All my procedure lasted eight months. I had my biopsy on April 28 and the positive results three weeks later (that was one of the reasons I changed doctor). I went to see the BS on June 1 and the MO on June 2. The BS gave me Arimidex to reduce the tumor for 26 days and I was operated on June 27; I was sent to RO en July 12. The RO sent me to PS to get TE or implants. I saw PS by the end of July and he sent me to OR on August 4. Since I read that implants get damaged by RT, I decided to get TE and leave the implants's surgery after RT. He sent me back to RO on October and back to OR for final implants on Dec. 8. Not finished yet. The transplanted nipple skin died and fell out. Not scared. The rest of the skin is fine. Ps is checking every two weeks. By the way, if I have a recurrence on my right breast or if I get a lump in the left one I will be getting a mastectomy on left and will ask PS to take out the implant on right. The TE surgery was so painful I won't pass thru that again. I got capsular contracture on TE and it seems to be coming back with implant. So I prefer to get it out than to be on the OR every six to eight months to be cleaned and get a new implant. Maybe I was a little delayed on every procedure. Since I live alone I had to check on every aspect and see it covered. I needed to be sure what I wanted and looked for the information. I didn't want any regrets later on so I could not have any haste. I left my work finished before any new surgery. I was back on the job by Dec 24 but it was half holiday so I didn't have to go. One of you asked if she needed hospitalization after surgery. After MX, one night (that's what the health insurance plan authorizes). BS will put the JP drainage and send you home the day after if no complications arise. With TE, the PS will also use JP drainage and will hospitalize one night. Strangely, with implants no hospitalization even if one has drains. Every one of us has a different threshold for pain. I didn't need pain meds for biopsy, Mx, or final implants. As I said on a previous comment, you need a circle of friends or family to help you with everyday's chores. You need your food be supplied and someone to help you with hygiene since you will not shower until the doc says so. You will need to exercise after Mx or lumpectomy when the doc tells you. And last but not least, get prepared emotionally for your change in appearance. I didn't get depressed but sometimes I feel sad because I lost one breast. Still with my implant (left breast is bigger than the implant and I still feel lopsided), I feel differently and things have not got back into normalcy. The amount of medical appointments has decreased to an average of one per week though I had to add an orthopedic surgeon to my list of specialists because of fracture of right foot. Still having physical therapy. Our lives will be quasi-normal but it won't go back to what it was. As EastCoastTS said, we have to deal with what life brings us. So, dear ladies, God's blessings and best wishes for every one of you. Wishing you the best experience and the least discomfort to those undergoing surgery on this and following months. Maria",

He didn't tell me that it was going to hurt and I was not prepared. When I had to move away from bed or to the bathroom, I felt such stabbing pain and I had to bend myself. I didn't take the pain medications he gave me. Tylenol w/ codeine only gives me stomach ache and tramadol's side effect is hypotension. The night I was released from hospital I took half tramadol pill and in the morning I fainted. Since I didn't let him expand more than 200 cc and he filled a 100 cc on the time of the surgery, I had only one filling. I had two days of pain after that, and now if I don't make any undesirable motion, I don't have pain unless it is cloudy or rainy. The pain of the pectoral muscle subsided in intensity and in frequency for which I am really glad. I am noticing that I have a red line along the scar. It doesn't hurt because the area is numb, it is not hot but it is something new. Is that normal? You understood correctly. I still have my TE expanded but it doesn't hurt. I feel pressure but not pain. I am still in the evaluation phase for RT because when I read that in 40% of the cases implants get damaged with radiation, I decided to keep the TE and not having another surgery to change the implant. The problem is that I don't have the money to start radiation on the first place I was evaluated and I am looking for a second opinion (she will see me in Nov). This thing is delaying too much. Anyway, depending on what the new RO tells me, and if she considers all my petitions( no tattoos, no axillary irradiation, and shortening the number of sessions), I may have RT. If not, I am going back to the PS and finish the reconstruction. Good night, time to sleep cause I have to work tomorrow.",

I had the surgey f the biopsy and of the MX and they never hurt like this. I am getting used to it and sometimes it is softer than usual. I will be aware now of any complication of the final phase of reconstruction. My skin is hypersensitive and using a bra 24/7 is uncomfortable. I have been reading your posts and I remembered that my PS told me would use LD flap in case my skin was so damaged by radiation. I won't let him even if he is very good. Your comments are eye-opening. Besides I don't have much excess skin in my back. Anyway, I have enough skin from my tummy or he can use the excess part he is taking from my other breast. I didn't let him expand the TE more than 200 cc. More than 300 is too big for me and I want to get back to normal (I don't need a Las Vegas big boob).",
