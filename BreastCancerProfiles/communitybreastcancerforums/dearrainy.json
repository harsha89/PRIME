CO2 and chloride which have been off for a while, which everyone has been explaining away as from diarrhea, but he said it's actually from having trouble breathing, and it's a telltale sign of the problem. it was right under their noses the whole time. i felt like skipping out of his office. i have to wean off the drug, so i'll probably still feel shitty for a while, but still. today, i looked up the side effects, and there are TONS. but all of mine were there. why i got the ones that mimicked a serious disease, i will never know. just my body playing a fun joke, i guess. anyway, i thought you guys would get a kick out of the answer to the riddle. it was all from two little pills. amazing.",
