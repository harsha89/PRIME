Still applying the ice as my biopsied breast is still quite swollen. The pathology report will be in on Friday. My husband asked if it had grown since my last visit to which he was told no, that type doesn't grow quickly....which gave me the impression that my Radiologist already has a good idea of the type of cancer it is.",

My pulmonologist recommended that I get a PET Scan to help better determine what it was (it turned out to be an enlarged thymus gland). During the PET Scan, a nodule in my right breast was detected. It lit up 3x greater than the surrounding tissue. The pulmonologist sent me to an oncologist who reviewed the film and the report and gave me a breast exam where he felt the lump which is 1.8cm and about an inch to the right of the areola. He said that although PET Scans aren't definitive, the fact that the nodule absorbed so much glucose and lit up so brightly is a sign that it probably is cancer. I have a mammogram scheduled for next week. My question is, could a benign lump light up on a PET Scan? If so, what kinds of breast lumps/conditions absorb large amounts of glucose and trigger false positive PET Scan results?

      "Content": "Apr 13, 2015 04:32PM - edited Apr 13, 2015 10:18PM by chocomousse Thanks everyone for your optimism! Just back from the clinic. I had a mammogram followed by a sonogram. The results aren't good. The Radiologist stopped in afterward and said I have a cluster of calcifications which are suspicious for cancer based on the PET report, he didn't have the films. I have a biopsy scheduled for this Wednesday. My husband asked for a timeline as he just wants whatever it is removed. The Radiologist said that with a biopsy this Wednesday, they can have the results by Monday at the latest and if they are cancerous, I can be in surgery within 2 weeks getting either a lumpectomy or mastectomy with or without radiation and/or chemo. But he said everything at this point is speculation until the biopsy results are in. I asked him if he could tell the stage based on the imaging, he said no but thinks it's beyond stage 1 due to the shadowing of the calcifications. He also wants to examine the PET film to be sure there were no bright spots in my lymph nodes or elsewhere. I told him about the mass in my mediastinim which did illuminate which my Pulmonolgist thought was my Thymus gland instead of my lymph nodes. He seemed sceptical. The tech said they'd install a titanium chip inside my breast during the biopsy...I've never heard of that. The tech asked me again if I was sure there's no breast cancer in my family to which I said yes. As long as I avoid asking/wondering why this is happening, I won't get depressed so I'm really going to need to control how I process this over the next couple of weeks. To Fakeboobs, hoping your biopsy results are negative!",

      "Content": "May 6, 2016 09:47PM - edited May 6, 2016 09:48PM by chocomousse I posted first about the nagging pain on 11/6/15. My pain level then never exceeded a 5. By 11/21/15, my pain level had reached a 10. I have never felt pain that excruciating in my life. It felt like someone stuck a knife through my upper arm and left it sticking in the bone. It was searing, constant and completely debilitating. I was on pain medicine for another condition and doubled up on that which did absolutely nothing. I then tried extra strength aspirin guessing that since my nerve pain meds didn't help, maybe nerve damage wasn't the cause, maybe it was inflammation. So, I took an extra strength aspirin which surprisingly reduced the pain from a 10 to about an 8, not much but very significant when the pain is that intense. Since that helped a bit, I figured a stronger antinflammatory would help so I took an Aleve and got better relief. I continued taking the Aleve every 6 hours around the clock for the next 3 weeks just out of sheer fear that if I stopped, the pain would resume although I was able to move it again after about 5 days on the Aleve. I skipped a dose and noticed that the pain was pretty much gone so I don't know if what I experienced qualified as PMPS since that's caused by nerve damage. Whatever the culprit, the Aleve helped. After a couple of days on the Aleve, I had to take nausea meds because it killed my stomach but I got through it and as of today, I haven't had a recurrence. I'm more careful now to use that arm less and no longer keep it bent for long periods of time like when holding a phone to my ear. I use a head phone now when I need to use the phone. Keeping it straight as much as possible helps keep the pain at bay. ",

      "Content": "May 6, 2015 03:24AM - edited May 7, 2015 01:28AM by chocomousse I was confused about the lump that lit up in my PET scan too as I've been a vegetarian for most of my life and have none of the risk factors for BC. I've never weighed over 105 lbs, I've never used hormonal birth control, don't smoke although I was exposed to 2nd hand smoke until I was 23 from a parent, don't drink and have never used or tried drugs. I have, however, been exposed to a lot of radiation via xrays and various scans throughout my life for different medical conditions. I've also been prescribed a lot of antibiotics over my lifetime so while my lifestyle is healthy, I've been exposed to a lot of toxins. Someone implicated malnourishment and dehydration which also sound plausable in my case. I have struggled with deficiencies in B12, protein, potassium, magnesium and Iron throughout my life as well as a weak immune system. I've also had high copper and low zinc levels for most of my life. Another poster in this thread mentioned that they read that low vitamin D levels have been linked to BC but I took 4000 mg's of D3 for a year for uterine fibroids and 2 years later, I have DCIS. The D3 didn't shrink my fibroids at all. I'm no longer a vegetarian and now take Iron and an immune support vitamin. I also try to drink lemon water everyday. I have tumeric tea but read that the human body can't absorb most of the important stuff in it. I know that BC is found across the globe but its highest rates are among westerners so there is something about the things we're exposed to and/or ingest or are deficient in that's responsible.",
