It was explained to me that it takes time for the fluid to sort it out for themselves, in the meantime we need to give it a little helping hand.  If you are unwell and your temp reaches 40 celcuis (sorry, we deal in metric here) you need to contact someone - were you given a special phone number in emergencies - I was given a card which had instructions to any A&E  dept to follow, which stated I was a BC patient and the regimne they need to follow for your care.  Good luck and always listern to your body.  Go girl! ",
