I had a mastectomy so that would mean no boosts for me.   Regarding work, I am not physically or mentally ready to return.  I have been out on disability since I had the surgery in September.  My plan is to not return until after I've completed rads, hysterectomy/ooph, and exchange.  I am waiting to get the final confirm on Long Term Disability.  I don't want to go back to work and have to take time off again for those procedures - 4 weeks here or 2 weeks there.  I just want to be done with everything and transition back in smoothly. ",
