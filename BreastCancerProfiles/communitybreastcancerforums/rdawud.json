The procedure was similar to the original MRI except for a doctor will perform a detailed biopsy once the MRI is completed.  The biopsy is done while you are still on the MRI machine so they can accurately biopsy the area in question.  My results were benign. If you need more details let me know.  Stay Positive! Ro Ro",
