Was scary to start with as I did not know what it was. Went like yourself to a PE and she was brilliant. She taught me the logic of it and how to do the massage. She also put \"magic\" tape on it called kinesio tax. She cut it into strips and it went down my arm from my sholder. It looked like an octopus or a spider. On the funny side as it was summer I got a tan on the bits it did not cover so it was even stranger when the tape came off!!! The theory of the tape is that it cannels the small capilliaries in the right direction a bit like iron filings if you understand what I am trying to say. This treatment I had for about 2 months back in summer 06. I have not had any more treatment but I cannot say that it is not still there. it seems to come and go. if I am feeling well then it is not there but if I have a bug of virus it seems to flare up !!??!! However it is at the stage that I can put it out of my mind mostly.  Onto other news - had my 2 year check-up yesterday so all seems OK. Going on holiday two weeks today to Florida and St Lucia. Cannot wait - this was the main reason I could not come over in August. Hope you are all doing well Jill",

I am not sure if you are all communicating less (which seems a shame) or by a different means but I hope you are all doing well. We had a great holiday in Florida and the Carribean although it seems like an age ago now. I do not have much news - think that it a positive thing. On the subject of movies - I know we are always somewhat behind the States in these things but I would like to recommend Stardust to bring laughter to your lives. It is a PG(parental guidance) here so is suitable for all but the youngest kids. I went on Sunday and it made me laugh a lot. All the best Jill",

I know I have not been that great in keeping in touch but I suppose a periodic post is better than none. Things are fine here just now. I find the year end is a time for reflection and to be happy about all the good things that have happened or probably more importantly all the bad things that have not. Does that make sense? Anyway I hope someone who visits this site can pass on my good wishes to those who do not now. Best wishes Jill ",

Ravdeb - I am here on the board but they have not half made it difficult. I miss all your photo's - hope it is just a blip/computer error. Everything feels different - but i suppose we will all get used to it now they have allowed me to log on again. Anyway on a positive note I had a healthcheck today as it went as well as could be expected so that is good. I hope everyone has fully recovered from your holidays/weekend and I wish everyone the best Cheers Jill   ",
