The fatigue was difficult and I was moody. I never had a problem with nausea, the steriods caused some weight gain. Best of luck, I am also part of a online dating success story. I live in Minneapolis, have considered Mayo, but really love my cancer center and feel that I am getting top notch treatment. Marsha ",

I am now going to Herceptin only to see if that can hold the cancer at bay. Will be glad to be off the Taxol and Carbo, am going to a cabin with my daughters and sisters next week. In September I am going to California so I should feel great. Quick question how long until my hair starts to return?
