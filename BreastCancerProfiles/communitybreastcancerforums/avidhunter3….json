I am having a lumpectomy tomorrow for the breast duct (bleeding), the DR. seemed to think all was ok, although he said there is  still a small chance of cancer. but on the paperwork, it said breast neoplasm NOS. can anyone tell me what that means? the only reason I am concerned is because the nurse in outpatient told that meant cancer but the DR didnt mention that at all. I made the comment when she was telling me what to expect ect., that I didnt really want to do it. Her reply was \"well you have no choice since its cancer\". Im like OK, the DR said he didnt think it was. she said that neoplasm was cancer?? so is it or isnt it?? anyways, I am having a lumpectomy tomorrow, but I am just confused.  any help?? thanks beth Log in to post a reply",
