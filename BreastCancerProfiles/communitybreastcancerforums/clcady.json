The surgeon said he had to do the same thing take a bit more tissue than was expected. I don't think a whole cup size though. I am waiting to see what it looks like. (Mine came back invasive cancer which is now gone I'm waiting for the tumor board to come back with what my treatments will be. For myself I didn't even want to look at the option of a mastectomy. Maybe because I am 34. I don't know. What I do know is that the suggestion for a mastectomy was never brought up. I hope that helps a little.",
