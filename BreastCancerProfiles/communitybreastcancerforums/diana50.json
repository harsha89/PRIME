Previous scans, or mammos are often included because often times the radiaologsit will recommend futher testing; ie, MRI, ultrasound, etc.  I believe that in the recent years the insurance companies have become really tough on scans...but of recent breast MRI's are pretty much standard care; especially for women who have dense breasts.  It is becoming standard for your personal doctors to talk to the insurance companies.  Sad, but true.

Progression. Gemzar one week on and one week off. Dropped TM 550 points and just had them done this week. Kidney function normal. Liver feels better. I believe gemzar is working. Scan in January. I think if I have good results either will do maintenance on gemzar or switch to Ibrance with either letrozole or faslodex. Foundation one identified Ibrance as option for me. That's all I got.

On my right side of chest and when I lift stuff or over use right arm slepping groceries etc my port will bother me. The cath runs under my right cavical and I can see it and feel it. Kinda creepy. But when I over use it I kinda massage the cath and it feels better. I am right handed and I think that adds to it. When I was getting two infusions weekly the port was helpful as it also got tender. I think keeping an eye on it is really important. They can always do a blood culture. They draw blood from port and then draw blood from arm and culture it. It is possible to have a silent infection around the port and if doesn't clear up show to your onc. Anyway. Hope you can get into your gardening",

So there is consistency. The nurses are on the front line and where we get chemo the onc offices are right around the corner. So if there are questions on blood work or emergency etc the nurses can talk in person with onc. They have perimeters set for each patient on bloodwork: i.e. Like if patient is below perimeter on magnesium they get mag. Plus the cancer center is on main hospital campus. ER is right around the corner. I live in a small valley. There are only two hospitals treating cancer. There are options for other tx as UC system is close and City of Hope. Plus LA. Our doctors refer out if needed. plus Phoenix has Cancer Center of America. I feel grateful for the treatment I get.

When I was Dx with stage 3 in 2002 I was praying for 5 years before mets would show up. I thought for awhile I was going to be a goner. I waisted 2-3 years worrying about the cancer coming back. My surgeon even recommended keep the port \" in case\". After 3 years of \"clean\" I decided \" if the cancer comes back I'll deal with it b/c I already have once\" and was able to move on. Almost 11 years later mets. (2012)Now I'm 14 year cancer patient with mets liver, kidneys, bone. Doing actually pretty good. My goal is to hit 65. (Medicare) I'm turning 64 in June. Once I get to 65 I'll set another goal. I still have lots of options for treatment and remain upbeat. (Most of the time 😉). No one knows how you will do. Keep plugging along. My thing is I try to avoid complications (infection, bad nutrition etc). I don't want stuff like kidney stents placed unless really necessary. I said no back in 2014 and wanted to give taxol a chance to work and it did. No stents yet. The book Being Mortal really changed how I think about this cancer business. Not today cancer. Nope. 😎 Diana.",

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2013 02:55PM - edited Dec 7, 2013 02:56PM by diana50 i was diagnosed in feb 2002. small tumor but 10 fully encased lymph nodes. Tx was lumpectomy, nodes, TAC (which was a clinical trial back then) and rads. 6 years on arimidex. the first few years were rough', i was scared...anxious..and every little ache..i thought \"cancer\" took me a few years to get comfortable in my body after the aggressive treatment and also for me to wrap my emotions and head around having a \"cancer diagnois\" i didn't have scans but i did see my onc every 6 months for blood work and tumor markers. in august of 2012, ,my tumor marker doubled. i had always been below normal. onc did the test again and it was even higher. i had no pain anywhere except in my right hip. all other blood work great. onc scanned my hip' all i had was a tear in a muscle from too much cycling. she then ordered a PET/SCAN//./and there it was on my T4 vertebra. i had become metatastic. well, i petrifried scared....had to have biopsy...after biopsy found out my cancer was exactly same pathology was it was in 2002. i was never cured but just in remission for 10 and half years. i couldn't believe it. tx as been 25 rads to T4 vertebre, monthly zometa and letrozole. so, i had trouble wrapping my head around the stage4 dx. it took me about 6 months to really work through my feelings about the whole thing. but, i have. i feel so grateful for each day; narely think about stage 4 until i go to the cancer center monthly for my zometa or when i am having side effects. i don't think that i will necessarily die from cancer.i think about Boston...and realize that anything can happen at any time. i am not a pollyanna about my cancer; i am actually very realistic. but i was 49 years old when i was initially diagnosed and now i am 61. that is a lot of living; a lot of loving..and i am grateful. I eat good; but i don't do green drinks. i exercise every day'; walking right now. off the bike because i had surgery on my foot. i journal. i pray every day. i have been able to see my 5 year old nephew grow into a a 16 year old young man. time has been good to me. i only hang with people who love me and i love back. i avoid toxic people. oh, i drink white wine. i don't think of myself as a survivor...more of a warrior...but really, just a woman who got breast cancer, did the treatment...and continues to live life and make the adjustments that i have to make..around the cancer stuff but just also as i age/. aging is a good thing. that is all i got./ it is a rollar coaster ride some days....but take heart that there are all kinds of new trials and treatments. there are some patients who do really well. you can be one of those patients. i have a friend who is stage 3 who is 14 years out and doing great. i don't post much on the boards now, as i see many of my breast cancer peeps on facebook. but i wish each and every one of you all the best this Christmas and Holiday season. and always into 2014. that is all i got. diana 50",

I was having kidney issues with cancer wrapped around kidneys. Started weekly taxol and the taxol cleared out the cancer and I avoided stents. Was stable on taxol but once again TM popped to 1385 in September. Scans showed progression in liver. Started gemzar October and after one cycle TM dropped 400. Too early for scans. TM can be accurate for people and then again not. Scans are gold standard but in my case TMs have been reliable. Rads and new treatment can bring your moms TM down if they are accurate for her. Ask about scan results. Best to you and your mom.",

Back in 2002 when I was on chemo they didn't do that. I think the extra in fluids really helps right after chemo. Also we get iv magnesium if we are low on that. I needed the magnesium the more taxol a I did as time went on. Low magnesium will make you feel wiped out. So maybe ask about that level when you go in for blood work. Now I take magnesium supplements (Slow-Mag) daily. The extra fluids really helped as they want us to drink fluids after chemo and sometimes it's hard to get hydrated. The iv fluids helps in that department. Hope you feel better Diana",

TMs are still in 400. I have two more taxols and then CT scan. If things are stable onc is talking about maintence. Possible new tx. I actually think about staying on taxol but 2 weeks on and two weeks off if it can keep me stable. I know what to expect with taxol side effects. Don't want to have new side effects that I am not used to. All I want is to be stable and have a life. All we all want. If tx can maintain I want to stay on it before switching. Sigh. It's hard to know what to do. Conversation with onc is so important. Best",

Then the chemo started; taxol, Lxempra and now in gemzar. ( gemzar is kicking my butt but also cancer ). I can't help but also wonder about aggressive vs starting with hormone; etc. what bothers me the most as as we go through varying chemos our bodies over time become weak. Blood counts down. Etc. I iften wonder if my onc would have started with aggressive tx if I would be in a different place then I am now. Any of us. I need to read more about this. I got TAC in 2002 and was in remission for almost 11 years. They kicked cancers booty in 2002. Now the goal is \" to keep me stable\" with mets in bones , liver and kidneys. 😱😳. 3 and almost 6 months with mets. Easy treatment to weekly chemo. Doesn't always make sense. ",

Interesting now tho; after 7 years...when I tell people I am a 7 year BC survivor...they are actually more sensitive and supportive then ever.  Maybe in 7 years  from when I was diagnosed (2002) to 2009 so much more education about BC is out there; OR more people know more people diagnosed with it. Havng breast cancer..whether very early stage or late stage...is a very rough ride....from the moment you hear those words \"You have breast cancer\"  to each day you survive.  My experience tho....through my first couple of years...middle to 7 years has changed in how i feel and think about all of this.  I think now; trying to educate people about the disease (if they want to know) is where i am now.  and all i can educate them really ..is my own experiene and what i have learned about bc.  These boards are great. I refer women (any men if they are interested) to read these boards and educate themselves .  sometimes people say stupids things.  i shrug my shoulders and can only know what i believe and what my truth is.  that has seemed to work .  gentle hugs and prayers diana50",

No kids. I do have cats Our social worker at my cAncer center a few months ago said to me \" don't lose your purpose \". At the time I was like \" what do you mean \". Well I get it now. There are so many losses with cAncer. You all know. But after thinking about this I decided a couple of things. I (we) are so limited with this cancer . There are so many losses which can pluck us out of life. I coached and was a family therapist for 35 years. Now at 62 with this disease I have found a new purpose. I give time to newbies diagnosed with cancer. My 12 years can help them. I support them. I am nice to people. Give time to people struggling with major issues. Maybe just being nice to another person is purpose. Maybe an elderly person who needs help at the grocery store. Supporting people at the cAncer center who R newly dx. Asking the chemo nurses how they Are. I smile at people I don't know. There are any people struggling. I believe in good things and I try to pass that along. I walk my neighbors dog because owner is crippled Being kind to others is purpose. It isn't always about \" doing\" as much as it is about being. Our purpose changes even if we don't have cAncer. As long as your heart beats; there is purpose. Our losses R profound. Being human being is priceless. You will be amazed how valuable you are to so many. I see it at the infusion center every day. A kind word and a smile is \" purpose\". I will always believe this. Keep on.    ",

I started weekly taxol and it cleared it up but basically my belly was full of cancer. Into the liver too. They wanted kidney stents I said NO and luckily the chemo worked. Had fluid build up too. The good news is chemo (3 chemos ) has worked and currently stable. On weekly gemzar now. Fluids. Lots of hydration. I have water or gator aid going all the time. Soup. Prune juice every night for constipation. Fluid in belly can be drained. I drink protein drinks every day. Have her onc check her iron. I now take iron supplement and it has helped with red blood cells. Also magnesium. If she is low on magnesium she will be weak. They can give her IV mag but you can also use Slow Mag which doesn't cause any abdominal problems. The weakness rolls into being unable to function. Or eat. Banana shakes. Hopefully she can build herself up so she can get chemo b/c that is what might clear out some of the cancer. It's hard when you are weak and having SE and can't eat. Anything she can drink with nutrition go for it. Hope things get better. Diana",

My dentist also says nothing below jaw line. No problems so far. They need to watch your kidney function as Zometa can cause increase in creatine/bun.

Apparently they don't always do Fish on initial biopsy sample. I hope Fish shows + in Her2. Still ER + which didn't help me much on dx of mets in 2012. My onc is also sending biopsy to Foundation One for genotyping and options for targeted therapy. Don't really know if it makes any difference so we will see. She said no chemo may 26 as I fly out to nephews graduation June 1. Too risky and I want to feel good for nephs special time.

The chemo drains mag out if my body and when below 1.6 I get IV infusion at center. Magnesium regulated muscles. Heart etc. potassium in bananas. I've added matcha green tea to my protein drinks and also take turmeric/pepper tablet daily. I think both have helped with inflammation and over all feeling better. Asked onc and she said ok. Multiple vitamin, calcium, vit D. @ day B complex. I eat a lot of fruit. I guess this is kinda complimentary ??",

Had a brain MRI in July to see if changes from May to july. No change and they think b9 mennigoma. Last week spinal tsp and headache continues. 😖😖😖 should find out tomorrow if I can put head lesion to bed. And lock the door. 👀👀 Ask your onc about Lxempra for chemo. I believe used when taxenes fail. There are three of us on it and there is a thread. This is my 2 nd chemo as taxol worked for 10 months then liver lesion 2.5 cm. and TMs elevated. I am currently getting # 4 lxempratoday. My onc preferred to use this rather then then Gemzar or navebine and keep those and other chemos for later. My Tx has been Femara , taxol 1 every week for 3 and one week off. And know Lxempra. It seems not a lot of peeps on here have gotten Lxempra. Will have scan in a few months. All blood work is good right now. Google and look at studies. It doesn't affect kidney function badly but can raise liver function tests and alkaline phosphate. I feel good about this chemo. 1x@3 weeks. The third week I feel pretty good. The weekly taxol kickef my butt. Time to get unhooked. 👍👍 Oh you get neulasta shot dsy after infusion of Lxempra. Protocol. Best to all Diana",

I know very scary to have cancer in liver but often times tx shrinks the lesions and people do well. This thread has good info for us. Woody is right. If stuff is working you stay with it. Until it stops working or SE's are a reason to change Tx. Not sure how I am doing on gemzar but TM's dropped 400 points after 3 gemzar's. No scan until December or January.

I live very close to San Bernardino terrorist attacks. Horrible. These people got up; brushed their teeth and had breakfast. Went to work. Shot dead. So, I was thinking \" why do I believe I will die from MBC?\" Around the same time out here in protected desert area ; two 75 year olds were out in their golf cart and were hit by a woman on drugs. Dead. I started to rethink this. My brothers died in accidents. (18 and 30). No cancer. No warning. Nothing. They died. Yes, I'm sick. Sone of us will lose our lives b/c of MBC. I hate this disease and hate saying goodbye to people on the boards. So many of us suffering and going through the pain of this disease. However, changing my thinking process a little at a time has helped me cope. If you are out and about (errands and living in life ) anything can happen. I choose to not focus on \"dying of MBC\" until I am in hospice and that's clearly the way it's going. It has helped me define my life right now and not get caught up in \" I am going to die from MBC\". I don't feel like a deer in the headlights. No one knows what will happen. I believe in God and I figure He has my back. Keep plugging along. And plug somemore. Live life and do your errands. As my onc would say \" no one knows \". Till it is time. Not today cancer. Nope.

Around the same time terrorist attack in San Bernardino there was this horrible accident in our desert. In the middle of the afternoon two 75 year old best friend guys were out in gated condo area with their two dogs. Driving around. Enjoying the desert. Some 30' something tweeker on drugs in a Mercedes SUV was speeding (a mom of two kids) and camearound the corner and hit the golf cArt and both men and their dogs were killed instantly. Just like that. Both of those events got me thinking \"why do I believe I will die from MBC\"; changed my thinking in a good way. We are all out and about. Errands; bank grocery store waking cycling etc. sometimes I need to remind myself the fragility of life Cancer or no cancer. Hence the thread. Not today cancer. Nope. Diana",

It's just been the two of us since then. Our parents are gone. Our family of origin very small. Have had conversations with sister and she gets it and reassures me she will be ok and will stay in life. I have two cats; have made plans for them. I have been a person who is very independent and professionally active. Traveled to Eastern Europe doing humanitarian work in children's homes. Huge athlete. This cancer has tweaked that and I struggle daily with SE and at times feeling very incapacitated. I hate that part. I make adjustments and continue to find joy each day with the things I \"can\" do. Once that is gone I'm done. But every day I wake up and say \" not today cancer\" and get on with what I \"can\" do. Makes me happy. And I enjoy the competition with cancer. I dig in and fight. For all of us. Better days ahead. Hugs",

In July I thought I was toast (not in a good way). Mets in peritoneal and retro peritoneal areas. Serious kidney failure. Started the taxol 5 days after bad scan in July Good news. No significant abnormal areas of uptake. Scan was no evidence of active disease. Liver lesion showed zero activity. Taxol has worked. Woot. Plan. My TM is still in 300's. Onc wants to continue taxol for three more cycles and then scan and see what the markers do. If continued response then maybe move to something other then taxol. I feel blessed. I understand this disease. It can change on a dime. All I know now is I am still alive , my reasons to stay alive are close to me and all I want to do is be human and feel the joy of life.

Your onc will come up with a new Tx plan to hit those nasty cancer cells. I just started gemzar three weeks on and one week off . Praying it will lower TM and cancer burden.

Good news is after only two gemzar my kidney function (creatine) is normal which hasn't been for 4 months. Thinking gemzar is doing its business in liver and belly. No scan for at least 3 months. Haven't seen TMs yet but feeling like they are coming down. Liver met biggest is 4cm X 4.9 cm. plus lots of little ones. Following thread closely. Praying for all of us. Liver enzymes and AP still in normal range too. Everyone take good care and keep on. Yep ⚡️⚡️💐💐👊🏻",

I guess that is why those scans are so important. Reduced dose of gemzar (appears to be working) as TM now 803. Was 1358 in early October. SE are very bad. Incapacitating really. Fever 102 Thanksgiving and fever for 5 days. I get two fever free days a week. Body rash. All from inflammation. Body trashed. Walking when I can. On a bad day I can't go. Boo. Still believe gemzar working so one more cycle of 3 weeks on 1 week off. December will be another tough month physically. Can't scan until January. We go from there. Reduce dose has helped somewhat. But SE rule right now. Not in a good way. All I can say is hang in. Even when you don't want to (Had a few \" mommy, I don't want to do this anymore.)Lol. I keep track of you all. Good news celebrate. Hard news remember there are options. Best to all Diana",

Even though my liver responded to gemzar I did have progression in bones. After talking to RO we are just going yo keep an eye on it ( small spots) rather then go toxic rads. Staying on gemzar for liver and kidneys may help. I try to avoid too much toxic TX except for liver ad belly mets. waiting for scans is the worst. The cancer pathology can change anytime it wants to. Maybe more difficult to TX but maybe less difficult as we go through this stuff. You never know and that's the hard part for me. I find myself constantly assessing my body; pain and performance. Anyway. Losses of friends and people we know give us reality of what we are dealing with on a daily basis. Hang in there. Remember scans and blood work gather information for Tx. Hang in Diana ",

I am always interested in the SUV rate on Pet portion. The higher the value the more aggressive. ( from what I have read). My initial spinal tumor was 4. 6 SUV and the highest on July 3 scan was 2.8 in my belly. Go figure. The recent Pet/ct scan results changed my tx from letrozole to taxol. I had had clear scans for a year and half but with rising TM s. Finally cancer showed up on July 3 scan. And one of the spots on liver 1.8 cm only showed on the CT portion of the Pet/ CT scan.

I had my T4 radiated when first dx with mets. 24 rads and it totally took out the cAncer. It was eating its way to my spinal cord. The area is clean now and no complications from the rads to spine.

It takes some time to wrap your emotions and head around it. The Pet scan is a good thing as the information will give you and oncologist opportunity for treatment plan. The Pet will let your onc if rads, chemo or oral or other stuff will help. Just remember. Lots of stuff available. Once you meet people here you will know what a strong group we are. Even on the hard days. A biopsy of the cAncer is important if they can get to it. Gives pathology and if things have changed in the last years. Also helps with treatment options. Always be thinking treatment options because there are many for us. I was initially dx in 2002 with mets in 2012. Doing well at the moment. Focus in on your life and how valuable you are to your people. Allow time to let the dx settle in but be proactive in your care. You are not alone even though you may feel like that right now this is a loving, supportive And knowledgeable community 👍👍 Keep on",

      "Content": "Jul 9, 2015 12:04PM - edited Jul 9, 2015 12:05PM by diana50 I think \"feeling sick\" is all relative to how many years we have been in Tx and often times side effects from Tx. Plus age and number of years we have been in Tx. I was feeling very sick a year ago when my kidneys were failing from waste build up in my body. Actually felt better when taxol worked and kidneys started working again. It all depends on where cAncer sets up shop in our body. Liver, kidneys, lungs, brain and bones. When Dx with spinal met in 2012 I was shocked as I was cycling and feeling great. But from the point it moved into kidneys I felt very sick. Now I feel pretty good except Lxempra side effects and neutopathy from taxol. Plus I am 63. 👀👀👀. When tumor burden is lessened in body with tx I think potential for feeling better is increased. Best to all. Hang Ineven on hArd days. Diana",
