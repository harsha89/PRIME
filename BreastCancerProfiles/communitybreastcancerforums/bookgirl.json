My Breast Surgeon did a ultra sound and felt it to be a cyst. My one year Mammogram showed nothing but the mass still was there and easy to feel. My BS ordered a MRI.. also clear, but she was uncomfortable since the mass felt like the \"bad\" one. So I had a biopsy in Nov. It turned out to a Benign tumor. (Hooray!) I had clear margins, chemo, tamox, radiation and the same type tumor removed at the same time as the cancer in almost the same spot. So my thoughts are with you and praying for a big B9 for you!",

I was high normal but now just above normal. My onc said it could be lab error, or it could be from a hematoma (sp?) in the bad breast. Or it could continue to rise.

I guess I'm a little calmer that I expected I would be but was really hoping for a downward trend.",
