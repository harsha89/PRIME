I started with low red blood counts (from surgery & fertility procedures) and they told me that I probably would have to have a transfusion. I ate to keep my red blood counts up and tweaked my diet along the way. I didn't have to have a transfusion (even if it happens it's no big deal they do it regularly) and my numbers stayed pretty steady throughout the chemo. I exercised before all this and did exercise or at least walk for 30 min almost everyday, 5/7 days a week. I think the walking, eating to keep my numbers up , and the anti-nausea drugs really made it a lot smoother than I expected. But everyone is different, the woman next to me on my first day of chemo was going through the same treatment plan and she was having a hard time with it where I was lucky and didn't experience many SE. Drink plenty of water with electrolytes. I posted and followed the starting chemo in September Board. I foudn it really helpful to post when I was going through it.",

Justmaximom I can't wait to have my port removed. It'll be awhile for me but I bet it feels great not to have that foreign object in your chest. 6 more for me, no boosts, skin holding up well. I have discoloration where my nipple used to be but my RO says that is normal and will go back after treatment. I had some armpit chafing or irritation but I stuck to loose fitting clothes and that subsided. I find this step emotional because it's the last step in this process and afterwards we wait. I can see how the radiation treatment room could be isolated and cold compared to the chemo set up but I find this step as warm and friendly as chemo. The girl at check in knows my name and I meet and compare experiences with other women in the back changing room/ waiting room unlike In chemo when others were depressed or sick or just wanted to sleep. The RN's pay music I like and always worry about their cold hands on me, lol. They pimp the warm blankets daily and ask if we would like anything to drink as well as offer free lotion. I saw today my office has a Dr. Hung lol ",
