      "Content": "2verna2 wrote: I found so much help on this site when my mom was dying of breast cancer. All my family is deceased, and my local friendships drifted while I was so preoccupied with mom's care. Once she died, my best friend's cancer began to get the better of her, and she has now passed on. I had the great privilige of knowing these two women for so many rich years, through the intimacies of their journey, and their final passing. I'm tired now. I feel a little alone, but also well-companioned by myself and what I shared with mom and my friend. It's only been a few months, and I'm working on finishing school. I've just started in hiking and dancing again, and looking forward to the restorative powers of time and nature. Ah, but it looks like I am in for another round of something before there will be some rest. I have some abnormal changes in one of my breasts (fixed mass plus retraction) that is very concerning to me. I have made an appointment with a stellar internist - I know I will be in good hands ... and now, I am trying not to plan my own double mastectomy and divide my finances by 'time left'. Oh, how quickly the mind goes there. I have enough healthcare background to know the changes in my breast are probably not benign. But .... god it's good to read through the posts on this site and know that you're all here, that many struggle with these kinds of questions, and that there is still humor, life and optimism along with everything else. I am pretty sure the doc will want to ultrasound then biopsy this thing. Even though the literature says that biopsies don't track cancer cells back into the tissue ... I don't entirely trust that. Since breast cancer is so slow growing, it may take 5-10 years before that cancer would appear. And naturally, there isn't a control group for that study (would be unethical to intentionally not biopsy). My line of thinking has always been a little counter to traditional medicine. Okay, but this time, it is leading me to want a mastectomy as a first line intervention. I actually think this is logical. Then I get weepy about losing my breast, wonder if symmetry matters (remove both?), and how that will affect future dating etc. I know I am 'ahead of myself' in some ways. But I think I am being realistic and trying to prepare myself for discussions with my MD. My breast does not look right. Can anyone help me with their experience making decisions like this or how it is now? verna Log in to post a reply",
