I was diagnosed on March 28 but it\u2019s taken awhile to coordinate the surgeon and the RO. I just want this tumor out and (hopefully) a good pathology report. I\u2019m 50 and single so my mom is flying in to take care of me (you're never too old to want your mommyðŸ˜Š). Iwish you and Prairiedog all the best for your surgery and recovery.",

Apparently they send the node to pathology during surgery and get a result right away. After surgery they send everything for final pathology which takes several days. When I first met with my SO she gave me a paper with a list of the ROs and MOs she works with and I had to pick them and call them myself. Angela",

Surgery was scheduled for 1 PM but the day started at 8:45 AM with the SNB injection. They injected a dye with some radioactive material into the tumor area (stung a little) 45 min later they used a wand like a geiger counter that beeped to indicate what nodes the material drained to. Next they used ultrasound to insert wires through the node and through the breast tumor to guide the surgeon. They taped the ends of the wire down to my skin. Next I had a mammogram to make sure everything was in place. Finally they took me into surgery. After surgery I'm told the surgeon talked to me but i don't remember that at all. She said the lymph node was benign but I have to wait to get the full pathology. Apparently the IORT went well and if the pathology is good I won't have to do any more radiation. I'm going to do a write up on IORT on the boards because I researched it to death and there's not a lot on here about it. I am so glad to have this surgery done and I truly appreciate all of your support, prayers and well wishes. Angela",

My breast didn't really like being jostled around in the car and walking around the office. I realize now that I had very little pain the week following surgery because my breast was/is numb. Now that the numbness is wearing off, my breast is much more sensitive and there is some more pain. I finally got my pathology results after 5 days. I had sincerely hoped that the IORT would be all the radiation I needed because I really, really don't want to do whole breast radiation for 5 weeks. Unfortunately, while I was diagnosed with IDC, the pathology found DCIS that did not show up on any of the many tests I had previously. Because of that, I now have to do radiation. They will consider the IORT I had during surgery as the \"boost\" dose of radiation that they usually do at the end of the radiation cycle. I'm afraid I've read too much on the radiation boards and I'm scared to death about the skin side effects, the fatigue, and being able to work during the 5 weeks (5-days a week) of treatment. The good news is the lymph node was benign and the margins were clear of IDC. I'm now waiting for the Oncotype DX test to come back to see if I need any chemo before radiation. ReadyAbout, I hope all went well today! To the 5/17 ladies (Saved_by_grace, Well_then, and uneedaklu) I'm wishing you all well tomorrow. (((Hugs)))",
