I'm hoping you ladies that have had a similar experience as my mom can answer some questions re: post mastectomy recovery and drains. She had a bilateral with expanders placed in- she has 6 drains. Today is Sunday, she had surgery this past Thursday, and was in the hospital 2 nights. They are bulky bulbs pinned to her post surgery bra. We (me!-yikes!) is emptying them every 8 hours or so. One side is definitley outputting less- under 15 cc's, one side a little more at approx. 30 cc's. I'm been searching on the internet if this is good progress or not. I'm going in circles! The fluid is less bloody looking. Also- I swallowed down some minor panic when after I helped her empty and re-pin a drain, fluid started rapidly draining into it. Not A LOT by any means, about 20 cc's. I down played it and mumbled something about suction and moving it around while we were emptying it. I then saw that the lower part of the tubes have fluid accumualted in them, but exactly how does it make it to the drains?? Can they get backed up? Getting worried, but not saying anything to mom. She feels well enough, pain is managed by pills, no fever. I made sure they were repinned in good spots and weren't crimped. Oy! I know these are probably basic questions, but hoping someone who has been through this can enlighten me before her appt. with her surgeon Tues. Thank you so very much!! Log in to post a reply",

The nurses just don't tell you EVERYTHING!  I think I'm so nervous myself about helping her correctly, I'm afraid on how to properly deal with those drains. I hope her surgeon decides to take out at least a few at her appt. Is that an uncomfortable experience? I hope she has the worse behind her. Her nodes were clear and her \"margins\" were good (think that's the right term?) So, that's a blessing.  Thanks again:-)",
