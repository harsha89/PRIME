This is truly worth looking into for those of you that are not a candidate for liver surgery. TACE procedure is when they place chemo beads directly into the liver which kills off the blood supply to the liver tumors creating ghost lesions. Her oncologist suggested this chemo treatment since her previous systemic chemo was giving her many side effects and she needed a chemo break. So, please google \"chemo beads\" and ask your oncologist about this treatment for liver mets. HOPE LIVES!",
