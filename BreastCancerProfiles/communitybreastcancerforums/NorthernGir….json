My first reaction was to want a bilateral mastectomy as my thoughts were why keep something that would try and kill me. I am part of the watch and wait club with having mammogram then MRI alternating every 6 months. At first this also was not acceptable to me. I have my first 6 month mammogram next month and I am very nervous. But in saying this I am glad that I gave my mind/emotions/thoughts some time to let my diagnosis set in and allow me to \u201cthink\u201d things through. With my diagnosis I have time to decide what is best for me, which may be very different from someone else. There are risks behind having surgery which are life changing as well risks that I could develop a more serious cancer. I have decided to wait for my first MRI results then decide what is best for me. For me I feel it is best to take the time to research and talk to professionals about my diagnosis and not let my emotions of being literally scared out of my mind make my descions for me. My grandmothers both died of horrible cancer, I have higher risks. But not everyone with ALH, LCIS develop cancer. In saying this I still have a bad feeling about myself which makes me still want to go ahead with the mastectomy. But I do feel so much better in my decision to at least wait for my first MRI results. I guess what I am trying to say is to take some time and let this all sink in before deciding what\u2019s best for you, don\u2019t let fear drive your decisions",

They are doing the infusions separately for this cycle to check for adverse reactions. If all goes well, the next infusions will be done together. I met with my onc today (it's an 8 hour round trip and my appointment was less than 1/2 hour long...what a long day) .The doc explained that the taxol has quite different side effects than FEC, and there's a strong chance of allergic response. It still causes the low white blood cell count that patients experience on FEC or AC. Good luck to you girls who are experiencing infections and rashes and other side effects.

For neupogen you get  injections daily for several days, depending on how low your blood count is and how well you respond. If you are get weekly chemo you would get Neupogen not Neulasta. A possible side effect for both is bone pain. Neulasta is really expensive, like $3000 per shot, neupogen is about $300. We had to check whether our drug plan would cover the Neulasta (thankfully, it did) Hang in there Mimi. This Docetaxel stuff is wicked, but we can do this.

I hope I get a few months where I feel well, and can catch up on some household projects. I thought it would be tougher to adjust from two incomes to one, but it has been okay. I am sure I couldn't do that if I was single. Is anyone else due for mastectomy when their chemo is done? How long was recovery?",

Thank you for being available... night or day for cyber hugs and hand holding. Trusting: If I had to compare my experience with FEC vs Docetaxel... side effects with FEC got more pronounced with each infusion. I had scary breathlessness and chest pain, lots of pressure in my head, and overall sick feeling. Nausea but no throwing up. I get chemo on the Friday, I was weak but okay on Sat and Sun, then I would feel sick. After the 3rd (and last) infusion, I was really sick for 3 days, then slowly got on the mend. The breathlessness is inconvenient but not painful and it lasted for about 10 days or so.  I had my first Docetaxel last Friday. Again I was weak on Sat and Sun, but okay otherwise. Starting Mon till today: terrible bone pain and muscle pain. Spasms throughout my legs, pelvis, back, shoulders, and arms. It was bad. The onc prescribed Tylenol 3. When pain was at its worst, the meds work for about 3 hours, and I was never completely pain free. This went on, night and day. It was difficult to get decent sleep. Things are better today. Tylenol3 is working just fine. In addition I got thrush which is making it hard to swallow, so sometimes taking pain meds is rough and eating... ick. I don't want to be a negative nelly, but it's been rough. So Docetaxel is a different reaction completely. I was hoping for less severe reaction. For my next infusion, they have prescribed a painkiller to start taking the day before and continue for a few days following. God I hope it works. The good thing:  only 2 more infusions of this, then on to Herceptin which apparently has minimal side effects. DesignerMom:  I love your spirit -  and your fabulous memory and ability to remember what each of us is up to. You are like a den mother checking in on all her charges.

The bone pain is not as bad as it was, the mouth sores are getting better, the weakness and neuropathy are severe and the twitchy watery eyes are constant. I have been reading about the girls who have been getting out with friends and attending events. I am envious. I can't wait for this to be done. I've been too sick to celebrate the end of chemo, but I am looking forward to it. I have difficulty standing or walking for more than a couple of minutes. The pelvis pain is intense. Anyone else get this?  Met with a PS last week in Toronto. He does TRAM flap reconstruction. The hospital he works out of (Women's College Hospital) has recently switched to a process called ambulatory care. The PS says there is no overnight stay for mastectomy and TRAM flap reconstruction. Out you go, but since I don't live in the area, I would be expected to stay at a nearby hotel for 5-7 days until the drains come out and everything is stable. Is it just me, or does this sound barbaric?  Hubby certainly doesn't have any medical background to tend to me, though the PS says they can arrange for in-home nursing... in a hotel!!! The idea of shuffling across a hotel lobby in downtown Toronto just doesn't sit well with me.  I am going to meet with a DIEP flap specialist next - and hopefully at a hospital that still believes in a hospital stay for surgery. It sounds like major stuff. This weekend is Canadian Thanksgiving. The whole family will be home!!!  My at-home kids are making the dinner - a 9 kg turkey. Should be interesting.

I had a phone-in appointment with an oncology social worker today (can't attend the appointment in person because of the distance)  It was really helpful. She gave me all kinds of resources to research, and it was good to talk things out with her. The social worker also gave me the heads up about financial support from CPP ( applies to Canadians) which kicks in when EI sick leave runs out. Wow, how nice is that. CPP also has a children's benefit program for kids 18-25 years who are full-time students. Wow. I had no idea.  D'Mom:  I'm also getting the watery eyes. GRRRR. The onc referred me to an opthamologist. Apparently there is a chance of cataracts and other eye damage thanks to the chemo. Hope you feel better soon.",

I never would have guessed that I would be sitting here bald, in groovy bone pain, out of work and dealing with the big C. But atleast my hubby is still my best buddy and I have really wonderful, beautiful kids. There are so many things that I wish were different, but I can still count my blessings. Since we knew I would be going through all this side effect stuff again, we decided to postpone an anniversary dinner for about a month. Maybe we can get away somewhere with a decent restaurant. We really hope to plan something fun with our friends and families next year.  Our second daughter turns 20 on the 22nd. She's away at university but hopes to be able to get home this weekend even though it's a full day's drive away. We miss her and she finds it tough to be away from home when all this is going on.  My hubby and our youngest son have planned a nice bbq menu for the weekend and they want to invite the whole family. This should be interesting. I hope I am better by then. They hired a temp to fill my position at work. I never thought this cancer thing would go so long, so it makes sense, but feels sad. My hubby picked up a couple of boxes of my personal stuff that was in my office. I loved my office. They are holding my job for me for one year, which is really great. Some days I can't imagine going back to the hectic pace and events that I was doing. I miss the people, and the income, but not the hours and the stress.   SKD: we seem to be on the same schedule. I just finished Docetaxel and in 3 weeks I will start tamoxifen too. Not sure what to expect with that. JenMarie9:  The trip may be a great break from cancer. But be careful with bottled water and cooked foods only. Maybe wear a mask during the flights... you don't want to risk infection, Have a great time. TMarina:  I am always learning things from the girls on this blog. I just assumed when chemo is done, the neuropthy would disappear?  It makes sense that we would have to worry about exposure to cold. How long can this neuropathy last. I have it in my hands, but really bad in my feet. And weirdly, on my face. It feels like the freezing you might get at the dentist. It's good to know this, with winter around the corner...",

It delayed the bone pain, but it was back. It was awful.

The onc says that only about 20% of women on docetaxel will get bone pain, and only a small fraction of them need pain meds to deal with it. I am just one of those special people I guess. Still, today it is more bearable so I can only hope that it doesn't last as long as the last infusion, where the bone pain lasted 8 days. So the onc says he may have to adjust the dosage as clearly I can not tolerate this dosage. BON:  My heart goes out to you and to all that you have to deal with. Be strong for you and mum. You gave me such a great chuckle, during a dark time, with your comment about \"Richard, the rat...\" Thank you for the laugh. Congratulations that you are no longer celebrating that anniversary.

Maybe your red blotches are the beginning of acne??? Trusting: thanks for the message. It's great when the kids go off to school, but especially when university is miles away from home, it can be tough on our daughters to be heading off when so much is going on at home.

Side effects are really minimal: fatigue, heartburn and weakness. The only unexpected thing was chest pain and shortness of breath. I was checked out at the hospital, there's no bloodclot, and apparently no explanation. I wonder if others are having similar reaction? Also, I was reading other posters about the delay in starting chemo. My onc did not seem to think it was a problem... I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy on Feb 5/2010, followed by more tests, another excision on Apr 30. Margins still aren't clear so more surgery is needed, but the doc said I should start chemo rather than delay and have more surgery. I started chemo on June 4. I will be getting FEC100, Docetaxel, then Herceptin.  Best wishes girls ",

I am on FEC100. Don't know how long to expect the pain to continue in my arm. Is the damage to the veins permanent? I too have been surprised at how insensitive some people can be. I had an appointment with my family doctor. While in the waiting room, the receptionist came to sit next to me... I've known her for about 10 years. She lowers her voice and says. Don't worry, everything is going to be just fine. I said, I hope so. She again insists this cancer thing is going to be just fine, you'll see, it will be over before you know it, no one even gets mastectomies anymore, and everything will be back to normal before I know it. I was fed up with this approach as it seems to minimize what I am going through. I looked at her with wide eyes and said, Oh really? How do you know? That's not the information the oncologist told me. Do you think he made a mistake? How can you tell which patients will recover well and which will not do well?  She sputtered a bit and went back to work.  When I got in to see the doc, I told him that we both know people whose outcomes with breast cancer were not good.I think it's irresponsible when his receptionist tries to be compassionate by making assurances that are inaccurate. I hope and pray for the best, but this cancer thing is a lot of work, without any guarantees. Maybe I was mean with the receptionist, but I am facing a mastectomy, a long and difficult battle, and alot of unkowns. False assurances doesn't change that.   Well, that's my vent!",

They started out with a very slow drip and as I had no reaction, they slowly ramped it up. They gave me gel mitts. No benadryl. I took decadron the day before, the day of and the day after infusion... the dose was doubled from when I was on FEC. So far, so good, the only strong reaction was the flushed feeling due to the decadron (a steroid). Thank goodness, I can still sleep through all this. My heart goes out to you ladies who are up at all hours. You poor dears! Not sure if it's due to the gel mitts but my nails feel fine. I have a weird slick feeling in my mouth and things taste off. There's some fatigue and weakness, but generally things are just groovy compared to the side effects following FEC. Julia2: I worry when you say you are taking Advil... don't know if other docs are saying this, but my onc and my onc nurses keep warning me to take Tylenol, because Advil will thin the blood, something we girls don't need right now... It's weird when people tell me I look so beautiful... who are you kidding ?!? I am doing okay, but give me a break. My hair is gone, my eyebrows and eyelashes almost don't exist, my face is puffy and flushed, and I am breathless and weak... and that's just what you can see (never mind the weird bowels, the funky mouth and the bruises or scrapes that don't heal well) I am okay with people noticing and appreciating that, instead of pretending I look fine.... But my hubby and I were saying, that before we walked this path, would we really have known what to say to people who were undergoing serious illness? Hopefully we didn't say anything too stupid, but I wouldn't put it past us. I feel SO much older and wiser now... KittyKat: take the time off! You need it. If there was ever a time in your life that you deserve it, it is now. Even taking just a week at a time, just doesn't seem enough. If you need some added stimulus, there are always little home or yard projects that you can set up for yourself at a pace that works for you. For me, it was just so disruptive to keep taking time off for tests, appointments and surgeries, so I took a long term leave. They will keep my job available for me for 18 months (without pay). I have been off for 6 months, since Feb and it has been a godsend. When I feel well, I get to some home tasks, and  I spend much more time with family and friends.  When I feel sick, there's no one to call in to. The peace of mind was worth it. If it weren't that I have been so sick, I have never enjoyed a summer more.I try to walk or do calisthenics every morning.  I have a lovely shaded back deck where I set up on a nice afternoon, sometimes to nap, sometimes to read, sometimes to crochet, or sometimes to just sit and try to breathe well as I watch the hummingbirds visit my flower pots. I hope this time will be a positive part of my recovery. Who knows... but I don't miss the work stress, the meetings, the deadlines and the overtime. No money is no fun with 3 kids still at home, but hubby is working and so far, things are okay. Good luck.",

There's so much going on with our bodies, and so much that is unpredictable. Like Chey, I feel such trepidation about the next infusion. After a week of yuck, I am feeling better, and stronger. It's hard to think of going to the next chemo and getting sick all over again. Gotta find my big girl panties and get over it. To the girls who don't have supportive partners in their lives:  I hope you have great friends and family by your side. You are the priority. You don't need to spend precious time and energy on fellows who just can't step up.  I like Janny's Marilyn Monroe quote; \"If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my besst\"  Love this! When I got diagnosed, the timing was unbelievable. We've been through a tough year with my youngest son who had a complicated tumour growing through the tibia of his left leg. It wasn't cancerous, but his doctors used really cutting edge stuff to save his leg from amputation. After lots procedures and two surgeries, things are looking really good for him now. A few months before my son's last surgery, we find out I have breast cancer. My second excision surgery was 10 days after his second surgery. I was being treated at a cancer facility 4 hours from our home, and my son at a children's hospital 8 hours from our home. My daughters were at universities in 2 different cities across the province. I kept apologising to my family that they have to go through this. They've been through enough. My husband and kids have been so wonderful. This cancer thing is actually drawing us closer together. This is the first time that my husband has really been my caretaker. It's a whole new dimension of caring for each other. He's great at it. And it's been great for both of us to slow down and spend lots of quiet time with family. At one point my hubby said, if this was happening to him, wouldn't I step up and take good care of him... which is true, I totally would.  And he reminds me we're in this, \"for better or for worse\"  He says I have given him plenty of the \"for better\" part, and he has given me too much of his \"for worse\" part. I really wish every person facing the cancer beast had a good quiet loving soul to lean on, no matter what... it's like potent medicine in facing this cancer monster.",

I get a bad reaction to percoset, but I will ask the onc tomorrow for other pain relief options in time for the infusion on Thursday. I was prescribed gabapentin which I am supposed to start the day before infusion. God I hope it works. I used gel mitts for my hands and feet to minimize neuropathy. Not sure if it worked, I still got a burning sensation to my fingertips for a few days about a week after infusion. My fingertips started to peel also. My feet are fine though. I am going to look up compazine and prevacid. I am not familiar with those, but I do take decadron with my infusions. I got benadryl with the FEC infusion, but I am not getting an allergic reaction to Docetaxel so it wasn't needed. Best wishes",

I met with my onc (I live about a 4 hour drive away, so we meet by teleconference sometimes) He prescribed gabapentin for pain. God I hope it works. I am a crying mess about having to go for my 2nd infusion of Docetaxel tomorrow. The onc also changed the steroid script. I now take it for more days. Again, I hope it helps manage the incredible bone pain. Toni:  I had burning and tingling fingers after my first infusion too. My finger tips started to peel, kinda like eczema. It lasted about 4 or 5 days.  Things are fine now, though my nails are all ridged with funky two-tone stripes. SKD Thanks... I used the gel mitts for my first infusion. I will be using them again tomorrow. I want to get some tea tree oil to see if it will make a difference. I went for my pre-infusion blood work today. Thank goodness for wonderful onc nurses. They got the news about my painful side effects following my first Doc infusion and they were just so kind. I couldn't help but break down and cry with them. They were so empathetic. Somehow it made me feel stronger about doing this again. It's Ativan all the way tomorrow. I hate being such a suck, but it's so hard to line yourself up for such an unpleasant experience as yet another infusion of poison, plus all the nasty feelings of taking all these drugs. I was never a pill-taker, and I am sure part of my difficulties is my resistance to taking meds. Oh well, it's back in the saddle again tomorrow morning ... grrrrrrr Congrats to you girls who are done!  I hope you get to treat yourselves to something wonderful!",

It lasted over a week, but for about 4 days it was very severe and like you, there were days I thought I would rather die than do this. Call your oncology unit where you get your treatments, or your doctor for help. I hope you have family or friends with you to take care of you. My husband would rub down my back and legs and I found that gave me some relief. You don't need to suffer like this. They gave me a script for gabapentin for my second infusion. It's a nerve blocker for pain. Don't know if it works, I just started the prescription yesterday and had my second infusion was today. They also said they have some med for the mouth sores if I get them again. I forget the name of the stuff. i got Nyastin for the fungal infection in my mouth and throat. I found it impossible to swallow. The Nyastin worked after just a couple of doses. I had to stop taking it due to terrible diarrhea but atleast the mouth problems were over. It sounds like we had the same reaction to this poison.  Hang in there Mimi. As terrible as it is, the pain will end. Really. There will be brighter days Mimi. My prayers go out to you Mimi, Chey and for Bon's mum. This is a tough time. keep us posted on her progress.  I had my second Doc treatment today. The nurses are so sweet, knowing how I suffered with my first treatment. I got the gel mits, they did the infusion real slow, gave me info to deal with the heartburn, the mouth sores, diarrhea, and more. Because the Zantac doesn't seem to do the job for the heartburn, I will be taking Nexium. I hope it works better. I got the gabapentin prescription going. I feel tired and a little loopy, but okay. Hopefully the bone pain will not happen this time.",

It's Day 8 for me and the bone pain continues, but it's manageable. Other side effects continue...

The chemo treatments will go on for a year. While I am not looking forward to another surgery, the port sounds like a great idea. I had my 2nd chemo yesterday and they had so much trouble finding a good vein. The port will solve that.   Since I have DD+ breasts. it worked well to have a lumpectomy and then re-excision. I still have positive margins. Emotionally I don't know how many more surgeries I can put up with. Gotta decide:  another excision with chance of more positive margins, or total mastectomy??? I am surprised how many girls on this thread had just Stage 0 or Stage 1 and low grade and had a mastectomies.  I am just Stage 1 with IDC that is high grade, but during the surgeies, they found large DCIS which doesn't show up in ultrasound or MRI... it was identified in the pathology of the tissue sample.  Maybe there are other factors to determine which treatment option to pursue?",

We live in a small town with no oncologists and no plastic surgeons. We are about 8 or 9 hours away from Toronto where we could access lots of services. Our doc will set us up with contacts in Toronto, but I am not sure how easy it will be to find second/third opinions. I am really interested in the immediate reconstruction using your own tissue. I don't know enough about it, but I have some time to learn. Surgery will be in a few months as I am undergoing chemo now.  In_cognito:  wish I was near you to lend some support your way. We LOVE little ones. Plus I have two older daughters who are wonderful with children. It makes such a difference to have support on the home front. My oldest daughter just finished university this week. My hubby and son have gone to Ottawa to pick her up and move her home as she got a job in her field. I have not seen her in 2 months and I am a bit worried how she will take it to see me now bald and weak. My younger daughter has stayed home with me. She has been a fabulous support. My kids have been so supportive and kind. I am so lucky. We have been great with communication and so far, things have been okay. I am one week out from 2nd chemo, and 4 days post surgery for port. The port site is more sore than I expected. Other than lots of heartburn, things are feeling okay. best wishes...",

I too had trouble with the sentinel node biopsy. Whoever dreamed up injections into your nipples must be a really callous creep. That was awful. Then I had three weeks of pain at the incision site. Lotsa fun. LauraM and MRDRN: Your info about reconstruction after mastectomy is so helpful. I had a lumpectomy, followed by re-excision. The margins were still positive. The surgeon seems to think that he can try another excision and then a breast reduction on the other side to make things symetrical. The oncologists seem to think a mastectomy is the better route. I have large breasts so even after two excisions, things aren't even, but it's not too bad. I could not delay the start of chemo (I was diagnosed in Jan. 2010 and started chemo in June 2010)  I will be on chemo for a year, so other than installation of a port on Tuesday, I have my next excision or mastectomy sometime next year.  Thanks girls for any suggestions or advice.",
