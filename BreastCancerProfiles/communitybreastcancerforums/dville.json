Debbie, it sounds like you might know a lot about lymphdema. Is that what it is when your underarm fills up sort of like a sack of gel? It was like this right after surgery and then cleared up, but now is back. I have an appointment with the lymphedema therapists that was very hard to get, so...I hope that's what it is. Are all of you getting xrays often to make sure everything is lined up correctly? My onc wants to xray twice a week and that seems like a lot. Is that too much or standard? I know, I know.

I read something somewhere else that some of you may not seen. Just skip it if you have. A beautiful woman woke up one day and when she looked into the mirror she found that she had only 3 hairs. \"Hmmm, I think I'll braid my hair today,\" she said. And she did. And she had a good day. The next day when th beautiful woman awoke, she loked into the mirror and found that she had only 2 hairs. \"I think I'll part my hair down the middle,\" she said. And she did. And she had a great day. Soon afterwards, the bautifull woman woke up and looked in the mirror to find that she had only 1 hair left upon her head. \"I think I'll wear my hair in a ponytail today,\" she said. And she did. And she had a wonderful day! I am still losing hair and have only a skimpy little fringe. I think if I counted there would be less than 100 hairs, but it looks OK under a huge sun hat which is what I wear for jogging in the pool. Those of you at the end of chemo might want to try biotin--a vitamin at the health food stores. it's supposed to be great for hair and nails. Denise, what is Nioxin and where do you buy it?

He showed me on the report from my last scan where it said from the size and shape of the speck on my liver that it did NOT look cancerous. (See, I am feeling better all the time.) I do have to get a pap smear recheck. I had one the day before I started chemo and it was a little bit funky. The onc said chemo will mess up pap smear results and I should wait until hair starts coming in, probably a couple of months. I am still bald except for about 15 of my old hairs that never came out. Eyebrows, eyelashes and \"down there\" very patchy. Soon it will start growing back. I can't wait! OK, OK, I know I'm going on and on, but I am so excited. I have a question. My onc said I could start tamoxifen while I'm still on radiation if I was interested. He said he doesn't usually do that, but some people do and It's up to me. What do you all think? Does anybody have any experience with this? I may start a thread on the hormone therapy board. I don't know anything about it, but it's very important to me to have a good Christmas.

All my children got to feed apples and pears to cows when they were toddlers. Cows are so peaceful and pretty. I am sorry your special one died. I had my second to last treatment today. One more to go, as long as everything is OK. I met 2 women with reoccurences at the center today and that is so depressing. I try to stay hopeful as possible but sometimes I get scared. My scans before I started chemo showed a speck of something on my lung so I will get it rescanned at 6 months. I told the onc December because I want to get it done, but what if it is bad news? Should I wait until after Christmas to get the scan? A wonderful girl from Japan who was our exchange student is coming to visit and we will also visit with lots of other family and people come from all over the country. A bad report would ruin it, but a clean one would be so great. I was feeling pretty confident that it was nothing because my surgeon said it would not have had time to appear there yet, but the woman I met today with breast cancer in the lung really got to me. Her reoccurence was at 2.5 years. She was on her 20th weekly Taxol today and she was really upset, just frantic, even at 4 months into this 2nd treatment. She says she just stays in her room and tries to read. I spent a lot of time today trying to cheer her up and telling her about this board and the cancer center in Athens and some of the stuff they have there. Now that I'm home I realize she really brought me down. Her tumor IS shrinking with the Taxol and she did not get Taxol the first time out like so many of us are right now and she also did not do RADS, though I'm not sure why because she had 2 positive nodes. All she did was a mascectomy and 4 AC. Anyway, thanks for letting me vent. I sure hope none of us have reoccurence, but people survive those also. I need to deal with what's on my plate right now and not borrow indigestion from next week or next month or next year! They say if you can go 5 years NED that is very good. If you can make it 10 years your stats are the same as a person who has never had BC. Hang in there girls. We're going to make it. Debbie M.",

I'm trying hard not to think about it. Garnetann--is that bell ringing yet? How about you Kathleen? It's a great feeling to know you don't have to sit in that chair for hours anymore. I'm starting to get over that last taxol and it will be so nice not to go in and get another one this week. Debbie M.",

There is no change from the last scan--which is good, but I just found out more about the last scan. I knew I had a speck on the liver that they do not think is cancer, but it seems I also have 3 tiny nodules on the lung that may or may not be cancer. They are not showing any signs of metabolic (cancerous) activity right now. I will get scans again in 3 months. So...nothing bad right now, but not the all-clear NED I was hoping for. Ask for copies of all lab reports if you are like me and want to know everything. It was not good to learn from a nurse over the phone about the lung spots. I feel lots better now that I've seen the reports myself. Bonnie, I'd love to know how the tamaxofen and rads at the same time works out. My onc said I could do that also if I wanted to, but he doesn't usually do that. Please keep me posted. I feel like the more I do the sooner, the safer I'll feel. Take care, everybody. Debbie M.",

I go for scans next week and I'm hoping to hear the same. Mt hair came back silver and steel gray and it used to be reddish with bits of gray. A 6 year survivor friend says that hers changed back to black after a while. I kind of liked the silver, but I got the urge to get some Henna and did mine last weekend. I look much less sick! I wasn't expecting that, but my family likes it a lot and it makes me feel better too. The red is too red, but I can add chestnut next time I do it--which will have to b about every 8 weeks now if I don't want gray roots. If any of you try this at home, be sure to add 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to your henna mix or else it will not work well on gray. Hooray for hair. Any at all is great! Debbie M.

The only support group anywhere near here is a once a month night group 30 miles away and I don't like to drive at night. You guys are it for me, so thanks! Terry, can you describe some of the exercises? Lymphedema is one of those things I don't feel I've been thoroughly informed about and I know that radiation increases your chances. Is anyone else worrying about rads just a little? I went in today to get markings and they had me down for starting next Monday--not quite 2 weeks from the last chemo. I said I wanted to wait at least the full 2 weeks (everything I've read says 2 to 3 weeks is standard) so then the tech didn't want to mark me. They use some sort of super permanent marker instead of tattoos here. Anyway, we rescheduled markings for next week. Maybe I'm being a cowardly wimp, but if rads wear me down then I want to be completely over that last taxol before I start. I didn't get a neaulasta shot after the last treatment so I'm a lot less sore, but I do feel more worn out than usual. I've got that kind of icky taste in my mouth also. I'll be so glad to be over chemo, still no hair. I did get my PET scans today and I guess I'll be a little stressed until I get results in a couple of days. Take care everybody.

Debbie K., you are our leader and I can't wait until I can go out in public without my hat or hair. It's coming in, but I've still got bald spots and a receding hairline. Yikes! It is cold without hair. Terry, maybe you could try a hormone drug and see how you do on it. B45, I hope December goes better for you. Scans can be scary. I try not to think about them until I have to. I know that's not easy to do, but hang in there. Scans can bring good news. Shrink, I'm so happy you've shrunk. One thing I recommend is button-up shirts. That's all you will want to wear for a month or more. The surgery is over before you know it, literally. The first night is kind of rough. The first week when you have to deal with drains is not much fun. After that it gets easier. I miss my breast, but not much. I don't think I'll do reconstruction because I've heard that if you have a lot of nodes removed the reconstruction just collapses after a while. Too strange and not worth another surgery to me at this point. My silicone prosthesis is great, but I also have a light one I got from the cancer society catalog that I'm using a lot right now due to soreness from rads. It was also great right after surgery. Since you're have a bi-lateral you won't have to worry about lopsidedness. I am often cockeyed when I am wearing the light prosthesis, but oh well. When I wear the silicone one, you can't tell the difference. Rads will be over in 2 weeks. Hurray! Take care all. We finally got some rain here yesterday and we are all so happy. I would like to recomend a book on CD titled The Will to Live and Other Mysteries by Rachel Naomi Remen, M.D. It's not at all corny like much of that sort of stuff is. She's got me looking for small miracles and I've found 2 recently. There is a tiny plant growing out of the side of my aluminum siding garage and there was a volunteer cantalope in my wood burning pile where we burn fallen limbs. I think these both qualify as minor miracles because we've had a horrendous drought this year--more than 17 inches behind and officials for a while thought nearby Athens would be out of water by Christmas. The 2 cantaloupes we got from the volunteer vine were juicy and delicious. They were a very nice surprise. Debbie M.",

I thought I had it bad with the 30 miles into Athens. I highly recommend books on tape from your local library. That's my plan. I met with the rad onc this week and he was great. He says radiation cut chances of local recurrence from 1 in 5 to 1 in 30. I like those odds better. Terry & Gracie, I'm sorry about the tinglies that can be painful. I'm taking the B6 and have had very little of that, though they say it can be worse after treatment. What do your docs say about supplements?

My daughter's computer had coffee spilled on it, but it's back and so am I. I made friends with a woman who had recurrence in her lungs. (I told you all about her several posts back) She is er+ and her2- and Taxol has shrunk her lung tumors very succesfully. Taxol has saved her life, basically, so I don't feel bad about taking those Taxol treatments despite that study. It's possible they are helping me and I'll take all the help I can get. I've started rads this week and no problems yet, though the SEs usually take a couple of weeks to show up so we'll see. My rad onc wants to xray 2 times a week. Is anyone else doing that? It seems excessive. I have white fuzz, so it's good to hear that color may come in later. My volunteer hairs (thanks for the term Garnetann!) are red so I still look a little funny, but that's OK. I'm using 5,000 mg. of biotin for hairgrowth and it's working well. I waited until 2 weeks after the last Taxol and within 2 days of starting to use it, I had hair. For protection I'm taking E, D, B6, COQ10, Calcium, Zinc and a multi-v every day. I eat 14 of those small carrot sticks every day for my A. I take lots of C--at least 6,000. My doc says it's water soluble and won't build up. Linus Paulding did a lot of research on C in the seventies and it's supposed to be a great cancer killer. Some people recomend 10,000 to 20,000 mg. Ask your docs what they think. My onc doesn't believe in vitamins, but he said they were OK as long as I didn't take them the day of treatment, the day before or the day after. Before cancer I did not take any. The doc was so impressed with my B6 anti-neuropathy results that he is now recomending it for other patients. John Hopkins recently released a report saying that many cancers were the result of a vitamin deficiency. Who knows? But scaredy-cat me with all my awful lymph nodes is throwing everything I can find at the bad beast, even the kitchen sink if need be. Beating Cancer with Nutrition by Patrick Quillin is a pretty good book on the subject of supplements, though at times he seems a bit fanatical. Take care everybody. It's great to be back. I want to know more about port removal. Does it hurt? No one's even brought the subject up with me, but maybe after my next scans.... Are other people with ports in getting them flushed out on a regular basis? How often? The onc didn't say anything about it, but I think it's supposed to be done. Debbie M.",

I guess I'm just trying to say hang in there.  I do believe it will get better.  I do believe we'll move past this place and become calmer with every clean scan and clear mammagram.   Debbie M. ",

I went to the thread where they have hair growth one year out pictures and it was very encouraging. My mom always said patience is a virtue. I guess it's required in this situation. Glad to hear you're better, Cyndi. Bonnie, do you have to do rads and how soon do they start? I've heard they are nothing much compared to the chemo and I'm hoping that's so. I'm red haired so I burn pretty easy, but I'm already stocking up on ammunition in the form of aloe,etc. Debbie M.",

But only a minute group get the rib problems so I should really watch my overly active imagination. Everyone that I've actually talked to has had few complaints I then went to the success story thread and feel much, much better. I cut my decadon in half today and should have done it months ago. I feel great even though I had treatment today. I even went to a band showcase in town with the onc's permission. I finaly got to see my oldest performing with her flags with the 400 member UGA Redcoat Marching Band. My little baby was out there all grown up and looking so proud. I just had to cry I was so happy for her. Life is good. God is great. And we are all here. I'm so happy to be here. Bonnie, you are brave! Shots in the belly? Yeowch. We will be thinking about you. Will they take the port out or let you use it for the last one? Do they take the blood clot out or do all the shots/drugs make it dissolve? I know nothing about this, but I'm hoping hard that all goes well for you. Starfish, I think we just keep getting mammagrams and pray for the best. Debbbie M.",

ANYWAY, thanks for the pep talks everybody. I am feeling more optimistic today. These boards are a great place to let it all out and I thank you all for being here for me. It sounds as if many of us are getting close to the end of chemo. Dawn and Denise, does the herceptin take a long time to infuse and are the side effects rough? Will you do rads too? I almost went on a trial for it due to the lymph nodes but did not like the onc who was doing it and I didn't like the sound of the side effects. (I am a big fat chicken sometimes.) I'm sorry you guys have to keep going, but the herceptin is supposed to work really well for HER+. There's no evidence yet for lymph nodes. Congradulations Terry! Bonnie, I am listening for that bell. Kathleen, you are less than 1 month away from done. Shrink, good work with the shrinking! Thee chemo drugs do work and you've got proof. That is definitely good news. That martini mammagram van would do brisk business around here. What a great idea. I have pushed a lot of friends into getting mammagrams since I started this idea. Family history is not always an indicator, and the earlier the better. I don't mind the role of ancient mariner if it helps someone. I can't believe how much breast cancer there is out there. Lots of people I did not know had had it came out of the wordwork when news about mine got out on the grapevine. Have any of you also had that experience? Take care everybody, Debbie M.",

I can't wait for a long soak in a hot tub which should be good for my lymphedema, but with this drought that's going to be a once in a while treat. The CNA course sounds like a great idea. I'm sure you'll do great. I teach at a local tech college and my older students who have come back after being out for a long while are always my best ones. I'm going back to work in Jan. and looking forward to it. Cy, you are going through a very dark time and I'm so sorry for you and your family. You are being very brave and I will definitely have you all in my prayers. I hope the insurance co. comes through for you. Shrink, it sounds like you are getting over surgery very wel. That's great. We are slowly getting ready for Christmas here. We've got all the favorite music out but the decorations will have to wait for Sunday when I've got help and no one has a parade or concert or paegent they have to be in. It's a happy kind of hectic around here and I love it, but the littlest one has head lice and I'm spending a lot of time cleaning, recleaning, and picking out nits. Yech! I hate head lice! Does anyone out there have any suggestions? I've tried everything at the drug store and now we are going the mayonaise route--very messy. Oh well, lice are part of life and I guess we get the good with the bad. I'm determined to win this battle, but it ain't easy. I wonder if any of those strange internet products work? Does anybody know? Have a good weekend you all and if things aren't going well just tell yourself--at least I don't have head lice. This is one time when my near-baldness is actually an advantage.
