    "Content": "Breffne wrote: Hi. Mammogram in July found micro calcifications in two areas. I'm 43 so on young side & had all clear on previous mammogram nearly 3 years ago. Had stereotatic biopsy which came back as B4 with comment of possible invasive carcinoma. As I have always considered myself 'born lucky' the result was not what I expected. I had wire guided excision under general anaesthetic last week & am going for results tomorrow night. I still believe that whatever the pathology shows, I am still lucky, I have faith in my Higher Power and it will be ok. However I'm still a very lucky Mum & mental resilience can be tough to maintain 24 x 7. Unwanted thoughts & fears still sneak through. So that's why I wanted to thank you all for all your posts which are such a help. Sending you all love & strength. Log in to post a reply",
