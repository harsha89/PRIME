The surgery is tough for the kids as they can't cuddle and jump on you the same way for a few days...The pain for me as been pretty minimal but I am sure everyone is different. My son is pretty fascinated by the drain. I, on the other hand, cannot even bear to look at it. I took my wrappings off last night and took a shower. I was okay and did not flip out over the flat area which once was my breast. The bitch tried to kill me is what I keep saying to myself. I wil recommend purchasing a lanyard to place around your neck when you do take showers to help hold the drains. The closer the drain is to your body the less discomfort you may feel. Happy Sunday!",

I want to give everyone a heads up about making sure they drink lots of water with their meds. Last Monday I had to take myself to the ER because I was having severe heartburn and back pain. I could not take a drink of water without being in pain. You know the hospital pain scale? Well, this pain was like a 9. At the ER they did a chest x ray and a lung ct scan just in case there was cancer or a blood clot but that all came back clear. The gave me a GI numbing cocktail and that seemed to help and some ativan for the pain. I left with a diagnosis with inflamed esphagus and to follow up with a GI doc. Today, I went to the GI doc and he is almost sure that one of meds got stuck and burned some ulcers in my GI track. He believes it was the Cleomyacin. This whole experience has been worse than the masectomy. I am now down 14 lbs in a week and a half because it hurts to eat. I go for an endoscope next week to make sure the med still is not lodged in there somewhere. For all those facing surgery.......good luck. You can do it! This will be one more step to check off in your road to wellness!",

I get my drain out on Friday. For those of you who have had theirs taken out, please tell me your xperience. I have had a rough time since Monday and not from my surgery. I was having severe chest pain and upper back pain and burping. The pain was so severe that I had to go to the er. They did some heart tests, lung scans, and chest xray and those turned out good. Looks like I have esphogusitis. It happens to chemo kids because of the rapid cell division. It is terrible and it is hard for me to eat or drink. They say it should resolve itself in a week or so. This was NOT the way I planned on shedding those extra pounds. Good luck to all facing surgery this week. Prayers for everyone.s",

I feel like I had more pain from the birth of my child. I am walking around and doing fine. A bit tired, but I think that is from getting woken up about 2 times last night to take vitals and to drain my tube. My BS said she was pleased and she felt that my body responded well to the Chemo. My tumor was 10 cm and it had shrunk it completely. It had just turned into soft tissue. She also said my nodes looked good. Now, just waiting on the path report....praying hard it comes out as expected.....please! The pain is not bad at all. When I got out of recovery they asked my if I wanted any pain medication. I asked them what my choices were and the nurse replied...morphine or percoset. I said, well, I have always wanted to try morphine so let's try that. I guess I was channeling my old wild rocker high school years on that one. Side note. All it did was made me sleepy. The drain is what makes me crazy. I have a phobia of things attached to me. Reason as to why I am probably one of the only chemo patients at my clinic without a port. It does not hurt...it just feels weird. I am icing like crazy to prevent swelling. I love the ice pak they give you. I do feel a bit bizzaro with my uni boob. When my hubby and I were in the elevator to go home I asked him...did you ever think you would marry a girl with only one boob. He replied...no, I thought I would marry a girl like on the movie Total Recall with 3 boobs. So...if anyone has any questions ask me or private message me....I promise to be honest and my UMX experience. Thanks for all ur support and good luck lilylady.....I am praying hard for you!!!!!!!",

I mean or real,,,,who would think that I would be losing a body part tomorrow? I laugh when I say this. My humor is slightly morbid. My father assures me that I am only losing fatty nasty tissue. Gotta love my dad, I had to tell my 5 year old that I was losing my breast, I couldn't hide that nor did I want to lie to him. I thought about it carefully and  said it will grow back. I said Yes, kind of! He was so okay with it. He has been awesome through all this. The only thing I has had trouble with was me losing my hair. He was a notorious hair twirler when we would cuddle together. For my Ohio gals....I live in Cincinnati, right by Kings Island. My BS says that UMX is one night's stay; however, the Pre-Op nurse says I could go home that evening. Fine by me...GET ME OUT OF THERE! My surgery is an arrival at 5am and a 7am surgery time. All I can say is that they better have that IV full of coffee because I am nasty without it. I will post soon. Requesting all your thoughts, prayers, and good vibes.  ",

When Katie first was diagnosed, her #1 goal was to see him turn 10. She felt that he would be old enough to remember her, and strong enough to cope with her loss. She enjoyed some wonderful times and battled through much adversity to make sure that happened, but she accomplished her goal. She fought hard for 5 years and made lifelong memories for me, Leo, and her friends. Her legacy of living for the moment lives on with all who knew her. We love you Katie Jo and we will see you again. My wife started coming to these boards about five years ago. I originally signed up for her account to find out what I could do to help her during her chemo treatments. She then took the account over. She made many friends and lost many over that time. She did not come on much after Lilylady passed as it affected her deeply.

I didn't want Marinol because I saw a woman in the chemo lounge who was on it and she was talking all kinds of weird stuff. I asked the nurse if she is okay and she said she was on Marinol. I chose to smoke it because you can control the dosage. I wish it was legalized here in Ohio. It's benefits far outweigh the cons. I don't do it if I am around my son or when he is in my care. Usually after his bedtime. Then I eat ALOT and catch up on all my DVR recordings. My MO says to me \"whatever works is fine with me\". My weight now is 124. I don't like to go below 127. I have not had a supply for about a week now and have lost 3 pounds. Getting resupplied today. The Megace works too. It was originally created for AIDS patients to increase their appetite. It does work but I always regurgitate. My hubby does not mind because I eat and laugh at all his jokes. And like I said before I can control it.",
