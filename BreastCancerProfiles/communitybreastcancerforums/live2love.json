I had my mammogram this morning, so now I await the results. You do sound very scared and perhaps a wee bit paranoid and heck who isn't! I am researching the www \"just in case\" I get unfavourable news so hopefully I can be prepared and if it's nothing, well lucky me !  The time you are waiting seems to be forever for an appt and yes if I was you and as anxious I would definitely push for an earlier appt and that way you can get it over and done with. \"Done & dusted\" so to speak I was lucky, I had an appt offer the next day but I chickened out! ha! was too soon for me, so I waited the next appt which was approx a 4 week wait, had it this morning NZ time. Was easy peezy, not uncomfortable or unpleasant as many have said. The lady who did my screening was just awesome! she made me feel really comfy and we spent most of the time joking. Best wishes for a speedy appt date, get it over and done with. Looks like a good crowd in here for support one way or the other. ((L2L))",

Love this site and have trawled through reading loads of posts and threads, awesome stuff! It is so sad to read of so much cancer, it's likened to a \"modern day plague\" in my way of thinking. I too await tests which are still a few weeks away. Have a suss lump in right breast, warmth feeling in right breast and tenderness in the right breast and a tenderness right armpit but no lump. I'm generally sooooooooooo tired it drives me to feel yuck at times, but other than that I feel great, positive and are currently on a weight-loss journey. (I am 48) My younger sister now 44 was diagnosed with BC 8 years ago and has had an 8 year battle of fighting numerous new spreads, hers was an aggressive pos BC at the onset but she has beat all odds to date! Her specialist said in his 22 years she is the only patient ever to live past 4 months of the 3rd battle which she has fought the past 12 + months! She is unwell at present and this past 6 - 12 months have changed her personality for the worst. She has become a horrid, cruel, vindictive woman which has caused much heartache. I have heard this can be quite common towards the end ? What are others experiences in this ? My sister and I were once inseparable and the bestest friends in the world and 7 months ago she blamed me for her cancer and cut me off with such hatred. She wants nothing to do with me and all I can say to her is that I love her and no matter what she has said to hurt me I forgive her and will always be there for her if she needs me. Now several months later I face tests for BC in the same breast! ha! My Doc is very concerned given my sisters history and we have the same doctor, so I'm off for a mammogram but it's a long wait, 16th March. For me, I have decided I won't be having any kind of treatment though, I will do \"heal thyself\" through diet and positive affirmations. Has anyone here opted for natural healing rather than chemo and radiation? Phewwwwwwww, well that was long winded ..... Would love to read your response and thanks for having me Life is short! Break the rules! Forgive quickly! Love truly, Laugh uncontrollably.. . and never regret anything that made you smile Log in to post a reply",
