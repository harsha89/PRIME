After the first 9 months the nodes had gone back within normal range and the bone lesions had become stable. I then had almost a year off meds, except for Zometa; when a CT scan showed progression in the nodes (chest wall, mediastinal) in July '08 I again did the same tx and am now off meds again. I had become metastatic while on hormonals and after stage IV dx did Faslodex, but had an excisional biopsy in Dec. '07 which showed only 5% ER sensitivity, so apparently hormonals will not work for me unless I get the new estradiol tx and the receptors turn positive again. If hormonals work for you, you should probably exhaust that avenue before moving on to something more evil. Although Xeloda is not bad, it definitely has its SE's. Sorry to hear of your progression. Keep on truckin girl, I'm sendin you (((HUGS)))!!!",

I did Xeloda last year, 8 cycles, combined with Avastin and Zometa, still on Zometa and Faslodex. So it is probably the Zometa that is showing the improvement since it is a bone strengthener. The chemo kills the cancer cells, but if there is bone that has been eaten away, the chemo does nothing for that, is how I understand it.",

I don't know, I don't speak for Komen either. And, I guess I was a little cheerleader-ish in my original post, which may have been annoying. But I know what walking the 3-Day in '02, after I had finished my chemo, did for me. It made me feel like I was alive, like I could get past the cancer and live my life, and like I was helping others by raising the money. Now that I am stage IV, I understand all that implies, and thus I feel so grateful to be able to do this, now while I am well enough.  If I can help, I want to, and if it makes me feel good about myself and my capabilities, then I'm going to do that for myself.

There are plenty of things that piss me off too, about the medical establishment, the pharmaceutical industry, and the insurance companies, all of whom seem to control whether we live or die. My doing the Komen is a way for me to take a small measure of control back. I am exercising my choice about SOMETHING at least, and that makes me feel better about my situation. Whatever your feelings about the foundation, the walk is a wonderful, empowering experience. Again, I am really sorry I pissed you off. Yours is the first negative reaction I've had.

An attorney came to lecture about special-needs students and the school's responsibilities towards them. She put up a title slide that said, in very big, bold letters: (ready???)

I know at some point I will say enough is enough, but for the moment I have to take what is available and hope it works. There's nothing we can do about it except make a lot of noise and DEMAND that our governments fund more research.

You know something that looks like a mass could be enlarged lymph nodes on the chest wall, possibly?? I just had a PET yesterday and of course can't get results right away. I am stage IV w/mets to bones all over the place. I see three docs: one my PCP who I have been with since forever and 2 oncs; one I have been with since my first DX in '01 and the other is a sounding board/fresher view, only seeing him since Jan. Both of the docs I have been with for a while poo-pooed the PET when the new onc ordered it, they said there was nothing more to be learned that we don't already know from CT and bone scans. What do you all think? Is a PET that different that it will show something that the others won't? The PCP said often PET scans are just \"wacky\" and her husband is a radiologist.  I was on Xeloda for 7 months, had 2 stable CT's and after almost 3 months now I have a new lump on my chest wall. So I am afraid I will have to go back to Xeloda too. Going to ask my onc to do the 7 days on, 7 days off schedule this time, the HFS was killer and according to the latest onoline conference the first week is when the drug really blasts the cancer.

I would think the decreased air pressure at high elevations would be a risk, that's why you wear the sleeve/gauntlet when you fly. l don't see why X/C skiing would be any better, in fact because of the increased heart rate you'd want to make sure you do some large-lever arm movements as you cool down, just like you would with aerobics, to prevent fluids from pooling in the extremities. Raise your hands in the air and shake them, do side-to-side arcs. But hey, I hope you enjoy your skiing, I can't downhill any more due to bone mets; the scans are looking good but still show spots here and there, so I am afraid to. I will snowshoe and X/C this winter. Ironically, after snowshoeing last winter I stepped on my own shoe in the parking lot and fell right on the pavement on my right hip where there is/was a met. Nothing happened except a bruised butt. Anyway do some dark blues and blacks for me!!",

I continue to try to educate others about breast cancer. To answer your question, as I understand it yes, even though your breast is cancer-free, some cancer cells may have gotten loose in your bloodstream or lymph and now have shown up as metastases. I had a mastectomy but cancer cells traveled to other sites so now I'm stage IV too. This damn crazy disease makes no sense sometimes. I'm sorry you had bad results. Keep coming back here for love and support. We all understand what it's like. Best to you...((((hugs))))",

Kimberly, I did the same chemo regimen as you 6 yrs ago when it was still in trials. I was ILC stage 2, 3 nodes positive, Er+, PR-, her/2 -. They also told me that if I opted for a mast I would not have to do rads, which greatly influenced my decision. Following that I did Tamoxifen 2 and 1/2 years then was switched to Aromasin for 2 yrs. Then I had a recurrence, nodules on the sternum, chest wall, and neck, and mets to bones all over the place. Do I wish I'd done rads? Maybe. But as you stated earlier, radiation is very damaging to the body. Of course so is the chemo. After the stage IV dx I had a drug-resistance test done on one of the nodes in the neck after it was removed. It came back that Taxotere was one of the drugs to which it was resistant. They did not have the oncotype dx 6 yrs ago, of course. Anyway in hindsight, if they had told me to do the rads I probably would have, but they said it wasn't necessary, and here I am stage IV. I am well right now but agree with you and others who have posted that it's still something of a crapshoot whether we will have a recurrence or not. Best of luck to you and I hope you can come to a decision you are comfortable with and not second-guess yourself.",

Remember the old Eagles song, Desperado...? \"You're losin' all your highs and lows, ain't it funny how the feeling goes away...\" Well that song was about someone who just didn't feel. Now I sometimes want to be there, in numbness, in a world where nothing bothers me, no pain, no damn tests, no cancer. I guess we'll all be there sometime. But right now, get mad, do not let cancer take your spirit; get off the couch and do something you enjoy. And tomorrow, go outside and breathe the air, take some deep breaths and face the new day. Appreciate that there IS a new day. Live as well as you can, for as long as you can, whatever that means for you. That's my goal. We are all here for you.

Also Udderly Smooth seems to work for a lot of us. Some say don't massage it in but I always did and both of those helped. Put on cotton socks and gloves and leave them on as long as you can. If you have cuts put some Neosporin in there too. Is this your first cycle? Call your onc tomorrow! There are different  theories about how Xeloda should be taken, e.g. 1 week on/1 week off versus 2 weeks on/1 week off. My onc had to reduce my dosage twice and I had to take additional weeks off due to the HFS but the drug did the trick for me. There is a lot on these boards about Xeloda. Good luck to you, hope you get some relief soon.(((Hugs!)))",

I went to the Philadelphia location, which is newer than the others and my opinion was that they had too many patients and not enough employees. Communication between the docs, the case manager, and myself was not good. I hope they have their act more together by now. I went there five times in all and each time it just made me more stressed out than feeling better about my situation. In fairness, I only had one procedure there, which was an excisional biopsy; other than that, I received no treatment at CTCA but used them more as a second opinion. I did not feel that the doc I saw had spent much time reviewing my case. Could it be that since I really wasn't receiving much treatment there, thus they were not making a lot of money off me, I was not treated as well as others who make CTCA their main source of treatment?? I spent a lot of time waiting around and then had to rush to the airport or to another appt. I did not feel pampered, but on the other hand I did not feel as though they were holding out any false promises. I think it depends on how sick you are, too. I was not sick, although being stage IV is serious, and so I was not hovered over or offered special help or anything. I like my oncologist here at home, so the fact that CTCA was not necessarily a great experience for me is not that troubling. However, I would keep my options open to return if my situation gets substantially worse.",

Yes I will take time to forget cancer for a few days and enjoy my Christmas. I will love my grandkids and try to help them get through their teenage years and their parents' divorce without major damage. I will go with my DH to Mexico for a week and soak up the sun and the ruins and try not to worry that it may be the last time I am able to do it.  I will try not to obsess about my cancer and controlling my destiny, but I will visit a Mayan healer and internalize the experience so I can remember it whenever I need to. I will come back renewed and ready to fight the beast for another year, or for as long as I can. Thank you, thank you. Peace and love to all of you...you mean so much to me.",

I did tamoxifen, aromasin, was dx w/mets to bones and chest wall nodes Jan. '07. A node removed for an excisional biopsy  showed the same hormone profile. I just had another chest wall mass removed; the pathology came back as cancer, but no hormone results yet. I have been on Faslodex for about 5 mos., and my onc says it has a notoriously slow response, in other words it takes it a while to really work. So this latest node probably slid in between the end of Xeloda (July) and the Faslodex getting up to speed. (It popped up in Oct.) Now the question: if this new mass has a different hormone sensitivity, e.g. it is ER-, should I stay on the Faslodex? Should it be assumed that there still may be ER+ cells running around? I asked my onc this and she said we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. She is great one for reining me in when I have questions about what will happen IF... when it hasn't happened yet! Anybody have any ideas about this or been in the same situation? Thanks, have a great holiday season! Don't sing of Yesterday, Yesterday is gone; Tomorrow isn't written, Make Today your song.

I was on Aromasin when I was dx with stage 4 last Jan, so I supposed that my onc first wanted to see what Xeloda could do about the mets, then after that put me back on a hormonal. (Don't know if that is typical or not.) Obviously the Aromasin did nothing for me, since the mets grew right through it. So that's why I am wondering about whether Faslodex is going to do me any good, especially if either the original ER sensitivity was low, or if it has decreased since original dx. I don't see my onc until after the first of the year but I never have seen my original path reports so that is something I am curious about now. The first time around, I just figured I would do what she thought best, but now that I'm stage 4 I am way more serious about informing myself and being a partner in making treatment decisions. Luckily she doesn't feel threatened by this, although she tends to focus on right now rather than long-term, which bothers me a little. After having suffered through Adriamycin and Taxotere, both of which have been shown to have been ineffective against my brand of cancer, I am even less willing to just take a med or treatment if its chance of success is not high, or just because it's the new drug du jour. Anyway OZ, I have my fingers crossed for you and your nodes shrinking. Have you done Xeloda? It is very tolerable at the right dose, which may take a couple of months to figure out, but it worked for me. Happy holidays, hope you're feeling well!",

I saw my surgeon the other day and asked for my original path report; turns out my original tumor was ER+ 50% and PR 0%, which I did not know before this. The tissue that was just taken showed ER 5% and PR 0%. The original tumor was her/2  neg, but the her/2 results on this one are not back yet. So, my dilemma is this...do I continue the Faslodex? Yes, I WAS on Xeloda from Jan-July and the scans have borne out that it did its job. I am still on Faslodex and Zometa, both of which are very easy. Now another question: what difference does the PR positive or negative result make? I had always thought the original mass was PR+ . Would my treatment have been different if it had actually been PR+? Or is the treatment plan more driven by the ER and her/2 results? I'm really not trying to second-guess my onc but after having gone through those 2 chemo poisons all for naught (adriamycin and taxotere), I'm very intense about my treatment plan. My onc is great but she really doesn't take the time to discuss such fine points with me. I was on Avastin for about 5 mos. but she took me off it after 2 stable bone scans. And now that the FDA has un-approved it, I don't know if she will put me back on it if necessary. I will ask about trials when I see her in Jan. I know I am in a relatively good situation right now compared to many, but obviously I want to be as informed as I can so I don't look back in another 6 yrs. and regret that I had just been a good girl and followed the crowd. Thanks all for your responses and I'll let you know asap about the her/2, hoping it's still neg!",

For even stone cannot the wind and rain withstand And mighty mountain peaks in time reduce to sand. What we were, we are; what we had, we have. A conjoined past, imperishably present. So when you walk the woods where once we walked together And scan in vain the dappled bank beside you for my shadow,  Or pause where we always did upon the hill to gaze across the land, And spotting something, reach by habit for my hand, And finding none, feel sorrow start to steal upon you, Be still. Close your eyes. Breathe. Listen for my footfall in your heart. I am not gone but merely walk within you.",

The people in the rads dept. say they can't use the port for CT and bone scans, which is of course what I have most frequently. They use an injector which apparently puts too much pressure on the port, or maybe on the vein or line into it. I did get them to use the port for a PET last week, but I had to run back and forth to the oncology dept. because there was no RN in radiology who was allowed to access it. (Then I was told after the fact that once you've been injected with the radioactive isotope, you should not walk around becasue it will go to the muscles!!) How is it that these techs are qualified to try and start an IV line on someone who is a very difficult stick, but not trained to use the needle required for a port?? Makes no sense to me. Anyway, another patient told me that she has had her mediport for something like 14 yrs. and that she puts up such a fuss when she has a scan that they finally agree to manually inject the contrast media into her port. Anyone else have any insight into this situation? I am tired of getting stuck 5 times by 3 different techs every time I have to have a scan, just because there's no RN around or whatever.  Also, I was told the last time that if I am very well-hydrated when I come in the veins will pop up better. Of course, you're not allowed to have anything by mouth for 12 hours. Such BS!!!  Don't sing of Yesterday, Yesterday is gone; Tomorrow isn't written, Make Today your song. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Dec 14, 2007 07:28PM - edited Dec 15, 2007 03:42AM by AliceJean Hey Bimmer, here's my edited version...your letter is so powerful. Thank you. Casualties of War I thought that perhaps today, a few days before my dear Diane, my wife of 32 years, passes away, I'd write a short commentary about breast cancer. Tonight I saw on the news the highlights of the big San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference. Although I admire those dedicated men and women who work diligently to find a cure for this plague that is killing over 40,000 people yearly, I feel that oncology is like voodoo and oncologists are like witch doctors. I'm no expert on either subject; but when you consider the slime, poultices, and poisons that witch doctors use, and compare that to the cut, poison with chemo and radiate philosophy that is widely used and accepted in oncology today, I'm sure you can see the comparison. It's still a guessing game.  The highlights of the San Antonio Show: first, these geniuses identified the need to individualize cancer treatment, tailoring it specifically to the nature of the tumor and the patient being treated. Wow. Hundreds of the best-known and most-respected breast cancer people in the world get together to really do something about breast cancer, and that is what they decide?  The other big news flash was something else they should have figured out a long time ago: one of the most commonly-used class of chemotherapy agents, ANTHRACYCLINES, is only effective on about 8% of breast cancer tumors. That means that 92% of breast cancer patients that received anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, (Adriamycin), epirubicin (Ellence), and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) suffered the sometimes terrible side effects of these drugs FOR NO REASON AT ALL. So, here today at the end of 2007, no huge strides have been made in treating or curing breast cancer. Lots of new drugs, but do we know when to use them? Mankind has made great strides in many areas, such as technology. But we have not moved ahead very rapidly at all in treating or curing breast cancer. The Vietnam Memorial Wall has 58,256 names on it; men and women that died during the nine years of the Vietnam War. In the year 2007 it is expected that 40,910 women will die from breast cancer. In ONE year. If 40,910 soldiers were killed this year in Iraq and Afghanistan, there would be a huge public outcry. There needs to be a damned public outcry about finding a cure for breast cancer! My God, don't we see the numbers? Don't we all need to get mad as hell? Priorities must change. More research must be done. Governments must allocate more money to research and development. People must see what this terrible disease is doing to women, their men, their loved ones, and generations to come. Forty thousand nine hundred and ten women, and my Diane will be one. I am disappointed in oncology, technology, misplaced priorities, money that is wasted, the San Antonio Breast Cancer Conference, and most of all in losing the one person in the world that I really cannot live without. She is much more than just one of 40,910, to me.  Bimmer, I will submit this with your permission...",

Some people are just ignorant and may not ever be any other way. I despair of them ever reaching a maturity that would allow for compassion or empathy. After my mastectomy in 2001, I continued gardening and mowing the lawn in tank tops, because I like to be healthy looking and have some tan (yes, I wear sunscreen, but don't wear my prosthetic...too hot). Every once in a while a car full or a gang of bicycle thugs will go by my yard and wolf whistle or hoot or laugh uproariously. If they are still near enough to see me, I give them the finger. If not, I stew about it for a couple of minutes and then just try to let it go and just say to myself, some kids are just stupid and there's nothing you can do about it. So why let them win by letting it bother me? It's my yard and if I want to wear a tank top and no prostethic, that's my business and screw them. I know it's hard but I just don't think they deserve to take up this much of my thinking and emotions. Why waste time on assholes? It won't change anything but my outlook and make me more negative or hurt. I hope this makes sense...it works for me most times but there are always other times that it does hurt...I just try to make those times go away quickly and distract myself with something that makes me feel like I am still powerful. Best of luck to you Stephanie, if it makes you feel better to talk to the mother about it, you should do so, but don't expect anything from the kid.",

So it will be more tolerable with only one week on. They calculate the dosage based on your BMI so we pleasingly plump ladies start off with a high dose. My advice is to go with it and see how you tolerate it. By the 3rd cycle or so you should have a pretty good idea...the se's are cumulative. My onc had no problem reducing the dosage when necessary and from what I have read this is very common. Best of luck with this, Xeloda has been a good drug for me and many others.  ((((HUGS))))",

      "Content": "Jul 11, 2009 06:52PM - edited Jul 11, 2009 06:54PM by AliceJean Hi ladies, this looks ike a good thread for me to vent on...thanks in advance for listening/reading! My husband of 18 yrs. professes to love me. I love him too. We have not been intimate for some time...we both have issues. Lately he has begun to hide things from me...First it was that he was going to host a party at our house for a group of his friends (we have always had separate friends and interests and it's really never been much of a problem). I'm now in CA @ my daughter's place, she's going to have a baby ASAP. Problem?? He scheduled this party during the 2 weeks he knew I would be gone. I only found out because I went to use the computer after he had been on, and he had left the page up where he had invited this group to our house. (His way of telling me...???) He had said NOTHING to me about this. I discovered it on our wedding anniversary, so he had been planning a party without me, behind my back,  on a day that was special to me. When I confronted him, his response was that he thought it was best to have the party while I was gone because I don't like those people (not true...I don't like ONE of them, because he encourages my husband to drink, but the rest are OK). Also he says he does not have to ask my permission to have his friends at our house. Well, the house was exclusively mine for a long time; it was my home, was left to me by my parents whom I cared for in their last years, and he came to live there when we married.  I have only put his name on the paperwork since I have been stage IV, which is 2 yrs. I am the one who has decorated, sided, roofed, and cared for this home. I'm the one who pays the mortgage. I really don't like the idea of a large group of people who don't care if they drag mud through my house stomping through my home when I'm not there. (Yeah, control freak...I know.) Asking permission and being honest and letting me know he is having people over are, in my mind, 2 different things. Of course he says he knew how I would react, negatively, so he deliberately kept this from me until I discovered it by accident. He also told me if I want to know what he is planning I should read his blog. We had a big whoop-de-do about it and finally compromised by scheduling the party after I'm back. At first he flat-out refused to change the date. I said if he held the party while I was gone anyway, to make sure he locked the house when he moved out. So I agreed to host the party for people I am not really friendly with, on a different date. I will end up doing most of the work. The first day I was in CA w/my daughter, he and I spoke on the phone and he told me he was going the next day with this guy (yup, the one I don't like) to Kelly's island, a summer resort on Lake Erie. The premise was that they were going to survey the island for rare plants, hoping to protect it from further development (they belong to a land conservancy organization). Well, Kelly's is a really neat place to go. I would have liked to go too. But once again, he had previously scheduled this trip during the time I'm gone. I would not even have hung with them, I would have done my own thing, had I been invited. But he \"thought it best\" to keep this from me until I was gone. When I got upset about it on the phone, he just refused to consider that he is being sneaky and said that I overreact. I have always felt that if a person lies about one thing, it stands to reason s/he will be deceitful about other things. I have begun to distrust him. I feel as though he is preparing for my death by doing these things when he knows I'm not available. Yes, I'm stage IV, but I have not been very sick. I have had the good luck to be off meds from April until now, and I feel good. I have knee issues and he probably feels I would hold him back if hiking is involved. But we always so enjoyed that, together. Had he not hidden these things from me I would not be so upset, but now I wonder what else he is hiding, and what lies ahead. Can I even depend on him to take care of me when I AM dying? Once when I was flat out on the couch from chemo, it happened to be New Year's eve, and he asked if I would mind if he went out with some friends. Hell yes I minded! I wanted him there with me, hoping the next year would be better. I have expressed these concerns to him and he does not even dignify or validate my feelings. He says I am totally off base and twisting the facts because I feel sorry for myself, and want him with me every minute...not true. We've always done things separately with our different groups of friends, as well as together. Honestly I am sometimes glad to get him out of the house. But since stage IV, yes, I have a heightened sense of every day being important, and while I am well enough to do things that we both enjoy, I would like him to want me with him. Apparently he doesn't, and then sneaks and lies about it, and that's what hurts. So what do you think? Am I holding him too tightly? Overreacting? If he had let me know about these things he was planning, yes, I would have been upset that he was planning them for when I'm gone. But I would have gotten over it, because truthfully I probably would have chosen not not to go to Kelly's and to keep a pretty low profile when his friends were at our house.  It's the sneakiness and the refusal to consider or care how he makes me feel that really bother me. I know, this is turning out to be waaaaay too long. Any insight you all could give me would be appreciated.",

But here's what I think: we have poisoned our planet to the extent that it is now poisoning US. There are distinct clusters of BC, MS, other chronic and debilitating diseases; which suggests that environmental factors are either largely to blame, or make the incidence of cancer higher in those already predisposed to it by some other risk factors. No one knows what is in our soil, our water, our air...residual chemicals from long ago, possibly. So here's another totally unrelated question: do any of you know of any research tying one's blood type to incidence of cancer?",
