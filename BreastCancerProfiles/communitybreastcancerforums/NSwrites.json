I'm expecting results early next week from my exams (they were ordered stat), but am still stumped that they opted not to do any biopsy. I know they measured at least a dozen places on the ultrasound - perhaps they were all visibly simple cysts? I keep going back and forth in my head between \"they found nothing and will have to do additional tests to locate the reason for my dark discharge\" and \"they saw obviously what the problem is and didn't need to biopsy to dx.\" One thing I did wonder... they couldn't find my old apocrine cysts from 3 years ago. Could they have ruptured? Could my dark discharge be old blood from that rupture? I cling to hope that something mild like this is the case! But am prepared that even if there's no clear problem on mammo, I may still need other tests like the duct test with the wire or whatever... *shudder* oh well, whatever must be done. I'm going to try to stop wracking my brain on this for now. Fingers crossed for b9 results for everyone else waiting!",

He said the lump I felt was a fatty lipoma and nothing to worry about, but that my dimpling is caused by something else. He described it as a \"cluster of cysts\" and used a word I couldn't understand, it started with \"myo\" something. I asked him to repeat the name of it but he wouldn't, kept telling me it's nothing to worry about but he'll explain it to my doctor. Then he said I'll need a followup u/s in a few months to track its growth. I'm confused. Never heard the word he used before, and even tho I asked four times, he wouldn't slow down and tell me. It worries me. But then, everything about this situation worries me... Sorry, needed to vent. I'm happy they did the mammo, but a little uneasy that the u/s was incomplete in the first place and they would have just sent me away had I not pushed.

Doctor recommended a followup US/mammo in 4 months, so here we are and I will have the next batch of boobie pancakes and icy cold lube tests in a couple weeks. Over the last two weeks I have gotten random shooting pains from the area of concern out thru my nipple. Literally like something sharp is stabbing out through the nipple. I mentioned this at my doc, he said he wasn't happy about it but not to be in a panic about it either.  So tonight I was making popcorn and I got the pain again but it was so severe it put me down. Like stumble-to-a-chair severe. I'm just really shaken by the experience. It tapered off after about a minute, and there's no residual soreness. Anyway, I guess I'm wondering if I should talk to my doc and try to get a rush on the tests, or if this is normal with cysts? Anyone else have experience with this kind of pain, whether related to cancer or not? Thanks in advance, I really appreciate being able to come here for support... Log in to post a reply",

The doctor said it's at 9:30 on my breast, so I laid down and felt the area until I figured out what he was talking about. Hard lumps feel different inside the breast, more so than thru the fingertips. Its like this hard thing (mine is like a quarter of a walnut, bumpy and long) that digs into you when you rub it around. Of course every lump is different but I think it's important to really get to know what something concerning feels like, since I didn't even realize this was an issue and thought something else was. Once I get the report from the doc, if it's anything bad, I'm gonna offer all my female friends the chance to feel it so they know lol... ",

I'm not actually sure if it's enlarged at all, she just commented it was over 1cm and it stuck out as the only concerning observation. I appreciate hearing that others have experienced enlarged nodes that were nothing. Mods - I'm a little confused I think, and I apologize. I thought it was okay to come to these forums and seek similar experiences? I only intended to see if anyone has heard similar comments during their scan, and share what that amounted to (if anything) to ease my waiting stress (as they have done). Did I violate a rule by mentioning my scan experience? I know it's not acceptable to share pics, etc, and I certainly know members cannot try to diagnose, but I didn't realize it wasn't okay to seek other members' experiences regarding lymph node size. I'm sorry, and will try to figure out what is acceptable to ask here, since I seem to keep asking questions that yield me a slap on the wrist. It's very frustrating. I am not trying to have unrealistic expectations of the community, and am not sure how my posts keep coming across that way. But thank you so much for the link, it's quite informative.",

With my family history, breast cancer under age 35, my doctor is taking it seriously and watching it closely. And he was very gentle about it too, equally concerned with how I'm feeling about it all. Anyone else ever encounter a diagnosis of apocrine metaplasia? I'm BIRADS 3 but testing it more closely due to family history.",

The radiologist had the U/S done first because I am 28, and decided they got enough pictures with the U/S to skip the repeated mammo because it was just done 4 months ago. The radiologist was vague because he wants me to see my doc of course, but it will be 7 - 10 days until the official report reaches my doc's office. The radiologist said he didn't see anything he didn't expect to see in terms of growth of the cysts, but the tech mentioned \"lymph node over 1cm\" on that side in my armpit. Any thoughts on what that means? I know lymph node involvement isn't good, but is it indicative of cancer, or is over 1cm normalish? Any feedback would be appreciated. I am calling my doc Monday to book my results appointment. Thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",

Mammo and ultrasound showed nothing alarming. Doctor sent a requisition for a galactogram. Radiology office lost requisition, gave me a bunch of wrong info, etc etc, finally got me in for the galactogram last week (Feb 20), and the radiologist could not perform the galactogram because he could not get the needly thingy inserted into the duct. Today, I saw my family doctor to ask what the next step is. He said, \"Nothing.\" .... I asked him to elaborate and he replied that because the radiologist couldn't get into the duct there must not be anything wrong. And because I'm not having the discharge spontaneously at the moment, whatever the problem was has clearly resolved. I pressed for a referral to a breast specialist and he said \"You just saw the specialist.\" So, is a breast specialist not a thing? All I saw was a radiologist, who called the galactogram obsolete anyway. No test was actually done because he couldn't get the needle inserted! I felt completely stupid. I pressed again, and he said he would refer me to a \"general surgeon who does some breast work.\" Which I feel is unacceptable. Do you agree or disagree? Why? I accepted the referral because it was clear I would make no more progress, and then I went to my gynecologist's office and arranged to see the doctor who does paps and breast exams. I want to go into that appointment knowing what to ask for. Any thoughts or advice are welcome... like I am really, really frustrated, and wondering if I shouldn't have pushed to have this looked at again, or what. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Apr 12, 2014 10:55AM - edited Apr 12, 2014 10:58AM by NSwrites Hi Julianna, I started a new thread but should have just continued here: That was a FRUSTRATING appointment. After the U/s tech saw me, I was told to go on my way without a mammo. I pushed to speak directly with the radiologist who re-did the u/s and found a few areas of suspicion and decided to do the mammo. He said the lump I felt was a fatty lipoma and nothing to worry about, but that my dimpling is caused by something else. He described it as a \"cluster of cysts\" and used a word I couldn't understand, it started with \"myo\" something. I asked him to repeat the name of it but he wouldn't, kept telling me it's nothing to worry about but he'll explain it to my doctor. Then he said I'll need a followup u/s in a few months to track its growth. I'm confused. Never heard the word he used before, and even tho I asked four times, he wouldn't slow down and tell me. It worries me. But then, everything about this situation worries me... Sorry, needed to vent. I'm happy they did the mammo, but a little uneasy that the u/s was incomplete in the first place and they would have just sent me away had I not pushed. I'm 28 with a strong family history of BC under age 35. Anyway. Thanks for listening.  EDITED TO CLARIFY: They did do the mammo in the end, which confirmed this myo-something. They want to track its growth. But I think I will push for a biopsy.",

The only \"myo\" something I can find is \"myoepithelioma\" which sounds like what the rad said, but is EXTREMELY rare in the breast so I'm not inclined to assume (and research more) that's what it is until I see the report. Thanks for your passion on this. I've already learned I'm my own best advocate since the rad didn't even want to do the mammo, and had he not done it, I wouldn't even know this issue was here. I'll stay confident and get answers. :-)",
