I think it is easier to get it after tx, the SE's just blend in with all the others.

I think that is more likely with the TAC combo, and I think there are only a couple of us getting all 3 at once. Your glands are probably swollen cuz they're fighting off an infection... nice to know those WBC's are working! An NSAID like Advil should help, though it will mask any fever you may be having, which the doc's don't like. I go to work after tx, but it is more from necessity that by choice. I am not very productive the first day or 2 back because it is hard to concentrate and hard to stand for so long. I muddle through, and then by day 6 I am usually feeling better. Chrisc433 - I also had lumpectomy, partially due to size (1.4cm) and location (upper rt quad) which made it easy to conserve the breast. At the time, I had no family hx of BC so this seemed a good way to go. I have since learned that my 1/2 sister my mom gave up for adoption was dx'ed with the exact same type of cancer/node involvement, etc back in June. I am now getting genetic testing and will rethink keeping the \"girls\" based on those results. It is such a personal decision, but they say that a lumpo w/rads is just as successful in treating BC if it is non-genetic. MOB - you are doing a great job keeping up with us all!

It's not fun, but if it is the worst SE I have this week then I am not complaining! Eliza - welcome, and sorry to hear that you are having a tough time. I am also on TAC X6 and have finished 3 rounds. Everyone is different, but I have to say that I have found that the 1st round was by far the worst, and each round has gotten \"better\" since then. I bounce back quicker and have less side effects (SE's). My worst days are 2-4 and by 5 I am back at work and almost normal. Are your treatments every other week or every 3 weeks? For everyone else - I hope this proves to be the same for you (each treament getting easier)!  I had options of either AC + T 4 each or doing the trial I am in which would have been either TAC or TC for 6. Lucky me, I got all 3. Actually now I am glad, because I'd rather get all at the same time and not have to deal with the different SE's at different times and for 8 treatments instead of 6. I was a little worried that getting Adriamycin for 6 treatments might be hard on the heart, but so far so good. I think all of us who had node positive get one of these regimens for at least 6 treatments. Node negative has other considerations like grade, oncotype, fam history, etc. ER/PR/Her2 status is also important for if and what kind of chemo you get. As for the furminator - I have 3 60 lb+ dogs and one 45 lb dog, all of whom shed like crazy. My chow/husky is the worst, and furminator works like a charm. They also make a shampoo that is WONDERFUL, I highly recommend it once a month.",

So far that is all that I have been doing, but have heard others put cream if it starts to get dry & flaky. I think the Nioxin or Mane & Tail shampoos start after your last chemo when regrowth can FINALLY start to occur. Don't waste your money on it now, as each chemo attacks the follicles all over again. Nadine- good vent. I do that to myself sometimes too, but really try to avoid it. Statistics are not always friendly! Go read the positive threads on here about survival stories, there are lots! Sometimes it is good to find a distraction that takes our brains completely away from cancer in general! For me I have had to find a hobby (remodeling my house) that takes my thoughts away from all of this. I think I may also learn a new hobby, like crocheting, that can occupy my time. Find something that works for you, or learn something you've always wanted to learn! This is a great time for that, as it is all about a time of renewal!!",

It is supposed to be a wonder drug for the bones and preventing bone mets. However, there is a small chance of getting a pretty awful SE  - jaw rot. Your lower jaw literally atrophies and disappears. I forget the clinical term. It is a very small % of patients who get this, and the benefits of the drug far outweigh the risk. I would advise going to the dentist for baseline check-up/x-ray prior to the start so you can monitor changes in the bone density in your lower jaw. Good luck with WBC kellerka! I also haven't noticed additional hair falling out since about mid 2nd treatment, but I hardly have any left (doing TAC). I do think some little white fluff has started to grow, so will see if that can hold on. I do notice it when the wind blows! Have a great treatment today all those getting the hook up!

I hope #4 goes as well, I hear that is when the Se's start to be cumulative and the fatigue really sets in. I won't believe that til it happens! MichelleinSJ glad to see you back! How is the top of your head doing? I had a mild breakout up there too, and took a wig vacation. It seemed to clear up in about 2-3 days and has been fine since. Pickle - I love your avatar pic with the hat & 1/2 wig! You look so cute. I got a 1/2 wig too, but it is too long and does a Carol Brady flip. That style looked terrible on the Brady Bunch, I don't really want it for myself! lol I accidentally went out to meet my landscaping guy Saturday morning completely bald and without a stitch of makeup! I forgot that I wasn't wearing anything on my head, and when he rang the doorbell..... out I walked! I realized about an hour later and was mortified! I thought he was looking at me funny, but didn't put it together. Oh well, we have to laugh at ourselves! Hot flashes- if you can believe it, it was 99 degrees here already last Thursday. I have been dying and getting hot flashes many times a day. They really stink! I don't know what I am going to do as we keep creeping up to summer weather. Anyone in a cold climate like to change places with me for awhile?!?!? :) Ok, I am talking too long here. Everyone have a great day, and best of luck to all of you having treatments today! <<<<Good vibes!>>>>",

You have been a little quiet, so hope you are out enjoying life and recovering from the party with 25(!) 6yo's. I have tx #3 Friday, and am starting to dread it now. Having my house project was a great distraction, but now that I am done I have too much time to worry about going in for #3. I just hope and pray the SE's are the same or better as the last 2, and then all will be fine by about day 6. I am registered for the Race for the Cure on Saturday, but will not be able to go as I have to get Neulasta at the same time, and doubt I would be up for a 5K the day after treatment!

I will cross that bridge when/if it happens, for now I just pray the results are negative, as my half sister has 4 daughters and that would be scary for her!  It was crazy finding out about her cancer, if the adoption agency had called just ONE MONTH prior my mom would have said no, no one in the family has had BC. But they called about 3 weeks after my dx and we were all stunned. It has been good as we are all communicating now and it is like the family grew! I agree with the shorter treatment regimen too, I did not want 8 treatments! 6 sounded better (though 4 sounds even better than that!)",

Now you can start getting readjusted to life post BC! I am also glad to hear that you are SE-free (mostly) from the Tamoxifen. That is just wonderful. Dayla- I am tending to follow your way of thinking with the Tamox. I had the CYP2D6 test to see if I metabolize it, and was annoyed to get the results 'Intermediate metabolizer'. I would have been happy with any of the 3 other options, as those are clearly defined. Intermediate is a huge gray area, where science just doesn't know for sure if you really convert the drug to it's active metabolite form. So now I don't know what to do. Like you, I think I will start it, and see how it goes. I also think I want to get moving on having children as I am not getting any younger! Still no sign of a period, 6 1/2 weeks out from last chemo. I'll talk with my onc on the 30th about what to do if I want to try to get pregnant, as I know Tamox is contraindicated. I also never took the pill, but I am 87% ER+. However, since my tumor was luminal B type, there is evidence that Tamox may be of no additional benefit. I just hate that all of this is not clear-cut! I do want to make sure that I do all I can to keep this monster from coming back, but I also don't want to put my body through unnessecary treatment.  Have a great day all, hope you are well!",

I spent most of the day in bed, a first for me in this chemo journey. I am finally feeling a bit more normal today (70% is a good number!) and am am back at work. I have developed a huge aversion to the smell of my laptop, so cannot log on on the weekends. I think it is from using it during previous treatments... now I just cannot stand the way it smells!  Glad to hear most of you are doing well, and sorry for those of you feeling down! Buddy - hope you are doing better!  Congrats to Chick, and those of you finishing up last treatment this week! I am so excited for you all! Can't wait for all of us to join you on the flipside!",

Congrats on finishing, and I hope your SE's are short and easy! This is the last time you will have to feel any of them! Congrats to you too Jan on the negative genetic testing! Woohoo, that is great news! I am glad to hear you made it through Taxol #1 Rachel. I hope that it treats you kindly, and you have minimal SE's! Fingers crossed! Raymon - I think it is up to the onc when you have your port out. Mine said all along that he wanted me to leave it in a year 'just in case'. Well, I was having none of that, and I think he knew it. I asked again at my last tx, and he relented and said I just had to wait 2-3 weeks. So I am getting it out Friday. Yippee. I can't wait to have it gone! I also worry about rad SE's, especially on my 'bad' arm. I hope we sail through it and keep LE at bay! Dayla - that cocktail had some really rare, expensive rum. And my neulasta shots were $7500, who was getting theirs so cheaply? Thank God for insurance. My chemos ran about $20K each and I had 6. Good luck to you on going back to work, I hope you slide right back into the groove! Malleme- I think there is a 50/50 chance you will get your period back. If you don't, most onc's wait one year and keep you on Tamox, then do a blood test to make sure you're in menopause and switch you over to an AI. I hope the Tamox treats you well, sorry to hear it caused problems for your sis. Whew, I was long-winded this morning! Can't blame steroids anymore, think I will blame it on Starbucks instead. Coffee is finally starting to taste somewhat decent again. Small things to be grateful for!",

Add me to the motivation list, I will need it once all of this is done! Dayla - I can totally relate to where you are mentally right now. I also have 4 of 6 TAC out of the way, and felt REALLY REALLY sorry for myself after #4. It took much longer to recover from it than it had from the 1st three, and seeing everyone else finishing up that just had 4 treatments really made me have a big ole pity party for one. I pouted, I contemplated quitting treatment, and I just couldn't see how I can go on. Luckily, about 11-12 days after treatment, the cloud lifted. Now I am ready for #5 this Thursday, and I will chant to myself the whole time \"only one more to go, only one more to go\". You will feel better soon, I promise! I also have hot flashes from hell, and it makes my head super sweaty. I do the layers thing, and have a sheet and light blanket on the bed, with a down throw nearby in case I get chilled. I spend all night throwning covers off and on. You do get more used to it as time passes. They don't get better, you just find yourself adjusting. However, I can no longer wear a wig, as it seems to make the hot flashes constant in the 95+ degree weather we are having.  Ricki - I hope you are doing better! I also live alone, and it can be frustrating sometimes to not be able to do things yourself. I am terrible about asking for help, so I have been just forcing myself to get things done. Do ask for help if needed though, this is a time where I know there are so many people who would be willing to help, and we are all here to listen anytime! Hope everyone is feeling good today, and had a great mother's day! Janine",

Nasharayne - Congrats on the reappearance of Aunt Flo! That gives me hope. Still no sign for me either, and I am coming to the end of my 2nd month on Tamox. SE's are not too bad, just hot flashes from Hades and mood swings. I notice every time I have a strong emotion, I get a hot flash. So this means 15-20 per day, less at night. Sigh. Everything else is going well. I love work, my job is the best and keeps me busy. I love family, and can't wait to spend time with them during the holidays. My niece is growing by leaps and bounds, and I love her to pieces, even though she is scared of me and screams every time she sees me. lol. I have my 3 month f/u at the onc tomorrow. Can you believe we have weeks/months now that go by without dr appts? I know that isn't true for everyone yet, but a large majority. I think I may have truncal LE, my breast and chest wall feel wrong and swollen, especially after flying. I'll confirm with my onc tomorrow. My hair is growning like molasses. Hardly at all. I did last chemo 6/4/09, and only have about an inch of hair. It is so sad. I have always had slow-growth, so am not surprised, but I wish it would grow faster. Lots of people say it suits me, but my hubby hates hates hates it. He's gonna have to get used to it, it's gonna be short for quite some time at this rate!

I hope the Abraxane works out for you, and I think the SE's are similar to the tax. The allergy is not to the actual drug, but to the chemical the drug is suspended in. Abraxane and Taxol are suspended in different reagents so do not cause the allergy. I have heard that about 10% have reactions on 1st infusion, but something like 30-50% react to the second one because the body builds antibodies to it after the initial infusion is done. I was terrified getting my 2nd one because I had the same sunburn effect malleme talked about, plus a nasty rash on both hands from the tax. I thought for sure I'd have an allergic reaction the second the drip hit, but I was relieved to see it did not happen. I still developed a rash on my hands this time, but it was much milder. Also onc said we can have foods with soy, as long as soy isn't one of the 1st 3 ingredients listed. Sugar is mainly banned because of cavities, but as long as you are maintaining oral care, this should not be much of a problem! I am not sure why the no caffeine, but in moderation I am sure it is fine! I felt well enough this weekend (1 week from TAC #2) to clean my entire house and purge a 3rd bedroom that I had turned into a storage room. It was piled high with junk, and now is completely empty! It felt great to be able to get so much done! I like how this diagnosis has finally spawned me to get things done! It is one good thing coming out of it all. Up next - getting the backyard redone and remodeling my 2 extra bedrooms! Woohoo! Have a great rest of the weekend all! ((hugs))",

I know you will get through it with flying colors, as you are super strong and positive! At least it is a quick infusion (15 minutes!) and you should tolerate it well. Rachel - sorry about your cold, that is such a bummer! But bully for you still going to the gym. I have been good about going as well, though I still have not been brave enough to go topless. I do have about 1/4 inch of mostly white hair now. Maybe in another month... My onc suggested I start a diet. I did so well not gaining weight through chemo, but ballooned after the last treatment. I think I was eating out of relief, and enjoying how things tasted. I put on about 15 pounds in the last 7 weeks. Some of it is probably water weight, as I too have been puffy around the legs/ankles. So I have to do Lasix for a few days to see if that helps. I asked him about the pregnancy issue - he agreed that I should wait at least 2 years. He saw me get a little teary, and ammended that we'll see how things go. Dayla - good luck with starting rads today! It has been fairly easy so far (I have done 19 of 34).",

Dayla - thanks for the bear video, that was hilarious! Karen - quite a few of us had TAC (or ACT) altogether - me, Dayla (Alyad), Dawn, Bethr. It just depends on how your onc decides to do it, and your pathology. Personally, I was in a research study where you could either get TAC or TC, and wound up with the TAC. It wasn't too bad, and I hope the results of the study help future generations of women going through this. I think most of us who got Adriamycin got the neulasta shot. It was good for helping with those WBC's, but caused me some bad back pain! Totally worth it though, as I never caught any illnesses throughout chemo, and I worked the whole time (in a lab, handling blood samples none-the-less!) Pickle - I love your posts, and never think of you as \"long-winded\"! You bring so much cheer to the board! I met with the rad onc Friday, and have simulation 7/1 and start 32-34 zaps 7/6. I get my port out 6/26 (still upset that I have to be admitted and have it done under general anesthesia, but I will be happy to get it out, so will stop whining. Soon.) Good luck to all today going through tx's of all kind (surgeries, rads, chemo)!!!!! Edited to add- Oh yeah, welcome back Francine, looks like you had a fantastic time! Those pics were gorgeous! Welcome back Raymon too! Hang in there! Congrats kim on almost being done! Woohoo! Ok, I think I am done now. Darn chemo brain!",

I did have to be put under & intubated, but was under for less than an hour, so nausea was very little. I think they busted my lip putting in the tube, that hurts more than the port now! Thanks nasharayne for reminding me about the paper I signed saying they would call if it was over $375! I did sign that, and no one called me, so I will definitely argue that if I get a bill. Otherwise my insurance has been awesome, I just paid $20 copay for each chemo. No copay for the neulasta. I agree that I don't know how people do it without insurance, this is big money! Friday I would have been having chemo, and it was so nice to not have to go in. I am about 3 1/2 weeks out, and the SE's have mostly disappeared! My hair growth has come to a halt though, which is a shame. I hope it will start up again soon, as I would like to be able to ditch the buffs in time for my cruise in September! Raymon, so sorry to hear about your Taxol SE's. I hope they get better soon! (((hugs))) Nadine - congrats on being almost done!!! Happy early b-day also, hope you are planning a big to-do!

I vomited for 14+ hours straight, got dehydrated, had to go in for 2 bags of fluids, a bag of steroids, and 2 more anti-nausea IV meds. My poor nurse.... she had an antiseptic smell and every time she came near me I puked. I felt bad for her, but worse for me!  I just have no idea how I am going to make myself go back for #6. I just can't even think about doing it all over again... it makes me queasy just considering it! I wonder if 5 treatments is just as effective.....??? I know it is \"just one more\" I just don't know if I can do it. Sigh.  Ladies, I so look forward to the days when all of this is a distant memory.

Robin - hope you are doing ok, fevers are scary if left untreated - I would take no chances! Let us know how you are when you can! CCbaby- I have noticed some pain and possible fungus on my 2 big toes also. I painted them dark so I wouldn't have to see them. How is that for denial?? :) I heard tea tree oil works wonders. Thanks Donna & MOB for the encouragement. Rachel - I had my doc switch me to Emend this time since everyone seemed to do well by it. I think the problem was that the idiot took away all the other anti-nausea meds that I would normally get in my IV! So apparently Emend by itself does not work for me. Next time I will get Emend, Aloxi and Ativan. If I go. I may just run away! Ok, no I'm kidding, but it is tempting to just NOT DO the last one. I'd be kicking myself down the road if I ever had recurrance/metastasis, so I won't tempt fate. If I were Stage I, low grade, or had no nodes, maybe I would talk my way out of it. Alas, that was not my case. Annette - congrats on finishing this part of the journey! I hope your neuropathy improves by leaps and bounds!  Good luck today Donna and everyone else having treatment!",

I really appreciate your story! Buddy/Raymon - I too am fluid-filled. I saw my onc for follow up on Thurs and had gained 13 lbs in 3 weeks!! All fluid build-up apparently. I have noticed that my legs and arms have been very \"puffy\" and getting indented very easily. I will follow your advice Raymon and load up on more fluids and cut the sodium. I had developed a bad salt habit with chemo, since that was about the only taste I still had working. I will cut that out now! Is anyone having the CYP2D6 test for metabolizing Tamoxifen? I asked my onc for it (he said I was the 1st pt ever to ask, and the lab struggled with the orders as they never send that one out). My tumor type is historically slow to respond to tamox, so I figure I would rather know beforehand if I will even get any benefit from it. I am not due to start for about 7 weeks, so hopefully the test results will be in by then.",

My 1/2 sister had 39 removed, and hers were small. We each had a few positive. I think it invades smaller faster, so you would likely have more infected than someone like me, who has large nodes. My sentinel node had over 2 cm of cancer cells! I think it fills each node, then moves on to the next. It takes a lot larger to fill cm than mm! As for rads - I really found my first few to be the scariest. It is uncomfortable and unknown. However, by the 3rd or 4th it gets pretty easy and becomes a routine. I had 3 zaps for the first 28, and 5 boosts at the end (Annette - boosts are much easier and faster!). I did get some burned skin by the last week, but Silvadene cream helped immensely. You'll do fine, and the meds will help a lot. Rachel - glad you are feeling calmer! I have been likened to Sinead as well. I can handle that. It is better than being liked to a military man (which is what my boss said!)",

I suggest meeting with a gyno before starting Tamox to get a baseline transvag ultrasound and then following up every few months to check for changes in uterine/endometrial lining. I do believe depression is a POSSIBLE Se of the Tamox, but it doesn't happen to everyone. Was your BC highly estrogen positive?  Patti - strange that your Ki67 score was not on your path report. Was there anything referring to 'proliferation' on the report? You can always ask your onc if you are curious. Have a great week all!",

Sounds like he was a gem, and made his time on earth wonderful for all who knew him. Big hugs! Hope you are having a great time on your Guatemala trip - it sounds exciting! Nadine - glad to hear that your MRI came out well. WLL - port removal was easy. I had gen anesthesia in hospital, but just a short day surgery. Very little discomfort, and so happy to have it GONE! Christy - sorry about your nephew as well, and very happy to hear that he is doing better. Dayla - could you have chigger bites? They are seriously itchy, and the itch and redness lasts 3-4 weeks. They are miniscule ticks that are very common in that area. They like to congregate in warm moist areas, like sock and underwear lines. Collodial oatmeal and calomine lotion are the most soothing treatments, and unfortunately nothing is a fast remedy, you just have to wait for the bumps to subside. Ok, I know I am forgetting to comment on half of what I read, and I am super sorry about that. I have to do better about staying caught up! Nice to see some of you who have been awol (Gina, Buddy, Arnie, WLL, Julie, etc). I loved your story Julie, and congrats on your impending wedding!  Hope all is well!",

Buddy - you had asked about turning red, that is pretty normal for chemo and the steroid. I look like an oompaloompa (sp?) after every tx for about 3 days, and my breast that had the lumpo gets really red & swollen too. Apparently chemo targets our healing wounds, as those are faster dividing cells, so you may notice more pain/swelling/redness in your surgical sites. As for the mouth soreness, next time try chewing on ice chips as you are getting the infusion, it helps with the general yuckiness and can preserve some tastebuds. I have much more taste after tx #2 than I did after #1! And alyad, you are completely correct about day 4, it is when the second-pass metabolism gets underway. First pass takes out the initial chemicals and causes them to transfer into active metabolites that do a whole other number on our bodies. The first few half-lives pass, then the liver kicks into it's second pass and causes us to feel really bad again, probably worse because now the steroids are gone. Then you really should start feeling better as everything starts to leave the system between 6-10 days post tx. kellerka - good luck with the shower! I have never participated in one, so I am afraid I have no ideas for you, other than to have good food and good drinks available! I hope someone can help!",

Good wishes to those still in treatment and getting surgeries! I see some of you from time to time on facebook, and it always makes me smile! I am (ironically, or maybe destiny?) going to be in NY on those exact dates with my male BFF. We have a ton of things planned, but I would love to sneak away and meet up with all of you at some point during the trip! How great it will be to meet some of you wonderful ladies!  Health-wise I have been ok. I graduated to seeing my onc every 3 months now, despite having abnormalities in my last mammo. I will have another mammo/US in June and we will see how that looks. Tamox SE's have been tolerable, but I am relieved to hear that others have been eating and snacking like crazy. I wondered why I had been doing that! Now I can blame the meds, lol. I am getting it under control. And I have been training for the Rock n Roll 1/2 marathon in New Orleans, which is this coming Sunday (aaack!). I am running/walking it, and won't be very fast, but will definitely finish! Great to see all of you and hope that NY works out! Janine",

They did lots of tests, and it turns out that he has acute plasma cell leukemia with multiple myeloma. They are giving him only 3 weeks - a few months to live. It has been a very tough week, and I think it will get only worse. He started chemo today (Velcade), and if he does well, they will give him Cytoxin on Wed, Velcade again Friday. Then if he does ok with that, they are looking at another 4 drugs in a constant 4-day infusion.  I had to cancel my trip to NY, which is making me sad as well. I was really looking forward to it, and to meeting all of you, but I really need to help my mom and dad out at the hospital, and I would never forgive myself if he passed away while I was gone. This was the 1st time I used Priceline's \"Name your own price\" feature, and I got 3 nights at the Warwick for $175/night. Of course that means no cancellation or refund... but I called and explained, and they said they would make an exception if they get medical documentation. So please, if you have time, pray for my father to have strength and peace. His name is Richard DeKing, and the more people I can have praying for him, the better. Sorry to have to cancel. I hope we can plan on something again in the future. Janine",

She recommended that I have an ooph, or complete hysterectomy as soon as I can come to terms with it. I was greatly saddened by the whole thing. DH is very upset too, and this may be enough to lead to a divorce for us. He had the nerve to say that hysterectomies make women \"crazy monsters\" which I totally disagree with. But I know he really wants to have children, preferably several. So I started taking the dreaded T on Friday, and sleepless nights have already returned. That is my biggest problem - sleep. Plus joint pain, weight gain, mood swings, and just general BLAH feeling. Christy - congrats on being postmenopausal. Will you go on a different med now, like Arimidex? I thought my menstrual cycle came back, but apparently it was a 'pseudo-cycle' and has disappeared again. *Sigh* It's hard to believe that summer is here again. Time flies so fast these days! I hope all of you get in some great R&R and vacations this summer.",

I just finished a crazy week of babysitting my 1-yr old niece while my brother and his wife jetted off to the Bahamas. It was great fun, but exhausting. This is the most time I have ever spent with a child, so it was a good learning experience.  Ricki - so good to \"see\" you here again! Congrats on the wonderful news about your sister. She is a miracle. Looking forward to seeing your new pics! I need to update mine some time too. Rachel - good to hear things are still going well with you and jelly bean. I bet your mom is going to be thrilled (and maybe a bit scared for you). I hope the visit with her went well. I had good news - my endometrial biopsy was negative, and my mammo and ultrasound show that all of the areas they have been monitoring are completely stable. Woohoo, after my next one in December, I am cleared to just having annual mammo's!!! Yippee.  I love the idea of a virtual exercise group. I have been doing well lately and trying to stay motivated. I signed up for a half marathon in November, and plan to jog the whole thing this time. I have been walking/running 4-5 miles 3-4 times a week in order to get ready. I will add longer sessions towards the end of summer. It is getting really hot and humid here, which will probably mean I have to move my exercise to the gym, which is a bit of a bummer. I'd like to run in the mornings, but I come to work at 6am, which means I would have to go run at 4am, and I think that is just way too early! Bethr - I bet the gurgling is related to your LE, but definitely point it out to your surgeon. It does sound pretty funny. And I can totally visualize Francine doing an Ahnold impression on Letterman, lol. Hope everyone is doing well!",

I am still getting mammo's every 6 months, as they are watching an \"area of interest\". I see my onc on the 26th and will look at the official report then. It seems like almost 2 years of watching this area might be enough... we may need to biopsy. Otherwise, everything is going well, and life is as busy as ever.

I think it is even better than your long hair and makes you look even younger! Nice to know you can rock short hair when it starts growing back! ann-idiot my onc also disregards oncotype dx if you are premeno, under 45, or have any node involvement. I was getting chemo before I was even staged JUST because of my age. I need it anyway, but I would have maybe argued it if my results had been different (say under 1 cm). Speaking of arguing things with my onc (I am SUCH a difficult pt, lol) I talked my way out of my Neulasta shot after tx #2 and convinced him to wait a week. Well, Friday I went for labs feeling really good and energetic. My WBC had dropped from 23,000 to 1000 in that week. And somehow, despite eating all kinds of crap, I lost 6 pounds and my BP was about 99/70. Oops. So I won myself a shot. And I had not taken premeds cuz I felt so darn good I didn't think for a second my WBC would be anything but fantastic. Then, if you read my earlier post, I worked my butt off all weekend on projects around my house including lifting and carrying heavy boxes/furniture, etc. Last night my lower back and hips felt like fire!!! Flaming pain, right across the midsection. I took Claritin and Advil and slept ok, but this morning again, fire! I guess my bone marrow is hard at work, but oh, all that is holy it hurts! And I have to stand at work for a large portion of the day. So lesson learned: get the shot after chemo and take the darn claritin!! Sigh. I always have to try and talk my way out of things. I am newly humbled. Good luck to all getting cocktails today! Francine and knowledge, good luck on #2!!! I have the Feel good, look better class finally today, hope I get free goodies!",

I am going to give it another day or 2 and then call my onc. Next week I am heading to the Bahamas. My brother is taking me along as \"nanny\" to their daughter - my 15 month old niece. I am getting an all-expense paid trip, staying at my own suite at Atlantis, and flying 1st class. Boy, better believe I jumped on that opportunity!!!

I am really dreading this. I can't take oral iron because I have been having a lot of trouble going to the bathroom since December. My colonoscopy was clear, but ob/gyn thinks my fibroids have now grown large enough to cause blockage/pressure in my bladder and rectum. So I am having a myomectomy 4/5/11. Apparently fibroids really have a party with Tamoxifen - it actually increases estrogen-effects in uterine/ovarian tissue. Whoopie.  Anyone else having issues?",

I really look like a demented chicken till I put on a buff, then I look like a pirate. I have been wearing hoop earrings to accentuate this look. So far it is still funny to me, though I am sure one of these days I will have a pity party for myself. My hair is fine, so I haven't worried about the loose ones coming off, though I had heard the lint roller is invaluable. laurie - I hear you about head choices... I do really recommend the buffs from www.PlanetBuff.com as they are comfortable and easy. They have \"polar buffs\" if you live in a cooler climate, but for me the Texas summer means as light and cool as possible! You can get similar ones cheaper at Amazon by searching \"buff headwear\" and I believe the company is called HeadCase, but the quality is not as good. Cyndi - I am so sorry you are still not feeling great and dealing with mouth sores! I hear you about the sleeping thing too. I slept from 11p - 3am last night and was then wide awake.

It is a huge shock to see the new, hairless you. I promise it does get easier though. I thought I would cry all the way through getting it chopped, but I was actually ok (surprised myself!).

I had a lumpectomy, SNB, and mediport placement done 1/13/09, and was actually able to go back to work 2 days later. The port was actually the most bothersome part of the whole thing, and maybe the nausea/vomiting from the general anesthesia.  I have worked every day since (I'm a chemist, and have to use my arms quite a bit which caused a little pain and swelling, but not too bad). Unfortunately I got my results on the 19th, 2/3 nodes involved and no clear margins, so I am heading back for surgery #2 tomorrow. I have the axillary dissection w/drainage tube, and revision of the lumpectomy. How bad is that drainage tube? I am hoping to return to work on Monday if at all possible!   You guys are all fantastic and brave, and I am so happy to read your stories! What encouragement!!",

Then they got lighter and more sporadic, especially with Tamoxifen. I did end up having 12 uterine fibroids, and had them removed in April, and now my periods are all over the place, but not as heavy a flow. Be sure to get your iron levels checked (iron, ferritin, TIBC, % saturation) as these heavy flows can lead to iron deficiency and anemia.

What I think is scary is trying to apply the numerous statistics to your particular case. For example, I had \"#\" positive nodes, \"___\" Ki67, grade \"#\", so according to the nomograms, I should live about 8.3 more years. I got really bogged down in those number games, and it really scared me for some time.

Statistics say that it most likely will be nothing, a fibroadenoma. Mine had no pain, it was just there, like a frozen pea under my skin. All the docs wanted to call it nothing, but lucklily my breast surgeon decided to go ahead and biopsy just to be sure.  Let us know how it all turns out, and my thoughts will be with you, as this waiting period is the hardest part!!!!

I was dx'ed at 33, and the onc and breast surg said from the beginning that chemo was a GIVEN because of my age, no matter what the path report said. Once I had surgery and they found node involvement, I really had no choice in the matter. You have to go with your gut, but I would say throw everything you have at this disease. Chemo is not fun, but it is very doable, and it goes by quickly. I had 6 cycles of TAC. I also agree that you should have a 2nd opinion about the regimen, as TC is thought to be just as effective, and so much easier on the body. There is also CMF, which is an easier chemo for lower grade, less aggressive forms. Very little hair loss with that one! Good luck to you, we'll all be sending good thoughts your way! Janine",

I think he started ordering them about one - 3 months after rads were done. My understanding is that it is useful only when looking for recurrance or spread, and probably not of any value when you are first dx'ed.  They'll look at them as a trend - consistently rising, staying the same, or falling.",
