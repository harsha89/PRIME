Don\u2019t know if radiation caused it. I too have osteopenia too. That is why this drug scares me. It seems like it is going to make everything I already have worse. I\u2019m new to this site. What does MO mean? What doctor is that? I see it mentioned a lot. I don\u2019t know what to do. Tired of thinking about it tired of worrying about it. Happy you do not have to take it anymore.",

Since completing the radiation I have been getting hot flashes. Has anyone else experienced this? I have not yet started taking the arimidex which has a side effect of hot flashes.
