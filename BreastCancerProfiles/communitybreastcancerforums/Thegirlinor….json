My dad's pretty closed off about such things and my friends...well, understandably it's hard for them, so I don't talk about it much with them.  I did tell him about my mother (although not in detail) because it felt important to do so, she is/was a big part of my life and it was a big event.    I'll go and check out those threads/forums, thankyou! x ",
