Did radiation and then started Arimidex (Anastrozole).  Two weeks later I started waking with hand pain, numbness.  Now occurs during the day as well.  It's a stinging pain, not easily ignored. My fingers are warm but swollen, arm is not swollen.   Can't feel the keyboard.  It comes and goes and I'm trying to log so I can pin down the variables.",
