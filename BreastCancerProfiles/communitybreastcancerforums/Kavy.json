Stephanie, even though you do not know me, you have been in my daily prayers for a while now. I pray that in two weeks you will be having your chemo, and that you will have a great response to the chemo combo and the mets will be gone or under control. Shen, I am adding you to my daily prayers too. I pray that your doctor will find a way to keep your liver mets under control. Are you both taking Milk Thistle supplement? I read it is very good for the liver. Both of you, hang in there.  God is able. A big hug, KarlaV.",

      "Content": "Sep 26, 2008 03:52AM - edited Sep 26, 2008 03:57AM by Kavy Mason, I am very sorry you are going through all this. I think the surgery right now is not as important as you going back to chemo ASAP. It is great that you are going to start Herceptin soon,  but since you are Hers2+, you should have started Herceptin a long time ago. I am also Hers2+, and I am on Herceptin for 3 years now. Since your cancer has spread to different parts of the body, I think it is better to add chemo to Herceptin to get these mets under control asap.  Taxotere is a very good chemo, it worked very well for me, and I had very few side effects (low white blood counts and hair loss). Since you said that Taxotere was so bad for you, Abraxane is also a taxane, it is from the same family as Taxotere, but you do not need to take pre- medications. I am not sure if the side effects would be mild with this new drug, you should ask your doctor. There is another chemo that it is very good too, and it worked for me for 18 months for my lung mets, it is called Nalvabine. The side effects are mild and no hair loss, only thinning of the hair, and no pre-medication, but it is hard on the veins, so you might need a port or a pick line (sp?) I have a port. I also had Gemzar for 9 months,  it is also a good drug, no pre-medications, but my hair got thinner, and my red counts were low sometimes. Now I am on Xeloda for almost 3 months, and I am doing fine. No pre-medication either. It is a pill form of chemotherapy. Very mild side effects for me, my hair is gettting fuller by the day, but I have mild hand and foot syndrome. I will have a scan on October to see how things are going. Also, ask your doctor about Zometa, it is for bone mets, I think it is to make the bones stronger. As you can see, I have been fighting breast mets to the lungs for almost 3 years ( in November), before I had also liver mets, but they are gone now. If I can do it, you can do it too. Hang in there,  take one day at a time, and get ready for the fight. Sending  prayers for you and your doctor to make the right decison for your treatment. If you have any questions, PM me, and I will be happy to help you. A big hug, KarlaV.",

In April 2005 I was diagnosed with STage 3C, no mets, and hoping to be cured. I had chemo, mastectomy, radiation, and would have more chemo. Then I got the news of the spread. I was in the same place where you are now, and you need to hang in there, that things will get better. I have had Epirubicin+Cytoxan+Taxotere. After surgery and radiation, I had Taxotere/Herceptin for 6 months, then Nalvabine/Herceptin for 1 1/2 years, and the several liver tumors disappeared, and the lungs tumors also disappeared, except for a small one in the left lung. But then  the one lung met started growing again, so I was changed to Gemzar/Herceptin, and so far the side effects are minimum. I am er/pr negative and Hers2 positive. I am sorry you need the oxygen 24/7, but once you start treatment, you will feel much better. It is very scary to be diagnosed with mets. But with time you will get used to this too, and you will learn to live one day at a time. I was a planner too, that was part of my life. I still plan some now, but for a shorter period of time. Doing this, I got my life back, and I have been living pretty good with mets. In Novemnber it will be 2 years with lungs and liver mets diagnosis. One think I suggest you do is to think positive, I mean, think that the treatment will work, and see yourself breathing well and without the oxygen. Push the negative thoughts away from you. I suggest you reading the book The Secret, by Rhonda Byrne. This book has helped me a lot to deal with this diagnosed, it talks exactly about positive thinking. If I were you, I would make also an appointment for a second opinion a few days after you see your new oncologist. This way you will be sure that the treatment chosen by your new oncologist is the right for you. PM me if you need anything. I know how scared you are. Hang in there. You are in my prayers.
