I then met with a surgeon and onc on 10/31/2014. The treatment plan is chemo every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, then possible surgery and radiation and then hormonal. I had my CAT scan and MRI last week and my port put in on Monday. I started my chemo yesterday. I am still in that unknown period of how I am going to handle the chemo side effects. I am hoping to return to work in the morning after the Nulesta but we shall see. I also would like to work thru the chemo. Hang in a there we will get thru this together.",
