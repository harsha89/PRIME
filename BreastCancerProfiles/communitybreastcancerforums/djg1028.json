I don't know what to think.  When I saw him yesterday, I was fully prepared for him to say he would biopsy the areas.  Unfortunately, he said that you can't biopsy what you can't see.  Surgery never entered my mind.  I have two questions.  What type of cancer doesn't appear on imaging?  Secondly, during the surgical biopsy, if it's cancer, do they go ahead and do a mastectomy? I so want to be an ostrich and stick my head in the sand.  Thank you  ",

I would much prefer having a needle biopsy versus a surgical biopsy, but the dr said he does a guided needle biopsy with ultrasound, but since the lumps don't show up on ultrasound (or any of the other tests), he'd be going in blind and could miss it altogether.  My options are pretty much wait and see if they change, or have surgery and get it over with.  I don't want to be hasty, but as I'm sure you're all aware, having this hanging over my head is making me nuts!!!",

Met with another surgeon today for second opinion.  He didn't seem concerned and said he wouldn't do the surgical biopsy right now. Wants to see me in three months. I don't know which way to turn.  Don't want surgery, but don't want to take a risk with my life.  Any suggestions?",
