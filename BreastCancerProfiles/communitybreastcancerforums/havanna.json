I held on the last bit of hope but after early testing many years ago knew this time it was different. I know the tears will end or at least dry up some days. I know I need help from other folk that are in our shoes but this is my first step to do so. I find it all just a whirl wind of information and after been a carer 20 years ago for my mum with breast cancer nothing has prepared or come even close to how it really feels to have it. They say I have stage 1 or maybe two, maybe cemo may be not, may be lose your hair may be not maybe your lymphs will be negative maybe not, maybe this op maybe that one you choose...You may go into early menopause or the tablets will make you think so......now now think posative...can they not see my silent blank eyes are screaming go away ? To top it all Iam allergic to dressing and after my lymph node removal its just the straw that broke the camels back. I look on here day after day yet don't know what help I want but deep down know I want it. Havanna aka survivor x Log in to post a reply",
