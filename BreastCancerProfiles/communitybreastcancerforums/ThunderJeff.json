After her xeloda + keytruda clinical trial failed her in January, she had 10 cycles of rads to spine followed by four cycles of gemcarbo (and she just started the fifth). Scans after fourth cycle showed things holding steady and maybe some lesion shrinkage, which brings us to now. She's down around 50 pounds since dx in October. It's actually shocking. So weight is an issue. Depression is another and I've been hounding her team to treat that as a high priority item (she's on buproprion, but I think they should give an SSRI a whirl). That said, docs want to stay the course for now. So a few questions for the group: any thoughts on the best foods to keep the pounds on? Her frailty cannot be helping the recovery effort. Have any of you taken \"breaks\" in a chemo that is showing some efficacy to let your body recover a bit? Her docs floated the possible of switching over to an endocrine therapy after a few more cycles. Is there anything particularly promising in the pipeline? Last year verzenio was a nice launch, just curious what this very savvy group thinks about any next-gen therapies. Thoughts and prayers to you all, Jeff Log in to post a reply",

My mom does not live alone--my dad is with her, but he's still working quite a bit. They have in-home help when he's away. Nest is essentially empty, although my brother just came home after graduating from college, so that should help. The thing is, unlike a lot ofyou St. IV ladies that can \"live life,\" my mom's first five-ish months post diagnosis kept her essentially bedridden (she actually did develop a couple bed sores) because of a very, very painful vertebral fracture she sustained at C6 due to a lesion + intense yoga (she's an instructor). That led to a rather trainspotty pain management regimen that at its peak had her on 100 mcg fentanyl a day, plus chemo, plus nerve pain blockers, etc. The fentanyl dose has since been halved, and shes back to walking around again, and more and more each week--but a lot of damage done to get to this point: she's lost 40+ pounds and her poor legs atrophied. In hindsight, surgery on the spine at the outset would have been the right call, but her medical team, including a neurologist recommending surgery, opted for the clinical trial (that failed). I think my dad is doing a lot, but I've noticed that lately there seems to be a distance there. I've heard this is not uncommon in caretakers out of self-preservation--her needs have been extensive, but I worry about her because her universe is so small at the moment.",

I must say--mother's day was a bit rough. My wife and I are expecting and told my mom on Sunday as a surprise--and although she's excited you could see the fear in her eyes that she is convinced she wont be able to be the grandmother she so longs to be and for as long as she wants to be. It was a swift kick in the gut and a reminder of how this horrible, horrible disease can take that life you thought you'd have. I've battled bouts of depression my entire adult life, so when she was dx'd with liver, lung, and bone involvement in 10/2017 I immediately got on an antidepressant so I could be there for my family at my best. I feel like Sunday undid so much of the \"handle\" I thought I had on things, better living through medicine, etc., and I dont know what to do. If I could take her pain away I would in a heartbeat. I keep telling her that we live in extraordinary times from a medicinal advances standpoint (was oncology counsel at a large pharma company until recently), and I truly believe that we are on the precipice of great advances in solid tumors. I just hope they happen in time for her and all of the women on this board. Bleh--so much word vomit. First thing is first--get that woman a cake.  Hugs, prayers, and positive vibes to all Jeff",

I'm glad you're feeling better and enjoying life. I think a break is probably inevitable on our end, as the last two cycles (4 and 5) of my mom's gemcarbo cycle: week 1 (gemzar) week 2 (gemcarbo) week 3 off, and repeat, have been brutal. Her latest scans were actually pretty encouraging: pulmonary mets are all steady or have shrank, all lymph node mets shrank, at least one liver met shrank (and another was noted as possibly necrotic and low density despite area increase, which to me suggested the lesion is now a mass of dead cancer cells). Only concerning finding was an adrenal gland lesion--which I understand to be a rarity for BC mets. So the treatment appears to be efficacious ... but there is not quality of life after the gemcarbo infusion at week two. By the time she's recovering her strength the cycle starts over.",

I forgot to add that she is on a steady zofran regimen as well, although your point about taking the meds with bland meals is well taken and something that isn't currently happening to my knowledge. I had a long conversation with the pain doc that is part of the larger oncology team a couple of days back, and they may be adding something else to the mix to combat the nausea. I feel she went up on her dosages way too quickly. It went from norco to morphine to fentanyl in less than a month, and the fentanyl doses kept climbing almost arbitrarily. I would describe her as having near hallucinations on the 100 mcg patch in addition to this horrible nausea; scary stuff. Honestly, I think this community has better collective knowledge sometimes than the docs, so I greatly appreciate the insights. It's just devastating to see the frustration in her eyes. No matter how long or short this journey is for her (and I pray it is a long one), she doesn't deserve to waste away like this.",

Her pain doc mentioned this could be a possibility, and that drug-induced vestibular episodes can result. Has anyone else had trouble pinning down their nausea source?

She improved significantly since being admitted, which in my view confirmed my \"too many meds including opioid meds is causing nausea\" theory. It was a bit of revolving door on her second to last day. Palliative team visited and two different members of radiation oncology group came in--a resident and his attending. These visits startled my mom a bit. There was a focus on an unknown \"signal\" shown in the meninges of the brain scan and talk of brain radiation from the radiation oncologists (which is the first we had heard of that, as the head oncologist and his PA had previously told us that said \"signal\"/changes in the right meninges were most likely due to her previously dx'd mets to the right side of her skull). A member of the palliative team mentioned leptomeningeal carcinoma has not been ruled out. Radiation attending mentioned a \"60 percent chance\" the signal is mets to the CNS. But, after examining my mom, he seemed shocked that her pain meds were at such high dosages and thinks someone may have jumped the gun on ordering the brain scan, as she has no other neurological symptoms. So no brain radiation. Palliative team tweaked her nausea regimen which has helped. So now the plan is to finish her spinal radiation (only three sessions left!) followed by starting gemcarbo, and, for good measure, a brain scan in a month to rule out LM. A spine scan and spinal tap were discussed, but radiation onc attending didn't feel they would give positive results (which makes me think his 60 percent prediction = he has have no idea. As an aside, I checked out his bio, and I think there may be some confirmation bias at play, as his research specializes in brain rads and case studies/clinical trials involving the same). I went back and looked at her radiology report on the meninges, and it's about as CYA as possible: \"there is a possibility that the signal could be indicative of metastatic disease ... or [insert twenty other non-cancerous reasons].\" Holy hedging Batman. I'm glad she's feeling better, but the level of punting and the disconnect between the head oncologist and the radiation guys was palpable. We are frustrated to say the least, and praying the CNS is not involved in any way. Hugs to all, ThunderJeff ",
