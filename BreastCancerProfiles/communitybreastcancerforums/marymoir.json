I called my onc's office, and his RN called back and told me to go to the ER immediately to rule out a blood clot.

I has done lupron and tamoxifen for 6 mos when I had to stop due to anxiety,depression and massive panic attacks (which I've never had prior to lupron). Onc said it was only giving me a few percentage points in terms of survival, so I stopped about a year ago. Well, just found out I have mets to liver and bones, so now this issue is back on the table. Did a liver biopsy to make sure the mets have the same hormonal stats as my original tumor (apparently the mets sometimes change ER/PR status...who woulda thunk?). My naturopathic MD just did a bunch of tests to try to determine my hormone status, and onc is running some of his own tests to see if they can definitively determine if I'm finally truly menopausal. If they still can't say for sure that I'm \"there,\" onc says he wants me to go back on Lupron so I can take an AI. When I asked why not an ooph, he pointed out that I had a bad psych reaction to estrogen deprivation with lupron, and thought it might be worse after an ooph (which, unlike lupron, couldn't be \"undone\" once those little suckers are gone). Of course, now that I'm Stage IV, it doesn't seem to make much difference-- I'd rather take meds for panic attacks if it increases my time here on the planet!). After reading on this thread that the PDR for Lupron says it's contraindicated in folks with a history of breast cancer, my onc is gonna have some 'splainin to do to convince me that I shouldn't go the ooph route!",

I'm sorry my experience alarmed u...as a former \"Stage 1-er,\" I know my story is the worst nightmare of Stage1 gals (which is why I debated whether to respond to Alilou's post). To answer your ?, the mets were really diagnosed almost by accident. I started having extreme pain on my right lower ribcage area after I did some pretty extreme mountain biking. Pain was exacerbated by laughing, coughing, bending over. Onc's office said to call if it didn't get better. Had a sudden increase in pain while out of town a few days later...onc told me to get to an ER to rule out a blood clot in the lung. They did a chest CT at the ER which showed no blood clot, but did show mets to liver and bones (including the left shoulder...which I'd been complaining to an orthopedic surgeon about for months, and which had not shown up on an MRI of the shoulder just 4 months earlier). The shoulder lesion also showed up on a subsequent bone scan...don't know why the earlier MRI missed it. Anyway, there's my long sad-sack story. Try not to let it freak u out...as I said to Alilou, at Stage1 the odds are overwhelmingly on your side tht you'll bea this beast! Unfortunately, cancer is a crapshoot, and I just happened to be one of the unlucky few who happen to fall on the \"bad\" side of those #s!

I debated before responding cuz I didnt want to scare you, but i had right-side shoulder pain that was dismissed for too long by an orthopedic surgeon and my breast surgeon. Nothing showed up on regular X-rays, so they just said oh well (despite my history of BC). It's a long story (you can PM me if you want to know more), but it turned out to be mets to shoulder blade and/or referred pain from liver mets - they werent sure which cuz i do have a met in that scapula, but i also have liver mets that can cause referred pain to the right shoulder, neck, and arm). Even though it's VERY unlikely in your case, with a history of BC I would insist (politely, of course!!) that your doc investigate this further. Do you have a medical oncologist or just a surgical one? If you have a med onc I'd try there first as mine has been much more proactive than my surgical onc in invesetigating things like this. As I said, In your case it's more than not that your doc is right that it's left over from surgery and radiation as that I understand that is VERY common post-mastectomy. But, even if that's the case, your doc shouldnt just dismiss it. Although i had a lumpectormy & rads, not a mastectormy, I also had post surgery pain/tightness/tingling in the scapula, shoulder, and arm on my \"bad boobie\" side (left in my case). my med onc sent me to a physical therapist who specializes in breasts cancer patients who really helped with my pain and range of motion. She was a miracle worker!!! She said it was good that I came when I did because I was on the road to developing a frozen shoulder, which is REALLY hard to treat once it gets to that point. Good luck to you! And don't let your doctors dismiss your concerns! Take care!",

I never was sure if it was the alkaline diet per se as the fact that it cuts out refined sugar, processed food, soda, and coffee. I wasn't anal about sticking to the diet, but I'd say I adhered to it 95% of the time...funny thing is when I did eat pizza or go to Starbucks I felt noticeably crappy afterwards (which made me think I may have some kind of sub-clinical gluten and/or dairy intolerance).",

Re: the anemia -- my onc. nurse told me that adding extra iron to my diet won't help, b/c the chemo-induced type of anemia isn't iron-deficiency anemia (meaning you have enough RBCs, but they just need more iron), but rather a problem of the marrow not reproducing RBCs fast enough after getting slammed w/ the chemo.  Makes sense, but seems it couldn't hurt to try the diet route.  Have any of you who've tried adding iron to your diets found it to be helpful?  Prayers up for everyone here, whether you're gutting out one of the \"bad\" weeks, or enjoying one of the \"good\" weeks!",

He said he will re-evaluate how they are doing after 3 monthsnof Xgeva, but sadly it doesn't look like it's in the cards for this year b/c even if i get the \"green light,\" all the snow will be gone from our area by then. ...Sigh....maybe we can go out west for some spring skiing!!!",

Had some dull aching for a day or so afterwards, controlled with Advil. Hope it goes well and they find it's benign, but if not, there are lots of threads on here talking about all the new treatments for liver mets. Thoughts and prayers are with u!",

So sorry you've had to come here...I'm only 2 months out from my mets dx, so I can relate to the feeling of having been hit by an emotional Mack truck! Are u still in the middle of that whirlwind test phase? I found that to be the hardest part...fear of the unknown and all. Once all the staging tests were done and we had a treatment plan in place, I personally felt much better, but I'm the type that always feels better with \"a Plan.\". Hopefully you will start to feel a little less weak-kneed with fear once you start treatment and know that you're doing everything that can be done to knock those mets back. I know there are many women on these boards whose mets have been stable for many, many years. That being said, I think you will find these boards to be a tremendous source of support, information, and encouragement. I know they have been for me. Thoughts and prayers are with u as u get your feet back under you!",

      "Content": "marymoir wrote: Hi Ladies. Just found out today that I have progression in my liver (boo, hiss). My bone mets are stable,, which prompted my onc to opine that maybe the liver tumors have switched from ER+ to ER- (which would explain why Faslodex is not working on the liver but is still keeping the bones stable). He kept saying something about \"clones,\" don't know if he's just going all sci-if on me or if that is another way to describe my inconsistent results. Anyone else had this happen? He said that the new liver spots are easily biopsiable, but said that he's not sure we need to worry about the ER status at this moment because he is recommending I go back on chemo (Xeloda) because he's fearful that if we dick around with antihormals and the liver gets worse, I may be too sick to try some of the other chemos he has available at his cocktail bar. He still offered to do the biopsy now if I want to...at this point I think he wants to wait until if/when the liver gets stable again and we are considering anti-hormonals again before tHe biopsy would be relevant. I guess the only reason I'd want to know if for planning purposes....I.e., if I'm triple neg, I know that means several options are off the table that we thought were options before. I guess part of me wants to know exactly how bad things are. Anyone else been in this sit? Did your doc recommend the biopsy to confirm the switch in ER receptors?
