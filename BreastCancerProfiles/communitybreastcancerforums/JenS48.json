I'm 48 1/2 years old with stage 1A ER and PR positive, HER2 negative ductal carcinoma. I chose to be aggressive and have both breasts removed due to having very dense breast tissue which did not reveal my tumor on mammogram alone. I'm very happy with that decision as my collateral breast analysis post surgery revealed precancerous cells (whew!). I've been advised to have hormone suppressant therapy for at least five years once I begin. Today marks three weeks since my surgery.  Two days ago my Oncotype DX score came back at 19. I've done a tremendous amount of reading to try to be as informed as I can be prior to meeting with an oncologist about my treatment options. My surgeon, who is wonderful, said if my Oncotype came back above 16, I should have chemotherapy as well as the hormone suppression. In looking at the risks associated with chemo, I'm not sure where I stand. I'd love to know more from women who had similar circumstances. I promised my children and husband I'd be aggressive in treating this beast, but I don't want to be foolish about increasing other health risks for what I've been told is a 1-2% decrease in recurrance risk.  Thanks for your thoughts! JenS48",
