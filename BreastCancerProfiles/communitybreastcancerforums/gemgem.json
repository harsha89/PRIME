It is not sore it is close to my hair line. it is very hard and doesnt appear to be a particular shape. It is close to the surface of skin.  I visited my gp on tuesday she instantly felt it. Inspected my underarm and breast. She has given me dome fluxacillin 500mg and request that I go back in ten days which will be ten days time from when I went.  I am assuming that this is a normal routine for a gp to follow.  My main consern it that this lump I have found is not particularly very big It does feel like a pea just under the surface of my skin. About two months ago I had a lot of pain deep in my breast, not like a ache it was a sharpe persistent pain wish made me want to cradle myself. I visited the gp then, again no lumps or bumps I was given ibroprophen to ease the pain, the painwas not eased with anything. However the pain went about a week later...very happy me. But now a lump has apappeared under my arm and as every other woman can imagine I am thinking the worse and panicking like never before.  I am cconcerned that if in my next visit to my gp she disregards this lunp as a cyst or an infection of some sort. I am 29 years old and to be honest not quiet in the best shape of health over weight by miles and regretful to say a smoker...from today this will change.  My little lump moves up and down but it does not move so easily when trying to manipulate this left to right ( I hope this makes sence) its very hard and easy to find. No redness no pain no swelling its just there. I have been very over tired later but like everything I have been putting this down to my waist line until now I am very concerned.  What should I do or say if my gp will not refer me for any tests. My cousin at the age of 28 had testicular cancer and he was not refered for some time. However he is fighting fit now and has his check ups from time to time. I know any type of cancer at my age is unlikely but not impossible and other isuess wich are self inflicted like smokeing and over weight contributes to many problems. This is more than likely a cyst or an infected hair follicle but I dont want to be disregarded for any risks that are possible.  Advise, experiences anyone....thank you for reading :-)  Xx Log in to post a reply",

Am I within my right to ask for a referal or more to the point demand one if my gp does not refer me and there is no change to my lump. I am from the uk so it is upto the nhs to decide if this is suitable for a referal. I would be there today having all the tests in the world done if down to me. I think personaly that she wil suggest to wait and see... this is so scary to think that women like myself younger or older that a decision of this sort is out of your own hands. Sorry I am rattling on a little..I am very worried but im a believer that no one should have the right to decline someone of peice of mind. Please let me know if you can ask for a referal sometimes gps look at you like you are wasting their time and nhs funding and as I read on one sight clogging up the system for urgent cases. We have a 14 day referal rule here and its worrying to think by the time I have waited myself a week before going to see if it changes then ten more days before returing to the gp then a further 14 days time before an appointment. I feel this is along enough time to wait and I dont want to be brushed aside and forced to wait longer because of a system thatdoes not fully recognised breast cancer in younger women. Or am I being very much over the top in this reaction and just trust my gp. Thanks for your time and help I really appreciate your opinion and advise x",

When you where at the health clinic about to have what seemed to be a cyst drained had it felt different to the other cysts you had had or did it feel exactly the same? I only ask this as for future referance for myslef. I am sure my lump will be nothing to worry about. I will just feel more at ease once I know for sure. And thank you both so much. Sometimes it only takes a hand full of people to give us the reasurance we need to make ourselves heard I will go back to my gp tonorrow morning and ddiscuss everything with her. Please can you add me on here I do not know how to use the site or even if you can add ppl I have not used a forum before. All the best xxx",
