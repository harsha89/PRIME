My Dr. was concerned about neuropathy because I already had a little in my toes from my diabetes. I have to say that after one dose, I am already feeling more tingling. I have the option of switching to weekly doses, but I really don't want to extend treatments if I don't have to. I'm wondering if anyone is dealing with neuropathy from Taxol and if anyone has had any luck reducing it. Thank you  Beth",

I finally signed up on a website where friends could sign up to bring meals, and did it 2 nights every 2 weeks...when I have chemo and the night when the SEs start getting bad. I only did it because people kept saying they wanted to do something and I almost felt selfish putting them off all the time. I'm finding that the longer I'm in treatment, the more bad days I have. The pain from the Taxol is lasting longer or flaring back up after I think it has ended. It's so frustrating. I admire those of you who are still working full time. Some days I can't do my part time hours, and I'm no wimp when it comes to pain and not feeling well. My good news today was I got to make my surgery planning appointment with my surgeon. One step closer!",

I had my last infusion on Feb 4, and I am already feeling more like my old self. I do still tire easily but I don't feel exhausted all of the time. Now I worry about surgery. Such a big change. Will it go ok? How will I feel after? Will I stay cancer free? So many unknowns and I don't like unknowns. I never lost all of the hair on my head. Did that happen to anyone else? I thought it was strange, but I kept my buzzed hair the whole time. If I had know that I wouldn't have taken the clippers to it.",

I started dose dense chemo on October 29th with Adriamycin and Cytoxan. So far I've been handling this part pretty well. Fatigue, heartburn and constipation have been my biggest complaints so far. I'm a bit concerned about starting Taxol next month, as I will have my first dose on Christmas Eve. I've handled the A/C pretty well and I'm concerned the Taxol will really knock me down. One weird thing I've noticed is day 11 seems to be a bad day for me. I'm more emotional, and today my stomach isn't feeling well. It seems odd that it's been day 11 both times so far, and when I am generally on an upswing. I'm looking forward to February 4th, when I should have my last chemo, then will make plans for my surgery.",

Swiss Kriss is available at GNC, and it is a natural stool softener. It works as well or better than Dulcolax. I've been dealing with really bad constipation from the start and it has really helped.

I take 2 at night and it keeps things moving for me. I had my 2nd of 4 Taxol treatments yesterday. The hot flashes have been awful! Driving me crazy. They didn't start with the Taxol, but they do seem more frequent. I never did lose all of my hair with AC, and I thought I would with Taxol but after reading some of your comments, maybe I won't. My eyebrows and eyelashes have gotten very thin. Not shaving has been nice LOL I have started taking a B100 complex and L-Glutamine for the neuropathy and it seems to help. I'm so glad my SEs on the Taxol haven't been bad enough to cause my MO to switch me to weekly taxol treatments. The only really bad SE has been the body pain. It was so bad and caught me totally off guard last time. I am better prepared for it this time. ",
