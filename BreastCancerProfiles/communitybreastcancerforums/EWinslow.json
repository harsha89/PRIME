I would like to hear from women with similar oncotype scores a few years out from their BC treatment and how they are doing now. Log in to post a reply",

I am pleased to hear you are doing so well.  I have recently been suffering the after affects of radiation. Acute pain began in my left breast two days after my last zap and continues more than three weeks out. Dr's can't tell me how long it will last. No fun. It takes all my energy and focus away. I would love to find that thread \"high oncotype score survivors\" and yes, I do realize that it is a relative term in this situation... ;-D I am drinking 8 cups of green tea, taking one low dose aspirin and eating mushrooms every day in an effort to ward off recurrence. Really afraid to start the tamoxifen even though I have been holding on to the pills for over a month now.  The hot flashes already come about every 20-30 minutes. Can't bear the thought of them being worse!!! How has the tamoxifen been for you and are you also taking the Aromasin?",
