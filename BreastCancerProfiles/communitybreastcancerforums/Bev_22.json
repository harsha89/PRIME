I have had 10 Abraxane chemo treatments and I am on Herceptin with Tykerb and a couple of other drugs. My HBG went to 6 and I had to have blood transfusion 3 units after 2 weeks of chemo. I have had to miss a week every 3rd week because of low WBC.  Now my Onc has changed me to Doxil.  He said that the tumor has not shrunk but he thought the nodes under my arm is less swollen.  My question is would my agressive IDC/ILC bc be getting a foothold when I missed a treatment?  At one point my Onc had said the tumor had shrunk.  I have 3 tumors but only one is large enough for him to feel. Thanks for all you do for us newbies.",
