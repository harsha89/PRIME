I had a lumpectomy two months ago- and at the hospital where the surgury was done adh was seen. At that time my BS sent my slides for a second look. This time FEA was found. Which from talking to my doctors means my risk is only minimally increased. Went to an oncologist and he sent them to a third pathogist. Where no atypia was seen. The 2nd a d third were from breast pathologist so from what I am told they r the experts. I go back next month to talk to the MO I think just closer monitoring is what I am going to be told. Sure hope so. A third opinion doesn't hurt.",
