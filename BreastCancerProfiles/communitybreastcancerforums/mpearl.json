I have made a decison to finally loose this baby weight and eat better. I am going to Barnes and Noble to get some healty diet books. thanks, MPearl",

I got my piece of paper in the mail last evening, Friday, too late to call anyone. I was home with my 3 little children, and started to loose it. My results said, Probably benign, follow up in 6 months. I then began to do a million googles and looked at the statistics. I have a 50% chance of someone that has a mamogram 1 finding in the next year to be dx with cancer.  I was close to fainting and I think I scared my oldest, 5 years old. Please tell emwhat my next step should be? I have an appointment with my Gyno on monday (coincidentally) I cant stop thinking that I am going to leave my children....I was not expecting this result. Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

I have implants...when the technician was taking the pictures she did say they wee the best kind though for seeing the breast. Wondering if there could be an issue with them? So, I will take it one step. I guess the good would be if there was something that needed treatment, obviously, it was discovered very early, I would imagine. It is still not want I wanted that piece of paper to read or what i was expecting. I am still a bit weepy, but am home with the kids alone so trying to keep busy with activities for them as well as do some laundry. (my husband is a Dr. and he working at the Hospital today) Thanks again. I really appreciate the help with my freak out.",
