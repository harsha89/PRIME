I'm 34 and I just finished chemo and a lumpectomy...radiation coming soon. You CAN get through this. I'm the biggest wimp and I cried through every pre-op, post-op, recovery, chemo infusion....but I got through it, so if I can get through this so can you! I know this is horrible and terrifying.  You're in my thoughts!",
