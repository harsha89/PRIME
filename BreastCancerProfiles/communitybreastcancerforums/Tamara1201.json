My Mother had that problem when she took Xeloda years ago, and basically it's like having a second degree burn and has to be treated as such. If it isn't blistered they told her to put a heavy duty moisturizer on it, like bag balm. I get it at Walmart or Walgreens, it's in a green can. It's thick like vaseline but has some added stuff in it, I use it on my feet to this day, just so I will have soft feet. If it's blistered the skin will peel off, I had to basically debride her skin, cutting off the dead part,and bandaged it with antibiotic ointment. Eventually it all peeled off and revealed baby soft pink skin, which she was very proud of because her feet were, well kind of ugly before. I think one of the big concerns, which goes with everything anymore, is the concern for infection, so keeping it clean is very important. I would think that as long as you don't feel like it's getting infected it could wait until you could talk to your doctor tomorrow, because I'm like you, the ER is the last place I want to be, and unfortunately it's a great place to get exposed to germs. hope it helps a little, good luck Tamara",

I've never smoked, but if I did, I doubt I would be able to quit right now, my Mother tried off and on for years, without success. As far as the alcohol I think the big thing is that the chemo can be so toxic to your liver, and so can alcohol, so they don't want you doing anything else than can damage your liver. They were supposed to start my chemo last Thursday, and didn't because my liver enzymes are elevated. I rarely drink, not that I didn't do more of it in my younger years, but I'm already on so much medicine that can damage my liver, I just avoid it. I had a CT of my abdomen Friday to see if something is going on in my liver, but with the increased liver enzymes, they have to lower the dose of the chemo, and as much as I'm not looking forward to this experience, I want it to take care of the problem, so hope I can get the full amount  Tamara",

I was so frustrated with myself, haven't written anything since, well until now I had 2nd treatment on July 2, hasn't been too bad, little nausea but I'm so exhausted I can hardly think. I get pretty severe fatigue from the Multiple Sclerosis, but this on top of it has made me worthless. I do still manage to make it to the store for essentials, and walk the dog every night for 15 or 20 minutes, but not at a very fast pace. I had my hair cut really short 2 weeks ago, was going to shave it but my daughters friend who is a hair dresser didnt' want to do that, so she just cut it short. I still have a fair amount of hair, but I had huge amounts, it was really fine. I have a bald spot, but I'm so tall not many people see it, guess that's a benefit of being tall lol. My scalp has been kind of sore today, so not sure if more is about to tall out or what. Zuzee, I'm sure your man friend will be okay with the bald head, my man friend told me he thought bald was sexy, now he could have been trying to make me feel better, because he loved my hair, but he really doesn't  act like he loss of hair I have had so far bothers him, guess we will see when it's all gone PAP, I too have had no appetite, which is unusual for me, I forget that I need to eat. I'm sure I get enough in overall, but really have to force myself sometimes. My taste is off, and when I do eat I feel like it just sits in my stomach forever so dont' want to eat for the rest of the day. I need to lose weight, but even this doesnt' seem to be doing it, still retaining fluids from the steroids. Laura, I live in Florida, and it's way too hot here to wear a wig. I forget sometimes that my hair is just about all gone, until I look in a mirror. I get some strange looks too, but most of the people I see are tourist so I'll never see them again anyway. It does feel really strange in the shower though, used to take me forever to rinse my hair, so I'm saving lots of time, and $$$ lol Becky, that is a wierd feeling in the shower, having no hair to pull back and squeeze water out of. I also keep thinking I feel it behind me when I'm laying down, and need to pull it ouf of the way. It is much cooler in this heat, feeling the breeze blowing across my scalp is an odd feeling, I worry about taking supplements because I have to be careful with the Multiple Sclerosis, I cant' take anything that stimulates the immune system, because my immune system attacks my nervous system, so in theory it could make it worse. I really need to go see a Nutritionist, if I ever get enough energy. I hope everyone has a nice, SE free weekend  Tammy",

My daughter is going to shave it tonight, or in the morning, but if you cut it really short, are all of those really short hairs irritating when they fall out? seems like they would get stuck in clothes and sheets.

I thought I posted something earlier, but I guess I must have forgotten to hit a button, because I can't find it, if it's a duplicate I apoligize. I think I kind of lost some of this message again, when I messed up and tried to cut and past, so if it doens't make a lot of sense, blame it on the steroids, although in reality it's a daily experience in my life :-)   I was supposed to start chemo today, cytoxan and taxotere, took my steroids last night, slept maybe 3 hrs, took more this morning, then when I got there and was talking with my doctor found out my liver enzymes were elevated. I have to get them checked every three months for some other meds I take, and they were fine in February, so not sure what's up, of course when we were discussing the possible cause, he had to mention that liver cancer would do that, but I'm thinking positive that is is something else.. We decided to redraw them, and I have to get a CT of my abdomen, and try again next week. The good news is I can get the CT done tomorrow afternoon, so should be able to get the report Monday or Tuesday, so I won't have long to wait. I have been so tired all afternoon, but couldn't sleep thanks to the steroids, or even rest, so hopefully I will sleep tonight. Jo, I'm sorry you had such a bad reaction, I know that must have been scary. I read another post on here where, of course I don't have a clue which one, someone had the same reaction, I think she said they gave her more benadryl and slowed the infusion down, and she tolerated it okay then. I hope you do better tomorrow. I have looked at some wigs, and will probably get one for \"special occassions\"  my insurance will come part of it, if I go to a network provider. The closest one is about 40 miles away, so I'm not sure if I'm going to do that, or just get one locally and send it in and they should pay, just not as much. I live in Florida, and it's soooooooo hot and humid, I'm really not sure I would want to wear it very often. I have never been a hat or scarf person either, but I think I'm about to become one.  I  did decide that summer is a good time to not have hair in Florida, when I was drying my hair the other night, it takes so long, and I get so hot, my head sweats so much it's wet again before I finish drying it, I decided I really wouldn't miss that for a while, and I decided I would save all kinds of $$ on shampoo and conditioner and getting my hair done, oh and no need for mascara for a while. I have blonde eyelashes and eye brows, so not having them won't be a big difference, I too like most of you am trying to find some positive points in the whole experience I am going to a, I think it's \" Look good feel better\" that is sponsered by the ACS that is supposed to help you with ways to look like you have them, even when you don't, we shall see  Anyway, good luck to all of you, thanks for listening  Tamara",

I wish I had your weather, ours is hotter than normal, heat index this afternoon was 115, needless to say I don't go outside much.  I hope you all have a nice weekend",

One of my downstairs neighbors didn't like when the dust went on his balcony, not sure how he will feel about the hair lol. I have been having headaches a lot, but I'm not sure why. I have a history of migraines but they had been under control with the medicine for my heart. I feel like the way my scalp hurts it could be contributing to them. Greymom_17, I've been walking around with one of those rolling sticky lint removers trying to catch hair, well that and my plastic grocery bag that I put my hair in when I run my fingers thru it and pull out handfulls lol We are going to shave it tomorrow, does that help make your scalp any less sore? Bonnid, sorry about the fever, hope the cipro takes care of it. I have my second TC treatment this coming Thursday, so I guess you are a week ahead of me. I have trouble keeping up with who has written when I write too, confuse myself and end up not making any sense, not that I ever made a lot of sense Zuzeee, I actually really like the short hair cut I got for my hair to fall out, and I probably would never have gotten it if it weren't for the fact that it would be falling out. It's been much easier to take care of that I had expected, so who knows, when it grows back, it might not have to grow quiet as far as it started",

I finished chemo the middle of August, had some peach fuzz on my head, then it started falling out again the first week in Sept so I shaved it again, had all these different lengths and textures of hair, so I just got rid of it. Now I have about 1/2 inch of hair, maybe a little more, but it's growing in all kinds of colors, light in the front, maybe blonde/gray, but the back is really dark, my daughter says I'm going to have black hair!  If so it's not fair that my eyebrows and eyelashes are growing back blonde, like they were. I guess time will tell, and whatever it is, it will be hair and I can get the color fixed if I need to lol.  I started Rads the middle of Sept, 25 regular and 8 boost, I have my last boost Monday. My skin has done really well, just a little sun burned looking, which is surprising because I am so pale it was kind of expected that I would do worse.I have been very tired, but I have Multiple Sclerosis, which makes me tired to begin with, but this just makes it worse.The most frustrating part is I will be exhausted in the afternoon, and try to take a nap, but just can't go to sleep. gjlanders, hope you have fun in Dublin, sounds very exciting!  Did they put tattoos on you to line up the machine or just the marks? I have 3 very small tattoos, to help line up the machine, and then they put an X on my chest, with a sharpie, to make it easier, and put tape over that. I was surpsied how long it would stay on there.  Just make sure you don't put any thing on your skin before you go for your treatments, they told me that is what causes the most problems. It's such a habit, I nearly put deodorant under that arm several times and had to wash it off. I hope everyone has a great weekend, sorry for such a long post, I've been told I write like I talk lol",

It's a swear word I really don't use, or say out loud, and least not very often, but somehow seems appropriate for the chemo ordeal. I'm 5 months PFC, my hair started coming back, peach fuzz, toward the end of my chemo TC X 4, but it started falling out again and looked weird, so I shaved it again the first of Sept. I have maybe an inch of hair, it's hard to tell it's so curly. I have had all of my life board straight blonde hair and it came back in curly, dark and gray. The gray isn't really surprising, but the dark, almost black part is. My eyelashes and eye brows fell out after I finiished chemo, and I'm really not sure exactly when they came back but didn't seem to take too long. I have always had blonde brows and lashes, and they came back that way, so didn't notice at first, I told my doctor it's just not fair that my hair comes in dark and my lashes don't. I would put a picture in here, but not sure how to do that, might have to break down and read directions lol. I made an appt to get my hair colored, but decided to wait a bit and see what it does. Everyone tells it me looks good, but I feel like I'm looking at a stranger when I look in the mirror. Has anyone heard of your hair turning back to it's normal color after a while? Dr Oz had something on last week about why hair grays, and talked about the, well I'm not sure if it was a gland or what, but something in your scalp that that gives hair it's pigmet and how stress can damage it. Probably wishfull thinking on my part lol. I think I'm going to look for that Lancome eyebrow color too, I've never been very good at putting that stuff on, looks funny to me, but it's worth a shot",

I did actually shave my head again after the last treatment, I had a mohawk, or shark fin, look on top, about 1\" blonde standing straight up, and \"fuzz\" on the side, looked more  like duck down than hair, and it was falling out again at the same time, so I just decided to shave it so it would all be growing at the same time, but mostly because of the hair falling out. ccbaby, your hair is beautiful, I'm looking forward to the bangs day myself, even though I've never been one for bangs, too many cowlicks lol.  I'm sure it is difficult being a hair dresser and dealing with so many people who are unhappy with their hair, when you didn't have any. It does grow, but seems slowly, and I had straight blonde hair before, and now it's curly and, well salt and pepper, never had hair this dark. Everyone tells me it looks good, but to me it's like looking at a stranger in the mirror. I want to do something to the color, but decided to wait until it grows a bit more.  My eyebrows and lashes came back blonde, although they have fallen out and growing back for the second time, have like 3 long lashes on my left eye and the rest are really short, everytime I try to put on mascara I wonder why I am doing that. I read on here a lot, but don't post usually because I have a hard time remembering who said what, but enjoy reading and am inspired by all the strong women on this site, and appreciate the helpful hints.",

Not a pretty curly though, an aggravating curly, like kinky curls in the under layers and if I let my hair dry by it's self now, as opposed to blow drying it, it looks really crazy, with kinks, curls and waves. My hair has always been darker underneath, so I figure there is no telling what it will be like once I lose it, and it starts growing back, imagine there will be a fair amount of gray, but my hair dresser can always fix that, eventually.

My eyelashes and eyebrows came back blonde, like they have always been, said it's not fair my hair got darker and my lashes didn't. You know, I prepared myself for it falling out, but I don't think I got past that, I mean I knew it could come back differently, but didn't really think about it.

I've had my hair trimmed twice, more to shape, but I think if I stretch the hair on the top of my head out, it's 5\" long.  I love those short haircuts, has anyone seen something for short, VERY curly hair, now it just does what it wants to? I've always had very straight hair, so I'm just at a loss as to what to do with this. I'm keeping the sides and back trimmed until the top grows out some, this is what my hair dresser said to do, if not I get real wings on the sides, still do some. I'm trying to wait until it grows some to color it because I'd rather get it highlighted instead of whole head coloring, but I'm not sure if I'm going to make it. I have found that really curly hair needs lots of conditioner, like condition in in the shower, and then add leave in condtioner, but still wild at times. I'm thankful to have hair, but still feel like I'm looking at a stanger in the mirror sometimes. I hope everyone is doing well, and hair grows swiftly ",

I had my last chem taxotere and cytoxin, 9 weeks ago. I started getting some peach fuzz, or more like duck whatever it's called lol, about 2 weeks out, then at 3 it started falling out again so I shaved it, again. Now I have maybe 3/4 of an inch, and I say it looks like a calico cat, all kinds of colors. I had shoulder length blonde hair, well with some gray, and I'm not sure what it will be now, but it's hair and I can work with it whatever it is. I've not really worn a wig, too hot here in Florida and my head sweats anyway. I thought I might use one some now that it's cooler if I have somewhere special to go. My question is, the eyebrows and eyelashes, how long do they take to come back? I have always had blonde eyelashes and eyebrows, so it's not a big loss, but I started to put some mascara on last week and realized I only an occasionaly lash left, looked funny to say the least. I was thinking I might buy some of that lash stuff, to help them grow, I looked on drugstore.com and the rapid lash renewal serum had good reviews. Have any of you heard anything about any of these products? I've read about the latisse, but I have blue eyes and I'd hate for it turn my blue eyes brown. Isn't that the opposite of some song? lol  Sorry my post is so long, I've been told I write like I talk, and I'm not sure it was a compliment :-)",
