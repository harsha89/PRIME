This past menstrual cycle my breast were beyond tender while I was in the ovulation process, I thought I was pregnant for a second so I quickly took a home pregnancy test (2 actually week apart) came out negative. I notice when doing a self breast exam a lump on my right breast, didn't think much of it I until I was bothering me and hurting... went with my dr and he said it all looked and felt normal. I was not agreeing with him so I requested to get an U/S. U/S was today and I'm waiting for my results. Due to this I am having major stress/anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. Just like many of you I have the pain the radiates to my back, arm, under arm and shoulder. I'm still wondering if this is due to anything I can possibly have or just stress I'm putting on myself . As we al know on here, it's a very frustrating and scary situation. Also I get like a pinching / stinging feeling on my breast. Don't have an skin change or discharge on my breast. I'm worried of what this could be.",
