I'd have to say the first day was the worst for me, but I'm learning to take my meds BEFORE nausea hits. Newbie, will get the hang of it. I wish all of you the best as you start - once we get one behind us, then we just keep counting down. I pray for very little SE's for all of us, especially the nausea. Love, Ellzig",

I will have AC 4x every 2 wks and T 4x every 2 weeks. I will let you know how I make out and SE's. I'm going to drink plenty of water before hand, keeping myself well hydrated. Also maybe a laxative, for constipation. I already bought a wig and will be buzzed Oct. 3 (don't want to watch my long brown hair fall out). I look forward to getting to know other ladies with bc as we go through this journey. The best thing for me I've found is my faith in God and a crazy sense of humor. It helps alot! Ellzig",

When I go to work tomorrow they moved me to an office - I'll be able to \"trot\" to a bathroom nearby (work in a school). I've started to notice bone pain in my foot of all places! Go figure... Ladies, let me know how you are doing during the week. Water and gingerale have been my drinks du jour lately. Actually ate out with friends yesterday which was really encouraging. Ellen",

Thankfully the wig is ok - pretty much matched my hairstyle so I should be good to go on Monday. So far no pain from Neulasta shot on the 1st, took Claritan. Anyone know about tea tree oil shampoo? They used it on my head yesterday and it felt so good! How about lotions and creams when we start losing the hair and the scalp gets dry? I'm not wearing my wig at home.... Next Chemo is Oct. 14. Does anyone know if each chemo is worse and worse? I hope not.",
