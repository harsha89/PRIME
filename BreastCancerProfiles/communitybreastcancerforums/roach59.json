I don't want to be the cyclops from Greek myth. Sorry, for jumping in like this. This will all be Ok somewhere down the line. E Roach",

I prefer a good red, I'm originally from the state of Washington, I know how good the wine is on the west coast. However, My cocktail was AC on Mondays and Taxotere on Tuesdays for 6 cycles. On the 28th of this month I'll have surgery (mastectomy) most likely followed by radiation and chemo again if any cancer is found in my nodes. I started with an almost 6cm tumor, Stage 3 because of size, Grade 3, with extensive cancer in my nodes and negative on all counts for the hormone treatment that's in vogue. The treatment was extremely aggressive, but it has significantly reduced the tumor and has all but eliminated the cancer in my lymph nodes. This is truly amazing! I'm 48, married to a southerner (they talk so cute), I have a beautiful 13 year old daughter. Last year she was pretty and pink, now she's a little rocker babe! I was just the same way. Question: Compare the drainage tubes to the port, which is more obnoxious? And if you don't mind, are either of you planning on reconstruction down the road? thanks, Elaine",

However, this cancer's aggression pails in comparison to my oncologist's level of aggression. It's Hard Rock all the way but it works. I never got sick, never was in pain, I have irritating side effects now that it's over but all in all you'll surprise yourself once you start. The fatigue is hard at times. I'm still waiting to get my groove back. But, it will come back. As for the leukemia, someone else may have to answer that, I've not meet anyone with those conditions. Don't be scared there are tons of women here to hold your hand if you want. Good night I'll be thinking about you. Elaine",

It was a long hot summer! I will know within a matter of days whether the tumor site holds any lingering cancer, if so I go in for radiation. The cancer had been extensive in my nodes pre chemo. The breast MRI and Pet scan both came back negative for cancer in the nodes post chemo. But, I'm beginning to learn that pathology is the absolute answer. So we'll see in a few days. Wish me luck, but I'll let y'all know either way. I am/was a Stage 3/ Grade 3 Neg for all that other stuff. Bye for now. Elaine",

The chemo truly was do-able. I never got ill, never was in pain. I was pooped at times and I am not happy with the weight gain and the minor' but irritating side effects of the taxotere and steroids. However, I will not complain, the stuff worked! I had an extremely large tumor that was extremely aggressive and it's damn near vanished. For me, walking into chemo wasn't as frightening as this upcoming surgery. How does that break down? You'll do just fine. You'll surprise yourself. You'll learn a great deal too. Have a good day. roach59",

During surgery the SN was positive, so she took all those little buggers. 9 out of 19 came back positive. But, I ws actually expecting it. I'm not even upset. I had an extremely large tumor, with cancer extensively in my nodes.Having chemo first did a bang up job, and maybe the surgery got every last bit of it. But, I'll buy front row tickets for another round of chemo, followed by radiation to get this nasty stuff out of me! I'm home from the hospital and in zero pain, the drains are a pain and look stupid under my clothes, but they'll be out soon. I'm so happy to be home watching silly shows with my daughter, and drinking coffee with my husband. And my dog hasn't left my side since I got home yesterday. Life is good.",

They're very sweet, but I was in much better shape than any of us expected. So, my daughter got spoiled by her grandparents and that was just fine with her! I've got a few more weeks before chemo begins again. This time it's Gemzar and something else. First round was monster doses of AC and Taxotere. My Onc says hair will continue to grow on these new ones, I hope so, I like the peach fuzz I'm getting back. My husband and daughter love rubbing my head! Go Harley, I believe this is your last day CHEMO! YEAH! I'll toast to that tonight! AnnaAnne- Where in Oregon? I grew up across the lake from Seattle and have spent many a day roaming around the great Pac NW. My step-son is now in Portland and loves it! Go Ducks! Good Day from steamy Alabama.",
