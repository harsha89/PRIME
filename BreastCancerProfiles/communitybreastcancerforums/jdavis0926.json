She had one the day before also. She had just returned from a trip to Florida and had even carried her luggage on the plane. She sometimes said she was tried but had completed two weeks of nutritional conditionings in Florida which included swimming exercise, etc. She had completed her third round of Chemo for Breast Cancer three weeks earlier and was scheduled to state another round this week. After returning from Florida she visited her oncologist complaining of a cough and shortness of breath and was given a round of antibiotics for pneumonia that ended the day before she starting vomiting. She was more than functional but her recent sickness raised alarms and she was taken to Hopkins where she was tested for virus, bacteria and fungus that maybe cause the pneumonia. In the meantime she was treated antibiotic and anti fungus meds. When the test came back negative, the doctors than started to focus of the posssibility that the cancer may be causing the problem with fluied in her lungs. She had another coughing spell while in the hospital and had real trouble breathing and the decision was made to put her on a ventilator.Her oxygen levels seem to be pretty stable now a 60 percent and there is even some hope that it maybe lowered to 50%. the staff and doctors at Hopkin have been providing my daughter with a very high level of care but they has also pretty much rejected any ideal of her receiving any cancer treatment while on the ventilator. I have asked about targeted radiation, other treatment than chemo and they appear to think it would be a waste of time. Does anyone know of a treatment that can be used in this case.
