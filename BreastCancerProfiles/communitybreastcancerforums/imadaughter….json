I had a mammo at 30 because of the strong history of bc in my family.  Everything came back fine but the tech said I had very very dense breast tissue.  I thought that is a good thing, but some stuff I read talks about dense tissue being bad.  Does anyone know if that even really means much?

      "Content": "imadaughter wrote: Hello everyone, I have been on the board before but it had been awhile and I could not remember my old user name so I created a new account. My mom was diagnosed with BC a year ago. She is stage IV with mets to the spine, pelvis, shoulder, liver, and lungs. She is also ER/PR - and HER2 +++.  She is currently on Taxol and Carboplatin I think.  They have had to make changes.  She also receives Herceptin once a week. She had been doing really well, but lately her tumor markers keep going up.  It is the CA 27-29 (I think that is what it is called) They were down to 46 then up to 80 then 87 now they are up to 99.  She doesn't meet with her doctor until next week, but I was wondering if this could be a sign that things are progressing. Her last PET scan still showed the lesions but most of them had shrunk some.  I know that other things can cause the rise, but she has not started any new medicine, chemo, etc for a while now.  I just like to know what I am dealing with before her so I can help her through it.  If I prepare myself first I can better handle and help my family. Thank you for any input. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "imadaughter wrote: Hello, I was just wondering on average how long a person is on chemo.  I know things change, if you dont respond you try a different one, side effects try a different one, etc but do you usually stay on chemo until you are NED?  I am sure there are a lot of different answers and it depends on the situation so this may just be a dumb question to ask anyways. MY mom has been getting Taxotere and cisplatin and herceptin for 10 months now.  She gets them every week.  I was just wondering if this is something she will just contiue to do until something changes or at what point they say okay you are good to stop for awhile.  She is stage iv mets to liver/lungs/bones as of last scan they are considering her stable Her2+ er/pr- Thanks Log in to post a reply",
