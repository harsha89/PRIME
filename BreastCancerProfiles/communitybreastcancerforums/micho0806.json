It's been a battle I've been fighting since I was 28. I was so young that they sent me away from Radiology the first time I went for a mammogram; they told me there must be a mistake.  Of course there wasnt, and my mammograms were always followed up with ultrasounds.  My first biopsy was that year and it showed Radial scar and some other abnormal stuff but I was assured it wasn't cancer.  Two years later, another lump, another surgery scheduled.  I canceled.  I have small breasts to begin with and wasn't really happy with the prospect of having more cut out especially when this \"new\" procedure, needle biopsy, was available.  I made an appt. at Mass General Breast care center and have never gone anywhere since.  That lump was diagnosed as hammertoma.  I followed up with regular visits for years, until finally I was told I could continue with my yearly exams at the OB/gYN office.  this last yearly exam showed a lump that my nurse practitioner felt (I had not).  After a core biopsy & a surgical excision, I now have the diagnosis of ADH, radial scar, and some fibro changes (?) .  I have a high risk appt. scheduled in a few weeks.  Now I feel this big unknown is just looming over my head.  It's scarey, but I expected it for some reason..",
