The pathology was worse than expected, however. My tumor, which showed up on MRIs as 5.5 cm, measured 10.5 cm. My lymph nodes had shown no involvement on multiple MRIs, but in surgery I had 4 of 35 showing metametastasis, with one sentinel node quite large. With HER2 positive cancer, I'm quite worried. The two types of chemo tried before surgery (TCHP and AC) were apparently not effective. I will be having five weeks of proton radiation. I meet with my oncologist tomorrow and hope to get some answers about whether we can try more chemo now. It seems to me that it's likely that cancer cells have spread, and I'd rather address them while they're floating around out there before they metastasize. I'm not sure that's possible with how chemo works. I was hoping to feel relieved after surgery, but that hasn't happened. Right now I'm trying to focus on healing from surgery and thinking about how to get back into my life, including being back in the classroom this fall. I've had family here to help for the last 2 weeks and they're gone now. It's just my husband and me and I have the feeling rough days are ahead.",

It's been three weeks since my last chemo TX and about 3 months since my last dose of herceptin. From MRIs and external exams, it appears that the tumor isn't getting larger, but hasn't gotten smaller either. The tumor is fairly large, aggressive, and HER2 positive. I'm eager for it to be gone! I'm trying to enjoy these few weeks of normalcy between chemo and surgery. I'm having trouble not worrying about the tumor growing in the meantime, however. Tonight I found what looks like a bug bite on top of the tumor area. I know it's probably nothing, but it's something else to worry about. Can't wait to get through these two weeks and get the darned thing removed! Thanks to everyone here for sharing their experiences. Reading your posts helps me focus on the concrete aspects of surgery rather than worrying about what this disease is doing in the meantime.",

I found ditching the wig (and even hats as it's gotten warmer) easier by starting out in places where I wouldn't run into anyone I knew (a Costco an hour from home). Then I graduated to a walk around my block. That was harder, but led to a conversation with someone who was starting treatment. After that, I decided that for me, not hiding the baldness felt more authentic in most circumstances. I also hope it helps normalize the reality of medical side effects and reduce the shame some patients feel, as well as the fear caused by misperceptions that chemo causes full disability in all patients. I still wear hats for comfort (temperature and sun exposure) but remove them freely. I wear my wig when I feel my baldness (as evidence of illness) will detract from my purpose or the purpose of a gathering, for example, when attending a work event where I want the focus to be on the expertise I'm sharing, not on my treatment. I have been working from home, part time, throughout treatment, so those in-person events have been limited and usually only run a couple of hours. I am a professor, and when I head back to work on campus in the fall, I know I will not be wig-wearing. It is too distracting to me, and a full day of it too uncomfortable. I should finish chemo in late June, so I'm not expecting to have much hair two months later. This board has really helped me think through my personal philosophy of head covering. In the midst of circumstances where I have little control over many aspects of life, it's felt good to consider the range of options regarding hair loss in a thoughtful way. Thanks for helping with that! ",

The liver was more concerning, but happily responded well to TDM2. I got moved to Xeloda/Tykerb after 6 rounds of TDM1 because the lung nodules were growing. After three cycles of Xeloda, the liver may still be okay, but the lung nodules are growing and spreading, now in both lungs. We've tried 6 different kinds of chemo. The bottom line is that my cancer does not respond to chemo, hust laughs in its face. While I'm HER2 positive, I also haven't had a good response to Herceptin or Perjeta. At this point, it's looking like the options are to continue trying chemo simply to be doing something, consider a Phase 1 trial here at Mayo (we don't even know if there's an appropriate one available, but will look into it), or go off treatment and handle symptoms as they arise until the end. I'm pretty sure I'm not interested in taking dramatic measures to pursue treatment at all costs. In my heart, I know I would be mad at myself if I wind up on my deathbed having spent the previous months on ineffective treatment rather than living the good days while I have them. At the rate that the lung nodules are growing, my oncologist's best guess that I'll have several months before it becomes life threatening. Lots to process here. I don't mind dying, but it's kind of sad to think of all I will miss. I really hate the pain that it brings to my family.

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2018 09:58PM - edited Apr 25, 2018 10:12PM by Snowfall First, thank you all for your kind responses. It's been six weeks since my progression scan results. They've been tough weeks for me and my husband, and probably for family and friends as well. It's scary being off treatment when you know you have an aggressive cancer. I have been accepted into the DS-8201a Phase II trial. I'm excited to be in the trial, because the drug has been pretty successful for people with my treatment history and pathology. I probably won't get my first infusion until May 15th, 9 weeks from when I stopped Xeloda and Tykerb and almost 7 months since my last progression-free scan. I'm hoping the fact that I'm not dead yet means the cancer is somewhat less aggressive at this point than they thought it might be. Next week, I go for all my baseline scans. I'm not nervous about the process, but I am steeling myself for unpleasant results. We will be using CT scans rather than PET scans, so I know the measurement variables will be entirely different and more precise for my mets in lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. Nine weeks off treatment almost certainly means progression. I'm going to have another brain scan, which has me a little nervous. My last one was in May 2017 and showed no mets, but that was before the mets were detected elsewhere. I'm still pretty much symptom-free. I notice various physical changes, but can easily attribute them to things other than cancer. I'm tired and sleeping more than I usually do, and I seem to have a cold that won't quit. Cold medicine helps the cough and rough breathing, so I figure either Vicks has a cure for cancer that they haven't recognized yet or it really is just a cold and not dramatic progression in my lungs. At this point I am focused on finishing out the semester (I'm a college prof) and getting ready for treatment. The trial site is an 8-hour drive from home, and I'll have to be there for three or four days out of each of the first 5 to 6 weeks. After that, treatment is just every third week. I've tried to get my work colleaguesprepared for me being on a wacky schedule or unavailable in the fall semester, but it's hard to know what to say to them. I look and seem healthy. They know about my diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan and have been very supportive so far, but I hate to leave them in a lurch. On the other hand, I may be feeling great by September and be able to work almost full-time. The uncertainty is frustrating, so I find myself focusing more on today. Again, thanks for the support here. I post rarely, because my case is unusual in that I am in the small group of nonresponders to HER2 directed therapies, so I don't know that my experience is very helpful for others. I read every day, and you all help motivate me to get out there and live my life, whatever that means for that day. S",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2018 10:01PM - edited Apr 25, 2018 10:08PM by Snowfall (Cross-posted from another thread, but want to get the mention of the DS-8201a Phase II trial out for other liver metsters.) It's been six weeks since my progression scan results. They've been tough weeks for me and my husband, and probably for family and friends as well. It's scary being off treatment when you know you have an aggressive cancer. I have been accepted into the DS-8201a Phase II trial. I'm excited to be in the trial, because the drug has been pretty successful for people with my treatment history and pathology. I probably won't get my first infusion until May 15th, 9 weeks from when I stopped Xeloda and Tykerb and almost 7 months since my last progression-free scan. I'm hoping the fact that I'm not dead yet means the cancer is somewhat less aggressive at this point than they thought it might be. Next week, I go for all my baseline scans. I'm not nervous about the process, but I am steeling myself for unpleasant results. We will be using CT scans rather than PET scans, so I know the measurement variables will be entirely different and more precise for my mets in lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. Nine weeks off treatment almost certainly means progression. I'm going to have another brain scan, which has me a little nervous. My last one was in May 2017 and showed no mets, but that was before the mets were detected elsewhere. I'm still pretty much symptom-free. I notice various physical changes, but can easily attribute them to things other than cancer. I'm tired and sleeping more than I usually do, and I seem to have a cold that won't quit. Cold medicine helps the cough and rough breathing, so I figure either Vicks has a cure for cancer that they haven't recognized yet or it really is just a cold and not dramatic progression in my lungs. At this point I am focused on finishing out the semester (I'm a college prof) and getting ready for treatment. The trial site is an 8-hour drive from home, and I'll have to be there for three or four days out of each of the first 5 to 6 weeks. After that, treatment is just every third week. I've tried to get my work colleaguesprepared for me being on a wacky schedule or unavailable in the fall semester, but it's hard to know what to say to them. I look and seem healthy. They know about my diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan and have been very supportive so far, but I hate to leave them in a lurch. On the other hand, I may be feeling great by September and be able to work almost full-time. The uncertainty is frustrating, so I find myself focusing more on today. Thanks for the support here. I post rarely, because my case is unusual in that I am in the small group of nonresponders to HER2 directed therapies, so I don't know that my experience is very helpful for others. I read every day, and you all help motivate me to get out there and liv my life, whatever that means for that day. S",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2018 11:20PM - edited Apr 25, 2018 11:29PM by Snowfall MomATT, I appreciate you sharing Dani's experience. I followed her excruciating treatment history and have no words to describe how sorry I am that she and you and her family went through all of that. I hear you about the risks associated with trials. I have tried six different chemos, and they've all had virtually no effect, other than TDM1, which worked for three cycles. All of the treatment changes were made after progression measurable in scans. I had herceptin for more than 6 months, and it was not effective, at least not to the degree that it usually is in people with HER2 positive cancer. Tykerb, which targets HER2 positive cancers, was also not effective. In short, I am the person on the unlucky side of all the statistics. This is probably more than a matter of luck. There is probably something about my cancer that makes it resistant to the treatments that have been successful for so many. Standard of care would be to try herceptin, which has already not worked, with other kinds of chemo that are in the same classes as the chemos that have already failed. My doctors would be very happy to follow that route if I wanted to, but they agree with me that it doesn't seem that current standard-of-care chemos are going to be my answer. Two other routes were suggested, both involving trials. One is for DS-8201a, the other is to see if there are any immunotherapy options at somewhere like Dana Farber. I am wary of trials, largely because many of them seem interruptive of daily life. I understand that I am not likely to live into my 80s (I'm currently in my 50s). That said, I would like the life I have to be as much as possible about doing the work I think is important and spending time with the people I love. I am not willing to let my medical treatment become my primary activity. Others might choose differently, but that's just me. That means I have limited willingness for medical travel, etc. The DS-8201a trial is reasonably convenient and overlaps with my real life in positive ways. They also report fairly impressive results. They scan every six weeks, so I should have a pretty good idea of how and where the treatment is or is not working. We are also hoping that because I had a positive if limited response to TDM1, a similar kind of treatment might be effective. Between the convenience and the possibility of good results, I'm willing to allow the trial into my life. So that's where I'm coming from. I would love for this drug to be the silver bullet I need to get this cancer stable or in remission. There are no promises, but the other available treatment options don't seem likely to be successful, so I'm willing to give it a try. Fingers crossed and prayer beads rattling! S",

I had an expander placed for reconstruction surgery and then we discovered aggressive metastasis. At that point I was put on chemo and was told that removing the expander wasn't an option because elective surgery would be unwise until we had the cancer under control, if ever. In an odd twist, my mastectomy incision opened up and because of the risk of infection they had to reopen the surgical site, which gave them the chance to take the expander out. I did not have them put in an implant. I had planned DIEP surgery and a reduction, so there was not enough skin to leave me balanced with an implant. I'm thrilled to have the expander gone, but without that twist of luck I'd have been left with it in, possibly forever. If you have the chance to get yours out now, I'd take it.",

Unfortunately, we discovered the metastasis, and that took precedence. I don't imagine I will ever be happy to set aside treatment to allow for reconstruction surgery even if I get to NEAD. Luckily, my surgical incisions sprain open and we had to do emergency surgery to combat potential infection, which meant that I could have them remove the expander. It was quite uncomfortable and I would not be happy leaving it in indefinitely. I have a silicone prosthesis and a polyfill stuffed knitted knocker. I wear one or the other depending on what I'm doing on a given day. I usually wear the silicone if I'm leaving the house, and use the knitted knocker at home or when exercising. I sew a lot and all my life have used my left chest as a pincushion area. I worry that I will poke the silicone and spring a leak! It turns out the knitted knocker makes a great pin cushion! Neither are as uncomfortable as I expected them to be. It did take some getting used to, but within a couple months I kind of had my system down. Just my two sense, of course. My decisions are no doubt shaded by the fact that my doctors do not have a lot of hope that we will find long-acting treatments that are effective for my largely unresponsive cancer. I'm not interested in 2 months or more of recovery given the short timeline I may be on. I have other things to do!",

So far, not much by way of SEs, but I understand they're cumulative over time. I have had increased acid reflux, which I'm treating with ranitidine and Tums. I'll be talking to my onc about other reflux treatments next week. I suspect I will have to make some dietary changes. Goodbye, coffee! I'm working thru a bad bout of plantar fascitis (unrelated to cancer) which always leaves me feeling achy and fatigued, so I'm attributing them to the PF rather than to the chemo. My biggest challenge is consistently having two meals 12ish hours apart. I'm aiming to eat around 6 am and 6 pm, but I'm not mastering the part where I need to get up and eat breakfast. I've just started back at work after a year of setting my own schedule while working from home. Morning alarms are hard!",
