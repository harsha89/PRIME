Do what's driving this cell 'hyper\" growth in various areas.    I also cancelled by colonoscopy--can't do the prep during the Christmas holidays.  I just find it ironic that everyone is running around getting the H1N1 flu vaccine to prevent \"the flu\" but I would induce worse digestive chaos for the colonoscopy than I have every experienced from a flu- Hoping and praying to be in the 95%! ",

It took a very experienced internist to feel my thyroid nodules during an annual \"check everything under the hood\" examine.  My doc \"looks for all the over 50 stuff\"--so did a very careful check on the thyroid and voila--So, last week I saw the endocrinologist who confirmed multiple nodules on each lobe of the thyroid and went ahead and did the fine needle aspiration. Waiting for results.  I could slightly detect a \"difference\" in swallowing--and not all the time. Now that I know where they are, I can find them myself.   The fine needle biopsy was nothing compared to breast biopsies of all types.  Waiting for pathology results. ",
