    "Content": "marciasdaughter wrote: I am writing this on behalf of my sister who is Stage 4 and on Faslodex. Today at her dental check-up the x-rays showed that everyone of her teeth has decay and one is chipped. The doctor added that it appears as though her teeth are worn down as well perhaps from grinding. She is very upset because the Faslodex has been keeping her in remission. She has been on it for almost eight months. The dentist said this is definitely related to the drug. Her X-ray just one year ago was perfect. Any sharing or comments or ideas are welcome.
