You have such a good attitude, I wish you much success in your treatment journey.  Lilac",

Thank you all for your thoughts and Lena for a very thoughtful post with lots of info to think about. I got up sick again this a.m., Easter Sunday.  I'd love to go to Mass, but I feel like crap and just can't do it.  Is a little thing like that too much to ask for QOL?  Lilac Don't misunderstand, I'm not ready to die, I'm just wondering if the time I have left would be better without all the poisons that I'm putting into myself.",
