Breast cancer is very prevalent with this syndrome as is ovarian cancer so I have to do a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy within the next year and when I am ready (35 yrs old with no kids) a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. I'd say you're already halfway there since you did BSO surgery. But I understand, the idea of doing a prophylactic mastectomy is terrifying, my breast oncologist Dr. Julia Smith is having me meet with a breast surgeon and plastic surgeon next week so that I can feel less scared about everything and also have a team in place when I am ready to proceed. She also said that for us who are doing it as a preventative measure we have the advantage of not having to be rushed unlike others who have to do this due to a current cancer.  This site is obviously an excellent resource and once you feel more comfortable you can start researching which options you may feel best for you. I plan on having a bilateral nipple/skin sparing mastectomy with one-step reconstruction. I also plan on doing fat grafting to help minimize rippling since I'm on the thin side. I did all the research for my sister which ultimately ended up benefiting me as well. We learned of our mutation after she had been diagnosed.  My identical twin had her surgery back in May (hers was due to breast cancer and not prophylactic) and she is slowly but surely becoming active again. She returned to working remotely 5 weeks out of surgery, and has stayed active walking etc. Her doctor cleared her for physical therapy after 8 weeks and she said that has really helped her a lot.  This is an incredibly difficult situation to deal with but luckily there are others who are going through the same thing and can help provide guidance and support. ",
