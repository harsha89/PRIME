Want to share what my doctor recommended beyond Aquaphor: Calendula (from the Garden Marigold). If that doesn't help she said go straight to pure Aloe Vera.  Here are sources for Calendula: Boiron makes Calendula Cream. It is considered homeopathic. I found it at the Walgreens in our hospital. Sometimes it is in First Sid section. It is non- greasy and rubs right in. Target sells California Baby Super Sensitive Lotion which has Calendula in it.   I read an earlier post where MomMom mentioned it. I go to Stanford Hospital in Palo Alto. They have a good reputation in Cancer care. Just in case Calendula sounds too \"natural\".",

The goal was to shrink the tumor from 3.5 cm in order to do a lumpectomy. It has worked. The tumor is 2.5 cm. However I have been wondering why I my MO didn't do chemo first. Originally I thought there was not a chemo package for HER2-/ER+, but reading on this blog sounds like there is. I am waiting for a call back from my MO but thought I would ask. My lumpectomy is next week, so at this point it is moot. Just curious though. Any thoughts?",
