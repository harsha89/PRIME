Already talked to breast surgeon who reviewed films with Radiologist on Friday.  They want to do a needle localization and open biopsy.  Hopefully I will hear from his RN on 12/23.  Surgeon is working 12/26 and 12/27, so I am hoping we can schedule it on one of those days.   Just wanted to touch base with anyone having a similar report, and wondering how things turned out! Thanks!  ",
