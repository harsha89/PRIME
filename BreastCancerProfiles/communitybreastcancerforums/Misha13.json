Yes staging can change after surgery, but it is unlikely that your mom will suddenly change stages dramatically. It sounds like she\u2019s a stage I or maybe II because of the cancer in the lymph node. It also sounds like her tumor is small. You said the tumor was grade two, that\u2019s good-it\u2019s not a super aggressive cancer. Another reason to stage it I or II, but even if it was a grade 3 cancer, it is still small, so stage I or II. I had cancer in a lymph node at diagnosis and so I had chemo first before surgery. My lymph node had a lot of cancer, so that\u2019s another reason why. The fact that your mom had surgery first is a good sign for a low stage. Even with my lymph node and 2cm tumor, I am stage II. After the pathology is returned, they will determine the next steps. Lymph node involvement usually means chemo. Before they start chemo, your mom will have an MRI and a Pet scan to look for metastasis, unless they\u2019ve done that already before her surgery. It is doubtful that there is any metastasis! Enjoy the rest of your Christmas break, enjoy spending time with your mom and don\u2019t let fear about what-ifs ruin another day. I hope I have been able to help a little!",

My surgeon was comfortable doing a skin and nipple sparing mastectomy with straight to implant reconstruction. However, there are a lot of factors docs take into consideration when deciding. With lumpectomy, I don\u2019t think you have that option because there are no implants. I was told by my surgeon that if I had a lumpectomy, my breast would get smaller. Once you meet with your surgeon, he or she will tell you your options for your case and can recommend the best option. PM me if you have any more questions. Good luck! ",
