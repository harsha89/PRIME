My husband and I have concert tickets very expensive concert tickets for May 24 but I really want this thing out of me. It wouldn't be such a big deal if he could drive us there but he cannot drive right now do to an injury he received on the job. I feel extremely resentful for feeling like I should put my surgery off because this is the one time in 11 years of marriage where there is something wrong with me when it is usually him. That sounds selfish right! Everything is so jumbled up in my mind I cannot think straight. I finally thought I came to a decision about my treatment today-having the lumpectomy w/ radiation and telling the doctor if it is anymore advanced than they thought then remove the breast but their is still part of me that says just have them removed- I am still undecided and confused!!!

I went for a baseline MRI because my sister was diagnosed last year at 41, so my doctor was being cautious. They found an area of enhancement, it was a line they saw that was following my milk duct, they did a biopsy and it came back as DCIS with micro invasion-Stage 0 to beginning of stage one. The scary part is that my doctor put in for an MRI six months ago and my insurance company denied it saying I did not need it.",

Jeanne I also have three young children so that is what is making me think to have the mastectomy and that my sister was diagnosed last year and had no option but to have the mastectomy. The doctors tell me my right breast looks fine but I know this will be weighing on me constantly. The oncologist told me the same thing that I have the same cure rate with the lumpectomy and radiation as I do with the mastectomy. Did they explain that to you because I do not understand that. The surgeon said she will go in remove the area, mark it, and then check my sentinal nodes, if they are clear-fine, if not she will keep removing them until they are clear. She does not expect to find the cancer there but she has to check. If this is anywhere else in my breast then I am certain I want the mastectomy!! Can you tell them that before surgery? This might sound like a silly question but after the masectomy there isn't any feeling left, right? Thanks for answering, Dawn",

Shirlann, I am sure you understand when you hear cancer it is hard to believe you are not in any danger but I do understand what you are saying. I think my decision would be a litte easier if I did not have three young children. I want to make the best decision to be around as long as possible for them. What is also confusing me is that the oncologist said I have the same chance of curing this with a lumpectomy and radiation as I do with a mastectomy. It does not make sense to me, if the breast is completely gone how can that be the same as just removing the section and radiating it? Is DCIS with microinvasion and neucrosis more dangerous than DCIS alone? Thank You for answering Dawn",

I went for a second opinion last night to the surgeon that removed my first lump five years ago and he is also the surgeon that did my sister's mastectomy. He took a lot of time to explain things to me and read my old reports and my new reports. He also explained about some recent medical articles he read about the latest findings about DCIS. He told me with the results of my biopsy and the  family history the only thing he would feel comfortable with is doing the mastectomy. He told me if I was one of his family members this is what he would tell me to do. I honestly feel this is the best decision because I would not be able to live my life as normally as possible having this constantly hanging over my head. I know there is always a chance of recurrence but this choice is the best one for me, it will make me feel the most comfortable!! He also said I should consider myself lucky because it was found on the MRI and found so early. So I actually feel relieved that I have made my decision. I have an appointment with the plastic surgeon on the 27th to see if we can schedule the mast. and the expanders at the same time. I am a teacher and I was hoping to wait to the end of the year to do this which is about six weeks away. Is that to long? I would like it out of me sooner but that would mean taking off the rest of the year and we only get ten paid sick days a year and finances are extremely tight right now. But if it to long to wait then so be it!! Thanks again Dawn",
