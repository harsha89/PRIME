MAMAC/DIGITAL BILAT DX MAMMOGRA Highly Suggestive of Malignancy Attending Radiologist: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Clinical History: Annual screening, lump in the upper outer right breast.Findings: Mammography and ultrasound:There are scattered fibroglandular tissues bilaterally (25-50% fibroglandular). On the right, the patient has developed grouped microcalcifications in the posterior third of the upper outer right breast, surrounded by increasingly dense tissue that has ill-defined margins, possibly a mass. There is no evidence of left-sided mass, architectural distortion or grouped microcalcifications. Further evaluation by spot magnification views of the right breast demonstrates a persistent mass with indistinct margins containing internal calcification, approximately 1.1 cm in diameter.There is no skin thickening, suspicious cluster of calcifications or dominant mass on the left. Left breast tomography demonstrates no evidence of suspicious mass or architectural distortion. Ultrasound: There is a 1.2 cm solid mass in the 11 o'clock position of the right breast 6 cm from the nipple, corresponding to the palpable abnormality on exam.This is circumscribed and mildly heterogeneous, with several internal foci of color Doppler flow.There is no evidence of adenopathy in the right axilla. Impression: New suspicious pleomorphic grouped calcifications in the right upper outer breast with associated sonographically visible mass, corresponding to the area of palpable abnormality indicated by the patient.Ultrasound guided biopsy recommended for further evaluation. This was performed in a separately dictated procedure immediately followed the diagnostic exam.

      "Content": "windingshores wrote: I was geared up to do Taxol and Herceptin based on a positive FISH HER2 test on biopsy (IHC was equivocal), along with grade 3. Testing on my mastectomy specimens however were negative by dual ISH (again IHC equivocal). An Oncotype done on the biopsy specimen, without my knowledge, that was not in the record, was just discovered, and has HER2 negative. At this point my doctors are considering me HER2 negative but I have concerns. I am ER/PR positive, 95% ER and 80% PR. The other testing inconsistency is that the just-discovered Oncotype Dx done on the biopsy specimen shows a low recurrence score. The pathologist at the hospital that ordered it thinks this is weird, since my ki67 was high, grade there was 3, and I had lymphovascular invasion. Pathology done on mastectomy specimens showed ki67 high at 20% (low end of high), grade 2/3, Her 2 1+/2+ on IHC and 1.2 on dual ISH (very different from the 2.1 obtained on the biopsy), mixed ductal and lobular in invasive part and CIS, DCIS with necrosis, lost e-cadherin in lobular parts, focal LVI. For weeks since my mastectomy I have been told I would be doing Herceptin and Taxol then hormonal treatment. I have not had radiation though it was mentioned at a second opinion in passing, due to LVI, but they said 4/5 radiology onc.'s would not suggest it. Due to the low Oncotype score, which I do not trust, I am now told that I will only do hormonal treatment. I want a new one done on the surgical specimen versus biopsy (which may have had more DCIS on slides, which could account for the lone HER2+). Does anyone else have highish grade, highish Ki67, and low Oncotype score. I am not eager to do chemo, don't get me wrong. If anything I would be interested in Herceptin with the ambiguous HER2- I have read that it can be taken alone. I have had two opinions (two hospitals in the same system) and my biopsy pathology was done in another hospital. I am confused and still worried whether hormonal treatment is enough in the context of some of my test results, especially grade and ki67. I am also confused as to why the Oncotype of the biopsy material is determining treatment when the HER2+ from that sample is being discounted (with the explanation that the Oncotype has it as negative- wouldn't a FISH be more reliable? IF DCIS in the sample explains the HER2+ wouldn't it also affect Oncotype and make it lower?) I know this is complicated and apologize if this is too much to post. If anyone else has had these inconsistencies would love to hear your treatment and outcome so far. Thank you!

The third MD did the retests I was hoping for, and I am still waiting for one test to come back. It is now 9 weeks from surgery. I hear a tick tick in my head! My first two opinions did not want to do chemo. Third one thinks I will probably end up doing it. I did get on an AI in the meantime, started about 6 weeks from surgery.

      "Content": "windingshores wrote: One hospital does an MRI of the \"good\" breast to make sure there is no cancer, or, alternatively, does a SNB, because there will never be a chance to find the sentinal nodes once the breast is gone. So if cancer is found (2% chance I am told, but...) then many nodes will need to go. Another hospital, the one I used for my first mastectomy, does not do this because the risk of cancer in the \"contralateral\" breast is so low. Any advice from those who had a BMX or two separate UMX's?

Around 7pm I just all of a sudden started shaking uncontrollably. I didn't really have any thoughts except that the fluishness and residual pain from biopsy made me feel all of a sudden that I had cancer everywhere in my body!! I called the covering MD at my primary's practice thinking something was terribly wrong, maybe a kidney infection-!! I am so embarrassed. I see my primary today. She was sweet to me on the phone. I barely know her: she found my lump on my very first appointment with her. The comments on here about panic were really helpful and I will ask for something in case it happens again. Also, getting up at 4 am every day. Children's chewable cherry Benadryl not making it for me! I have an appointment with a surgeon at the smaller hospital where the biopsy was done, tomorrow. Another appt. w/surgeon at Dana Farber next week but oncologist there not until 3/4. That seems so far away. I am thinking of calling back to see who else might be available or checking the schedules at MGH. I really don't know how much difference a few weeks makes but understand some may want to do treatment before surgery. I want a mastectomy, preferably double. Any advice on timing, delaying for the best cancer center versus going with smaller hospital surgeon, etc?

Is that right? Do I need to hurry the surgery up? I am trying to decide between mastectomy and lumpectomy. Originally I wanted a double mastectomy but MD today (not the one I am using) scared me about the time under anesthesia, hospital stay, drains etc. Lumpectomy would involve radiation and due to some autoimmune problems I am leery of that. Would love advice, experiences shared etc. Am seeing Dana Farber surgeon on Wed. Oncologist not until 3/4 but they told me if needed surgeon could consult or move the appt. up. Thanks!
