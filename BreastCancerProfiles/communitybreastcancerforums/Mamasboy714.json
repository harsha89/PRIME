I've watched my mother battle this thing for months and I'm so amazed by her strength and the strength of all of you. Stronger than any man I've ever known. My mom was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer in May. She started chemo treatment in June. They had her on cytoxan and another chemo drug that starts with an \"A\"...andro...something... Anyway,she had about 18 rounds of chemo. She lost her all her hair and her nails turned black. She developed naropathy in her hands and feet but suffered from no nausea and was able to go to work everyday. We were all so optimistic when it was time for the PEP scan results. To our devastation, the results showed that the tumor only shrank from a 6.3 to 5.7 and the core of the tumor which was suppose to get softer and translucent, according to the dr's, got harder and denser. How does chemo make it worse?! They diagnosed her at stage IV and said she had a 20% chance to live another 5 years. And the tumor had attached to the chest wall so they can't operate. Also, they found 2 very very small specs on her lungs, hence the stage IV diagnosis, but they are so small that they couldn't get a needle through it to do the biopsy. However, when she saw the radiologist, he was convinced that he could shrink the tumor by 80% and get it away from her chest. He was very optimistic while the other doctor was all doom and gloom. I don't know what to think! He started her on 40 rounds of radiation over the next 8 weeks (5x per week) and once a week she is getting chemo treatment. The chemo drug she is getting now is carboplatin. I researched this drug and it says that triple negative responds very well to this specific chemo therapy which is great. My mother was an RN for over 30 years and is a top nursing administrator so she knows her way around dr's and hospitals. She's keeping a positive attitude, started yoga and stopped eating chicken, beef, and pork adopting a plant based diet keeping dairy to a minimum. She doesn't drink soda (she use to down two bottles of Pepsi a day) and only drinks water, herbal tea, almond milk and some juices. I became a vegetarian with her just so she doesn't have to go through that journey alone. While visiting last week, she lifted her breast and I could see the tumor coming out. It was black and hard..it looked so evil and painful. It just broke my heart. I'm a mama's boy through and through. And proud of it. My mother is my best friend, hero and confidant. If I go 48 hours without talking to the lady I start leaving stalker like messages on her voicemail. lol. I feel like she's doing all the right things. But will the radiation work? Will the carboplatin work? Or is the doctor blowing smoke up our ass? Will the lifestyle change work? I'm terrified. Absolutely terrified. Log in to post a reply",

Right now she's only on the carboplatin. They had her on cytoxan and another one previously. She goes to the doc on Wednesday so I'll make sure to tell her to ask about gemzar. She said she wasn't on any medications accept for some nausea pills and stuff to combat the side effects but that's about it. Thanks for info. Everything helps.Â ",
