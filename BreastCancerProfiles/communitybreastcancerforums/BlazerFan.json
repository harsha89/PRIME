She said it was more like a thickening of the tissue, could't feel any real definative borders but was about 2cm by 2cm, and said to make another appointment after my next period. So I made the appointment with another doctor (for insurance reasons) and that was this morning. She said it didn't feel like a cyst and was guessing because of my age (23 almost 24) it was probably a fibroadenoma. She said if it was cancer it would probably have doubled in size from my last appointment which I told her was about a month ago. I told her it was 2 cm by 2 cm then and when she measure it this morning it was 2.5 cm by 4cm. She said that was concerning and now I am going to have a biopsy next week. My mom had cancer so I do have a family history. I'm trying so hard not to be worried but it's hard waiting! Does anyone think there is a chance that this is cancer because of how fast it is growing... even if I'm only 23?? Thanks for you support... it's been great reading these boards.
