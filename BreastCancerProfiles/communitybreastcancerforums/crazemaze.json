Never thought of that but my salon is literally under my condo..so I am definitely going to do this! Unfortunately my BS does not offer anesthesia before the insert ( I called) so will just take a pain pill and pray for the best. I'm sure it will be fine....and will keep thinking how grateful I am to be a candidate for the SAVI treatment and live in a city where this is an option. All My Best",

I felt some pain about a level 4/10 I would say. It does feel uncomfortable and heavy but besides that I have to say I am surprised how easy it was. My MRI biopsy was way more painful. I start radiation Monday and excited to be close to the finish line. Goodluck to all who are having this procedure... So far so good for me! All my best! crazemaze",

Have any of your doctors offered slight anesthesia ( laughing gas) when they insert and take out? Curious if this is an option? I'm getting anxious thinking of the pain. Had my lumpectomy and SNB and still really sore from the SNB ( but grateful my nodes are benign and margins are clear). Also can you at least take a bath with the device if u don't get it wet? Thanks for the helpful info!!!",
